intracellular atp changes to traditional cell counts throughout the growth curve of toxic cyanobacteria ii to evalulate the sensitivity of atp in detecting algal and cyanobacterial growth year round during routine monitoring of a surface water supply and iii to assess atp as an indicator of cell lysis and intracellular cyanotoxin release following oxidative e g free chlorine ozone and chemical cu

mc lr the first week of growth curve culturing and sampling was duplicated at a separate time to ensure reproducibility within the early detection timeframe at least three to five cultures were monitored on a rotating basis throughout the growth cycle to avoid bias by any one culture duplicate calibration curves correlating cell counts with od730 were obtained 2 2 source water sampling colorado river water crw in lake mead was sampled monthly at six locations shown in fig s1 in the si and analyzed for atp chlorophyll a chl a and total microcystins as mc lr equivalents via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa from december 2016 through october 2017 chl a was measured for composite samples at 0 6 m depth while atp was measured for samples at discrete depths of 0 or 12 m all lake mead samples were collected using a van dorn sample bottle a horizontal sampler that can be deployed in shallow or deep waters tertiary effluent from clark county water reclamation district which is subsequently disinfected and discharged to wetlands leading to lake mead was also sampled for atp three times during this period this established baseline data for source water as well as elucidated the influence of other bacteria in treated wastewater on atp measurements a duplicate atp measurement was obtained for a new sample site on each sampling date sampling details are provided

from reactors for oxidant measurements during the reactions total volume removed for this never exceeded 10 of the reactor volume upon measurement of no residual or 20 min whichever occurred first sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 was added to the reactors to quench any remaining residual the reactors were sampled immediately for total microcystin extracellular microcystin chl a and intracellular atp analyses control reactors included those with no chemical addition and those with na2s2o3 added cyanobacteria were not affected by na2s2o3 throughout the experiments experiments were duplicated for the no exposure control and middle oxidant doc ratio reactors except for o3 which only had a duplicate of the control reactor and not the middle o3 doc ratio in favor of adding a higher o3 doc ratio 0

coolers the water had a doc concentration of 9 3 mg l ph of 7 9 and predominantly contained planktothrix agardhii suspensa p agardhii suspensa 2 7 106 cells ml and planktolyngbya spp 3 7 105 cells ml fig s2 intracellular microcystin yr mc yr was present and thought to be produced by p agardhii suspense dumouchelle and stelzer 2014 while another microcystin variant or variants were detected as mc lr equivalents with elisa specific congeners beyond mc yr could not be identified with current commercially available standards samples of 1 l volume of glsm water were placed in amber glass bottles

light spectrophotometer hach dr 5000 and correlated with cell counts obtained using digital flow cytometry as described in previous work wert et al 2013 chl a was analyzed using standard method sm

results are given in the si for extracellular microcystin samples were simply filtered immediately following experiments lake mead samples were analyzed for total microcystins by epa method 546 using elisa abraxis lab cultured and glsm cyanobacteria cell suspensions were analyzed for eight microcystin congeners via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms as described in previous work wert et al 2014b free chlorine and total chlorine for monochloramine residuals were measured by sm 4500 cl g while ozone residuals were measured by sm 4500 o3 b permanganate residuals were also

provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyanobacteria growth curve development along with water quality parameters intracellular atp was monitored throughout the growth of m aeruginosa to assess the feasibility of using atp as a measure of cell density and metabolic activity cells reached the exponential phase at approximately 15 days and stationary phase by 30 days fig s3a simultaneously extracellular and total mc lr increased throughout the exponential phase as expected fig s3b od730 up to 0 297 cm 1 correlated with cell counts obtained via digital flow cytometry r2 0 998 fig 1 while od730 ranged from 0 001 to 0 297 cm 1 throughout growth as an indirect measure of cell concentration intracellular atp offered greater sensitivity as an indicator of microbial population ranging from 422 to 252 000 pg atp ml throughout the growth cycle atp strongly correlated with od730 r2 0 969 and therefore with cell counts concurrently atp correlated with total mc lr r2 0 985 for this strain of m aeruginosa fig s4 though it is noted that toxin production depends on cyanobacteria strain and environment atp correlated with cell count according to the following equation 1 cell count cells ml 71 9 intracellular atp pg ml 2 94 105 atp proved a particularly sensitive and rapid indicator of cyanobacteria cell presence at the early lag phase of the growth cycle showing utility for early detection of blooms even within the lowest od730 range 0 001 0 049 cm 1 at the start of growth intracellular atp scaled two orders of magnitude ranging from 422 to 25 100 pg atp ml and linearly correlated with od730 r2 0 861 inset of fig 1 although od730 of 0 040 cm 1 corresponded with little to no green visual appearance in the m aeruginosa culture the cell count was 2 106 cells ml the cell count for context the world health organization who considers 1 106 1 107 cells ml to be associated with high probability of acute health effects in recreational water who 2003 other analyses including chl a and cell counting require time on the order of days and taking a sample back to a laboratory bridgeman et al 2013 in contrast atp analysis can be conducted at a sampling site within 5 min approaching real time detection of a microbial bloom 3 2 source water monitoring to assess feasibility for detection of a cyanobacterial bloom in a drinking water source intracellular atp was monitored with other bulk water quality parameters at multiple locations within lake mead shown in fig 2 a throughout one year while atp remained relatively low 140 pg atp ml at locations c d and e in lake mead it exceeded 390 pg atp ml at locations a and b closest to influent from wastewater impacted wetlands during summer months fig 2 fig s5 notably intracellular atp correlated positively with chl a concentrations fig 2 fig s6 r2 0 791 including when chl a exceeded 5 μg l a standard adopted in colorado to control disinfection byproduct dbp formation saunders et al 2015 the atp threshold corresponding with 5 μg chl a l based on this relationship was 175 pg atp ml total microcystins were not detected via elisa during the study and elevated chl a concentrations in locations a and b have frequently corresponded with greater biomass of algal organisms rather than cyanobacteria in the past analysis of intracellular atp also revealed differences in biomass quantity related to sample depth and season fig s5 as expected surface samples with greater light penetration exhibited up to two fold greater atp concentrations at location b and adjacent location f when compared with b at 12 m depth these concentrations reaching a maximum of 2000 pg atp ml at b in september occurred during warmer months spanning from late march into october chl a displayed the same seasonal increase as atp with greatest concentrations predominantly ranging from 5 to 50 μg l at locations a and b this parameter was not measured at f due to shallow depth locations c d and e all had relatively low levels of atp 200 pg ml and chl a 6 μg l regardless of depth in the water column or season for comparison tertiary treated wastewater was assessed for intracellular atp throughout the year the average atp concentration was 294 174 pg ml fig s7 while this was greater than the levels observed at locations c d and e in lake mead it was approximately the same or less than the elevated concentrations at a b and f moreover intracellular atp at the start of the m aeruginosa growth curve was predominantly greater than in the tertiary treated wastewater highlighting the order of magnitude that can serve in differentiating a bacterial cyanobacterial bloom from a wastewater expected to contain bacteria prior to disinfection atp analysis compares favorably with currently used monitoring technologies and would pair well with more time consuming techniques centered on toxin detection and cyanobacterial species identification predominant online monitoring technologies like fluorometric probes that detect in situ intracellular fluorescence from phycocyanin a pigment specific to cyanobacteria are susceptible to interference from turbidity light scattering particles and different cyanobacterial morphologies e g filaments colonies zamyadi et al 2016 the fluorescence of cyanobacterial pigments can also be susceptible to interference from natural organic matter and or organic matter released from cells korak et al 2015 as a more direct measurement of cellular integrity atp analysis circumvents these interferences and exceeds background concentrations from indigenous phytoplankton by orders of magnitude after initial indication of a bloom through this analysis further confirmation of cyanobacteria species via microscopy or genetic sequencing and of toxin presence or absence would allow development of water management treatment strategies of note cyanobacteria blooms are not homogenous and atp measurement does not account for mixtures cell viability genus variations presence of green algae and or other phytoplankton that may be present during a biological proliferation or event 3 3 oxidation of laboratory cultured cyanobacteria in source water the efficacy of intracellular atp was evaluated following treatment of laboratory cultured m aeruginosa suspended in crw with nh2cl o3 mno4 and cl2 m aeruginosa was treated using nh2cl doc ratios from 0 05 to 0 5 corresponding with doses of 0 13 1 25 mg l for crw with doc of 2 5 mg l for 20 min residuals are shown in fig 3 a within this timeframe nh2cl did not affect chl a intracellular atp and extracellular and total mc lr fig 3b and c therefore intracellular atp was consistent with the chl a and mc lr results when cells were treated with o3 doc ratios from 0 05 to 0 75 corresponding with doses of 0 13 1 88 mg l exposure to the oxidant was 1 min or less fig 4 a chl a decreased from 98 2 μg l without exposure to 74 μg l at 0 25 o3 doc 55 μg l at 0 5 o3 doc and 20 μg l at 0 75 o3 doc fig 4b meanwhile atp decreased from 13 600 700 pg ml without exposure to 3630 pg ml 607 pg ml and 420 pg ml respectively at 0 25 o3 doc minimal intracellular mc lr was released from cells and at 0 5 o3 doc total mc lr was substantially oxidized fig 4c total mc lr was oxidized to a level below the method reporting limit mrl at 0 75 o3 doc while chl a decreased nearly five fold at the highest ozone exposure intracellular atp dropped by an order of magnitude showing greater sensitivity as a measure of cell health the drastic decrease in atp was consistent with the oxidation of total mc lr which indicated that cell integrity was compromised cells were treated with mno4 doc ratios from 0 1 to 4 corresponding with doses of 0 25 10 mg l for 20 min fig 5 a chl a decreased from 61 9 μg l no exposure to 36 pg ml with 2 mno4 doc and 32 pg ml with 4 mno4 doc fig 5b atp decreased from 9800 2100 pg ml to 2540 pg ml and 487 pg ml respectively intracellular mc lr was minimally released at 2 mno4 doc with some total mc lr oxidized at 4 mno4 doc fig 5c similar to trends seen with ozone while chl a halved across the exposures intracellular atp decreased by an order of magnitude showing enhanced sensitivity notably this corresponded with complete release of intracellular mc lr at 4 mno4 doc though not all mc lr was oxidized by mno4 within 20 min when treated with cl2 doc ratios from 0 05 to 0 5 corresponding with doses of 0 13 1 25 mg l 0 5 cl2 doc had a contact time of 20 min 0 25 cl2 doc persisted to 12 min and 0 15 and less cl2 doc lasted 6 min or less fig 6 a chl a decreased from 100 21 μg l without exposure to 57 μg l with 0 5 cl2 doc fig 6b notably atp decreased from 19 500 500 pg ml without exposure to 970 220 pg ml with 0 15 cl2 doc and 150 pg ml with 0 25 and 0 5 cl2 doc while 0 25 cl2 doc did not result in release nor oxidation of mc lr 0 5 cl2 doc oxidized most of the total mc lr fig 6c while chl a did not show a consistent decreasing trend across the exposures fig 6b intracellular atp decreased by an order of magnitude for the two highest cl2 doc ratios the oxidation of mc lr at 0 5 cl2 doc also demonstrated that cell integrity was compromised these four cases demonstrate the efficacy of atp measurement in assessing cyanobacteria cell lysis which can be incorporated into utility guidance the evaluation of nh2cl represented a negative control test where no cellular degradation nor intracellular release was observed or expected as it is a weak oxidant however higher exposures to o3 mno4 and cl2 completely released intracellular mc lr which corresponded with order of magnitude decreases in intracellular atp these decreases in atp are analogous to the log removals of escherichia coli from water achieved through chlorination nescerecka et al 2016 and ozonation which likewise corresponded with decreases in intracellular atp lee et al 2016 when using an oxidation process to lyse cells and fully release cyanotoxins for subsequent treatment as can be done with o3 or cl2 a target intracellular atp value of 100 pg ml should be recommended based on findings herein however the high dose of mno4 10 mg l required to near 100 pg ml intracellular atp would render the water pink likely preventing the oxidant s use when cell lysis is the targeted goal while chl a was relatively unchanged minimally decreased with certain oxidant exposures intracellular atp proved a significantly more sensitive indicator of damage to cells and the efficacy of treatment 3 4 copper treatment of naturally occurring cyanobacteria in source water ultimately intracellular atp was used to evaluate the efficacy of chemical treatment of source water experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom intracellular atp in glsm water was predominantly associated with p agardhii suspensa atp was reduced by an order of magnitude from 13 500 7700 to 780 pg ml with 0 5 mg l cu ii applied and by nearly another order of magnitude down to 130 20 pg ml with 2 5 mg l cu ii fig 7 a meanwhile chl a did not vary noticeably with the application of cu ii within the range of cu ii doses examined mc yr was not released from cells during the 24 h exposure period fig 7b further there was minimal release of the other microcystin variant s detected via elisa fig s8 intracellular atp showed significant sensitivity as a first indicator related to the damage inflicted on cyanobacteria following treatment consistent with the trends observed for oxidative treatment furthermore atp can offer insight into loss of integrity of cyanobacteria cells that may otherwise look intact with cell counting p agardhii suspensa a filamentous species of cyanobacteria can be particularly recalcitrant to treatment and release of metabolites due to its morphology wert et al 2014a while previous work has shown atp to correlate with cyanobacteria pigments those of nostoc sp pcc 9104 during biocidal treatment sanmartín et al 2015 other work has shown that chl a may not change with relatively low oxidant exposures wert et al 2013 measurement of intracellular atp therefore can be used to assess cells that have been partially damaged but still retain pigments interference of cu ii with the atp assay was examined to ensure accurate results concentrations from 0 5 to 5 7 mg l cu ii did not impact atp concentration readings by the luminescence method fig s9 however inhibition of luminescence and reduction of atp concentration readings from 30 to 400 pg ml occurred from 10 to 500 mg l cu ii therefore care must be exercised in the application of the luminescence based atp test in real and chemically treated water matrices special handling of samples such as using resin beads recommended for atp analysis of wastewater containing metals can improve use of the assay for cyanobacteria laden water undergoing copper treatment mazzochette 2013 3 5 atp content of cyanobacteria cells the intracellular atp contents pg atp cyanobacteria cell were quantified for lab cultured m aeruginosa cells and naturally occurring p agardhii suspensa cells from glsm based on the growth curve correlation of intracellular atp to cell count fig 1 equation 1 the calculated intracellular atp content of a m aeruginosa cell was 9 8 10 3 pg atp cell or 1 9 10 8 nmol atp cell these values were similar to those obtained experimentally for 1 0 106 cells ml suspensions used in oxidation experiments 1 3 0 4 10 2 pg atp cell or 2 6 0 8 10 8 nmol atp cell ultimately based on the approximate spherical diameter of 5 μm for a m aeruginosa cell these correspond to 7 3 10 10 and 9 9 3 0 10 10 nmol atp μm3 of biovolume respectively the intracellular atp content of these cells are similar to that found for other bacteria 1 75 10 10 nmol atp cell or 2 95 10 9 nmol atp μm3 hammes et al 2010 however the intracellular atp content of p agardhii suspensa is less at 5 0 10 3 pg atp cell or 9 9 10 9 nmol atp cell while this is similar to the atp content of m aeruginosa what constitutes a single cell for p agardhii suspensa is considerably more biovolume with cell filament sizes ranging from 2 to 10 μm in diameter and up to 4 mm in length anagnostidis and komárek 1988 this illustrates the importance of cell morphology and origin lab versus naturally occurring in contextualizing atp content while a single correlation between atp and cell counts would likely not be uniform across all cyanobacteria species and could be impacted by the presence of indigenous bacteria and green algae a threshold for atp may prove most useful in cyanobacteria detection and mitigation much like the current use of cell counts for these purposes 4 conclusions limited work has assessed the use of atp testing to monitor cyanobacteria to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to holistically evaluate the luminescence based assay for monitoring the cyanobacterial growth cycle detecting presence of photosynthetic organisms in source water and examining efficacy of chemical treatment of cyanobacterial blooms a primary benefit of atp testing is the relatively minimal time required for analysis on the order of minutes compared with the extended time required to analyze for other parameters e g cell counts chl a atp also demonstrated greater sensitivity than od730 a similarly rapid analysis used to assess bacterial populations as a direct measure of a molecule associated with cellular metabolic activity it can also circumvent interference from natural organic matter and other compounds encountered by probes that measure optical properties of water and in situ cellular pigments from this study we established preliminary framework for atp as an early warning system with a threshold of 175 pg atp ml corresponding with 5 μg l chl a and a moderate risk level in lake mead within the context of the cyanobacteria growth cycle this quantity corresponded with the lag phase before exponential growth of lab cultured m aeruginosa and thus the timeframe in which early detection and monitoring is most critical for a cyanobacterial bloom in oxidative and chemical treatment of cyanobacteria intracellular atp served as a significantly more sensitive indicator of cell damage than chl a atp frequently corresponded with cyanotoxin release even when chl a remained unchanged further a threshold value of 100 pg atp ml was recommended for complete release of intracellular cyanotoxins atp also provides another tool for early detection of bioactivity in water supplies that have been historically susceptible to random cyanobacteria blooms although the amount of intracellular atp may vary across living organisms and species increases observed herein correlated well with traditional cyanobacterial parameters i e chl a and cell counts and exceeded background concentrations from indigenous phytoplankton by orders of magnitude making it an excellent first indicator of algal cyanobacterial presence and metabolic activity declaration of interests none acknowledgements the authors thank the

optimized treatment of cyanobacterial blooms warrants investigation furthermore the recent availability of atp online analyzers places this technology in a prime position for source and drinking water monitoring here atp was used to evaluate cyanobacteria growth under laboratory controlled and natural conditions the objectives of this study were i to compare the magnitude and sensitivity of intracellular atp changes to traditional cell counts throughout the growth curve of toxic cyanobacteria ii to evalulate the sensitivity of atp in detecting algal and cyanobacterial growth year round during routine monitoring of a surface water supply and iii to assess atp as an indicator of cell lysis and intracellular cyanotoxin release following oxidative e g free chlorine ozone and chemical cu ii treatment processes applied to surface waters containing toxic cyanobacteria while cyanotoxin concentrations were measured during oxidative and chemical treatment atp cannot be used to

monitored on a rotating basis throughout the growth cycle to avoid bias by any one culture duplicate calibration curves correlating cell counts with od730 were obtained 2 2 source water sampling colorado river water crw in lake mead was sampled monthly at six locations shown in fig s1 in the si and analyzed for atp chlorophyll a chl a and total microcystins as mc lr equivalents via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa from december 2016 through october 2017 chl a was measured for composite samples at 0 6 m depth while atp was measured for samples at discrete depths of 0 or 12 m all lake mead samples were collected using a van dorn sample bottle a horizontal sampler that can be deployed in shallow or deep waters tertiary effluent from clark county water reclamation district which is subsequently disinfected and discharged to wetlands leading to lake mead was also sampled for atp three times during this period this established baseline data for source water as well as

sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 was added to the reactors to quench any remaining residual the reactors were sampled immediately for total microcystin extracellular microcystin chl a and intracellular atp analyses control reactors included those with no chemical addition and those with na2s2o3 added cyanobacteria were not affected by na2s2o3 throughout the experiments experiments were duplicated for the no exposure control and middle oxidant doc ratio reactors except for o3 which only had a duplicate of the control reactor and not the middle o3 doc ratio in favor of adding a higher o3 doc ratio 0

light spectrophotometer hach dr 5000 and correlated with cell counts obtained using digital flow cytometry as described in previous work wert et al 2013 chl a was analyzed using standard method sm

provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyanobacteria growth curve development along with water quality parameters intracellular atp was monitored throughout the growth of m aeruginosa to assess the feasibility of using atp as a measure of cell density and metabolic activity cells reached the exponential phase at approximately 15 days and stationary phase by 30 days fig s3a simultaneously extracellular and total mc lr increased throughout the exponential phase as expected fig s3b od730 up to 0 297 cm 1 correlated with cell counts obtained via digital flow cytometry r2 0 998 fig 1 while od730 ranged from 0 001 to 0 297 cm 1 throughout growth as an indirect measure of cell concentration intracellular atp offered greater sensitivity as an indicator of microbial population ranging from 422 to 252 000 pg atp ml throughout the growth cycle atp strongly correlated with od730 r2 0 969 and therefore with cell counts concurrently atp correlated with total mc lr r2 0 985 for this strain of m aeruginosa fig s4 though it is noted that toxin production depends on cyanobacteria strain and environment atp correlated with cell count according to the following equation 1 cell count cells ml 71 9 intracellular atp pg ml 2 94 105 atp proved a particularly sensitive and rapid indicator of cyanobacteria cell presence at the early lag phase of the growth cycle showing utility for early detection of blooms even within the lowest od730 range 0 001 0 049 cm 1 at the start of growth intracellular atp scaled two orders of magnitude ranging from 422 to 25 100 pg atp ml and linearly correlated with od730 r2 0 861 inset of fig 1 although od730 of 0 040 cm 1 corresponded with little to no green visual appearance in the m aeruginosa culture the cell count was 2 106 cells ml the cell count for context the world health organization who considers 1 106 1 107 cells ml to be associated with high probability of acute health effects in recreational water who 2003 other analyses including chl a and cell counting require time on the order of days and taking a sample back to a laboratory bridgeman et al 2013 in contrast atp analysis can be conducted at a sampling site within 5 min approaching real time detection of a microbial bloom 3 2 source water monitoring to assess feasibility for detection of a cyanobacterial bloom in a drinking water source intracellular atp was monitored with other bulk water quality parameters at multiple locations within lake mead shown in fig 2 a throughout one year while atp remained relatively low 140 pg atp ml at locations c d and e in lake mead it exceeded 390 pg atp ml at locations a and b closest to influent from wastewater impacted wetlands during summer months fig 2 fig s5 notably intracellular atp correlated positively with chl a concentrations fig 2 fig s6 r2 0 791 including when chl a exceeded 5 μg l a standard adopted in colorado to control disinfection byproduct dbp formation saunders et al 2015 the atp threshold corresponding with 5 μg chl a l based on this relationship was 175 pg atp ml total microcystins were not detected via elisa during the study and elevated chl a concentrations in locations a and b have frequently corresponded with greater biomass of algal organisms rather than cyanobacteria in the past analysis of intracellular atp also revealed differences in biomass quantity related to sample depth and season fig s5 as expected surface samples with greater light penetration exhibited up to two fold greater atp concentrations at location b and adjacent location f when compared with b at 12 m depth these concentrations reaching a maximum of 2000 pg atp ml at b in september occurred during warmer months spanning from late march into october chl a displayed the same seasonal increase as atp with greatest concentrations predominantly ranging from 5 to 50 μg l at locations a and b this parameter was not measured at f due to shallow depth locations c d and e all had relatively low levels of atp 200 pg ml and chl a 6 μg l regardless of depth in the water column or season for comparison tertiary treated wastewater was assessed for intracellular atp throughout the year the average atp concentration was 294 174 pg ml fig s7 while this was greater than the levels observed at locations c d and e in lake mead it was approximately the same or less than the elevated concentrations at a b and f moreover intracellular atp at the start of the m aeruginosa growth curve was predominantly greater than in the tertiary treated wastewater highlighting the order of magnitude that can serve in differentiating a bacterial cyanobacterial bloom from a wastewater expected to contain bacteria prior to disinfection atp analysis compares favorably with currently used monitoring technologies and would pair well with more time consuming techniques centered on toxin detection and cyanobacterial species identification predominant online monitoring technologies like fluorometric probes that detect in situ intracellular fluorescence from phycocyanin a pigment specific to cyanobacteria are susceptible to interference from turbidity light scattering particles and different cyanobacterial morphologies e g filaments colonies zamyadi et al 2016 the fluorescence of cyanobacterial pigments can also be susceptible to interference from natural organic matter and or organic matter released from cells korak et al 2015 as a more direct measurement of cellular integrity atp analysis circumvents these interferences and exceeds background concentrations from indigenous phytoplankton by orders of magnitude after initial indication of a bloom through this analysis further confirmation of cyanobacteria species via microscopy or genetic sequencing and of toxin presence or absence would allow development of water management treatment strategies of note cyanobacteria blooms are not homogenous and atp measurement does not account for mixtures cell viability genus variations presence of green algae and or other phytoplankton that may be present during a biological proliferation or event 3 3 oxidation of laboratory cultured cyanobacteria in source water the efficacy of intracellular atp was evaluated following treatment of laboratory cultured m aeruginosa suspended in crw with nh2cl o3 mno4 and cl2 m aeruginosa was treated using nh2cl doc ratios from 0 05 to 0 5 corresponding with doses of 0 13 1 25 mg l for crw with doc of 2 5 mg l for 20 min residuals are shown in fig 3 a within this timeframe nh2cl did not affect chl a intracellular atp and extracellular and total mc lr fig 3b and c therefore intracellular atp was consistent with the chl a and mc lr results when cells were treated with o3 doc ratios from 0 05 to 0 75 corresponding with doses of 0 13 1 88 mg l exposure to the oxidant was 1 min or less fig 4 a chl a decreased from 98 2 μg l without exposure to 74 μg l at 0 25 o3 doc 55 μg l at 0 5 o3 doc and 20 μg l at 0 75 o3 doc fig 4b meanwhile atp decreased from 13 600 700 pg ml without exposure to 3630 pg ml 607 pg ml and 420 pg ml respectively at 0 25 o3 doc minimal intracellular mc lr was released from cells and at 0 5 o3 doc total mc lr was substantially oxidized fig 4c total mc lr was oxidized to a level below the method reporting limit mrl at 0 75 o3 doc while chl a decreased nearly five fold at the highest ozone exposure intracellular atp dropped by an order of magnitude showing greater sensitivity as a measure of cell health the drastic decrease in atp was consistent with the oxidation of total mc lr which indicated that cell integrity was compromised cells were treated with mno4 doc ratios from 0 1 to 4 corresponding with doses of 0 25 10 mg l for 20 min fig 5 a chl a decreased from 61 9 μg l no exposure to 36 pg ml with 2 mno4 doc and 32 pg ml with 4 mno4 doc fig 5b atp decreased from 9800 2100 pg ml to 2540 pg ml and 487 pg ml respectively intracellular mc lr was minimally released at 2 mno4 doc with some total mc lr oxidized at 4 mno4 doc fig 5c similar to trends seen with ozone while chl a halved across the exposures intracellular atp decreased by an order of magnitude showing enhanced sensitivity notably this corresponded with complete release of intracellular mc lr at 4 mno4 doc though not all mc lr was oxidized by mno4 within 20 min when treated with cl2 doc ratios from 0 05 to 0 5 corresponding with doses of 0 13 1 25 mg l 0 5 cl2 doc had a contact time of 20 min 0 25 cl2 doc persisted to 12 min and 0 15 and less cl2 doc lasted 6 min or less fig 6 a chl a decreased from 100 21 μg l without exposure to 57 μg l with 0 5 cl2 doc fig 6b notably atp decreased from 19 500 500 pg ml without exposure to 970 220 pg ml with 0 15 cl2 doc and 150 pg ml with 0 25 and 0 5 cl2 doc while 0 25 cl2 doc did not result in release nor oxidation of mc lr 0 5 cl2 doc oxidized most of the total mc lr fig 6c while chl a did not show a consistent decreasing trend across the exposures fig 6b intracellular atp decreased by an order of magnitude for the two highest cl2 doc ratios the oxidation of mc lr at 0 5 cl2 doc also demonstrated that cell integrity was compromised these four cases demonstrate the efficacy of atp measurement in assessing cyanobacteria cell lysis which can be incorporated into utility guidance the evaluation of nh2cl represented a negative control test where no cellular degradation nor intracellular release was observed or expected as it is a weak oxidant however higher exposures to o3 mno4 and cl2 completely released intracellular mc lr which corresponded with order of magnitude decreases in intracellular atp these decreases in atp are analogous to the log removals of escherichia coli from water achieved through chlorination nescerecka et al 2016 and ozonation which likewise corresponded with decreases in intracellular atp lee et al 2016 when using an oxidation process to lyse cells and fully release cyanotoxins for subsequent treatment as can be done with o3 or cl2 a target intracellular atp value of 100 pg ml should be recommended based on findings herein however the high dose of mno4 10 mg l required to near 100 pg ml intracellular atp would render the water pink likely preventing the oxidant s use when cell lysis is the targeted goal while chl a was relatively unchanged minimally decreased with certain oxidant exposures intracellular atp proved a significantly more sensitive indicator of damage to cells and the efficacy of treatment 3 4 copper treatment of naturally occurring cyanobacteria in source water ultimately intracellular atp was used to evaluate the efficacy of chemical treatment of source water experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom intracellular atp in glsm water was predominantly associated with p agardhii suspensa atp was reduced by an order of magnitude from 13 500 7700 to 780 pg ml with 0 5 mg l cu ii applied and by nearly another order of magnitude down to 130 20 pg ml with 2 5 mg l cu ii fig 7 a meanwhile chl a did not vary noticeably with the application of cu ii within the range of cu ii doses examined mc yr was not released from cells during the 24 h exposure period fig 7b further there was minimal release of the other microcystin variant s detected via elisa fig s8 intracellular atp showed significant sensitivity as a first indicator related to the damage inflicted on cyanobacteria following treatment consistent with the trends observed for oxidative treatment furthermore atp can offer insight into loss of integrity of cyanobacteria cells that may otherwise look intact with cell counting p agardhii suspensa a filamentous species of cyanobacteria can be particularly recalcitrant to treatment and release of metabolites due to its morphology wert et al 2014a while previous work has shown atp to correlate with cyanobacteria pigments those of nostoc sp pcc 9104 during biocidal treatment sanmartín et al 2015 other work has shown that chl a may not change with relatively low oxidant exposures wert et al 2013 measurement of intracellular atp therefore can be used to assess cells that have been partially damaged but still retain pigments interference of cu ii with the atp assay was examined to ensure accurate results concentrations from 0 5 to 5 7 mg l cu ii did not impact atp concentration readings by the luminescence method fig s9 however inhibition of luminescence and reduction of atp concentration readings from 30 to 400 pg ml occurred from 10 to 500 mg l cu ii therefore care must be exercised in the application of the luminescence based atp test in real and chemically treated water matrices special handling of samples such as using resin beads recommended for atp analysis of wastewater containing metals can improve use of the assay for cyanobacteria laden water undergoing copper treatment mazzochette 2013 3 5 atp content of cyanobacteria cells the intracellular atp contents pg atp cyanobacteria cell were quantified for lab cultured m aeruginosa cells and naturally occurring p agardhii suspensa cells from glsm based on the growth curve correlation of intracellular atp to cell count fig 1 equation 1 the calculated intracellular atp content of a m aeruginosa cell was 9 8 10 3 pg atp cell or 1 9 10 8 nmol atp cell these values were similar to those obtained experimentally for 1 0 106 cells ml suspensions used in oxidation experiments 1 3 0 4 10 2 pg atp cell or 2 6 0 8 10 8 nmol atp cell ultimately based on the approximate spherical diameter of 5 μm for a m aeruginosa cell these correspond to 7 3 10 10 and 9 9 3 0 10 10 nmol atp μm3 of biovolume respectively the intracellular atp content of these cells are similar to that found for other bacteria 1 75 10 10 nmol atp cell or 2 95 10 9 nmol atp μm3 hammes et al 2010 however the intracellular atp content of p agardhii suspensa is less at 5 0 10 3 pg atp cell or 9 9 10 9 nmol atp cell while this is similar to the atp content of m aeruginosa what constitutes a single cell for p agardhii suspensa is considerably more biovolume with cell filament sizes ranging from 2 to 10 μm in diameter and up to 4 mm in length anagnostidis and komárek 1988 this illustrates the importance of cell morphology and origin lab versus naturally occurring in contextualizing atp content while a single correlation between atp and cell counts would likely not be uniform across all cyanobacteria species and could be impacted by the presence of indigenous bacteria and green algae a threshold for atp may prove most useful in cyanobacteria detection and mitigation much like the current use of cell counts for these purposes 4 conclusions limited work has assessed the use of atp testing to monitor cyanobacteria to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to holistically evaluate the luminescence based assay for monitoring the cyanobacterial growth cycle detecting presence of photosynthetic organisms in source water and examining efficacy of chemical treatment of cyanobacterial blooms a primary benefit of atp testing is the relatively minimal time required for analysis on the order of minutes compared with the extended time required to analyze for other parameters e g cell counts chl a atp also demonstrated greater sensitivity than od730 a similarly rapid analysis used to assess bacterial populations as a direct measure of a molecule associated with cellular metabolic activity it can also circumvent interference from natural organic matter and other compounds encountered by probes that measure optical properties of water and in situ cellular pigments from this study we established preliminary framework for atp as an early warning system with a threshold of 175 pg atp ml corresponding with 5 μg l chl a and a moderate risk level in lake mead within the context of the cyanobacteria growth cycle this quantity corresponded with the lag phase before exponential growth of lab cultured m aeruginosa and thus the timeframe in which early detection and monitoring is most critical for a cyanobacterial bloom in oxidative and chemical treatment of cyanobacteria intracellular atp served as a significantly more sensitive indicator of cell damage than chl a atp frequently corresponded with cyanotoxin release even when chl a remained unchanged further a threshold value of 100 pg atp ml was recommended for complete release of intracellular cyanotoxins atp also provides another tool for early detection of bioactivity in water supplies that have been historically susceptible to random cyanobacteria blooms although the amount of intracellular atp may vary across living organisms and species increases observed herein correlated well with traditional cyanobacterial parameters i e chl a and cell counts and exceeded background concentrations from indigenous phytoplankton by orders of magnitude making it an excellent first indicator of algal cyanobacterial presence and metabolic activity declaration of interests none acknowledgements the authors thank the

18976,anammox granular sludge biotechnology has been successfully applied in the environmental engineering for nitrogen removal from wastewater however the startup and control of anammox process was difficult and lacks an easy recognized indicator in this work the texture of anammox sludge bed in a long term 15 months stable operated and high rate anammox reactor was investigated for the first time the results showed that the anammox sludge bed took on the unique texture which was closely related to the biological loading rates of sludge bed at different heights of the reactor the texture was ascribed to the pattern created by granule gradation granules size distribution and granule number density spaces between granules the sludge bed texture displayed the distinctive vision and could be characterized by the reflected light of sludge bed the lightness indicator was found to have an excellent linear relationship with the height of anammox sludge bed the texture of anammox sludge bed was revealed to originate from the periodic cycle of gas driven segregation and density based aggregation of granules the results hint at a convenient and efficient strategy for operators to assess and control the working state of anammox system graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox sludge bed texture composition lightness granules migration 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a biological process converting ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas via anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob kuenen et al 2008 kartal et al 2011 compared with conventional nitrification denitrification process anammox is demonstrated with obvious advantages such as no addition of organic compounds no requirement for aeration and high efficiency for nitrogen removal fux and siegrist 2004 making it a promising biotechnology for nitrogen removal kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 the first full scale anammox reactor in the world had been constructed in rotterdam netherlands in 2002 van der star et al 2007 nowadays more than 120 full scale anammox reactors have been put into use around the world ali and okabe 2015 anammox process has shown its broad application prospects in the biological wastewater treatment the biotechnology based on granular sludge is a promising alternative for the wastewater treatment and offers numerous operational and economic advantages over the conventional systems based on floccular sludge barr et al 2010 the granular sludge was firstly observed in the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor hulshoff pol et al 1983 lettinga et al 1983 and was also observed in the aerobic systems later dangcong et al 1999 adav et al 2008 franca et al 2017 recently the granular sludge properties have been critically reviewed winkler et al 2017 it has also been demonstrated that anaob are prone to granulation because of the high level extracellular polymeric substance eps and the strong hydrophobic surface relative to the activated sludge nitrifying sludge and denitrifying sludge ni et al 2010 hou et al 2015 ali et al 2018 the systems based on anammox granular sludge are often taken as preferred choice for nitrogen removal from wastewaters due to the good biomass retention and high volumetric loading rate abma et al 2007 tang et al 2017 in fact granular sludges are self immobilized microbial aggregates the microorganisms are capable of interacting and attaching to each other and aggregate to form the granules cooperatively the biodiversity and abundance of microbial community determine the specific function of granular sludge a granule harbors a particular microbial community and holds a particular metabolic capacity the granules make up the sludge bed which is responsible for the overall reactor s performance schmidt and ahring 1996 a granule is an independent structure unit of the reactor after the long term mutual interactions between granules nutrients and waterflow the granular sludges were sculptured and stabilized to show up specific morphological characteristics all the morphological properties of granular sludge e g color size shape and density are the reflection of microbial community and its physiological function kang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 the integrity and density of granular sludge determine the space distribution each granule is different from the other granules with the unique morphology properties accumulate to form the sludge bed and endow the overall sludge bed or sludge pile a distinctive and identifiable vision however the relationship between the morphology and the specific activity of granular sludge the integrated pattern of sludge bed and the reactor s performance still remains unclear and needs further research earlier research has shown that particle size and density induced segregation of granules occurred as a function of height over a settled sludge bed in the aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor sbr system according to the phenomenon a method for selective sludge removal was put forward to control the microbial community and in turn to optimize the reactor performance winkler et al 2011a 2011b however different from the aerobic system where granules were driven by extra aeration zhou et al 2016 the anammox granules could generate gas inside accumulate and finally release from the sludge bed so far there is no available information about the migration behavior of granules in the continuous anammox reactor and the visual feature of anammox sludge bed was unknown in the present work a long term stable operated 15 months and high rate anammox reactor was taken to investigate the sludge bed texture the objectives of this research were 1 to observe the reactor

cylinder for 30 min the height of sludge water interface was recorded as h and the voidage ε could be calculated by the equation ε 1 h h0 2 4 optical characterization of sludge bed the optical characterization of sludge bed was determined by a cm 5 spectrophotometer konica minolta japan spectrometry is currently the mainstream technology for color measurement the light emitted by the inside illuminant shines on the sample the reflected light enters the spectral dispersion system and then analyzed by the array sensor the final color value is obtained and represented in the color space l a

dish measurement model and d65 illuminant were set the spectrophotometer was firstly calibrated using the purified water then the granular sludges at day 400 were put into the peri dish to guarantee that the bottom was fully covered after that the peri dish was filled with the blank water at last the peri dish was covered with a black hood to avoid the disturbance of surrounding lights after each measurement the dish was rotated 90 clockwise each sample was measured for 4 times from different directions to take the average kang et al 2018 2 5 chemical analysis the ammonium nitrite nitrate

6 fluid pattern simulation the fluid pattern in the reactor was simulated by ansys fluent 15 0 software using eulerian model and the procedure was described in detail in supplementary information 3 results 3 1 performance of anammox system the anammox bioreactor was run at the steady state for more than 450 days 15 months and achieve stable and high rate performance as shown in fig 2 the influent ammonium nitrite and tn were 279 32 337 30 and 616 59 mg n l respectively the effluent ammonium nitrite nitrate and tn were determined as 2 11 3 36 3 24 5 40 60 8 6 7 and 66 2 9 9 mg n l respectively fig 2a the removal efficiency of ammonium and nitrite was 99 2 1 1 and 99 1 1 6 the removal efficiency of tn was 89 2 2 0 fig 2b close to 87 9 which was calculated according to eq 1

g l the biological removal rate was calculated as 0 58 kg n kg vss d no ph control was conducted during the experiment but the ph fluctuation of the reactor was in 7 0 8 5 which satisfied the optimal range for anaob strous et al 1997 from fig 2c the reaction molar ratio of δno2 δnh4 and δno 3 δnh4 were calculated as 1 22 0 09 and 0 22 0 04 respectively which were close to the values of 1 32 and 0 26 reported in previous literature strous et al 1998 3 2 morphology observation of anammox granules the morphology including the shape and size of anammox granular sludges taken from different heights of sludge bed were observed qualitatively and they showed a visible difference fig 3 the bottom of the reaction zone was set as 0 cm in the top section 80 cm most granules were fine with the size less than 1 mm the fine granules were loose without a definite shape they were semi transparent with a blurred boundary occasionally irregular extra coarse or coarse granules were observed fig 3a in the middle upper section 50 cm most granules were medium up to 1 mm or coarse up to 2 mm the medium granules were in the shape of short rod and they were also semi transparent but with a clear boundary the coarse granules were compact fig 3b in the middle lower section 30 cm most granules were coarse and near spherical some granules were extra coarse 2 mm fig 3c in the bottom section 10 cm most granules were extra coarse a few fine granules and flocs filled in the gaps between coarse granules fig 3d 3 3 size distribution of anammox granules the size distribution of anammox granular sludges taken from different heights of sludge bed were determined quantitatively it has been acknowledged that the lower limit size of granular sludge was defined as 0 2 mm de kreuk et al 2007 based on the average size the granules of sludge bed could be divided into 5 groups floc 200 μm fine granule 200 600 μm medium granule 600 1000 μm coarse granule 1000 2000 μm and extra coarse granule 2000 μm in the present anammox system the sludge bed mainly consisted of granules 200 μm which accounted for 96 9 of all the sludge among the granules the extra coarse coarse medium and fine granules accounted for 40 8 34 0 11 2 and 10 9 respectively the size distribution was demonstrated to have a significant difference along the sludge bed height vmd was used to represent the average granule size it declined from 2135 μm 10 cm to 1802 μm 30 60 cm and then to 1569 μm 80 90 cm with the increase of sludge bed height if the maximum value of granules size at the bottom 10 cm was set as 100 the relative value at different heights was 83 30 cm 89 40 cm 85 50 cm 80 60 cm 78 80 cm and 69 90 cm respectively table 1 the granule gradation granules size distribution had a significant difference along the sludge bed height in the bottom section of sludge bed 0 10 cm the dominant component was the extra coarse granules with the proportion of 62 2 in the middle section 30 60 cm the dominant component was the extra coarse and coarse granules with the proportion from 86 8 to 80 7 in the top section 80 90 cm the dominant component was the extra coarse and coarse granules with the total proportion of 57 1 fig 4 a the overall granule size of sludge bed spanned the large range from 139 μm to 4108 μm coefficient of variation cv was used to describe the dispersion degree barth et al 1984 the bottom section middle section and top section of sludge bed had the cv of 0 42 0 46 0 50 and 0 70 0 83 respectively the results indicated that the granules size distribution at the bottom was more concentrated than that at the top fig 4b 3 4 density of anammox granules the granule density was measured and the results showed that the granule density was stratified obviously along the sludge bed height in general the granule density gradually declined with the increase of sludge bed height from bottom to top in the bottom section 10 20 cm the granule density was 1 0219 g cm3 in the middle section 30 60 cm the granule density gradually transited from 1 0219 g cm3 to 1 0139 g cm3 in the top section 70 80 cm the granule density stayed at 1 0139 g cm3 fig 5 3 5 voidage of anammox sludge bed the voidage of anammox sludge bed at different heights was determined it referred to the fraction of the bed volume that is occupied by the voids and could reflected the spaces between the granules in per unit volume granule number density the lower the sludge bed voidage ε the more volume occupied by granules and the shorter the spaces between the granules in general the granule number density gradually declined with the increase of sludge bed height from bottom to top in the bottom section 10 20 cm the average ε was as low as 0 27 in the middle section 30 60 cm the average ε stayed at 0 31 in the top section 70 80 cm the average ε was up to 0 42 table 2 3 6 visual characterization of anammox sludge bed in order to characterize sludge bed texture intuitively the visual optics method was explored by using the lightness intensity of reflected light of sludge bed the texture of anammox sludge bed was mainly dependent on the granule gradation granules size distribution and granule number density spaces between granules which together conferred the visual feature of sludge bed therefore the lightness l was firstly demonstrated to have an excellent negative linear correlation with the average granules size d l 0 002d 26 689 r2 0 973 fig 6 a and the sludge bed voidage ε l 10 072ε 22 632 r2 0 991 separately fig 6b then the lightness of anammox sludge bed at different heights was shown in fig 6c in the middle section 30 70 cm the lightness l was shown to have a positive linear relationship with the bed height h l 0 161h 17 671 r2 0 945 it was consistent with the fact that vmd declined with the increase of bed height causing the increase of lightness l however in the bottom section 10 cm the lightness of anammox sludge bed deviated from the lower limit of fitting line obviously the extra coarse granules dominated in the bottom section with a small cv indicating a simple granule gradation in the top section 80 90 cm the lightness l deviated from the upper limit of fitting line obviously in the top section the fine granules and flocs dominated with a large cv indicating a complicate granule gradation with fine granules filling in the interspace between coarse granules 3 7 fluid pattern simulation of anammox reactor the fluid pattern in the reactor was simulated and the results showed that the floating bubbles generated by anammox granular sludge could arise the strong wake effect in the reaction zone of the reactor li et al 2013 in the center the flow line went up and the gas lifting velocity could achieve as high as 0 15 0 20 m s while in the outside the flow line went down with the estimated velocity of 0 07 0 15 m s fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 function of anammox sludge bed the overall activity of sludge bed is one of the biggest concerns for environmental engineers which could determine the process performance directly anaob are the core component of granules determining the specific anammox activity in essence as single celled organisms bacteria play their own individual roles as a member of microbial community and make their own contributions to the ecological function as a whole each granule harbors a particular microbial community and holds a particular metabolic capacity as an independent function unit the specific activities of granules are different from one another granules make up the sludge bed different assembles of granules can endow the sludge bed with different metabolic capacities except the existence of microorganism eps is also the key component of granules forming the granular architecture jia et al 2017 bacteria are immobilized in granules with the aid of eps and the different proportion of bacteria and eps could show up the specific morphology size and density of granules different assembles of granules can endow the sludge bed with different texture characteristics in this sense granules are not only the functional units of anammox sludge bed but also the structural units of sludge bed texture they could create a firm link between the texture of sludge bed and the reactor s performance blr is defined as substrate amount per biomass per time and is a good indicator for the famine and feast the more the substrate supply the more biomass it could support and the more eps would be secreted it has been reported that anaob are slow growing microorganism with the doubling time as long as 11 30 days van der star et al 2008 a long term operation is necessary to achieve the real steady state in this work the anammox reactor was run for over 15 months at the steady state even for the longest doubling time about 30 days the anaob had already gone through 15 generations therefore both the displayed anammox activity and texture of sludge bed were stable and credible the blr had a significant difference along the bed height p 0 05 with the increase of bed height the blr declined gradually from 384 7 mg n g vss d to 71 7 mg n g vss d table 2 pearson correlation analysis showed that both the vmd and density of granules had a significant correlation with the distribution of blr along the bed height p 0 01 table s1 it indicated a potential correlation between the sludge bed texture and anammox activity which needs further investigation with reactors at different nlrs 4 2 texture of anammox sludge bed the granules are the structural units of anammox sludge bed which make up the core component of anammox reactor the granule consists of solid phase e g bacteria and eps liquid phase e g solution and gas phase e g nitrogen gas the different proportions of three phases determine to some degree the size shape and density of granules different assembles of granules can compose the different patterns of sludge bed in the bioreactor granules take on their individual morphology as a structure unit and make their own contributions to the texture of sludge bed as a whole including granule gradation granules size distribution and granule number density spaces between granules based on the granule gradation the type of sludge can be classified as the floc sludge and the granule sludge the granule sludge can be further classified as the fine granule coarse granule and extra coarse granule according to the size in this work the granule gradation of bottom section was simple dominating with extra coarse granules according to vmd the texture of bottom section could be affiliated into the extra coarse granule bed the granule gradation of middle section was complicated poly dominating with medium coarse and extra coarse granules while the counterpart of top section was even more complicated poly dominating with even more granule components according to vmd the texture of middle section and top section could both be affiliated into the coarse granule bed in addition to the granule gradation the sludge bed texture also depends on the granule number density spaces between granules which is tied with the upflow velocity and the granule settling velocity in this work the upflow velocity of empty bed was set as 4 4 m h because the reaction zone was filled with different granules at different heights the sludge bed voidage was different along the height causing the different actual upflow velocity in the bottom middle and top section the sludge bed voidage was 0 27 0 31 and 0 42 resulting in the upflow velocity of 15 9 14 0 and 10 2 m h table 2 the different upflow velocity along the sludge bed serving as the selective pressure created different distribution of granule size and density 4 3 visual characterization of anammox sludge bed the lightness l value was found to be closely related with the intensity of reflected light from sludge bed the larger the interspace between granules was in the sludge bed the less light was reflected and the lower l value could be obtained the texture of the real sludge bed was a complex phenomenon combining both the difference of granule gradation and number density the lightness l was firstly demonstrated to have an excellent negative linear correlation with both the average granule size and the bed voidage separately the larger the granule size the more interspace exists between granules and the lower l could be get similarly the larger the voidage of sludge bed the lower the granule number density and the longer the space between granules causing the lower l value in fact both the granule gradation and number density changed along the sludge bed height and the lightness had a good correlation with the sludge bed height in the middle section which was in accord with the granule size decrease from the bottom to the top of sludge bed 4 4 formation mechanism of anammox sludge bed texture the upflow velocity of empty bed was 4 4 m h which was similar to the settling velocity of sludge bed fig s1 and it was higher than the critical value of 1 62 m h chen et al 2010 for the sludge bed expansion however even in the bottom section with the least voidage the upflow velocity was only 15 9 m h which was far lower than the granule settling velocity of 55 68 m h so the granules could settle down and keep in touch the mlvss of sludge bed was up to 16 80 1 44 g l with the expansion ratio of 1 25 fig s1 the granules could not migrate freely in the sludge bed therefore the upflow velocity of influent even including the recycle flow was still not high enough to loosen the sludge bed for the migration of granules the substrate ammonium and nitrite was absorbed into the anammox granular sludge then transformed into nitrogen gas finally released from the sludge bed the yield coefficient was 1 632 l n2 g nh4 n on one hand the small bubbles merged into large bubbles along the sludge bed height with the increase of bubble size the buoyancy became greater and the floating velocity of bubbles was sped up on the other hand as the bubbles rose from bottom to top the hydrostatic pressure decreased along the height and the floating velocity of bubbles also sped up the bubble floatation could form the strong wake effect it was reported that one volume of gas could carry 14 vol of mixed liquor bolle et al 1986 the wake effect of bubbles would cause a periodic rise and fall of the mixed liquid estimated by simulation the relative fluid velocity from the wake effect of bubbles was up to 0 1 0 2 m s 360 720 m h which was higher enough to drive the granules migration the fluid velocity lifted by the wake effect of bubbles could be the main driving force causing the segregation of granules in the sludge bed the granules segregation process could be divided into four phases fig 7 phase i fluid lifting the sludge bed is lifted by the wake effect of floating bubbles produced by anaob the movement of granules is accelerated causing the segregation of granules in the sludge bed the initial acceleration depends primarily upon the granule density rather than the granule size the high upflow velocity allows granules to migrate vertically based on their physical properties density size and morphology the sludge bed becomes looser and the granules begin to segregate based on the density phase ii fluid transition after the bubbles escape from the gas liquid surface the wake effect of floating bubbles disappears however the granules continue to move upwards by virtue of the inertia the sludge bed becomes the loosest and the migration velocity of granules relative to fluid flow is the lowest which promotes the segregation of granules based on the density the high density granules stop moving firstly due to the fluid resistance while the low density granules go on moving upwards and pass through the interspace between high density granules which enhances the stratification of sludge bed phase iii fluid sinking because of the gravity and the unbalanced pressure from the wake effect of floating bubbles the fluid and granules begin to go down together the sludge bed becomes compacter although the high density granules move upwards slowly they move downwards quickly the low density granules go in the opposite way because of the different settling velocity and the migration restriction of one granule by surrounding granules the space distribution of granules is fixed leading to the texture formation of sludge bed phase iv downflow stopping when the fluid stops sinking the granules continue to go back to the sludge bed the high density fine granules pass through the gaps between coarse granules and fill in the interspace interstitial trickling effect the sludge bed reaches a compact state and the segregation process of granules temporarily come to an end the periodic process for the rise and fall of fluid is called the jigging cycle wills and finch 2015 pita and castilho 2016 in one cycle the sludge bed goes from a compact state to a loose state and then returns to a compact state the granules go from an aggregation state to a segregation state and then return to an aggregation state relative to the bed height the migration of granules driven by the wake effect of floating bubbles was limited for one cycle so the stratification of sludge bed would be completed after the sludge bed goes through many jigging cycles at last the combination of gas driven segregation of granules and the density based aggregation of granules creates the distinctive space distribution of granules i e the unique texture of sludge bed which takes on the distinctive visual feature 5 conclusions 1 the anammox sludge bed was demonstrated to possess a unique texture composed of granule gradation granules size distribution and granule number density spaces between granules for the first time from bottom to top the average granule size was observed to decrease from 2135 μm to 1569 μm and the sludge bed voidage was observed to increase from 0 27 to 0 41 the texture characteristics were revealed to be closely related with the blr of sludge bed at different heights which could be a potential indicator for the process performance 2 the anammox sludge bed exhibited a distinctive visual feature which was the visualization of texture characteristics and could be characterized by the reflected light of sludge bed from bottom to top the lightness of bottom section middle section and top section was observed to increase from 17 28 to 19 43 the lightness l was revealed to have an excellent positive linear relationship with the sludge bed height h l 0 161h 17 671 r2 0 945 3 the anammox sludge bed had the wake effect of floating bubbles causing the periodic rise and fall of waterflow which was the main driving force of granules migration the complete formation of sludge bed texture depended on the periodic cycle of gas driven

18976,anammox granular sludge biotechnology has been successfully applied in the environmental engineering for nitrogen removal from wastewater however the startup and control of anammox process was difficult and lacks an easy recognized indicator in this work the texture of anammox sludge bed in a long term 15 months stable operated and high rate anammox reactor was investigated for the first time the results showed that the anammox sludge bed took on the unique texture which was closely related to the biological loading rates of sludge bed at different heights of the reactor the texture was ascribed to the pattern created by granule gradation granules size distribution and granule number density spaces between granules the sludge bed texture displayed the distinctive vision and could be characterized by the reflected light of sludge bed the lightness indicator was found to have an excellent linear relationship with the height of anammox sludge bed the texture of anammox sludge bed was revealed to originate from the periodic cycle of gas driven segregation and density based aggregation of granules the results hint at a convenient and efficient strategy for operators to assess and control the working state of anammox system graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox sludge bed texture composition lightness granules migration 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a biological process converting ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas via anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob kuenen et al 2008 kartal et al 2011 compared with conventional nitrification denitrification process anammox is demonstrated with obvious advantages such as no addition of organic compounds no requirement for aeration and high efficiency for nitrogen removal fux and siegrist 2004 making it a promising biotechnology for nitrogen removal kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 the first full scale anammox reactor in the world had been constructed in rotterdam netherlands in 2002 van der star et al 2007 nowadays more than 120 full scale anammox reactors have been put into use around the world ali and okabe 2015 anammox process has shown its broad application prospects in the biological wastewater treatment the biotechnology based on granular sludge is a promising alternative for the wastewater treatment and offers numerous operational and economic advantages over the conventional systems based on floccular sludge barr et al 2010 the granular sludge was firstly observed in the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor hulshoff pol et al 1983 lettinga et al 1983 and was also observed in the aerobic systems later dangcong et al 1999 adav et al 2008 franca et al 2017 recently the granular sludge properties have been critically reviewed winkler et al 2017 it has also been demonstrated that anaob are prone to granulation because of the high level extracellular polymeric substance eps and the strong hydrophobic surface relative to the activated sludge nitrifying sludge and denitrifying sludge ni et al 2010 hou et al 2015 ali et al 2018 the systems based on anammox granular sludge are often taken as preferred choice for nitrogen removal from wastewaters due to the good biomass retention and high volumetric loading rate abma et al 2007 tang et al 2017 in fact granular sludges are self immobilized microbial aggregates the microorganisms are capable of interacting and attaching to each other and aggregate to form the granules cooperatively the biodiversity and abundance of microbial community determine the specific function of granular sludge a granule harbors a particular microbial community and holds a particular metabolic capacity the granules make up the sludge bed which is responsible for the overall reactor s performance schmidt and ahring 1996 a granule is an independent structure unit of the reactor after the long term mutual interactions between granules nutrients and waterflow the granular sludges were sculptured and stabilized to show up specific morphological characteristics all the morphological properties of granular sludge e g color size shape and density are the reflection of microbial community and its physiological function kang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 the integrity and density of granular sludge determine the space distribution each granule is different from the other granules with the unique morphology properties accumulate to form the sludge bed and endow the overall sludge bed or sludge pile a distinctive and identifiable vision however the relationship between the morphology and the specific activity of granular sludge the integrated pattern of sludge bed and the reactor s performance still remains unclear and needs further research earlier research has shown that particle size and density induced segregation of granules occurred as a function of height over a settled sludge bed in the aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor sbr system according to the phenomenon a method for selective sludge removal was put forward to control the microbial community and in turn to optimize the reactor performance winkler et al 2011a 2011b however different from the aerobic system where granules were driven by extra aeration zhou et al 2016 the anammox granules could generate gas inside accumulate and finally release from the sludge bed so far there is no available information about the migration behavior of granules in the continuous anammox reactor and the visual feature of anammox sludge bed was unknown in the present work a long term stable operated 15 months and high rate anammox reactor was taken to investigate the sludge bed texture the objectives of this research were 1 to observe the reactor

of large volume proportion it was calculated according to the reference zhang et al 2018 each sample at different heights was run in triplicate 2 2 4 settling velocity the settling velocity of granular sludge was measured using a glass column which was 40 cm in height to ensure that the terminal settling velocity could be obtained and 10 0 cm in internal diameter to minimize the wall effect on granule settlement mu et al 2008 50 granules of each sample at different heights were randomly picked and the final settling velocity of each sample was obtained according to the statistic average value 2 3 voidage of sludge bed the sludge mixed liquor was withdrawn from different heights of sludge bed homogeneously the initial height was recorded as h0 after settling in a 100 ml volumetric cylinder for 30 min the height of sludge water interface was recorded as h and the voidage ε could be calculated by the equation ε 1 h h0 2 4 optical characterization of sludge bed the optical characterization of sludge bed was determined by a cm 5 spectrophotometer konica minolta japan spectrometry is currently the mainstream technology for color measurement the light emitted by the inside illuminant shines on the sample the reflected light enters the spectral dispersion system and then analyzed by the array sensor the final color value is obtained and represented in the color space l a b it includes both lightness l and color components a and b information l means the lightness and varies from 0 to 100 with the increase intensity of reflected light received in the test 30 mm petri dish measurement model and d65 illuminant were set the spectrophotometer was firstly calibrated using the purified water then the granular sludges at day 400 were put into the peri dish to guarantee that the bottom was fully covered after that the peri dish was filled with the blank water at last the peri dish was covered with a black hood to avoid the disturbance of surrounding lights after each measurement the dish was rotated 90 clockwise each sample was measured for 4 times from different directions to take the average kang et al 2018 2 5 chemical analysis the ammonium nitrite nitrate

results 3 1 performance of anammox system the anammox bioreactor was run at the steady state for more than 450 days 15 months and achieve stable and high rate performance as shown in fig 2 the influent ammonium nitrite and tn were 279 32 337 30 and 616 59 mg n l respectively the effluent ammonium nitrite nitrate and tn were determined as 2 11 3 36 3 24 5 40 60 8 6 7 and 66 2 9 9 mg n l respectively fig 2a the removal efficiency of ammonium and nitrite was 99 2 1 1 and 99 1 1 6 the removal efficiency of tn was 89 2 2 0 fig 2b close to 87 9 which was calculated according to eq 1

range for anaob strous et al 1997 from fig 2c the reaction molar ratio of δno2 δnh4 and δno 3 δnh4 were calculated as 1 22 0 09 and 0 22 0 04 respectively which were close to the values of 1 32 and 0 26 reported in previous literature strous et al 1998 3 2 morphology observation of anammox granules the morphology including the shape and size of anammox granular sludges taken from different heights of sludge bed were observed qualitatively and they showed a visible difference fig 3 the bottom of the reaction zone was set as 0 cm in the top section 80 cm most granules were fine with the size less than 1 mm the fine granules were loose without a definite shape they were semi transparent with a blurred boundary occasionally irregular extra coarse or coarse granules were observed fig 3a in the middle upper section 50 cm most granules were medium up to 1 mm or coarse up to 2 mm the medium granules were in the shape of short rod and they were also semi transparent but with a clear boundary the coarse granules were compact fig 3b in the middle lower section 30 cm most granules were coarse and near spherical some granules were extra coarse 2 mm fig 3c in the bottom section 10 cm most granules were extra coarse a few fine granules and flocs filled in the gaps between coarse granules fig 3d 3 3 size distribution of anammox granules the size distribution of anammox granular sludges taken from different heights of sludge bed were determined quantitatively it has been acknowledged that the lower limit size of granular sludge was defined as 0 2 mm de kreuk et al 2007 based on the average size the granules of sludge bed could be divided into 5 groups floc 200 μm fine granule 200 600 μm medium granule 600 1000 μm coarse granule 1000 2000 μm and extra coarse granule 2000 μm in the present anammox system the sludge bed mainly consisted of granules 200 μm which accounted for 96 9 of all the sludge among the granules the extra coarse coarse medium and fine granules accounted for 40 8 34 0 11 2 and 10 9 respectively the size distribution was demonstrated to have a significant difference along the sludge bed height vmd was used to represent the average granule size it declined from 2135 μm 10 cm to 1802 μm 30 60 cm and then to 1569 μm 80 90 cm with the increase of sludge bed height if the maximum value of granules size at the bottom 10 cm was set as 100 the relative value at different heights was 83 30 cm 89 40 cm 85 50 cm 80 60 cm 78 80 cm and 69 90 cm respectively table 1 the granule gradation granules size distribution had a significant difference along the sludge bed height in the bottom section of sludge bed 0 10 cm the dominant component was the extra coarse granules with the proportion of 62 2 in the middle section 30 60 cm the dominant component was the extra coarse and coarse granules with the proportion from 86 8 to 80 7 in the top section 80 90 cm the dominant component was the extra coarse and coarse granules with the total proportion of 57 1 fig 4 a the overall granule size of sludge bed spanned the large range from 139 μm to 4108 μm coefficient of variation cv was used to describe the dispersion degree barth et al 1984 the bottom section middle section and top section of sludge bed had the cv of 0 42 0 46 0 50 and 0 70 0 83 respectively the results indicated that the granules size distribution at the bottom was more concentrated than that at the top fig 4b 3 4 density of anammox granules the granule density was measured and the results showed that the granule density was stratified obviously along the sludge bed height in general the granule density gradually declined with the increase of sludge bed height from bottom to top in the bottom section 10 20 cm the granule density was 1 0219 g cm3 in the middle section 30 60 cm the granule density gradually transited from 1 0219 g cm3 to 1 0139 g cm3 in the top section 70 80 cm the granule density stayed at 1 0139 g cm3 fig 5 3 5 voidage of anammox sludge bed the voidage of anammox sludge bed at different heights was determined it referred to the fraction of the bed volume that is occupied by the voids and could reflected the spaces between the granules in per unit volume granule number density the lower the sludge bed voidage ε the more volume occupied by granules and the shorter the spaces between the granules in general the granule number density gradually declined with the increase of sludge bed height from bottom to top in the bottom section 10 20 cm the average ε was as low as 0 27 in the middle section 30 60 cm the average ε stayed at 0 31 in the top section 70 80 cm the average ε was up to 0 42 table 2 3 6 visual characterization of anammox sludge bed in order to characterize sludge bed texture intuitively the visual optics method was explored by using the lightness intensity of reflected light of sludge bed the texture of anammox sludge bed was mainly dependent on the granule gradation granules size distribution and granule number density spaces between granules which together conferred the visual feature of sludge bed therefore the lightness l was firstly demonstrated to have an excellent negative linear correlation with the average granules size d l 0 002d 26 689 r2 0 973 fig 6 a and the sludge bed voidage ε l 10 072ε 22 632 r2 0 991 separately fig 6b then the lightness of anammox sludge bed at different heights was shown in fig 6c in the middle section 30 70 cm the lightness l was shown to have a positive linear relationship with the bed height h l 0 161h 17 671 r2 0 945 it was consistent with the fact that vmd declined with the increase of bed height causing the increase of lightness l however in the bottom section 10 cm the lightness of anammox sludge bed deviated from the lower limit of fitting line obviously the extra coarse granules dominated in the bottom section with a small cv indicating a simple granule gradation in the top section 80 90 cm the lightness l deviated from the upper limit of fitting line obviously in the top section the fine granules and flocs dominated with a large cv indicating a complicate granule gradation with fine granules filling in the interspace between coarse granules 3 7 fluid pattern simulation of anammox reactor the fluid pattern in the reactor was simulated and the results showed that the floating bubbles generated by anammox granular sludge could arise the strong wake effect in the reaction zone of the reactor li et al 2013 in the center the flow line went up and the gas lifting velocity could achieve as high as 0 15 0 20 m s while in the outside the flow line went down with the estimated velocity of 0 07 0 15 m s fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 function of anammox sludge bed the overall activity of sludge bed is one of the biggest concerns for environmental engineers which could determine the process performance directly anaob are the core component of granules determining the specific anammox activity in essence as single celled organisms bacteria play their own individual roles as a member of microbial community and make their own contributions to the ecological function as a whole each granule harbors a particular microbial community and holds a particular metabolic capacity as an independent function unit the specific activities of granules are different from one another granules make up the sludge bed different assembles of granules can endow the sludge bed with different metabolic capacities except the existence of microorganism eps is also the key component of granules forming the granular architecture jia et al 2017 bacteria are immobilized in granules with the aid of eps and the different proportion of bacteria and eps could show up the specific morphology size and density of granules different assembles of granules can endow the sludge bed with different texture characteristics in this sense granules are not only the functional units of anammox sludge bed but also the structural units of sludge bed texture they could create a firm link between the texture of sludge bed and the reactor s performance blr is defined as substrate amount per biomass per time and is a good indicator for the famine and feast the more the substrate supply the more biomass it could support and the more eps would be secreted it has been reported that anaob are slow growing microorganism with the doubling time as long as 11 30 days van der star et al 2008 a long term operation is necessary to achieve the real steady state in this work the anammox reactor was run for over 15 months at the steady state even for the longest doubling time about 30 days the anaob had already gone through 15 generations therefore both the displayed anammox activity and texture of sludge bed were stable and credible the blr had a significant difference along the bed height p 0 05 with the increase of bed height the blr declined gradually from 384 7 mg n g vss d to 71 7 mg n g vss d table 2 pearson correlation analysis showed that both the vmd and density of granules had a significant correlation with the distribution of blr along the bed height p 0 01 table s1 it indicated a potential correlation between the sludge bed texture and anammox activity which needs further investigation with reactors at different nlrs 4 2 texture of anammox sludge bed the granules are the structural units of anammox sludge bed which make up the core component of anammox reactor the granule consists of solid phase e g bacteria and eps liquid phase e g solution and gas phase e g nitrogen gas the different proportions of three phases determine to some degree the size shape and density of granules different assembles of granules can compose the different patterns of sludge bed in the bioreactor granules take on their individual morphology as a structure unit and make their own contributions to the texture of sludge bed as a whole including granule gradation granules size distribution and granule number density spaces between granules based on the granule gradation the type of sludge can be classified as the floc sludge and the granule sludge the granule sludge can be further classified as the fine granule coarse granule and extra coarse granule according to the size in this work the granule gradation of bottom section was simple dominating with extra coarse granules according to vmd the texture of bottom section could be affiliated into the extra coarse granule bed the granule gradation of middle section was complicated poly dominating with medium coarse and extra coarse granules while the counterpart of top section was even more complicated poly dominating with even more granule components according to vmd the texture of middle section and top section could both be affiliated into the coarse granule bed in addition to the granule gradation the sludge bed texture also depends on the granule number density spaces between granules which is tied with the upflow velocity and the granule settling velocity in this work the upflow velocity of empty bed was set as 4 4 m h because the reaction zone was filled with different granules at different heights the sludge bed voidage was different along the height causing the different actual upflow velocity in the bottom middle and top section the sludge bed voidage was 0 27 0 31 and 0 42 resulting in the upflow velocity of 15 9 14 0 and 10 2 m h table 2 the different upflow velocity along the sludge bed serving as the selective pressure created different distribution of granule size and density 4 3 visual characterization of anammox sludge bed the lightness l value was found to be closely related with the intensity of reflected light from sludge bed the larger the interspace between granules was in the sludge bed the less light was reflected and the lower l value could be obtained the texture of the real sludge bed was a complex phenomenon combining both the difference of granule gradation and number density the lightness l was firstly demonstrated to have an excellent negative linear correlation with both the average granule size and the bed voidage separately the larger the granule size the more interspace exists between granules and the lower l could be get similarly the larger the voidage of sludge bed the lower the granule number density and the longer the space between granules causing the lower l value in fact both the granule gradation and number density changed along the sludge bed height and the lightness had a good correlation with the sludge bed height in the middle section which was in accord with the granule size decrease from the bottom to the top of sludge bed 4 4 formation mechanism of anammox sludge bed texture the upflow velocity of empty bed was 4 4 m h which was similar to the settling velocity of sludge bed fig s1 and it was higher than the critical value of 1 62 m h chen et al 2010 for the sludge bed expansion however even in the bottom section with the least voidage the upflow velocity was only 15 9 m h which was far lower than the granule settling velocity of 55 68 m h so the granules could settle down and keep in touch the mlvss of sludge bed was up to 16 80 1 44 g l with the expansion ratio of 1 25 fig s1 the granules could not migrate freely in the sludge bed therefore the upflow velocity of influent even including the recycle flow was still not high enough to loosen the sludge bed for the migration of granules the substrate ammonium and nitrite was absorbed into the anammox granular sludge then transformed into nitrogen gas finally released from the sludge bed the yield coefficient was 1 632 l n2 g nh4 n on one hand the small bubbles merged into large bubbles along the sludge bed height with the increase of bubble size the buoyancy became greater and the floating velocity of bubbles was sped up on the other hand as the bubbles rose from bottom to top the hydrostatic pressure decreased along the height and the floating velocity of bubbles also sped up the bubble floatation could form the strong wake effect it was reported that one volume of gas could carry 14 vol of mixed liquor bolle et al 1986 the wake effect of bubbles would cause a periodic rise and fall of the mixed liquid estimated by simulation the relative fluid velocity from the wake effect of bubbles was up to 0 1 0 2 m s 360 720 m h which was higher enough to drive the granules migration the fluid velocity lifted by the wake effect of bubbles could be the main driving force causing the segregation of granules in the sludge bed the granules segregation process could be divided into four phases fig 7 phase i fluid lifting the sludge bed is lifted by the wake effect of floating bubbles produced by anaob the movement of granules is accelerated causing the segregation of granules in the sludge bed the initial acceleration depends primarily upon the granule density rather than the granule size the high upflow velocity allows granules to migrate vertically based on their physical properties density size and morphology the sludge bed becomes looser and the granules begin to segregate based on the density phase ii fluid transition after the bubbles escape from the gas liquid surface the wake effect of floating bubbles disappears however the granules continue to move upwards by virtue of the inertia the sludge bed becomes the loosest and the migration velocity of granules relative to fluid flow is the lowest which promotes the segregation of granules based on the density the high density granules stop moving firstly due to the fluid resistance while the low density granules go on moving upwards and pass through the interspace between high density granules which enhances the stratification of sludge bed phase iii fluid sinking because of the gravity and the unbalanced pressure from the wake effect of floating bubbles the fluid and granules begin to go down together the sludge bed becomes compacter although the high density granules move upwards slowly they move downwards quickly the low density granules go in the opposite way because of the different settling velocity and the migration restriction of one granule by surrounding granules the space distribution of granules is fixed leading to the texture formation of sludge bed phase iv downflow stopping when the fluid stops sinking the granules continue to go back to the sludge bed the high density fine granules pass through the gaps between coarse granules and fill in the interspace interstitial trickling effect the sludge bed reaches a compact state and the segregation process of granules temporarily come to an end the periodic process for the rise and fall of fluid is called the jigging cycle wills and finch 2015 pita and castilho 2016 in one cycle the sludge bed goes from a compact state to a loose state and then returns to a compact state the granules go from an aggregation state to a segregation state and then return to an aggregation state relative to the bed height the migration of granules driven by the wake effect of floating bubbles was limited for one cycle so the stratification of sludge bed would be completed after the sludge bed goes through many jigging cycles at last the combination of gas driven segregation of granules and the density based aggregation of granules creates the distinctive space distribution of granules i e the unique texture of sludge bed which takes on the distinctive visual feature 5 conclusions 1 the anammox sludge bed was demonstrated to possess a unique texture composed of granule gradation granules size distribution and granule number density spaces between granules for the first time from bottom to top the average granule size was observed to decrease from 2135 μm to 1569 μm and the sludge bed voidage was observed to increase from 0 27 to 0 41 the texture characteristics were revealed to be closely related with the blr of sludge bed at different heights which could be a potential indicator for the process performance 2 the anammox sludge bed exhibited a distinctive visual feature which was the visualization of texture characteristics and could be characterized by the reflected light of sludge bed from bottom to top the lightness of bottom section middle section and top section was observed to increase from 17 28 to 19 43 the lightness l was revealed to have an excellent positive linear relationship with the sludge bed height h l 0 161h 17 671 r2 0 945 3 the anammox sludge bed had the wake effect of floating bubbles causing the periodic rise and fall of waterflow which was the main driving force of granules migration the complete formation of sludge bed texture depended on the periodic cycle of gas driven

18977,the granulation of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox biomass can play a key role in developing stable and high rate working of anammox process it is important to know the working mechanism of anammox granular sludge angs for the optimization of reactor performance in this study a lung like breathing determinator was invented to investigate the working behavior of angs in the bioreactor the results showed that the angs had a regular expansion and contraction phenomenon which was called lung like breathing with the biological loading rate blr at 0 114 kg n kg vss d the expansion and contraction amplitude exca was 1 29 0 05 and the expansion and contraction frequency excf was 39 3 1 6 times h the angs cultivated in a bioreactor with higher nitrogen removal rate nrr was found to have the higher exca and excf when determinated at the same blr and the lung like breathing behavior of one type of angs was revealed to bear a significantly p 0 05 positive correlation with the specific anammox activity saa the mass transfer flux from lung like breathing was far greater than that from molecular diffusion which was regarded as a vital mechanism for the angs to demonstrate its high activity these findings provided theoretical basis and technical parameters for the optimization of anammox nitrogen removal process graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox granular sludge lung like breathing expansion contraction amplitude expansion contraction frequency mass transfer flux 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a biological reaction with ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor and the nitrogen removal process based on this reaction is called anammox process kuenen et al 2008 jetten et al 2005 since the process has the advantages of no requirement for aeration high nitrogen loading rate nlr low operation cost and small excess sludge it was favored in the field of environmental engineering once it came out lotti et al 2012 in 2007 it was successfully put into full scale use for the removal of nitrogen from reject waters of anaerobic sludge digestion in rotterdam for the first time van der star et al 2007 and it attained a nlr as high as 9 5 kg n m3 d far higher than the traditional biologial nitrogen removal process of nitrification and denitrification 0 23 0 50 kg n m3 d gerardi 2002 so far more than 100 full scale anammox engineerings have come into being around the world which shows the broad prospects for the biotechnological development ali and okabe 2015 anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob are the core of anammox process jin et al 2008 in the anammox sludge bed reactor anaob and their associated bacteria mainly exist in the form of granular sludge and the nitrogen removal efficiency of reactor is positively correlated with the activity and amount of anammox granular sludge angs tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2018b it has been reported that the specific anammox activity saa of angs could reach up to 5 6 kg n kg vss d while the nlr and nrr nitrogen removal rate could achieve 76 7 kg n m3 d and 70 0 kg n m3 d in the lab scale reactors respectively relative to the performance of lab scale reactors there still existed vast promotion space for the full scale application tang et al 2011 2017 anaob live in the form of individual cell and the size is in micron scale in nature van niftrik et al 2008 hence the large specific surface area supports the efficient metabolism via the high rate mass transfer bosma et al 1996 however anaob tend to aggregate into granular sludge in the nitrogen removal system and the particle size is in millimeter scale which resulted in the relatively low specific surface area ali et al 2018 chen et al 2013 speth et al 2016 theoretically the decline of specific surface area of granules will severely limit mass tranfer and further affect the metabolism of anaob but it was noteworthy that the angs of high activity can hold up an inspiring nitrogen removal efficiency in the laboratory installations kartal et al 2010 tang et al 2017 why angs still has a good performance of mass transfer so far there is no relevant report recently the angs has been found in our laboratory to display the periodic expansion and contraction during the reaction process apparently this periodic expansion and contraction was much like the breathing behavior of human s lung therefore it is called the lung like breathing of angs lung breathing is a key part for the metabolism of human when the thest expands the air is breathed into lungs because the pressure in the lungs is lower than the atmosphere pressure and the oxygen of air passes through the trachea and bronchus and enters into the alveoli finally into blood while the carbon dioxide in the blood enters into lungs through alveoli when thest contracts the carbon dioxide is discharged from lungs because the pressure in the lungs is higher than the atmosphere pressure a high rate gas mass tranfer is achieved by the change of pressure during this process wang et al 2009 therefore the lung like breathing behavior of angs is speculated to relate with the mass transfer and metabolic activity of angs the aim of this study was to invent a determinator to detect the lung like breathing behavior of angs to reveal the mechanism of mass tranfer in angs and finally to establish the relationship of lung like breathing with the metabolic activity of angs and even the nitrogen removal efficeincy of anammox system 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox reaction system 2 1

anammox granular sludge the angs was taken from three anammox reactors r1 r2 and r3 which had all worked in steady states for over 150 days the three anammox reactors were operated in the up flow mode at 33 2 c the influent ph was controlled in the range of 7 2 7 5 and the hydraulic residence time hrt was controlled at 1 6 h ensuring the working conditions of three reactors were the same except for the influent substrate concentration the three types of angss taken from bottom of the three reactors were named sl sn and sh respectively 2 2 determination of lung like breathing behavior 2 2 1 lung

application method of lung like breathing determinator 1 determination of expansion and contraction amplitude exca angs was taken from the bottom of reactor and washed three times with the synthetic wastewater without ammonium and nitrite it was put in a biochemical incubator for about 2 h then a certain mass of angs was weighed and mixed with substrate of different concentrations next the mixture liquid was added into conial reaction bottle angs was layed on the bottom of the conial reaction bottle which was connected with the triangular joint grinding mouth both liquid and headspace of determinator were flushed with argon gas for 10 min to remove dissolved oxygen the height of mixture liquid surface in the capillary tube was adjusted to h0 by level regulator the liquid level rose to the highest value h1 after a period of reaction the expansion volume δva of angs was calculated by δha h1 h0 then the joint hose was sealed and the gas in the headspace of capillary tube was withdrawn to produce a negative pressure by pressure regulator to simulate the negative pressure at the inlet of riser pipe in the actual reactor the negative pressure was measured by the change of scale line the liquid level dropped to the lowest value h2 the volume of retained gas δvb was calculated by δhb h1 h2 and the contraction volume δvc of angs was calculated by δhc h0 h2 the expansion

anammox reactors were operated at a stable state for over 150 days r1 r2 and r3 represented the different nlrs of 5 03 0 34 kg n m3 d 10 18 0 44 kg n m3 d and 14 84 0 72 kg n m3 d respectively the performance of three reactors was shown in table 1 the nrr of r1 r2 and r3 were 4 92 0 37 kg n m3 d 10 11 0 46 kg n m3 d and 14 32 0 69 kg n m3 d respectively 3 2 lung like breathing behavior of angs

5n0 15 2 03h2o anammox is an incomplete nitrogen removal reaction as a certain amount of nitrate is remained strous et al 1999 and also a micro alkalization reaction which is necessary to concern the inhibition of alkalinity when treating high strength ammonuim contained wastewater tang et al 2009 with ammonium as the reference the change of major substance ratios in anammox was shown in fig 2 the consumption ratio of nitrite to ammonium was 1 35 0 16 mg mg which was slightly higher than the theoretical value 1 32 2 27 the ratio of nitrate production to ammonium consumption was 0 22 0 02 mg mg which was slightly lower than the theoretical value 0 26 15 38 and the ratio of dinitrogen gas production to ammonium consumption was 1 73 0 04 ml mg which was slightly lower than the theoretical value 1 81 4 32 respectively the output of n was 91 4 6 2 8 6 of the input when the n was balanced for the whole system indicating that the biological reaction parameters measured in the lung like breathing determinator basiclly matched the theoretical value of anammox and the similar results were also achieved for sl and sh table s1 3 2 2 exca and excf of angs the lung capacity and the breathing frequency are the key indexes of lung function therefore the lung like breathing behavior of angs was also described with the similar indexes exca and excf angs cultivated in r2 sn was taken as the experimental samples the change of mixture liquid surface in the capillary tube was observed after the angs was put into the determinator with the blr at 0 114 kg n kg vss d the height of mixture liquid surface in the capillary tube rose from 2 50 0 00 cm to 4 58 0 18 cm after reacting for about 1 h the expansion volume of granular sludge in the bioreactor was 65 2 5 6 mm3 and the expansion rate was 1 00 0 08 relative to the initial volume after operation of simulating negative pressure the height of mixture liquid surface in the capillary tube dropped to 1 90 0 07 cm the contraction volume of granular sludge in the bioreactor was 18 8 2 2 mm3 and the contraction rate was 0 29 0 03 relative to the initial volume the retained gas amount 84 0 3 3 mm3 and the retained gas rate 1 29 0 05 in the angs were calculated the retained gas amount was regarded as lung like capacity which could be represented by exca the excf of angs the number of gas turnover per unit time was regarded as lung like breathing frequency and it was calculated as 39 3 1 6 times h 3 3 lung like structure of angs to understand the lung like breathing behavior in deep the lung like structure of angs was further studied as was known angs was mainly composed of functional bacteria eps and pore jia et al 2017 the structure of angs could be divided into four levels single cell cell cluster subunit and granule from micro scale to macro scale and the possible mechanism was as follows 1 anaob and other microorganism aggregated together to form cell clusters a few microns to dozens of microns 2 cell clusters formed subunits with the eps and filamentous bacteria as the bridge dozens of microns to a few hundred microns 3 finally the subunits were integrated into granule a few hundred microns to a few millimeters lu et al 2012 lin et al 2017 the pores of different sizes were widely distributed between cells cell clusters and subunits which became the trachea and bronchus of lung like structure and worked as tunnels for mass transfer as shown in fig 3 the tunnels existed throughout the surface to the interior to uptake substrate and release gas eps includes proteins polysaccharides and lipids binding the functional bacteria together as well as shaping the morophology of angs hou et al 2015 ni et al 2015 and cells worked as alveoli for conversion of substrate in order to understand why angs display the expansion and contration behavior during the reaction process the pores of angs were analyzed the pores could be divided into macro pore the diameter is greater than 1 mm in which gravity water can move freely capillary pore the diameter is 0 1 μm 1 mm which has capillary properties ultracapillary pore the diameter is less than 0 1 μm which is filled with bound water and is ineffective for mass transfer huang et al 2012 the results showed that 99 of the pores in angs were capillary pores and the rest was ultracapillary pores table s2 the capillary pores were filled with the capillary water resulting in capillary resistance pf for its surface tension the smaller pore diameter could bring out greater capillary resistance huang et al 2012 for sn according to the laplace equation the resistance of capillary pores in angs could reach up to 7 atm and the resistance of capillary pores with the most probability was about 0 7 atm the most probable size was 218 88 μm the huge capillary resistance made it difficult for the produced gas to be discharged smoothly thus contributing to the expansion of angs with the accumulated gas and angs contracted when the gas released for the internal pressure caused by gas broke the threshold pg can be up to 1 5 atm according to the ideal gas state equation this behavior caused by pore of angs was just like the expansion and contraction of lung therefore it could be concluded that the functional bacteria eps and pore formed the complete lung like structure 3 4 process of lung like breathing behavior the lung like breathing process of angs was described as fig 4 when an analogy was made with the working process of lung the reactants of anammox were ammonium and nitrite while the main product was dinitrogen gas the solubility of dinitrogen gas was very low in water dilute solution phase 1 5 volume nitrogen can be dissolved in water per unit volume at 303 15 k 1 atm rumble et al 2018 which is easy to form bubbles in the water in the anammox system the substrate first entered the angs from the liquid phase by means of molecular diffusion van hulle et al 2010 and was then converted to dinitrogen gas in general the angs settled in the water phase under the hydrostatic pressure p1 hydrostatic pressure at the bottom can be up to 3 atm in the actual reactor at the height of 30 m the pores of angs were mainly filled with water while the dinitrogen gas produced by anaob was released out of cell to form bubbles the bubbles accumulated in angs when the dinitrogen gas release rate was faster than its diffusion rate which enhanced internal pressure the elevation of internal pressure would expand the volume of angs and raise the liquid level in the capillary tube the free water filled in the pores was extruded by the internal pressure called discharge of water at the same time resulting in the change of liquid pores to gas pores with the continuous gas production the positive pressure δp 0 δp pg p1 pf increased after the critical value was exceeded the bubbles were sprayed out from the angs and the interior was in negative pressure the liquid was sucked into angs called suction of water to complete an expansion contraction cycle in addition to the small cycle of discharge of water and suction of water a large lung like breathing cycle was also involved in the whole reactor the angs was under the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of reactor and the internal pressure was balanced with the external pressure with the continuous gas production in angs the granule density gradually decreased the angs would float upward under the action of rising fluid and buoyancy resulting in the decline of hydrostatic pressure which in turn promoted the discharge of water and gas release conversely after the release of gas the density of angs increased and angs sank back to the bottom from the top of reactor the hydrostatic pressure increased along the way which was helpful to suction of water and gas accumulation and thus completing a round of discharge of water and suction of water this was an expansion contraction cycle which took the whole reactor as the space for rising and falling figure s2 in this large cycle of lung like breathing the variation of external pressure can be up to 3 atm caused by hydrostatic pressure additionally the change of internal pressure resulted from the gas production was considerable therefore lung like breathing had a significant effect on the enhancement of mass transfer in angs by using the model presented in the supplementary information free diffusion mass transfer in angs and figure s3 enrieo et al 2003 mal et al 2003 xu et al 2000 q free diffusion mass transfer flux of sn was calculated less than 2 52 10 5 g n m2 s at the blr of 0 114 kg n kg vss d the diffusion coefficient of nh4 n and no2 n in water or dilute solutions were 1 98 10 9 m2 s and 1 94 10 9 m2 s at 303 15 k rumble et al 2018 the excf of angs in the lung like breathing determinator was set as f and the cycle time was set as 1 f so the mass transfer flux of surface diffusion per cycle was 2 31 10 3 g n m2 however according to actual gas production rate the mass transfer flux per cycle was 5 38 10 3 g n m2 which was far beyond free diffusion considering the porosity and tortuosity of angs obviously in addition to the free diffusion there existed other mass transfer in angs and the lung like breathing behavior was inferred as the main mechanism of high rate mass transfer on the other hand the lung like breathing behavior was existed in many kinds of biological treatment system such as uasb egsb and ic reactors so the discovery of lung like breathing provided a reasonable explanation for the excellent performance of anaerobic bioreactor particle density was an important indicator of angs to characterize its performance abma et al 2007 during the lung like breathing the pores in angs can be filled with gas the density of angs is minimal ρmin or liquid the density of angs is maximal ρmax under normal conditions the pores of angs are mainly occupied by liquid and the rest was occupied by gas so the density is between ρmin and ρmax as shown in fig 5 a the density range of angs during the lung like breathing process was determined by a pycnometer and the theoretical density range was also calculated by simplified lung like breathing model the relevant calculation formulas were shown in figure s4 it was found that the density range measured was consistent with the calculated value which meant the density range was indeed caused by water gas ratio in angs and the periodical variation of granular density provided another evidence for the existence of lung like breathing of angs 3 5 function of lung like breathing behavior 3 5 1 saa of angs the saa of angs reflects the ability to convert ammonium and nitrite in order to understand the relationship between the saa of angs and the lung like breathing behavior the lung like breathing behavior was studied at different blrs fig 5 for sn with the elevation of blr in determinator the exca of angs increased gradually with blr at 0 343 kg n kg vss d the exca reached the maximum of 1 84 0 14 then it decreased with the further elevation of blr fig 5a and the excf went up with the elevation of blr a little decline of excf was observed with the elevation of blr from 0 114 kg n kg vss d to 0 183 kg n kg vss d with blr at 0 457 kg n kg vss d the excf reached the maximum of 44 2 2 0 times h fig 5b the similar change trend occurred to sl and sh the saa of angs at different blrs was also measured and it was found to correlate significantly with the exca and excf of three types of angss p 0 05 table 2 the higher the saa of angs was the higher the exca and excf of angs were fig 6 a and b 3 5 2 nrr of anammox reactor as shown in fig 6a and b the exca and excf of sl sn and sh increased orderly at the same blrs the relationships of exca and excf with nrr of cultivated reactor were shown in fig 7 with the elevation of exca and excf the nrr increased accordingly from 4 92 0 37 kg n m3 d to 10 11 0 46 kg n m3 d and further to 14 32 0 69 kg n m3 d the linear fitting equations were nrr 25 38x1 23 34 r2 0 961 x1 referred to the exca at the blr of 0 114 kg n kg vss d and nrr 0 64x2 13 90 r2 0 840 x2 referred to the excf at the blr of 0 114 kg n kg vss d similarly it was found that the exca and excf of angs were larger when nrr was higher at other blrs fig 5 3 5 3 indication of lung like breathing the angs cultivated under the certain condition had the specific lung like structure such as community eps and pore porosity pore size number and volume of pores and the specific volume of granule thus forming the specific lung like function like the absorption the conversion rates of substrate and discharge of product for the same type of angs the metabolic capacity maximal specific reaction rate was stable when the metabolic activity saa of angs increased the dinitrogen gas production rate rose the mass transfer resistance resulted from nitrogen bubble increased leading to high internal pressure in angs therefore the expansion volume of angs was enlarged under higher saa similarly when the dinitrogen gas was released out of the angs the contraction volume of angs also became larger according to our observation the saa of angss was inhibited because of the high concentration of ammonium and nitrite at the blr of 0 457 kg n kg vss d thus leading to the decline of exca but the decline of gas turnover space exca was more than the decline of saa thus leading to the increase of excf similarly a little decline of excf was observed when the increase of gas turnover space was larger than the increase of saa as for excf number of dinitrogen gas turnover per unit time it would accelerate with the increase of saa when gas turnover space did not change so much hence for the same type of angs the lung like breathing behavior exca and excf could indicate the nitrogen removal efficiency saa of angs the cultivation of angs with different substrate concentrations can selectively enrich functional bacteria based on ks and blr lόpez et al 2008 therefore the lung like structure and lung like function were different for different angss as shown in figure s5 the morphology of angss in three anammox reactors was displayed the crevice on surface of sl sn and sh increased orderly because the crevice can serve as the mass transfer tunnels the crevice of sludge surface can become the entrance of mass transfer tunnels the larger entrance can help substrate ammonium and nitrite get into angs from the liquid phase more efficiently the higher nlr also led to a larger size of angs and a larger volume but less number of gas pocket and the angss cultivated at three different nlrs sl sn and sh presented different lung like breathing behaviors at the same blrs with the elevation of nlr nrr of anammox reactor increased as well as the exca and excf of angs as shown in table 3 the eps of sl sn and sh increased from 148 71 mg g vss to 216 47 mg g vss and further to 234 24 mg g vss the vmd volume weighed mean diameter of sl sn and sh increased orderly with the decline of porosity also the density and settling velocity of sl sn and sh increased orderly the capillary resistance of angs cultivated under the higher nlr condition was larger than that at the lower nlr because more eps was produced by anaob at the higher nlr which blocked more pores and resulted in higher density faster settling velocity and less porosity chen et al 2014 the larger mass transfer resistance led to the higher internal pressure in angs and the larger expansion volume of angs similarly when the dinitrogen gas was released out of angs the contraction volume of angs also became larger meanwhile the saa of sl sn and sh increased at the same blrs which meant the elevation of substrate conversion rate i e the larger number of substrate or dinitrogen gas turnover per unit time excf therefore the lung like breathing behavior exca and excf could indicate the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox reactor it is worth mentioning that the floatation of angs is often observed in the granule based anammox reactors especially at the high nitrogen loading rate with high saa and nrr chen et al 2010 2014 lu et al 2013 song et al 2017 the reason was that the excessive production of eps occupied the lung like breathing tunnels and in turn caused the accumulation of dinitrogen gas bubbles in angs leading to the floatation of angs due to the decline of density 4 conclusion the angs was revealed to display the lung like breathing behavior by the invented determinator the exca and excf of sn were 1 29 0 05 and 39 3 1 6 times h at the blr of 0 114 kg n kg vss d the lung like breathing behavior exca and excf of one type of angs differed at different blrs and different types of angss were found to have different lung like structures and lung like breathing behaviors at the same blrs the lung like breathing behavior was a vital mechanism for internal mass transfer of angs and it was also considered to be an effective indicator for the saa of angs and the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox system conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this

18977,the granulation of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox biomass can play a key role in developing stable and high rate working of anammox process it is important to know the working mechanism of anammox granular sludge angs for the optimization of reactor performance in this study a lung like breathing determinator was invented to investigate the working behavior of angs in the bioreactor the results showed that the angs had a regular expansion and contraction phenomenon which was called lung like breathing with the biological loading rate blr at 0 114 kg n kg vss d the expansion and contraction amplitude exca was 1 29 0 05 and the expansion and contraction frequency excf was 39 3 1 6 times h the angs cultivated in a bioreactor with higher nitrogen removal rate nrr was found to have the higher exca and excf when determinated at the same blr and the lung like breathing behavior of one type of angs was revealed to bear a significantly p 0 05 positive correlation with the specific anammox activity saa the mass transfer flux from lung like breathing was far greater than that from molecular diffusion which was regarded as a vital mechanism for the angs to demonstrate its high activity these findings provided theoretical basis and technical parameters for the optimization of anammox nitrogen removal process graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox granular sludge lung like breathing expansion contraction amplitude expansion contraction frequency mass transfer flux 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a biological reaction with ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor and the nitrogen removal process based on this reaction is called anammox process kuenen et al 2008 jetten et al 2005 since the process has the advantages of no requirement for aeration high nitrogen loading rate nlr low operation cost and small excess sludge it was favored in the field of environmental engineering once it came out lotti et al 2012 in 2007 it was successfully put into full scale use for the removal of nitrogen from reject waters of anaerobic sludge digestion in rotterdam for the first time van der star et al 2007 and it attained a nlr as high as 9 5 kg n m3 d far higher than the traditional biologial nitrogen removal process of nitrification and denitrification 0 23 0 50 kg n m3 d gerardi 2002 so far more than 100 full scale anammox engineerings have come into being around the world which shows the broad prospects for the biotechnological development ali and okabe 2015 anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob are the core of anammox process jin et al 2008 in the anammox sludge bed reactor anaob and their associated bacteria mainly exist in the form of granular sludge and the nitrogen removal efficiency of reactor is positively correlated with the activity and amount of anammox granular sludge angs tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2018b it has been reported that the specific anammox activity saa of angs could reach up to 5 6 kg n kg vss d while the nlr and nrr nitrogen removal rate could achieve 76 7 kg n m3 d and 70 0 kg n m3 d in the lab scale reactors respectively relative to the performance of lab scale reactors there still existed vast promotion space for the full scale application tang et al 2011 2017 anaob live in the form of individual cell and the size is in micron scale in nature van niftrik et al 2008 hence the large specific surface area supports the efficient metabolism via the high rate mass transfer bosma et al 1996 however anaob tend to aggregate into granular sludge in the nitrogen removal system and the particle size is in millimeter scale which resulted in the relatively low specific surface area ali et al 2018 chen et al 2013 speth et al 2016 theoretically the decline of specific surface area of granules will severely limit mass tranfer and further affect the metabolism of anaob but it was noteworthy that the angs of high activity can hold up an inspiring nitrogen removal efficiency in the laboratory installations kartal et al 2010 tang et al 2017 why angs still has a good performance of mass transfer so far there is no relevant report recently the angs has been found in our laboratory to display the periodic expansion and contraction during the reaction process apparently this periodic expansion and contraction was much like the breathing behavior of human s lung therefore it is called the lung like breathing of angs lung breathing is a key part for the metabolism of human when the thest expands the air is breathed into lungs because the pressure in the lungs is lower than the atmosphere pressure and the oxygen of air passes through the trachea and bronchus and enters into the alveoli finally into blood while the carbon dioxide in the blood enters into lungs through alveoli when thest contracts the carbon dioxide is discharged from lungs because the pressure in the lungs is higher than the atmosphere pressure a high rate gas mass tranfer is achieved by the change of pressure during this process wang et al 2009 therefore the lung like breathing behavior of angs is speculated to relate with the mass transfer and metabolic activity of angs the aim of this study was to invent a determinator to detect the lung like breathing behavior of angs to reveal the mechanism of mass tranfer in angs and finally to establish the relationship of lung like breathing with the metabolic activity of angs and even the nitrogen removal efficeincy of anammox system 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox reaction system 2 1

anammox granular sludge the angs was taken from three anammox reactors r1 r2 and r3 which had all worked in steady states for over 150 days the three anammox reactors were operated in the up flow mode

mixture liquid was added into conial reaction bottle angs was layed on the bottom of the conial reaction bottle which was connected with the triangular joint grinding mouth both liquid and headspace of determinator were flushed with argon gas for 10 min to remove dissolved oxygen the height of mixture liquid surface in the capillary tube was adjusted to h0 by level regulator the liquid level rose to the highest value h1 after a period of reaction the expansion volume δva of angs was calculated by δha h1 h0 then the joint hose was sealed and the gas in the headspace of capillary tube was withdrawn to produce a negative pressure by pressure regulator to simulate the negative pressure at the inlet of riser pipe in the actual reactor the negative pressure was measured by the change of scale line the liquid level dropped to the lowest value h2 the volume of retained gas δvb was calculated by δhb h1 h2 and the contraction volume δvc of angs was calculated by δhc h0 h2 the expansion

breathing determinator basiclly matched the theoretical value of anammox and the similar results were also achieved for sl and sh table s1 3 2 2 exca and excf of angs the lung capacity and the breathing frequency are the key indexes of lung function therefore the lung like breathing behavior of angs was also described with the similar indexes exca and excf angs cultivated in r2 sn was taken as the experimental samples the change of mixture liquid surface in the capillary tube was observed after the angs was put into the determinator with the blr at 0 114 kg n kg vss d the height of mixture liquid surface in the capillary tube rose from 2 50 0 00 cm to 4 58 0 18 cm after reacting for about 1 h the expansion volume of granular sludge in the bioreactor was 65 2 5 6 mm3 and the expansion rate was 1 00 0 08 relative to the initial volume after operation of simulating negative pressure the height of mixture liquid surface in the capillary tube dropped to 1 90 0 07 cm the contraction volume of granular sludge in the bioreactor was 18 8 2 2 mm3 and the contraction rate was 0 29 0 03 relative to the initial volume the retained gas amount 84 0 3 3 mm3 and the retained gas rate 1 29 0 05 in the angs were calculated the retained gas amount was regarded as lung like capacity which could be represented by exca the excf of angs the number of gas turnover per unit time was regarded as lung like breathing frequency and it was calculated as 39 3 1 6 times h 3 3 lung like structure of angs to understand the lung like breathing behavior in deep the lung like structure of angs was further studied as was known angs was mainly composed of functional bacteria eps and pore jia et al 2017 the structure of angs could be divided into four levels single cell cell cluster subunit and granule from micro scale to macro scale and the possible mechanism was as follows 1 anaob and other microorganism aggregated together to form cell clusters a few microns to dozens of microns 2 cell clusters formed subunits with the eps and filamentous bacteria as the bridge dozens of microns to a few hundred microns 3 finally the subunits were integrated into granule a few hundred microns to a few millimeters lu et al 2012 lin et al 2017 the pores of different sizes were widely distributed between cells cell clusters and subunits which became the trachea and bronchus of lung like structure and worked as tunnels for mass transfer as shown in fig 3 the tunnels existed throughout the surface to the interior to uptake substrate and release gas eps includes proteins polysaccharides and lipids binding the functional bacteria together as well as shaping the morophology of angs hou et al 2015 ni et al 2015 and cells worked as alveoli for conversion of substrate in order to understand why angs display the expansion and contration behavior during the reaction process the pores of angs were analyzed the pores could be divided into macro pore the diameter is greater than 1 mm in which gravity water can move freely capillary pore the diameter is 0 1 μm 1 mm which has capillary properties ultracapillary pore the diameter is less than 0 1 μm which is filled with bound water and is ineffective for mass transfer huang et al 2012 the results showed that 99 of the pores in angs were capillary pores and the rest was ultracapillary pores table s2 the capillary pores were filled with the capillary water resulting in capillary resistance pf for its surface tension the smaller pore diameter could bring out greater capillary resistance huang et al 2012 for sn according to the laplace equation the resistance of capillary pores in angs could reach up to 7 atm and the resistance of capillary pores with the most probability was about 0 7 atm the most probable size was 218 88 μm the huge capillary resistance made it difficult for the produced gas to be discharged smoothly thus contributing to the expansion of angs with the accumulated gas and angs contracted when the gas released for the internal pressure caused by gas broke the threshold pg can be up to 1 5 atm according to the ideal gas state equation this behavior caused by pore of angs was just like the expansion and contraction of lung therefore it could be concluded that the functional bacteria eps and pore formed the complete lung like structure 3 4 process of lung like breathing behavior the lung like breathing process of angs was described as fig 4 when an analogy was made with the working process of lung the reactants of anammox were ammonium and nitrite while the main product was dinitrogen gas the solubility of dinitrogen gas was very low in water dilute solution phase 1 5 volume nitrogen can be dissolved in water per unit volume at 303 15 k 1 atm rumble et al 2018 which is easy to form bubbles in the water in the anammox system the substrate first entered the angs from the liquid phase by means of molecular diffusion van hulle et al 2010 and was then converted to dinitrogen gas in general the angs settled in the water phase under the hydrostatic pressure p1 hydrostatic pressure at the bottom can be up to 3 atm in the actual reactor at the height of 30 m the pores of angs were mainly filled with water while the dinitrogen gas produced by anaob was released out of cell to form bubbles the bubbles accumulated in angs when the dinitrogen gas release rate was faster than its diffusion rate which enhanced internal pressure the elevation of internal pressure would expand the volume of angs and raise the liquid level in the capillary tube the free water filled in the pores was extruded by the internal pressure called discharge of water at the same time resulting in the change of liquid pores to gas pores with the continuous gas production the positive pressure δp 0 δp pg p1 pf increased after the critical value was exceeded the bubbles were sprayed out from the angs and the interior was in negative pressure the liquid was sucked into angs called suction of water to complete an expansion contraction cycle in addition to the small cycle of discharge of water and suction of water a large lung like breathing cycle was also involved in the whole reactor the angs was under the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of reactor and the internal pressure was balanced with the external pressure with the continuous gas production in angs the granule density gradually decreased the angs would float upward under the action of rising fluid and buoyancy resulting in the decline of hydrostatic pressure which in turn promoted the discharge of water and gas release conversely after the release of gas the density of angs increased and angs sank back to the bottom from the top of reactor the hydrostatic pressure increased along the way which was helpful to suction of water and gas accumulation and thus completing a round of discharge of water and suction of water this was an expansion contraction cycle which took the whole reactor as the space for rising and falling figure s2 in this large cycle of lung like breathing the variation of external pressure can be up to 3 atm caused by hydrostatic pressure additionally the change of internal pressure resulted from the gas production was considerable therefore lung like breathing had a significant effect on the enhancement of mass transfer in angs by using the model presented in the supplementary information free diffusion mass transfer in angs and figure s3 enrieo et al 2003 mal et al 2003 xu et al 2000 q free diffusion mass transfer flux of sn was calculated less than 2 52 10 5 g n m2 s at the blr of 0 114 kg n kg vss d the diffusion coefficient of nh4 n and no2 n in water or dilute solutions were 1 98 10 9 m2 s and 1 94 10 9 m2 s at 303 15 k rumble et al 2018 the excf of angs in the lung like breathing determinator was set as f and the cycle time was set as 1 f so the mass transfer flux of surface diffusion per cycle was 2 31 10 3 g n m2 however according to actual gas production rate the mass transfer flux per cycle was 5 38 10 3 g n m2 which was far beyond free diffusion considering the porosity and tortuosity of angs obviously in addition to the free diffusion there existed other mass transfer in angs and the lung like breathing behavior was inferred as the main mechanism of high rate mass transfer on the other hand the lung like breathing behavior was existed in many kinds of biological treatment system such as uasb egsb and ic reactors so the discovery of lung like breathing provided a reasonable explanation for the excellent performance of anaerobic bioreactor particle density was an important indicator of angs to characterize its performance abma et al 2007 during the lung like breathing the pores in angs can be filled with gas the density of angs is minimal ρmin or liquid the density of angs is maximal ρmax under normal conditions the pores of angs are mainly occupied by liquid and the rest was occupied by gas so the density is between ρmin and ρmax as shown in fig 5 a the density range of angs during the lung like breathing process was determined by a pycnometer and the theoretical density range was also calculated by simplified lung like breathing model the relevant calculation formulas were shown in figure s4 it was found that the density range measured was consistent with the calculated value which meant the density range was indeed caused by water gas ratio in angs and the periodical variation of granular density provided another evidence for the existence of lung like breathing of angs 3 5 function of lung like breathing behavior 3 5 1 saa of angs the saa of angs reflects the ability to convert ammonium and nitrite in order to understand the relationship between the saa of angs and the lung like breathing behavior the lung like breathing behavior was studied at different blrs fig 5 for sn with the elevation of blr in determinator the exca of angs increased gradually with blr at 0 343 kg n kg vss d the exca reached the maximum of 1 84 0 14 then it decreased with the further elevation of blr fig 5a and the excf went up with the elevation of blr a little decline of excf was observed with the elevation of blr from 0 114 kg n kg vss d to 0 183 kg n kg vss d with blr at 0 457 kg n kg vss d the excf reached the maximum of 44 2 2 0 times h fig 5b the similar change trend occurred to sl and sh the saa of angs at different blrs was also measured and it was found to correlate significantly with the exca and excf of three types of angss p 0 05 table 2 the higher the saa of angs was the higher the exca and excf of angs were fig 6 a and b 3 5 2 nrr of anammox reactor as shown in fig 6a and b the exca and excf of sl sn and sh increased orderly at the same blrs the relationships of exca and excf with nrr of cultivated reactor were shown in fig 7 with the elevation of exca and excf the nrr increased accordingly from 4 92 0 37 kg n m3 d to 10 11 0 46 kg n m3 d and further to 14 32 0 69 kg n m3 d the linear fitting equations were nrr 25 38x1 23 34 r2 0 961 x1 referred to the exca at the blr of 0 114 kg n kg vss d and nrr 0 64x2 13 90 r2 0 840 x2 referred to the excf at the blr of 0 114 kg n kg vss d similarly it was found that the exca and excf of angs were larger when nrr was higher at other blrs fig 5 3 5 3 indication of lung like breathing the angs cultivated under the certain condition had the specific lung like structure such as community eps and pore porosity pore size number and volume of pores and the specific volume of granule thus forming the specific lung like function like the absorption the conversion rates of substrate and discharge of product for the same type of angs the metabolic capacity maximal specific reaction rate was stable when the metabolic activity saa of angs increased the dinitrogen gas production rate rose the mass transfer resistance resulted from nitrogen bubble increased leading to high internal pressure in angs therefore the expansion volume of angs was enlarged under higher saa similarly when the dinitrogen gas was released out of the angs the contraction volume of angs also became larger according to our observation the saa of angss was inhibited because of the high concentration of ammonium and nitrite at the blr of 0 457 kg n kg vss d thus leading to the decline of exca but the decline of gas turnover space exca was more than the decline of saa thus leading to the increase of excf similarly a little decline of excf was observed when the increase of gas turnover space was larger than the increase of saa as for excf number of dinitrogen gas turnover per unit time it would accelerate with the increase of saa when gas turnover space did not change so much hence for the same type of angs the lung like breathing behavior exca and excf could indicate the nitrogen removal efficiency saa of angs the cultivation of angs with different substrate concentrations can selectively enrich functional bacteria based on ks and blr lόpez et al 2008 therefore the lung like structure and lung like function were different for different angss as shown in figure s5 the morphology of angss in three anammox reactors was displayed the crevice on surface of sl sn and sh increased orderly because the crevice can serve as the mass transfer tunnels the crevice of sludge surface can become the entrance of mass transfer tunnels the larger entrance can help substrate ammonium and nitrite get into angs from the liquid phase more efficiently the higher nlr also led to a larger size of angs and a larger volume but less number of gas pocket and the angss cultivated at three different nlrs sl sn and sh presented different lung like breathing behaviors at the same blrs with the elevation of nlr nrr of anammox reactor increased as well as the exca and excf of angs as shown in table 3 the eps of sl sn and sh increased from 148 71 mg g vss to 216 47 mg g vss and further to 234 24 mg g vss the vmd volume weighed mean diameter of sl sn and sh increased orderly with the decline of porosity also the density and settling velocity of sl sn and sh increased orderly the capillary resistance of angs cultivated under the higher nlr condition was larger than that at the lower nlr because more eps was produced by anaob at the higher nlr which blocked more pores and resulted in higher density faster settling velocity and less porosity chen et al 2014 the larger mass transfer resistance led to the higher internal pressure in angs and the larger expansion volume of angs similarly when the dinitrogen gas was released out of angs the contraction volume of angs also became larger meanwhile the saa of sl sn and sh increased at the same blrs which meant the elevation of substrate conversion rate i e the larger number of substrate or dinitrogen gas turnover per unit time excf therefore the lung like breathing behavior exca and excf could indicate the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox reactor it is worth mentioning that the floatation of angs is often observed in the granule based anammox reactors especially at the high nitrogen loading rate with high saa and nrr chen et al 2010 2014 lu et al 2013 song et al 2017 the reason was that the excessive production of eps occupied the lung like breathing tunnels and in turn caused the accumulation of dinitrogen gas bubbles in angs leading to the floatation of angs due to the decline of density 4 conclusion the angs was revealed to display the lung like breathing behavior by the invented determinator the exca and excf of sn were 1 29 0 05 and 39 3 1 6 times h at the blr of 0 114 kg n kg vss d the lung like breathing behavior exca and excf of one type of angs differed at different blrs and different types of angss were found to have different lung like structures and lung like breathing behaviors at the same blrs the lung like breathing behavior was a vital mechanism for internal mass transfer of angs and it was also considered to be an effective indicator for the saa of angs and the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox system conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this

18978,the efficiency of the ultraviolet uv chlorine process strongly depends on uv wavelength because chlorine photolysis and its subsequent radical formation are highly wavelength dependent this study compared the degradation of humic acid ha during the uv chlorine process by low pressure mercury lamp lpuv 254 nm and ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led 275 and 310 nm the results indicated that ha degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the fluence based degradation rate constants k obs were significantly affected by uv wavelength and solution ph ha degradation decreased greatly with increasing solution ph during the uv chlorine process at 254 nm while the opposite trend was observed at 275 and 310 nm in the meantime k obs decreased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm at ph 7 0 the changes of chlorine molar absorption coefficients at different uv wavelengths resulted in the variation of chlorine photodecay rates k obs chlorine and the synergistic effects of k obs chlorine and chlorine quantum yields φchlorine affected ha reduction the formation of disinfection by products dbps during the uv chlorine process was also evaluated a significant

evans et al 2005 2006 because it has raised serious challenges to drinking water treatment natural organic matter nom is widespread in aqueous environment and humic acid ha is a major component of nom ike et al 2018 xia et al 2018 although ha itself does not pose a risk to public health the presence of ha in water can cause aesthetic problems such as undesirable taste color and odor herzsprung et al 2012 most importantly ha is credited as the major precursor of many toxic disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas during disinfection processes using either chlorine or chloramine beggs and summers 2011 xia et al 2017 therefore the transformation and degradation of ha during water treatment processes is of considerable concern continuous efforts have been made to remove ha from aqueous solutions before disinfection process including coagulation flocculation and filtration however these traditional processes have limited removal capacity approximately 35 at conventional ph and may lead to spontaneous flocculation problems in distribution systems so as to raise customer complaints chow et al 2009 qin et al 2006 in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops has been proposed to be effective for chemical oxidation of micropollutants oppenländer 2007 vogelpohl and kim 2004 among these aops there is growing interest in the uv chlorine aop because a uv chlorine co exposure environment occurs in a number of water treatment scenarios the combined use of uv and chlorine can also provide multiple disinfection barriers and maintain residual protection in drinking water distribution systems fang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 during the uv chlorine process free chlorine generates reactive species such as ho cl cl2 and o under uv irradiation gao et al 2017 jin et al 2011 watts and linden 2007 ho is a broad spectrum strong oxidant sharma et al 2012 while reactive chlorine species rcss including cl and cl2 are selective oxidants fang et al 2014 the diverse reactive species that coexist in the uv chlorine aop can complement each other and contribute to contaminant degradation fang et al 2014 uv light sources and solution phs are known to influence the efficiency of the uv chlorine process fang et al 2014 watts and linden 2007 the ph affects the dissociation of hocl ocl which determines the absorbance and the quantum yields of chlorine degradation that are wavelength dependent and thus the radical production generally ph control at acidic conditions gao et al 2017 or the combination with hydrodynamic cavitation badmus et al 2018 čehovin et al 2017 ciriminna et al 2016 is required for the uv chlorine aop to enhance micropollutant removal recently uv light emitting diodes uv leds have emerged as an alternative type uv source the advantages of uv leds over conventional mercury vapor lamps include diversity in wavelengths durable construction longer lifetime no warm up time and environmental friendliness without the risk of mercury leaching song et al 2016 moreover combined uv leds with different wavelengths have been proven to enhance contaminant degradation gao et al 2019 previous studies have characterized the degradation of ha by the reactive species generated in a uv chlorine system using low pressure mercury lamps lpuv at the wavelength 254 nm li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 however limited literature focused on facilitating the match of uv emission spectra with the absorbance and or quantum yield maxima of chlorine to enhance its photo reaction therefore it is meaningful to study the effect of uv light at different wavelengths on chlorine photodecay leading to different behaviors of ha transformation during the uv chlorine process in this study three different uv sources i e 254 275 and 310 nm were selected for investigating the degradation of ha during the uv chlorine process by measuring the removal rate of dissolved organic carbon doc and the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and the variation of fluorescence intensity in sample solutions the kinetics of free chlorine photolysis were also studied on the other hand the formation of dbps during the uv chlorine process at different uv wavelengths was evaluated key parameters including uv fluence solution ph and bromide concentration on dbp formation were systematically studied for different uv wavelengths based on the information of detected dbps the theoretical cytotoxicity was also calculated and evaluated all the results from this work can be important knowledge for optimizing the operation of the uv chlorine process regarding uv wavelength for ha removal and control of dbp formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all chemicals were at least of acs or

added into 50 ml ha solutions with the initial concentration of doc at 3 0 mg c l the solution ph was adjusted at 5 0 9 0 using h2so4 or naoh in the presence of a 5 mm phosphate buffer uv irradiation experiments were then conducted using semi collimated beam apparatus as described in fig s1 of supplementary material a 11w philips low pressure mercury lamp emitting at 254 nm and uv leds emitting at

to evaluate the change of estimated toxicity at different uv fluence ph values and bromide concentrations the measured molar concentration of each dbp was divided by its corresponding lc50 value the lc50 values for all of the dbps were obtained from the same research group using the same cho assay muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2002 2010 plewa and wagner 2009 it was assumed that the toxicity of individual dbp was additive this approach has been applied to assess the toxic effect of detected dbps and their contribution to total dbp associated toxicity liu et al 2018 szczuka et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 wavelength dependency of ha degradation by the uv chlorine process 3 1 1 effect of uv fluence on ha degradation to clarify the degradation characteristics of ha as a result of the uv chlorine process changes in uv254 and doc of ha were investigated at ph 8 0 fig 1 the ph value was set as that measured for raw water chen et al 2017 golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 2002 during direct photolysis at the three selected uv wavelengths the insert figure in fig 1a limited changes in uv254 were observed the shorter uv wavelength is more efficient for uv254 removal the fluence based rate constants at 254 275 and 310 nm were 2 19 10 5 1 52 10 5 and 0 mj 1 cm2 respectively this dependency is mainly due to the influence of uv wavelength on the molar absorption coefficients of ha fig s2 nevertheless the rate of uv254 reduction increased significantly during the uv chlorine process to 74 5 87 3 and 60 9 at 254 275 and 310 nm respectively compared to that during chlorination alone dark control 18 3 at 1200 mj cm2 or direct photolysis 3 7 2 4 and 0 at 254 275 and 310 nm respectively at 1200 mj cm2 fig 1a this is ascribed to the formation of reactive radicals such as ho and rcss in the co exposure process li et al 2016 however it is interesting to note that the trend of ha degradation by the uv chlorine process at different wavelengths is different from that by direct photolysis uv254 removal reached the maximum at the wavelength of 275 nm and decreased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm during the uv chlorine process a similar pattern was observed for doc removal during the uv chlorine process 41 3 54 9 and 27 8 at 254 275 and 310 nm respectively at 1200 mj cm2 although doc removal was negligible by uv irradiation at the three wavelengths or by chlorination alone fig 1b also the superiority of 275 nm at ph 8 0 was confirmed by the eem contour plots for ha after uv chlorine treatment fluorescence intensity increased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm fig s3 it is speculated that the observed reduction trend of uv254 doc and fluorescence intensity at the three uv wavelengths by the uv chlorine process arises from two aspects first the light absorption of free chlorine contributed to the degradation of uv254 doc and fluorescence intensity based on the grotthuss draper law turro 1965 yin et al 2018 fig s4 displays the molar absorbance spectra of ocl and hocl with increasing uv wavelength from 254 to 310 nm the molar absorption coefficients of ocl and hocl exhibit different trends second the quantum yields of ocl and hocl are wavelength dependent yin et al 2018 the synergistic effects of molar absorbance and quantum yields resulted in the maximum removal of uv254 doc and fluorescence intensity at the wavelength of 275 nm at ph 8 0 the explanation will be discussed in detail in section 3 2 3 1 2 effect of ph on ha degradation fig 2 displays the total fluence based rate constants k obs for the uv chlorine process at the three uv wavelengths and ph values of 5 0 9 0 the reactions followed pseudo first order kinetics well r2 0 99 in fig 2a the k obs of uv254 removal at 254 nm and ph 5 0 1 62 10 3 mj 1 cm2 decreased by 40 6 as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 on the contrary the values of k obs increased from 9 07 10 4 and 3 42 10 4 mj 1 cm2 to 1 72 10 3 and 1 09 10 3 mj 1 cm2 at 275 and 310 nm respectively in fig 2b the similar trend of k obs of doc removal at the three uv wavelengths was observed at ph 7 0 the k obs for both uv254 and doc at 275 nm are comparable to that at 254 nm however at ph 7 0 the k obs for both uv254 and doc at 275 nm are much higher than that at 254 nm p 0 05 table s3 as for the wavelength of 310 nm it is always less effective than that at 275 nm in all cases and is only more efficient for ha degradation measured by uv254 than that at 254 nm at ph 9 0 these results indicate that the 275 nm uv led is more suitable and can be a promising alternative to the traditional uv mercury lamps 254 nm for ha degradation by the uv chlorine aop in raw water at ph 7 0 in order to further verify the specific behavior of uv chlorine system at the three uv wavelengths the k obs of uv photolysis k obs uv chlorination k obs chlorination and reactive radicals k obs radicals in ha degradation were calculated and displayed in fig 2a the total reaction rate constant k obs t was assumed to be the sum of the k obs uv k obs chlorination and k obs radicals eq 2 then the k obs radicals can be calculated by subtracting the k obs t by the contributions of k obs uv and k obs chlorination 2 ln ha ha 0 k obs t uv fluence k obs uv k obs chlorination k obs radicals uv fluence where ha and ha 0 represent the concentrations of ha at different reaction time and the beginning respectively k obs t is the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constant mj 1 cm2 k obs uv and k obs chlorination are the measured pseudo first order direct photolysis and chlorination rate constants mj 1 cm2 respectively k obs radicals is the pseudo first order degradation rate constant mj 1 cm2 by reactive radicals uv photolysis and direct chlorination both played a minor role in ha removal measured by uv254 the k obs uv remained constant with increasing ph table s2 while the k obs chlorination increased with increasing ph from 5 0 to 8 0 and then decreased at ph 9 0 fig 2a the increase of k obs chlorination can be attributed to the structural conversion of ha from a coil form at acidic conditions to a linear structure in a alkaline environment rodríguez et al 2014 then the decrease at ph 9 0 is mainly due to the weak oxidation ability of ocl which is the dominant species under this circumstance meanwhile the contribution of reactive radicals k obs radicals varied with phs and the trends differed from each other at the three uv wavelengths which will be discussed in the following section 3 2 the variation of k obs of doc removal at the three uv wavelengths exhibited similar trends to that of k obs of uv254 removal except that no change of doc was observed during uv photolysis or chlorination alone fig 2b however the uv254 removal rates were much higher than the corresponding doc removal rates this phenomenon has been reported in a previous research proposing that uv254 was more suitable to represent high molecular aromatic organic matter that can rapidly react with radicals to produce low molecular matter with low uv absorbance phong and hur 2016 3 2 chlorine photodecay rates and their quantum yields to illustrate the different behaviors of ha degradation at the three uv wavelengths and different phs during the uv chlorine aop the fluence based rate constants of chlorine photodecay k obs chlorine were estimated with the results displayed in fig 3 a the results indicated that with increasing ph from 5 0 to 9 0 k obs chlorine decreased by 54 6 at 254 nm and increased by 48 7 and 42 7 at 275 and 310 nm respectively which were in good accordance with the trends in fig 2 this phenomenon could be attributed to the generation of radicals from chlorine photolysis during the uv chlorine process contributing to efficient degradation of ha fang et al 2014 yin et al 2018 moreover we anticipated that the absorption of uv photons by chlorine was responsible for the observed ph dependent photodecay rates according to the grotthuss draper law as displayed in fig 3b the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine at 254 nm decreased slightly while that increased significantly at 275 and 310 nm as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 the uv absorbance of chlorine was correlated with k obs chlorine at the three uv wavelengths supporting that the ph dependency of k obs chlorine is partially due to the ph dependent uv absorptivity this is consistent with other research reporting that the correlation between molar absorption coefficient and chlorine photodecay rate is a positive monotonic function yin et al 2018 on the other hand fig 3b displays the quantum yields of chlorine degradation φchlorine calculated according to eq 3 3 φ chlorine moles of free chlorine decomposed absorbed einsteins k obs chlorine e p s 1 10 al v chlorine where φchlorine represents the quantum yield of aquatic chlorine photolysis mol einstein k obs chlorine is the chlorine photolysis kinetic constant s 1 ep is the uv led irradiance on the surface of a sample einstein s 1 cm 2 s is the surface area of a sample exposed to uv light cm2 a is the absorbance of a sample at a specific wavelength cm 1 l is the effective path length cm v is the volume of a sample l chlorine is the concentration of free chlorine m the quantum yields decreased with increasing uv wavelength at ph 5 0 9 0 at acidic phs e g 7 0 the uv absorbance of aqueous chlorine at the three uv wavelengths decreased in the order of 254 nm 275 nm 310 nm which resulted in the decrease of k obs chlorine with increasing uv wavelengths the synergistic effects of chlorine photodecay rates and quantum yields thus affected the degradation rate constants of ha at ph 7 0 decreased in the order of 254 nm 275 nm 310 nm fig 2 however the absorptivity of chlorine at 275 nm was much higher than that at 254 nm at alkaline phs 7 0 under which circumstance the effect of quantum yields was negligible and thus the superiority at 275 nm over 254 nm in ha degradation was observed fig 2 besides according to the results of photodegradation alone the presence of ha also competed with chlorine for light absorbance so as to inhibit chlorine photolysis at 254 nm uv irradiation as for 310 nm although the uv absorbance of chlorine at ph 7 0 was as high as that at 275 nm fig 3b the inefficient degradation was observed fig 2 for its relatively low quantum yield 3 3 dbp formation during the uv chlorine process at different uv wavelengths 3 3 1 effect of uv fluence on dbp formation the formation of carbonaceous dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps during the uv chlorine aop with uv fluence of 100 1200 mj cm2 and chlorination dark control are presented in fig 4 c dbps including chloroform cf dichloropropanone dcp trichloropropanone tcp dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa and n dbp including dichloroacetonitrile dcan were detected among which thms and haas are regulated dbps and other unregulated dbps exhibit comparable genotoxicity even carcinogenicity and concentrations in drinking water bond et al 2015 richardson et al 2007 for all the processes the time dependent formation of dbps was observed less formation of each dbp species was observed during chlorination than during the uv chlorine process this is ascribed to the much larger chlorine consumptions in the uv chlorine aop compared to chlorination alone fig s5 radicals especially rcss generated from chlorine photolysis may enhance dbp formation through the interactions between rcss and dbp precursors at uv fluence of 100 and 200 mj cm2 the application of 275 nm produced the most abundant dbps followed by 254 nm 310 nm and direct chlorination fig 4a meanwhile from fig 3a the chlorine photodecay rate which could affect the concentrations of radicals such as rcss also had a maximum at 275 nm and ph 8 0 therefore more dbps can be formed by cl substitution and cl addition reactions with the faster production of rcss alegre et al 2000 however the total amount of dbps at 275 nm was lower than that at 254 nm at uv fluence higher than 500 mj cm2 this is probably because more dbp precursors were destructed during uv chlorination at higher uv fluence and 275 nm fig 1 and the formed dbps might also be attacked by reactive radicals although the lowest dbp yield was obtained at 310 nm when applying the uv chlorine aop in all cases the weak decomposition of ha should be taken into account when evaluating the uv chlorine treatment at different uv wavelengths these phenomena indicate that uv led at 275 nm has the potential to replace lpuv lamps for its better performance in dbp control at higher uv fluence e g 500 mj cm2 and ph 8 0 to further understand the effect of uv wavelength and fluence on the formation of individual dbps we analyzed the formation process of each dbp species as displayed in fig 4b f the concentrations of dcan tcp dcaa and tcaa increased with increasing exposure time during chlorination alone whereas dcp was suppressed under the same condition cf increased firstly and then decreased as reaction time went by during chlorination fig s6 notably the uv wavelength also exhibited obvious impact on the formation of specific dbps during co exposure process the yields of specific dbps achieved the highest at 275 nm and low uv fluence but peaked at 254 or 310 nm subsequently among the specific dbps the concentrations of cf dcan and tcp presented an increasing and then decreasing trend during the uv chlorine process figs s6 and 4b and4d while the increasing trends remained stable for other dbps dcp dcaa and tcaa at longer uv exposure fig 4c e and 4f these dbps were formed continuously from the reactions of rcss with ha nevertheless exorbitant ho can lead to the mineralization of dbp precursors and attack the produced dbps causing the reduction of some dbps as uv fluence increased von 2007 overall thm1 cf and haa2 dcaa and tcaa predominated among the detected dbps on a molar basis fig s7 in all cases when increasing exposure time the percentage of haa2 in the formed dbps was enhanced 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm direct chlorination and that of thm1 declined accordingly 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm direct chlorination this implies that increasing reaction time can sharply reduce the proportion of thm1 but not haa2 3 3 2 effect of ph on dbp formation fig 5 displays the formation of dbps during chlorination and the uv chlorine process at different ph values at low uv fluence 100 mj cm2 the yields of dbps increased as ph increased during chlorination alone except for ph 9 0 fig 5a which is consistent with the trend of uv254 degradation fig 2a as for uv chlorine oxidation at acidic conditions the total amount of dbps at 254 nm was the highest followed by 275 nm and 310 nm however at ph values higher than 7 0 the uv led 275 nm chlorine process produced the most abundant dbps this phenomenon could be explained by the different rates of chlorine photolysis at the three uv wavelengths fig 3a when uv fluence was up to 1200 mj cm2 abundant rcss were generated to react with precursors to produce more dbps compared to that at 100 mj cm2 uv fluence fig 5b however it should be mentioned that 275 nm uv light exhibited significant inhibition on dbp formation under alkaline conditions which might be due to the effective destruction of dbp precursors and the formed dbps at high uv fluence fig 1 and s3 therefore for the source water at alkaline conditions 275 nm uv led at high uv fluence can be a good choice to control dbp formation in uv chlorine treatment the dbp concentrations were confirmed to be dominated by thm1 and haa2 on a molar basis fig s8 at uv fluence of 100 mj cm2 thm1 and haa2 accounted for 15 1 46 5 and 48 9 76 2 respectively of the detected dbps and the contribution of haas increased with decreasing ph fig s8a this may be explained by the reaction mechanisms that base catalyzed hydrolysis yields more thms under alkaline conditions and more haas will be formed in acidic environments when the precursor donates an electron pair to the rest of the molecule liang and singer 2003 as uv fluence increased to 1200 mj cm2 fig s8b haa2 were still dominant but the significant suppression of the percentage of thm1 was achieved decreased to 3 6 21 3 3 3 3 the role of initial bromide concentration on the formation of dbps naturally occurring br in raw water could readily be incorporated into dbps in order to investigate the influence of br concentration on the formation of dbps different concentrations of br were spiked and the results are displayed in fig 6 the formation of brominated dbps br dbps increased but chlorinated dbps decreased as br concentration increased from 0 to 10 μm fig 6a this might be due to the formation of more hobr at higher br concentration that promoted the formation of br dbps hua et al 2006 kumar and margerum 1987 the total amount of dbps except bromate exhibited similar trends to the results in fig 5 that the yield of dbps reached the highest level at 275 nm at 100 mj cm2 uv fluence fig 5a whereas at 1200 mj cm2 the maximum dbp yield was achieved at 254 nm fig 5b however bromate accounted for 42 7 73 6 of the detected dbps on a molar basis during chlorination and the uv chlorine process and decreased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm direct chlorination fig 6a the results agreed with the observed rate constants of chlorine photodecay in fig 3a the reactive species formed during the uv chlorine process may enhance the formation of bromate by a series oxidation of br to hobr or obr and then to bromate von gunten 2003 due to the predominant bromate the yields of dbps reached a maximum at 275 nm 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm chlorination alone resulting in similar changes in buf fig 6b moreover in the absence of uv light chlorination converted 15 6 25 9 of br to bromate 9 8 22 3 to detected br dbps and 29 0 36 2 to unknown intermediate products respectively fig 6c in contrast in the presence of uv irradiation co exposure generated more bromate 20 3 60 0 and less unknown intermediates 20 0 33 7 this could be attributed to the powerful oxidizing ability of reactive species generated during the uv chlorine process which enhanced the conversion of br to bromate fang et al 2017 3 4 evaluation of theoretical cytotoxicity of detected dbps 3 4 1 effect of uv fluence on theoretical cytotoxicity fig 7 displays the calculated cytotoxicity of detected dbps which kept rising as reaction time went by during chlorination while the calculated toxicity increased first and then decreased during the uv chlorine aop at the three uv wavelengths these trends are consistent with the changes of dcan concentrations fig 4b because dcan was the major contributor to the calculated dbp associated toxicity fig s9 due to its low lc50 value muellner et al 2007 although thm1 and haa2 dominated in the detected dbps on a molar basis fig s7 with the increase of reaction time the application of chlorine alone would enhance the calculated toxicity resulting from the increasing contribution of dcan comparatively the calculated toxicity was relatively reduced 12 5 29 0 and 17 2 at 254 275 and 310 nm respectively at 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence by the uv chlorine process due to the effective mitigation of dcan formation at longer reaction time and the lowest value of calculated toxicity was observed at 275 nm fig 7 3 4 2 effect of ph on theoretical cytotoxicity the influence of ph on the calculated dbp associated toxicity is displayed in fig 8 at uv fluence of 100 mj cm2 the calculated toxicity reached a maximum at neutral ph then decreased somewhat afterward fig 8a this trend is consistent with the changes of dcan concentrations fig 5a because dcan exhibits considerably higher toxicity compared with other dbps table s1 constituting more than 46 1 of the total toxicity fig s10a in other words uv chlorine treatment significantly enhanced the calculated toxicity due to the promotion of dcan formation at higher uv fluence 1200 mj cm2 fig 8b it is worth noting that the calculated toxicity at alkaline conditions and 275 nm was remarkably lower than that during chlorination alone as well as 254 and 310 nm in fig s10b although haa2 constituted a very large proportion of the total toxicity 32 4 81 4 dcan still played a significant role in the calculated toxicity at higher uv fluence and alkaline conditions the uv wavelength of 275 nm can mitigate the formation of dcan effectively leading to the lowest calculated toxicity compared to that of 254 and 310 nm 3 4 3 effect of initial bromide concentration on theoretical cytotoxicity fig 9 presents the influence of initial br concentration on theoretical cytotoxicity of the detected dbps the calculated toxicity for all the four processes increased remarkably with the increase of br concentration this can be explained by the significantly enhanced formation of hans and haas especially their brominated species such as bcan dban and mbaa with the low lc50 values muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2010 which are major contributors 80 to the total toxicity however with increasing uv fluence from 100 to 1200 mj cm2 the application of 275 nm obviously minimized the calculated toxicity regardless of the br concentration during uv chlorination this is due to the effective mitigation of hans the above observations suggest that uv led with 275 nm may be selected for reducing the calculated toxicity in uv chlorine treatment furthermore the cytotoxicity calculated based on the detected dbps only provides us a convenient way to compare dbp associated toxicity experiments may be conducted to get a more comprehensive understanding about dbp mixture in future studies 4 conclusions this study compared the degradation efficiency of ha by the uv chlorine aop at three uv wavelengths 254 275 and 310 nm the degradation of uv254 and doc followed pseudo first order kinetics k obs decreased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm at ph 7 0 the removal rates of uv254 and doc were strongly dependent on uv wavelength and solution ph which could interfere with the chlorine photo chemistry ha degradation at 254 nm decreased with increasing ph whereas the uv chlorine aop at 275 and 310 nm presented remarkably efficient treatment efficiency at high solution phs these trends were also observed in chlorine photodecay rates at the three uv wavelengths the results imply that uv light at 275 nm is more suitable for ha reduction by the uv chlorine process and exhibits higher removal capacity than conventional treatments in real water ph of approximately 7 5 8 5 dbp formation and toxicity alteration during the uv chlorine process are also major concerns for practical applications the synergistic effect of uv and chlorine enhanced the formation of dbps due to the involvement of rcss as uv fluence increased from 100 to 1200 mj cm2 the yields of dbps kept increasing at the three uv wavelengths at relatively low uv fluence the yields of dbps decreased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm however at relatively high uv fluence the yields of dbps decreased in the order of 254 nm 275 nm 310 nm also lower yields of dbps can be obtained at 275 nm than 254 nm at longer reaction time regardless of the ph value however in the presence of br the uv chlorine aop produced much more abundant dbps due to the promotive oxidation of br to bromate notably the calculated toxicity of detected dbps could be reduced at 275 nm uv light at alkaline conditions and high uv fluence due to less formation of hans therefore uv led 275 nm is a promising alternative to the conventional uv mercury lamps 254 nm for ha degradation by the uv chlorine process with high uv fluence at neutral and alkaline phs considering the short transmittance of uv led light in water this new uv led chlorine process is targeted at new and existing small scale water treatment i e point of use applications and water supplies in rural areas however water matrix characteristics such as flow rate and alkalinity can greatly affect the efficiency of the uv led chlorine process therefore more detailed study should be performed prior to further recommendation of the practical applications in the field acknowledgments this study was financially supported

18978,the efficiency of the ultraviolet uv chlorine process strongly depends on uv wavelength because chlorine photolysis and its subsequent radical formation are highly wavelength dependent this study compared the degradation of humic acid ha during the uv chlorine process by low pressure mercury lamp lpuv 254 nm and ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led 275 and 310 nm the results indicated that ha degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the fluence based degradation rate constants k obs were significantly affected by uv wavelength and solution ph ha degradation decreased greatly with increasing solution ph during the uv chlorine process at 254 nm while the opposite trend was observed at 275 and 310 nm in the meantime k obs decreased in the order of 275 nm

brominated dbps 1 introduction water on the earth is undergoing pollution issues due to growing human activities major attention has been paid to increasing levels of organic carbon in freshwater evans et al 2005 2006 because it has raised serious challenges to drinking water treatment natural organic matter nom is widespread in aqueous environment and humic acid ha is a major component of nom ike et al 2018 xia et al 2018 although ha itself does not pose a risk to public health the presence of ha in water can cause aesthetic problems such as undesirable taste color and odor herzsprung et al 2012 most importantly ha is credited as the major precursor of many toxic disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas during disinfection processes using either chlorine or chloramine beggs and summers 2011 xia et al 2017 therefore the transformation and degradation of ha during water treatment processes is of considerable concern continuous efforts have been made to remove ha from aqueous solutions before disinfection process including coagulation flocculation and filtration however these traditional processes have limited removal capacity approximately 35 at conventional ph and may lead to spontaneous flocculation problems in distribution systems so as to raise customer complaints chow et al 2009 qin et al 2006 in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops has been proposed to be effective for chemical oxidation of micropollutants oppenländer 2007 vogelpohl and kim 2004 among these aops there is growing interest in the uv chlorine aop because a uv chlorine co exposure environment occurs in a number of water treatment scenarios the combined use of uv and chlorine can also provide multiple disinfection barriers and maintain residual protection in drinking water distribution systems fang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 during the uv chlorine process free chlorine generates reactive species such as ho cl cl2 and o under uv irradiation gao et al 2017 jin et al 2011 watts and linden 2007 ho is a broad spectrum strong oxidant sharma et al 2012 while reactive chlorine species rcss including cl and cl2 are selective oxidants fang et al 2014 the diverse reactive species that coexist in the uv chlorine aop can complement each other and contribute to contaminant degradation fang et al 2014 uv light sources and solution phs are known to influence the efficiency of the uv chlorine process fang et al 2014 watts and linden 2007 the ph affects the dissociation of hocl ocl which determines the absorbance and the quantum yields of chlorine degradation that are wavelength dependent and thus the radical production generally ph control at acidic conditions gao et al 2017 or the combination with hydrodynamic cavitation badmus et al 2018 čehovin et al 2017 ciriminna et al 2016 is required for the uv chlorine aop to enhance micropollutant removal recently uv light emitting diodes uv leds have emerged as an alternative type uv source the advantages of uv leds over conventional mercury vapor lamps include diversity in wavelengths durable construction longer lifetime no warm up time and environmental friendliness without the risk of mercury leaching song et al 2016 moreover combined uv leds with different wavelengths have been proven to enhance contaminant degradation gao et al 2019 previous studies have characterized the degradation of ha by the reactive species generated in a uv chlorine system using low pressure mercury lamps lpuv at the wavelength 254 nm li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 however limited literature focused on facilitating the match of uv emission spectra with the absorbance and or quantum yield maxima of chlorine to enhance its photo reaction therefore it is meaningful to study the effect of uv light at different wavelengths on chlorine photodecay leading to different behaviors of ha transformation during the uv chlorine process in this study three different uv sources i e 254 275 and 310 nm were selected for investigating the degradation of ha during the uv chlorine process by measuring the removal rate of dissolved organic carbon doc and the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and the variation of fluorescence intensity in sample solutions the kinetics of free chlorine photolysis were also studied on the other hand the formation of dbps during the uv chlorine process at different uv wavelengths was evaluated key parameters including uv fluence solution ph and bromide concentration on dbp formation were systematically studied for different uv wavelengths based on the information of detected dbps the theoretical cytotoxicity was also calculated and evaluated all the results from this work can be important knowledge for optimizing the operation of the uv chlorine process regarding uv wavelength for ha removal and control of dbp formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all chemicals were at least of acs or

added into 50 ml ha solutions with the initial concentration of doc at 3 0 mg c l the solution ph was adjusted at 5 0 9 0 using h2so4 or naoh in the presence of a 5 mm phosphate buffer uv irradiation experiments were then conducted using semi collimated beam apparatus as described in fig s1 of supplementary material a 11w philips low pressure mercury lamp emitting at 254 nm and uv leds emitting at

lc50 values for all of the dbps were obtained from the same research group using the same cho assay muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2002 2010 plewa and wagner 2009 it was assumed that the toxicity of individual dbp was additive this approach has been applied to assess the toxic effect of detected dbps and their contribution to total dbp associated toxicity liu et al 2018 szczuka et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 wavelength dependency of ha degradation by the uv chlorine process 3 1 1 effect of uv fluence on ha degradation to clarify the degradation characteristics of ha as a result of the uv chlorine process changes in uv254 and doc of ha were investigated at ph 8 0 fig 1 the ph value was set as that measured for raw water chen et al 2017 golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 2002 during direct photolysis at the three selected uv wavelengths the insert figure in fig 1a limited changes in uv254 were observed the shorter uv wavelength is more efficient for uv254 removal the fluence based rate constants at 254 275 and 310 nm were 2 19 10 5 1 52 10 5 and 0 mj 1 cm2 respectively this dependency is mainly due to the influence of uv wavelength on the molar absorption coefficients of ha fig s2 nevertheless the rate of uv254 reduction increased significantly during the uv chlorine process to 74 5 87 3 and 60 9 at 254 275 and 310 nm respectively compared to that during chlorination alone dark control 18 3 at 1200 mj cm2 or direct photolysis 3 7 2 4 and 0 at 254 275 and 310 nm respectively at 1200 mj cm2 fig 1a this is ascribed to the formation of reactive radicals such as ho and rcss in the co exposure process li et al 2016 however it is interesting to note that the trend of ha degradation by the uv chlorine process at different wavelengths is different from that by direct photolysis uv254 removal reached the maximum at the wavelength of 275 nm and decreased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm during the uv chlorine process a similar pattern was observed for doc removal during the uv chlorine process 41 3 54 9 and 27 8 at 254 275 and 310 nm respectively at 1200 mj cm2 although doc removal was negligible by uv irradiation at the three wavelengths or by chlorination alone fig 1b also the superiority of 275 nm at ph 8 0 was confirmed by the eem contour plots for ha after uv chlorine treatment fluorescence intensity increased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm fig s3 it is speculated that the observed reduction trend of uv254 doc and fluorescence intensity at the three uv wavelengths by the uv chlorine process arises from two aspects first the light absorption of free chlorine contributed to the degradation of uv254 doc and fluorescence intensity based on the grotthuss draper law turro 1965 yin et al 2018 fig s4 displays the molar absorbance spectra of ocl and hocl with increasing uv wavelength from 254 to 310 nm the molar absorption coefficients of ocl and hocl exhibit different trends second the quantum yields of ocl and hocl are wavelength dependent yin et al 2018 the synergistic effects of molar absorbance and quantum yields resulted in the maximum removal of uv254 doc and fluorescence intensity at the wavelength of 275 nm at ph 8 0 the explanation will be discussed in detail in section 3 2 3 1 2 effect of ph on ha degradation fig 2 displays the total fluence based rate constants k obs for the uv chlorine process at the three uv wavelengths and ph values of 5 0 9 0 the reactions followed pseudo first order kinetics well r2 0 99 in fig 2a the k obs of uv254 removal at 254 nm and ph 5 0 1 62 10 3 mj 1 cm2 decreased by 40 6 as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 on the contrary the values of k obs increased from 9 07 10 4 and 3 42 10 4 mj 1 cm2 to 1 72 10 3 and 1 09 10 3 mj 1 cm2 at 275 and 310 nm respectively in fig 2b the similar trend of k obs of doc removal at the three uv wavelengths was observed at ph 7 0 the k obs for both uv254 and doc at 275 nm are comparable to that at 254 nm however at ph 7 0 the k obs for both uv254 and doc at 275 nm are much higher than that at 254 nm p 0 05 table s3 as for the wavelength of 310 nm it is always less effective than that at 275 nm in all cases and is only more efficient for ha degradation measured by uv254 than that at 254 nm at ph 9 0 these results indicate that the 275 nm uv led is more suitable and can be a promising alternative to the traditional uv mercury lamps 254 nm for ha degradation by the uv chlorine aop in raw water at ph 7 0 in order to further verify the specific behavior of uv chlorine system at the three uv wavelengths the k obs of uv photolysis k obs uv chlorination k obs chlorination and reactive radicals k obs radicals in ha degradation were calculated and displayed in fig 2a the total reaction rate constant k obs t was assumed to be the sum of the k obs uv k obs chlorination and k obs radicals eq 2 then the k obs radicals can be calculated by subtracting the k obs t by the contributions of k obs uv and k obs chlorination 2 ln ha ha 0 k obs t uv fluence k obs uv k obs chlorination k obs radicals uv fluence where ha and ha 0 represent the concentrations of ha at different reaction time and the beginning respectively k obs t is the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constant mj 1 cm2 k obs uv and k obs chlorination are the measured pseudo first order direct photolysis and chlorination rate constants mj 1 cm2 respectively k obs radicals is the pseudo first order degradation rate constant mj 1 cm2 by reactive radicals uv photolysis and direct chlorination both played a minor role in ha removal measured by uv254 the k obs uv remained constant with increasing ph table s2 while the k obs chlorination increased with increasing ph from 5 0 to 8 0 and then decreased at ph 9 0 fig 2a the increase of k obs chlorination can be attributed to the structural conversion of ha from a coil form at acidic conditions to a linear structure in a alkaline environment rodríguez et al 2014 then the decrease at ph 9 0 is mainly due to the weak oxidation ability of ocl which is the dominant species under this circumstance meanwhile the contribution of reactive radicals k obs radicals varied with phs and the trends differed from each other at the three uv wavelengths which will be discussed in the following section 3 2 the variation of k obs of doc removal at the three uv wavelengths exhibited similar trends to that of k obs of uv254 removal except that no change of doc was observed during uv photolysis or chlorination alone fig 2b however the uv254 removal rates were much higher than the corresponding doc removal rates this phenomenon has been reported in a previous research proposing that uv254 was more suitable to represent high molecular aromatic organic matter that can rapidly react with radicals to produce low molecular matter with low uv absorbance phong and hur 2016 3 2 chlorine photodecay rates and their quantum yields to illustrate the different behaviors of ha degradation at the three uv wavelengths and different phs during the uv chlorine aop the fluence based rate constants of chlorine photodecay k obs chlorine were estimated with the results displayed in fig 3 a the results indicated that with increasing ph from 5 0 to 9 0 k obs chlorine decreased by 54 6 at 254 nm and increased by 48 7 and 42 7 at 275 and 310 nm respectively which were in good accordance with the trends in fig 2 this phenomenon could be attributed to the generation of radicals from chlorine photolysis during the uv chlorine process contributing to efficient degradation of ha fang et al 2014 yin et al 2018 moreover we anticipated that the absorption of uv photons by chlorine was responsible for the observed ph dependent photodecay rates according to the grotthuss draper law as displayed in fig 3b the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine at 254 nm decreased slightly while that increased significantly at 275 and 310 nm as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 the uv absorbance of chlorine was correlated with k obs chlorine at the three uv wavelengths supporting that the ph dependency of k obs chlorine is partially due to the ph dependent uv absorptivity this is consistent with other research reporting that the correlation between molar absorption coefficient and chlorine photodecay rate is a positive monotonic function yin et al 2018 on the other hand fig 3b displays the quantum yields of chlorine degradation φchlorine calculated according to eq 3 3 φ chlorine moles of free chlorine decomposed absorbed einsteins k obs chlorine e p s 1 10 al v chlorine where φchlorine represents the quantum yield of aquatic chlorine photolysis mol einstein k obs chlorine is the chlorine photolysis kinetic constant s 1 ep is the uv led irradiance on the surface of a sample einstein s 1 cm 2 s is the surface area of a sample exposed to uv light cm2 a is the absorbance of a sample at a specific wavelength cm 1 l is the effective path length cm v is the volume of a sample l chlorine is the concentration of free chlorine m the quantum yields decreased with increasing uv wavelength at ph 5 0 9 0 at acidic phs e g 7 0 the uv absorbance of aqueous chlorine at the three uv wavelengths decreased in the order of 254 nm 275 nm 310 nm which resulted in the decrease of k obs chlorine with increasing uv wavelengths the synergistic effects of chlorine photodecay rates and quantum yields thus affected the degradation rate constants of ha at ph 7 0 decreased in the order of 254 nm 275 nm 310 nm fig 2 however the absorptivity of chlorine at 275 nm was much higher than that at 254 nm at alkaline phs 7 0 under which circumstance the effect of quantum yields was negligible and thus the superiority at 275 nm over 254 nm in ha degradation was observed fig 2 besides according to the results of photodegradation alone the presence of ha also competed with chlorine for light absorbance so as to inhibit chlorine photolysis at 254 nm uv irradiation as for 310 nm although the uv absorbance of chlorine at ph 7 0 was as high as that at 275 nm fig 3b the inefficient degradation was observed fig 2 for its relatively low quantum yield 3 3 dbp formation during the uv chlorine process at different uv wavelengths 3 3 1 effect of uv fluence on dbp formation the formation of carbonaceous dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps during the uv chlorine aop with uv fluence of 100 1200 mj cm2 and chlorination dark control are presented in fig 4 c dbps including chloroform cf dichloropropanone dcp trichloropropanone tcp dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa and n dbp including dichloroacetonitrile dcan were detected among which thms and haas are regulated dbps and other unregulated dbps exhibit comparable genotoxicity even carcinogenicity and concentrations in drinking water bond et al 2015 richardson et al 2007 for all the processes the time dependent formation of dbps was observed less formation of each dbp species was observed during chlorination than during the uv chlorine process this is ascribed to the much larger chlorine consumptions in the uv chlorine aop compared to chlorination alone fig s5 radicals especially rcss generated from chlorine photolysis may enhance dbp formation through the interactions between rcss and dbp precursors at uv fluence of 100 and 200 mj cm2 the application of 275 nm produced the most abundant dbps followed by 254 nm 310 nm and direct chlorination fig 4a meanwhile from fig 3a the chlorine photodecay rate which could affect the concentrations of radicals such as rcss also had a maximum at 275 nm and ph 8 0 therefore more dbps can be formed by cl substitution and cl addition reactions with the faster production of rcss alegre et al 2000 however the total amount of dbps at 275 nm was lower than that at 254 nm at uv fluence higher than 500 mj cm2 this is probably because more dbp precursors were destructed during uv chlorination at higher uv fluence and 275 nm fig 1 and the formed dbps might also be attacked by reactive radicals although the lowest dbp yield was obtained at 310 nm when applying the uv chlorine aop in all cases the weak decomposition of ha should be taken into account when evaluating the uv chlorine treatment at different uv wavelengths these phenomena indicate that uv led at 275 nm has the potential to replace lpuv lamps for its better performance in dbp control at higher uv fluence e g 500 mj cm2 and ph 8 0 to further understand the effect of uv wavelength and fluence on the formation of individual dbps we analyzed the formation process of each dbp species as displayed in fig 4b f the concentrations of dcan tcp dcaa and tcaa increased with increasing exposure time during chlorination alone whereas dcp was suppressed under the same condition cf increased firstly and then decreased as reaction time went by during chlorination fig s6 notably the uv wavelength also exhibited obvious impact on the formation of specific dbps during co exposure process the yields of specific dbps achieved the highest at 275 nm and low uv fluence but peaked at 254 or 310 nm subsequently among the specific dbps the concentrations of cf dcan and tcp presented an increasing and then decreasing trend during the uv chlorine process figs s6 and 4b and4d while the increasing trends remained stable for other dbps dcp dcaa and tcaa at longer uv exposure fig 4c e and 4f these dbps were formed continuously from the reactions of rcss with ha nevertheless exorbitant ho can lead to the mineralization of dbp precursors and attack the produced dbps causing the reduction of some dbps as uv fluence increased von 2007 overall thm1 cf and haa2 dcaa and tcaa predominated among the detected dbps on a molar basis fig s7 in all cases when increasing exposure time the percentage of haa2 in the formed dbps was enhanced 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm direct chlorination and that of thm1 declined accordingly 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm direct chlorination this implies that increasing reaction time can sharply reduce the proportion of thm1 but not haa2 3 3 2 effect of ph on dbp formation fig 5 displays the formation of dbps during chlorination and the uv chlorine process at different ph values at low uv fluence 100 mj cm2 the yields of dbps increased as ph increased during chlorination alone except for ph 9 0 fig 5a which is consistent with the trend of uv254 degradation fig 2a as for uv chlorine oxidation at acidic conditions the total amount of dbps at 254 nm was the highest followed by 275 nm and 310 nm however at ph values higher than 7 0 the uv led 275 nm chlorine process produced the most abundant dbps this phenomenon could be explained by the different rates of chlorine photolysis at the three uv wavelengths fig 3a when uv fluence was up to 1200 mj cm2 abundant rcss were generated to react with precursors to produce more dbps compared to that at 100 mj cm2 uv fluence fig 5b however it should be mentioned that 275 nm uv light exhibited significant inhibition on dbp formation under alkaline conditions which might be due to the effective destruction of dbp precursors and the formed dbps at high uv fluence fig 1 and s3 therefore for the source water at alkaline conditions 275 nm uv led at high uv fluence can be a good choice to control dbp formation in uv chlorine treatment the dbp concentrations were confirmed to be dominated by thm1 and haa2 on a molar basis fig s8 at uv fluence of 100 mj cm2 thm1 and haa2 accounted for 15 1 46 5 and 48 9 76 2 respectively of the detected dbps and the contribution of haas increased with decreasing ph fig s8a this may be explained by the reaction mechanisms that base catalyzed hydrolysis yields more thms under alkaline conditions and more haas will be formed in acidic environments when the precursor donates an electron pair to the rest of the molecule liang and singer 2003 as uv fluence increased to 1200 mj cm2 fig s8b haa2 were still dominant but the significant suppression of the percentage of thm1 was achieved decreased to 3 6 21 3 3 3 3 the role of initial bromide concentration on the formation of dbps naturally occurring br in raw water could readily be incorporated into dbps in order to investigate the influence of br concentration on the formation of dbps different concentrations of br were spiked and the results are displayed in fig 6 the formation of brominated dbps br dbps increased but chlorinated dbps decreased as br concentration increased from 0 to 10 μm fig 6a this might be due to the formation of more hobr at higher br concentration that promoted the formation of br dbps hua et al 2006 kumar and margerum 1987 the total amount of dbps except bromate exhibited similar trends to the results in fig 5 that the yield of dbps reached the highest level at 275 nm at 100 mj cm2 uv fluence fig 5a whereas at 1200 mj cm2 the maximum dbp yield was achieved at 254 nm fig 5b however bromate accounted for 42 7 73 6 of the detected dbps on a molar basis during chlorination and the uv chlorine process and decreased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm direct chlorination fig 6a the results agreed with the observed rate constants of chlorine photodecay in fig 3a the reactive species formed during the uv chlorine process may enhance the formation of bromate by a series oxidation of br to hobr or obr and then to bromate von gunten 2003 due to the predominant bromate the yields of dbps reached a maximum at 275 nm 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm chlorination alone resulting in similar changes in buf fig 6b moreover in the absence of uv light chlorination converted 15 6 25 9 of br to bromate 9 8 22 3 to detected br dbps and 29 0 36 2 to unknown intermediate products respectively fig 6c in contrast in the presence of uv irradiation co exposure generated more bromate 20 3 60 0 and less unknown intermediates 20 0 33 7 this could be attributed to the powerful oxidizing ability of reactive species generated during the uv chlorine process which enhanced the conversion of br to bromate fang et al 2017 3 4 evaluation of theoretical cytotoxicity of detected dbps 3 4 1 effect of uv fluence on theoretical cytotoxicity fig 7 displays the calculated cytotoxicity of detected dbps which kept rising as reaction time went by during chlorination while the calculated toxicity increased first and then decreased during the uv chlorine aop at the three uv wavelengths these trends are consistent with the changes of dcan concentrations fig 4b because dcan was the major contributor to the calculated dbp associated toxicity fig s9 due to its low lc50 value muellner et al 2007 although thm1 and haa2 dominated in the detected dbps on a molar basis fig s7 with the increase of reaction time the application of chlorine alone would enhance the calculated toxicity resulting from the increasing contribution of dcan comparatively the calculated toxicity was relatively reduced 12 5 29 0 and 17 2 at 254 275 and 310 nm respectively at 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence by the uv chlorine process due to the effective mitigation of dcan formation at longer reaction time and the lowest value of calculated toxicity was observed at 275 nm fig 7 3 4 2 effect of ph on theoretical cytotoxicity the influence of ph on the calculated dbp associated toxicity is displayed in fig 8 at uv fluence of 100 mj cm2 the calculated toxicity reached a maximum at neutral ph then decreased somewhat afterward fig 8a this trend is consistent with the changes of dcan concentrations fig 5a because dcan exhibits considerably higher toxicity compared with other dbps table s1 constituting more than 46 1 of the total toxicity fig s10a in other words uv chlorine treatment significantly enhanced the calculated toxicity due to the promotion of dcan formation at higher uv fluence 1200 mj cm2 fig 8b it is worth noting that the calculated toxicity at alkaline conditions and 275 nm was remarkably lower than that during chlorination alone as well as 254 and 310 nm in fig s10b although haa2 constituted a very large proportion of the total toxicity 32 4 81 4 dcan still played a significant role in the calculated toxicity at higher uv fluence and alkaline conditions the uv wavelength of 275 nm can mitigate the formation of dcan effectively leading to the lowest calculated toxicity compared to that of 254 and 310 nm 3 4 3 effect of initial bromide concentration on theoretical cytotoxicity fig 9 presents the influence of initial br concentration on theoretical cytotoxicity of the detected dbps the calculated toxicity for all the four processes increased remarkably with the increase of br concentration this can be explained by the significantly enhanced formation of hans and haas especially their brominated species such as bcan dban and mbaa with the low lc50 values muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2010 which are major contributors 80 to the total toxicity however with increasing uv fluence from 100 to 1200 mj cm2 the application of 275 nm obviously minimized the calculated toxicity regardless of the br concentration during uv chlorination this is due to the effective mitigation of hans the above observations suggest that uv led with 275 nm may be selected for reducing the calculated toxicity in uv chlorine treatment furthermore the cytotoxicity calculated based on the detected dbps only provides us a convenient way to compare dbp associated toxicity experiments may be conducted to get a more comprehensive understanding about dbp mixture in future studies 4 conclusions this study compared the degradation efficiency of ha by the uv chlorine aop at three uv wavelengths 254 275 and 310 nm the degradation of uv254 and doc followed pseudo first order kinetics k obs decreased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm at ph 7 0 the removal rates of uv254 and doc were strongly dependent on uv wavelength and solution ph which could interfere with the chlorine photo chemistry ha degradation at 254 nm decreased with increasing ph whereas the uv chlorine aop at 275 and 310 nm presented remarkably efficient treatment efficiency at high solution phs these trends were also observed in chlorine photodecay rates at the three uv wavelengths the results imply that uv light at 275 nm is more suitable for ha reduction by the uv chlorine process and exhibits higher removal capacity than conventional treatments in real water ph of approximately 7 5 8 5 dbp formation and toxicity alteration during the uv chlorine process are also major concerns for practical applications the synergistic effect of uv and chlorine enhanced the formation of dbps due to the involvement of rcss as uv fluence increased from 100 to 1200 mj cm2 the yields of dbps kept increasing at the three uv wavelengths at relatively low uv fluence the yields of dbps decreased in the order of 275 nm 254 nm 310 nm however at relatively high uv fluence the yields of dbps decreased in the order of 254 nm 275 nm 310 nm also lower yields of dbps can be obtained at 275 nm than 254 nm at longer reaction time regardless of the ph value however in the presence of br the uv chlorine aop produced much more abundant dbps due to the promotive oxidation of br to bromate notably the calculated toxicity of detected dbps could be reduced at 275 nm uv light at alkaline conditions and high uv fluence due to less formation of hans therefore uv led 275 nm is a promising alternative to the conventional uv mercury lamps 254 nm for ha degradation by the uv chlorine process with high uv fluence at neutral and alkaline phs considering the short transmittance of uv led light in water this new uv led chlorine process is targeted at new and existing small scale water treatment i e point of use applications and water supplies in rural areas however water matrix characteristics such as flow rate and alkalinity can greatly affect the efficiency of the uv led chlorine process therefore more detailed study should be performed prior to further recommendation of the practical applications in the field acknowledgments this study was financially supported

18979,dissolved black carbon dbc involves in many biogeochemical processes in both terrestrial and aquatic environments about 26 5 tg of charcoal or black carbon derived dbc was released into aquatic environments annually accounting to 10 of the global riverine flux of dissolved organic carbon doc yet the sorption behaviors of dbc and their effects on water quality in soil water environment are poorly understood here we examined the molecular composition variations of doc induced by the sorption of two biochar derived dbcs pyrolyzed at 300 c and 500 c on three contrasting soils the dbcs were adsorbed mainly through competitive displacement of soil surface functional groups and co sorption with soil indigenous doc which varied with soil properties and the aromaticity of the dbcs ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry analysis indicated that compounds with rich oxygen content or unsaturated structures such as tannins and unsaturated aromatics from both dbc and soil doc were preferentially adsorbed on the soils in the presence of dbc in contrast compounds with high aromatic structures including condensed aromatics and lignins were concentrated in the aquatic phase molecular fractionation also occurred to the heteroatomic compounds during the sorption and the heteroatomic dissolved organic sulphur in the dbcs was easier to be adsorbed relative to dissolved organic nitrogen our results suggest that dbc sorption in soil water environment could have important implications for water quality by altering doc molecular composition and decreasing doc molecular diversity at the soil water interface this study provides essential information for understanding the behavior of dbc in the environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen dissolved organic sulfur molecular composition fractionation 1 introduction black carbon bc of natural or anthropogenic origins is of great relevance to the cycling of a range of elements and contaminants and it is gaining increasing interest in agricultural and environmental fields abiven et al 2014 ouyang et al 2016 dissolved black carbon dbc the water soluble fraction of bc can be readily mobilized from its parent materials and dispersed into soil environments and finally transported to aquatic environments jaffé et al 2013 qu et al 2016 it was estimated that about 26 5 tg of charcoal or bc derived dbc was released into aquatic environments per year which is 10 of the global riverine flux of dissolved organic carbon doc jaffé et al 2013 before released into aquatic environments the dbc could be adsorbed by soil accompanying with the application of bulk bc in the environment which is one of the primary processes governing the transport and fate of dbc in soil water environment furthermore the sorption behaviors of dbc might affect doc quality and quantity in soil and aquatic environments therefore understanding the sorption of dbc in soil water environment is therefore critical for predicting the fate and impacts of dbc in the environments the composition of dbc is complicated depending on feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures chen et al 2017 and detailed characterization of its molecular composition is technically challenging the compositional complexity of dbc limits our understanding of its sorption behaviors in the environment previous studies on the interactions between doc and soil matrices provided fundamental clues for understanding dbc sorption it was suggested that sorption to soil minerals largely controls doc retention by soil and the hydrophobic fraction of doc is preferentially adsorbed relative to the hydrophilic fraction avneri katz et al 2017 jardine et al 1989 oren and chefetz 2012 xue et al 2009 specifically compounds with high molecular weight 500 da high unsaturation degree or o containing functional groups are preferentially adsorbed on mineral surfaces lv et al 2016 dbc characteristic by high aromaticity dittmar 2008 hao et al 2018 possesses distinctive molecular composition that differs from natural doc and bulk biochars hao et al 2018 qu et al 2016 it is therefore expected that the pyrogenic dbc may have different sorption behaviors at the soil water interface relative to natural doc and that its sorption has complicated effects on c cycling and contaminant transportation in the receiving soil and aquatic environments fu et al 2018 tang et al 2016 the key to understanding the behaviors and reactions of dbc in the environment is obtaining its detailed chemical composition qu et al 2016 seifert et al 2016 the molecular composition of the polycyclic aromatic portion in dbc has been well documented dittmar 2008 dittmar et al 2012 hao et al 2018 kim et al 2004 however no study has been conducted to characterize the sorption of dbc in soil water environment and the reaction mechanisms remain poorly understood to date it is reasonable to suppose that the molecular compositions of dbcs might be distinctly changed after sorption compared to their pristine samples in addition pyrogenic dbc consists of thermally altered heterogeneous molecules with considerable n and s contents although the heteroatomic molecules play important roles in the photodegradation and transformation reactions at soil and water interfaces their behaviors have rarely been characterized in soil and aquatic environments knicker 2007 li et al 2018 the complexity of dbc composition and the importance of obtaining thorough and detailed molecular composition information require the use of advanced analytical techniques electrospray ionization coupled to fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms can provide detailed molecular composition e g bio resistant and n containing molecules of doc including dbc dittmar and paeng 2009 wagner et al 2015 ward et al 2014 and enable the tracing of their origin and molecular variations during various environmental processes koch et al 2005 lv et al 2016 ward et al 2014 therefore the application of ft icr ms may help fill the current knowledge gap the aim of the present study was to explore the sorption and fractionation of dbc including heteroatomic molecules in soil water environment we hypothesized that dbc sorption on soils with different clay and organic carbon contents would alter the molecular composition of doc and thus water quality at the soil and water interfaces to this end two dbc samples extracted from maize straw derived biochars pyrolyzed at 300 c and 500 c were selected because of their distinct molecular composition chen et al 2017 and three soil samples with contrasting properties were used a combination of ft icr ms high pressure size exclusion chromatography hpsec and fourier transform infrared ft ir was used to discern detailed molecular changes of doc during dbc sorption in soil water environment and explore the underlying sorption mechanism in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials dbc samples were extracted from maize zea mays l straw derived biochars which were prepared by pyrolysis at 300 and 500 c respectively for 1 h under n2 atmosphere in a muffle furnace luo et al 2015 briefly the prepared biochars were grounded into powder passed through a 100 mesh 0 15 mm sieve the bulk biochars were extracted using deionized h2o with 100 mg l nan3 used to inhibit microbial activity at the solid to solution ratios of 1 100 and 1 15 for the biochars produced at 300 and 500 c to obtain dbc concentrations of about 130 mg c l and 50 mg c l respectively the suspensions were stirred at 120 rpm at 25 c in the dark for 72 h the final ph of the suspensions was kept to 6 8 0 1 by adding either 0 1 mol l hcl or naoh solution the resulting suspensions were filtered through 0 45 μm mixed cellulose acetate filters and the filtrates were kept in the dark at 4 c and designated as dbc300 and dbc500 respectively the dbcs were used within 24 h after the extraction for the following characterization and sorption experiments three agricultural soils namely black soil red soil and fluvo aquic soil were used as adsorbents for sorption experiments the properties of the soils are listed in supplementary table s1 to investigate the effect of indigenous organic carbon of the soils on dbc sorption soil organic carbon was removed using hot 30 h2o2 luo et al 2008 the treated samples were then washed thoroughly with deionized h2o freeze dried and used as references for the following experiments 2 2 sorption experiments batch sorption experiments of dbcs initial concentration of 0 100 mg c l for dbc300 and 0 50 mg c l for dbc500 on the pristine and h2o2 treated soils were conducted in glass centrifuge tubes the solid to liquid ratio was kept to 1 10 at this ratio the concentrations of soil indigenous doc referred to as sdoc hereafter ranged from 12 29 to 69 30 mg c l which were comparable to the added dbcs and sdoc in the h2o2 treated soils was below 0 01 mg c l the suspensions were equilibrated on a reciprocating shaker at 120 rpm at 25 c for 72 h in the dark a 30 day kinetic measurement showed that the dbc molecules were stable in water solutions and settlement or transformation was negligible during the period and that 72 h was a sufficient time period for dbcs to reach an equilibrium sorption on the soils fig s1 the ph of the suspensions was monitored and adjusted to neutral 6 8 during the reaction after equilibration the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and filtered via 0 45 μm filters the apparent sorption amount of dbc on the soils was calculated by the concentration difference of doc between the initial indigenous doc plus added dbc and adsorbed solutions soil suspensions no dbc added and dbc solutions no soil added were used separately as controls to monitor sdoc release and dbc biodegradation experiments were carried out

properties surface area and pore size distribution of the soils before and after sorption were characterized with n2 and co2 adsorption techniques after outgassing for 4 6 h at 423 k and soil ζ potential was determined as described previously luo et al 2010 the molecular composition of dbcs was characterized with a bruker solarix ft icr ms equipped with a 15 0 t superconducting magnet and an esi ion source which was described in detail by lv et al 2016 briefly the desalinated samples were analyzed in negative ionization mode the spectra were externally calibrated with 10 mmol l of sodium

pristine soils as shown in fig 1 exhibited an initial steep slope and approached a plateau at elevated dbc concentrations dbc300 showed stronger affinity to the soils than dbc500 regardless of soil types the red soil showed the highest sorption capacity for dbc300 followed by the fluvo aquic and black soils in contrast the black soil showed the highest sorption capacity for dbc500 followed by the fluvo aquic and red soils it is worthy to note that the equilibrium concentrations of doc were significantly lower than their initial doc sdoc plus added dbc concentrations p 0 01 for dbc300 sorption at low initial concentrations of dbcs 10 mg l similarly hereinafter for dbc500 sorption at the low concentrations the equilibrium concentrations of doc were also no higher than their initial concentrations the results indicated that the input dbcs facilitated the retention of sdoc on the soils after removal of organic carbon with h2o2 the treated soils showed enhanced sorption of both dbc300 and dbc500 at high dbc concentrations while decreased sorption at low concentrations compared to the pristine soils fig s2 these differences in the sorption of dbcs between the pristine soils and the organic carbon removed soils suggested the important influence of clay minerals and organic carbon on the sorption possible mechanisms leading to the soil type and dbc type dependent sorption will be discussed in details below sorption mechanisms of dbcs at soil water interface 3 2 molecular fractionation of dbcs sorption on soil not only reduced the content of doc including sdoc and dbcs but also altered its molecular composition as shown in fig 2 overall molecular weight of the sdocs was slightly higher than that of dbc300 and dbc500 and all of which were below 3000 da doc of relatively large molecular weight was preferentially adsorbed on the soils evidenced by the decreased proportion of large molecules in the residual doc the selective sorption was observed on both the three soils regardless of dbc types meanwhile ft ir spectroscopy fig s3 revealed that carboxylic carbon oc o 1700 cm 1 and aliphatic or carbohydrate oh groups 1110 cm 1 gu et al 1994 qu et al 2016 in the residual doc were significantly decreased compared to those in the pristine dbc samples in contrast aromatic structure c c around 1600 and 1430 cm 1 gu et al 1994 tended to be enriched in the residual doc the results suggested that the o rich functional groups from both dbcs and sdocs were preferentially adsorbed on the soils avneri katz et al 2017 jardine et al 1989 lusk and toor 2016 detailed molecular variations of the doc during the dbc sorption were further characterized using ft icr ms the spectrum of each sample resolved over thousands of singly charged peaks fig 3 the relative abundance weighted average molecular weight of dbc500 458 7 da based on over 3000 identified molecular formulas was higher than that of dbc300 426 0 da in contrast to the hpsec results the average molecular weights of sdoc were slightly lower than that of dbc300 fig 3 and s4 the results implied that the highly aromatic dbc molecules might be less clustered in solutions since the doc fractions separated by hpsec are more likely molecular clusters but not individual molecules lv et al 2016 based on the van krevelen diagrams fig 4 it is evident that dbcs and sdoc both shared some similarities in their molecular compositions mainly characteristic of lignin type phenolic compounds species and they had differences as well for example dbc500 exhibited predominant aromatic fraction compared to dbc300 and all the sdoc contained higher proportions of h saturated lipids and proteins fractions and o saturated tannins fraction than dbc samples the differences in the molecular composition and heterogeneity between dbcs and sdoc allowed to trace the sorption behaviors of dbcs on the soils the high o c fractions tannins and carbohydrates in the residual doc decreased over 32 compared to those in the pristine sdoc after the sorption figs 4 6 concomitantly the unsaturated hydrocarbons and proteins fractions in the residual doc also greatly decreased in contrast the aromatic structure rich fractions condensed aromatics and lignins in the residual doc increased over 16 compared to those in the pristine sdoc fig 6 it is noteworthy that the doc with molecular weight below 350 da and above 500 da significantly decreased in the adsorbed solutions compared to the pristine sdoc and dbcs and the trend was particularly obvious for dbc500 sorption at low concentrations fig 5 and s5 3 3 molecular fractionation of heteroatomic compounds elemental analysis indicated that the dbcs contained high contents of n and s compared to their bulk bcs table s2 and ft icr ms analysis confirmed that these elements were embedded in heteroatomic molecules in the dbcs consistent with previous studies wagner et al 2015 the dbcs consisted of fewer n containing compounds compared to sdoc fig s6 the result was possibly related to the volatilization of unstable n from dbcs during pyrolysis and the n fertilization effect on sdoc composition gonsior et al 2011 wagner et al 2015 sorption on soil induced limited alteration to the heteroatomic molecules with n while substantially decreased the heteroatomic molecules with s fig s6 previous studies suggested that dissolved black nitrogen existed primarily as aromatic pyrrole type moieties wagner et al 2015 and therefore its affinity to soil was weak s k edge xanes analysis of the dbcs fig s7 indicated that intermediate oxidation state organic s rs o and oxidized organic s ester s r oso3 accounted for 39 and 11 of total s in dbc300 and 24 and 70 of total s in dbc500 respectively these polar o containing moieties had stronger affinity to soils compared to other hydrophobic functionalities lv et al 2016 and were more preferentially adsorbed the contrasting sorption behaviors of chon and chos molecules further confirmed the occurrence of adsorptive fractionation for both dbcs and sdoc on soil 3 4 sorption mechanisms of dbcs at soil water interface once input into soils different molecules moieties of the dbcs exhibited contrasting affinity to soil components for example o rich carboxylic and phenolic moieties had high affinity to iron oxyhydroxides lv et al 2016 while aromatic moieties showed strong affinity to organic carbon chefetz and xing 2009 luo et al 2010 which caused adsorptive fractionation in their molecular compositions previous studies proposed that soil sorption mechanisms of doc include ligand exchange electrostatic interaction hydrophobic interaction and cation bridging depending on the interplay between soil properties composition and structure of doc and solution chemistry avneri katz et al 2017 gu et al 1994 jardine et al 1989 oren and chefetz 2012 the dbc sorption released over 26 new formulas in the residual doc fig 3 and s4 particularly dbc500 sorption released more new doc molecules than dbc300 sorption fig s8 these observations suggested that dbc molecules displaced small organic carbon moieties on the soil surfaces through competitive sorption the dbc500 molecules due to their high aromaticity showed high affinity to soil organic carbon and thus could primarily displace weakly bound organic carbon moieties other than hydroxyl groups on clay minerals in contrast dbc300 as a mixture rich with o rich functional groups like natural doc was prone to be adsorbed on clay surfaces by displacing hydroxyl groups that is adsorbed through ligand exchanges avneri katz et al 2017 gu et al 1994 lv et al 2016 the competitive sorption mechanisms consistent with the preferential sorption of carboxylic moieties as revealed by ft ir data fig s3 could be further confirmed by solution ph and soil surface property variations for example the solution ph increased slightly 0 5 ph unit for dbc500 while increased significantly 0 5 ph unit for dbc300 after sorption on the pristine soils which could be ascribed to the release of hydroxyl groups from soil surfaces by the dbc molecules jardine et al 1989 lv et al 2016 in the presence of dbc300 more hydroxyl groups were released and thus ph was significantly increased meanwhile the ζ potentials of the pristine soils were barely changed during the sorption at ph 6 8 in addition the micropore and mesopore as well as specific surface areas of the soils were not affected by dbc500 sorption but decreased slightly by dbc300 sorption as revealed by n2 and co2 sorption analyses fig s9 the decreased specific surface areas could be ascribed to the clogged porosity by the adsorbed dbc300 moieties through displacing parts of hydroxyl groups and small organic moieties on clay surfaces kaiser and guggenberger 2003 luo et al 2010 otherwise for example an electrostatic dominant sorption would induce decreased soil ζ potentials after adsorbed the negative moieties of dbcs luo et al 2010 lv et al 2016 the higher sorption of dbcs on the pristine soils than on the organic carbon removed soils at the low concentrations indicated that dbc molecules could be adsorbed through co flocculation co sorption with sdoc on soil surfaces besides through the ligand exchange reactions although sdoc could suppress the sorption of doc on soil because of their competition for the limited sorption sites jardine et al 1989 kaiser and zech 1997 the dbc molecules could complex with unsaturated aromatics and h saturated fractions of sdoc through π π interactions and h bond due to their aromatic moieties chefetz and xing 2009 luo et al 2014 and with oxidized moieties of sdoc through cation bridging in the presence of cations and facilitated their co sorption luo et al 2010 seifert et al 2016 xu et al 2017 the co sorption consistent with the decrease of the doc molecules with low double bond equivalency dbe number of rings plus double bonds expected for a given molecular formula 6 and high dbe 14 fig s10 after the sorption significantly decreased the overall molecular diversity of the residual doc at the soil water interface the three soils exhibited distinct adsorptive behaviors for the dbcs which could be partially attributed to their different properties for example the red soil exhibited the strongest sorption for the dbc300 because of the high affinity of iron oxyhydroxides to o rich organic moieties avneri katz et al 2017 lv et al 2016 meanwhile the red soil had weak affinity for the h saturated fractions such as lipids and proteins in the presence of dbc500 which was consistent with the weak sorption of the h saturated fractions on iron oxyhydroxides lv et al 2016 in contrast the fluvo aquic soil showed the weakest affinity to aromatics fractions of the dbc molecules fig 5 probably due to its low organic carbon and clay contents the contrasting sorption of dbc300 and dbc500 on the black soil could also be ascribed to the highest organic carbon content in the soil as stated above organic carbon has strong affinity to aromatic dbc500 while suppress the sorption of o rich dbc300 3 5 practical implications of dbc sorption at soil water environment this research offers insights on the fate of dbc input with bulk bc in soil environments and its effects on the molecular composition of doc in the received aquatic environments which have significant impacts on the quality and reactivity of doc in the environments the selective sorption of dbc on soil induces its molecular fractionation by conserving hydrophobic aromatic compounds in solutions previous studies indicated that the aromatic compounds in doc are refractory to biotic and abiotic degradation fu et al 2016 ward et al 2017 xue et al 2009 therefore the retained aromatic fractions could be translocated over long distances and finally accumulated as refractory dbc in oceanic environments aluwihare et al 2005 jaffé et al 2013 the weak sorption of the pyrogenic organic nitrogen compounds on soil implies that dissolved organic nitrogen loss through translocation from soil to aqueous phase might be much more important than previously believed jaffé et al 2013 meanwhile dbc can be much more effective more than one order of magnitude than natural doc in binding hydrophobic organic contaminant and enhancing their water solubility fu et al 2018 the enrichment of aromatic fractions of dbc after sorption on soil could therefore have important implications on organic contaminant fates for example it can bind strongly with the contaminants as sorbents and facilitate the translocation of the contaminants as carriers in the soil and water environments furthermore the phenolic and aromatic carbons as well as dissolved organic sulphur are more susceptible to photo or chemical transformation fu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 ward et al 2017 under the influence of solar irradiation or chemical oxidants these phenolic aromatic and s containing compounds can efficiently generate reactive oxygen species and thus facilitate the transformation of dbc and the associated organic contaminants fu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 thus the fractionation can facilitate the translocation and subsequent transformation of organic contaminants complexed with dbc molecules in the environments to date the refractory and degradation behaviors of pristine dbc before and after sorption on soil sediment remain largely unknown which limit our understanding of the environmental behaviors and fate of dbc in the environment further researches regarding the geo and bio reactions of the fractionated dbc during its translocation processes and its role in the transformation of c and contaminants are warranted 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the sorption of dbcs and their impacts on doc quality in soil water environment using hpsec ft ir and ft icr ms analyses based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 combined spectroscopic and mass analyses provided detailed molecular and functional information on the dbc sorption at soil water environment 2 dbc molecules were adsorbed mainly via competitive displacement and co sorption reactions at soil water environment 3 molecular fractionation occurred to doc at soil water interface during dbc sorption and o rich hydrophilic fractions of both dbc and soil doc with large molecular weight were preferentially adsorbed while the aromatic fractions were retained in aquatic phase 4 dbc sorption could induce significant molecular changes of doc decrease its molecular diversity increase its aromaticity and thus affect its reactivity at soil water interface 5 molecular fractionation also occurred to the biochar derived dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved organic sulfur during

18979,dissolved black carbon dbc involves in many biogeochemical processes in both terrestrial and aquatic environments about 26 5 tg of charcoal or black carbon derived dbc was released into aquatic environments annually accounting to 10 of the global riverine flux of dissolved organic carbon doc yet the sorption behaviors of dbc and their effects on water quality in soil water environment are poorly understood here we examined the molecular composition variations of doc induced by the sorption of two biochar derived dbcs pyrolyzed at 300 c and 500 c on three contrasting soils the dbcs were adsorbed mainly through competitive displacement of soil surface functional groups and co sorption with soil indigenous doc which varied with soil properties and the aromaticity of the dbcs ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry analysis indicated that compounds with rich oxygen content or unsaturated structures such as tannins and unsaturated aromatics from both dbc and soil doc were preferentially adsorbed on the soils in the presence of dbc in contrast compounds with high aromatic structures including condensed aromatics and lignins were concentrated in the aquatic phase molecular fractionation also occurred to the heteroatomic compounds during the sorption and the heteroatomic dissolved organic sulphur in the dbcs was easier to be adsorbed relative to dissolved organic nitrogen our results suggest that dbc sorption in soil water environment could have important implications for water quality by altering doc molecular composition and decreasing doc molecular diversity at the soil water interface this study provides essential information for understanding the behavior of dbc in the environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen dissolved organic sulfur molecular composition fractionation 1 introduction black carbon bc of natural or anthropogenic origins is of great relevance to the cycling of a range of elements and contaminants and it is gaining increasing interest in agricultural and environmental fields abiven et al 2014 ouyang et al 2016 dissolved black carbon dbc the water soluble fraction of bc can be readily mobilized from its parent materials and dispersed into soil environments and finally transported to aquatic environments jaffé et al 2013 qu et al 2016 it was estimated that about 26 5 tg of charcoal or bc derived dbc was released into aquatic environments per year which is 10 of the global riverine flux of dissolved organic carbon doc jaffé et al 2013 before released into aquatic environments the dbc could be adsorbed by soil accompanying with the application of bulk bc in the environment which is one of the primary processes governing the transport and fate of dbc in soil water environment furthermore the sorption behaviors of dbc might affect doc quality and quantity in soil and aquatic environments therefore understanding the sorption of dbc in soil water environment is therefore critical for predicting the fate and impacts of dbc in the environments the composition of dbc is complicated depending on feedstock types and pyrolysis temperatures chen et al 2017 and detailed characterization of its molecular composition is technically challenging the compositional complexity of dbc limits our understanding of its sorption behaviors in the environment previous studies on the interactions between doc and soil matrices provided fundamental clues for understanding dbc sorption it was suggested that sorption to soil minerals largely controls doc retention by soil and the hydrophobic fraction of doc is preferentially adsorbed relative to the hydrophilic fraction avneri katz et al 2017 jardine et al 1989 oren and chefetz 2012 xue et al 2009 specifically compounds with high molecular weight 500 da high unsaturation degree or o containing functional groups are preferentially adsorbed on mineral surfaces lv et al 2016 dbc characteristic by high aromaticity dittmar 2008 hao et al 2018 possesses distinctive molecular composition that differs from natural doc and bulk biochars hao et al 2018 qu et al 2016 it is therefore expected that the pyrogenic dbc may have different sorption behaviors at the soil water interface relative to natural doc and that its sorption has complicated effects on c cycling and contaminant transportation in the receiving soil and aquatic environments fu et al 2018 tang et al 2016 the key to understanding the behaviors and reactions of dbc in the environment is obtaining its detailed chemical composition qu et al 2016 seifert et al 2016 the molecular composition of the polycyclic aromatic portion in dbc has been well documented dittmar 2008 dittmar et al 2012 hao et al 2018 kim et al 2004 however no study has been conducted to characterize the sorption of dbc in soil water environment and the reaction mechanisms remain poorly understood to date it is reasonable to suppose that the molecular compositions of dbcs might be distinctly changed after sorption compared to their pristine samples in addition pyrogenic dbc consists of thermally altered heterogeneous molecules with considerable n and s contents although the heteroatomic molecules play important roles in the photodegradation and transformation reactions at soil and water interfaces their behaviors have rarely been characterized in soil and aquatic environments knicker 2007 li et al 2018 the complexity of dbc composition and the importance of obtaining thorough and detailed molecular composition information require the use of advanced analytical techniques electrospray ionization coupled to fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms can provide detailed molecular composition e g bio resistant and n containing molecules of doc including dbc dittmar and paeng 2009 wagner et al 2015 ward et al 2014 and enable the tracing of their origin and molecular variations during various environmental processes koch et al 2005 lv et al 2016 ward et al 2014 therefore the application of ft icr ms may help fill the current knowledge gap the aim of the present study was to explore the sorption and fractionation of dbc including heteroatomic molecules in soil water environment we hypothesized that dbc sorption on soils with different clay and organic carbon contents would alter the molecular composition of doc and thus water quality at the soil and water interfaces to this end two dbc samples extracted from maize straw derived biochars pyrolyzed at 300 c and 500 c were selected because of their distinct molecular composition chen et al 2017 and three soil samples with contrasting properties were used a combination of ft icr ms high pressure size exclusion chromatography hpsec and fourier transform infrared ft ir was used to discern detailed molecular changes of doc during dbc sorption in soil water environment and explore the underlying sorption mechanism in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials dbc samples were extracted from maize zea mays l straw derived biochars which were prepared by pyrolysis at 300 and 500 c respectively for 1 h under n2 atmosphere in a muffle furnace luo et al 2015 briefly the prepared biochars were grounded into powder passed through a 100 mesh 0 15 mm sieve the bulk biochars were extracted using deionized h2o with 100 mg l nan3 used to inhibit microbial activity at the solid to solution ratios of 1 100 and 1 15 for the biochars produced at 300 and 500 c to obtain dbc concentrations of about 130 mg c l and 50 mg c l respectively the suspensions were stirred at 120 rpm at 25 c in the dark for 72 h the final ph of the suspensions was kept to 6 8 0 1 by adding either 0 1 mol l hcl or naoh solution the resulting suspensions were filtered through 0 45 μm mixed cellulose acetate filters and the filtrates were kept in the dark at 4 c and designated as dbc300 and dbc500 respectively the dbcs were used within 24 h after the extraction for the following characterization and sorption experiments three agricultural soils namely black soil red soil and fluvo aquic soil were used as adsorbents for sorption experiments the properties of the soils are listed in supplementary table s1 to investigate the effect of indigenous organic carbon of the soils on dbc sorption soil organic carbon was removed using hot 30 h2o2 luo et al 2008 the treated samples were then washed thoroughly with deionized h2o freeze dried and used as references for the following experiments 2 2 sorption experiments batch sorption experiments of dbcs initial concentration of 0 100 mg c l for dbc300 and 0 50 mg c l for dbc500 on the pristine and h2o2 treated soils were conducted in glass centrifuge tubes the solid to liquid ratio was kept to 1 10 at this ratio the concentrations of soil indigenous doc referred to as sdoc hereafter ranged from 12 29 to 69 30 mg c l which were comparable to the added dbcs and sdoc in the h2o2 treated soils was below 0 01 mg c l the suspensions were equilibrated on a reciprocating shaker at 120 rpm at 25 c for 72 h in the dark a 30 day kinetic measurement showed that the dbc molecules were stable in water solutions and settlement or transformation was negligible during the period and that 72 h was a sufficient time period for dbcs to reach an equilibrium sorption on the soils fig s1 the ph of the suspensions was monitored and adjusted to neutral 6 8 during the reaction after equilibration the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and filtered via 0 45 μm filters the apparent sorption amount of dbc on the soils was calculated by the concentration difference of doc between the initial indigenous doc plus added dbc and adsorbed solutions soil suspensions no dbc added and dbc solutions no soil added were used separately as controls to monitor sdoc release and dbc biodegradation experiments were carried out with three replicates 2 3 molecular characterization of dbc and doc dbc and sdoc in the filtered supernatants 0 45 μm before and after soil sorption were subjected to the following characterization

structure rich fractions condensed aromatics and lignins in the residual doc increased over 16 compared to those in the pristine sdoc fig 6 it is noteworthy that the doc with molecular weight below 350 da and above 500 da significantly decreased in the adsorbed solutions compared to the pristine sdoc and dbcs and the trend was particularly obvious for dbc500 sorption at low concentrations fig 5 and s5 3 3 molecular fractionation of heteroatomic compounds elemental analysis indicated that the dbcs contained high contents of n and s compared to their bulk bcs table s2 and ft icr ms analysis confirmed that these elements were embedded in heteroatomic molecules in the dbcs consistent with previous studies wagner et al 2015 the dbcs consisted of fewer n containing compounds compared to sdoc fig s6 the result was possibly related to the volatilization of unstable n from dbcs during pyrolysis and the n fertilization effect on sdoc composition gonsior et al 2011 wagner et al 2015 sorption on soil induced limited alteration to the heteroatomic molecules with n while substantially decreased the heteroatomic molecules with s fig s6 previous studies suggested that dissolved black nitrogen existed primarily as aromatic pyrrole type moieties wagner et al 2015 and therefore its affinity to soil was weak s k edge xanes analysis of the dbcs fig s7 indicated that intermediate oxidation state organic s rs o and oxidized organic s ester s r oso3 accounted for 39 and 11 of total s in dbc300 and 24 and 70 of total s in dbc500 respectively these polar o containing moieties had stronger affinity to soils compared to other hydrophobic functionalities lv et al 2016 and were more preferentially adsorbed the contrasting sorption behaviors of chon and chos molecules further confirmed the occurrence of adsorptive fractionation for both dbcs and sdoc on soil 3 4 sorption mechanisms of dbcs at soil water interface once input into soils different molecules moieties of the dbcs exhibited contrasting affinity to soil components for example o rich carboxylic and phenolic moieties had high affinity to iron oxyhydroxides lv et al 2016 while aromatic moieties showed strong affinity to organic carbon chefetz and xing 2009 luo et al 2010 which caused adsorptive fractionation in their molecular compositions previous studies proposed that soil sorption mechanisms of doc include ligand exchange electrostatic interaction hydrophobic interaction and cation bridging depending on the interplay between soil properties composition and structure of doc and solution chemistry avneri katz et al 2017 gu et al 1994 jardine et al 1989 oren and chefetz 2012 the dbc sorption released over 26 new formulas in the residual doc fig 3 and s4 particularly dbc500 sorption released more new doc molecules than dbc300 sorption fig s8 these observations suggested that dbc molecules displaced small organic carbon moieties on the soil surfaces through competitive sorption the dbc500 molecules due to their high aromaticity showed high affinity to soil organic carbon and thus could primarily displace weakly bound organic carbon moieties other than hydroxyl groups on clay minerals in contrast dbc300 as a mixture rich with o rich functional groups like natural doc was prone to be adsorbed on clay surfaces by displacing hydroxyl groups that is adsorbed through ligand exchanges avneri katz et al 2017 gu et al 1994 lv et al 2016 the competitive sorption mechanisms consistent with the preferential sorption of carboxylic moieties as revealed by ft ir data fig s3 could be further confirmed by solution ph and soil surface property variations for example the solution ph increased slightly 0 5 ph unit for dbc500 while increased significantly 0 5 ph unit for dbc300 after sorption on the pristine soils which could be ascribed to the release of hydroxyl groups from soil surfaces by the dbc molecules jardine et al 1989 lv et al 2016 in the presence of dbc300 more hydroxyl groups were released and thus ph was significantly increased meanwhile the ζ potentials of the pristine soils were barely changed during the sorption at ph 6 8 in addition the micropore and mesopore as well as specific surface areas of the soils were not affected by dbc500 sorption but decreased slightly by dbc300 sorption as revealed by n2 and co2 sorption analyses fig s9 the decreased specific surface areas could be ascribed to the clogged porosity by the adsorbed dbc300 moieties through displacing parts of hydroxyl groups and small organic moieties on clay surfaces kaiser and guggenberger 2003 luo et al 2010 otherwise for example an electrostatic dominant sorption would induce decreased soil ζ potentials after adsorbed the negative moieties of dbcs luo et al 2010 lv et al 2016 the higher sorption of dbcs on the pristine soils than on the organic carbon removed soils at the low concentrations indicated that dbc molecules could be adsorbed through co flocculation co sorption with sdoc on soil surfaces besides through the ligand exchange reactions although sdoc could suppress the sorption of doc on soil because of their competition for the limited sorption sites jardine et al 1989 kaiser and zech 1997 the dbc molecules could complex with unsaturated aromatics and h saturated fractions of sdoc through π π interactions and h bond due to their aromatic moieties chefetz and xing 2009 luo et al 2014 and with oxidized moieties of sdoc through cation bridging in the presence of cations and facilitated their co sorption luo et al 2010 seifert et al 2016 xu et al 2017 the co sorption consistent with the decrease of the doc molecules with low double bond equivalency dbe number of rings plus double bonds expected for a given molecular formula 6 and high dbe 14 fig s10 after the sorption significantly decreased the overall molecular diversity of the residual doc at the soil water interface the three soils exhibited distinct adsorptive behaviors for the dbcs which could be partially attributed to their different properties for example the red soil exhibited the strongest sorption for the dbc300 because of the high affinity of iron oxyhydroxides to o rich organic moieties avneri katz et al 2017 lv et al 2016 meanwhile the red soil had weak affinity for the h saturated fractions such as lipids and proteins in the presence of dbc500 which was consistent with the weak sorption of the h saturated fractions on iron oxyhydroxides lv et al 2016 in contrast the fluvo aquic soil showed the weakest affinity to aromatics fractions of the dbc molecules fig 5 probably due to its low organic carbon and clay contents the contrasting sorption of dbc300 and dbc500 on the black soil could also be ascribed to the highest organic carbon content in the soil as stated above organic carbon has strong affinity to aromatic dbc500 while suppress the sorption of o rich dbc300 3 5 practical implications of dbc sorption at soil water environment this research offers insights on the fate of dbc input with bulk bc in soil environments and its effects on the molecular composition of doc in the received aquatic environments which have significant impacts on the quality and reactivity of doc in the environments the selective sorption of dbc on soil induces its molecular fractionation by conserving hydrophobic aromatic compounds in solutions previous studies indicated that the aromatic compounds in doc are refractory to biotic and abiotic degradation fu et al 2016 ward et al 2017 xue et al 2009 therefore the retained aromatic fractions could be translocated over long distances and finally accumulated as refractory dbc in oceanic environments aluwihare et al 2005 jaffé et al 2013 the weak sorption of the pyrogenic organic nitrogen compounds on soil implies that dissolved organic nitrogen loss through translocation from soil to aqueous phase might be much more important than previously believed jaffé et al 2013 meanwhile dbc can be much more effective more than one order of magnitude than natural doc in binding hydrophobic organic contaminant and enhancing their water solubility fu et al 2018 the enrichment of aromatic fractions of dbc after sorption on soil could therefore have important implications on organic contaminant fates for example it can bind strongly with the contaminants as sorbents and facilitate the translocation of the contaminants as carriers in the soil and water environments furthermore the phenolic and aromatic carbons as well as dissolved organic sulphur are more susceptible to photo or chemical transformation fu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 ward et al 2017 under the influence of solar irradiation or chemical oxidants these phenolic aromatic and s containing compounds can efficiently generate reactive oxygen species and thus facilitate the transformation of dbc and the associated organic contaminants fu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 thus the fractionation can facilitate the translocation and subsequent transformation of organic contaminants complexed with dbc molecules in the environments to date the refractory and degradation behaviors of pristine dbc before and after sorption on soil sediment remain largely unknown which limit our understanding of the environmental behaviors and fate of dbc in the environment further researches regarding the geo and bio reactions of the fractionated dbc during its translocation processes and its role in the transformation of c and contaminants are warranted 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the sorption of dbcs and their impacts on doc quality in soil water environment using hpsec ft ir and ft icr ms analyses based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 combined spectroscopic and mass analyses provided detailed molecular and functional information on the dbc sorption at soil water environment 2 dbc molecules were adsorbed mainly via competitive displacement and co sorption reactions at soil water environment 3 molecular fractionation occurred to doc at soil water interface during dbc sorption and o rich hydrophilic fractions of both dbc and soil doc with large molecular weight were preferentially adsorbed while the aromatic fractions were retained in aquatic phase 4 dbc sorption could induce significant molecular changes of doc decrease its molecular diversity increase its aromaticity and thus affect its reactivity at soil water interface 5 molecular fractionation also occurred to the biochar derived dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved organic sulfur during sorption at the soil water environment notes the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgments the work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos
