15450,sediment associated fe ii is a critical reductant for immobilizing groundwater contaminants such as cr vi the reduction reactivity of sediment associated fe ii is dependent on its binding environment and influenced by the biogeochemical transformation of other elements i e c n and mn challenging the description and prediction of the reactivity of fe ii in natural sediments here anaerobic batch experiments were conducted to study the variation in sediment associated fe ii reactivity toward cr vi in natural sediments collected from an intensive agricultural area located in guangxi china where nitrate is a common surface water and groundwater contaminant then a process based model was developed to describe the coupled biogeochemical processes of c n mn fe and cr in the process based model cr vi reduction by sediment associated fe ii was described using a previously developed multirate model which categorized the reactive fe ii into three fractions based on their extractabilities in sodium acetate and hcl solutions the experimental results showed that fe ii generation was inhibited by no3 and or no2 after no3 and no2 were exhausted the fe ii content and its reduction rate toward cr vi increased rapidly as the fe ii content increased the three reactive fe ii fractions exhibited approximately linear correlations with aqueous fe ii concentrations c f e 2 which was probably driven by sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium between aqueous and solid phases the model results indicated that the reaction rate constants of the three fe ii fractions kn significantly increased with incubation time and log kn correlated well with c f e 2 log k 1 2 84 c f e 2 0 17 log k 2 5 90 c f e 2 2 49 and log k 3 3 09 c f e 2 3 37 the numerical model developed in this study provides an applicable method to describe and predict cr vi removal from groundwater under dynamic redox conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater contamination cr vi removal sediment associated fe ii reaction kinetics process based model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural sediments contain a variety of fe bearing minerals including fe oxyhydr oxides and clay minerals stucki et al 2012 fe occurs in two redox states fe ii and fe iii redox transformation between fe ii and fe iii has a significant impact on other redox sensitive elements kappler et al 2021 for example fe ii is a natural reductant that plays an important role in the transport and fate of groundwater metals and contaminants such as cr vi as v tc vii and u vi brookshaw et al 2015 whitaker et al 2018 since natural sediments contain various fe ii species including aqueous fe ii sorbed fe ii and other solid forms of fe ii hofstetter et al 2003 they exhibit diverse reactive properties based on fe ii speciation and availability brookshaw et al 2016 fredrickson et al 2004 whitaker et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 consequently redox cycling of fe ii and fe iii and the heterogeneous reactivity of fe ii pose a significant challenge for determining and scaling the geochemical reaction parameters of sediments from laboratory to field scale applications especially under temporally and spatially varying redox conditions ginn et al 2017 joe wong et al 2017 qafoku et al 2017 xu et al 2018 the reactivity of fe ii containing sediment toward the reduction of cr vi a common groundwater contaminant found naturally and from industrial wastes gorny et al 2016 yan et al 2022 has been intensively studied because cr vi reductive immobilization to cr iii is an effective groundwater remediation method bishop et al 2019 joe wong et al 2017 owing to the complexity of fe ii speciation in natural sediments the reported cr vi reduction rates in natural sediments varied from 0 05 to 5 mg 1 g 1 h 1 cr vi reduction rates were normalized by fe content in the sediments jung et al 2020 xu et al 2018 2017 implying large uncertainty in sediment associated fe ii reactivity in our previous studies a multirate model was proposed to describe fe ii reactivity toward cr vi reduction in natural sediments liu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 the multirate model assumes that the reaction in a sediment can be described by linearly adding the reactions of individual rate fractions of fe ii since it is extremely difficult to characterize all the reactive fe ii species in natural sediments a three step sequential extraction method was developed to categorize the reactive fe ii into three fractions based on fe ii extractabilities in sodium acetate and hcl solutions xu et al 2018 the model well described cr vi reduction in different natural sediments collected from the columbia river hyporheic zone at the hanford site in washington usa in natural sediments the sequential nature of electron acceptor utilization by microorganisms results in variation in redox conditions thus influencing redox cycling of fe ii and fe iii ferris et al 2021 under anoxic conditions fe transformation in natural sediments is tightly coupled with other elements such as c n and mn through complex biogeochemical processes kappler et al 2021 tian et al 2020 fe ii can be enzymatically oxidized coupled with nitrate reduction by nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizing bacteria klueglein et al 2013 and chemically oxidized by mn oxyhydr oxides madison et al 2013 nitrate and mn oxyhydr oxides have higher redox potentials eh than fe iii and would be preferentially utilized as terminal electron acceptors by microorganisms from a thermodynamic point of view bhanja et al 2019 in either way nitrate and mn oxyhydr oxides might inhibit or compete with fe iii reduction and have an indirect effect on the redox reactivity of the sediments for example the longevity of the in situ redox manipulation groundwater barrier which was installed at the hanford site in washington usa to prevent migration of groundwater cr vi via its reduction by fe ii generated in the barrier was reduced by 50 due to the presence of nitrate in the groundwater szecsody et al 2005 therefore extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the coupled biogeochemical processes of c n fe and mn chen et al 2020 lin and taillefert 2014 madison et al 2013 and a few studies have developed numerical models to describe their coupled reaction kinetics under different scenarios bhanja et al 2019 liu et al 2017 van bodegom and scholten 2001 wang and choi 2013 although the influence of coupled biogeochemical processes on fe transformation has attracted much attention little is known about how the reactive fe ii fractions proposed in the multirate model change with fe transformation limiting the field applications of the model freshly biogenic fe ii interacts with sediments through sorption of fe ii electron transfer and fe atom exchange between sorbed fe ii and structural fe iii and mineral phase transformation latta et al 2012 as such redistribution of freshly generated fe ii should influence the reactive fe ii speciation in the sediments previous studies have suggested that fe ii reactivity represented as reaction rate or rate constant in aqueous fe ii fe oxyhrdr oxide suspensions correlated with the density of the bounded fe ii and the fe oxyhrdr oxide species amonette et al 2000 consequently the redistribution of biogenic fe ii could change the reactivity of sediment associated fe ii a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that the values of log k of the bounded fe ii are linearly correlated with the free energy of the electron transfer reaction Î´r g which is correlated with the eh of the bounded fe ii if electron transfer occurs preceding the rate limiting step to reach equilibrium stewart et al 2018 moreover eh is approximately linearly correlated with log c f e 2 if thermodynamic equilibria such as sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium are achieved gorski et al 2016 to date such good correlations have been reported only in simple systems such as redox reactions between fe ii fe oxyhydr oxide and soluble electron transfer meditators the two assumptions may not be valid for cr vi reduction in natural sediments thus it is necessary to investigate how anoxic fe transformation influences sediment associated reactive fe ii speciation in sediments and whether the redistribution of biogenic fe ii changes the reactivity of fe ii toward cr vi in this study sediments collected from a river corridor along the zhenlong river in hengxian guangxi china were used as an example to investigate the kinetics of fe ii reactivity toward cr vi in natural sediments during the coupled biogeochemical transformation of n mn fe and c under anaerobic conditions the study site is located in an intensive agricultural area where nitrate is a common natural water pollutant and some soils and sediments are contaminated with cr shen et al 2019 yang et al 2021 anaerobic incubation experiments were conducted to investigate the dominant biogeochemical processes in the sediments and their kinetics during incubation a three step sequential extraction method was used to determine the variation in fe ii fractions then cr vi reduction experiments were conducted to characterize the variation in reactivities of the three fe ii fractions eventually a process based model was developed to simulate the kinetics of the three fe ii fractions and the variation in their reactivity toward cr vi reduction under varying redox conditions the results were compared with those in sediments from the hanford site to provide new insights into the dynamic reduction reactivity of fe ii toward cr vi in natural sediments and the model developed in this study is applicable to describe and predict cr vi reduction in natural sediments under varying redox conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site sediment sampling and sample characterization the study site is located in an intensive agricultural area in hengxian county guangxi province china fig 1 details of the geological and chemical features of the study area are provided in text s1 in 2017 uncontaminated sediment samples were collected upstream of the zhenlong river near dengxu town to investigate the biogeochemical reaction kinetics that influence the fate of cr sediment samples were collected from 11 sampling points fig 1 at which point three subsamples 250 g in weight and 0 20 cm in depth were collected mixed and transported to the lab on ice all sediment samples were broken up with a rubber hammer and sieved to 2 mm an equal weight 500 g of the 11 sieved surface sediments was homogenized and the composite sediment was stored at 4 c for further usage the physical and chemical properties of the composite sediment sample were analyzed the ph was measured in a suspension with a 1 2 m v sediment to deionized water ratio the grain sizes were determined by wet sieving stoliker et al 2013 the mineral composition was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd text s2 and the total organic carbon toc was detected using an element analyzer ecs 4024 chnso costech italy the total mn content total reducible fe nh4 oxalate extractable and total sediment associated reactive fe ii hcl extractable were chemically extracted and determined text s2 the acid volatile sulfide avs concentration was determined using a purge and trap method text s2 the reagents used in this study were purchased from aladdin or macklin 2 2 laboratory experiments anaerobic batch experiments were performed in glass serum bottles sealed with rubber stoppers each experiment was conducted in triplicate in an anoxic chamber vigor sg2400 750ts f and the bottles were shaken in a thermostatic oscillator 150 r dlhr q200 o2 free synthetic river water srw was prepared to mimic the ion concentrations in the surface water in the study area text s3 and table s1 2 2 1 coupled biogeochemical transformation of n mn and fe approximately 300 g of the sediments was suspended in 300 ml o2 free srw in 500 ml glass serum bottles in a constant temperature vibrator dlhr q200 for 20 days at 25 2 c the bottles were shaken in the dark at a speed of 150 rpm at selected times 30 ml of the sediment suspensions was sampled and centrifuged for 30 min at 7830 r eppendorf centrifuge 5430 the supernatant was used to determine aqueous nitrate nitrite ammonium fe ii and mn concentrations text s4 the pellet was divided into two halves one half was extracted with kcl 2 m kcl for 2 h to measure the exchangeable ammonium in the sediments kempers and zweers 1986 and the other half was used to quantify sediment associated fe ii species using a three step sequential extraction method designed for the characterization of reactive fe ii speciation toward cr vi the three fractions of fe ii were named fractions 1 2 and 3 xu et al 2018 the details of the analytical methods are provided in text s4 2 2 2 kinetics of cr vi reduction four sets of anaerobic batch experiments were performed to investigate cr vi reduction mechanisms and to study cr vi reduction kinetics under different redox conditions the first set of experiments was performed to assess whether the composite sediment could immobilize cr vi approximately 8 g sediment sample was suspended in 100 ml o2 free srw in a 135 ml bottle the sediment suspension was spiked with 5 mm cr vi stock solution k2cro4 ar macklin to achieve the desired initial cr vi concentration 20 Î¼m the bottles were shaken at 25 2 c for 20 days at selected times approximately 5 ml of the suspension was sampled and filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m mixed cellulose ester mce syringe filter xinya the cr vi concentration in the filtrate was colorimetrically quantified using the diphenylcarbazide method brookshaw et al 2014 control experiments were conducted without sediments the second set of experiments was performed to investigate the contribution of microbial respiration to cr vi reduction since microbial activities would be suppressed by autoclaving and high temperature lovley and phillips 1988a cr vi reduction kinetics were performed in autoclaved sediments at 25 2 c and in pristine sediments at 60 2 c in a constant temperature vibrator dlhr q200 to prepare the autoclaved sediments 8 g sediments were suspended in 100 ml o2 free srw in sealed serum bottles autoclaved at 122 c for 20 min and cooled to 25 2 c before cr vi spike cr vi reduction in pristine sediments was performed with the same sediment water ratio 8 g 100 ml the initial cr vi concentrations were approximately 20 Î¼m the third set of experiments was conducted to evaluate the potential contribution of organic carbon oc to cr vi reduction the sediment and srw were mixed at a ratio of 1 2 m v for 2 h to extract oc and then the suspensions were centrifuged and filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m ptfe syringe filter jinteng the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using toc l cpn shimadzu japan after autoclaving at 122 c for 20 min 60 ml filtrate was adjusted to ph 8 2 and spiked with cr vi stock solution to achieve an initial concentration of 20 Î¼m the cr vi concentration in the solution was monitored at selected sampling times at 25 2 c the last set of experiments was to evaluate cr reduction kinetics in preincubated sediments because anaerobic microbial respiration can produce reducing agents such as fe ii or sulfide brookshaw et al 2014 smillie et al 1981 in 2017 sediment suspensions 50 g sediments 100 ml o2 free srw were incubated in the dark at 25 2 c during incubation the avs content of the suspensions was occasionally monitored after 10 and 20 days of incubation the suspensions were centrifuged at 7830 r for 30 min to separate the supernatant from the pellet the aqueous fe ii concentration in the supernatant and three sediment associated fe ii fractions were measured then approximately 8 g of the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml o2 free srw cr vi reduction kinetic experiments were carried out by spiking cr vi stock solution into different initial cr vi concentrations at 25 2 c after cr vi reduction experiments in sediments incubated for 20 days were completed the suspensions were centrifuged to collect the pellet and a strong alkaline solution 0 5 m naoh and 0 28 m na2co3 was used to extract cr vi that might have been adsorbed on the sediments graham et al 2009 in 2022 an additional cr vi reduction kinetic experiment was conducted in sediment preincubated for 46 days the details of the additional kinetic experiment are provided in text s5 2 3 numerical model framework a process based biogeochemical model was developed to describe the coupled biogeochemical transformation of c n mn fe and cr and the variation in fe ii reactivities toward cr vi reduction the model framework is summarized as follows 1 the dominant processes were identified from the kinetic experimental results and literature study and processes with less impact on the elemental transformation were ignored 2 appropriate reaction kinetic equations were chosen for the proposed processes 3 kinematic differential equations for all the chemical species were constructed and numerically solved with the explicit discretization method using matlab r2021a and 4 the parameters were fitted by a trial and error method using the experimental results obtained in 2017 and the variances of the parameters were estimated using the jacobian matrix and covariance matrix of the measurement errors the results obtained in 2022 were not used to calibrate the parameters of the model for three reasons 1 microorganisms continuously changed the chemical and biological properties of the sediment during the 5 years of storage 2 we were not able to characterize the initial chemical and biological properties of the aged sediment because the rest of the sediment was limited and 3 46 days was far beyond the experimental time scale in 2017 20 days and no replication was conducted to evaluate the validity of the result due to the limited sediment therefore the results obtained in 2022 were only used to evaluate the applicability and scope of the correlation between cr vi reduction rate constants and aqueous fe ii concentrations developed from the experimental results obtained in 2017 the details of the model development are discussed in section 3 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment properties and cr vi immobilization pathways in the sediment the sediment properties including ph mineralogy and grain size are provided in text s6 the toc content was high 2 88 0 25 due to agricultural activities the total mn content was 2 99 1 95 Î¼mol g the reducible fe content was 40 44 25 49 Î¼mol g the concentrations of the total sediment associated reactive fe ii ranged from 2 30 to 6 48 Î¼mol g due to the strong heterogeneity of the sediments the concentration of avs was near the detection limit 5 Î¼m implying the absence of avs an approach adopted from a previous study was used to identify the processes controlling cr vi immobilization in the sediments text s7 xu et al 2017 the results indicated that cr vi reduction by fe ii was the dominant immobilization mechanism which is consistent with previous reports that fe ii is the dominant reductant for cr vi at ph values greater than 5 5 fendorf et al 2000 xu et al 2017 in addition cr vi adsorption made a small contribution to cr vi immobilization 3 2 influence of coupled biogeochemical transformation of c n and mn on fe ii generation the nitrate concentration declined rapidly within 4 days fig 2 a meanwhile the nitrite concentration increased to 1 83 mm and diminished rapidly after nitrate was exhausted indicating that nitrite reduction was inhibited by nitrate glass and silverstein 1998 yan et al 2016 both aqueous and exchangeable ammonium increased with incubation time fig 2b many biogeochemical processes could be involved in n transformation covatti and grischek 2021 kuypers et al 2018 nitrate reduction may result from denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and assimilatory nitrate reduction processes nitrite generation and consumption may result from denitrification dnra assimilatory nitrate reduction and anammox processes the generation and consumption of aqueous and exchangeable ammonium may result from dnra nitrogen fixation anammox microbial consumption by microbial growth through assimilatory processes decomposition of microbes degradation of oc and ion exchange of ammonium processes theoretical calculation of reduction potentials for nitrate mn iv and fe iii suggested that nitrate should be reduced prior to mn iv reduction and mn iv reduction prior to fe iii reduction bhanja et al 2019 our results were partly in agreement with the theory the aqueous mn ii concentration continuously increased from 0 009 mm to 0 103 mm during 20 days of anaerobic incubation fig 2c meanwhile aqueous and sediment associated fe ii did not accumulate until nitrate and nitrite were exhausted fig 3 a although some studies reported inhibition of microbial mn iv reduction by nitrate dollhopf et al 2000 nealson and myers 1992 mn iv reduction in this study was not or at least not completely suppressed by nitrate and or nitrite in contrast nitrate and or nitrite can completely inhibit fe ii generation by competing for electrons with fe iii reduction or oxidizing fe ii through biotic and abiotic pathways dollhopf et al 2000 kappler et al 2021 the competition or inhibition relationship between mn iii iv and fe iii reductions is still under debate some studies indicate that mn iv can completely or partly inhibit fe ii generation through mn iv oxidation of fe ii lovley and phillips 1988b van bodegom and scholten 2001 but others report simultaneous reduction of mn iv and fe iii lin and taillefert 2014 peters and conrad 1996 in this study no inhibition of mn iv reduction on fe iii reduction was observed probably because mn iv and fe iii were solid substrates to which microbial access controlled the reduction process 3 3 the variation in three reactive fe ii fractions with fe transformation the variation in reactive fe ii fractions of the sediments was characterized with a three step extraction method table 1 and fig 3b the pristine sediments were exposed to air so that some of the reactive fe ii should already be oxidized as shown in table 1 the most reactive fe ii fraction 1 was absent in the pristine sediments a small amount of reactive fe ii was grouped in fraction 2 0 29 0 05 Î¼mol g and the majority of reactive fe ii was grouped in fraction 3 2 04 0 18 Î¼mol g the absence of fraction 1 indicated that this fraction was more easily oxidized in air than the other two fractions during anaerobic incubation after nitrate was exhausted both aqueous and sediment associated fe ii concentrations increased with incubation time fig 3a meanwhile all three reactive fe ii fractions increased with time fraction 1 increased most rapidly fraction 2 increased most slowly and the rate of generation of fraction 3 was between the other two fractions fig 3b thermodynamic equilibria such as sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium can drive the redistribution of freshly biogenic fe ii between the aqueous phase and solid phase gorski et al 2016 therefore each fraction of sediment associated fe ii was plotted against c f e 2 fig 3c the three fractions exhibited approximately linear correlations with c f e 2 with r2 values of 0 97 for fraction 1 p 0 01 0 77 for fraction 2 p 0 01 and 0 54 for fraction 3 p 0 01 the good correlation confirmed the tendency of freshly biogenic fe ii to reach sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium between aqueous fe ii and sediment associated fe ii the r2 value for fraction 3 was smaller than that for the other two fractions probably because fraction 3 was calculated from the difference between hcl extractable fe ii and sodium acetate extractable fe ii which were determined from parallel sediment samples sediment heterogeneity led to large uncertainty in fraction 3 autoclave is often used to sterilize sediments however the total sediment associated reactive fe ii increased from 2 33 0 23 Î¼mol g to 7 17 0 82 Î¼mol g after autoclaving table 1 the reactive fe ii fractions also changed reactive fe ii in fractions 1 and 3 increased and that in fraction 2 disappeared table 1 although the underlying reasons are unclear a possible explanation could be that high temperature and pressure destroyed or altered the structure and phase of fe bearing minerals thus releasing incorporated solid form fe ii and new thermodynamic equilibria led to different fe ii speciation regenspurg et al 2002 since autoclaves influenced the amount and speciation of reactive fe ii in the sediments other sterilization methods should be considered 3 4 cr vi reduction in sediments containing variable reactive fe ii fractions the reactivity of sediment associated fe ii toward cr vi was evaluated using cr vi reduction in sediments containing variable fe ii fractions the pristine sediment was able to remove approximately 30 of cr vi spiked into the sediment suspension after 70 h fig 4 a as expected cr vi reduction rates in the preincubated sediments significantly increased compared to those in the pristine sediments fig 4 b d due to the increase in the three reactive fe ii fractions table 1 a previous study reported that cr vi reduction rates in pristine sediments and autoclaved sediments were the same for sediments from the hanford site usa unexpectedly in this study cr vi removal in autoclaved sediments was significantly faster than that in pristine sediments fig 4a because the total sediment associated reactive fe ii and most reactive fe ii fraction fraction 1 increased table 1 in general the variation in reactive fe ii fractions well explained the difference in cr vi reduction rates in the four sediments 3 5 development of the process based model first n transformation processes were simplified the reasons to simplify the n transformation processes are provided in text s8 in summary nitrate reduction to nitrite nitrite reduction to n2 the degradation of particulate organic carbon poc as the source of ammonium and doc and ion exchange of ammonium between the aqueous and solid phases were considered in this study table 2 r1 r4 inhibition of nitrite reduction by nitrate has been widely reported glass and silverstein 1998 cr vi is toxic to many soil microorganisms that can function in n mn and fe transformation ross et al 1981 thus the inhibition of nitrate on r2 and cr vi on r1 and r2 should be considered the reaction kinetics of nitrate and nitrite reduction degradation of poc and ion exchange of ammonium can be described using the following equations yan et al 2016 zarnetske et al 2012 1 r i i i q i x j c j k s r i j c j 2 i i k k i k r i k i k r i c k 3 r 3 k poc q poc 4 r i Î± i q j k d j c j where ri is the reaction rate of process i ii is the inhibition term k i k r i is the inhibition coefficient for chemical species k in reaction i qi is the

j in reaction i qj is the solid content of chemical species j kpoc is the degradation rate for poc k d j is the distribution coefficient of chemical species j between solid and aqueous phases and Î±i is the first order mass transfer coefficient of chemical species j between solid and aqueous phases the mn content in the sediments was much lower than that of reducible fe 2 99 1 95 Î¼mol g vs 40 44 25 49 Î¼mol g and the influence of mn transformation on fe transformation was small figs 2c and 3a thus the complex transformation of mn was not considered in this study only microbial reduction of mn iv was considered because this process competes with microbial fe iii reduction for doc microbial reduction of mn iv and fe iii table 2 r5 and r6 can be described using eq 5 van bodegom and scholten 2001 5 r i i i q i x q i j c j k s r i j c j where qi is the reducible fe and mn contents in the sediments the inhibition of mn iv and fe iii reduction by nitrate and cr vi was considered in the model using eq 2 the biogenic fe ii was redistributed to three reactive fe ii fractions driven by sorptive and redox equilibrium table 2 r7 the redistribution of biogenic fe ii can be described using eqs 4 and 6 6 c f e 2 swr n 1 3 q f e i i n c fe ii where c fe ii is the total sediment associated reactive fe ii concentration which includes aqueous fe ii c f e 2 and the three fractions of sediment associated fe ii fractions q fe ii n cr vi adsorption table 2 r8 was described using eq 4 and cr vi reduction table 2 r9 was described using a saturation type model published elsewhere sorwat et al

in reaction Ñ table 2 the initial concentrations of fe iii and poc were assumed to be the reducible fe and toc contents in the sediments the initial concentration of mn iv was the total mn content multiplied by an activity coefficient Î·i because the majority of the sediment mn is not microbially available lovley 1991 the initial doc concentration was estimated from the oc concentration extracted from the sediments 0 44 mm the initial concentrations of n species no3 no2 nh4 exchangeable nh4 aqueous fe ii and mn ii and sediment associated fe ii fractions were measured for each experiment biomass was estimated from a common soil cell density 4 5 107 cells g sediment bickel and or 2020 raynaud and nunan 2014 and the typical cell weight 10 12 g cell yan et al 2016 the parameters used in the study and reported in previous studies are compared in table s3 some parameters were adopted from the literature for example half saturation constants for doc and nitrite k s r i doc and k s r 2 no 2 and the inhibition coefficient of cr vi on microbial activity k i cr vi the distribution coefficients for reactive fe ii fractions k d sed fe ii were the slope of the linear regression between sediment associated fe ii fractions and aqueous fe ii concentrations fig 3c distribution coefficients for ammonium and cr vi k d nh 4 and k d cr vi were calculated from the ratio between simultaneously monitored concentrations of their soil and aqueous species assuming that adsorption and iron exchange kinetics were faster than redox reactions other parameters were fitted by matching the simulated results to the experimental results figs 2 4 first the coupled biogeochemical transformation of n mn fe and c was fitted then these parameters were used to fit cr vi immobilization in sediments under variable redox conditions the goodness of the model fit was evaluated by minimizing the root mean square relative error rmsre l n s 1 c l c l 2 n s where c is the simulated value and ns is the total number of samples li and sun 2020 the variances for the estimated parameters were evaluated using the jacobian matrix and covariance matrix of the measurement errors text s9 in general the process based model well described the coupled biogeochemical transformation of n mn fe c and cr figs 2 4 there was a discrepancy between the simulated and experimental nitrite production and reduction kinetics fig 2a this discrepancy indicated that some biogeochemical processes might be missed such as anammox nitrate reducing fe ii oxidation and variation in the expression of nitrate and nitrite reductase klueglein et al 2013 kuypers et al 2018 tian et al 2020 since the influence of nitrite reaction kinetics on the reactivity of fe ii was small nitrite reaction kinetics were not a focus of this study not all the parameters were well constrained table s3 in general the rate constants q and most of the kn distribution coefficients kd and mass transfer coefficients Î± were well constrained the rate constants for fractions 3 in the sediments exhibited large uncertainties because the reduction rates for fractions 3 were too slow the degradation rate for poc kpoc and the stoichiometric coefficient of nh4 releasement due to poc degradation Î³ nh 4 also exhibited large uncertainties because the model lacked experimental data of poc degradation to constrain the parameter estimation other parameters containing large uncertainties included half saturation constants ks and inhibition factors ki unsurprisingly it has been proven that kinetic parameters in the saturation type models are linearly correlated so that the relative standard deviation of correlated parameters Ï Î¸m Î¸m could be as large as 80 depending on experimental conditions liu and zachara 2001 3 6 variation in fe ii reactivity toward cr vi in natural sediments the average rate constants k n f n k n where fn is the percentage of the reactive fe ii fractions for cr vi reduction by sediments from dengxu and hanford xu et al 2018 are plotted against c f e 2 in fig 5 a the k for sediments with low c f e 2 dengxu sediments without preincubation and hanford sediments preincubated for up to 40 days varied by 2 orders of magnitude due to the differences in reactive fe ii fractions fn however using the multirate model the difference in kn for sediments with low c f e 2 was only 2 times kn in table s3 although dengxu and hanford sediments had different reactive fe ii speciation mineralogy organic matter contents and microbial communities the similar values of kn for sediments with low c f e 2 verified the applicability of the three step sequential extraction method for the characterization of reactive fe ii fractions in natural sediments interestingly the values of kn for dengxu sediments increased with the preincubation time of the sediments fig 5b the rate constants for fractions 1 and 2 k1 and k2 in the sediment preincubated for 46 days could not be constrained by the experimental data because the cr vi reduction rate was extremely fast at the beginning of the experiment fig 4d approximately 640 Î¼m cr vi was removed from the aqueous phase within 7 min when we took the first sample reduction of 640 Î¼m cr vi would consume 35 Î¼mol g fe ii which is more than reactive fe ii grouped in fraction 1 27 03 Î¼mol g and close to the sum of reactive fe ii in fractions 1 and 2 39 03 Î¼mol g table 1 the mass balance calculation suggested that fractions 1 and 2 were oxidized before our first sampling consequently only the rate constant for fraction 3 k3 in the sediment preincubated for 46 days was well constrained by the experimental data an increase in kn with preincubation time was not observed in our previous studies conducted at the hanford site liu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 2017 the difference between the two studies is that aqueous fe ii accumulated during preincubation for dengxu sediments fig 3a while no aqueous fe ii was detected in hanford sediments up to 20 days preincubation and aqueous fe ii was barely detected until 40 days preincubation the values of kn for dengxu sediments preincubated for 0 10 20 and 46 days were plotted against c f e 2 measured at the same time fig 5c surprisingly the values of log kn approximately linearly correlated with c f e 2 with r2 0 98 table 1 the linear correlation between log ki and c f e 2 for fraction 1 and fraction 2 was statistically significant at the level of p 0 05 the linear correlation between log k3 and c f e 2 was statistically significant at the level of p 0 01 note that the linear correlation between log k3 and c f e 2 using the data obtained in 2017 was not statistically significant p 0 21 because there were only 3 data points and the variances of k3 were too large by adding one more data point the p value for fraction 3 could be improved from 0 21 to 0 01 previous studies in aqueous fe ii fe oxyhydr oxide systems have shown that log k linearly correlates with the eh of the system and eh linearly correlates with log c f e 2 gorski et al 2016 stewart et al 2018 thus theoretically log k should be linearly correlated with log c f e 2 the theoretical relationship is deduced based on two assumptions 1 electron transfer occurs preceding the rate limiting step reach equilibrium stewart et al 2018 and 2 thermodynamic equilibria such as sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium are achieved gorski et al 2016 however these assumptions may not be valid for cr vi reduction in natural sediments first cr vi reduction is a three electron reaction so the first assumption may not be valid second achieving thermodynamic equilibrium is difficult in natural sediments because of the physical heterogeneity in microstructures and chemical heterogeneity in fe bearing minerals and other redox pairs a previous study showed that the correlation between eh and c f e 2 in natural sediments was complicated peters and conrad 1996 reanalysis of the data from this study text s10 indicated that eh linearly correlated better with log c f e 2 for some sediments and eh linearly correlated better with c f e 2 for other sediments if the sediments were incubated for a long time 40 70 days piecewise functions should be used to describe the correlation between eh and c f e 2 therefore we propose the following equation to estimate the variation in kn during anaerobic incubation 9 log k n a c f e 2 b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the linear regression for log kn and aqueous fe ii concentrations as disused above eq 9 is an empirical model that should be used with caution nevertheless this empirical model is supported by thermodynamic relationships and the values of kn estimated by this model are less influenced by the coupled biogeochemical transformation of c n and mn for example biogenic fe ii was inhibited by nitrate and nitrite thus influencing the variation in kn with incubation time fig 5b in contrast the delay of fe ii generation would not influence the correlation between log kn and c f e 2 4 conclusions a process based model was developed to describe the influence of coupled biogeochemical processes on the variation in reactivity of sediment associated fe ii toward cr vi reduction the model was used to investigate cr vi reduction rates in natural sediments from dengxu china and hanford usa the average reduction rate constants k for cr vi reduction by reactive fe ii in different sediments varied by more than 4 orders of magnitude the large variation in fe ii reactivity in the sediments was attributed to the difference in reactive fe ii speciation and reactivity under different redox conditions sediment associated fe ii can be grouped into three fractions fn with different redox rate constants kn in a multirate model using this model the variation in kn for different sediments was significantly reduced under anaerobic conditions reactive fe ii generation was influenced by the coupled biogeochemical transformation of c n and mn for example the presence of nitrate and nitrite inhibited fe ii generation and the competition between microbially driven elemental transformations for organic carbon also influenced fe ii generation kinetics the freshly biogenic fe ii in dengxu sediments was redistributed in the sediments resulting in a significant increase in the three reactive fe ii fractions and their reactivities kn the values of log kn were approximately linearly correlated with c f e 2 the reactivities kn for freshly biogenic fe ii in hanford sediments during up to 40 days of anaerobic incubation did not significantly increase as aqueous fe ii barely accumulated in hanford sediments the model framework developed in this study is able to describe and predict cr vi reduction kinetics in natural sediments where spatial and temporal chemical and biological heterogeneities lead to large variations in fe

15450,sediment associated fe ii is a critical reductant for immobilizing groundwater contaminants such as cr vi the reduction reactivity of sediment associated fe ii is dependent on its binding environment and influenced by the biogeochemical transformation of other elements i e c n and mn challenging the description and prediction of the reactivity of fe ii in natural sediments here anaerobic batch experiments were conducted to study the variation in sediment associated fe ii reactivity toward cr vi in natural sediments collected from an intensive agricultural area located in guangxi china where nitrate is a common surface water and groundwater contaminant then a process based model was developed to describe the coupled biogeochemical processes of c n mn fe and cr in the process based model cr vi reduction by sediment associated fe ii was described using a previously developed multirate model which categorized the reactive fe ii into three fractions based on their extractabilities in sodium acetate and hcl solutions the experimental results showed that fe ii generation was inhibited by no3 and or no2 after no3 and no2 were exhausted the fe ii content and its reduction rate toward cr vi increased rapidly as the fe ii content increased the three reactive fe ii fractions exhibited approximately linear correlations with aqueous fe ii concentrations c f e 2 which was probably driven by sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium between aqueous and solid phases the model results indicated that the reaction rate constants of the three fe ii fractions kn significantly increased with incubation time and log kn correlated well with c f e 2 log k 1 2 84 c f e 2 0 17 log k 2 5 90 c f e 2 2 49 and log k 3 3 09 c f e 2 3 37 the numerical model developed in this study provides an applicable method to describe and predict cr vi removal from groundwater under dynamic redox conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater contamination cr vi removal sediment associated fe ii reaction kinetics process based model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural sediments contain a variety of fe bearing minerals including fe oxyhydr oxides and clay minerals stucki et al 2012 fe occurs in two redox states fe ii and fe iii redox transformation between fe ii and fe iii has a significant impact on other redox sensitive elements kappler et al 2021 for example fe ii is a natural reductant that plays an important role in the transport and fate of groundwater metals and contaminants such as cr vi as v tc vii and u vi brookshaw et al 2015 whitaker et al 2018 since natural sediments contain various fe ii species including aqueous fe ii sorbed fe ii and other solid forms of fe ii hofstetter et al 2003 they exhibit diverse reactive properties based on fe ii speciation and availability brookshaw et al 2016 fredrickson et al 2004 whitaker et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 consequently redox cycling of fe ii and fe iii and the heterogeneous reactivity of fe ii pose a significant challenge for determining and scaling the geochemical reaction parameters of sediments from laboratory to field scale applications especially under temporally and spatially varying redox conditions ginn et al 2017 joe wong et al 2017 qafoku et al 2017 xu et al 2018 the reactivity of fe ii containing sediment toward the reduction of cr vi a common groundwater contaminant found naturally and from industrial wastes gorny et al 2016 yan et al 2022 has been intensively studied because cr vi reductive immobilization to cr iii is an effective groundwater remediation method bishop et al 2019 joe wong et al 2017 owing to the complexity of fe ii speciation in natural sediments the reported cr vi reduction rates in natural sediments varied from 0 05 to 5 mg 1 g 1 h 1 cr vi reduction rates were normalized by fe content in the sediments jung et al 2020 xu et al 2018 2017 implying large uncertainty in sediment associated fe ii reactivity in our previous studies a multirate model was proposed to describe fe ii reactivity toward cr vi reduction in natural sediments liu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 the multirate model assumes that the reaction in a sediment can be described by linearly adding the reactions of individual rate fractions of fe ii since it is extremely difficult to characterize all the reactive fe ii species in natural sediments a three step sequential extraction method was developed to categorize the reactive fe ii into three fractions based on fe ii extractabilities in sodium acetate and hcl solutions xu et al 2018 the model well described cr vi reduction in different natural sediments collected from the columbia river hyporheic zone at the hanford site in washington usa in natural sediments the sequential nature of electron acceptor utilization by microorganisms results in variation in redox conditions thus influencing redox cycling of fe ii and fe iii ferris et al 2021 under anoxic conditions fe transformation in natural sediments is tightly coupled with other elements such as c n and mn through complex biogeochemical processes kappler et al 2021 tian et al 2020 fe ii can be enzymatically oxidized coupled with nitrate reduction by nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizing bacteria klueglein et al 2013 and chemically oxidized by mn oxyhydr oxides madison et al 2013 nitrate and mn oxyhydr oxides have higher redox potentials eh than fe iii and would be preferentially utilized as terminal electron acceptors by microorganisms from a thermodynamic point of view bhanja et al 2019 in either way nitrate and mn oxyhydr oxides might inhibit or compete with fe iii reduction and have an indirect effect on the redox reactivity of the sediments for example the longevity of the in situ redox manipulation groundwater barrier which was installed at the hanford site in washington usa to prevent migration of groundwater cr vi via its reduction by fe ii generated in the barrier was reduced by 50 due to the presence of nitrate in the groundwater szecsody et al 2005 therefore extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the coupled biogeochemical processes of c n fe and mn chen et al 2020 lin and taillefert 2014 madison et al 2013 and a few studies have developed numerical models to describe their coupled reaction kinetics under different scenarios bhanja et al 2019 liu et al 2017 van bodegom and scholten 2001 wang and choi 2013 although the influence of coupled biogeochemical processes on fe transformation has attracted much attention little is known about how the reactive fe ii fractions proposed in the multirate model change with fe transformation limiting the field applications of the model freshly biogenic fe ii interacts with sediments through sorption of fe ii electron transfer and fe atom exchange between sorbed fe ii and structural fe iii and mineral phase transformation latta et al 2012 as such redistribution of freshly generated fe ii should influence the reactive fe ii speciation in the sediments previous studies have suggested that fe ii reactivity represented as reaction rate or rate constant in aqueous fe ii fe oxyhrdr oxide suspensions correlated with the density of the bounded fe ii and the fe oxyhrdr oxide species amonette et al 2000 consequently the redistribution of biogenic fe ii could change the reactivity of sediment associated fe ii a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that the values of log k of the bounded fe ii are linearly correlated with the free energy of the electron transfer reaction Î´r g which is correlated with the eh of the bounded fe ii if electron transfer occurs preceding the rate limiting step to reach equilibrium stewart et al 2018 moreover eh is approximately linearly correlated with log c f e 2 if thermodynamic equilibria such as sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium are achieved gorski et al 2016 to date such good correlations have been reported only in simple systems such as redox reactions between fe ii fe oxyhydr oxide and soluble electron transfer meditators the two assumptions may not be valid for cr vi reduction in natural sediments thus it is necessary to investigate how anoxic fe transformation influences sediment associated reactive fe ii speciation in sediments and whether the redistribution of biogenic fe ii changes the reactivity of fe ii toward cr vi in this study sediments collected from a river corridor along the zhenlong river in hengxian guangxi china were used as an example to investigate the kinetics of fe ii reactivity toward cr vi in natural sediments during the coupled biogeochemical transformation of n mn fe and c under anaerobic conditions the study site is located in an intensive agricultural area where nitrate is a common natural water pollutant and some soils and sediments are contaminated with cr shen et al 2019 yang et al 2021 anaerobic incubation experiments were conducted to investigate the dominant biogeochemical processes in the sediments and their kinetics during incubation a three step sequential extraction method was used to determine the variation in fe ii fractions then cr vi reduction experiments were conducted to characterize the variation in reactivities of the three fe ii fractions eventually a process based model was developed to simulate the kinetics of the three fe ii fractions and the variation in their reactivity toward cr vi reduction under varying redox conditions the results were compared with those in sediments from the hanford site to provide new insights into the dynamic reduction reactivity of fe ii toward cr vi in natural sediments and the model developed in this study is applicable to describe and predict cr vi reduction in natural sediments under varying redox conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site sediment sampling and sample characterization the study site is located in an intensive agricultural area in hengxian county guangxi province china fig 1 details of the geological and chemical features of the study area are provided in text s1 in 2017 uncontaminated sediment samples were collected upstream of the zhenlong river near dengxu town to investigate the biogeochemical reaction kinetics that influence the fate of cr sediment samples were collected from 11 sampling points fig 1 at which point three subsamples 250 g in weight and 0 20 cm in depth were collected mixed and transported to the lab on ice all sediment samples were broken up with a rubber hammer and sieved to 2 mm an equal weight 500 g of the 11 sieved surface sediments was homogenized and the composite sediment was stored at 4 c for further usage the physical and chemical properties of the composite sediment sample were analyzed the ph was measured in a suspension with a 1 2 m v sediment to deionized water ratio the grain sizes were determined by wet sieving stoliker et al 2013 the mineral composition was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd text s2 and the total organic carbon toc was detected using an element analyzer ecs 4024 chnso costech italy the total mn content total reducible fe nh4 oxalate extractable and total sediment associated reactive fe ii hcl extractable were chemically extracted and determined text s2 the acid volatile sulfide avs concentration was determined using a purge and trap method text s2 the reagents used in this study were purchased from aladdin or macklin 2 2 laboratory experiments anaerobic batch experiments were performed in glass serum bottles sealed with rubber stoppers each experiment was conducted in triplicate in an anoxic chamber vigor sg2400 750ts f and the bottles were shaken in a thermostatic oscillator 150 r dlhr q200 o2 free synthetic river water srw was prepared to mimic the ion concentrations in the surface water in the study area text s3 and table s1 2 2 1 coupled biogeochemical transformation of n mn and fe approximately 300 g of the sediments was suspended in 300 ml o2 free srw in 500 ml glass serum bottles in a constant temperature vibrator dlhr q200 for 20 days at 25 2 c the bottles were shaken in the dark at a speed of 150 rpm at selected times 30 ml of the sediment suspensions was sampled and centrifuged for 30 min at 7830 r eppendorf centrifuge 5430 the supernatant was used to determine aqueous nitrate nitrite ammonium fe ii and mn concentrations text s4 the pellet was divided into two halves one half was extracted with kcl 2 m kcl for 2 h to measure the exchangeable ammonium in the sediments kempers and zweers 1986 and the other half was used to quantify sediment associated fe ii species using a three step sequential extraction method designed for the characterization of reactive fe ii speciation toward cr vi the three fractions of fe ii were named fractions 1 2 and 3 xu et al 2018 the details of the analytical methods are provided in text s4 2 2 2 kinetics of cr vi reduction four sets of anaerobic batch experiments were performed to investigate cr vi reduction mechanisms and to study cr vi reduction kinetics under different redox conditions the first set of experiments was performed to assess whether the composite sediment could immobilize cr vi approximately 8 g sediment sample was suspended in 100 ml o2 free srw in a 135 ml bottle the sediment suspension was spiked with 5 mm cr vi stock solution k2cro4 ar macklin to achieve the desired initial cr vi concentration 20 Î¼m the bottles were shaken at 25 2 c for 20 days at selected times approximately 5 ml of the suspension was sampled and filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m mixed cellulose ester mce syringe filter xinya the cr vi concentration in the filtrate was colorimetrically quantified using the diphenylcarbazide method brookshaw et al 2014 control experiments were conducted without sediments the second set of experiments was performed to investigate the contribution of microbial respiration to cr vi reduction since microbial activities would be suppressed by autoclaving and high temperature lovley and phillips 1988a cr vi reduction kinetics were performed in autoclaved sediments at 25 2 c and in pristine sediments at 60 2 c in a constant temperature vibrator dlhr q200 to prepare the autoclaved sediments 8 g sediments were suspended in 100 ml o2 free srw in sealed serum bottles autoclaved at 122 c for 20 min and cooled to 25 2 c before cr vi spike cr vi reduction in pristine sediments was performed with the same sediment water ratio 8 g 100 ml the initial cr vi concentrations were approximately 20 Î¼m the third set of experiments was conducted to evaluate the potential contribution of organic carbon oc to cr vi reduction the sediment and srw were mixed at a ratio of 1 2 m v for 2 h to extract oc and then the suspensions were centrifuged and filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m ptfe syringe filter jinteng the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using toc l cpn shimadzu japan after autoclaving at 122 c for 20 min 60 ml filtrate was adjusted to ph 8 2 and spiked with cr vi stock solution to achieve an initial concentration of 20 Î¼m the cr vi concentration in the solution was monitored at selected sampling times at 25 2 c the last set of experiments was to evaluate cr reduction kinetics in preincubated sediments because anaerobic microbial respiration can produce reducing agents such as fe ii or sulfide brookshaw et al 2014 smillie et al 1981 in 2017 sediment suspensions 50 g sediments 100 ml o2 free srw were incubated in the dark at 25 2 c during incubation the avs content of the suspensions was occasionally monitored after 10 and 20 days of incubation the suspensions were centrifuged at 7830 r for 30 min to separate the supernatant from the pellet the aqueous fe ii concentration in the supernatant and three sediment associated fe ii fractions were measured then approximately 8 g of the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml o2 free srw cr vi reduction kinetic experiments were carried out by spiking cr vi stock solution into different initial cr vi concentrations at 25 2 c after cr vi reduction experiments in sediments incubated for 20 days were completed the suspensions were centrifuged to collect the pellet and a strong alkaline solution 0 5 m naoh and 0 28 m na2co3 was used to extract cr vi that might have been adsorbed on the sediments graham et al 2009 in 2022 an additional cr vi reduction kinetic experiment was conducted in sediment preincubated for 46 days the details of the additional kinetic experiment are provided in text s5 2 3 numerical model framework a process based biogeochemical model was developed to describe the coupled biogeochemical transformation of c n mn fe and cr and the variation in fe ii reactivities toward cr vi reduction the model framework is summarized as follows 1 the dominant processes were identified from the kinetic experimental results and literature study and processes with less impact on the elemental transformation were ignored 2 appropriate reaction kinetic equations were chosen for the proposed processes 3 kinematic differential equations for all the chemical species were constructed and numerically solved with the explicit discretization method using matlab r2021a and 4 the parameters were fitted by a trial and error method using the experimental results obtained in 2017 and the variances of the parameters were estimated using the jacobian matrix and covariance matrix of the measurement errors the results obtained in 2022 were not used to calibrate the parameters of the model for three reasons 1 microorganisms continuously changed the chemical and biological properties of the sediment during the 5 years of storage 2 we were not able to characterize the initial chemical and biological properties of the aged sediment because the rest of the sediment was limited and 3 46 days was far beyond the experimental time scale in 2017 20 days and no replication was conducted to evaluate the validity of the result due to the limited sediment therefore the results obtained in 2022 were only used to evaluate the applicability and scope of the correlation between cr vi reduction rate constants and aqueous fe ii concentrations developed from the experimental results obtained in 2017 the details of the model development are discussed in section 3 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment properties and cr vi immobilization pathways in the sediment the sediment properties including ph mineralogy and grain size are provided in text s6 the toc content was high 2 88 0 25 due to agricultural activities the total mn content was 2 99 1 95 Î¼mol g the reducible fe content was 40 44 25 49 Î¼mol g the concentrations of the total sediment associated reactive fe ii ranged from 2 30 to 6 48 Î¼mol g due to the strong heterogeneity of the sediments the concentration of avs was near the detection limit 5 Î¼m implying the absence of avs an approach adopted from a previous study was used to identify the processes controlling cr vi immobilization in the sediments text s7 xu et al 2017 the results indicated that cr vi reduction by fe ii was the dominant immobilization mechanism which is consistent with previous reports that fe ii is the dominant reductant for cr vi at ph values greater than 5 5 fendorf et al 2000 xu et al 2017 in addition cr vi adsorption made a small contribution to cr vi immobilization 3 2 influence of coupled biogeochemical transformation of c n and mn on fe ii generation the nitrate concentration declined rapidly within 4 days fig 2 a meanwhile the nitrite concentration increased to 1 83 mm and diminished rapidly after nitrate was exhausted indicating that nitrite reduction was inhibited by nitrate glass and silverstein 1998 yan et al 2016 both aqueous and exchangeable ammonium increased with incubation time fig 2b many biogeochemical processes could be involved in n transformation covatti and grischek 2021 kuypers et al 2018 nitrate reduction may result from denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and assimilatory nitrate reduction processes nitrite generation and consumption may result from denitrification dnra assimilatory nitrate reduction and anammox processes the generation and consumption of aqueous and exchangeable ammonium may result from dnra nitrogen fixation anammox microbial consumption by microbial growth through assimilatory processes decomposition of microbes degradation of oc and ion exchange of ammonium processes theoretical calculation of reduction potentials for nitrate mn iv and fe iii suggested that nitrate should be reduced prior to mn iv reduction and mn iv reduction prior to fe iii reduction bhanja et al 2019 our results were partly in agreement with the theory the aqueous mn ii concentration continuously increased from 0 009 mm to 0 103 mm during 20 days of anaerobic incubation fig 2c meanwhile aqueous and sediment associated fe ii did not accumulate until nitrate and nitrite were exhausted fig 3 a although some studies reported inhibition of microbial mn iv reduction by nitrate dollhopf et al 2000 nealson and myers 1992 mn iv reduction in this study was not or at least not completely suppressed by nitrate and or nitrite in contrast nitrate and or nitrite can completely inhibit fe ii generation by competing for electrons with fe iii reduction or oxidizing fe ii through biotic and abiotic pathways dollhopf et al 2000 kappler et al 2021 the competition or inhibition relationship between mn iii iv and fe iii reductions is still under debate some studies indicate that mn iv can completely or partly inhibit fe ii generation through mn iv oxidation of fe ii lovley and phillips 1988b van bodegom and scholten 2001 but others report simultaneous reduction of mn iv and fe iii lin and taillefert 2014 peters and conrad 1996 in this study no inhibition of mn iv reduction on fe iii reduction was observed probably because mn iv and fe iii were solid substrates to which microbial access controlled the reduction process 3 3 the variation in three reactive fe ii fractions with fe transformation the variation in reactive fe ii fractions of the sediments was characterized with a three step extraction method table 1 and fig 3b the pristine sediments were exposed to air so that some of the reactive fe ii should already be oxidized as shown in table 1 the most reactive fe ii fraction 1 was absent in the pristine sediments a small amount of reactive fe ii was grouped in fraction 2 0 29 0 05 Î¼mol g and the majority of reactive fe ii was grouped in fraction 3 2 04 0 18 Î¼mol g the absence of fraction 1 indicated that this fraction was more easily oxidized in air than the other two fractions during anaerobic incubation after nitrate was exhausted both aqueous and sediment associated fe ii concentrations increased with incubation time fig 3a meanwhile all three reactive fe ii fractions increased with time fraction 1 increased most rapidly fraction 2 increased most slowly and the rate of generation of fraction 3 was between the other two fractions fig 3b thermodynamic equilibria such as sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium can drive the redistribution of freshly biogenic fe ii between the aqueous phase and solid phase gorski et al 2016 therefore each fraction of sediment associated fe ii was plotted against c f e 2 fig 3c the three fractions exhibited approximately linear correlations with c f e 2 with r2 values of 0 97 for fraction 1 p 0 01 0 77 for fraction 2 p 0 01 and 0 54 for fraction 3 p 0 01 the good correlation confirmed the tendency of freshly biogenic fe ii to reach sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium between aqueous fe ii and sediment associated fe ii the r2 value for fraction 3 was smaller than that for the other two fractions probably because fraction 3 was calculated from the difference between hcl extractable fe ii and sodium acetate extractable fe ii which were determined from parallel sediment samples sediment heterogeneity led to large uncertainty in fraction 3 autoclave is often used to sterilize sediments however the total sediment associated reactive fe ii increased from 2 33 0 23 Î¼mol g to 7 17 0 82 Î¼mol g after autoclaving table 1 the reactive fe ii fractions also changed reactive fe ii in fractions 1 and 3 increased and that in fraction 2 disappeared table 1 although the underlying reasons are unclear a possible explanation could be that high temperature and pressure destroyed or altered the structure and phase of fe bearing minerals thus releasing incorporated solid form fe ii and new thermodynamic equilibria led to different fe ii speciation regenspurg et al 2002 since autoclaves influenced the amount and speciation of reactive fe ii in the sediments other sterilization methods should be considered 3 4 cr vi reduction in sediments containing variable reactive fe ii fractions the reactivity of sediment associated fe ii toward cr vi was evaluated using cr vi reduction in sediments containing variable fe ii fractions the pristine sediment was able to remove approximately 30 of cr vi spiked into the sediment suspension after 70 h fig 4 a as expected cr vi reduction rates in the preincubated sediments significantly increased compared to those in the pristine sediments fig 4 b d due to the increase in the three reactive fe ii fractions table 1 a previous study reported that cr vi reduction rates in pristine sediments and autoclaved sediments were the same for sediments from the hanford site usa unexpectedly in this study cr vi removal in autoclaved sediments was significantly faster than that in pristine sediments fig 4a because the total sediment associated reactive fe ii and most reactive fe ii fraction fraction 1 increased table 1 in general the variation in reactive fe ii fractions well explained the difference in cr vi reduction rates in the four sediments 3 5 development of the process based model first n transformation processes were simplified the reasons to simplify the n transformation processes are provided in text s8 in summary nitrate reduction to nitrite nitrite reduction to n2 the degradation of particulate organic carbon poc as the source of ammonium and doc and ion exchange of ammonium between the aqueous and solid phases were considered in this study table 2 r1 r4 inhibition of nitrite reduction by nitrate has been widely reported glass and silverstein 1998 cr vi is toxic to many soil microorganisms that can function in n mn and fe transformation ross et al 1981 thus the inhibition of nitrate on r2 and cr vi on r1 and r2 should be considered the reaction kinetics of nitrate and nitrite reduction degradation of poc and ion exchange of ammonium can be described using the following equations yan et al 2016 zarnetske et al 2012 1 r i i i q i x j c j k s r i j c j 2 i i k k i k r i k i k r i c k 3 r 3 k poc q poc 4 r i Î± i q j k d j c j where ri is the reaction rate of process i ii is the inhibition term k i k r i is the inhibition coefficient for chemical species k in reaction i qi is the

j in reaction i qj is the solid content of chemical species j kpoc is the degradation rate for poc k d j is the distribution coefficient of chemical species j between solid and aqueous phases and Î±i is the first order mass transfer coefficient of chemical species j between solid and aqueous phases the mn content in the sediments was much lower than that of reducible fe 2 99 1 95 Î¼mol g vs 40 44 25 49 Î¼mol g and the influence of mn transformation on fe transformation was small figs 2c and 3a thus the complex transformation of mn was not considered in this study only microbial reduction of mn iv was considered because this process competes with microbial fe iii reduction for doc microbial reduction of mn iv and fe iii table 2 r5 and r6 can be described using eq 5 van bodegom and scholten 2001 5 r i i i q i x q i j c j k s r i j c j where qi is the reducible fe and mn contents in the sediments the inhibition of mn iv and fe iii reduction by nitrate and cr vi was considered in the model using eq 2 the biogenic fe ii was redistributed to three reactive fe ii fractions driven by sorptive and redox equilibrium table 2 r7 the redistribution of biogenic fe ii can be described using eqs 4 and 6 6 c f e 2 swr n 1 3 q f e i i n c fe ii where c fe ii is the total sediment associated reactive fe ii concentration which includes aqueous fe ii c f e 2 and the three fractions of sediment associated fe ii fractions q fe ii n cr vi adsorption table 2 r8 was described using eq 4 and cr vi reduction table 2 r9 was described using a saturation type model published elsewhere sorwat et al

in reaction Ñ table 2 the initial concentrations of fe iii and poc were assumed to be the reducible fe and toc contents in the sediments the initial concentration of mn iv was the total mn content multiplied by an activity coefficient Î·i because the majority of the sediment mn is not microbially available lovley 1991 the initial doc concentration was estimated from the oc concentration extracted from the sediments 0 44 mm the initial concentrations of n species no3 no2 nh4 exchangeable nh4 aqueous fe ii and mn ii and sediment associated fe ii fractions were measured for each experiment biomass was estimated from a common soil cell density 4 5 107 cells g sediment bickel and or 2020 raynaud and nunan 2014 and the typical cell weight 10 12 g cell yan et al 2016 the parameters used in the study and reported in previous studies are compared in table s3 some parameters were adopted from the literature for example half saturation constants for doc and nitrite k s r i doc and k s r 2 no 2 and the inhibition coefficient of cr vi on microbial activity k i cr vi the distribution coefficients for reactive fe ii fractions k d sed fe ii were the slope of the linear regression between sediment associated fe ii fractions and aqueous fe ii concentrations fig 3c distribution coefficients for ammonium and cr vi k d nh 4 and k d cr vi were calculated from the ratio between simultaneously monitored concentrations of their soil and aqueous species assuming that adsorption and iron exchange kinetics were faster than redox reactions other parameters were fitted by matching the simulated results to the experimental results figs 2 4 first the coupled biogeochemical transformation of n mn fe and c was fitted then these parameters were used to fit cr vi immobilization in sediments under variable redox conditions the goodness of the model fit was evaluated by minimizing the root mean square relative error rmsre l n s 1 c l c l 2 n s where c is the simulated value and ns is the total number of samples li and sun 2020 the variances for the estimated parameters were evaluated using the jacobian matrix and covariance matrix of the measurement errors text s9 in general the process based model well described the coupled biogeochemical transformation of n mn fe c and cr figs 2 4 there was a discrepancy between the simulated and experimental nitrite production and reduction kinetics fig 2a this discrepancy indicated that some biogeochemical processes might be missed such as anammox nitrate reducing fe ii oxidation and variation in the expression of nitrate and nitrite reductase klueglein et al 2013 kuypers et al 2018 tian et al 2020 since the influence of nitrite reaction kinetics on the reactivity of fe ii was small nitrite reaction kinetics were not a focus of this study not all the parameters were well constrained table s3 in general the rate constants q and most of the kn distribution coefficients kd and mass transfer coefficients Î± were well constrained the rate constants for fractions 3 in the sediments exhibited large uncertainties because the reduction rates for fractions 3 were too slow the degradation rate for poc kpoc and the stoichiometric coefficient of nh4 releasement due to poc degradation Î³ nh 4 also exhibited large uncertainties because the model lacked experimental data of poc degradation to constrain the parameter estimation other parameters containing large uncertainties included half saturation constants ks and inhibition factors ki unsurprisingly it has been proven that kinetic parameters in the saturation type models are linearly correlated so that the relative standard deviation of correlated parameters Ï Î¸m Î¸m could be as large as 80 depending on experimental conditions liu and zachara 2001 3 6 variation in fe ii reactivity toward cr vi in natural sediments the average rate constants k n f n k n where fn is the percentage of the reactive fe ii fractions for cr vi reduction by sediments from dengxu and hanford xu et al 2018 are plotted against c f e 2 in fig 5 a the k for sediments with low c f e 2 dengxu sediments without preincubation and hanford sediments preincubated for up to 40 days varied by 2 orders of magnitude due to the differences in reactive fe ii fractions fn however using the multirate model the difference in kn for sediments with low c f e 2 was only 2 times kn in table s3 although dengxu and hanford sediments had different reactive fe ii speciation mineralogy organic matter contents and microbial communities the similar values of kn for sediments with low c f e 2 verified the applicability of the three step sequential extraction method for the characterization of reactive fe ii fractions in natural sediments interestingly the values of kn for dengxu sediments increased with the preincubation time of the sediments fig 5b the rate constants for fractions 1 and 2 k1 and k2 in the sediment preincubated for 46 days could not be constrained by the experimental data because the cr vi reduction rate was extremely fast at the beginning of the experiment fig 4d approximately 640 Î¼m cr vi was removed from the aqueous phase within 7 min when we took the first sample reduction of 640 Î¼m cr vi would consume 35 Î¼mol g fe ii which is more than reactive fe ii grouped in fraction 1 27 03 Î¼mol g and close to the sum of reactive fe ii in fractions 1 and 2 39 03 Î¼mol g table 1 the mass balance calculation suggested that fractions 1 and 2 were oxidized before our first sampling consequently only the rate constant for fraction 3 k3 in the sediment preincubated for 46 days was well constrained by the experimental data an increase in kn with preincubation time was not observed in our previous studies conducted at the hanford site liu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 2017 the difference between the two studies is that aqueous fe ii accumulated during preincubation for dengxu sediments fig 3a while no aqueous fe ii was detected in hanford sediments up to 20 days preincubation and aqueous fe ii was barely detected until 40 days preincubation the values of kn for dengxu sediments preincubated for 0 10 20 and 46 days were plotted against c f e 2 measured at the same time fig 5c surprisingly the values of log kn approximately linearly correlated with c f e 2 with r2 0 98 table 1 the linear correlation between log ki and c f e 2 for fraction 1 and fraction 2 was statistically significant at the level of p 0 05 the linear correlation between log k3 and c f e 2 was statistically significant at the level of p 0 01 note that the linear correlation between log k3 and c f e 2 using the data obtained in 2017 was not statistically significant p 0 21 because there were only 3 data points and the variances of k3 were too large by adding one more data point the p value for fraction 3 could be improved from 0 21 to 0 01 previous studies in aqueous fe ii fe oxyhydr oxide systems have shown that log k linearly correlates with the eh of the system and eh linearly correlates with log c f e 2 gorski et al 2016 stewart et al 2018 thus theoretically log k should be linearly correlated with log c f e 2 the theoretical relationship is deduced based on two assumptions 1 electron transfer occurs preceding the rate limiting step reach equilibrium stewart et al 2018 and 2 thermodynamic equilibria such as sorptive equilibrium and redox equilibrium are achieved gorski et al 2016 however these assumptions may not be valid for cr vi reduction in natural sediments first cr vi reduction is a three electron reaction so the first assumption may not be valid second achieving thermodynamic equilibrium is difficult in natural sediments because of the physical heterogeneity in microstructures and chemical heterogeneity in fe bearing minerals and other redox pairs a previous study showed that the correlation between eh and c f e 2 in natural sediments was complicated peters and conrad 1996 reanalysis of the data from this study text s10 indicated that eh linearly correlated better with log c f e 2 for some sediments and eh linearly correlated better with c f e 2 for other sediments if the sediments were incubated for a long time 40 70 days piecewise functions should be used to describe the correlation between eh and c f e 2 therefore we propose the following equation to estimate the variation in kn during anaerobic incubation 9 log k n a c f e 2 b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the linear regression for log kn and aqueous fe ii concentrations as disused above eq 9 is an empirical model that should be used with caution nevertheless this empirical model is supported by thermodynamic relationships and the values of kn estimated by this model are less influenced by the coupled biogeochemical transformation of c n and mn for example biogenic fe ii was inhibited by nitrate and nitrite thus influencing the variation in kn with incubation time fig 5b in contrast the delay of fe ii generation would not influence the correlation between log kn and c f e 2 4 conclusions a process based model was developed to describe the influence of coupled biogeochemical processes on the variation in reactivity of sediment associated fe ii toward cr vi reduction the model was used to investigate cr vi reduction rates in natural sediments from dengxu china and hanford usa the average reduction rate constants k for cr vi reduction by reactive fe ii in different sediments varied by more than 4 orders of magnitude the large variation in fe ii reactivity in the sediments was attributed to the difference in reactive fe ii speciation and reactivity under different redox conditions sediment associated fe ii can be grouped into three fractions fn with different redox rate constants kn in a multirate model using this model the variation in kn for different sediments was significantly reduced under anaerobic conditions reactive fe ii generation was influenced by the coupled biogeochemical transformation of c n and mn for example the presence of nitrate and nitrite inhibited fe ii generation and the competition between microbially driven elemental transformations for organic carbon also influenced fe ii generation kinetics the freshly biogenic fe ii in dengxu sediments was redistributed in the sediments resulting in a significant increase in the three reactive fe ii fractions and their reactivities kn the values of log kn were approximately linearly correlated with c f e 2 the reactivities kn for freshly biogenic fe ii in hanford sediments during up to 40 days of anaerobic incubation did not significantly increase as aqueous fe ii barely accumulated in hanford sediments the model framework developed in this study is able to describe and predict cr vi reduction kinetics in natural sediments where spatial and temporal chemical and biological heterogeneities lead to large variations in fe

15451,in this work we demonstrate the development evaluation and pre liminary application of a novel passive sampler for monitoring of selected pharmaceuticals in environmental waters the samplers were calibrated in laboratory based experiments to obtain sampling rates rs for carbamazepine methocarbamol etilefrine venlafaxine and nevirapine passive sampling was based on the diffusion of the target pharmaceuticals from surface water through a membrane bag which housed an ionic liquid as a green receiving solvent and a molecularly imprinted polymer effects of biofouling deployment time and solvent type for the receiver phase were optimized for selective uptake of analytes in surface water notably there was a decrease in the uptake of selected pharmaceuticals and consequently a decrease in their sampling rates in the presence of biofouling the optimum matrix matched sampling rates ranged from 0 0007 0 0018 l d 1 whilst the method detection and quantification limits ranged from 2 45 3 26 ng l 1 and 8 06 10 81 ng l 1 respectively the optimized passive sampler was deployed in a dam situated in the heart of a typical highly populated township in the gauteng province of south africa only etilefrine and methocarbamol were detected and quantified at maximum time weighted average concentrations of 12 88 and 72 29 ng l 1 respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords passive sampling molecularly imprinted polymer membrane assisted solvent extraction pharmaceuticals aliquat 336 environmental monitoring 1 introduction globally pharmaceuticals are increasingly being used as medications for both humans and animals they are now considered an important group of persistent emerging pollutants due to being continuously detected in the aquatic environments bueno et al 2012 gogoi et al 2018 vermeirssen et al 2008 as such they have become a global concern to the scientific community owing to their detrimental health effects and microbial resistance in aquatic life gogoi et al 2018 lÃ³pez pacheco et al 2019 although they are typically available at trace levels Âµg l 1 ng l 1 or even pg l 1 in aquatic environments kÃ¼mmerer 2010 lausier 2009 their monitoring is important in the assessment of pollution and identification of pollution sources wang et al 2020 most water monitoring programmes depend on the conventional grab sampling of water at a specific time however this sampling method has drawbacks in monitoring the presence of pollutants as it only provides pollutant concentrations at the time of sampling which in most cases is not a true reflection of the extent of pollution taylor et al 2021 vrana et al 2005a wang et al 2020 for an example a south african based study has indicated an increase of 48 54 in pharmaceutical load into a wastewater treatment plant from 12 30 to 3 30 p m amdany et al 2015 which is an indication of concentration variations during the course of the day hence it is important to design an efficient sampling tool that accounts for the variations of concentrations in the environment over a short period additionally pre concentrating environmental pollutants to quantifiable concentration levels can be expensive and tedious as large sample volumes accompanied by several sample preparation steps are required bueno et al 2016 taylor et al 2021 passive sampling technique has displayed qualities of being a promising approach to traditional grab sampling for the monitoring of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments togola et al 2007 vrana et al 2021 the technique makes use of passive sampling devices which permit unprompted in situ extraction and pre concentration of analytes over longer periods of time vrana et al 2021 this then allows for time integrated or time weighted average twa concentrations of analytes which considers variations in pollutant concentrations and in turn increases the capabilities of the device to detecting and quantifying contaminants at trace levels garnier et al 2020 lohmann et al 2017 vrana et al 2005b passive samplers are simple less labouring cost effective easy to handle and nonmechanical devices which can be operated without power supply lohmann et al 2017 taylor et al 2021 an ideal sampler would normally consist of an acceptor phase and a membrane which separates the acceptor phase and the aqueous sample the acceptor phase is selected based on its ability to accept or extract target compounds from the water body verhagen et al 2020 currently the widely used and commercially available passive sampler in environmental monitoring of pharmaceuticals is the polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis consisting of a sorptive receiver phase normally covered by a microporous polyethersulphone membrane godlewska et al 2020 however recent studies have shown that the pocis is effective for qualitative analysis but has several flaws which makes it a semi quantitative tool for monitoring of pharmaceuticals taylor et al 2021 vermeirssen et al 2012 some of its weaknesses include the misunderstood accumulation mechanism and its vulnerability to physicochemical parameters like the water ph conductivity dissolved organic matter biofouling water flow and temperature booij and chen 2018 djomte et al 2018 for these reasons accumulation rates or sampling rates rs obtained from laboratory calibration of the sampler may be biased when applied in the field mÄczykowska et al 2017 currently a few studies have resorted to in situ calibrations of the pocis with the view to minimize the doubts in the estimation of the accumulated concentration garnier et al 2020 verhagen et al 2020 vrana et al 2021 this is an indication that more research is needed in the search for alternative passive samplers for monitoring of pharmaceuticals in environmental waters in this work we designed and optimized a novel alternative passive sampler based on membrane assisted solvent extraction and a molecularly imprinted polymer mase mip for monitoring of the selected model compounds in aquatic environments this was achieved by synthesizing a smart polymer and then enclosing it in a membrane bag containing a receiver solvent and finally enclosing them in a polyvinyl chloride pvc cage and deployed as a passive sampler the idea was to investigate the possibilities of using greener and stable solvents such as the deep eutectic solvents dess and ionic liquids ils as an alternative approach to the conventional organic solvents in the receiver phase of the passive sampler in recent years dess which share few properties with ils have gained a lot of interests in the various fields of analytical chemistry e g sample preparation micro extraction mass spectrometry etc santana mayor et al 2021 shishov et al 2017 the two green solvents share unique physicochemical properties such as nonflammability and low volatility moreover dess have added advantages over ils which include being eco friendly mostly biodegradable cheaper and easily produced prepared from a hydrogen bond acceptor and a hydrogen bond donor therefore good in the dissolution of pharmaceuticals santana mayor et al 2021 shishov et al 2017 the developed passive sampler is based on the diffusion of selected pharmaceuticals from surface water through the membrane bag into the green solvent receiving phase followed by the selective adsorption of analytes onto the mip cavities over a period of 14 days upon retrieval of the passive sampler from the surface water analytes were desorbed from the mip and analyzed using liquid chromatography equipped with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry detection system lc qtof ms other parameters such as the effects of biofouling and deployment time were optimized for selective uptake of analytes in surface water the passive samplers were then calibrated through matrix matched laboratory based experiments to obtain sampling rates for each target pharmaceutical for purposes of estimating twa concentrations for each pharmaceutical the target pharmaceuticals with their physicochemical properties provided in table 1 were an antidepressant venlafaxine an antiretroviral nevirapine a muscle relaxant methocarbamol an anticonvulsant carbamazepine and a cardiac stimulant etilefrine finally the mase mip based passive sampler was deployed for selective monitoring of five pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic groups in orlando dam situated in the heart of soweto township a biggest south african township in this regard this is the first study to investigate the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in orlando dam 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents analytical grade venlafaxine hydrochloride 98 carbamazepine etilefrine hydrochloride methocarbamol nevirapine and p vinylbenzoic acid 97 were all obtained in powder form while ethylene glycol dimethacrylate 98 1 octanol 99 and trioctylmethylammonium chloride aliquat 336 were obtained in liquid form from sigma aldrich johannesburg south africa uhplc grade methanol 99 9 dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile 99 8 toluene 99 7 and formic acid 95 were also purchased from sigma aldrich johannesburg south africa chloroform 99 and cyclohexane 99 and sodium chloride were purchased from associated chemical enterprises ace johannesburg south africa nitrogen gas was obtained from afrox johannesburg south africa 2 2 synthesis of a molecularly imprinted polymer synthesis of a mip was adopted from our previous work khulu et al 2022a to synthesize the smart polymer 15 mg of the template venlafaxine was dissolved in 3 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide at 40 c for 5 min while stirring 30 mg of p vinyl benzoic acid functional monomer was added into the mixture while heating for a further 10 min the reaction mixture temperature was then raised to 60 c and 167 Âµl of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate cross linker was added to the reaction while stirring and heating for further 10 min an initiator 1 1 azobis cyclohexanecarbonitrile 10 mg was added to the mixture and the system was purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min finally the reaction temperature was then raised to 80 c to achieve polymerization mip cavities were generated by washing the polymer excessively with methanol for removal of the template this synthetic approach has been previously reported to result in the formation of a mip that is selective to the five target pharmaceuticals khulu et al 2022a 2022b this was due to cross selectivity resulting from interactions occurring between the functional groups of pharmaceuticals and the functional monomer p vinylbenzoic acid in this case interactions occurred through hydrogen bonding taking place between the oxygen of the hydroxyl group or the nitrogen of the target compounds and the hydrogen of the carboxylic group of the functional monomer other anticipated interactions were Ï Ï interactions based on the benzene rings also the size of venlafaxine used as the template molecule ensured that the created cavities allowed for entrance and subsequent binding of targeted pharmaceuticals which are all smaller than the template onto the mip this excluded the bigger molecules from accessing the mip cavities furthermore other smaller compounds which could have been loosely bound on the mip cavities get eliminated during the washing step this step has been found to play a significant role in eliminating interferences during the molecular recognition process mbhele et al 2018 zunngu et al 2017 therefore the synthesized mip displayed high affinity towards all the five model pharmaceuticals with maximum matrix matched adsorption capacities ranging between 206 and 418 ng mg 1 for individual pharmaceuticals moreover the mip could be re used up to four times without losing its high binding affinity towards target pharmaceuticals fig 1 gives a general illustration of the mip synthesis procedure 2 3 instrumentation and apparatus a temperature controlled wisecube wig 105 precise shaking incubator supplied by wisd laboratory instruments wertheim bw germany was used for template removal from the mip samples were centrifuged through a rotofix 32a centrifuge from hettich frankfurt hessen germany polypropylene membrane bags 4 cm long 0 03 mm wall thickness 6 mm internal diameter were purchased from chemetrix export johannesburg south africa empty spe cartridges with a 1 ml capacity and 6 mm diameter fitted with 10 Âµm frits at the bottom were purchased from anatech instruments johannesburg south africa deionized water was produced through a millipore directq 3 uv waters system 2345 from millipore massachusetts usa the magnetic stirrer used in deployment experiments was purchased from c c imelmann pty ltd johannesburg south africa the spe vacuum manifold was purchased from phenomex carlifornia usa whilst the vacuum pump was purchased from gilson williers le bel france the hi98194 multiparamer meter used for in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters was purchased from hanna instruments johannesburg south africa the uhplc system used for separation and analysis of pharmaceuticals was the thermo scientific dionex ultimate 3000 from themofisher scientific waltham ma usa the instrument consisted of a hpg 3200rs pump and a wps 3000trs autosampler the uhplc was coupled to a quadrupole time of flight compact mass spectrometer system from bruker daltonics inc billerica ma usa for collection and processing of qualitative data bruker compass dataanalysis version 4 3 build 110 102 1532 was used while bruker compass quantanalysis version 4 3 build 110 102 1532 was utilized for collection and processing of quantitative data chromatographic separation of analytes was achieved on a luna omega c18 column 50 4 6 mm 3 Î¼m from phenomenex torrance ca usa separation was through gradient elution using solvent a 0 1 formic acid in deionized water and solvent b 0 1 formic acid in acetonitrile all five pharmaceuticals were separated within 14 min initially solvent b was kept at 5 for 1 min this was followed by gradually increasing the amount of solvent b until it reached 55 at 6 min and kept constant for 2 min the amount of solvent b was further increased gradually until it reached 95 at 10 min and kept constant for further 2 min finally the amount of solvent b was dropped to 5 for a minute and kept constant for another minute khulu et al 2022a 2 4 development of a mase mip based passive sampler 2 4 1 mase preparation pre conditioning of extraction membranes was achieved by immersing the polypropylene membranes into a beaker containing cyclohexane and shaking at 150 rpm for approximately 3 h this step was repeated 3 times with clean portions of cyclohexane the metal cylinders were not removed from the membrane bag during the procedure to ensure that the inside walls of the membranes were also conditioned after pre conditioning the membrane bags were dried out and then soaked in the extraction solvent i e chloroform des or il for at least 2 h 2 4 2 design and preparation of mase mip based passive sampler the passive sampler device was designed and machined in house using a cost effective pvc pipe purchased from a local hardware supermarket the pvc pipe consisted of a top and bottom cap the latter was glued to the bottom of the pipe by pvc glue the length of the sampler chamber was 10 cm with internal diameter of 5 5 cm the sampler chamber was drilled to create multiple holes as shown on fig 2 a which became essential for the flow of water mip particles 50 mg were transferred into the interior of the polypropylene membrane bag the bag was filled with 1 ml of receiver solution solvent the membrane bag containing a mixture of mip particles and receiver solution was then tied with a cotton string as a means of temporary sealing the bag was then placed inside the chamber the chamber can fit 5 to 6 propylene membrane bags for laboratory deployments the mase mip based passive samplers were placed in a 5 l glass beaker containing 3 l of either deionized or dam water spiked with 1 104 ng l 1 of target pharmaceutical compounds as shown in fig 2b after extraction the mip and the acceptor solution mixture was transferred into a 1 ml empty spe cartridge fitted with a 10 Âµm frit at the bottom and then mounted onto an spe vacuum manifold the receiver solution was allowed to flow through the spe cartridge and discarded while safeguarding against any mip particle losses by means of frits the mip was then washed with 1 ml chloroform to eliminate interferences and then a steady vacuum was then applied by means of external vacuum pump to dry the mip particles then the adsorbed pharmaceuticals were eluted from the mip cavities using 4 1 ml of methanol for environmental monitoring the solvent extracts were reduced to 1 ml by purging with a gentle stream of nitrogen gas prior to injection to the lc qtof ms for identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals 2 5 optimization of extraction parameters 2 5 1 effect of acceptor phase in this step the aim was to adapt conditions from our previous work khulu et al 2022b where chloroform was used as an organic receiver phase however owing to chloroform s volatility it was not possible to apply it as an receiver solvent for long extraction periods chloroform volatilized to dryness within two to three days of deployment this raised a need to explore more stable low volatility and environmentally friendly solvents in this regard a des prepared by mixing methyltrioctylammonium chloride aliquat 336 and 1 octanol in a ratio of 50 50 v v and an ionic liquid aliquat 336 were investigated as possible extraction solvents des preparation followed the same method described by tang and colleagues where aliquat 336 1 octanol were mixed in a 1 1 ratio in a glass vial and heated at a temperature of 80 c with constant stirring at 350 rpm for 2 h to form a homogenous mixture tang et al 2018 to assess the effect of solvent type a polypropylene membrane bag was filled with 50 mg mip particles and 1 ml of either the des or the il and then tied with a cotton string thereafter 5 l glass beakers were filled with 3 l of deionized water spiked with 2 104 ng l 1 of the selected model pharmaceuticals thereafter the prepared passive samplers based on either des or il as an acceptor solvent were deployed in the spiked solutions each passive sampler chamber consisted of four membrane bags and on day 1 3 5 and 7 a membrane bag was retrieved from each passive sampler chamber and treated using the method explained in 2 4 3 prior to lc qtof ms analysis these experiments were done in triplicates also on each of those days a 0 5 ml sample of donor phase was sampled and taken to lc qtof ms for analysis 2 5 2 effect of exposure time and biofouling effect of exposure time and biofouling was conducted in order to understand the accumulation of the selected model pharmaceuticals onto the sampling device during the time of deployment sampling rates were estimated using eq 1 1 r s m s c w t where rs is the sampling rate l d 1 ms is the mass of analytes accumulated in the receiving phase ng cw is the mean water concentration ng l 1 t is the deployment time days extraction of targeted pharmaceuticals was done in a period of 14 days where a passive sampler chamber containing six membrane bags with acceptor phase mixture was immersed at about 10 cm deep into a 5 l glass beaker containing 3 l of deionized spiked with 1 104 ng l 1 of analytes on day 1 3 5 9 11 and 14 a single membrane bag was removed from each deployment system followed by desorption of analytes from mip and their analysis with lc qtof ms additionally on each of those days a 0 5 ml sample of aqueous sample was sampled and taken to lc qtof ms for analysis these experiments were done in triplicate furthermore a second laboratory scale calibration of the sampler was done using environmental surface water sampled from florida lake gauteng south africa 26 1739 s 27 8971 e this environmental surface water was initially analyzed for the presence of the target pharmaceuticals using an analytical method that was previously developed by our research group khulu et al 2022b none of the target pharmaceuticals were found in water samples from florida lake the purpose of performing this calibration with an environmental sample was to investigate the effect of biofouling on the passive sampler sampling rates with the view to understand the behavior of the sampler in the environment this was achieved by immersing the passive sampler into the glass beaker containing 3 l of the water spiked with 1 104 ng l 1 of analytes and stirring the system at 100 rpm the experiments were done in triplicate over a period of 14 days the ph of the water at the time of sampling was 7 36 and a temperature of 25 1 c which is equivalent to room temperature calculations of the sampling rates were done using eq 1 2 6 study site and field deployment of passive samplers the passive samplers were deployed at the orlando dam 26 2561 s 27 9222 e situated in soweto a highly populated and biggest south african township located in the gauteng province this dam is situated in the downstream of a big government owned hospital a private hospital and a shopping mall fig 3 orlando dam receives water from the baileyspruit and diepkloofspruit streams which both cut through the highly populated soweto township the dam serves as recreational fishing dam as utilized by the members of the community during the time of deployment and retrieval of passive sampler the dam was found to be surrounded by hyacinth and other vegetation which is a sign of eutrophication a study by bengu and colleagues reported a presence of nitrites nitrates phosphates and faecal coliform bacteria in the orlando dam surface water bengu et al 2017 in the present study three passive sampling devices were deployed in three parts of the orlando dam fig 3 these three sites were the most accessible and conducive part of the dam for passive sampling physicochemical parameters such ph 7 74 conductivity 485 Âµs cm 1 total dissolved solids 243 mg l 1 and temperature 27 6 c were all measured in situ at the time of deployment water from this dam pours into the klipspruit stream a stream which has been documented in reports by the water research commission and the city of johannesburg as being highly impacted by sewage discharge bengu et al 2017 the passive samplers were deployed in orlando dam for 14 days the period at which samplers were operating at the integrative regime for estimation of twa concentrations of the targeted pharmaceuticals eq 2 was used 2 c w c s m s r s t

grabbed into pre cleaned plastic bottles from orlando dam and transported into the laboratory in a cooler box for further preparation the samples were filtered through 0 22 Âµm syringe filters merck johannesburg south africa followed by pre treatment with a mase mip technique developed and validated in our previous work khulu et al 2022b the sample vial consisted of 18 ml water sample saturated in 5 g sodium chloride and a propylene membrane bag filled with 1 ml chloroform and 50 mg of mip the samples were stirred at 400 rpm for a duration of 60 minutes to allow for extraction of targeted compounds thereafter the contents of the membrane bag were transferred into 1 ml empty spe cartridge with 10 Âµm frits at the bottom and mounted onto an spe manifold chloroform was allowed to flow through the spe cartridge utilizing a gravitational force and sent to waste a steady vacuum was then applied to dry the mip particles followed by elution of analytes with 4 1 ml of methanol after which the extracts were combined and reduced to 1 ml by gentle purging with nitrogen gas and then finally taken to the lc qtof ms for chromatographic determination and quantification this step was conducted to check for any variability in the results obtained by mase mip and the passive sampler 3 results and discussions 3 1 optimization of extraction conditions 3 1 1 acceptor phase in this step we investigated the solvent type on the extraction of target compounds upon discovering that chloroform could not be utilized as an extraction solvent for long term a des aliquat 336 1 octanol on a 1 1 ratio and an il aliquat 336 were investigated as suitable solvents these solvents with their chemical structures given in fig 4 were chosen based on their stability and their ability to allow for hydrogen bonding however in the mase mip technique an effective solvent should allow for both the movement of analytes across the polypropylene membrane as well as not interfere with their binding onto the mip cavities chimuka et al 2011 fig 5 demonstrates accumulated amount of each target pharmaceutical on the mip using the three tested solvents during the 7 days of deployment from the figure it can be noted that the extraction of target pharmaceuticals by chloroform could only be achieved over a period of two days as it would have completely evaporated by the end of day three it was also noted that target pharmaceuticals were extracted and transported better using aliquat 336 this is possibly due to the interactions taking place between the chloride of aliquat 336 and the hydrogen atom of the amide and or hydroxyl functional groups present in the target pharmaceuticals chemical structures provided in table 1 also electrostatic interactions are expected to occur between the nitrogen ion present in aliquat 336 and oxygen of the pharmaceutical compounds this also means that the movement of analytes from the solvent to the mip cavities was more pronounced with aliquat 336 than it was with the des even though literature suggests that dess are good in the dissolution of pharmaceuticals due to their excellent physicochemical properties dai et al 2013 shishov et al 2017 tang et al 2017 it can be noted that the dess would have been utilized in direct contact with the aqueous sample e g liquid liquid extraction for an example tang and coworkers extracted two antibiotics from environmental water through liquid liquid microextraction with an aid of the same des tang et al 2018 in the present study there is a protective layer offered by the polypropylene membrane bag between the sample and the extraction also the extraction takes place in two stages therefore based on the results obtained further experiments were conducted with aliquat 336 as an extraction solvent 3 1 2 effect of exposure time and biofouling to be able to determine time weighted concentrations of analytes in environmental water determination of accumulation rates sampling rates onto the mip cavities is paramount during the deployment period the accumulation of analytes onto the sampler sorbent can be described in three regimes the first one is the linear regime the second is the curvilinear regime and the third one is the equilibrium regime the linear regime is the range at which sampling rates are calculated this parameter can be affected by a number of factors which can include biofouling turbulence temperature ph and diffusion of analytes through the membrane garnier et al 2020 in this work the water ph was adjusted to 7 5 and the system was stirred at 100 rpm with the aim of mimicking environmental water ph and dam water hydrodynamic conditions in some cases the stirring rate influences the partitioning of analytes from donor to receiver phase quintana and reemtsma 2006 however in the case of compounds with logkow 3 same as the target compounds table 1 not much gain can be obtained by increasing the stirring rate nyoni et al 2011 this phenomenon was proven to be true in the case of the target pharmaceuticals where increasing the stirring rate from 400 rpm to 1200 rpm did not have a positive effect on their extraction process khulu et al 2022b this is because our target pharmaceuticals have a logkow 3 ranging from 0 1 2 9 table 1 the samplers were immersed in a beaker containing 1 104 ng l 1 of each target pharmaceutical and their accumulation on the mip cavities was measured over a period of 14 days good linear regressions were obtained for all compounds fig 6 with r2 values ranging from 0 9782 to 0 9924 the sampling rates were determined through eq 1 using the slope ms t 1 of the linear regression plot and the concentration in the water cw the rs values l d 1 obtained table 2 ranged from 0 0009 to 0 0028 for individual pharmaceuticals these values assisted in understanding the volume of water that can be extracted by the passive sampler per day acceptable precision for triplicate results was indicated by relative standard deviation ranging from 5 1 7 9 in order to understand and estimate the uptake rates of the passive sampler in environmental water another laboratory scale matrix matched calibration was conducted the purpose of conducting the matrix matched calibrations was to estimate sampling rates that are closer to field sampling rates and to understand the effect of biofouling on the uptake of target pharmaceuticals in this instance the accumulation of pharmaceuticals on the mip cavities was measured over a period of 14 days good linear regressions fig 7 with good correlation values ranging from 0 9715 to 0 9910 were obtained the rs values attained ranged from 0 0007 to 0 0018 l d 1 triplicate results yielded relative standard deviation ranging from 7 9 13 5 from fig 7 it can be observed that the accumulation of target compounds was affected by biofouling a drop in the accumulation could have been caused by slowed down diffusion of analytes through the polypropylene membrane bag as biofouling accumulated on the membrane surface over time of all the targeted pharmaceuticals carbamazepine is the most investigated compound in passive sampling based studies table 3 gives a summary of the studied compounds and their estimated sampling rates it is well noted that there is quite a variation in the sampling rates for individual compounds which is attributed to the different parameters under which the sampler calibrations were carried bayen and coworkers table 3 estimated different sampling rates for the same compound when calibration was carried under different physicochemical conditions bayen et al 2014 this then emphasizes a need for calibration of samplers at conditions closer to the environmental conditions of the chosen deployment site in the present study the sampling rates are observed to be lower than those reported in literature which could be due to several factors one factor could be the type of membrane used in the present study as this influences the permeation of compounds into the receiver phase another factor could be the density of the applied receiver solvent this observation has been reported by bayen and coworkers where they observed a variation in sampling rates for the same compound due to several factors bayen et al 2014 in this case carrying out the experiments at temperatures higher than the ambient temperature could reduce the viscosity of solvent and in turn improve extraction however it would not be ideal in the optimization of this sampler and in the estimation of the rs for purposes of estimating twa concentrations in environmental waters which is hardly ever above a temperature of 30 c 3 2 validation and application of a passive sampling device in environmental monitoring the developed mase mip based passive sampler was validated yielding results presented in table 2 the linear regression of the of the standard calibration curves was evaluated over a range of 5 100 ng l 1 for venlafaxine and methocarbamol and at a range of 1 100 103 ng l 1 for the other pharmaceuticals the r2 values ranged from 0 9988 to 0 9998 matrix matched mdls and mqls ranged from 2 42 to 3 26 ng l 1 and 8 06 to 10 81 ng l 1 respectively identification of analytes was done on the lc qtof ms using retention times and major characteristic fragment ions summarized in table 2 the developed passive sampler was deployed for 14 days at three different sites of the orlando dam for the purposes of investigating its application ability in environmental water bodies eq 2 was used in the estimation of the twa concentrations in the dam with the aid of the rs obtained in the matrix matched calibrations of the sampler table 4 presents the results obtained it can be noted that methocarbamol was detected in all deployment sites with twa concentrations ranging from 16 99 to 72 29 ng l 1 whilst etilefrine was only detected in site 2 and 3 at twa concentrations of 8 17 and 12 88 ng l 1 respectively the other three compounds were not detected in all the deployment sites however a recent south african based study reported the occurrence of carbamazepine in klip river with concentrations less than the method detection limits of 0 094 ng ml 1 madikizela et al 2022 in singapore carbamazepine had twa concentrations ranging from 0 56 to 0 96 ng l 1 in tropical lakes and 2 8 ng l 1 in estuarine water bayen et al 2014 in a different study the bioavailable amount of venlafaxine ranged from 34 605 ng pocis 1 in surface waters of the czech republic fedorova et al 2014 in addition to the deployed samplers grab samples were collected at the deployment sites to assess any variation in concentrations when two sample preconcentration techniques are used the mase mip technique applied was optimized and validated for the extraction of these model pharmaceuticals in surface water in our previous work however none of the compounds were detected nor quantified with this method this was due to the fact that the method lods for the mase mip for the compounds detected through passive sampling ranged from 0 17 to 0 20 ng ml 1 which is much higher than the concentrations that can be quantified through the sampler mqls on table 2 this then makes the developed passive sampling technique a suitable and attractive technique for the estimations of the average trace level concentration for the targeted pharmaceuticals in environmental water bodies to the best of our knowledge this is the first study which investigated the environmentally available concentrations of these target compounds in south african waters through passive sampling technique this is also the first study which designed optimized and applied a mase mip based passive sampler for environmental monitoring of pharmaceuticals rimayi and coworkers conducted a study focused on the screening of emerging pollutants in the hennops and juskei rivers of south africa through a chemcatcher passive sampler rimayi et al 2019 carbamazepine etilefrine methocarbamol and venlafaxine were detected however their study only focused on the screening and not the quantification of these pharmaceuticals 4 conclusions a mase mip based passive sampling device was successfully designed optimized and applied in the monitoring of selected model pharmaceuticals belonging to five different therapeutic classes the optimized sampler showed ability of the usage of an ionic liquid aliquat 336 as a green receiver solvent results showed slightly reduced accumulation of target compounds onto the receiver phase which could be attributed to the viscosity of the aliquat 336 even though that was the case the sampler showed ability to be applied in the monitoring of trace environmental concentrations up to ng l 1 in surface water where methocarbamol and etilefrine trace twa concentrations were detected the optimized passive sampling device was proven to be precise efficient and an attractive alternative to conventional sampling techniques for the monitoring of trace level concentrations of the targeted compounds funding this work was financially supported by water research commission project no c2020 2021 00568 the

15451,in this work we demonstrate the development evaluation and pre liminary application of a novel passive sampler for monitoring of selected pharmaceuticals in environmental waters the samplers were calibrated in laboratory based experiments to obtain sampling rates rs for carbamazepine methocarbamol etilefrine venlafaxine and nevirapine passive sampling was based on the diffusion of the target pharmaceuticals from surface water through a membrane bag which housed an ionic liquid as a green receiving solvent and a molecularly imprinted polymer effects of biofouling deployment time and solvent type for the receiver phase were optimized for selective uptake of analytes in surface water notably there was a decrease in the uptake of selected pharmaceuticals and consequently a decrease in their sampling rates in the presence of biofouling the optimum matrix matched sampling rates ranged from 0 0007 0 0018 l d 1 whilst the method detection and quantification limits ranged from 2 45 3 26 ng l 1 and 8 06 10 81 ng l 1 respectively the optimized passive sampler was deployed in a dam situated in the heart of a typical highly populated township in the gauteng province of south africa only etilefrine and methocarbamol were detected and quantified at maximum time weighted average concentrations of 12 88 and 72 29 ng l 1 respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords passive sampling molecularly imprinted polymer membrane assisted solvent extraction pharmaceuticals aliquat 336 environmental monitoring 1 introduction globally pharmaceuticals are increasingly being used as medications for both humans and animals they are now considered an important group of persistent emerging pollutants due to being continuously detected in the aquatic environments bueno et al 2012 gogoi et al 2018 vermeirssen et al 2008 as such they have become a global concern to the scientific community owing to their detrimental health effects and microbial resistance in aquatic life gogoi et al 2018 lÃ³pez pacheco et al 2019 although they are typically available at trace levels Âµg l 1 ng l 1 or even pg l 1 in aquatic environments kÃ¼mmerer 2010 lausier 2009 their monitoring is important in the assessment of pollution and identification of pollution sources wang et al 2020 most water monitoring programmes depend on the conventional grab sampling of water at a specific time however this sampling method has drawbacks in monitoring the presence of pollutants as it only provides pollutant concentrations at the time of sampling which in most cases is not a true reflection of the extent of pollution taylor et al 2021 vrana et al 2005a wang et al 2020 for an example a south african based study has indicated an increase of 48 54 in pharmaceutical load into a wastewater treatment plant from 12 30 to 3 30 p m amdany et al 2015 which is an indication of concentration variations during the course of the day hence it is important to design an efficient sampling tool that accounts for the variations of concentrations in the environment over a short period additionally pre concentrating environmental pollutants to quantifiable concentration levels can be expensive and tedious as large sample volumes accompanied by several sample preparation steps are required bueno et al 2016 taylor et al 2021 passive sampling technique has displayed qualities of being a promising approach to traditional grab sampling for the monitoring of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments togola et al 2007 vrana et al 2021 the technique makes use of passive sampling devices which permit unprompted in situ extraction and pre concentration of analytes over longer periods of time vrana et al 2021 this then allows for time integrated or time weighted average twa concentrations of analytes which considers variations in pollutant concentrations and in turn increases the capabilities of the device to detecting and quantifying contaminants at trace levels garnier et al 2020 lohmann et al 2017 vrana et al 2005b passive samplers are simple less labouring cost effective easy to handle and nonmechanical devices which can be operated without power supply lohmann et al 2017 taylor et al 2021 an ideal sampler would normally consist of an acceptor phase and a membrane which separates the acceptor phase and the aqueous sample the acceptor phase is selected based on its ability to accept or extract target compounds from the water body verhagen et al 2020 currently the widely used and commercially available passive sampler in environmental monitoring of pharmaceuticals is the polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis consisting of a sorptive receiver phase normally covered by a microporous polyethersulphone membrane godlewska et al 2020 however recent studies have shown that the pocis is effective for qualitative analysis but has several flaws which makes it a semi quantitative tool for monitoring of pharmaceuticals taylor et al 2021 vermeirssen et al 2012 some of its weaknesses include the misunderstood accumulation mechanism and its vulnerability to physicochemical parameters like the water ph conductivity dissolved organic matter biofouling water flow and temperature booij and chen 2018 djomte et al 2018 for these reasons accumulation rates or sampling rates rs obtained from laboratory calibration of the sampler may be biased when applied in the field mÄczykowska et al 2017 currently a few studies have resorted to in situ calibrations of the pocis with the view to minimize the doubts in the estimation of the accumulated concentration garnier et al 2020 verhagen et al 2020 vrana et al 2021 this is an indication that more research is needed in the search for alternative passive samplers for monitoring of pharmaceuticals in environmental waters in this work we designed and optimized a novel alternative passive sampler based on membrane assisted solvent extraction and a molecularly imprinted polymer mase mip for monitoring of the selected model compounds in aquatic environments this was achieved by synthesizing a smart polymer and then enclosing it in a membrane bag containing a receiver solvent and finally enclosing them in a polyvinyl chloride pvc cage and deployed as a passive sampler the idea was to investigate the possibilities of using greener and stable solvents such as the deep eutectic solvents dess and ionic liquids ils as an alternative approach to the conventional organic solvents in the receiver phase of the passive sampler in recent years dess which share few properties with ils have gained a lot of interests in the various fields of analytical chemistry e g sample preparation micro extraction mass spectrometry etc santana mayor et al 2021 shishov et al 2017 the two green solvents share unique physicochemical properties such as nonflammability and low volatility moreover dess have added advantages over ils which include being eco friendly mostly biodegradable cheaper and easily produced prepared from a hydrogen bond acceptor and a hydrogen bond donor therefore good in the dissolution of pharmaceuticals santana mayor et al 2021 shishov et al 2017 the developed passive sampler is based on the diffusion of selected pharmaceuticals from surface water through the membrane bag into the green solvent receiving phase followed by the selective adsorption of analytes onto the mip cavities over a period of 14 days upon retrieval of the passive sampler from the surface water analytes were desorbed from the mip and analyzed using liquid chromatography equipped with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry detection system lc qtof ms other parameters such as the effects of biofouling and deployment time were optimized for selective uptake of analytes in surface water the passive samplers were then calibrated through matrix matched laboratory based experiments to obtain sampling rates for each target pharmaceutical for purposes of estimating twa concentrations for each pharmaceutical the target pharmaceuticals with their physicochemical properties provided in table 1 were an antidepressant venlafaxine an antiretroviral nevirapine a muscle relaxant methocarbamol an anticonvulsant carbamazepine and a cardiac stimulant etilefrine finally the mase mip based passive sampler was deployed for selective monitoring of five pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic groups in orlando dam situated in the heart of soweto township a biggest south african township in this regard this is the first study to investigate the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in orlando dam 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents analytical grade venlafaxine hydrochloride 98 carbamazepine etilefrine hydrochloride methocarbamol nevirapine and p vinylbenzoic acid 97 were all obtained in powder form while ethylene glycol dimethacrylate 98 1 octanol 99 and trioctylmethylammonium chloride aliquat 336 were obtained in liquid form from sigma aldrich johannesburg south africa uhplc grade methanol 99 9 dimethyl sulfoxide acetonitrile 99 8 toluene 99 7 and formic acid 95 were also purchased from sigma aldrich johannesburg south africa chloroform 99 and cyclohexane 99 and sodium chloride were purchased from associated chemical enterprises ace johannesburg south africa nitrogen gas was obtained from afrox johannesburg south africa 2 2 synthesis of a molecularly imprinted polymer synthesis of a mip was adopted from our previous work khulu et al 2022a to synthesize the smart polymer 15 mg of the template venlafaxine was dissolved in 3 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide at 40 c for 5 min while stirring 30 mg of p vinyl benzoic acid functional monomer was added into the mixture while heating for a further 10 min the reaction mixture temperature was then raised to 60 c and 167 Âµl of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate cross linker was added to the reaction while stirring and heating for further 10 min an initiator 1 1 azobis cyclohexanecarbonitrile 10 mg was added to the mixture and the system was purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min finally the reaction temperature was then raised to 80 c to achieve polymerization mip cavities were generated by washing the polymer excessively with methanol for removal of the template this synthetic approach has been previously reported to result in the formation of a mip that is selective to the five target pharmaceuticals khulu et al 2022a 2022b this was due to cross selectivity resulting from interactions occurring between the functional groups of pharmaceuticals and the functional monomer p vinylbenzoic acid in this case interactions occurred through hydrogen bonding taking place between the oxygen of the hydroxyl group or the nitrogen of the target compounds and the hydrogen of the carboxylic group of the functional monomer other anticipated interactions were Ï Ï interactions based on the benzene rings also the size of venlafaxine used as the template molecule ensured that the created cavities allowed for entrance and subsequent binding of targeted pharmaceuticals which are all smaller than the template onto the mip this excluded the bigger molecules from accessing the mip cavities furthermore other smaller compounds which could have been loosely bound on the mip cavities get eliminated during the washing step this step has been found to play a significant role in eliminating interferences during the molecular recognition process mbhele et al 2018 zunngu et al 2017 therefore the synthesized mip displayed high affinity towards all the five model pharmaceuticals with maximum matrix matched adsorption capacities ranging between 206 and 418 ng mg 1 for individual pharmaceuticals moreover the mip could be re used up to four times without losing its high binding affinity towards target pharmaceuticals fig 1 gives a general illustration of the mip synthesis procedure 2 3 instrumentation and apparatus a temperature controlled wisecube wig 105 precise shaking incubator supplied by wisd laboratory instruments wertheim bw germany was used for template removal from the mip samples were centrifuged through a rotofix 32a centrifuge from hettich frankfurt hessen germany polypropylene membrane bags 4 cm long 0 03 mm wall thickness 6 mm internal diameter were purchased from chemetrix export johannesburg south africa empty spe cartridges with a 1 ml capacity and 6 mm diameter fitted with 10 Âµm frits at the bottom were purchased from anatech instruments johannesburg south africa deionized water was produced through a millipore directq 3 uv waters system 2345 from millipore massachusetts usa the magnetic stirrer used in deployment experiments was purchased from c c imelmann pty ltd johannesburg south africa the spe vacuum manifold was purchased from phenomex carlifornia usa whilst the vacuum pump was purchased from gilson williers le bel france the hi98194 multiparamer meter used for in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters was purchased from hanna instruments johannesburg south africa the uhplc system used for separation and analysis of pharmaceuticals was the thermo scientific dionex ultimate 3000 from themofisher scientific waltham ma usa the instrument consisted of a hpg 3200rs pump and a wps 3000trs autosampler the uhplc was coupled to a quadrupole time of flight compact mass spectrometer system from bruker daltonics inc billerica ma usa for collection and processing of qualitative data bruker compass dataanalysis version 4 3 build 110 102 1532 was used while bruker compass quantanalysis version 4 3 build 110 102 1532 was utilized for collection and processing of quantitative data chromatographic separation of analytes was achieved on a luna omega c18 column 50 4 6 mm 3 Î¼m from phenomenex torrance ca usa separation was through gradient elution using solvent a 0 1 formic acid in deionized water and solvent b 0 1 formic acid in acetonitrile all five pharmaceuticals were separated within 14 min initially solvent b was kept at 5 for 1 min this was followed by gradually increasing the amount of solvent b until it reached 55 at 6 min and kept constant for 2 min the amount of solvent b was further increased gradually until it reached 95 at 10 min and kept constant for further 2 min finally the amount of solvent b was dropped to 5 for a minute and kept constant for another minute khulu et al 2022a 2 4 development of a mase mip based passive sampler 2 4 1 mase preparation pre conditioning of extraction membranes was achieved by immersing the polypropylene membranes into a beaker containing cyclohexane and shaking at 150 rpm for approximately 3 h this step was repeated 3 times with clean portions of cyclohexane the metal cylinders were not removed from the membrane bag during the procedure to ensure that the inside walls of the membranes were also conditioned after pre conditioning the membrane bags were dried out and then soaked in the extraction solvent i e chloroform des or il for at least 2 h 2 4 2 design and preparation of mase mip based passive sampler the passive sampler device was designed and machined in house using a cost effective pvc pipe purchased from a local hardware supermarket the pvc pipe consisted of a top and bottom cap the latter was glued to the bottom of the pipe by pvc glue the length of the sampler chamber was 10 cm with internal diameter of 5 5 cm the sampler chamber was drilled to create multiple holes as shown on fig 2 a which became essential for the flow of water mip particles 50 mg were transferred into the interior of the polypropylene membrane bag the bag was filled with 1 ml of receiver solution solvent the membrane bag containing a mixture of mip particles and receiver solution was then tied with a cotton string as a means of temporary sealing the bag was then placed inside the chamber the chamber can fit 5 to 6 propylene membrane bags for laboratory deployments the mase mip based passive samplers were placed in a 5 l glass beaker containing 3 l of either deionized or dam water spiked with 1 104 ng l 1 of target pharmaceutical compounds as shown in fig 2b after extraction the mip and the acceptor solution mixture was transferred into a 1 ml empty spe cartridge fitted with a 10 Âµm frit at the bottom and then mounted onto an spe vacuum manifold the receiver solution was allowed to flow through the spe cartridge and discarded while safeguarding against any mip particle losses by means of frits the mip was then washed with 1 ml chloroform to eliminate interferences and then a steady vacuum was then applied by means of external vacuum pump to dry the mip particles then the adsorbed pharmaceuticals were eluted from the mip cavities using 4 1 ml of methanol for environmental monitoring the solvent extracts were reduced to 1 ml by purging with a gentle stream of nitrogen gas prior to injection to the lc qtof ms for identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals 2 5 optimization of extraction parameters 2 5 1 effect of acceptor phase in this step the aim was to adapt conditions from our previous work khulu et al 2022b where chloroform was used as an organic receiver phase however owing to chloroform s volatility it was not possible to apply it as an receiver solvent for long extraction periods chloroform volatilized to dryness within two to three days of deployment this raised a need to explore more stable low volatility and environmentally friendly solvents in this regard a des prepared by mixing methyltrioctylammonium chloride aliquat 336 and 1 octanol in a ratio of 50 50 v v and an ionic liquid aliquat 336 were investigated as possible extraction solvents des preparation followed the same method described by tang and colleagues where aliquat 336 1 octanol were mixed in a 1 1 ratio in a glass vial and heated at a temperature of 80 c with constant stirring at 350 rpm for 2 h to form a homogenous mixture tang et al 2018 to assess the effect of solvent type a polypropylene membrane bag was filled with 50 mg mip particles and 1 ml of either the des or the il and then tied with a cotton string thereafter 5 l glass beakers were filled with 3 l of deionized water spiked with 2 104 ng l 1 of the selected model pharmaceuticals thereafter the prepared passive samplers based on either des or il as an acceptor solvent were deployed in the spiked solutions each passive sampler chamber consisted of four membrane bags and on day 1 3 5 and 7 a membrane bag was retrieved from each passive sampler chamber and treated using the method explained in 2 4 3 prior to lc qtof ms analysis these experiments were done in triplicates also on each of those days a 0 5 ml sample of donor phase was sampled and taken to lc qtof ms for analysis 2 5 2 effect of exposure time and biofouling effect of exposure time and biofouling was conducted in order to understand the accumulation of the selected model pharmaceuticals onto the sampling device during the time of deployment sampling rates were estimated using eq 1 1 r s m s c w t where rs is the sampling rate l d 1 ms is the mass of analytes accumulated in the receiving phase ng cw is the mean water concentration ng l 1 t is the deployment time days extraction of targeted pharmaceuticals was done in a period of 14 days where a passive sampler chamber containing six membrane bags with acceptor phase mixture was immersed at about 10 cm deep into a 5 l glass beaker containing 3 l of deionized spiked with 1 104 ng l 1 of analytes on day 1 3 5 9 11 and 14 a single membrane bag was removed from each deployment system followed by desorption of analytes from mip and their analysis with lc qtof ms additionally on each of those days a 0 5 ml sample of aqueous sample was sampled and taken to lc qtof ms for analysis these experiments were done in triplicate furthermore a second laboratory scale calibration of the sampler was done using environmental surface water sampled from florida lake gauteng south africa 26 1739 s 27 8971 e this environmental surface water was initially analyzed for the presence of the target pharmaceuticals using an analytical method that was previously developed by our research group khulu et al 2022b none of the target pharmaceuticals were found in water samples from florida lake the purpose of performing this calibration with an environmental sample was to investigate the effect of biofouling on the passive sampler sampling rates with the view to understand the behavior of the sampler in the environment this was achieved by immersing the passive sampler into the glass beaker containing 3 l of the water spiked with 1 104 ng l 1 of analytes and stirring the system at 100 rpm the experiments were done in triplicate over a period of 14 days the ph of the water at the time of sampling was 7 36 and a temperature of 25 1 c which is equivalent to room temperature calculations of the sampling rates were done using eq 1 2 6 study site and field deployment of passive samplers the passive samplers were deployed at the orlando dam 26 2561 s 27 9222 e situated in soweto a highly populated and biggest south african township located in the gauteng province this dam is situated in the downstream of a big government owned hospital a private hospital and a shopping mall fig 3 orlando dam receives water from the baileyspruit and diepkloofspruit streams which both cut through the highly populated soweto township the dam serves as recreational fishing dam as utilized by the members of the community during the time of deployment and retrieval of passive sampler the dam was found to be surrounded by hyacinth and other vegetation which is a sign of eutrophication a study by bengu and colleagues reported a presence of nitrites nitrates phosphates and faecal coliform bacteria in the orlando dam surface water bengu et al 2017 in the present study three passive sampling devices were deployed in three parts of the orlando dam fig 3 these three sites were the most accessible and conducive part of the dam for passive sampling physicochemical parameters such ph 7 74 conductivity 485 Âµs cm 1 total dissolved solids 243 mg l 1 and temperature 27 6 c were all measured in situ at the time of deployment water from this dam pours into the klipspruit stream a stream which has been documented in reports by the water research commission and the city of johannesburg as being highly impacted by sewage discharge bengu et al 2017 the passive samplers were deployed in orlando dam for 14 days the period at which samplers were operating at the integrative regime for estimation of twa concentrations of the targeted pharmaceuticals eq 2 was used 2 c w c s m s r s t

grabbed into pre cleaned plastic bottles from orlando dam and transported into the laboratory in a cooler box for further preparation the samples were filtered through 0 22 Âµm syringe filters merck johannesburg south africa followed by pre treatment with a mase mip technique developed and validated in our previous work khulu et al 2022b the sample vial consisted of 18 ml water sample saturated in 5 g sodium chloride and a propylene membrane bag filled with 1 ml chloroform and 50 mg of mip the samples were stirred at 400 rpm for a duration of 60 minutes to allow for extraction of targeted compounds thereafter the contents of the membrane bag were transferred into 1 ml empty spe cartridge with 10 Âµm frits at the bottom and mounted onto an spe manifold chloroform was allowed to flow through the spe cartridge utilizing a gravitational force and sent to waste a steady vacuum was then applied to dry the mip particles followed by elution of analytes with 4 1 ml of methanol after which the extracts were combined and reduced to 1 ml by gentle purging with nitrogen gas and then finally taken to the lc qtof ms for chromatographic determination and quantification this step was conducted to check for any variability in the results obtained by mase mip and the passive sampler 3 results and discussions 3 1 optimization of extraction conditions 3 1 1 acceptor phase in this step we investigated the solvent type on the extraction of target compounds upon discovering that chloroform could not be utilized as an extraction solvent for long term a des aliquat 336 1 octanol on a 1 1 ratio and an il aliquat 336 were investigated as suitable solvents these solvents with their chemical structures given in fig 4 were chosen based on their stability and their ability to allow for hydrogen bonding however in the mase mip technique an effective solvent should allow for both the movement of analytes across the polypropylene membrane as well as not interfere with their binding onto the mip cavities chimuka et al 2011 fig 5 demonstrates accumulated amount of each target pharmaceutical on the mip using the three tested solvents during the 7 days of deployment from the figure it can be noted that the extraction of target pharmaceuticals by chloroform could only be achieved over a period of two days as it would have completely evaporated by the end of day three it was also noted that target pharmaceuticals were extracted and transported better using aliquat 336 this is possibly due to the interactions taking place between the chloride of aliquat 336 and the hydrogen atom of the amide and or hydroxyl functional groups present in the target pharmaceuticals chemical structures provided in table 1 also electrostatic interactions are expected to occur between the nitrogen ion present in aliquat 336 and oxygen of the pharmaceutical compounds this also means that the movement of analytes from the solvent to the mip cavities was more pronounced with aliquat 336 than it was with the des even though literature suggests that dess are good in the dissolution of pharmaceuticals due to their excellent physicochemical properties dai et al 2013 shishov et al 2017 tang et al 2017 it can be noted that the dess would have been utilized in direct contact with the aqueous sample e g liquid liquid extraction for an example tang and coworkers extracted two antibiotics from environmental water through liquid liquid microextraction with an aid of the same des tang et al 2018 in the present study there is a protective layer offered by the polypropylene membrane bag between the sample and the extraction also the extraction takes place in two stages therefore based on the results obtained further experiments were conducted with aliquat 336 as an extraction solvent 3 1 2 effect of exposure time and biofouling to be able to determine time weighted concentrations of analytes in environmental water determination of accumulation rates sampling rates onto the mip cavities is paramount during the deployment period the accumulation of analytes onto the sampler sorbent can be described in three regimes the first one is the linear regime the second is the curvilinear regime and the third one is the equilibrium regime the linear regime is the range at which sampling rates are calculated this parameter can be affected by a number of factors which can include biofouling turbulence temperature ph and diffusion of analytes through the membrane garnier et al 2020 in this work the water ph was adjusted to 7 5 and the system was stirred at 100 rpm with the aim of mimicking environmental water ph and dam water hydrodynamic conditions in some cases the stirring rate influences the partitioning of analytes from donor to receiver phase quintana and reemtsma 2006 however in the case of compounds with logkow 3 same as the target compounds table 1 not much gain can be obtained by increasing the stirring rate nyoni et al 2011 this phenomenon was proven to be true in the case of the target pharmaceuticals where increasing the stirring rate from 400 rpm to 1200 rpm did not have a positive effect on their extraction process khulu et al 2022b this is because our target pharmaceuticals have a logkow 3 ranging from 0 1 2 9 table 1 the samplers were immersed in a beaker containing 1 104 ng l 1 of each target pharmaceutical and their accumulation on the mip cavities was measured over a period of 14 days good linear regressions were obtained for all compounds fig 6 with r2 values ranging from 0 9782 to 0 9924 the sampling rates were determined through eq 1 using the slope ms t 1 of the linear regression plot and the concentration in the water cw the rs values l d 1 obtained table 2 ranged from 0 0009 to 0 0028 for individual pharmaceuticals these values assisted in understanding the volume of water that can be extracted by the passive sampler per day acceptable precision for triplicate results was indicated by relative standard deviation ranging from 5 1 7 9 in order to understand and estimate the uptake rates of the passive sampler in environmental water another laboratory scale matrix matched calibration was conducted the purpose of conducting the matrix matched calibrations was to estimate sampling rates that are closer to field sampling rates and to understand the effect of biofouling on the uptake of target pharmaceuticals in this instance the accumulation of pharmaceuticals on the mip cavities was measured over a period of 14 days good linear regressions fig 7 with good correlation values ranging from 0 9715 to 0 9910 were obtained the rs values attained ranged from 0 0007 to 0 0018 l d 1 triplicate results yielded relative standard deviation ranging from 7 9 13 5 from fig 7 it can be observed that the accumulation of target compounds was affected by biofouling a drop in the accumulation could have been caused by slowed down diffusion of analytes through the polypropylene membrane bag as biofouling accumulated on the membrane surface over time of all the targeted pharmaceuticals carbamazepine is the most investigated compound in passive sampling based studies table 3 gives a summary of the studied compounds and their estimated sampling rates it is well noted that there is quite a variation in the sampling rates for individual compounds which is attributed to the different parameters under which the sampler calibrations were carried bayen and coworkers table 3 estimated different sampling rates for the same compound when calibration was carried under different physicochemical conditions bayen et al 2014 this then emphasizes a need for calibration of samplers at conditions closer to the environmental conditions of the chosen deployment site in the present study the sampling rates are observed to be lower than those reported in literature which could be due to several factors one factor could be the type of membrane used in the present study as this influences the permeation of compounds into the receiver phase another factor could be the density of the applied receiver solvent this observation has been reported by bayen and coworkers where they observed a variation in sampling rates for the same compound due to several factors bayen et al 2014 in this case carrying out the experiments at temperatures higher than the ambient temperature could reduce the viscosity of solvent and in turn improve extraction however it would not be ideal in the optimization of this sampler and in the estimation of the rs for purposes of estimating twa concentrations in environmental waters which is hardly ever above a temperature of 30 c 3 2 validation and application of a passive sampling device in environmental monitoring the developed mase mip based passive sampler was validated yielding results presented in table 2 the linear regression of the of the standard calibration curves was evaluated over a range of 5 100 ng l 1 for venlafaxine and methocarbamol and at a range of 1 100 103 ng l 1 for the other pharmaceuticals the r2 values ranged from 0 9988 to 0 9998 matrix matched mdls and mqls ranged from 2 42 to 3 26 ng l 1 and 8 06 to 10 81 ng l 1 respectively identification of analytes was done on the lc qtof ms using retention times and major characteristic fragment ions summarized in table 2 the developed passive sampler was deployed for 14 days at three different sites of the orlando dam for the purposes of investigating its application ability in environmental water bodies eq 2 was used in the estimation of the twa concentrations in the dam with the aid of the rs obtained in the matrix matched calibrations of the sampler table 4 presents the results obtained it can be noted that methocarbamol was detected in all deployment sites with twa concentrations ranging from 16 99 to 72 29 ng l 1 whilst etilefrine was only detected in site 2 and 3 at twa concentrations of 8 17 and 12 88 ng l 1 respectively the other three compounds were not detected in all the deployment sites however a recent south african based study reported the occurrence of carbamazepine in klip river with concentrations less than the method detection limits of 0 094 ng ml 1 madikizela et al 2022 in singapore carbamazepine had twa concentrations ranging from 0 56 to 0 96 ng l 1 in tropical lakes and 2 8 ng l 1 in estuarine water bayen et al 2014 in a different study the bioavailable amount of venlafaxine ranged from 34 605 ng pocis 1 in surface waters of the czech republic fedorova et al 2014 in addition to the deployed samplers grab samples were collected at the deployment sites to assess any variation in concentrations when two sample preconcentration techniques are used the mase mip technique applied was optimized and validated for the extraction of these model pharmaceuticals in surface water in our previous work however none of the compounds were detected nor quantified with this method this was due to the fact that the method lods for the mase mip for the compounds detected through passive sampling ranged from 0 17 to 0 20 ng ml 1 which is much higher than the concentrations that can be quantified through the sampler mqls on table 2 this then makes the developed passive sampling technique a suitable and attractive technique for the estimations of the average trace level concentration for the targeted pharmaceuticals in environmental water bodies to the best of our knowledge this is the first study which investigated the environmentally available concentrations of these target compounds in south african waters through passive sampling technique this is also the first study which designed optimized and applied a mase mip based passive sampler for environmental monitoring of pharmaceuticals rimayi and coworkers conducted a study focused on the screening of emerging pollutants in the hennops and juskei rivers of south africa through a chemcatcher passive sampler rimayi et al 2019 carbamazepine etilefrine methocarbamol and venlafaxine were detected however their study only focused on the screening and not the quantification of these pharmaceuticals 4 conclusions a mase mip based passive sampling device was successfully designed optimized and applied in the monitoring of selected model pharmaceuticals belonging to five different therapeutic classes the optimized sampler showed ability of the usage of an ionic liquid aliquat 336 as a green receiver solvent results showed slightly reduced accumulation of target compounds onto the receiver phase which could be attributed to the viscosity of the aliquat 336 even though that was the case the sampler showed ability to be applied in the monitoring of trace environmental concentrations up to ng l 1 in surface water where methocarbamol and etilefrine trace twa concentrations were detected the optimized passive sampling device was proven to be precise efficient and an attractive alternative to conventional sampling techniques for the monitoring of trace level concentrations of the targeted compounds funding this work was financially supported by water research commission project no c2020 2021 00568 the

15452,eutrophication and algal blooms have become global issues the drinking water treatment process suffers from pollution by algal organic matter aom through cell lysis during the algal blooms nevertheless it remains unclear how aom invasion affects water quality and microbial communities in drinking water particularly in the stagnant settings in this study the addition of aom caused the residual chlorine to rapidly degrade and below the limit of 0 05 mg l while the no2 n concentration ranged from 0 11 to 3 71 mg l additionally total bacterial counts increased and subsequently decreased the results of biolog demonstrated that the aom significantly improved the utilization capacity of carbon sources and changed the preference for carbon sources full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and network modeling revealed a considerable reduction in the abundance of proteobacteria whereas that of bacteroidetes increased significantly under the influence of aom furthermore the species abundance distributions of the microcystis group and scenedesmus group was most consistent with the mandelbrot model according to redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling the bacterial community structure of the control group was most positively regulated by the free residual chlorine concentrations whereas the microcystis group and scenedesmus group were positively correlated with the total organic carbon toc concentration overall these findings provide a scientific foundation for the evolution of drinking water quality under algae bloom pollution graphical

do not have permission to share data 1 introduction reservoirs are among the most important water sources for countries and play a vital role in the safety of public drinking water zhang et al 2022c however in the context of global warming reservoirs face the challenge of eutrophication which can result in unpleasant odors algal toxins and the death of aquatic organisms gobler 2020 huang et al 2022 liu et al 2022 drinking water treatment plants dwtps are also be affected by algal blooms causing the deterioration in water quality and the invasion of algal organic matter aom such as the green soup incident at a reservoir in hubei province china janssen 2019 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 many studies have shown that the organic matter negatively impacts water quality and the microbial ecosystems shi et al 2022 wood 2016 yet the removal of organic matter using traditional processes i e coagulated sedimented and disinfected is unsatisfactory prest et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 therefore it is critical to investigate the impact of organic matter on drinking water drinking water pipe systems are susceptible to microorganisms lautenschlager et al 2010 in recent years the effects of organic matter on microorganisms have been widely studied biodegradable organic matter bom in pipes can degrade the biostability of drinking water and lead to the regeneration of pathogenic bacteria which significantly determines the growth potential of microorganisms in drinking water kasuga et al 2020 cyanobacteria can produce large amounts of organic matter and phytotoxins that affect water safety during algal blooms in reservoirs zhang et al 2014 to date many studies have shown that natural organic matter nom could be a source of a variety of drinking water issues including bacterial growth in distribution systems rantanen et al 2020 volk et al 2002 yao et al 2022 aom which mainly consists of amino acids proteinaceous materials and carbohydrates is released as a metabolic by product or a result of cell lysis during water treatment dong et al 2021 wang et al 2019 however however reports regarding the effects of aom on bacterial activity and water quality in drinking water remain rare consequently the response mechanism of microbial ecology to aom in the drinking water pipe systems requires further study drinking water quality and microbial ecology are also influenced by pipe material kelley et al 2014 plumbing age dias et al 2019 stagnant time zlatanovic et al 2017 and organic content pivokonsky et al 2015 stagnation of drinking water in pipelines is unavoidable studies concerning plumbing in buildings have shown that the cell concentration in stagnant water increases with the length of stagnation and amount of biofilm in the pipe lautenschlager et al 2010 proctor et al 2017 compared with fresh water stagnant water contributes to bacterial growth and microorganism metabolism including cell proliferation in drinking water distribution systems dwds zhang et al 2022a 2021c 2015 furthermore many studies have indicated that stagnation can increase the number of microorganisms and cause the survival patterns of bacterial communities to become more intricate chen et al 2020b zhang et al 2022a nevertheless there have been few studies surrounding the microbiological changes in stagnant water polluted by aom therefore additional research is required to determine the combined effects of stagnation and aom on the microbial ecosystems in drinking water pipes to this end the primary goal of this study was to investigate the water quality as well as the quantity activity and community structure of bacteria in the drinking water pipelines under the influence of aom and stagnation the specific objectives were 1 to inspect the water quality under the influence of aom and stagnation 2 to analyze the various characteristics of the bacteria in terms of quantity activity and community structure in the pipelines under the pollution of exogenous aom and 3 to assess the relationships between the bacterial community and essential water factors through various statistical techniques this study provides new insights into the evolution of drinking water quality and microbial biological characteristics during algal blooms thereby providing a scientific basis for drinking water safety protection 2 materials and methods 2 1 aom preparation galvanized pipes with the same specifications dn40 and materials as indoor drinking water pipelines were used in this study the algae species microcystis

then mixed and heated for 20 s and the luminescence was measured immediately the concentration of free atp was determined through a 0 1 mm sterile syringe filter heaion tianjin china and then subtracted from the total atp concentration in each sample to generate the intracellular atp concentrations lautenschlager et al 2010 2 4 metabolic activity of bacterial community the metabolic

statistical analysis line and bar charts were drawn by origin 2019 software r software version 3 6 1 was used to create a species abundance distribution sad model wu et al 2019a to examine the connection between microbial communities redundancy analysis rda and co occurrence network analysis were performed using canoco v 4 5 and r software v 3 6 1 respectively huang et al 2019 r software v

was examined using circos software http circos ca and the correlation between environmental conditions and bacteria was evaluated using structural equation modeling sem zhang et al 2022c 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation in water quality characteristics as shown in fig 1 a compared with the control group 0 12 mg l the free chlorine concentration decreased significantly at 0 h under the influence of aom 0 06 mg l within 12 h of stagnation the free chlorine concentration in three groups had decreased to 0 02 mg l which is lower than the limit of 0 05 mg l in the hygienic standard for drinking water gb5746 2006 fig 1b shows that the concentration of total residual chlorine decreased continuously with stagnant time for the control group this decreased was from 0 27 mg l to 0 07 mg l within 48 h in addition after 48 h both the microcystis group mg and scenedesmus group sg levels were below 0 05 mg l thus the invasion of aom accelerated the decay of free chlorine drinking water quality was ensured by residual chlorine which controlled microbial reproduction and ensured water safety previous research has revealed that temperature stagnation time ph metal corrosion and organic matter all play roles in chlorine degradation for example the organic supplementation enhances the level of free residue chlorine required for biofilm management at 6 c considerably ndiongue et al 2005 furthermore chlorine interacts with other elements to generate trichloromethane thms and other disinfection by products which were harmful to human health variations in no3 n nh4 n and no2 n concentrations with stagnation time are presented in fig 2 at 0 h the no3 n concentration 4 95 mg l in mg was lower than that 5 61 mg l in sg fig 2a in contrast the concentration of nh4 n in mg was higher than that in sg fig 2c compared with that at 0 h the concentration of no2 n in mg and sg at 120 h increased by 30 8 and 31 4 times respectively fig 2b with an increase in stagnant time the concentration of no3 n in the three groups showed a continuous decrease falling by 34 30 50 00 and 66 94 respectively the concentration of nh4 n in the control group increased before 18 h and peaked at 0 42 mg l and then began to decline and stabilize after 24 h in mg the nh4 n concentration increased with stagnant time reached 0 56 mg l after 120 h and increased by 117 78 from 0 h in sg nh4 n concentration also increased with stagnant time peaked by 72 h 0 45 mg l and then started to fall nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria are widely distributed in the drinking water pipeline systems golaki et al 2022 ma et al 2022b in the early stages of stagnation ammonifiers led to the transformation of organic nitrogen in drinking water into nh4 n and reached a peak at 18 h at this time the no2 n concentration began to accumulate because nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria began to dominate in addition the no3 n concentration continued to decrease during the stagnation process which might have been due to the effects of denitrifying bacteria pressman et al 2012 zhang et al 2022b 2023 according to a previous report the chlorination could retard but not entirely prevent denitrification and the concentration of no2 n would accumulate obvious at 30 c yu et al 2009 during the stagnation of drinking water pipes certain functional microorganisms decompose proteins into ammonia nitrogen which is transformed into no3 n and no2 n by nitrifying bacteria nitrate reductase which is released during the process converted nitrate to nitrite and promotes such nitrite formation ma et al 2022a furthermore the electron acceptor competition for the carbon source of nitrate and nitrite would cause the accumulation of nitrite and the inhibition of nitrite reduction because of nitrate existence guo et al 2009 verbaendert et al 2011 the tp concentrations in the three groups showed a declining trend in fig 2d aom witha high phosphorus content is one of the most important nutrients for microorganism development and metabolism therefore a decrease in the concentration of tp might be due to microbes absorbing phosphorus jeon et al 2014 one of the main reasons for the decrease in phosphorus concentration in drinking water is the adsorption of pipe iron and minerals on phosphorus chardon et al 2022 the toc concentration decreased with stagnation time fig 2e compared with 0 h the toc concentrations of the control group mg and sg at 120 h decreased by 82 66 53 97 and 55 35 respectively aom has a complex composition with high heterogeneity including proteins lipids polysaccharides free amino acids nucleic acids algal toxins and odorants hua et al 2019 the fe concentration increased considerably with stagnant time fig 2f after 48 h the addition of aom inhibited fe release but there was no discernible change beyond72 h fe bacteria can grow at a high fe concentration which could deteriorate the chroma and produce an odor yang et al 2014 additionally the organic compounds had a stabilizing effect on fe in iron materials because organic compounds encouraged the enrichment of bacteria which were associated with fe metabolism such as bacteroides dok59 and methanosarcina wang et al 2021a the composition of organic materials in the three groups was displayed in figs s1 s3 tyrosine was present in the control group in minor amounts but it was converted to humic acid after 6 h and the peak vanished after 12 h tryptophan fulvic acid humic acid and aromatic proteins constituted a majority of the organic matter in the mg after 24 h the fulvic acid humic acid and aromatic proteins were rapidly digested wang et al 2014 3 2 diversity of biomass and bio activity fig 3 a shows the hpc modification rule for the three groups the total number of bacteria increased and then decreased over time the stagnant time in the control group peaked at 12 h the mg peaked at 18 h and the sg peaked at 24 h with 3 170 52 500 and 44 000 cfu ml respectively it is possible that after a period of stagnation organic matter and other elements in drinking water are rapidly consumed thus limiting bacterial regeneration liang et al 2021 the results of fcm are shown in fig 3b the total number of cells detected included both culturable and unculturable cells with stagnation time the total number of cells in the control group increased from 0 12 105 cells ml at 0 h to 3 05 105 cells ml at 18 h and then decreased by 48 h the total number of bacterial cells in the mg increased from 0 41 105 cells ml at 0 h to 48 39 105 cells ml at 18 h and decreased to 14 47 105 cells ml by 120 h in sg the cell number increased from 0 86 105 cells ml at 0 h to 67 27 105 cells ml at 72 h thendecreased to 1 43 105 cells ml by 120 h similar findings had been reported in earlier researches prest et al 2014 zlatanoviÄ et al 2018 the intact cell count increased initially before decreasing with stagnation time and reached its maximum value at 48 h zlatanovic et al 2017 the microbial count in bottled drinking water was also increased dramatically in the first six days after packing but slowly thereafter lesaulnier et al 2017 these phenomena may be the result of the addition of organic matter which consumes free chlorine and controls the growth of microbes in drinking water allowing them to regenerate rapidly during the initial stages of stagnation on the other hand the tendency of the concentration to increase to decrease might due to the growth of bacteria being limited by the concentration of organic matter fig 3c and 3d show that both the total atp and intracellular atp concentrations first increased and then decreased with stagnation time the total atp concentration in drinking water greatly increased owing to the presence of aom and it was greater in the mg than in the sg for both total atp and intracellular atp concentrations the intracellular atp concentrations in control group and mg peaked at 18 h which increased by 4 41 and 3 28 times compared at 0 h respectively the increase in intracellular atp content suggests that cells might transition from low nucleic acid cells to high nucleic acid cells during stagnation and bacterial cells might alter themselves in response to the external environment at a later stage of stagnation 3 3 carbon source metabolic activity analysis the biolog technique was used to analyze the carbon source metabolism ability of microorganisms wang et al 2021b as shown in fig 4 a awcd 590nm increased rapidly within 72 h of stagnation the addition of aom greatly increased the awcd 590nm signifying that it accelerated the metabolic activity kumar et al 2020 principal component analysis was performed on bacterial carbon source metabolism as shown in fig 4b there were significant differences in the characteristics of bacterial carbon source metabolism among the three groups the control group showed a negative relationship with principal component 1 whereas mg and sg showed a positive relationship with principal component 1 additionally there were variations across the groups in the microbial preferences for carbon sources fig 4c the most commonly used carbon sources in the control group were d galactose gamma lactone and methyl pyruvate mg and sg could employ most of the carbon sources while the glycogen d l a glycerol phenylethylamine and d galacturonic acid in mg were not readily utilized the utilization of methyl pyruvate d galactose gamma lactone d glucosamine itaconic acid and Î± butyric acid in sg was weak in general the control group used alcohol as a carbon sources more efficiently the addition of aom promoted the utilization of carbon sources by bacteria and the degree of utilization of different carbon sources varied interestingly the ability of bacteria to metabolize alcohols decreased after the addition of scenedesmus organic matter this could be explained by the fact that the utilization of various carbon sources by bacteria is adaptable to changes in environmental conditions the biolog is a promising technique for physiological community characterization that reveals the metabolic processes carried out by bacteria as well as their potential for use as carbon substrates gionchetta et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a as shown in fig 5 the network was used to examine the relationship between each carbon source in the 31 groups r 0 6 p 0 05 in the control group there was a negative correlation between glucose 1 phosphate phenylethylamine and the other carbon sources compared with the control group the network complexity of mg was decreased while the compactness was increased whereas d l a glycerol 2 hydroxybenzoic acid and n acetyl d glucamine were negatively correlated with other carbon sources table s1 in comparison to the control group the network of sg complexity network increased while its compactness decreased resulting in a positive connection between carbon sources wu et al 2021 3 4 bacterial community structure and composition the richness and diversity indices of the three groups are shown in table 1 the number of otus was 1164 920 and 2070 respectively the number of otus of mg were fewer than those of the control group because the metabolites of algae might inhibit the growth and metabolism of some bacteria petrovic and simonic 2015 at the same time the presence of aom might induce bacteria to produce new dominant phyla by changing water quality and thus inhibit other competing microorganisms compared with the control group the bumber of otus in sg were remarkably increased indicating that the bacterial community structure became richer under the stimulation of organic matter in scenedesmus the difference between the mg and sg due tothe different types of organic matter filippini et al 2019 the abundance of each sample species at the phylum level is shown in fig s6 it showed that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the two most prevalent phyla with the addition of aom the relative abundance of proteobacteria in drinking water decreased considerably however after adding aom the relative abundance of bacteroidetes considerably rose in general proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant during stagnation whereas the addition of aom affected the structure of the microbial community particularly that of bacteroidetes previous research has indicated that proteobacteria represent the most abundant bacteria in stagnant water 60 80 zlatanovic et al 2017 a recent study has shown that bacteroidetes are adept at disassembling complex organisms munoz et al 2020 bacteroidetes have a surrounding material space and provide a protective zone for degradation such as oligosaccharides preventing enzymes and degradation products from diffusing and vanishing thus bacteroidetes can increase its community abundance because of its ability to create a defense system in the organic environments the bacterial communities of the three groups were diverse at the genus level fig 6 a after 120 h of stagnation novosphingobium sp methyloversatilis sp sphingobium sp and ralstonia sp were dominant in the control group accounted for 41 72 14 90 6 47 and 6 14 of the total respectively under the influence of aom the abundances of novosphingobium sp methyloversatilis sp sphingobium sp and ralstonia sp were decreased in contrast the abundances of azonexus sp bosea sp flectobacillus sp and blastomonas sp was increased notably although the relative abundances of novosphingobium sp and methyloversatilis sp decreased they were still dominant in the sg and mg azonexus sp and janthinobacterium sp appeared only in the mg whereas flectobacillus sp was found only in sg in addition the general trend is similar to that shown in fig s7 previous research has indicated that the novosphingobium sp have a greater ability to degrade microcystins they also have the characteristics of complex and diverse metabolic types and strong adaptability chen et al 2020a in addition novosphingobium sp is an excellent bioreactor for aromatics pollution because of its ability to degrade aromatic compounds hashimoto et al 2010 notomista et al 2011 consequently novosphingobium sp constituted the majority of the community azonexus sp is a widespread nitrate reducing bacterium that thrives in nutrient rich and anaerobic settings chou et al 2008 wu et al 2019b previous studies have pointed out that azonexus sp is the main functional microorganism for nitrate nitrogen reduction in the presence of fe â± klueglein and kappler 2013 nordhoff et al 2017 flectobacillus sp is a common gram negative bacteria strain that increased cell size for defend against predators the growth of flectobacillus sp is promoted under the stress of viruses and heterotrophic giardia which could increase the availability of substrates simek et al 2007 bosea sp has been found to remove nitrite by heterotrophic nitrification and removes nitrite more efficiently under anoxic conditions rather than aerobic conditions xiang et al 2022 overall greater consideration should be given to the microbiological safety risk of portable water contaminated by algae bloom as this could potentially be of concern to human health relationships between microorganisms in drinking water at the genus level were investigated using network analysis fig 6b bosea sp devosia sp pelomonas sp blastomonas sp and ensifer sp had favorable correlations with one another among the eight modules that were categorized pesudomonas sp and bradyrhizobium sp comamonas sp and lacibacter sp brevundimonas sp and sphingomonas sp all exhibited negative relationships sad analysis was used to analyze the drinking water bacterial model fig 7 the lower the aic value the closer it was to the distribution model the most suitable model for microorganisms in the control group was the lognormal model aic 642 58 which expresses the community dynamics as a random zero sum process in other words the size of the community barely changed and the disappearance of units would be supplemented by other units after the addition of aom the aic value of the lognormal model was increased and the bacteria distributions of mg aic 1322 30 and sg aic 789 20 were more consistent with the mandelbrot model this model describes how the presence of one unit could affect the environment as a whole and how such effects could lead to changes in the environment and the introduction of new units therefore the addition of aom altered the distribution of microorganisms in drinking water and tended to follow the mandelbrot model because of the rapid growth of bacteria that could adapt to high nutrient conditions hypothetically bacteroidetes are numerous due to their capacity to build protective barriers around themselves in an organic environment which allows them to more effectively adapt to environments with high nutritional requirements was supported wang et al 2021b 3 5 correlation analysis rda was used to study correlations involving environmental factors and bacterial community structure zhang et al 2021b as shown in fig s8 the interpretation rates of rda1 and rda2 were 90 1 and 8 8 respectively there were significant differences among the control group mg and sg the control group showed the strongest association with the level of free chlorine whereas mg had the highest positive correlations with tn no3 n nh4 n and fe and sg showed the strongest correlation with no2 n moreover toc was the most important environmental factor affecting the system and sg and mg exhibited a positive correlation with toc sem was used to investigate relationship between environmental conditions and bacterial communities in the three groups zhang et al 2022c the two sets of variables were separated by the metal fe and water quality tn no3 n nh4 n no2 n tp and residual chlorine according to the sem results the bacterial communities reacted differently to various organic matters reitter et al 2021 as shown in fig 8 the organic matter had a negative effect on bacterial activity in both the mg standardized coefficient 0 520 and sg standardized coefficient 0 056 however in contrast to the control group organic matter standardized coefficient 0 088 was positively associated with bacterial activity the effect of water quality on bacteria activity exhibited a polarized tendency fig 8b and c show that water quality had a strong negative impact on bacteria activity in the sg standardized coefficient 0 407 and a positive impact on bacteria activity in the mg standardized coefficient 0 261 in addition the organic matter had an intensely positive effect on water quality and a negative impact on metal in the three groups the rda results revealed that the bacterial community structure was influenced by a range of environmental factors including residual chlorine toc tn no2 n and metal this is consistent with the research by zhang et al 2022a which indicated that the stagnation increases the risk of opportunistic pathogens similarly the sem demonstrated that water quality was strongly associated with bacterial activity in addition the rda and sem results both showed that the impact of metal on bacterial community structure changed from negative to positive after adding aom learbuch et al 2021 discovered that the pipe material had a significant impact on the bacterial community structure and the abundance of particular microorganisms in dwds moreover the organic chemicals increase the concentration of bacteria linked to fe metabolism wang et al 2021a 4 conclusions this study revealed that stagnation and aom caused a deterioration of water quality in drinking water pipes compared with 0 h the concentration of free residual chlorine in the control group mg and sg decreased by 12 15 fold 17 07 fold and 10 93 fold respectively after 120 h the addition of aom increased the carbon source metabolic activity of bacteria and the majority of the carbon sources could be utilized by mg and sg network analysis demonstrated that most bacterial communities were positively correlatedand novosphingobium sp was dominant among the three groups based on sem and rda analyses environmental factors such as residual chlorine toc and metal were significantly correlated with bacterial community structure in addition the presence of aom reversed the relationship between bacterial activity and bacterial cell count from negative to positive these findings indicate that further research is required to identify the impacts of aom on drinking water ecosystems

15452,eutrophication and algal blooms have become global issues the drinking water treatment process suffers from pollution by algal organic matter aom through cell lysis during the algal blooms nevertheless it remains unclear how aom invasion affects water quality and microbial communities in drinking water particularly in the stagnant settings in this study the addition of aom caused the residual chlorine to rapidly degrade and below the limit of 0 05 mg l while the no2 n concentration ranged from 0 11 to 3 71 mg l additionally total bacterial counts increased and subsequently decreased the results of biolog demonstrated that the aom significantly improved the utilization capacity of carbon sources and changed the preference for carbon sources full length 16s rrna gene sequencing and network modeling revealed a considerable reduction in the abundance of proteobacteria whereas that of bacteroidetes increased significantly under the influence of aom furthermore the species abundance distributions of the microcystis group and scenedesmus group was most consistent with the mandelbrot model according to redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling the bacterial community structure of the control group was most positively regulated by the free residual chlorine concentrations whereas the microcystis group and scenedesmus group were positively correlated with the total organic carbon toc concentration overall these findings provide a scientific foundation for the evolution of drinking water quality under algae bloom pollution graphical

do not have permission to share data 1 introduction reservoirs are among the most important water sources for countries and play a vital role in the safety of public drinking water zhang et al 2022c however in the context of global warming reservoirs face the challenge of eutrophication which can result in unpleasant odors algal toxins and the death of aquatic organisms gobler 2020 huang et al 2022 liu et al 2022 drinking water treatment plants dwtps are also be affected by algal blooms causing the deterioration in water quality and the invasion of algal organic matter aom such as the green soup incident at a reservoir in hubei province china janssen 2019 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 many studies have shown that the organic matter negatively impacts water quality and the microbial ecosystems shi et al 2022 wood 2016 yet the removal of organic matter using traditional processes i e coagulated sedimented and disinfected is unsatisfactory prest et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 therefore it is critical to investigate the impact of organic matter on drinking water drinking water pipe systems are susceptible to microorganisms lautenschlager et al 2010 in recent years the effects of organic matter on microorganisms have been widely studied biodegradable organic matter bom in pipes can degrade the biostability of drinking water and lead to the regeneration of pathogenic bacteria which significantly determines the growth potential of microorganisms in drinking water kasuga et al 2020 cyanobacteria can produce large amounts of organic matter and phytotoxins that affect water safety during algal blooms in reservoirs zhang et al 2014 to date many studies have shown that natural organic matter nom could be a source of a variety of drinking water issues including bacterial growth in distribution systems rantanen et al 2020 volk et al 2002 yao et al 2022 aom which mainly consists of amino acids proteinaceous materials and carbohydrates is released as a metabolic by product or a result of cell lysis during water treatment dong et al 2021 wang et al 2019 however however reports regarding the effects of aom on bacterial activity and water quality in drinking water remain rare consequently the response mechanism of microbial ecology to aom in the drinking water pipe systems requires further study drinking water quality and microbial ecology are also influenced by pipe material kelley et al 2014 plumbing age dias et al 2019 stagnant time zlatanovic et al 2017 and organic content pivokonsky et al 2015 stagnation of drinking water in pipelines is unavoidable studies concerning plumbing in buildings have shown that the cell concentration in stagnant water increases with the length of stagnation and amount of biofilm in the pipe lautenschlager et al 2010 proctor et al 2017 compared with fresh water stagnant water contributes to bacterial growth and microorganism metabolism including cell proliferation in drinking water distribution systems dwds zhang et al 2022a 2021c 2015 furthermore many studies have indicated that stagnation can increase the number of microorganisms and cause the survival patterns of bacterial communities to become more intricate chen et al 2020b zhang et al 2022a nevertheless there have been few studies surrounding the microbiological changes in stagnant water polluted by aom therefore additional research is required to determine the combined effects of stagnation and aom on the microbial ecosystems in drinking water pipes to this end the primary goal of this study was to investigate the water quality as well as the quantity activity and community structure of bacteria in the drinking water pipelines under the influence of aom and stagnation the specific objectives were 1 to inspect the water quality under the influence of aom and stagnation 2 to analyze the various characteristics of the bacteria in terms of quantity activity and community structure in the pipelines under the pollution of exogenous aom and 3 to assess the relationships between the bacterial community and essential water factors through various statistical techniques this study provides new insights into the evolution of drinking water quality and microbial biological characteristics during algal blooms thereby providing a scientific basis for drinking water safety protection 2

statistical analysis line and bar charts were drawn by origin 2019 software r software version 3 6 1 was used to create a species abundance distribution sad model wu et al 2019a to examine the connection between microbial communities redundancy analysis rda and co occurrence network analysis were performed using canoco v 4 5 and r software v 3 6 1 respectively huang et al 2019 r software v 3 6 1 was used to analyze the pearson correlation coefficient between the water quality parameters bacterial number and bacterial metabolic activity the genus level community structure of the bacteria was examined using circos software http circos ca and the correlation between environmental conditions and bacteria was evaluated using structural equation modeling sem zhang et al 2022c 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation in water quality characteristics as shown in fig 1 a compared with the control group 0 12 mg l the free chlorine concentration decreased significantly at 0 h under the influence of aom 0 06 mg l within 12 h of stagnation the free chlorine concentration in three groups had decreased to 0 02 mg l which is lower than the limit of 0 05 mg l in the hygienic standard for drinking water gb5746 2006 fig 1b shows that the concentration of total residual chlorine decreased continuously with stagnant time for the control group this decreased was from 0 27 mg l to 0 07 mg l within 48 h in addition after 48 h both the microcystis group mg and scenedesmus group sg levels were below 0 05 mg l thus the invasion of aom accelerated the decay of free chlorine drinking water quality was ensured by residual chlorine which controlled microbial reproduction and ensured water safety previous research has revealed that temperature stagnation time ph metal corrosion and organic matter all play roles in chlorine degradation for example the organic supplementation enhances the level of free residue chlorine required for biofilm management at 6 c considerably ndiongue et al 2005 furthermore chlorine interacts with other elements to generate trichloromethane thms and other disinfection by products which were harmful to human health variations in no3 n nh4 n and no2 n concentrations with stagnation time are presented in fig 2 at 0 h the no3 n concentration 4 95 mg l in mg was lower than that 5 61 mg l in sg fig 2a in contrast the concentration of nh4 n in mg was higher than that in sg fig 2c compared with that at 0 h the concentration of no2 n in mg and sg at 120 h increased by 30 8 and 31 4 times respectively fig 2b with an increase in stagnant time the concentration of no3 n in the three groups showed a continuous decrease falling by 34 30 50 00 and 66 94 respectively the concentration of nh4 n in the control group increased before 18 h and peaked at 0 42 mg l and then began to decline and stabilize after 24 h in mg the nh4 n concentration increased with stagnant time reached 0 56 mg l after 120 h and increased by 117 78 from 0 h in sg nh4 n concentration also increased with stagnant time peaked by 72 h 0 45 mg l and then started to fall nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria are widely distributed in the drinking water pipeline systems golaki et al 2022 ma et al 2022b in the early stages of stagnation ammonifiers led to the transformation of organic nitrogen in drinking water into nh4 n and reached a peak at 18 h at this time the no2 n concentration began to accumulate because nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria began to dominate in addition the no3 n concentration continued to decrease during the stagnation process which might have been due to the effects of denitrifying bacteria pressman et al 2012 zhang et al 2022b 2023 according to a previous report the chlorination could retard but not entirely prevent denitrification and the concentration of no2 n would accumulate obvious at 30 c yu et al 2009 during the stagnation of drinking water pipes certain functional microorganisms decompose proteins into ammonia nitrogen which is transformed into no3 n and no2 n by nitrifying bacteria nitrate reductase which is released during the process converted nitrate to nitrite and promotes such nitrite formation ma et al 2022a furthermore the electron acceptor competition for the carbon source of nitrate and nitrite would cause the accumulation of nitrite and the inhibition of nitrite reduction because of nitrate existence guo et al 2009 verbaendert et al 2011 the tp concentrations in the three groups showed a declining trend in fig 2d aom witha high phosphorus content is one of the most important nutrients for microorganism development and metabolism therefore a decrease in the concentration of tp might be due to microbes absorbing phosphorus jeon et al 2014 one of the main reasons for the decrease in phosphorus concentration in drinking water is the adsorption of pipe iron and minerals on phosphorus chardon et al 2022 the toc concentration decreased with stagnation time fig 2e compared with 0 h the toc concentrations of the control group mg and sg at 120 h decreased by 82 66 53 97 and 55 35 respectively aom has a complex composition with high heterogeneity including proteins lipids polysaccharides free amino acids nucleic acids algal toxins and odorants hua et al 2019 the fe concentration increased considerably with stagnant time fig 2f after 48 h the addition of aom inhibited fe release but there was no discernible change beyond72 h fe bacteria can grow at a high fe concentration which could deteriorate the chroma and produce an odor yang et al 2014 additionally the organic compounds had a stabilizing effect on fe in iron materials because organic compounds encouraged the enrichment of bacteria which were associated with fe metabolism such as bacteroides dok59 and methanosarcina wang et al 2021a the composition of organic materials in the three groups was displayed in figs s1 s3 tyrosine was present in the control group in minor amounts but it was converted to humic acid after 6 h and the peak vanished after 12 h tryptophan fulvic acid humic acid and aromatic proteins constituted a majority of the organic matter in the mg after 24 h the fulvic acid humic acid and aromatic proteins were rapidly digested wang et al 2014 3 2 diversity of biomass and bio activity fig 3 a shows the hpc modification rule for the three groups the total number of bacteria increased and then decreased over time the stagnant time in the control group peaked at 12 h the mg peaked at 18 h and the sg peaked at 24 h with 3 170 52 500 and 44 000 cfu ml respectively it is possible that after a period of stagnation organic matter and other elements in drinking water are rapidly consumed thus limiting bacterial regeneration liang et al 2021 the results of fcm are shown in fig 3b the total number of cells detected included both culturable and unculturable cells with stagnation time the total number of cells in the control group increased from 0 12 105 cells ml at 0 h to 3 05 105 cells ml at 18 h and then decreased by 48 h the total number of bacterial cells in the mg increased from 0 41 105 cells ml at 0 h to 48 39 105 cells ml at 18 h and decreased to 14 47 105 cells ml by 120 h in sg the cell number increased from 0 86 105 cells ml at 0 h to 67 27 105 cells ml at 72 h thendecreased to 1 43 105 cells ml by 120 h similar findings had been reported in earlier researches prest et al 2014 zlatanoviÄ et al 2018 the intact cell count increased initially before decreasing with stagnation time and reached its maximum value at 48 h zlatanovic et al 2017 the microbial count in bottled drinking water was also increased dramatically in the first six days after packing but slowly thereafter lesaulnier et al 2017 these phenomena may be the result of the addition of organic matter which consumes free chlorine and controls the growth of microbes in drinking water allowing them to regenerate rapidly during the initial stages of stagnation on the other hand the tendency of the concentration to increase to decrease might due to the growth of bacteria being limited by the concentration of organic matter fig 3c and 3d show that both the total atp and intracellular atp concentrations first increased and then decreased with stagnation time the total atp concentration in drinking water greatly increased owing to the presence of aom and it was greater in the mg than in the sg for both total atp and intracellular atp concentrations the intracellular atp concentrations in control group and mg peaked at 18 h which increased by 4 41 and 3 28 times compared at 0 h respectively the increase in intracellular atp content suggests that cells might transition from low nucleic acid cells to high nucleic acid cells during stagnation and bacterial cells might alter themselves in response to the external environment at a later stage of stagnation 3 3 carbon source metabolic activity analysis the biolog technique was used to analyze the carbon source metabolism ability of microorganisms wang et al 2021b as shown in fig 4 a awcd 590nm increased rapidly within 72 h of stagnation the addition of aom greatly increased the awcd 590nm signifying that it accelerated the metabolic activity kumar et al 2020 principal component analysis was performed on bacterial carbon source metabolism as shown in fig 4b there were significant differences in the characteristics of bacterial carbon source metabolism among the three groups the control group showed a negative relationship with principal component 1 whereas mg and sg showed a positive relationship with principal component 1 additionally there were variations across the groups in the microbial preferences for carbon sources fig 4c the most commonly used carbon sources in the control group were d galactose gamma lactone and methyl pyruvate mg and sg could employ most of the carbon sources while the glycogen d l a glycerol phenylethylamine and d galacturonic acid in mg were not readily utilized the utilization of methyl pyruvate d galactose gamma lactone d glucosamine itaconic acid and Î± butyric acid in sg was weak in general the control group used alcohol as a carbon sources more efficiently the addition of aom promoted the utilization of carbon sources by bacteria and the degree of utilization of different carbon sources varied interestingly the ability of bacteria to metabolize alcohols decreased after the addition of scenedesmus organic matter this could be explained by the fact that the utilization of various carbon sources by bacteria is adaptable to changes in environmental conditions the biolog is a promising technique for physiological community characterization that reveals the metabolic processes carried out by bacteria as well as their potential for use as carbon substrates gionchetta et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a as shown in fig 5 the network was used to examine the relationship between each carbon source in the 31 groups r 0 6 p 0 05 in the control group there was a negative correlation between glucose 1 phosphate phenylethylamine and the other carbon sources compared with the control group the network complexity of mg was decreased while the compactness was increased whereas d l a glycerol 2 hydroxybenzoic acid and n acetyl d glucamine were negatively correlated with other carbon sources table s1 in comparison to the control group the network of sg complexity network increased while its compactness decreased resulting in a positive connection between carbon sources wu et al 2021 3 4 bacterial community structure and composition the richness and diversity indices of the three groups are shown in table 1 the number of otus was 1164 920 and 2070 respectively the number of otus of mg were fewer than those of the control group because the metabolites of algae might inhibit the growth and metabolism of some bacteria petrovic and simonic 2015 at the same time the presence of aom might induce bacteria to produce new dominant phyla by changing water quality and thus inhibit other competing microorganisms compared with the control group the bumber of otus in sg were remarkably increased indicating that the bacterial community structure became richer under the stimulation of organic matter in scenedesmus the difference between the mg and sg due tothe different types of organic matter filippini et al 2019 the abundance of each sample species at the phylum level is shown in fig s6 it showed that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the two most prevalent phyla with the addition of aom the relative abundance of proteobacteria in drinking water decreased considerably however after adding aom the relative abundance of bacteroidetes considerably rose in general proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant during stagnation whereas the addition of aom affected the structure of the microbial community particularly that of bacteroidetes previous research has indicated that proteobacteria represent the most abundant bacteria in stagnant water 60 80 zlatanovic et al 2017 a recent study has shown that bacteroidetes are adept at disassembling complex organisms munoz et al 2020 bacteroidetes have a surrounding material space and provide a protective zone for degradation such as oligosaccharides preventing enzymes and degradation products from diffusing and vanishing thus bacteroidetes can increase its community abundance because of its ability to create a defense system in the organic environments the bacterial communities of the three groups were diverse at the genus level fig 6 a after 120 h of stagnation novosphingobium sp methyloversatilis sp sphingobium sp and ralstonia sp were dominant in the control group accounted for 41 72 14 90 6 47 and 6 14 of the total respectively under the influence of aom the abundances of novosphingobium sp methyloversatilis sp sphingobium sp and ralstonia sp were decreased in contrast the abundances of azonexus sp bosea sp flectobacillus sp and blastomonas sp was increased notably although the relative abundances of novosphingobium sp and methyloversatilis sp decreased they were still dominant in the sg and mg azonexus sp and janthinobacterium sp appeared only in the mg whereas flectobacillus sp was found only in sg in addition the general trend is similar to that shown in fig s7 previous research has indicated that the novosphingobium sp have a greater ability to degrade microcystins they also have the characteristics of complex and diverse metabolic types and strong adaptability chen et al 2020a in addition novosphingobium sp is an excellent bioreactor for aromatics pollution because of its ability to degrade aromatic compounds hashimoto et al 2010 notomista et al 2011 consequently novosphingobium sp constituted the majority of the community azonexus sp is a widespread nitrate reducing bacterium that thrives in nutrient rich and anaerobic settings chou et al 2008 wu et al 2019b previous studies have pointed out that azonexus sp is the main functional microorganism for nitrate nitrogen reduction in the presence of fe â± klueglein and kappler 2013 nordhoff et al 2017 flectobacillus sp is a common gram negative bacteria strain that increased cell size for defend against predators the growth of flectobacillus sp is promoted under the stress of viruses and heterotrophic giardia which could increase the availability of substrates simek et al 2007 bosea sp has been found to remove nitrite by heterotrophic nitrification and removes nitrite more efficiently under anoxic conditions rather than aerobic conditions xiang et al 2022 overall greater consideration should be given to the microbiological safety risk of portable water contaminated by algae bloom as this could potentially be of concern to human health relationships between microorganisms in drinking water at the genus level were investigated using network analysis fig 6b bosea sp devosia sp pelomonas sp blastomonas sp and ensifer sp had favorable correlations with one another among the eight modules that were categorized pesudomonas sp and bradyrhizobium sp comamonas sp and lacibacter sp brevundimonas sp and sphingomonas sp all exhibited negative relationships sad analysis was used to analyze the drinking water bacterial model fig 7 the lower the aic value the closer it was to the distribution model the most suitable model for microorganisms in the control group was the lognormal model aic 642 58 which expresses the community dynamics as a random zero sum process in other words the size of the community barely changed and the disappearance of units would be supplemented by other units after the addition of aom the aic value of the lognormal model was increased and the bacteria distributions of mg aic 1322 30 and sg aic 789 20 were more consistent with the mandelbrot model this model describes how the presence of one unit could affect the environment as a whole and how such effects could lead to changes in the environment and the introduction of new units therefore the addition of aom altered the distribution of microorganisms in drinking water and tended to follow the mandelbrot model because of the rapid growth of bacteria that could adapt to high nutrient conditions hypothetically bacteroidetes are numerous due to their capacity to build protective barriers around themselves in an organic environment which allows them to more effectively adapt to environments with high nutritional requirements was supported wang et al 2021b 3 5 correlation analysis rda was used to study correlations involving environmental factors and bacterial community structure zhang et al 2021b as shown in fig s8 the interpretation rates of rda1 and rda2 were 90 1 and 8 8 respectively there were significant differences among the control group mg and sg the control group showed the strongest association with the level of free chlorine whereas mg had the highest positive correlations with tn no3 n nh4 n and fe and sg showed the strongest correlation with no2 n moreover toc was the most important environmental factor affecting the system and sg and mg exhibited a positive correlation with toc sem was used to investigate relationship between environmental conditions and bacterial communities in the three groups zhang et al 2022c the two sets of variables were separated by the metal fe and water quality tn no3 n nh4 n no2 n tp and residual chlorine according to the sem results the bacterial communities reacted differently to various organic matters reitter et al 2021 as shown in fig 8 the organic matter had a negative effect on bacterial activity in both the mg standardized coefficient 0 520 and sg standardized coefficient 0 056 however in contrast to the control group organic matter standardized coefficient 0 088 was positively associated with bacterial activity the effect of water quality on bacteria activity exhibited a polarized tendency fig 8b and c show that water quality had a strong negative impact on bacteria activity in the sg standardized coefficient 0 407 and a positive impact on bacteria activity in the mg standardized coefficient 0 261 in addition the organic matter had an intensely positive effect on water quality and a negative impact on metal in the three groups the rda results revealed that the bacterial community structure was influenced by a range of environmental factors including residual chlorine toc tn no2 n and metal this is consistent with the research by zhang et al 2022a which indicated that the stagnation increases the risk of opportunistic pathogens similarly the sem demonstrated that water quality was strongly associated with bacterial activity in addition the rda and sem results both showed that the impact of metal on bacterial community structure changed from negative to positive after adding aom learbuch et al 2021 discovered that the pipe material had a significant impact on the bacterial community structure and the abundance of particular microorganisms in dwds moreover the organic chemicals increase the concentration of bacteria linked to fe metabolism wang et al 2021a 4 conclusions this study revealed that stagnation and aom caused a deterioration of water quality in drinking water pipes compared with 0 h the concentration of free residual chlorine in the control group mg and sg decreased by 12 15 fold 17 07 fold and 10 93 fold respectively after 120 h the addition of aom increased the carbon source metabolic activity of bacteria and the majority of the carbon sources could be utilized by mg and sg network analysis demonstrated that most bacterial communities were positively correlatedand novosphingobium sp was dominant among the three groups based on sem and rda analyses environmental factors such as residual chlorine toc and metal were significantly correlated with bacterial community structure in addition the presence of aom reversed the relationship between bacterial activity and bacterial cell count from negative to positive these findings indicate that further research is required to identify the impacts of aom on drinking water ecosystems

15453,electron rich iron sites are the main sites for iron based catalysts to activate persulfate ps to generate reactive species while blocked fe2 fe3 cycling usually reduces the catalytic performance of iron based materials and hinders the generation of reactive species in the reaction to solve the bottleneck we synthesized an iron carbon nanocomposite catalyst loaded with moo2 fe mo cns the promotion of moo2 on the fe2 fe3 cycle in the system allowed fe mo cns to exhibit excellent catalytic performance and environmental adaptability the degradation rate of bisphenol s bps by the fe mo cns ps system was significantly increased to 0 080 min 1 compared with the iron carbon based catalyst persulfate system and the degradation efficiency of bps was maintained at around 85 after four cycles density functional theory dft calculations showed that the introduction of moo2 reduced the reaction energy barrier of persulfate activated by catalysts to produce reactive species especially promoted the production of more high valent iron fe iv fe iv and reactive oxygen species so4 oh o2 and 1o2 worked together on the efficient degradation of bps in addition the test of an automatic circulating degradation plant had proved that fe mo cns had a good practical application prospect bps was mainly degraded by ring cleavage and o s o bond cleavage and the toxicity of bps and its intermediates were also evaluated this work clarifies the mechanism of improving the catalytic performance of heterogeneous iron based catalysts by moo2 in sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops providing a new idea for solving the blockage of fe2 fe3 cycle in sr aops graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords moo2 fe mo cns persulfate fe iv bps degradation 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have promising application in the treatment of refractory pollutants in the aqueous environment due to the higher redox potential 2 6 3 1 v and longer half life of so4 than traditional hydroxyl radical oh wacÅawek et al 2017 so4 is commonly produced by activating persulfate ps using external energy heat ultrasound uv liu et al 2020c or catalysts iron based catalysts are abundant cheap and efficient activators lyu et al 2020 compared with homogeneous fe2 heterogeneous fe based catalysts have the advantages of higher catalytic performance better environmental adaptability and reusability bu et al 2017 however heterogeneous iron based catalysts are prone to aggregation of active iron sites and active radicals such as so4 and oh are easily quenched by coexisting anions and natural organic matter nom both of significantly reduces the efficiency of pollutant treatment zheng et al 2019 iron carbon based materials contain a carbon network that not only disperses the iron sufficiently to prevent the aggregation of active sites but also accelerates the electron transfer between metal sites and persulfate promoting the generation of more reactive oxygen species ros and thus improving the adaptability of the catalysts to the actual environment gao et al 2021 he et al 2022 used an fe nitrogen doped carbon nanocomposite as a catalyst to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the effective degradation of sulfamethoxazole in water they demonstrated that the carbon network structure obtained by high temperature carbonization could adequately disperse the fe sites and promote the production of ros however after fe2 with high persulfate activation performance is oxidized to fe3 it is difficult to spontaneously complete the fe2 fe3 cycle due to the low reactivity between fe3 and persulfate which hinders the continued application of fe or fe carbon based catalysts in sr aops systems yi et al 2020 it is unwise to increase the amount of catalysts in order to improve the efficiency of pollutant treatment as this does not fundamentally solve the problem of the blocked reaction cycle but rather increases costs and produces more iron containing sludge therefore the addition of co catalysts to promote fe2 fe3 cycling in the reaction has attracted attention several studies have shown that metal sulfides mos2 ws2 dong et al 2018 xing et al 2018 and soluble reductants epigallocatechingallate and hydroxylamine bu et al 2017 hou et al 2017 can enhance the conversion of fe3 to fe2 in a fenton like system redox cycling of mo mo4 mo6 and w w4 w6 in mos2 and ws2 with fe2 fe3 can regenerate the active fe species but the metal sulfide may produce harmful h2s gas moreover the addition of a soluble reducing agent may cause secondary contamination in the reaction system molybdenum dioxide moo2 can be used as an alternative to mos2 due to its low cost and multivalent state shen et al introduced moo2 as a co catalyst in the fenton system to promote fe3 fe2 cycling and achieved efficient degradation of lissamine rhodamine b and rapid reduction of cr vi shen et al 2019 however most of the current research has focused on the role of moo2 in promoting iron cycling in homogeneous systems moo2 has been shown to improve the electronic conductivity of a metal carbon based electrochemical materials xia et al 2016 taken together these results imply that iron molybdenum carbon based materials could efficiently activate persulfate and promote fe2 fe3 cycling in sr aops the faster fe2 fe3 cycle would ensure that there are sufficient reactive species in the reaction and the higher electronic conductivity of catalysts is conducive to the electron transfer between catalysts persulfate and organics so as to promote the treatment of pollutants in the degradation system in addition to the traditional free radical and non free radical oxidants the role of fe iv is gaining interest in the research of the application of iron based catalysts in advanced oxidation systems zong et al 2021 xu et al prepared fes activated pms for the degradation of chloramphenicol and found a synergistic catalytic effect of fe iv as well but its contribution was less than that of so4 due to its low redox potential and weak competition ability xu and sheng 2021 chen et al found that the activation of persulfate by pre magnetized fe0 could greatly facilitate the degradation of p arsanilic acid due to the production of fe iv in the process chen et al 2021 therefore the reactive species produced in heterogeneous sr aops systems containing moo2 are worth investigating herein iron carbon based catalysts fe mo cns doped with a large number of active mo sites were synthesized by loading moo2 on fe cns material formed by carbonization of nh2 mil 101 fe the properties and mechanisms of persulfate activation by fe mo cns were systematically investigated as a common substitute for bisphenol a bps is not only more stable in the water environment but also has a longer toxic effect on humans and animals than bpa lu et al 2019 therefore bps was selected as the target pollutant to study the degradation performance of the as prepared catalysts the main objectives of this study were to 1 identify the main types of reactive species in the fe mo cns ps system 2 elucidate the role and mechanism of moo2 in promoting fe2 fe3 cycling in the reaction system 3 clarify the resistance of the fe mo cns ps system to environmental influences and the stability of fe mo cns recovery and 4 explore the potential of fe mo cns materials for practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents and catalysts preparation all chemicals and solvents used in the experiment can be found in text s1 in the supporting information and the preparation methods of different catalysts are provided in text s2 s4 2 2 characterization and bps degradation process all characterization used in the experiment and the bps degradation process can be found in text s5 and text s6 in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the preparation process of fe mo cns and fe cns is shown in fig 1 a the xrd images show the composition of fe mo cns and fe cns materials fig 1 b specifically a relatively high diffraction peak at 26 5 indicated that the fe mo cns contain more graphitized carbon the diffraction peaks at 37 8 42 9 45 0 45 9 58 0 and 83 0 in fe cns are attributed to the 210 211 031 112 301 and 332 crystalline planes of fe3c jcpds 85 1317 liu et al 2020c and similar diffraction peaks of fe3c 23 7 37 8 48 6 and 61 3 also exist in fe mo cns fig 1b a series of characteristic peaks appear at 37 0 53 3 53 7 60 4 66 8 and 79 0 corresponding to the 111 211 222 131 231 and 040 crystalline planes of moo2 jcpds 76 1807 wei et al 2020 in fe mo cns respectively moreover as the mo fe ratio increases the corresponding diffraction peaks of moo2 in the catalysts become progressively more pronounced fig s1a ft ir spectra of the fe mo cns and fe cns show the characteristic peaks at 560 cm 1 and 1450 1650 cm 1 corresponding to the fe o vibration and o c o stretching respectively of the two catalysts fig s1b in particular fe mo cns has a stronger signal value than fe cns at 3470 cm 1 indicating that fe mo cns contains more vc n group combined with xrd images fig s1a fe mo cns contained more nitrogen species which might be due to the addition of more ammonium molybdate during the synthesis process as shown in figs s2a and s2b fe cns presented stacked nanosheet structure both on the whole and inside and contained irregular channels inside the morphology of fe mo cns showed more regular aggregates fig 1c which might be due to the aggregation of a layer of moo2 particles on the surface of the carbon structure and the wrapping effect of moo2 allowed the catalyst to possess a more regular shape in addition the wrapping effect of moo2 did not affect the formation of irregular channels inside fe mo cns fig s3 to further understand the internal structure of the catalysts tem images of fe mo cns and fe cns at different magnifications were provided figs 1d and s2c d showing the dispersed metal nanoparticles coated with the carbon network structure in both catalysts the tem mapping images further confirmed that fe nanoparticles were wrapped by carbon network structure in fe cns while fe and mo were roughly uniformly dispersed in the same location in fe mo cns suggesting that the carbon shell encasing the fe nanoparticles was accompanied by a moo2 layer in fe mo cns in addition the carbon shell of fe mo cns was composed of multi layer nanosheets with a crystal spacing of 0 349 nm which was very close to that of graphite 0 35 nm the three dimensional network structure of the carbon and moo2 layers not only provided dual protection for the fe3c nanoparticles but also might improve the electron conduction ability of the catalyst xia et al 2016 in addition xps analysis was used to further explore the chemical composition of the catalysts as shown in fig s4 a compared with fe cns the peak position of fe species in fe mo cns did not change significantly it can be found that the peaks at 709 39 and 722 79 ev corresponds to fe2 while the peaks at 712 66 and 726 70 ev were attributed to fe3 in particular fe mo cns have large fe n peaks at 711 15 and 724 68 ev which is attributed to the incorporation of nitrogen species into the fe mo cns by ammonium molybdate sun et al 2021 and different nitrogen species were observed in fe mo cns including pyridnic n 397 44 ev pyrrolic n 398 47 ev graphitic n 399 79 ev and mo n bonds 396 11 ev li et al 2019 fig s4b the mo 3d spectra showed that fe mo cns mainly contained two mo species mo iv 232 88 and 229 46 ev and mo vi 232 45 and 235 79 ev fig s4c liu et al 2020b wei et al 2020 3 2 effect of moo2 on catalytic performance of catalysts the effect of moo2 on the catalytic properties was investigated using catalysts with different fe mo ratios to activate persulfate for the degradation of bps fig 2 a the results showed that the catalytic performance of fexmoy cns did not improve compared to fe cns when the mo content was low figs s5 and s6 and the degradation rate of bps in the fe2 5mo1 cns ps system decreased to 0 032 min 1 instead fig 2b this might be due to the fact that small amounts of moo2 did not contribute sufficiently to the fe2 fe3 cycling with a further increase in moo2 content the catalytic performance of fe mo cns gradually improved and the degradation rate of bps in the fe mo cns ps system 0 058 min 1 was about 1 7 times higher than that of the fe cns ps system 0 035 min 1 this indicated that the introduction of an appropriate amount of moo2 improved the ability of nitrogen doped iron carbon catalysts to activate ps thus promoting the treatment of bps in the reaction system in addition bps was not degraded when the catalyst was absent suggesting that it was difficult for persulfate alone to produce reactive radicals the cns obtained after the removal of fe and mo from the fe mo cns are also incapable of activating ps figs 2c and s7b furthermore the bps was not degraded in the mo cns ps system indicating that moo2 was not the active site for the activation of persulfate compared to the other systems the highest bps degradation rate and efficiency of 0 058 min 1 and 100 respectively were achieved in the fe mo cns ps system within 70 min fig 2d indicating that the fe sites may be the main active sites for the activation of ps and the introduction of moo2 enhanced the ability of the original fe based catalysts to activate ps and degrade the contaminants in addition the basic conditions of the fe mo cns ps system were determined by the influence of catalyst dosage and persulfate concentration fig s8 3 3 role of moo2 in the production of reactive species to investigate the reactive species in the fe mo cns ps and fe cns ps systems methanol meoh tert butanol tba p benzoquinone p bq and l histidine were chosen as the trapping agents for so4 oh o2 and 1o2 respectively ding et al 2021 when 2 mm l histidine was added to the fe mo cns ps system the degradation efficiency of bps dropped significantly to 7 4 and the degradation rate slowed down to 0 001 min 1 figs 3 a and s9d similarly after the introduction of meoh 500 mm tba 500 mm and p bq 2mm into the system the degradation efficiency of bps was inhibited to 10 6 30 7 and 41 7 respectively and with the increase of the concentration of the four capture agents the degree of inhibition of bps degradation gradually increased figs 3b 3d and s9 indicating that the four ros cooperate to degrade bps and the free radical capture experiments also showed that so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were involved in the bps degradation process in the fe cns ps system fig s10 some o2 in sr aops may be generated from the dissolved oxygen in the reaction when the dissolved oxygen was removed by ar fig s11 the degradation rate of bps in the fe mo cns ps system decreased slightly from 0 084 min 1 to 0 076 min 1 but it could still be completely decomposed within 70 min fig s12a in the fe cns ps system bps degradation was significantly inhibited which indicates that dissolved oxygen is involved in the formation of o2 fig s12b therefore moo2 accelerates the fe2 fe3 cycle in the fe mo cns ps system leading to the rapid formation of ros in the reaction especially the generation of o2 which hardly requires the participation of dissolved oxygen the in situ electron paramagnetic resonance epr was adopted to inspect the radicals generation and evolution during bps degradation 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was selected as the capture agent for so4 oh and o2 and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperi done temp was used for 1o2 ali et al 2021 qin et al 2021 no radicals were detected when only persulfate was present fig 3e however significant characteristic signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were observed in the fe mo cns ps system indicating that the efficient activation of ps by fe mo cns rapidly generated so4 and oh in addition 1o2 and o2 signals were detected in the fe mo cns ps system fig 3f without moo2 in the fe cns ps system the corresponding signals of active radicals so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were also detected fig s13 to further distinguish the relative contributions of free and non free radical oxidation pathways to bps degradation the competitive kinetics experiments were performed using a mixture system of nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba p benzoquinone p bq furfuryl alcohol ffa and bps figs s14 and s15 based on the reported studies xie et al 2022 and experimentally obtained second order rate constants between bps and ros fig s16 and tables s2 and s3 the steady state concentrations of the four ros species were calculated as shown in fig 3g the steady state concentrations of ros in the fe mo cns ps system were 0 5 10 12 m for oh 1 2 10 11 m for so4 3 1 10 12 m for o2 and 4 3 10 10 m for 1o2 respectively all higher than those in the fe cns ps system 0 3 10 12 m for oh 4 0 10 12 m for so4 0 4 10 12 m for o2 and 4 7 10 11 m for 1o2 therefore the relative contribution of so4 oh and 1o2 in the fe mo cns ps system were 82 5 1 6 and 2 3 respectively fig s16e and table s4 compared with the fe cns ps system 2 0 for oh 61 1 for so4 and 0 56 for 1o2 the increased contribution of so4 and 1o2 in the fe mo cns ps system suggested that the introduction of moo2 promoted the production of so4 and 1o2 in the reaction thus facilitating the degradation of bps in both systems the free radical oxidation pathways played a dominant role in the degradation of bps than the non radical pathway recent studies suggest that a new active substance fe iv may be involved in some homogeneous fe2 ps systems which could be verified by a specific rapid reaction with pmso to produce pmso2 chen et al 2021 li et al 2021 yan et al 2021 therefore the contribution of fe iv to the degradation of bps in our system was investigated by measuring the concentrations of pmso and pmso2 in both catalytic systems after 70 min of reaction the concentration of pmso decreased significantly from 1 mm to 0 02 mm and a large amount of pmso2 was produced from 0 mm to 0 82 mm fig 4 a indicating that a significant amount of fe iv was generated in the fe mo cns ps system however in the fe cns system the concentration of pmso decreased slightly from 1 mm to 0 95 mm and trace amounts of pmso2 were generated indicating no significant fe iv production in the absence of moo2 fig 4b moo2 loaded on the catalysts may promote fe2 fe3 cycling thus increasing the production of fe2 in the degradation system and simultaneously generating fe iv the conversion rate Î· pmso2 from pmso to pmso2 in the reaction could be used to investigate the contribution of fe iv to the degradation of the pollutants the Î· pmso2 reached 93 8 in the fe mo cns ps system fig s17a which might be due to the reaction between some pmso and ros affecting the production rate of pmso2 after adding bps to the system Î· pmso2 decreased to 83 7 in the fe mo cns ps bps system indicating that about 11 fe iv was actively involved in the degradation of bps in addition pmso was used as the trapping agent to further confirm the beneficial role of fe iv in the catalysts ps bps systems the degradation efficiency of bps in the fe mo cns ps system was inhibited to 67 2 and the degradation rate decreased from 0 080 min 1 to 0 014 min 1 fig 4c however since only a small amount of fe iv was present in the fe cns ps system the degradation efficiency of bps was minimally inhibited by pmso and was only reduced by 10 fig 4d these results again suggest that fe iv does play an important role in the degradation of bps in order to determine the effect of different catalyst structures and composition on fe iv formation homogeneous fe2 ps and fe2 moo2 ps systems were selected to investigate the effect of moo2 on fe iv production as shown in fig s17 the presence of moo2 in fe2 moo2 ps system significantly promoted the production of fe iv compared to fe2 ps system however the production of pmso2 0 72 mm and Î· pmso2 71 74 were less than that of the fe mo cns ps system which may be due to the carbon nitrogen network in the heterogeneous materials facilitating the electron transfer during the reaction thus promoting the production of fe iv 3 4 exploration of ps activation mechanism in the fe mo cns ps system the activation of ps by iron carbon based catalysts is often accompanied by metal redox reaction and the generation of reactive oxygen species the most critical first step is that electron rich fe sites provides electrons to s2o8 2 and generate so4 eqs 1 and 2 and the fe2 fe3 cycle becomes the key that limits the generation of ros therefore xps analysis was used to study the chemical properties of the fe mo cns and fe cns before and after the reaction to clarify the effect of moo2 on the persulfate activation mechanism fig 5 a and 5b the fe2 fe3 ratio of fe mo cns increased from 0 658 to 0 664 after the reaction table s5 while the fe2 fe3 ratio of fe cns decreased from 0 811 to 0 477 after the reaction table s6 indicating that the fe2 fe3 cycle in the fe cns ps system was greatly inhibited to further verify that moo2 promoted fe2 fe3 cycling in the reaction fe3 was introduced into the fe mo cns ps system and it was found that the degradation rate of bps increased from 0 080 min 1 to 0 194 min 1 when fe3 concentration increased to 30 mg l 1 however the homogeneous fe3 ps system could hardly degrade bps and the degradation rate of bps was only 0 0008 min 1 when fe3 concentration was 30 mg l 1 which proved the high efficiency of fe2 fe3 cycling efficiency in fe mo cns ps system fig s18 in fe mo cns mo4 in moo2 reacted with fe3 to generate fe2 and mo6 which not only promoted the fe2 fe3 cycle but also facilitated the production of ros and fe iv during the reaction eqs 3 and 4 dong et al 2021 however the proportion of mo4 mo6 in fe mo cns increased from 0 299 to 0 656 table s7 which may be caused by the reaction of mo6 with o2 the increase of mo4 content was also conducive to further promoting the fe2 fe3 cycle and mo4 mo6 in the reaction moreover the resulting so4 could react with h2o to produce oh eq 5 o2 was produced by a two step reaction of s2o8 2 with h2o eqs 6 and 7 while o2 contributed to the production of 1o2 through reaction with h2o or mo6 eqs 8 and 9 yi et al 2019 finally bps was efficiently degraded by free radicals and non radical species in the fe mo cns ps system fig 5c 1 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 s o 4 s o 4 2 2 f e 3 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 s 2 o 8 3 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2

6 1 o 2 m o 4 3 5 density functional theory density functional theory dft was used to analyze the influence of moo2 on the production of reactive oxygen species ros and fe iv in the iron carbon based catalysts ps system the optimized structure of the catalysts for the adsorption of s2o8 2 as well as the optimized structures of intermediates transition states and products of reactive species are shown in figs 6 a and s19 the breaking of the o o bond is an important step in the activation of ps to produce active species especially so4 duan et al 2021a as shown in fig 6 b and 6 c the energy barrier required to produce so4 was the lowest compared to the other three ros oh o2 and 1o2 which emphasized that the generation of so4 is a key step in the activation of ps and also suggested that ps was readily activated in the fe mo cns ps and fe cns ps systems in the fe mo cns ps system after s2o8 2 is adsorbed on the catalyst surface the bond length of o108 o105 l o108 o105 increases and the s o bonds on both sides are stretched which may be caused by bonding between s and mo in the process of further activation the bond angles between s107 o105 o108 and s106 o108 o105 are opened the l o108 o105 further lengthens the s mo bond is broken and the s fe bond is also shortened which prepares for the release of one so4 fig s20a after the release of a so4 the s fe bond lengthens which creates the conditions for the continued production of so4 however in the fe cns ps system although the generation of so4 is accompanied by an increase in the o o bond length l o99 o96 the s fe bond grows and then shortens during the reaction which is not conducive to the continued production of so4 fig s21a in addition the fe mo cns ps system has a lower energy barrier for so4 compared to the fe cns ps system which again demonstrates that the introduction of moo2 facilitates the continuous production of so4 by ps activation fig 6b and 6c the generation of s2o8 is also an essential first step in the generation of o2 and 1o2 according to eqs 6 and 7 s2o8 could react with h2o in solution to produce ho2 which reacts with s2o8 2 to generate so4 and o2 therefore according to the key transition state analysis of o2 and 1o2 generation in the fe mo cns ps system o2 and 1o2 were formed initially as the l o108 o105 grew and the bond angle between s107 o105 o108 increased which might be caused by the rupture of a s o bond in s2o8 2 fig s20c and s20d when a steady state o2 was formed the l o108 o105 shortened and the bond angles between mo97 s106 o108 and fe50 s107 o105 increased indicating that the remainder of s2o8 2 gradually stablizes while the l o109 o111 of o2 remains unchanged fig s20c this suggested that the presence of moo2 promoted the electronic conductivity of the catalyst leaving o2 in a stable state when generated in addition the energy barrier value formed by 1o2 is higher than that of o2 15 75 kcal mol 1 17 72 kcal mol 1 this might be due to the fact that 1o2 is formed by the reaction of o2 with h2o which requires further absorption of energy in the reaction to complete the stable formation of 1o2 in the fe cns ps system although the formation process of o2 and 1o2 was similar to that of the fe mo cns ps system figs s19 and s21 the energy barrier values were higher 15 75 kcal mol 1 22 51 kcal mol 1 for o2 and 17 72 kcal mol 1 25 34 kcal mol 1 for 1o2 fig 6 moreover the o99 o96 bond for the formation of o2 became longer during the reaction in the fe cns ps system which indicated that the final o2 might be in an unstable state however in both fe mo cns ps and fe cns ps systems the energy barrier values required for the formation of oh were the highest which might be caused by the complexity of the generation of oh that is so4 were first generated in the reaction and then reacted with h2o to generate oh the energy barrier formation process of oh also indicated that there was a free o atom in the intermediate state at the highest energy barrier value fig 6a the free o atom combined with an h atom to form oh which might be provided by a h2o molecule a similar process of oh generation occurred in the fe cns ps system but the energy barrier value 31 98 kcal mol 1 was higher than that in the fe mo cns ps system 21 98 kcal mol 1 fig 6b and 6c in addition to the unchanged l o99 o96 in the fe cns fig s21b these indicated that the introduction of moo2 accelerated the shortening of o o bond thus promoting the production of oh therefore the introduction of moo2 makes the formation of ros in the reaction more convenient the influence of moo2 on fe iv generation in the reaction system was further revealed by dft calculations fig 6d when ps is activated by fe ii the reactant fe ii h2o 5 s2o8 int 1 undergoes o o bond dissociation to form fe iii h2o 5 s2o8 int 2 through the transition state ts 1 c with an energy barrier of 7 214 kcal mol 1 then fe iv h2o 5 s2o8 2 products is obtained by an endothermic process 11 266 kcal mol 1 with the total energy barrier of 8 065 kcal mol 1 for the whole reaction process in the fe ii ps moo2 system the energy barrier for the formation of fe iii h2o 5 s2o8 moo2 int 2 from the reactant fe ii h2o 5 s2o8 moo2 int 1 via the transition state ts 1 c is 3 965 kcal mol 1 in addition fe iv h2o 5 s2o8 moo2 2 products is further generated via an endothermic step 9 229 kcal mol 1 and the total energy barrier for fe iv generation is 3 965 kcal mol 1 therefore it has been thermodynamically demonstrated that the introduction of moo2 favors the formation of fe iv and thus greatly facilitated the activation of ps 3 6 improved electrochemical properties of catalysts with moo2 to better reveal the advantages of the catalytic performance of fe mo cns electrochemical analysis of the catalysts was performed duan et al 2021b wang et al 2022 as shown in fig s22 a when ps 3 mm and bps 5 mg l 1 was added to the test system the current intensity was stronger for fe mo cns than for fe cns in the i t curve indicating a stronger electron transfer between fe mo cns bps and ps the cv and lsv curves showed that fe mo cns exhibited a stronger current density than fe cns fig s22b and s22c suggesting that moo2 enhanced the electron transport capacity of fe mo cns the electrochemical properties of fe mo cns showed that the introduction of moo2 improved the electron conductivity of the catalysts and promoted the activation of ps 3 7 enhanced resistance of moo2 containing catalysts to the effects of different environmental conditions the effect of different temperatures on bps degradation were studied figs s23 and s24 as the temperature increases 25 c 40 c the degradation rates of bps increased from 0 080 min 1 to 0 129 min 1 in the fe mo cns ps system especially when the temperature reached 40 c bps was completely degraded within 10 min figs s23a and s24a the activation energy ea kj mol of the fe mo cns ps system calculated from the arrhenius equation was 23 66 kj mol which was lower than that of the fe cns ps system 31 31 kj mol indicating better activation performance of fe mo cns fig s25 due to the crucial role of ph in ps decomposition the degradation of bps in terms of ph was determined it was observed that the fe mo cns ps system could effectively degrade bps over a wide ph range 3 0 9 0 fig s23c whereas the fe cns ps system inhibited the degradation of bps at all ph conditions except ph 7 6 fig s23d indicating the better resistance to ph fluctuations of fe mo cns the inorganic anions and natural organic matter nom in actual water can quench free radicals in the reaction system and further affect the degradation of pollutants ji et al 2021 therefore the ability of the fe mo cns ps system to resist interference from the coexisting anions cl so4 2 and hco3 and nom homic acid ha was investigated figs s26 and s27 the effect of cl on the degradation of bps was not significant and the catalytic degradation rate of bps could achieve 0 075 min 1 even at high cl concentrations as the so4 2 concentration increased the degradation efficiency of bps remained high despite the rate of degradation was somewhat inhibited and fluctuations in so4 2 concentration had little effect on the degradation rate of contaminants the inhibition of bps degradation by hco3 was due to the fact that hco3 not only increases the ph of the reaction but also reacts with so4 and oh to produce hco3 and co3 which have lower oxidation properties although so4 2 and hco3 had some inhibitory effect on the degradation of bps in the fe mo cns ps it was much weaker than that in the fe cns ps fig s28 furthermore in the presence of ha bps degraded approximately 95 in fe mo cns ps within 70 min despite a decrease in k from 0 080 to 0 043 min 1 as the ha concentration increased to 10 mg l 1 fig s26d and s27d however at the same high ha concentration the degradation efficiency of bps in fe cns ps decreased from 93 4 to 50 1 and the degradation rate was greatly suppressed from 0 036 to 0 010 min 1 figs s28d and s29d due to the synergistic effect of fe iv in the fe mo cns ps bps system it is also important to investigate the effects of inorganic anions and nom on the fe iv production the presence of cl so4 2 hco3 and ha reduced the Î· pmso2 in the fe2 ps moo2 system from 71 7 to 54 1 70 3 69 3 and 70 2 respectively fig s30 in contrast Î· pmso2 in the fe mo cns ps system only decreased from 93 8 to 85 9 88 6 61 1 and 91 7 under the influence of the same concentration of anions and ha fig s31 indicating that the heterogeneous fe mo cns ps system not only increased the yield of fe iv but also improved the environmental interference resistance of fe iv generation in conclusion the fe mo cns ps system was more resistant to the effects of the external environment 3 8 moo2 improved the reusability of the catalysts to investigate the reusability of the catalysts cycling experiments were carried out for the fe mo cns ps and fe cns ps system respectively in the fe mo cns ps system the degradation efficiency of bps could be maintained above 85 after four cycles despite a slight decrease fig 7 a whereas in fe cns ps the degradation efficiency dropped dramatically to 23 0 after three cycles fig 7b the bps and its products absorbed on the surface of the used catalyst may be one of the reasons for the reduced performance of the catalysts after several uses however compared to fe cns fe mo cns possessed higher cycling stability and were more suitable for long term treatment of environmental pollutants this is mainly due to the fact that the moo2 in fe mo cns promoted fe2 fe3 cycling which largely solved the problem of reduced activation of ps due to the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 making fe mo cns more durable and the fundamental reason for the dramatic decrease in the catalytic performance of fe cns was the blocked fe2 fe3 cycling moreover xrd analysis showed that the basic crystal structure of the fe mo cns did not change significantly which also indicated the stability of the fe mo cns in the reaction fig s32 to realize practical application of the fe mo cns ps system we designed a pollutant degradation plant that operated automatically at laboratory conditions and the flow chart was shown in fig 7 c the whole degradation equipment included the power equipment two peristaltic pumps the degradation tank a solution bottle and a reaction column fig s33 under the dynamic action of two peristaltic pumps a mixture 1 l of bps 5 mg l 1 and ps 3 mm flowed through the reaction column filled with several high density melamine sponges containing 15 mg fe mo cns powder the entire flow system maintained stable operation at room temperature as shown in fig 7 d the degradation efficiency of bps was consistently above 95 after four flow experiments each running continuously for 120 min this phenomenon further confirmed the excellent stability and persistence of fe mo cns due to the accelerated cyclic conversion of fe2 fe3 by moo2 furthermore no catalysts were found to fall off the sponge during the experiment indicating the practical use of the catalyst sponge module moreover different kinds of organic pollutants including bisphenol a bpa bisphenol f bpf carbamazepine cbz norfloxacin nfx clothianidin cad and rhodamine b rhb have good degradation efficiency in the fe mo cns ps system fig s34 these attempts provided a new choice for the engineering application of the catalysts in sr aops 3 9 bps degradation pathway and toxicity prediction of intermediates in order to explore the degradation mechanism of bps dft was used to predict the vulnerable positions of bps molecules fig 8 and table s8 according to the calculated fukui index c1 c5 c12 c14 o22 o24 o26 and o27 in bps were all active sites which were able to be attacked by free radical the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals homo and lumo of bps showed that the electron density was mainly concentrated in the phenyl ring o26 and o27 the hplc ms analysis was used to further investigate the intermediates of bps degradation figs 8d and s35 the sulfonated product s1 m z 344 80 underwent cyclic cleavage to produce s2 m z 192 90 in the reaction but no subsequent degradation reaction was found for s2 and carboxylated product s15 m z 293 00 therefore o s o bond breakage and ring cleavage are the main degradation paths of bps in the fe mo cns ps system the c3 and c16 sites in bps molecules have high f value and are susceptible attack by radicals such as so4 after removing phenolic groups the hydroxylated product s3 m z 173 00 was generated on the one hand s7 m z 180 90 was produced by addition reaction and s8 m z 152 75 and s9 m z 221 94 were further formed by c c bond breaking on the other hand the o s o bond were attacked to form s4 m z 162 88 s5 m z 267 43 and s6 m z 156 92 due to the high activity of o26 and o27 the o s o bond could also be directly broken to form s16 m z 234 83 and s17 m z 216 97 in the degradation path ii and further cleaved to form s4 in the degradation process iii s11 m z 236 84 could be formed by self coupling reaction c12 o22 and c5 o24 after oxygen atom transfer reaction zong et al 2020 fe iv could further attack s11 to form s12 m z 251 00 and s12 forms s13 m z 270 84 and s14 m z 112 83 through ring cleavage the formation of s12 further proved that fe iv was involved in the reaction but the reactivity of fe iv toward organic pollutants was usually weaker than that of free radicals zong et al 2021 so paths i and ii were the main degradation paths of bps finally all products were mineralized to co2 and h2o in the fe mo cns ps system four representative indexes including acute toxicity developmental toxicity bioaccumulation factors and mutagenicity were selected to evaluate the environmental friendliness of bps degradation in the fe mo cns ps system by the quantitative structural activity relationship qsar prediction as shown in fig s36 and table s9 the acute toxicity lc50 of bps was about 17 21 mg l for fathead minnow which is a toxic substance most of the degradation products were less toxic compared to bps although a few intermediates s13 s16 and s17 showed a slight increase in toxicity but these intermediates were transient and their final products s2 s6 and s8 were harmless this indicated that the higher the oxidation degree of the intermediates the less acute toxicity the changes of developmental toxicity and bioaccumulation factors were similar to those of acute toxicity except for a few intermediates the developmental toxicity and bioaccumulation factors of all the products were decreased which may be due to the reduced lipophilicity of the products the mutagenicity index showed that although the toxicity of most intermediates increased the mutagenicity was almost all negative therefore after toxicity prediction and evaluation the fe mo cns ps system could effectively reduce the potential risk of bps in the ecosystem 4 conclusions in this paper fe mo cns was synthesized by loading moo2 on the fe cns through a simple two step method dft calculation combined with experiments showed that the fe mo cns had a higher activation performance for ps than fe cns and the fe mo cns ps system was more likely to produce ros due to the fe2 fe3 cycle in the reaction facilitated by moo2 epr analyses and quenching experiments proved that reactive oxygen species so4 oh o2 and 1o2 and fe iv worked together on the degradation of bps in the fe mo cns ps system especially after moo2 was introduced into the catalyst more fe iv was produced in the fe mo cns ps system fe mo cns had stronger environmental adaptability and higher cycling stability than fe cns in addition fe mo cns showed good prospects for engineering application with the degradation rate of bps in fe mo cns ps reaching about 95 within 8 h in the experimental reactor future research should focus on further improving the activation performance of catalysts and optimizing the industrial application of powder catalysts ring cleavage and o s o bond cleavage were the main degradation methods of bps and the toxicity of bps was reduced after degradation by the fe mo cns ps system with the development of the sr aops this study provides a new choice for overcoming the obstacles of iron carbon materials in practical

15453,electron rich iron sites are the main sites for iron based catalysts to activate persulfate ps to generate reactive species while blocked fe2 fe3 cycling usually reduces the catalytic performance of iron based materials and hinders the generation of reactive species in the reaction to solve the bottleneck we synthesized an iron carbon nanocomposite catalyst loaded with moo2 fe mo cns the promotion of moo2 on the fe2 fe3 cycle in the system allowed fe mo cns to exhibit excellent catalytic performance and environmental adaptability the degradation rate of bisphenol s bps by the fe mo cns ps system was significantly increased to 0 080 min 1 compared with the iron carbon based catalyst persulfate system and the degradation efficiency of bps was maintained at around 85 after four cycles density functional theory dft calculations showed that the introduction of moo2 reduced the reaction energy barrier of persulfate activated by catalysts to produce reactive species especially promoted the production of more high valent iron fe iv fe iv and reactive oxygen species so4 oh o2 and 1o2 worked together on the efficient degradation of bps in addition the test of an automatic circulating degradation plant had proved that fe mo cns had a good practical application prospect bps was mainly degraded by ring cleavage and o s o bond cleavage and the toxicity of bps and its intermediates were also evaluated this work clarifies the mechanism of improving the catalytic performance of heterogeneous iron based catalysts by moo2 in sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops providing a new idea for solving the blockage of fe2 fe3 cycle in sr aops graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords moo2 fe mo cns persulfate fe iv bps degradation 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have promising application in the treatment of refractory pollutants in the aqueous environment due to the higher redox potential 2 6 3 1 v and longer half life of so4 than traditional hydroxyl radical oh wacÅawek et al 2017 so4 is commonly produced by activating persulfate ps using external energy heat ultrasound uv liu et al 2020c or catalysts iron based catalysts are abundant cheap and efficient activators lyu et al 2020 compared with homogeneous fe2 heterogeneous fe based catalysts have the advantages of higher catalytic performance better environmental adaptability and reusability bu et al 2017 however heterogeneous iron based catalysts are prone to aggregation of active iron sites and active radicals such as so4 and oh are easily quenched by coexisting anions and natural organic matter nom both of significantly reduces the efficiency of pollutant treatment zheng et al 2019 iron carbon based materials contain a carbon network that not only disperses the iron sufficiently to prevent the aggregation of active sites but also accelerates the electron transfer between metal sites and persulfate promoting the generation of more reactive oxygen species ros and thus improving the adaptability of the catalysts to the actual environment gao et al 2021 he et al 2022 used an fe nitrogen doped carbon nanocomposite as a catalyst to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the effective degradation of sulfamethoxazole in water they demonstrated that the carbon network structure obtained by high temperature carbonization could adequately disperse the fe sites and promote the production of ros however after fe2 with high persulfate activation performance is oxidized to fe3 it is difficult to spontaneously complete the fe2 fe3 cycle due to the low reactivity between fe3 and persulfate which hinders the continued application of fe or fe carbon based catalysts in sr aops systems yi et al 2020 it is unwise to increase the amount of catalysts in order to improve the efficiency of pollutant treatment as this does not fundamentally solve the problem of the blocked reaction cycle but rather increases costs and produces more iron containing sludge therefore the addition of co catalysts to promote fe2 fe3 cycling in the reaction has attracted attention several studies have shown that metal sulfides mos2 ws2 dong et al 2018 xing et al 2018 and soluble reductants epigallocatechingallate and hydroxylamine bu et al 2017 hou et al 2017 can enhance the conversion of fe3 to fe2 in a fenton like system redox cycling of mo mo4 mo6 and w w4 w6 in mos2 and ws2 with fe2 fe3 can regenerate the active fe species but the metal sulfide may produce harmful h2s gas moreover the addition of a soluble reducing agent may cause secondary contamination in the reaction system molybdenum dioxide moo2 can be used as an alternative to mos2 due to its low cost and multivalent state shen et al introduced moo2 as a co catalyst in the fenton system to promote fe3 fe2 cycling and achieved efficient degradation of lissamine rhodamine b and rapid reduction of cr vi shen et al 2019 however most of the current research has focused on the role of moo2 in promoting iron cycling in homogeneous systems moo2 has been shown to improve the electronic conductivity of a metal carbon based electrochemical materials xia et al 2016 taken together these results imply that iron molybdenum carbon based materials could efficiently activate persulfate and promote fe2 fe3 cycling in sr aops the faster fe2 fe3 cycle would ensure that there are sufficient reactive species in the reaction and the higher electronic conductivity of catalysts is conducive to the electron transfer between catalysts persulfate and organics so as to promote the treatment of pollutants in the degradation system in addition to the traditional free radical and non free radical oxidants the role of fe iv is gaining interest in the research of the application of iron based catalysts in advanced oxidation systems zong et al 2021 xu et al prepared fes activated pms for the degradation of chloramphenicol and found a synergistic catalytic effect of fe iv as well but its contribution was less than that of so4 due to its low redox potential and weak competition ability xu and sheng 2021 chen et al found that the activation of persulfate by pre magnetized fe0 could greatly facilitate the degradation of p arsanilic acid due to the production of fe iv in the process chen et al 2021 therefore the reactive species produced in heterogeneous sr aops systems containing moo2 are worth investigating herein iron carbon based catalysts fe mo cns doped with a large number of active mo sites were synthesized by loading moo2 on fe cns material formed by carbonization of nh2 mil 101 fe the properties and mechanisms of persulfate activation by fe mo cns were systematically investigated as a common substitute for bisphenol a bps is not only more stable in the water environment but also has a longer toxic effect on humans and animals than bpa lu et al 2019 therefore bps was selected as the target pollutant to study the degradation performance of the as prepared catalysts the main objectives of this study were to 1 identify the main types of reactive species in the fe mo cns ps system 2 elucidate the role and mechanism of moo2 in promoting fe2 fe3 cycling in the reaction system 3 clarify the resistance of the fe mo cns ps system to environmental influences and the stability of fe mo cns recovery and 4 explore the potential of fe mo cns materials for practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents and catalysts preparation all chemicals and solvents used in the experiment can be found in text s1 in the supporting information and the preparation methods of different catalysts are provided in text s2 s4 2 2 characterization and bps degradation process all characterization used in the experiment and the bps degradation process can be found in text s5 and text s6 in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the preparation process of fe mo cns and fe cns is shown in fig 1 a the xrd images show the composition of fe mo cns and fe cns materials fig 1 b specifically a relatively high diffraction peak at 26 5 indicated that the fe mo cns contain more graphitized carbon the diffraction peaks at 37 8 42 9 45 0 45 9 58 0 and 83 0 in fe cns are attributed to the 210 211 031 112 301 and 332 crystalline planes of fe3c jcpds 85 1317 liu et al 2020c and similar diffraction peaks of fe3c 23 7 37 8 48 6 and 61 3 also exist in fe mo cns fig 1b a series of characteristic peaks appear at 37 0 53 3 53 7 60 4 66 8 and 79 0 corresponding to the 111 211 222 131 231 and 040 crystalline planes of moo2 jcpds 76 1807 wei et al 2020 in fe mo cns respectively moreover as the mo fe ratio increases the corresponding diffraction peaks of moo2 in the catalysts become progressively more pronounced fig s1a ft ir spectra of the fe mo cns and fe cns show the characteristic peaks at 560 cm 1 and 1450 1650 cm 1 corresponding to the fe o vibration and o c o stretching respectively of the two catalysts fig s1b in particular fe mo cns has a stronger signal value than fe cns at 3470 cm 1 indicating that fe mo cns contains more vc n group combined with xrd images fig s1a fe mo cns contained more nitrogen species which might be due to the addition of more ammonium molybdate during the synthesis process as shown in figs s2a and s2b fe cns presented stacked nanosheet structure both on the whole and inside and contained irregular channels inside the morphology of fe mo cns showed more regular aggregates fig 1c which might be due to the aggregation of a layer of moo2 particles on the surface of the carbon structure and the wrapping effect of moo2 allowed the catalyst to possess a more regular shape in addition the wrapping effect of moo2 did not affect the formation of irregular channels inside fe mo cns fig s3 to further understand the internal structure of the catalysts tem images of fe mo cns and fe cns at different magnifications were provided figs 1d and s2c d showing the dispersed metal nanoparticles coated with the carbon network structure in both catalysts the tem mapping images further confirmed that fe nanoparticles were wrapped by carbon network structure in fe cns while fe and mo were roughly uniformly dispersed in the same location in fe mo cns suggesting that the carbon shell encasing the fe nanoparticles was accompanied by a moo2 layer in fe mo cns in addition the carbon shell of fe mo cns was composed of multi layer nanosheets with a crystal spacing of 0 349 nm which was very close to that of graphite 0 35 nm the three dimensional network structure of the carbon and moo2 layers not only provided dual protection for the fe3c nanoparticles but also might improve the electron conduction ability of the catalyst xia et al 2016 in addition xps analysis was used to further explore the chemical composition of the catalysts as shown in fig s4 a compared with fe cns the peak position of fe species in fe mo cns did not change significantly it can be found that the peaks at 709 39 and 722 79 ev corresponds to fe2 while the peaks at 712 66 and 726 70 ev were attributed to fe3 in particular fe mo cns have large fe n peaks at 711 15 and 724 68 ev which is attributed to the incorporation of nitrogen species into the fe mo cns by ammonium molybdate sun et al 2021 and different nitrogen species were observed in fe mo cns including pyridnic n 397 44 ev pyrrolic n 398 47 ev graphitic n 399 79 ev and mo n bonds 396 11 ev li et al 2019 fig s4b the mo 3d spectra showed that fe mo cns mainly contained two mo species mo iv 232 88 and 229 46 ev and mo vi 232 45 and 235 79 ev fig s4c liu et al 2020b wei et al 2020 3 2 effect of moo2 on catalytic performance of catalysts the effect of moo2 on the catalytic properties was investigated using catalysts with different fe mo ratios to activate persulfate for the degradation of bps fig 2 a the results showed that the catalytic performance of fexmoy cns did not improve compared to fe cns when the mo content was low figs s5 and s6 and the degradation rate of bps in the fe2 5mo1 cns ps system decreased to 0 032 min 1 instead fig 2b this might be due to the fact that small amounts of moo2 did not contribute sufficiently to the fe2 fe3 cycling with a further increase in moo2 content the catalytic performance of fe mo cns gradually improved and the degradation rate of bps in the fe mo cns ps system 0 058 min 1 was about 1 7 times higher than that of the fe cns ps system 0 035 min 1 this indicated that the introduction of an appropriate amount of moo2 improved the ability of nitrogen doped iron carbon catalysts to activate ps thus promoting the treatment of bps in the reaction system in addition bps was not degraded when the catalyst was absent suggesting that it was difficult for persulfate alone to produce reactive radicals the cns obtained after the removal of fe and mo from the fe mo cns are also incapable of activating ps figs 2c and s7b furthermore the bps was not degraded in the mo cns ps system indicating that moo2 was not the active site for the activation of persulfate compared to the other systems the highest bps degradation rate and efficiency of 0 058 min 1 and 100 respectively were achieved in the fe mo cns ps system within 70 min fig 2d indicating that the fe sites may be the main active sites for the activation of ps and the introduction of moo2 enhanced the ability of the original fe based catalysts to activate ps and degrade the contaminants in addition the basic conditions of the fe mo cns ps system were determined by the influence of catalyst dosage and persulfate concentration fig s8 3 3 role of moo2 in the production of reactive species to investigate the reactive species in the fe mo cns ps and fe cns ps systems methanol meoh tert butanol tba p benzoquinone p bq and l histidine were chosen as the trapping agents for so4 oh o2 and 1o2 respectively ding et al 2021 when 2 mm l histidine was added to the fe mo cns ps system the degradation efficiency of bps dropped significantly to 7 4 and the degradation rate slowed down to 0 001 min 1 figs 3 a and s9d similarly after the introduction of meoh 500 mm tba 500 mm and p bq 2mm into the system the degradation efficiency of bps was inhibited to 10 6 30 7 and 41 7 respectively and with the increase of the concentration of the four capture agents the degree of inhibition of bps degradation gradually increased figs 3b 3d and s9 indicating that the four ros cooperate to degrade bps and the free radical capture experiments also showed that so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were involved in the bps degradation process in the fe cns ps system fig s10 some o2 in sr aops may be generated from the dissolved oxygen in the reaction when the dissolved oxygen was removed by ar fig s11 the degradation rate of bps in the fe mo cns ps system decreased slightly from 0 084 min 1 to 0 076 min 1 but it could still be completely decomposed within 70 min fig s12a in the fe cns ps system bps degradation was significantly inhibited which indicates that dissolved oxygen is involved in the formation of o2 fig s12b therefore moo2 accelerates the fe2 fe3 cycle in the fe mo cns ps system leading to the rapid formation of ros in the reaction especially the generation of o2 which hardly requires the participation of dissolved oxygen the in situ electron paramagnetic resonance epr was adopted to inspect the radicals generation and evolution during bps degradation 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was selected as the capture agent for so4 oh and o2 and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperi done temp was used for 1o2 ali et al 2021 qin et al 2021 no radicals were detected when only persulfate was present fig 3e however significant characteristic signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were observed in the fe mo cns ps system indicating that the efficient activation of ps by fe mo cns rapidly generated so4 and oh in addition 1o2 and o2 signals were detected in the fe mo cns ps system fig 3f without moo2 in the fe cns ps system the corresponding signals of active radicals so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were also detected fig s13 to further distinguish the relative contributions of free and non free radical oxidation pathways to bps degradation the competitive kinetics experiments were performed using a mixture system of nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba p benzoquinone p bq furfuryl alcohol ffa and bps figs s14 and s15 based on the reported studies xie et al 2022 and experimentally obtained second order rate constants between bps and ros fig s16 and tables s2 and s3 the steady state concentrations of the four ros species were calculated as shown in fig 3g the steady state concentrations of ros in the fe mo cns ps system were 0 5 10 12 m for oh 1 2 10 11 m for so4 3 1 10 12 m for o2 and 4 3 10 10 m for 1o2 respectively all higher than those in the fe cns ps system 0 3 10 12 m for oh 4 0 10 12 m for so4 0 4 10 12 m for o2 and 4 7 10 11 m for 1o2 therefore the relative contribution of so4 oh and 1o2 in the fe mo cns ps system were 82 5 1 6 and 2 3 respectively fig s16e and table s4 compared with the fe cns ps system 2 0 for oh 61 1 for so4 and 0 56 for 1o2 the increased contribution of so4 and 1o2 in the fe mo cns ps system suggested that the introduction of moo2 promoted the production of so4 and 1o2 in the reaction thus facilitating the degradation of bps in both systems the free radical oxidation pathways played a dominant role in the degradation of bps than the non radical pathway recent studies suggest that a new active substance fe iv may be involved in some homogeneous fe2 ps systems which could be verified by a specific rapid reaction with pmso to produce pmso2 chen et al 2021 li et al 2021 yan et al 2021 therefore the contribution of fe iv to the degradation of bps in our system was investigated by measuring the concentrations of pmso and pmso2 in both catalytic systems after 70 min of reaction the concentration of pmso decreased significantly from 1 mm to 0 02 mm and a large amount of pmso2 was produced from 0 mm to 0 82 mm fig 4 a indicating that a significant amount of fe iv was generated in the fe mo cns ps system however in the fe cns system the concentration of pmso decreased slightly from 1 mm to 0 95 mm and trace amounts of pmso2 were generated indicating no significant fe iv production in the absence of moo2 fig 4b moo2 loaded on the catalysts may promote fe2 fe3 cycling thus increasing the production of fe2 in the degradation system and simultaneously generating fe iv the conversion rate Î· pmso2 from pmso to pmso2 in the reaction could be used to investigate the contribution of fe iv to the degradation of the pollutants the Î· pmso2 reached 93 8 in the fe mo cns ps system fig s17a which might be due to the reaction between some pmso and ros affecting the production rate of pmso2 after adding bps to the system Î· pmso2 decreased to 83 7 in the fe mo cns ps bps system indicating that about 11 fe iv was actively involved in the degradation of bps in addition pmso was used as the trapping agent to further confirm the beneficial role of fe iv in the catalysts ps bps systems the degradation efficiency of bps in the fe mo cns ps system was inhibited to 67 2 and the degradation rate decreased from 0 080 min 1 to 0 014 min 1 fig 4c however since only a small amount of fe iv was present in the fe cns ps system the degradation efficiency of bps was minimally inhibited by pmso and was only reduced by 10 fig 4d these results again suggest that fe iv does play an important role in the degradation of bps in order to determine the effect of different catalyst structures and composition on fe iv formation homogeneous fe2 ps and fe2 moo2 ps systems were selected to investigate the effect of moo2 on fe iv production as shown in fig s17 the presence of moo2 in fe2 moo2 ps system significantly promoted the production of fe iv compared to fe2 ps system however the production of pmso2 0 72 mm and Î· pmso2 71 74 were less than that of the fe mo cns ps system which may be due to the carbon nitrogen network in the heterogeneous materials facilitating the electron transfer during the reaction thus promoting the production of fe iv 3 4 exploration of ps activation mechanism in the fe mo cns ps system the activation of ps by iron carbon based catalysts is often accompanied by metal redox reaction and the generation of reactive oxygen species the most critical first step is that electron rich fe sites provides electrons to s2o8 2 and generate so4 eqs 1 and 2 and the fe2 fe3 cycle becomes the key that limits the generation of ros therefore xps analysis was used to study the chemical properties of the fe mo cns and fe cns before and after the reaction to clarify the effect of moo2 on the persulfate activation mechanism fig 5 a and 5b the fe2 fe3 ratio of fe mo cns increased from 0 658 to 0 664 after the reaction table s5 while the fe2 fe3 ratio of fe cns decreased from 0 811 to 0 477 after the reaction table s6 indicating that the fe2 fe3 cycle in the fe cns ps system was greatly inhibited to further verify that moo2 promoted fe2 fe3 cycling in the reaction fe3 was introduced into the fe mo cns ps system and it was found that the degradation rate of bps increased from 0 080 min 1 to 0 194 min 1 when fe3 concentration increased to 30 mg l 1 however the homogeneous fe3 ps system could hardly degrade bps and the degradation rate of bps was only 0 0008 min 1 when fe3 concentration was 30 mg l 1 which proved the high efficiency of fe2 fe3 cycling efficiency in fe mo cns ps system fig s18 in fe mo cns mo4 in moo2 reacted with fe3 to generate fe2 and mo6 which not only promoted the fe2 fe3 cycle but also facilitated the production of ros and fe iv during the reaction eqs 3 and 4 dong et al 2021 however the proportion of mo4 mo6 in fe mo cns increased from 0 299 to 0 656 table s7 which may be caused by the reaction of mo6 with o2 the increase of mo4 content was also conducive to further promoting the fe2 fe3 cycle and mo4 mo6 in the reaction moreover the resulting so4 could react with h2o to produce oh eq 5 o2 was produced by a two step reaction of s2o8 2 with h2o eqs 6 and 7 while o2 contributed to the production of 1o2 through reaction with h2o or mo6 eqs 8 and 9 yi et al 2019 finally bps was efficiently degraded by free radicals and non radical species in the fe mo cns ps system fig 5c 1 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 s o 4 s o 4 2 2 f e 3 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 s 2 o 8 3 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2

6 1 o 2 m o 4 3 5 density functional theory density functional theory dft was used to analyze the influence of moo2 on the production of reactive oxygen species ros and fe iv in the iron carbon based catalysts ps system the optimized structure of the catalysts for the adsorption of s2o8 2 as well as the optimized structures of intermediates transition states and products of reactive species are shown in figs 6 a and s19 the breaking of the o o bond is an important step in the activation of ps to produce active species especially so4 duan et al 2021a as shown in fig 6 b and 6 c the energy barrier required to produce so4 was the lowest compared to the other three ros oh o2 and 1o2 which emphasized that the generation of so4 is a key step in the activation of ps and also suggested that ps was readily activated in the fe mo cns ps and fe cns ps systems in the fe mo cns ps system after s2o8 2 is adsorbed on the catalyst surface the bond length of o108 o105 l o108 o105 increases and the s o bonds on both sides are stretched which may be caused by bonding between s and mo in the process of further activation the bond angles between s107 o105 o108 and s106 o108 o105 are opened the l o108 o105 further lengthens the s mo bond is broken and the s fe bond is also shortened which prepares for the release of one so4 fig s20a after the release of a so4 the s fe bond lengthens which creates the conditions for the continued production of so4 however in the fe cns ps system although the generation of so4 is accompanied by an increase in the o o bond length l o99 o96 the s fe bond grows and then shortens during the reaction which is not conducive to the continued production of so4 fig s21a in addition the fe mo cns ps system has a lower energy barrier for so4 compared to the fe cns ps system which again demonstrates that the introduction of moo2 facilitates the continuous production of so4 by ps activation fig 6b and 6c the generation of s2o8 is also an essential first step in the generation of o2 and 1o2 according to eqs 6 and 7 s2o8 could react with h2o in solution to produce ho2 which reacts with s2o8 2 to generate so4 and o2 therefore according to the key transition state analysis of o2 and 1o2 generation in the fe mo cns ps system o2 and 1o2 were formed initially as the l o108 o105 grew and the bond angle between s107 o105 o108 increased which might be caused by the rupture of a s o bond in s2o8 2 fig s20c and s20d when a steady state o2 was formed the l o108 o105 shortened and the bond angles between mo97 s106 o108 and fe50 s107 o105 increased indicating that the remainder of s2o8 2 gradually stablizes while the l o109 o111 of o2 remains unchanged fig s20c this suggested that the presence of moo2 promoted the electronic conductivity of the catalyst leaving o2 in a stable state when generated in addition the energy barrier value formed by 1o2 is higher than that of o2 15 75 kcal mol 1 17 72 kcal mol 1 this might be due to the fact that 1o2 is formed by the reaction of o2 with h2o which requires further absorption of energy in the reaction to complete the stable formation of 1o2 in the fe cns ps system although the formation process of o2 and 1o2 was similar to that of the fe mo cns ps system figs s19 and s21 the energy barrier values were higher 15 75 kcal mol 1 22 51 kcal mol 1 for o2 and 17 72 kcal mol 1 25 34 kcal mol 1 for 1o2 fig 6 moreover the o99 o96 bond for the formation of o2 became longer during the reaction in the fe cns ps system which indicated that the final o2 might be in an unstable state however in both fe mo cns ps and fe cns ps systems the energy barrier values required for the formation of oh were the highest which might be caused by the complexity of the generation of oh that is so4 were first generated in the reaction and then reacted with h2o to generate oh the energy barrier formation process of oh also indicated that there was a free o atom in the intermediate state at the highest energy barrier value fig 6a the free o atom combined with an h atom to form oh which might be provided by a h2o molecule a similar process of oh generation occurred in the fe cns ps system but the energy barrier value 31 98 kcal mol 1 was higher than that in the fe mo cns ps system 21 98 kcal mol 1 fig 6b and 6c in addition to the unchanged l o99 o96 in the fe cns fig s21b these indicated that the introduction of moo2 accelerated the shortening of o o bond thus promoting the production of oh therefore the introduction of moo2 makes the formation of ros in the reaction more convenient the influence of moo2 on fe iv generation in the reaction system was further revealed by dft calculations fig 6d when ps is activated by fe ii the reactant fe ii h2o 5 s2o8 int 1 undergoes o o bond dissociation to form fe iii h2o 5 s2o8 int 2 through the transition state ts 1 c with an energy barrier of 7 214 kcal mol 1 then fe iv h2o 5 s2o8 2 products is obtained by an endothermic process 11 266 kcal mol 1 with the total energy barrier of 8 065 kcal mol 1 for the whole reaction process in the fe ii ps moo2 system the energy barrier for the formation of fe iii h2o 5 s2o8 moo2 int 2 from the reactant fe ii h2o 5 s2o8 moo2 int 1 via the transition state ts 1 c is 3 965 kcal mol 1 in addition fe iv h2o 5 s2o8 moo2 2 products is further generated via an endothermic step 9 229 kcal mol 1 and the total energy barrier for fe iv generation is 3 965 kcal mol 1 therefore it has been thermodynamically demonstrated that the introduction of moo2 favors the formation of fe iv and thus greatly facilitated the activation of ps 3 6 improved electrochemical properties of catalysts with moo2 to better reveal the advantages of the catalytic performance of fe mo cns electrochemical analysis of the catalysts was performed duan et al 2021b wang et al 2022 as shown in fig s22 a when ps 3 mm and bps 5 mg l 1 was added to the test system the current intensity was stronger for fe mo cns than for fe cns in the i t curve indicating a stronger electron transfer between fe mo cns bps and ps the cv and lsv curves showed that fe mo cns exhibited a stronger current density than fe cns fig s22b and s22c suggesting that moo2 enhanced the electron transport capacity of fe mo cns the electrochemical properties of fe mo cns showed that the introduction of moo2 improved the electron conductivity of the catalysts and promoted the activation of ps 3 7 enhanced resistance of moo2 containing catalysts to the effects of different environmental conditions the effect of different temperatures on bps degradation were studied figs s23 and s24 as the temperature increases 25 c 40 c the degradation rates of bps increased from 0 080 min 1 to 0 129 min 1 in the fe mo cns ps system especially when the temperature reached 40 c bps was completely degraded within 10 min figs s23a and s24a the activation energy ea kj mol of the fe mo cns ps system calculated from the arrhenius equation was 23 66 kj mol which was lower than that of the fe cns ps system 31 31 kj mol indicating better activation performance of fe mo cns fig s25 due to the crucial role of ph in ps decomposition the degradation of bps in terms of ph was determined it was observed that the fe mo cns ps system could effectively degrade bps over a wide ph range 3 0 9 0 fig s23c whereas the fe cns ps system inhibited the degradation of bps at all ph conditions except ph 7 6 fig s23d indicating the better resistance to ph fluctuations of fe mo cns the inorganic anions and natural organic matter nom in actual water can quench free radicals in the reaction system and further affect the degradation of pollutants ji et al 2021 therefore the ability of the fe mo cns ps system to resist interference from the coexisting anions cl so4 2 and hco3 and nom homic acid ha was investigated figs s26 and s27 the effect of cl on the degradation of bps was not significant and the catalytic degradation rate of bps could achieve 0 075 min 1 even at high cl concentrations as the so4 2 concentration increased the degradation efficiency of bps remained high despite the rate of degradation was somewhat inhibited and fluctuations in so4 2 concentration had little effect on the degradation rate of contaminants the inhibition of bps degradation by hco3 was due to the fact that hco3 not only increases the ph of the reaction but also reacts with so4 and oh to produce hco3 and co3 which have lower oxidation properties although so4 2 and hco3 had some inhibitory effect on the degradation of bps in the fe mo cns ps it was much weaker than that in the fe cns ps fig s28 furthermore in the presence of ha bps degraded approximately 95 in fe mo cns ps within 70 min despite a decrease in k from 0 080 to 0 043 min 1 as the ha concentration increased to 10 mg l 1 fig s26d and s27d however at the same high ha concentration the degradation efficiency of bps in fe cns ps decreased from 93 4 to 50 1 and the degradation rate was greatly suppressed from 0 036 to 0 010 min 1 figs s28d and s29d due to the synergistic effect of fe iv in the fe mo cns ps bps system it is also important to investigate the effects of inorganic anions and nom on the fe iv production the presence of cl so4 2 hco3 and ha reduced the Î· pmso2 in the fe2 ps moo2 system from 71 7 to 54 1 70 3 69 3 and 70 2 respectively fig s30 in contrast Î· pmso2 in the fe mo cns ps system only decreased from 93 8 to 85 9 88 6 61 1 and 91 7 under the influence of the same concentration of anions and ha fig s31 indicating that the heterogeneous fe mo cns ps system not only increased the yield of fe iv but also improved the environmental interference resistance of fe iv generation in conclusion the fe mo cns ps system was more resistant to the effects of the external environment 3 8 moo2 improved the reusability of the catalysts to investigate the reusability of the catalysts cycling experiments were carried out for the fe mo cns ps and fe cns ps system respectively in the fe mo cns ps system the degradation efficiency of bps could be maintained above 85 after four cycles despite a slight decrease fig 7 a whereas in fe cns ps the degradation efficiency dropped dramatically to 23 0 after three cycles fig 7b the bps and its products absorbed on the surface of the used catalyst may be one of the reasons for the reduced performance of the catalysts after several uses however compared to fe cns fe mo cns possessed higher cycling stability and were more suitable for long term treatment of environmental pollutants this is mainly due to the fact that the moo2 in fe mo cns promoted fe2 fe3 cycling which largely solved the problem of reduced activation of ps due to the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 making fe mo cns more durable and the fundamental reason for the dramatic decrease in the catalytic performance of fe cns was the blocked fe2 fe3 cycling moreover xrd analysis showed that the basic crystal structure of the fe mo cns did not change significantly which also indicated the stability of the fe mo cns in the reaction fig s32 to realize practical application of the fe mo cns ps system we designed a pollutant degradation plant that operated automatically at laboratory conditions and the flow chart was shown in fig 7 c the whole degradation equipment included the power equipment two peristaltic pumps the degradation tank a solution bottle and a reaction column fig s33 under the dynamic action of two peristaltic pumps a mixture 1 l of bps 5 mg l 1 and ps 3 mm flowed through the reaction column filled with several high density melamine sponges containing 15 mg fe mo cns powder the entire flow system maintained stable operation at room temperature as shown in fig 7 d the degradation efficiency of bps was consistently above 95 after four flow experiments each running continuously for 120 min this phenomenon further confirmed the excellent stability and persistence of fe mo cns due to the accelerated cyclic conversion of fe2 fe3 by moo2 furthermore no catalysts were found to fall off the sponge during the experiment indicating the practical use of the catalyst sponge module moreover different kinds of organic pollutants including bisphenol a bpa bisphenol f bpf carbamazepine cbz norfloxacin nfx clothianidin cad and rhodamine b rhb have good degradation efficiency in the fe mo cns ps system fig s34 these attempts provided a new choice for the engineering application of the catalysts in sr aops 3 9 bps degradation pathway and toxicity prediction of intermediates in order to explore the degradation mechanism of bps dft was used to predict the vulnerable positions of bps molecules fig 8 and table s8 according to the calculated fukui index c1 c5 c12 c14 o22 o24 o26 and o27 in bps were all active sites which were able to be attacked by free radical the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals homo and lumo of bps showed that the electron density was mainly concentrated in the phenyl ring o26 and o27 the hplc ms analysis was used to further investigate the intermediates of bps degradation figs 8d and s35 the sulfonated product s1 m z 344 80 underwent cyclic cleavage to produce s2 m z 192 90 in the reaction but no subsequent degradation reaction was found for s2 and carboxylated product s15 m z 293 00 therefore o s o bond breakage and ring cleavage are the main degradation paths of bps in the fe mo cns ps system the c3 and c16 sites in bps molecules have high f value and are susceptible attack by radicals such as so4 after removing phenolic groups the hydroxylated product s3 m z 173 00 was generated on the one hand s7 m z 180 90 was produced by addition reaction and s8 m z 152 75 and s9 m z 221 94 were further formed by c c bond breaking on the other hand the o s o bond were attacked to form s4 m z 162 88 s5 m z 267 43 and s6 m z 156 92 due to the high activity of o26 and o27 the o s o bond could also be directly broken to form s16 m z 234 83 and s17 m z 216 97 in the degradation path ii and further cleaved to form s4 in the degradation process iii s11 m z 236 84 could be formed by self coupling reaction c12 o22 and c5 o24 after oxygen atom transfer reaction zong et al 2020 fe iv could further attack s11 to form s12 m z 251 00 and s12 forms s13 m z 270 84 and s14 m z 112 83 through ring cleavage the formation of s12 further proved that fe iv was involved in the reaction but the reactivity of fe iv toward organic pollutants was usually weaker than that of free radicals zong et al 2021 so paths i and ii were the main degradation paths of bps finally all products were mineralized to co2 and h2o in the fe mo cns ps system four representative indexes including acute toxicity developmental toxicity bioaccumulation factors and mutagenicity were selected to evaluate the environmental friendliness of bps degradation in the fe mo cns ps system by the quantitative structural activity relationship qsar prediction as shown in fig s36 and table s9 the acute toxicity lc50 of bps was about 17 21 mg l for fathead minnow which is a toxic substance most of the degradation products were less toxic compared to bps although a few intermediates s13 s16 and s17 showed a slight increase in toxicity but these intermediates were transient and their final products s2 s6 and s8 were harmless this indicated that the higher the oxidation degree of the intermediates the less acute toxicity the changes of developmental toxicity and bioaccumulation factors were similar to those of acute toxicity except for a few intermediates the developmental toxicity and bioaccumulation factors of all the products were decreased which may be due to the reduced lipophilicity of the products the mutagenicity index showed that although the toxicity of most intermediates increased the mutagenicity was almost all negative therefore after toxicity prediction and evaluation the fe mo cns ps system could effectively reduce the potential risk of bps in the ecosystem 4 conclusions in this paper fe mo cns was synthesized by loading moo2 on the fe cns through a simple two step method dft calculation combined with experiments showed that the fe mo cns had a higher activation performance for ps than fe cns and the fe mo cns ps system was more likely to produce ros due to the fe2 fe3 cycle in the reaction facilitated by moo2 epr analyses and quenching experiments proved that reactive oxygen species so4 oh o2 and 1o2 and fe iv worked together on the degradation of bps in the fe mo cns ps system especially after moo2 was introduced into the catalyst more fe iv was produced in the fe mo cns ps system fe mo cns had stronger environmental adaptability and higher cycling stability than fe cns in addition fe mo cns showed good prospects for engineering application with the degradation rate of bps in fe mo cns ps reaching about 95 within 8 h in the experimental reactor future research should focus on further improving the activation performance of catalysts and optimizing the industrial application of powder catalysts ring cleavage and o s o bond cleavage were the main degradation methods of bps and the toxicity of bps was reduced after degradation by the fe mo cns ps system with the development of the sr aops this study provides a new choice for overcoming the obstacles of iron carbon materials in practical

15454,the bismuth oxide bi2o3 based chloride cl removal method is one of the chemical precipitation methods possessing good selectivity and high removal efficiency of cl ions but bi2o3 often appears in the powder form which is difficult to be recovered for regeneration in this work the combination of 3d printing technology and the bi2o3 method was explored to construct the resin model including the bi precursors in the optimum carbonization process at 400 c for 30 min the bi3 ions of the bi precursor were reduced into the metallic bi0 nanoparticles whose surfaces were covered by the thin bi2o3 layers to form the heterostructured bi0 bi2o3 core shell nanoparticles with an average size of 43 nm these bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles were tightly adhered to the internal and external surfaces of the hierarchical porous carbon model bi pcm which greatly facilitated their regeneration and ensured the stable cl removal performance after five cycles of cl removal the chloride removal efficiency over the multiple bi pcms in the dark and ph 1 conditions maintained at about 26 which then largely increased to 63 6 with uv light irradiation the light enhanced mechanism was related to the improved release rate of bi3 ions caused by photocorrosion and the cl radicals produced from the holes and the oh and o2 radicals which quickly reacted with bi2o3 to form biocl the construction of bi pcms by using 3d printing technology provides a very promising strategy for the removal of cl ions from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 3d printing bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles chloride removal efficiency photocorrosion active free radicals data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years whether the wastewater generated in industrial production activities or landfill leachate generated in daily life both contain high concentrations of chloride cl ions cao et al 2022 if appropriate treatment is not taken the cl ions will cause great environmental harm and economic loss such as the corrosivity towards metallic facilities the salinization of fresh water and soil the inhibition of crop growth the formation of chlorine related carcinogens and the robbery of active radicals to decrease the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants huang et al 2020 li et al 2022 the cl removal methods of chemical precipitation ion exchange electrochemistry membrane separation and evaporation have been mainly reported dou et al 2022 li et al 2022 sun et al 2021 xin et al 2020 but there are still some problems such as high operation cost and secondary pollution and most of them cannot be used in real wastewater treatment it is noted that among the chemical precipitation methods the bismuth oxide bi2o3 method has better selectivity and stability compared with those of the friedel s salt and cuprous chloride precipitation methods dou et al 2019 guo et al 2021 huang et al 2020 li et al 2021 sun et al 2020 wu et al 2022 the cl removal principle of bi2o3 is realized by the formation of bismuth oxychloride biocl but most of the bi2o3 materials used are present in the powder form dou et al 2022 li et al 2022 which are readily soluble in acid solution resulting in their large loss during the cl removal process if the bi2o3 powder can be tightly attached on a large substrate its stability will be greatly improved to reduce its loss and prolong the lifetime of cl removal to find a suitable substrate for the bi2o3 powder a porous model constructed by 3d printing may be a good option 3d printing is attributed to an additive manufacturing method that converts digital model files into physical object models chang et al 2019 rossi et al 2017 where the resin models can be produced by the liquid crystal display lcd technology kafle et al 2021 liu et al 2021 to realize the cl removal performance of the resin models the bi precursors can be included in the photosensitive resin through the lcd photocuring 3d printing technology the bi contained resin models are constructed and after a high temperature pyrolysis carbonization treatment the new porous models containing the bi based chloride removal agents can be obtained for the bi related phases in addition to bi2o3 there will be the metallic bi0 particles generated from the reduction reaction of bi3 ions in the carbonization process these bi0 particles have localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect to produce hot electrons and holes wang et al 2021 and the cl ions in wastewater can be oxidized by them to form the chlorine cl radicals which are conducive to improving the chloride removal efficiency researches showed that the particle size of bi2o3 was closely related to the cl removal performance especially for the size effect of quantum dots or two dimensional materials huang et al 2020 up to now the common bi2o3 materials used for cl removal have large particle sizes dou et al 2019 li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 and the cl removal product of biocl is easy to deposit on the surface of bi2o3 to prevent the further release of its inner bi3 ions resulting in the low utilization rate of bi3 and its excessive dosage added in the cl removal process however in the carbonization process of the bi contained resin model the bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles can be generated from the adhesion and dispersion properties of the porous carbon which have high activity for the cl removal as for the cl removal product of biocl they can be easily regenerated with an alkaline solution and then the resultant bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles can still tightly adhere to the porous carbon surface which are used as the chloride removal agents again importantly in the entire cl removal and regeneration process the loss of bi will be greatly reduced in this study the bi contained precursor powder was mixed with the liquid photosensitive resin and through the 3d printing and the subsequent pyrolysis carbonization the hierarchical porous carbon model loaded with bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles bi pcm was obtained to determine the optimum preparation parameters various kinds of bi pcms were prepared under different carbonization temperatures and times by observing the shape retention the best bi pcm was obtained the removal experiments of cl ions in wastewater were first performed over one single bi pcm under the dark environment with different ph values and based on the optimum ph the uv light irradiation was introduced over the multiple bi pcms to investigate the cl removal performance the structure morphology and composition of the pcms before and after the cl removal experiments were studied and compared and the cl removal mechanism was discussed based on the photocorrosion and the active radicals the concentration of bi3 ions in wastewater after cl removal was tested and the shape of bi pcm was recorded to evaluate the stability performance finally the resultant product containing biocl biocl pcm was regenerated with naoh solution and its cyclic cl removal performance was tested 2 experimental methods 2 1 reagents and materials h2so4 98 ethanol bi no3 3 5h2o and naoh were obtained from shanghai lingfeng chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china acetone was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china nacl was obtained from qiangsheng functional chemical co ltd jiangsu china photosensitive resin uv curable polyurethane acrylate resin was obtained from guanghua weiye co ltd shenzhen china all the above reagents were of analytical reagent grade 2 2 preparation of the bi pcms 2 2 1 preparation of the 3d printed resin models 10 g bi no3 3 5h2o powder was weighed and ground thoroughly and then 12 ml acetone was added fig 1 a after ultrasonic dispersion for 2 min 100 ml photosensitive resin was added the resultant bi no3 3 5h2o resin mixture was stirred evenly with a glass rod and then was ultrasonically dispersed for 10 min in the dark it can be seen that the liquid photosensitive resin changed from transparent yellow to milky white after adding bi no3 3 5h2o indicating the bi no3 3 5h2o powder has been uniformly distributed in the resin after ultrasonic treatment pouring the mixed bi no3 3 5h2o resin into the resin hopper of the lcd light curing 3d printer creality ld 006 fig 1b the 3d printed digital models were designed as porous cylinders the printing parameters were set as follows the total exposure time for the bottom three layers was 90 s and that of each other layer was 3 s the uv light with a wavelength of 405 nm emitted by the light source was dispersed by the focusing lens and then was irradiated upward through the lcd screen and the bi no3 3 5h2o resin was cured layer by layer on the platform finally the resin models containing bi no3 3 5h2o with many pores and different sizes were formed in comparison with the pristine model fig 1c the details were completely retained and the accuracy of printing was not influenced by the added bi no3 3 5h2o meanwhile the transparency of the pristine model was changed to the milky white color of the bi no3 3 5h2o resin models with the same composition fig 1d f indicating the bi no3 3 5h2o powder was uniformly distributed in the resin after ultrasonic dispersion 2 2 2 carbonization of the 3d printed resin models the obtained 3d printed resin models were first washed with ethanol and distilled water and were dried naturally in a fume hood these dried 3d resin models were put into a crucible which was then placed in a muffle furnace for carbonization fig 1g for comparison five calcination temperatures of 100 200 300 400 and 500 c and different times were performed and then different bi pcms were obtained by comparing their appearance morphology and structural characteristics the optimum bi pcm was achieved fig 1h 2 3 cl removal performance 2 3 1 one single bi pcm 50 ml simulated wastewater containing 500 mg l of cl ions was obtained by using nacl and distilled water the ph of the wastewater was adjusted to 1 2 3 or 5 with the concentrated h2so4 one of the optimum bi pcm was added into the wastewater fig 2 which was stirred at 500 r min for 2 h in the dark and the concentration of cl ions was detected on a universal ion chromatograph oic 600 orion electronic technology co ltd beijing china when the cl removal reaction was finished the resultant biocl pcm was obtained and taken out after drying in an oven at 85 c the biocl pcm was directly put into 50 ml naoh solution 2 mol l for the cleavage of cl ions 200 r min 1 h and the bi pcm was formed again which was then taken out and rinsed with distilled water and placed in an oven at 80 c for drying this wet regenerated bi pcm continued to remove cl ions in the simulated wastewater and the removal experiments were terminated after five cycles 2 3 2 multiple bi pcms a cl removal system was designed fig 3 and fig s1 where seven bi pcms were put into a quartz tube one end of the quartz tube was connected to a peristaltic pump for water inflow and the other end was for water outlet 2 l simulated wastewater containing 500 mg l of cl ions ph 1 or 2 was prepared by using the peristaltic pump the wastewater was pumped into the quartz tube when the quartz tube was filled with wastewater a low pumping speed was set during 5 h of cl removal reaction in the dark or uv 253 7 nm light irradiation condition room temperature all the 2 l wastewater could be passed through the quartz tube and 10 ml of the final wastewater was taken out for detection when the wastewater in the quartz tube was emptied out the naoh solution 2 mol l was pumped and filled the cleavage of cl ions of biocl pcms was completed after 2 h of storage when the naoh solution was emptied out the wet regenerated bi pcms were obtained which were reused to remove cl ions in the fresh 2 l simulated wastewater the initial ph of the wastewater in the quartz tube was adjusted to 1 by adding some h2so4 since the residual amount of naoh in the regenerated bi pcms was very small after the first cycle removal of cl ions the biocl pcms were regenerated and reused and five cycles were performed to further investigate the cl removal performance of the bi pcms a real desulfurization wastewater table s1 with cl concentration of 3191 mg l and initial ph of 2 54 ph was adjusted to 1 was chosen and the five cycles of removal experiments were performed as mentioned above 2 4 characterizations the crystal phases of the samples before and after cl removal and wet regeneration were tested on an x ray diffractometer xrd philips x pert powder diffractometer the morphology and element distribution of the samples were measured by using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss sigma 500 and its own energy dispersive spectrometer eds and before analysis the samples were pretreated by gold spraying the microstructures were also observed by a transmission electron microscope tem philips tecnai g2 f30 and the high resolution tem hrtem images were analyzed by the digital micrograph software the surface chemical states of the samples were measured on the thermo scientific k alpha x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps system which was operated in the constant analyser energy cae mode and the c 1s peak at 284 8 ev was used as a reference to calibrate the positions of other peaks the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the samples were tested at 77 k by using the quantachrome autosorb iq 2mp analyser system an icap6300 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo electron corp was used to detect the concentration of bi3 ions in the wastewater after cl removal 2 5 active free radical capture and quenching in the cl removal process the oh and o2 radicals generated on bi pcm biocl pcm and the regenerated bi pcm were detected by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo a part of the models was taken and ground into powders for each capture experiment 15 mg of the solid powder sample and 10 Âµl dmpo were added into a 3 ml glass bottle including a small rotor and then 1 ml distilled water for oh or methanol for o2 was added upon uv light irradiation for 10 min the resultant solutions after centrifugation were detected on a bruker model a300 spectrometer and the electron spin resonance esr spectra were obtained meanwhile the surface defects of the powders were also recorded by the esr spectra the quenching experimental steps were as follow 0 5 g of the powders from the models were added into the glass beakers containing 20 ml simulated wastewater cl concentration was 500 mg l and 1 mm p benzoquinone bq ammonium oxalate ao and isopropanol ipa were added to quench the o2 radicals holes h and oh radicals respectively meanwhile 2 mm tert butyl alcohol tba was also used to simultaneously quench the oh and cl radicals 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the calcination temperatures the calcination temperature is important to ensure the sufficient carbonization but maintain the model shape as much as possible the optical images of the bi pcms after calcination at different temperatures for 30 min were shown in fig 4 a e at the temperature of 100 c the milky white color of the bi no3 3 5h2o resin model changed to yellow fig 4a which was then turned into brown at 200 c fig 4b as the temperature increased to 300 c the dark color was present for the bi pcms fig 4c it is noted that although the model shape is saved completely the whole model seems not to be completely carbonized fig 4d showed the optical image of the bi pcms calcinated at the higher temperature of 400 c and a little expansion was exhibited for them due to the sufficient carbonization but the model shape was still maintained further increasing the temperature to 500 c the models collapsed seriously fig 4e the xrd patterns of these bi pcms were shown in fig 5 a at the calcination temperatures of 100 and 200 c there were no obvious diffraction peaks and the broad peak at about 2Î¸ 20o was originated from the amorphous carbon chen et al 2017 shin et al 2014 differently in the bi pcm obtained at 300 c obvious diffraction peaks appeared and all of them were assigned to the metallic bi0 phase jcpds card no 85 1329 when the temperature increased to 400 c in addition to the bi0 phase some strong diffraction peaks of bi2o3 jcpds card no 78 1793 were present in the case of 500 c the bi0 phase was not detected and only the diffraction peaks of bi2o3 appeared the amorphous carbon related broad diffraction peak was maintained in the bi pcms obtained at 100 300 c when the temperature reached 400 c the broad diffraction peak was largely weakened meaning the amount of carbon in the resin model was suitably reduced to ensure the sufficient carbonization but maintain the model shape at 500 c the amorphous carbon related broad diffraction peak disappeared completely leading to the destruction of the resin models as a result according to the entire appearances of the bi pcms obtained at different temperatures 400 c was chosen as the optimum calcination temperature under the calcination temperature of 400 c different calcination times were investigated over the resin models with the larger length diameter ratio same composition than those mentioned above as shown in fig 4f j at the calcination times of 10 20 and 30 min the bi pcms maintained most of the features of the initial models when the calcination time increased to 40 min the model begun to collapse and the collapse phenomenon was more obvious at the calcination time of 60 min the xrd patterns of the bi pcms at the calcination times of 10 20 and 30 min were shown in fig 5b the characteristics of the diffraction peaks at 10 and 20 min were basically the same and most of them were attributed to the bi0 phase while those of bi2o3 were very weak in the xrd pattern obtained by 30 min calcination there were not only the stronger diffraction peaks of bi0 but also the strong diffraction peaks of bi2o3 which can be used as the chloride removal agent because the cl removal performance is mainly originated from bi2o3 rather than bi0 however the presence of bi0 may enhance the chloride removal efficiency since the lspr can be generated on the bi0 nanoparticles so there will be a synergistic effect between the crystal phases of bi0 and bi2o3 in the bi pcms the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the bi pcms were given in fig 5c where all of them were ascribed to type iv with the h2 hysteresis loop wang et al 2015 meaning there was the mesoporous structure property for the bi pcms the pore size distributions of the bi pcms calcined for 10 20 and 30 min were provided in fig 5d and the average pore sizes were 3 038 4 879 and 1 795 nm table s2 respectively the bet specific surface area of the bi pcm calcined at 30 min reached 40 m2 g table s2 which was slightly larger than those obtained at the calcination times of 10 29 m2 g and 20 min 33 m2 g compared with other calcination times the bi pcm at 30 min has the advantages in micropore size and specific surface area which can accommodate more bi0 nanoparticles and prevent their loss due to the adhesion force of the porous carbon therefore the bi pcm sample calcined for 30 min was chosen for the cl removal experiments 3 2 cl removal performance over one single bi pcm to evaluate the cl removal performance one single bi pcm was put into 50 ml simulated wastewater with the cl concentration of 500 mg l the ph effect on the cl removal performance was first investigated under the dark condition as shown in fig s2 the cl concentrations decreased to 441 474 480 and 498 mg l at the initial ph values of 1 2 3 and 5 respectively and the corresponding chloride removal efficiencies of 11 8 5 3 3 9 and 0 4 were obtained according to the bi2o3 based cl removal method the formation of biocl can be seen in eq 1 dou et al 2019 huang et al 2020 wu et al 2022 1 b i 2 o 3 2 h 2 c l 2 biocl h 2 o where the h ions are needed to dissolve bi2o3 and release bi3 ions at the initial ph values of 3 and 5 the removed capacities of cl ions were very small because there were not enough h ions to drive the cl removal reaction and the terminal ph even increased to 3 45 and 5 09 respectively fig s2 when the initial ph values were reduced to 2 and 1 although their terminal values also increased to 2 27 and 1 32 respectively higher chloride removal efficiencies were obtained and the latter was about twice as much as the former indicating the higher content of h ions was conducive to the improvement of cl removal performance however further reducing the ph would increase the cost and the dissolution of the bi related crystal phases so the ph 1 was selected as the optimum condition it is noted that the cl removal capacity is related to the amount of bi2o3 exposed on the porous surface of bi pcm although the removal efficiency of 11 8 at ph 1 was low fig 6 a the utilization efficiency of bi2o3 on bi pcm might have already reached the maximum the resultant pcm was taken out and dried fig 6b and many white precipitates were adsorbed on the surface these white precipitates were actually attributed to the cl removal product of biocl dou et al 2019 huang et al 2020 li et al 2021 wu et al 2022 which was marked as biocl pcm the traditional bi2o3 method needs to recover the biocl powder after the cl removal by contrast this experiment avoids the trouble of centrifugal separation of the biocl powder where the biocl can be tightly attached on the porous surface of the pcm which facilitates the next steps of wet regeneration and the cl removal cycles the cleavage of cl in the single biocl pcm was then performed by using naoh to obtain the regenerated bi pcm fig 6c and the color of the particles adhered to the surface of the black pcm was changed from white to yellow these yellow particles were assigned to bi2o3 dou et al 2019 huang et al 2020 li et al 2021 wu et al 2022 which did not fall off during the wet regeneration process in the second and third cycles over the regenerated bi pcm the cl concentrations respectively decreased to 447 and 446 mg l which were almost the same as that obtained from the first cycle however the lower cl concentrations of 382 and 396 mg l were achieved in the fourth and fifth cycles and the chloride removal efficiencies reached 23 6 and 20 8 respectively because the cl removal capacity is tightly associated with the exposure of bi2o3 after the repeated use of the bi pcm more bi2o3 particles were exposed through stripping off the carbon covered on the surface of the bi0 bi2o3 particles indeed we could see from fig 4h that the surface of the initial bi pcm was covered by the black carbon or other impurities produced from the pyrolysis carbonization of the resin model fig 6d and the yellow color of bi2o3 was not obvious after the first cycle of cl removal the white colored biocl was obvious on the pcm as the cycles increased more and more chloride removal agents of bi0 bi2o3 were exposed on the regenerated bi pcm leading to the increment of the chloride removal efficiency 3 3 cl removal performance over multiple bi pcms since the chloride removal efficiency over one single bi pcm was very limited to maximize the advantage of the bi pcm the cl removal experiment over the system with multiple bi pcms was designed wherein the size of the bi pcms used was the largest among the prepared models same composition as shown in fig 7 a 2 l simulated wastewater containing 500 mg l of cl ions was passed through the quartz tube containing seven bi pcms under the conditions of dark environment ph 1 and reaction time of 5 h a terminal cl concentration of 386 mg l was obtained fig s3 and the corresponding chloride removal efficiency of 22 9 was higher than that 10 0 at ph 2 accordingly the condition of ph 1 was selected for the cycling experiments it could be seen from fig 7b that as the cycles extended the chloride removal efficiencies were stable and on the fourth and fifth cycles the slightly higher values of 26 6 and 25 7 were achieved respectively although the chloride removal efficiency increased compared with that over one single bi pcm the cl capacity removed in the total wastewater was still not enough both of bi2o3 and biocl are the excellent photocatalysts sayed et al 2022 and considering the holes and active free radicals with strong oxidative properties generated on them may improve the chloride removal efficiency the uv light driven experiment was designed and shown in fig 7c at the first cycle the concentration of cl ions in the wastewater significantly decreased to 306 mg l fig s3 and a high chloride removal efficiency of 38 8 was achieved which was still higher than that 21 8 at ph 2 meanwhile the increments of their terminal ph values were also larger than those in the dark meaning more h ions had been consumed in the light irradiation condition it is worth to point out that from the second cycle the chloride removal efficiencies even increased to 55 60 and in the fifth cycle a highest value of 63 6 was present which was about 2 3 times that in the dark fig 7e showed the optical image of the initial multiple bi pcms in the quartz tube where the yellow color of bi2o3 was not obvious due to the coverage by the black porous carbon after 5 h of uv light irradiation a large number of white precipitates appeared on the surface of the pcms fig 7f and the biocl pcms were obtained in the regeneration process the naoh solution 2 mol l was pumped into the quartz tube and the biocl pcms were immersed for the cleavage of cl ions the optical image of the regenerated bi pcms after the fourth cycle of naoh treatment was given in fig 7g and the yellow color was present on the surface of the pcms which was originated from the bi2o3 converted from the cleavage of cl in biocl importantly after four cycles the bi2o3 particles were still tightly attached to the porous surface of the pcms the concentration of bi3 ions in the wastewater after the first cycle was detected by icp oes to be 3 388 mg l but after the fifth cycles the bi3 ions were undetectable indicating the bi related crystal phases were very stable by the adherence of the porous carbon which ensured the effective cl removal performance of the bi pcms 3 4 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of the pcms before and after cl removal were shown in fig 8 the initial bi pcm possessed two crystal phases of bi0 jcpds card no 85 1329 and bi2o3 jcpds card no 78 1793 after the cl removal a new phase of biocl jcpds card no 85 0861 obviously appeared in the resultant biocl pcm meanwhile there was a certain amount of bi2o3 left in the biocl pcm which was attributed to the unreacted bi2o3 in the bi0 bi2o3 biocl structure or in the inner part of pcm since the powder for xrd detection was selected from the partial biocl pcm including the surface bi0 biocl and inner bi0 bi2o3 in the wet regeneration process the cleavage of cl in biocl was realized by naoh treatment and even after the fourth cycle the residual cl content could still be controlled in a very low level because there were almost no biocl related diffraction peaks in the regenerated bi pcm indicating most of biocl had been converted into bi2o3 3 5 morphologies and microstructures the morphology of the initial bi pcm was first observed by sem and there were abundant 3d porous structures in the cross section fig 9 a which were consisted of many ligaments and hierarchical pores with different sizes fig 9b was an enlarged view of fig 9a and it could be observed that many nanoparticles were distributed on the surface of the pores to confirm their compositions the sem eds characterization was performed and the elemental mapping results of bi o and c were given in fig 9c d and e respectively it could be found that the c was used to keep the 3d skeleton whose ligaments were mainly loaded with bi and o elements on the inner surface of the hierarchical pores small contents of bi and o were also detected but the signal of bi seemed to be relatively stronger than that of o fig 9f according to the element contents listed in table s3 the entire atomic ratio of bi o c was detected to be 1 21 75 102 25 the c was mainly originated from porous carbon material while the o content was much higher than the theoretical value of bi2o3 which might be originated from the incomplete carbonized resin the microstructure of the initial bi pcm was further studied by tem as shown in fig 9g there were many black nano spherical particles tightly imbedded in the porous carbon fragments the size range of these nano spherical particles was approximately 11 102 nm with an average size of 43 nm fig s4a the enlarged image was shown in fig 9h and the core shell structure clearly appeared for almost all the spherical particles fig 9i was the high resolution tem hrtem image of a nano spherical particle with core and shell sizes of 26 and 6 nm respectively the fast fourier transform fft pattern selected from the core contained the 012 planes of bi0 and that from the shell included the 220 planes of bi2o3 indicating a core shell structure of bi0 bi2o3 was formed for the nano spherical particles whose bi2o3 was generated from the surface oxidation of bi0 the sem morphologies of the biocl pcm were provided in fig 10 a and b and many particles were distributed on the porous surface of the cross section to confirm the composition of these particles their sem eds mappings were tested it could be found that throughout the cross section of biocl pcm fig 10a the elements of bi fig 10c o fig 10d and cl fig 10e were distributed on the particles fig 10a and the geometrical profile of the remaining pores was still clear the c element was distributed around the 3d skeleton fig 10f which was taken as the substrate to load the bi o and cl elements fig 10g and adsorb them to avoid their loss in the cl removal and regeneration process the atomic ratio of bi o c cl was calculated to be 1 20 1 78 2 0 7 table s3 and the high content of cl meant a large part of bi2o3 had been converted to biocl the tem image of the biocl pcm was shown in fig 10h and in the porous carbon fragments there were also embedded with many black nano spherical particles and their size range was 17 170 nm with an average size of 65 nm fig s4b which was higher than that 43 nm in the initial bi pcm indicating the whole size of the spherical particles increased after cl removal the hrtem image of one spherical particle with size of 58 nm was shown in fig 10i which was tightly embedded into the porous carbon meanwhile there were clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0 75 nm in the area of the nano sheets fig s5 whose fft pattern contained the 001 planes of biocl suggesting that there were very thin biocl nano sheets distributed on bi0 bi2o3 to form the bi0 bi2o3 biocl nanoparticles 3 6 xps analysis xps detection was performed to investigate the surface compositions of bi pcm and biocl pcm as shown in their survey scan xps spectra fig s6 there were the main elements of bi o and c contained in the initial bi pcm and after the cl removal the additional element of cl included in the biocl pcm meanwhile in the pcms a small peak attributing the element of n appeared which might be caused by the incomplete carbonized resin fig 11 a showed the high resolution xps spectra of bi 4f wherein the peaks of bi pcm at 164 9 and 159 6 ev were attributed to the bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 of bi2o3 respectively and the weaker peaks at 160 6 and 157 2 ev were generated by the metallic bi0 wang et al 2021 after the cl removal due to the production of biocl the bi 4f peaks of biocl pcm were slightly shifted notably the weak signal of bi0 in bi pcm was caused by the thick shells of bi2o3 on the bi0 cores differently the bi 4f signal of biocl pcm was much stronger than that of bi pcm suggesting the exposure of the bi related phases was more obvious after the stripping of some carbon materials which was consistent with the optical images present in figs 6 and 7 fig 11b showed the o 1s spectra and three peaks could be fitted the peaks of bi pcm at 530 6 531 8 and 533 4 ev were ascribed to the lattice oxygen oxygen vacancies and the adsorbed h2o or oh groups park et al 2018 respectively whose positions were then slightly shifted to higher values for biocl pcm the c 1s spectra in fig 11c could also be fitted into three peaks at 288 9 286 2 and 284 8 ev for bi pcm and biocl pcm the peak at 284 8 ev mainly corresponded to the c c groups of the amorphous carbon and those at 286 2 and 288 9 ev were respectively assigned to the c o and c o groups which were originated by the incomplete carbonized resin or the adsorbed co2 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the cl 2p spectrum of biocl pcm was given in fig 11d and the two fitted peaks at 200 1 and 198 5 ev were ascribed to cl 2p1 2 and cl 2p3 2 of biocl respectively indicating the adsorption of cl by the porous carbon could be negligible the element contents obtained by xps were listed in table s3 and based on the bi cl atomic ratio of 1 1 8 the higher cl content compared with that bi cl 1 0 7 obtained by sem eds meant that most of the cl removal products of biocl were located on the surface of biocl pcm to form the bi0 bi2o3 biocl structure 3 7 cl removal mechanism the light driven experiments showed the chloride removal efficiency was improved about 2 3 times that under the dark condition which was associated with the light response performance of the bi related phases such as bi0 bi2o3 and biocl it is noted that under uv light irradiation the lspr effect of the metallic bi0 nanoparticles can be excited and based on the semiconductors of bi2o3 and biocl the active species such as the o2 and oh radicals and holes h with strong oxidation properties can also be generated 3 7 1 light absorption property to investigate the light absorption properties of the initial bi pcm biocl pcm and the regenerated bi pcm samples their uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra were tested and shown in fig 12 a due to the presence of the porous carbon all the three samples had a broadband light absorption range which extended to the near infrared light region for the short wavelength absorption including uv light was mainly contributed by the semiconductors of bi2o3 and biocl notably biocl pcm possessed two relatively strong absorption peaks at 268 and 312 nm which should be originated from the lspr effect of bi0 dong et al 2014 toudert et al 2012 because the whole particle size of the spherical particles consisting of bi0 bi2o3 biocl was distributed in the wide range of 17 170 nm fig s4b as for the initial bi pcm and the regenerated bi pcm only the weak plasmonic peaks were present due to the barrier coatings of the porous carbon or the bi2o3 which was consistent with their surface appearances fig 6b d and 7e g and the peak intensities in the bi 4f xps spectra fig 11a 3 7 2 oxygen vacancy in the carbonization process the formation of bi0 consumed carbon or carbon monoxide co which could be seen in eqs 2 and 3 wang et al 2021 respectively 2 b i 2 o 3 3 c 2 b i 0 3 co 3 b i 2 o 3 3 co 2 b i 0 3 c o 2 on a basis of the formed bi0 nanoparticles the bi2o3 was generated by the surface oxidation of bi0 eq 4 and then the core shell structure of bi0 bi2o3 could be obtained 4 4 b i 0 3 o 2 2 b i 2 o 3 it is conceivable that some surface defects such as oxygen vacancies are probably formed in the carbonization process which may strongly affect the chemical and electronic structures of the pcm samples so their esr spectra were tested and shown in 12b all the three samples had the symmetrical esr signal peaks at g 2 0002 corresponding to the single electron oxygen vacancy li et al 2017 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 among them the initial bi pcm had the strongest signal suggesting its oxygen vacancy content was the highest after the cl removal the oxygen vacancy signal decreased in biocl pcm and in the regenerated bi pcm the lower signal was further detected which should be caused by the recrystallization in the phase transformation of bi2o3 to biocl and to bi2o3 again however it could be inferred that the oxygen vacancies were mainly present in the bi related phases such as bi2o3 and biocl rather than in the porous carbon since there was no significant change for the porous carbon in the cl removal and regeneration processes furthermore even after four cycles there was still a part of oxygen vacancies contained in the regenerated bi pcm to assist the electron hole pair separation and then enhance the generation of active free radicals 3 7 3 active species to test whether there were the active free radicals produced in the cl removal process the esr dmpo capture experiments of the oh and o2 radicals were performed under uv light irradiation the esr spectra of the dmpo oh signals over the initial bi pcm biocl pcm and the regenerated bi pcm were provided in fig 12c at the reaction times of 10 and 15 min the four line esr peaks related to the oh radicals were detected with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 but the signal intensity of biocl pcm was more obvious than those of the other two samples when capturing the o2 radicals fig 12d the related six characteristic peaks were measured with similar strength while biocl pcm still had higher productivity than those of other samples accordingly it could be indicated that the cl removal product of biocl in the bi0 bi2o3 system was conducive to the production of the oh and o2 radicals however in terms of the dmpo oh and dmpo o2 signal intensities fig 12c and d the production ability of o2 was higher than that of oh indicating the o2 radicals might be more important for the improved chloride removal efficiency of bi pcm to verify this conjecture the trapping experiments over the powders collected from the pcms were carried out wherein the oh o2 and hole h were quenched by the ipa bq and ao scavengers respectively and oh cl were quenched by tba as shown in fig 13 a in the absence of the scavengers the initial cl concentration of 500 mg l decreased to 440 mg l after reaction of 2 h with the introduction of ipa bq ao and tba the terminal cl concentrations were 460 476 471 and 464 mg l respectively indicating the inhibition effect of o2 for the removal of cl ions was the highest followed by the h with the quenching of oh there was a certain decrease of the chloride removal efficiency as for the cl only a weak interference was exhibited which might be caused by its high conversion rate to biocl dou et al 2019 wu et al 2022 as a result the suppression of the cl removal was in the order of o2 h oh cl meaning the improved chloride removal efficiency under uv light irradiation was originated from these active species generated 3 7 4 photocorrosion by holes to interpret the generation of the active species of oh o2 h and cl the electronic structures of the bi related crystal phases in the pcm samples were illustrated the valence band vb xps spectra of the initial bi pcm biocl pcm and the regenerated bi pcm were shown in fig 13b c and d respectively and their vb edge positions were calculated to be 3 5 2 4 and 2 8 ev lower than their fermi energy bands which exhibited blueshift from the transformation of bi2o3 biocl the regenerated bi2o3 there were two crystal phases of bi0 and bi2o3 in the initial bi pcm under uv light irradiation the excitation wavelength of 253 7 nm was close to one plasmonic peak 268 nm of the bi0 nanoparticles fig 12a so the light energy could be sufficiently absorbed to generate hot electrons e and holes h since the fermi level 0 17 ev of bi0 is more negative than the conduction band cb edge 0 4 ev of bi2o3 dong et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the hot electrons were transferred to the cb of bi2o3 fig 14 which then moved to the porous carbon to produce the o2 radicals gao et al 2016 due to the transfer of electrons hot holes were left on the surface of bi0 or its interface with bi2o3 coating so the photocorrosion could be easily occurred burleigh et al 2003 wherein the surface bi0 might be oxidized by holes to release bi3 ions eq 5 5 b i 0 3 h b i 3 meanwhile the bi2o3 on the contact interface internal surface with bi0 and that on the outer surface of the bi2o3 coating could also be photo corroded fig 14 it was reported that a trapped hole on the surface could generate an o s u r f a c e through its reaction with the surface oxygen ion o s u r f a c e 2 eq 6 which was weakly bonded to the crystal lattice of bi2o3 and its local position could be changed dou et al 2021 gerischer 1966 when a second hole was trapped by the neighboring o s u r f a c e 2 another o s u r f a c e was generated to form the ionic group of o o 2 eq 7 with two remaining weak bonds attached to the crystal lattice subsequently the o o 2 could quickly react with another two holes to produce an o2 eq 8 and two electrons were left in the original crystal lattice which was unstable and easily to release bi3 ions into the solution the total reaction for the dissolution of bi2o3 by holes was expressed in eq 9 as a result the photocorrosion of bi0 and bi2o3 was realized to assist the release of bi3 ions in the acidic solution which were easily reacted with the cl ions to form biocl eq 1 6 o s u r f a c e 2 h o s u r f a c e 7 o s u r f a c e h o s u r f a c e 2 o o 2 8 o o 2 2 h o 2 9 2 b i 2 o 3 12 h 4 b i 3 3 o 2 3 7 5 oxidation of cl to cl as for the bi2o3 coating because of its higher cb edge 0 4 ev than the potential 0 33 ev of o2 o2 wu et al 2019 its photogenerated electrons could not react with o2 to produce o2 and instead they would transfer to the porous carbon fig 14 then the holes left on the vb vb edge 3 2 ev of bi2o3 huang et al 2020 and they would not only cause the photocorrosion of bi2o3 but also react with h2o to generate oh eq 10 or directly oxidize cl to form cl eq 11 since the wastewater was at acidic ph ph 1 there were enough h ions to react with oh to produce cl eq 12 subsequently these resultant cl radicals could directly react with bi2o3 to produce biocl with the participants of the hot electrons and h ions eq 13 dou et al 2019 wu et al 2022 so the cl removal process was accelerated it is noted that due to this fast conversion of cl into biocl dou et al 2019 wu et al 2022 the esr signal of cl is difficult to detect and although its inhibition effect of cl removal is not obvious compared with those of o2 and oh fig 13a its important role should not be ignored 10 h h 2 o oh h 11 h c l c l 12 oh c l h c l h 2 o 13 2 c l b i 2 o 3 2 e 2 h 2 biocl h 2 o 3 7 6 o2 radicals according to the radical trapping experiments the o2 played an important role for the cl removal one possible explanation was that fig 14 in the acidic wastewater ph 1 o2 was easily reacted with h to generate an intermediate h2o2 eq 14 which was then converted to oh after accepting electrons eq 15 hirakawa and nosaka 2002 wang et al 2022 when the oh radicals were formed more cl radicals would be produced to enhance the formation of biocl meanwhile if two cl radicals were combined the cl2 gas would be formed eq 16 peng et al 2019 and then the hocl was easily produced from the reaction between cl2 and h2o eq 17 which would inhibit the cl removal reaction however o2 was able to activate the hocl to produce oh and to release cl eq 18 cheng et al 2021 cheng et al 2020 so the chloride removal efficiency could be improved 14 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 15 h 2 o 2 e oh o h 16 c l c l c l 2 17 c l 2 h 2 o hocl hcl 18 hocl o 2 oh c l o 2 3 7 7 important role of biocl after the cl removal under uv light irradiation the biocl pcm was obtained and the energy band diagram of its heterostructures was shown in the bottom side of fig 14 the fermi level 0 17 ev of bi0 was more positive than the cb edge 1 0 ev of biocl huang et al 2020 so the uv excited electrons on the cb of biocl were transferred to the electron band of bi0 and then transferred to the porous carbon to produce o2 since there was bi2o3 remained in biocl pcm the electrons could also indirectly move to the cb of bi2o3 before reaching the porous carbon the bi0 nanoparticles could be taken as the electron sinks and the electron hole pair recombination could be greatly suppressed meanwhile the lspr effect of the bi0 nanoparticles was still present and not only the hot electrons were produced but a partial electromagnetic field around them could be formed to further accelerate the electron hole pair separation as a result there were abundant electrons transferred to the porous carbon to generate the o2 radicals which could be demonstrated from the strongest signals in the esr dmpo capture results fig 12d after the transfer of electrons more holes were remained on the vb of biocl which could directly oxidize cl to cl because the vb edge 2 4 ev of biocl was approximately equal to the potential 2 4 ev of h2o oh wu et al 2019 the oh could also be formed to convert cl to cl to enhance the chloride removal efficiency it is noted that in the biocl pcm sample its surface is almost covered by biocl and the amount of bi2o3 is largely reduced so the contribution of bi2o3 to the yields of oh and o2 is very limited furthermore from the stronger oh and o2 signals of biocl pcm than those of bi pcm it can be inferred that the formation of biocl is conducive to the generation of active species in the cl removal process according to the above discussion the chloride removal efficiency was greatly improved with uv light irradiation and the related mechanism could be explained as follow 1 the hot holes generated from the lspr of bi0 and those left in the vb of bi2o3 caused photocorrosion to them and more bi3 ions could be released to react with cl ions to form biocl 2 the holes could directly oxidize the cl ions to produce the cl radicals 3 the oh radicals could be formed by the reaction between holes and h2o which were then converted to the cl radicals by their oxidation of cl ions 4 the cl radicals could be directly reacted with bi2o3 to form biocl 5 in the acidic condition the o2 could be converted to oh and then to cl and 6 the cl2 gas was easily formed by the combination of cl radicals and the hocl would be generated to inhibit the cl removal reaction but the o2 could react with hocl to form cl and oh on a basis of these advantages the high light response chloride removal efficiency can be obtained over the bi pcms 3 8 cl removal performance in real wastewater to further investigate the actual cl removal performance of bi pcms the desulfurization wastewater with cl concentration of 3191 mg l and ph of 2 54 was selected and before its pump into the quartz tube with fresh multiple bi pcms the ph was adjusted to 1 it is noted that the desulfurization wastewater generated in the limestone gypsum desulfurization process is not scared of sulfate and other salts but its biggest problem is attributed to the high concentration of cl ions which will cause serious corrosion to the equipment if the cl concentration can be largely reduced the desulfurization wastewater will be reused to avoid the costly treatment methods and the consumption of fresh water according to the light enhanced cl removal experiment in the simulated wastewater over the multiple bi pcms fig 7d the removal amount of cl was about 600 mg 500 mg l 60 2 l when the removal efficiency was 60 in one cycle 1 l of the desulfurization wastewater was pumped through the quartz tube containing the multiple bi pcms and there was about 3191 mg of cl ions which needed about five cycles to decrease the cl concentration as shown in fig 15 a in the dark condition after five cycles the cl concentration in the wastewater was reduced from 3191 to 2253 mg l and a total chloride removal efficiency of 29 4 was obtained under the uv light irradiation the cl concentration largely decreased from 3191 to 366 mg l and the chloride removal efficiency reached 88 5 fig 15b by comparison an improvement of about 3 times was obtained with the uv light irradiation which was contributed by the generated hot holes and the oh o2 and cl radicals the optical image of the regenerated bi pcms after the fourth cycle of alkaline treatment was shown in fig 15c and the bi2o3 related yellow color on the surface could be obviously observed when the fifth cycle of cl removal was finished the biocl related white color on the surface of biocl pcm could still be found in the real wastewater there are often other impurity ions such as so4 2 no3 al3 fe3 zn2 cu2 mg2 and ca2 and their individual effect on the cl removal with uv light irradiation was provided in fig s7 in comparison with the blank group the impurity ions of so4 2 no3 al3 zn2 mg2 and ca2 only had a slight effect on the removal of cl ions however in the presence of cu2 and fe3 ions the cl concentrations decreased from the initial 500 to 369 and 395 mg l respectively which were much lower than that 440 mg l of the blank group exhibiting their promotion effect for the cl removal it is conceivable that the cucl precipitate may be generated from the reduction reaction of cu2 ions caused by the electrons generated with uv light irradiation peng et al 2019 for the fe3 ions the photo fenton reaction may be occurred to enhance the generation of active oxygen radicals miralles cuevas et al 2021 and the cl removal performance can thus be improved it is noted that in the desulfurization wastewater there are also the impurity ions such as no3 al3 zn2 mg2 and ca2 table s1 but the chloride removal efficiency of bi pcm was not influenced by these co existing ions indicating the good selectivity of cl ions by the bi based chloride removal agents therefore the bi pcms constructed has a great application prospect in the removal of cl ions from wastewater 4 conclusion to obtain a cl removal technology that is both environmentally friendly and cost saving the 3d printing technology combined with the bi2o3 method is developed the bi containing precursor was mixed into the photosensitive resin and through a high temperature carbonization process the bi pcm was obtained wherein the bi0 bi2o3 core shell nanoparticles were tightly attached on the surface of the hierarchical porous carbon in the dark condition after five cycles of cl removal the chloride removal efficiencies over one single bi pcm and the multiple bi pcms were about 20 8 and 25 7 respectively upon the uv light irradiation the chloride removal efficiency over the multiple bi pcms increased to 63 6 at the fifth cycle which even reached 89 in the treatment of desulfurization wastewater the light enhanced cl removal performance of bi pcm was contributed by the photocorrosion of bi0 and bi2o3 which was caused by the holes generated from the lspr effect of bi0 and the heterostructures and more bi3 ions were released to participate into the cl removal process the holes and active free radicals of oh and o2 were also able to convert cl into cl which directly reacted with bi2o3 to form biocl the bi pcms not only have high light response chloride removal efficiency but also can be easily regenerated with alkaline solution exhibiting a promising application prospect in the cl removal from wastewater supplementary material additional information about the cl removal setup the cl removal efficiencies at

15454,the bismuth oxide bi2o3 based chloride cl removal method is one of the chemical precipitation methods possessing good selectivity and high removal efficiency of cl ions but bi2o3 often appears in the powder form which is difficult to be recovered for regeneration in this work the combination of 3d printing technology and the bi2o3 method was explored to construct the resin model including the bi precursors in the optimum carbonization process at 400 c for 30 min the bi3 ions of the bi precursor were reduced into the metallic bi0 nanoparticles whose surfaces were covered by the thin bi2o3 layers to form the heterostructured bi0 bi2o3 core shell nanoparticles with an average size of 43 nm these bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles were tightly adhered to the internal and external surfaces of the hierarchical porous carbon model bi pcm which greatly facilitated their regeneration and ensured the stable cl removal performance after five cycles of cl removal the chloride removal efficiency over the multiple bi pcms in the dark and ph 1 conditions maintained at about 26 which then largely increased to 63 6 with uv light irradiation the light enhanced mechanism was related to the improved release rate of bi3 ions caused by photocorrosion and the cl radicals produced from the holes and the oh and o2 radicals which quickly reacted with bi2o3 to form biocl the construction of bi pcms by using 3d printing technology provides a very promising strategy for the removal of cl ions from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 3d printing bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles chloride removal efficiency photocorrosion active free radicals data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years whether the wastewater generated in industrial production activities or landfill leachate generated in daily life both contain high concentrations of chloride cl ions cao et al 2022 if appropriate treatment is not taken the cl ions will cause great environmental harm and economic loss such as the corrosivity towards metallic facilities the salinization of fresh water and soil the inhibition of crop growth the formation of chlorine related carcinogens and the robbery of active radicals to decrease the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants huang et al 2020 li et al 2022 the cl removal methods of chemical precipitation ion exchange electrochemistry membrane separation and evaporation have been mainly reported dou et al 2022 li et al 2022 sun et al 2021 xin et al 2020 but there are still some problems such as high operation cost and secondary pollution and most of them cannot be used in real wastewater treatment it is noted that among the chemical precipitation methods the bismuth oxide bi2o3 method has better selectivity and stability compared with those of the friedel s salt and cuprous chloride precipitation methods dou et al 2019 guo et al 2021 huang et al 2020 li et al 2021 sun et al 2020 wu et al 2022 the cl removal principle of bi2o3 is realized by the formation of bismuth oxychloride biocl but most of the bi2o3 materials used are present in the powder form dou et al 2022 li et al 2022 which are readily soluble in acid solution resulting in their large loss during the cl removal process if the bi2o3 powder can be tightly attached on a large substrate its stability will be greatly improved to reduce its loss and prolong the lifetime of cl removal to find a suitable substrate for the bi2o3 powder a porous model constructed by 3d printing may be a good option 3d printing is attributed to an additive manufacturing method that converts digital model files into physical object models chang et al 2019 rossi et al 2017 where the resin models can be produced by the liquid crystal display lcd technology kafle et al 2021 liu et al 2021 to realize the cl removal performance of the resin models the bi precursors can be included in the photosensitive resin through the lcd photocuring 3d printing technology the bi contained resin models are constructed and after a high temperature pyrolysis carbonization treatment the new porous models containing the bi based chloride removal agents can be obtained for the bi related phases in addition to bi2o3 there will be the metallic bi0 particles generated from the reduction reaction of bi3 ions in the carbonization process these bi0 particles have localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect to produce hot electrons and holes wang et al 2021 and the cl ions in wastewater can be oxidized by them to form the chlorine cl radicals which are conducive to improving the chloride removal efficiency researches showed that the particle size of bi2o3 was closely related to the cl removal performance especially for the size effect of quantum dots or two dimensional materials huang et al 2020 up to now the common bi2o3 materials used for cl removal have large particle sizes dou et al 2019 li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 and the cl removal product of biocl is easy to deposit on the surface of bi2o3 to prevent the further release of its inner bi3 ions resulting in the low utilization rate of bi3 and its excessive dosage added in the cl removal process however in the carbonization process of the bi contained resin model the bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles can be generated from the adhesion and dispersion properties of the porous carbon which have high activity for the cl removal as for the cl removal product of biocl they can be easily regenerated with an alkaline solution and then the resultant bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles can still tightly adhere to the porous carbon surface which are used as the chloride removal agents again importantly in the entire cl removal and regeneration process the loss of bi will be greatly reduced in this study the bi contained precursor powder was mixed with the liquid photosensitive resin and through the 3d printing and the subsequent pyrolysis carbonization the hierarchical porous carbon model loaded with bi0 bi2o3 nanoparticles bi pcm was obtained to determine the optimum preparation parameters various kinds of bi pcms were prepared under different carbonization temperatures and times by observing the shape retention the best bi pcm was obtained the removal experiments of cl ions in wastewater were first performed over one single bi pcm under the dark environment with different ph values and based on the optimum ph the uv light irradiation was introduced over the multiple bi pcms to investigate the cl removal performance the structure morphology and composition of the pcms before and after the cl removal experiments were studied and compared and the cl removal mechanism was discussed based on the photocorrosion and the active radicals the concentration of bi3 ions in wastewater after cl removal was tested and the shape of bi pcm was recorded to evaluate the stability performance finally the resultant product containing biocl biocl pcm was regenerated with naoh solution and its cyclic cl removal performance was tested 2 experimental methods 2 1 reagents and materials h2so4 98 ethanol bi no3 3 5h2o and naoh were obtained from shanghai lingfeng chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china acetone was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china nacl was obtained from qiangsheng functional chemical co ltd jiangsu china photosensitive resin uv curable polyurethane acrylate resin was obtained from guanghua weiye co ltd shenzhen china all the above reagents were of analytical reagent grade 2 2 preparation of the bi pcms 2 2 1 preparation of the 3d printed resin models 10 g bi no3 3 5h2o powder was weighed and ground thoroughly and then 12 ml acetone was added fig 1 a after ultrasonic dispersion for 2 min 100 ml photosensitive resin was added the resultant bi no3 3 5h2o resin mixture was stirred evenly with a glass rod and then was ultrasonically dispersed for 10 min in the dark it can be seen that the liquid photosensitive resin changed from transparent yellow to milky white after adding bi no3 3 5h2o indicating the bi no3 3 5h2o powder has been uniformly distributed in the resin after ultrasonic treatment pouring the mixed bi no3 3 5h2o resin into the resin hopper of the lcd light curing 3d printer creality ld 006 fig 1b the 3d printed digital models were designed as porous cylinders the printing parameters were set as follows the total exposure time for the bottom three layers was 90 s and that of each other layer was 3 s the uv light with a wavelength of 405 nm emitted by the light source was dispersed by the focusing lens and then was irradiated upward through the lcd screen and the bi no3 3 5h2o resin was cured layer by layer on the platform finally the resin models containing bi no3 3 5h2o with many pores and different sizes were formed in comparison with the pristine model fig 1c the details were completely retained and the accuracy of printing was not influenced by the added bi no3 3 5h2o meanwhile the transparency of the pristine model was changed to the milky white color of the bi no3 3 5h2o resin models with the same composition fig 1d f indicating the bi no3 3 5h2o powder was uniformly distributed in the resin after ultrasonic dispersion 2 2 2 carbonization of the 3d printed resin models the obtained 3d printed resin models were first washed with ethanol and distilled water and were dried naturally in a fume hood these dried 3d resin models were put into a crucible which was then placed in a muffle furnace for carbonization fig 1g for comparison five calcination temperatures of 100 200 300 400 and 500 c and different times were performed and then different bi pcms were obtained by comparing their appearance morphology and structural characteristics the optimum bi pcm was achieved fig 1h 2 3 cl removal performance 2 3 1 one single bi pcm 50 ml simulated wastewater containing 500 mg l of cl ions was obtained by using nacl and distilled water the ph of the wastewater was adjusted to 1 2 3 or 5 with the concentrated h2so4 one of the optimum bi pcm was added into the wastewater fig 2 which was stirred at 500 r min for 2 h in the dark and the concentration of cl ions was detected on a universal ion chromatograph oic 600 orion electronic technology co ltd beijing china when the cl removal reaction was finished the resultant biocl pcm was obtained and taken out after drying in an oven at 85 c the biocl pcm was directly put into 50 ml naoh solution 2 mol l for the cleavage of cl ions 200 r min 1 h and the bi pcm was formed again which was then taken out and rinsed with distilled water and placed in an oven at 80 c for drying this wet regenerated bi pcm continued to remove cl ions in the simulated wastewater and the removal experiments were terminated after five cycles 2 3 2 multiple bi pcms a cl removal system was designed fig 3 and fig s1 where seven bi pcms were put into a quartz tube one end of the quartz tube was connected to a peristaltic pump for water inflow and the other end was for water outlet 2 l simulated wastewater containing 500 mg l of cl ions ph 1 or 2 was prepared by using the peristaltic pump the wastewater was pumped into the quartz tube when the quartz tube was filled with wastewater a low pumping speed was set during 5 h of cl removal reaction in the dark or uv 253 7 nm light irradiation condition room temperature all the 2 l wastewater could be passed through the quartz tube and 10 ml of the final wastewater was taken out for detection when the wastewater in the quartz tube was emptied out the naoh solution 2 mol l was pumped and filled the cleavage of cl ions of biocl pcms was completed after 2 h of storage when the naoh solution was emptied out the wet regenerated bi pcms were obtained which were reused to remove cl ions in the fresh 2 l simulated wastewater the initial ph of the wastewater in the quartz tube was adjusted to 1 by adding some h2so4 since the residual amount of naoh in the regenerated bi pcms was very small after the first cycle removal of cl ions the biocl pcms were regenerated and reused and five cycles were performed to further investigate the cl removal performance of the bi pcms a real desulfurization wastewater table s1 with cl concentration of 3191 mg l and initial ph of 2 54 ph was adjusted to 1 was chosen and the five cycles of removal experiments were performed as mentioned above 2 4 characterizations the crystal phases of the samples before and after cl removal and wet regeneration were tested on an x ray diffractometer xrd philips x pert powder diffractometer the morphology and element distribution of the samples were measured by using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss sigma 500 and its own energy dispersive spectrometer eds and before analysis the samples were pretreated by gold spraying the microstructures were also observed by a transmission electron microscope tem philips tecnai g2 f30 and the high resolution tem hrtem images were analyzed by the digital micrograph software the surface chemical states of the samples were measured on the thermo scientific k alpha x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps system which was operated in the constant analyser energy cae mode and the c 1s peak at 284 8 ev was used as a reference to calibrate the positions of other peaks the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the samples were tested at 77 k by using the quantachrome autosorb iq 2mp analyser system an icap6300 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo electron corp was used to detect the concentration of bi3 ions in the wastewater after cl removal 2 5 active free radical capture and quenching in the cl removal process the oh and o2 radicals generated on bi pcm biocl pcm and the regenerated bi pcm were detected by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo a part of the models was taken and ground into powders for each capture experiment 15 mg of the solid powder sample and 10 Âµl dmpo were added into a 3 ml glass bottle including a small rotor and then 1 ml distilled water for oh or methanol for o2 was added upon uv light irradiation for 10 min the resultant solutions after centrifugation were detected on a bruker model a300 spectrometer and the electron spin resonance esr spectra were obtained meanwhile the surface defects of the powders were also recorded by the esr spectra the quenching experimental steps were as follow 0 5 g of the powders from the models were added into the glass beakers containing 20 ml simulated wastewater cl concentration was 500 mg l and 1 mm p benzoquinone bq ammonium oxalate ao and isopropanol ipa were added to quench the o2 radicals holes h and oh radicals respectively meanwhile 2 mm tert butyl alcohol tba was also used to simultaneously quench the oh and cl radicals 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the calcination temperatures the calcination temperature is important to ensure the sufficient carbonization but maintain the model shape as much as possible the optical images of the bi pcms after calcination at different temperatures for 30 min were shown in fig 4 a e at the temperature of 100 c the milky white color of the bi no3 3 5h2o resin model changed to yellow fig 4a which was then turned into brown at 200 c fig 4b as the temperature increased to 300 c the dark color was present for the bi pcms fig 4c it is noted that although the model shape is saved completely the whole model seems not to be completely carbonized fig 4d showed the optical image of the bi pcms calcinated at the higher temperature of 400 c and a little expansion was exhibited for them due to the sufficient carbonization but the model shape was still maintained further increasing the temperature to 500 c the models collapsed seriously fig 4e the xrd patterns of these bi pcms were shown in fig 5 a at the calcination temperatures of 100 and 200 c there were no obvious diffraction peaks and the broad peak at about 2Î¸ 20o was originated from the amorphous carbon chen et al 2017 shin et al 2014 differently in the bi pcm obtained at 300 c obvious diffraction peaks appeared and all of them were assigned to the metallic bi0 phase jcpds card no 85 1329 when the temperature increased to 400 c in addition to the bi0 phase some strong diffraction peaks of bi2o3 jcpds card no 78 1793 were present in the case of 500 c the bi0 phase was not detected and only the diffraction peaks of bi2o3 appeared the amorphous carbon related broad diffraction peak was maintained in the bi pcms obtained at 100 300 c when the temperature reached 400 c the broad diffraction peak was largely weakened meaning the amount of carbon in the resin model was suitably reduced to ensure the sufficient carbonization but maintain the model shape at 500 c the amorphous carbon related broad diffraction peak disappeared completely leading to the destruction of the resin models as a result according to the entire appearances of the bi pcms obtained at different temperatures 400 c was chosen as the optimum calcination temperature under the calcination temperature of 400 c different calcination times were investigated over the resin models with the larger length diameter ratio same composition than those mentioned above as shown in fig 4f j at the calcination times of 10 20 and 30 min the bi pcms maintained most of the features of the initial models when the calcination time increased to 40 min the model begun to collapse and the collapse phenomenon was more obvious at the calcination time of 60 min the xrd patterns of the bi pcms at the calcination times of 10 20 and 30 min were shown in fig 5b the characteristics of the diffraction peaks at 10 and 20 min were basically the same and most of them were attributed to the bi0 phase while those of bi2o3 were very weak in the xrd pattern obtained by 30 min calcination there were not only the stronger diffraction peaks of bi0 but also the strong diffraction peaks of bi2o3 which can be used as the chloride removal agent because the cl removal performance is mainly originated from bi2o3 rather than bi0 however the presence of bi0 may enhance the chloride removal efficiency since the lspr can be generated on the bi0 nanoparticles so there will be a synergistic effect between the crystal phases of bi0 and bi2o3 in the bi pcms the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the bi pcms were given in fig 5c where all of them were ascribed to type iv with the h2 hysteresis loop wang et al 2015 meaning there was the mesoporous structure property for the bi pcms the pore size distributions of the bi pcms calcined for 10 20 and 30 min were provided in fig 5d and the average pore sizes were 3 038 4 879 and 1 795 nm table s2 respectively the bet specific surface area of the bi pcm calcined at 30 min reached 40 m2 g table s2 which was slightly larger than those obtained at the calcination times of 10 29 m2 g and 20 min 33 m2 g compared with other calcination times the bi pcm at 30 min has the advantages in micropore size and specific surface area which can accommodate more bi0 nanoparticles and prevent their loss due to the adhesion force of the porous carbon therefore the bi pcm sample calcined for 30 min was chosen for the cl removal experiments 3 2 cl removal performance over one single bi pcm to evaluate the cl removal performance one single bi pcm was put into 50 ml simulated wastewater with the cl concentration of 500 mg l the ph effect on the cl removal performance was first investigated under the dark condition as shown in fig s2 the cl concentrations decreased to 441 474 480 and 498 mg l at the initial ph values of 1 2 3 and 5 respectively and the corresponding chloride removal efficiencies of 11 8 5 3 3 9 and 0 4 were obtained according to the bi2o3 based cl removal method the formation of biocl can be seen in eq 1 dou et al 2019 huang et al 2020 wu et al 2022 1 b i 2 o 3 2 h 2 c l 2 biocl h 2 o where the h ions are needed to dissolve bi2o3 and release bi3 ions at the initial ph values of 3 and 5 the removed capacities of cl ions were very small because there were not enough h ions to drive the cl removal reaction and the terminal ph even increased to 3 45 and 5 09 respectively fig s2 when the initial ph values were reduced to 2 and 1 although their terminal values also increased to 2 27 and 1 32 respectively higher chloride removal efficiencies were obtained and the latter was about twice as much as the former indicating the higher content of h ions was conducive to the improvement of cl removal performance however further reducing the ph would increase the cost and the dissolution of the bi related crystal phases so the ph 1 was selected as the optimum condition it is noted that the cl removal capacity is related to the amount of bi2o3 exposed on the porous surface of bi pcm although the removal efficiency of 11 8 at ph 1 was low fig 6 a the utilization efficiency of bi2o3 on bi pcm might have already reached the maximum the resultant pcm was taken out and dried fig 6b and many white precipitates were adsorbed on the surface these white precipitates were actually attributed to the cl removal product of biocl dou et al 2019 huang et al 2020 li et al 2021 wu et al 2022 which was marked as biocl pcm the traditional bi2o3 method needs to recover the biocl powder after the cl removal by contrast this experiment avoids the trouble of centrifugal separation of the biocl powder where the biocl can be tightly attached on the porous surface of the pcm which facilitates the next steps of wet regeneration and the cl removal cycles the cleavage of cl in the single biocl pcm was then performed by using naoh to obtain the regenerated bi pcm fig 6c and the color of the particles adhered to the surface of the black pcm was changed from white to yellow these yellow particles were assigned to bi2o3 dou et al 2019 huang et al 2020 li et al 2021 wu et al 2022 which did not fall off during the wet regeneration process in the second and third cycles over the regenerated bi pcm the cl concentrations respectively decreased to 447 and 446 mg l which were almost the same as that obtained from the first cycle however the lower cl concentrations of 382 and 396 mg l were achieved in the fourth and fifth cycles and the chloride removal efficiencies reached 23 6 and 20 8 respectively because the cl removal capacity is tightly associated with the exposure of bi2o3 after the repeated use of the bi pcm more bi2o3 particles were exposed through stripping off the carbon covered on the surface of the bi0 bi2o3 particles indeed we could see from fig 4h that the surface of the initial bi pcm was covered by the black carbon or other impurities produced from the pyrolysis carbonization of the resin model fig 6d and the yellow color of bi2o3 was not obvious after the first cycle of cl removal the white colored biocl was obvious on the pcm as the cycles increased more and more chloride removal agents of bi0 bi2o3 were exposed on the regenerated bi pcm leading to the increment of the chloride removal efficiency 3 3 cl removal performance over multiple bi pcms since the chloride removal efficiency over one single bi pcm was very limited to maximize the advantage of the bi pcm the cl removal experiment over the system with multiple bi pcms was designed wherein the size of the bi pcms used was the largest among the prepared models same composition as shown in fig 7 a 2 l simulated wastewater containing 500 mg l of cl ions was passed through the quartz tube containing seven bi pcms under the conditions of dark environment ph 1 and reaction time of 5 h a terminal cl concentration of 386 mg l was obtained fig s3 and the corresponding chloride removal efficiency of 22 9 was higher than that 10 0 at ph 2 accordingly the condition of ph 1 was selected for the cycling experiments it could be seen from fig 7b that as the cycles extended the chloride removal efficiencies were stable and on the fourth and fifth cycles the slightly higher values of 26 6 and 25 7 were achieved respectively although the chloride removal efficiency increased compared with that over one single bi pcm the cl capacity removed in the total wastewater was still not enough both of bi2o3 and biocl are the excellent photocatalysts sayed et al 2022 and considering the holes and active free radicals with strong oxidative properties generated on them may improve the chloride removal efficiency the uv light driven experiment was designed and shown in fig 7c at the first cycle the concentration of cl ions in the wastewater significantly decreased to 306 mg l fig s3 and a high chloride removal efficiency of 38 8 was achieved which was still higher than that 21 8 at ph 2 meanwhile the increments of their terminal ph values were also larger than those in the dark meaning more h ions had been consumed in the light irradiation condition it is worth to point out that from the second cycle the chloride removal efficiencies even increased to 55 60 and in the fifth cycle a highest value of 63 6 was present which was about 2 3 times that in the dark fig 7e showed the optical image of the initial multiple bi pcms in the quartz tube where the yellow color of bi2o3 was not obvious due to the coverage by the black porous carbon after 5 h of uv light irradiation a large number of white precipitates appeared on the surface of the pcms fig 7f and the biocl pcms were obtained in the regeneration process the naoh solution 2 mol l was pumped into the quartz tube and the biocl pcms were immersed for the cleavage of cl ions the optical image of the regenerated bi pcms after the fourth cycle of naoh treatment was given in fig 7g and the yellow color was present on the surface of the pcms which was originated from the bi2o3 converted from the cleavage of cl in biocl importantly after four cycles the bi2o3 particles were still tightly attached to the porous surface of the pcms the concentration of bi3 ions in the wastewater after the first cycle was detected by icp oes to be 3 388 mg l but after the fifth cycles the bi3 ions were undetectable indicating the bi related crystal phases were very stable by the adherence of the porous carbon which ensured the effective cl removal performance of the bi pcms 3 4 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of the pcms before and after cl removal were shown in fig 8 the initial bi pcm possessed two crystal phases of bi0 jcpds card no 85 1329 and bi2o3 jcpds card no 78 1793 after the cl removal a new phase of biocl jcpds card no 85 0861 obviously appeared in the resultant biocl pcm meanwhile there was a certain amount of bi2o3 left in the biocl pcm which was attributed to the unreacted bi2o3 in the bi0 bi2o3 biocl structure or in the inner part of pcm since the powder for xrd detection was selected from the partial biocl pcm including the surface bi0 biocl and inner bi0 bi2o3 in the wet regeneration process the cleavage of cl in biocl was realized by naoh treatment and even after the fourth cycle the residual cl content could still be controlled in a very low level because there were almost no biocl related diffraction peaks in the regenerated bi pcm indicating most of biocl had been converted into bi2o3 3 5 morphologies and microstructures the morphology of the initial bi pcm was first observed by sem and there were abundant 3d porous structures in the cross section fig 9 a which were consisted of many ligaments and hierarchical pores with different sizes fig 9b was an enlarged view of fig 9a and it could be observed that many nanoparticles were distributed on the surface of the pores to confirm their compositions the sem eds characterization was performed and the elemental mapping results of bi o and c were given in fig 9c d and e respectively it could be found that the c was used to keep the 3d skeleton whose ligaments were mainly loaded with bi and o elements on the inner surface of the hierarchical pores small contents of bi and o were also detected but the signal of bi seemed to be relatively stronger than that of o fig 9f according to the element contents listed in table s3 the entire atomic ratio of bi o c was detected to be 1 21 75 102 25 the c was mainly originated from porous carbon material while the o content was much higher than the theoretical value of bi2o3 which might be originated from the incomplete carbonized resin the microstructure of the initial bi pcm was further studied by tem as shown in fig 9g there were many black nano spherical particles tightly imbedded in the porous carbon fragments the size range of these nano spherical particles was approximately 11 102 nm with an average size of 43 nm fig s4a the enlarged image was shown in fig 9h and the core shell structure clearly appeared for almost all the spherical particles fig 9i was the high resolution tem hrtem image of a nano spherical particle with core and shell sizes of 26 and 6 nm respectively the fast fourier transform fft pattern selected from the core contained the 012 planes of bi0 and that from the shell included the 220 planes of bi2o3 indicating a core shell structure of bi0 bi2o3 was formed for the nano spherical particles whose bi2o3 was generated from the surface oxidation of bi0 the sem morphologies of the biocl pcm were provided in fig 10 a and b and many particles were distributed on the porous surface of the cross section to confirm the composition of these particles their sem eds mappings were tested it could be found that throughout the cross section of biocl pcm fig 10a the elements of bi fig 10c o fig 10d and cl fig 10e were distributed on the particles fig 10a and the geometrical profile of the remaining pores was still clear the c element was distributed around the 3d skeleton fig 10f which was taken as the substrate to load the bi o and cl elements fig 10g and adsorb them to avoid their loss in the cl removal and regeneration process the atomic ratio of bi o c cl was calculated to be 1 20 1 78 2 0 7 table s3 and the high content of cl meant a large part of bi2o3 had been converted to biocl the tem image of the biocl pcm was shown in fig 10h and in the porous carbon fragments there were also embedded with many black nano spherical particles and their size range was 17 170 nm with an average size of 65 nm fig s4b which was higher than that 43 nm in the initial bi pcm indicating the whole size of the spherical particles increased after cl removal the hrtem image of one spherical particle with size of 58 nm was shown in fig 10i which was tightly embedded into the porous carbon meanwhile there were clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0 75 nm in the area of the nano sheets fig s5 whose fft pattern contained the 001 planes of biocl suggesting that there were very thin biocl nano sheets distributed on bi0 bi2o3 to form the bi0 bi2o3 biocl nanoparticles 3 6 xps analysis xps detection was performed to investigate the surface compositions of bi pcm and biocl pcm as shown in their survey scan xps spectra fig s6 there were the main elements of bi o and c contained in the initial bi pcm and after the cl removal the additional element of cl included in the biocl pcm meanwhile in the pcms a small peak attributing the element of n appeared which might be caused by the incomplete carbonized resin fig 11 a showed the high resolution xps spectra of bi 4f wherein the peaks of bi pcm at 164 9 and 159 6 ev were attributed to the bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 of bi2o3 respectively and the weaker peaks at 160 6 and 157 2 ev were generated by the metallic bi0 wang et al 2021 after the cl removal due to the production of biocl the bi 4f peaks of biocl pcm were slightly shifted notably the weak signal of bi0 in bi pcm was caused by the thick shells of bi2o3 on the bi0 cores differently the bi 4f signal of biocl pcm was much stronger than that of bi pcm suggesting the exposure of the bi related phases was more obvious after the stripping of some carbon materials which was consistent with the optical images present in figs 6 and 7 fig 11b showed the o 1s spectra and three peaks could be fitted the peaks of bi pcm at 530 6 531 8 and 533 4 ev were ascribed to the lattice oxygen oxygen vacancies and the adsorbed h2o or oh groups park et al 2018 respectively whose positions were then slightly shifted to higher values for biocl pcm the c 1s spectra in fig 11c could also be fitted into three peaks at 288 9 286 2 and 284 8 ev for bi pcm and biocl pcm the peak at 284 8 ev mainly corresponded to the c c groups of the amorphous carbon and those at 286 2 and 288 9 ev were respectively assigned to the c o and c o groups which were originated by the incomplete carbonized resin or the adsorbed co2 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the cl 2p spectrum of biocl pcm was given in fig 11d and the two fitted peaks at 200 1 and 198 5 ev were ascribed to cl 2p1 2 and cl 2p3 2 of biocl respectively indicating the adsorption of cl by the porous carbon could be negligible the element contents obtained by xps were listed in table s3 and based on the bi cl atomic ratio of 1 1 8 the higher cl content compared with that bi cl 1 0 7 obtained by sem eds meant that most of the cl removal products of biocl were located on the surface of biocl pcm to form the bi0 bi2o3 biocl structure 3 7 cl removal mechanism the light driven experiments showed the chloride removal efficiency was improved about 2 3 times that under the dark condition which was associated with the light response performance of the bi related phases such as bi0 bi2o3 and biocl it is noted that under uv light irradiation the lspr effect of the metallic bi0 nanoparticles can be excited and based on the semiconductors of bi2o3 and biocl the active species such as the o2 and oh radicals and holes h with strong oxidation properties can also be generated 3 7 1 light absorption property to investigate the light absorption properties of the initial bi pcm biocl pcm and the regenerated bi pcm samples their uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra were tested and shown in fig 12 a due to the presence of the porous carbon all the three samples had a broadband light absorption range which extended to the near infrared light region for the short wavelength absorption including uv light was mainly contributed by the semiconductors of bi2o3 and biocl notably biocl pcm possessed two relatively strong absorption peaks at 268 and 312 nm which should be originated from the lspr effect of bi0 dong et al 2014 toudert et al 2012 because the whole particle size of the spherical particles consisting of bi0 bi2o3 biocl was distributed in the wide range of 17 170 nm fig s4b as for the initial bi pcm and the regenerated bi pcm only the weak plasmonic peaks were present due to the barrier coatings of the porous carbon or the bi2o3 which was consistent with their surface appearances fig 6b d and 7e g and the peak intensities in the bi 4f xps spectra fig 11a 3 7 2 oxygen vacancy in the carbonization process the formation of bi0 consumed carbon or carbon monoxide co which could be seen in eqs 2 and 3 wang et al 2021 respectively 2 b i 2 o 3 3 c 2 b i 0 3 co 3 b i 2 o 3 3 co 2 b i 0 3 c o 2 on a basis of the formed bi0 nanoparticles the bi2o3 was generated by the surface oxidation of bi0 eq 4 and then the core shell structure of bi0 bi2o3 could be obtained 4 4 b i 0 3 o 2 2 b i 2 o 3 it is conceivable that some surface defects such as oxygen vacancies are probably formed in the carbonization process which may strongly affect the chemical and electronic structures of the pcm samples so their esr spectra were tested and shown in 12b all the three samples had the symmetrical esr signal peaks at g 2 0002 corresponding to the single electron oxygen vacancy li et al 2017 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 among them the initial bi pcm had the strongest signal suggesting its oxygen vacancy content was the highest after the cl removal the oxygen vacancy signal decreased in biocl pcm and in the regenerated bi pcm the lower signal was further detected which should be caused by the recrystallization in the phase transformation of bi2o3 to biocl and to bi2o3 again however it could be inferred that the oxygen vacancies were mainly present in the bi related phases such as bi2o3 and biocl rather than in the porous carbon since there was no significant change for the porous carbon in the cl removal and regeneration processes furthermore even after four cycles there was still a part of oxygen vacancies contained in the regenerated bi pcm to assist the electron hole pair separation and then enhance the generation of active free radicals 3 7 3 active species to test whether there were the active free radicals produced in the cl removal process the esr dmpo capture experiments of the oh and o2 radicals were performed under uv light irradiation the esr spectra of the dmpo oh signals over the initial bi pcm biocl pcm and the regenerated bi pcm were provided in fig 12c at the reaction times of 10 and 15 min the four line esr peaks related to the oh radicals were detected with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 but the signal intensity of biocl pcm was more obvious than those of the other two samples when capturing the o2 radicals fig 12d the related six characteristic peaks were measured with similar strength while biocl pcm still had higher productivity than those of other samples accordingly it could be indicated that the cl removal product of biocl in the bi0 bi2o3 system was conducive to the production of the oh and o2 radicals however in terms of the dmpo oh and dmpo o2 signal intensities fig 12c and d the production ability of o2 was higher than that of oh indicating the o2 radicals might be more important for the improved chloride removal efficiency of bi pcm to verify this conjecture the trapping experiments over the powders collected from the pcms were carried out wherein the oh o2 and hole h were quenched by the ipa bq and ao scavengers respectively and oh cl were quenched by tba as shown in fig 13 a in the absence of the scavengers the initial cl concentration of 500 mg l decreased to 440 mg l after reaction of 2 h with the introduction of ipa bq ao and tba the terminal cl concentrations were 460 476 471 and 464 mg l respectively indicating the inhibition effect of o2 for the removal of cl ions was the highest followed by the h with the quenching of oh there was a certain decrease of the chloride removal efficiency as for the cl only a weak interference was exhibited which might be caused by its high conversion rate to biocl dou et al 2019 wu et al 2022 as a result the suppression of the cl removal was in the order of o2 h oh cl meaning the improved chloride removal efficiency under uv light irradiation was originated from these active species generated 3 7 4 photocorrosion by holes to interpret the generation of the active species of oh o2 h and cl the electronic structures of the bi related crystal phases in the pcm samples were illustrated the valence band vb xps spectra of the initial bi pcm biocl pcm and the regenerated bi pcm were shown in fig 13b c and d respectively and their vb edge positions were calculated to be 3 5 2 4 and 2 8 ev lower than their fermi energy bands which exhibited blueshift from the transformation of bi2o3 biocl the regenerated bi2o3 there were two crystal phases of bi0 and bi2o3 in the initial bi pcm under uv light irradiation the excitation wavelength of 253 7 nm was close to one plasmonic peak 268 nm of the bi0 nanoparticles fig 12a so the light energy could be sufficiently absorbed to generate hot electrons e and holes h since the fermi level 0 17 ev of bi0 is more negative than the conduction band cb edge 0 4 ev of bi2o3 dong et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the hot electrons were transferred to the cb of bi2o3 fig 14 which then moved to the porous carbon to produce the o2 radicals gao et al 2016 due to the transfer of electrons hot holes were left on the surface of bi0 or its interface with bi2o3 coating so the photocorrosion could be easily occurred burleigh et al 2003 wherein the surface bi0 might be oxidized by holes to release bi3 ions eq 5 5 b i 0 3 h b i 3 meanwhile the bi2o3 on the contact interface internal surface with bi0 and that on the outer surface of the bi2o3 coating could also be photo corroded fig 14 it was reported that a trapped hole on the surface could generate an o s u r f a c e through its reaction with the surface oxygen ion o s u r f a c e 2 eq 6 which was weakly bonded to the crystal lattice of bi2o3 and its local position could be changed dou et al 2021 gerischer 1966 when a second hole was trapped by the neighboring o s u r f a c e 2 another o s u r f a c e was generated to form the ionic group of o o 2 eq 7 with two remaining weak bonds attached to the crystal lattice subsequently the o o 2 could quickly react with another two holes to produce an o2 eq 8 and two electrons were left in the original crystal lattice which was unstable and easily to release bi3 ions into the solution the total reaction for the dissolution of bi2o3 by holes was expressed in eq 9 as a result the photocorrosion of bi0 and bi2o3 was realized to assist the release of bi3 ions in the acidic solution which were easily reacted with the cl ions to form biocl eq 1 6 o s u r f a c e 2 h o s u r f a c e 7 o s u r f a c e h o s u r f a c e 2 o o 2 8 o o 2 2 h o 2 9 2 b i 2 o 3 12 h 4 b i 3 3 o 2 3 7 5 oxidation of cl to cl as for the bi2o3 coating because of its higher cb edge 0 4 ev than the potential 0 33 ev of o2 o2 wu et al 2019 its photogenerated electrons could not react with o2 to produce o2 and instead they would transfer to the porous carbon fig 14 then the holes left on the vb vb edge 3 2 ev of bi2o3 huang et al 2020 and they would not only cause the photocorrosion of bi2o3 but also react with h2o to generate oh eq 10 or directly oxidize cl to form cl eq 11 since the wastewater was at acidic ph ph 1 there were enough h ions to react with oh to produce cl eq 12 subsequently these resultant cl radicals could directly react with bi2o3 to produce biocl with the participants of the hot electrons and h ions eq 13 dou et al 2019 wu et al 2022 so the cl removal process was accelerated it is noted that due to this fast conversion of cl into biocl dou et al 2019 wu et al 2022 the esr signal of cl is difficult to detect and although its inhibition effect of cl removal is not obvious compared with those of o2 and oh fig 13a its important role should not be ignored 10 h h 2 o oh h 11 h c l c l 12 oh c l h c l h 2 o 13 2 c l b i 2 o 3 2 e 2 h 2 biocl h 2 o 3 7 6 o2 radicals according to the radical trapping experiments the o2 played an important role for the cl removal one possible explanation was that fig 14 in the acidic wastewater ph 1 o2 was easily reacted with h to generate an intermediate h2o2 eq 14 which was then converted to oh after accepting electrons eq 15 hirakawa and nosaka 2002 wang et al 2022 when the oh radicals were formed more cl radicals would be produced to enhance the formation of biocl meanwhile if two cl radicals were combined the cl2 gas would be formed eq 16 peng et al 2019 and then the hocl was easily produced from the reaction between cl2 and h2o eq 17 which would inhibit the cl removal reaction however o2 was able to activate the hocl to produce oh and to release cl eq 18 cheng et al 2021 cheng et al 2020 so the chloride removal efficiency could be improved 14 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 15 h 2 o 2 e oh o h 16 c l c l c l 2 17 c l 2 h 2 o hocl hcl 18 hocl o 2 oh c l o 2 3 7 7 important role of biocl after the cl removal under uv light irradiation the biocl pcm was obtained and the energy band diagram of its heterostructures was shown in the bottom side of fig 14 the fermi level 0 17 ev of bi0 was more positive than the cb edge 1 0 ev of biocl huang et al 2020 so the uv excited electrons on the cb of biocl were transferred to the electron band of bi0 and then transferred to the porous carbon to produce o2 since there was bi2o3 remained in biocl pcm the electrons could also indirectly move to the cb of bi2o3 before reaching the porous carbon the bi0 nanoparticles could be taken as the electron sinks and the electron hole pair recombination could be greatly suppressed meanwhile the lspr effect of the bi0 nanoparticles was still present and not only the hot electrons were produced but a partial electromagnetic field around them could be formed to further accelerate the electron hole pair separation as a result there were abundant electrons transferred to the porous carbon to generate the o2 radicals which could be demonstrated from the strongest signals in the esr dmpo capture results fig 12d after the transfer of electrons more holes were remained on the vb of biocl which could directly oxidize cl to cl because the vb edge 2 4 ev of biocl was approximately equal to the potential 2 4 ev of h2o oh wu et al 2019 the oh could also be formed to convert cl to cl to enhance the chloride removal efficiency it is noted that in the biocl pcm sample its surface is almost covered by biocl and the amount of bi2o3 is largely reduced so the contribution of bi2o3 to the yields of oh and o2 is very limited furthermore from the stronger oh and o2 signals of biocl pcm than those of bi pcm it can be inferred that the formation of biocl is conducive to the generation of active species in the cl removal process according to the above discussion the chloride removal efficiency was greatly improved with uv light irradiation and the related mechanism could be explained as follow 1 the hot holes generated from the lspr of bi0 and those left in the vb of bi2o3 caused photocorrosion to them and more bi3 ions could be released to react with cl ions to form biocl 2 the holes could directly oxidize the cl ions to produce the cl radicals 3 the oh radicals could be formed by the reaction between holes and h2o which were then converted to the cl radicals by their oxidation of cl ions 4 the cl radicals could be directly reacted with bi2o3 to form biocl 5 in the acidic condition the o2 could be converted to oh and then to cl and 6 the cl2 gas was easily formed by the combination of cl radicals and the hocl would be generated to inhibit the cl removal reaction but the o2 could react with hocl to form cl and oh on a basis of these advantages the high light response chloride removal efficiency can be obtained over the bi pcms 3 8 cl removal performance in real wastewater to further investigate the actual cl removal performance of bi pcms the desulfurization wastewater with cl concentration of 3191 mg l and ph of 2 54 was selected and before its pump into the quartz tube with fresh multiple bi pcms the ph was adjusted to 1 it is noted that the desulfurization wastewater generated in the limestone gypsum desulfurization process is not scared of sulfate and other salts but its biggest problem is attributed to the high concentration of cl ions which will cause serious corrosion to the equipment if the cl concentration can be largely reduced the desulfurization wastewater will be reused to avoid the costly treatment methods and the consumption of fresh water according to the light enhanced cl removal experiment in the simulated wastewater over the multiple bi pcms fig 7d the removal amount of cl was about 600 mg 500 mg l 60 2 l when the removal efficiency was 60 in one cycle 1 l of the desulfurization wastewater was pumped through the quartz tube containing the multiple bi pcms and there was about 3191 mg of cl ions which needed about five cycles to decrease the cl concentration as shown in fig 15 a in the dark condition after five cycles the cl concentration in the wastewater was reduced from 3191 to 2253 mg l and a total chloride removal efficiency of 29 4 was obtained under the uv light irradiation the cl concentration largely decreased from 3191 to 366 mg l and the chloride removal efficiency reached 88 5 fig 15b by comparison an improvement of about 3 times was obtained with the uv light irradiation which was contributed by the generated hot holes and the oh o2 and cl radicals the optical image of the regenerated bi pcms after the fourth cycle of alkaline treatment was shown in fig 15c and the bi2o3 related yellow color on the surface could be obviously observed when the fifth cycle of cl removal was finished the biocl related white color on the surface of biocl pcm could still be found in the real wastewater there are often other impurity ions such as so4 2 no3 al3 fe3 zn2 cu2 mg2 and ca2 and their individual effect on the cl removal with uv light irradiation was provided in fig s7 in comparison with the blank group the impurity ions of so4 2 no3 al3 zn2 mg2 and ca2 only had a slight effect on the removal of cl ions however in the presence of cu2 and fe3 ions the cl concentrations decreased from the initial 500 to 369 and 395 mg l respectively which were much lower than that 440 mg l of the blank group exhibiting their promotion effect for the cl removal it is conceivable that the cucl precipitate may be generated from the reduction reaction of cu2 ions caused by the electrons generated with uv light irradiation peng et al 2019 for the fe3 ions the photo fenton reaction may be occurred to enhance the generation of active oxygen radicals miralles cuevas et al 2021 and the cl removal performance can thus be improved it is noted that in the desulfurization wastewater there are also the impurity ions such as no3 al3 zn2 mg2 and ca2 table s1 but the chloride removal efficiency of bi pcm was not influenced by these co existing ions indicating the good selectivity of cl ions by the bi based chloride removal agents therefore the bi pcms constructed has a great application prospect in the removal of cl ions from wastewater 4 conclusion to obtain a cl removal technology that is both environmentally friendly and cost saving the 3d printing technology combined with the bi2o3 method is developed the bi containing precursor was mixed into the photosensitive resin and through a high temperature carbonization process the bi pcm was obtained wherein the bi0 bi2o3 core shell nanoparticles were tightly attached on the surface of the hierarchical porous carbon in the dark condition after five cycles of cl removal the chloride removal efficiencies over one single bi pcm and the multiple bi pcms were about 20 8 and 25 7 respectively upon the uv light irradiation the chloride removal efficiency over the multiple bi pcms increased to 63 6 at the fifth cycle which even reached 89 in the treatment of desulfurization wastewater the light enhanced cl removal performance of bi pcm was contributed by the photocorrosion of bi0 and bi2o3 which was caused by the holes generated from the lspr effect of bi0 and the heterostructures and more bi3 ions were released to participate into the cl removal process the holes and active free radicals of oh and o2 were also able to convert cl into cl which directly reacted with bi2o3 to form biocl the bi pcms not only have high light response chloride removal efficiency but also can be easily regenerated with alkaline solution exhibiting a promising application prospect in the cl removal from wastewater supplementary material additional information about the cl removal setup the cl removal efficiencies at
