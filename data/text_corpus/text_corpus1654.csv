8270,study region the pra river catchment in ghana west africa study focus knowledge of the spatio temporal distribution of wet and dry spells are crucial for rain fed agriculture at the pra river catchment this study characterised spells and their associated atmospheric dynamics at the pra river catchment specifically the variability of historical and future wet and dry spells and atmospheric dynamics on the rainfall and spell patterns at the catchment were studied new hydrological insights short duration spells have a higher occurrence at the catchment as compared to long duration spells seasonally short duration dry spells are most common in december february whereas wet spells are expected in march may future scenarios show an increase in both wet and dry spells composites of the atmospheric dynamics for 2 3 day dry spells show moisture convergence over the entire catchment with lower total column water levels however there is a dipole of moisture convergence and divergence for wet spell composites with higher than normal total column water an anticyclonic circulation inducing a ridge at 500 hpa coupled with low level southerlies at 850 hpa act to support wet spell occurrences in jja the findings contribute to sub seasonal and seasonal forecasting and hence will improve agricultural practices in the catchment in support of food security keywords wet and dry spells atmospheric dynamics representative concentration pathways rcp 1 introduction over the past few decades the distribution of rainfall in sub saharan africa is observed to have high spatio temporal variability owusu and waylen 2013 bibi et al 2014 inter annual to decadal and multi decadal changes in rainfall pattern have been observed which has negatively affected the amount of water needed to support the dominant rain fed agricultural practices baidu et al 2017 these changes have been linked to the atmospheric dynamics nicholson 1979 2000 2001 nicholson and paloa 1993 eltahir and gong 1996 the effect of coupled modes such as enso and other tele connections ronghui and yifang 1989 lare and nicholson 1994 diaz et al 2001 gergis and fowler 2009 changes in land use dynamics resulting from anthropogenic invasion pachauri et al 2014 awotwi et al 2017 and climate change and variability pachauri et al 2014 besides the fifth assessment report of the ipcc pachauri et al 2014 observed an increasing trend for extreme rainfall and discharge events in regional scale catchments and suggested a likely increase in the risk of flash floods schmidli and frei 2005 also observed that the recent occurrences in rainfall extremities have gradually increased in the 20th century as possible response to global climate change knowledge in the spatio temporal distribution of wet and dry spells is crucial for determining of rainfall onset cessation and length of the growing season in the face of current climate change and variability these spells are closely linked to the water balance at the local scale and serve as the best proxies for determining crop water stress and timing froidurot and diedhiou 2017 for instance an extreme rainfall event incorporated within an existing long wet period is likely to result in worse damages due to antecedent wet conditions mandapaka et al 2016 and references therein shorter dry spell duration embedded in more wet days during the growing season are more beneficial to agriculture than an increase of dry days with less but longer duration dry spells yorke et al 2010 bouagila and sushama 2013 furthermore large scale atmospheric dynamics which drive the rainfall patterns over the tropics influence the duration of various wet and dry spell lengths of a region for instance singh et al 2014 found that changes in extremely dry and wet spells in india are the consequences of increases in convective available potential energy low level moisture convergence and large scale circulation changes aloft in the atmosphere therefore an integration of atmospheric dynamics in the characterisation and effects of spells over a region will enhance the knowledge and prediction of wet and dry spells and provide policy makers with more reliable tools in ghana the variability of dry spells during the rainy season has been observed to be higher in the south than the north yorke et al 2010 logah et al 2013 a shortening rainy season with longer duration of dry spells in hand with extreme weather events have been reported in northern ghana rademacher schulz et al 2014 and references therein a result which would have dire consequences on food security and water resource management logah et al 2013 further discovered that although average rainfall amounts in ghana had begun to increase from 1981 to 2010 its rate is instead on a decline at 8 6 1991 2000 to 2 6 2001 2010 contrarily manzanas et al 2014 observed a decreasing increasing trend of precipitation for the first second half for the years 1961 1985 1986 2010 hence understanding of these variability gives a piece of first hand information on the design of early warning systems and other hydro agricultural infrastructures froidurot and diedhiou 2017 the pra catchment is the second largest in ghana and has a population of about five million and an annual growth rate of 2 2 water resource commission 2012 in recent times the catchment has attracted research interest resulting from increased human activities such as active deforestation to accommodate illegal mining activities these activities have resulted in changes in the land cover and consequently altered the hydrologic cycle and macro climate of the catchment according to awotwi et al 2018 between 1986 2016 the land degradation at the pra catchment has undergone six different phases with settlement cropland and mining activities obtaining increment rates of 130 198 and 304 respectively the consequences of this is a statistically significant decreasing trend in post cessation and pre onset of rains in february and march for the entire catchment awotwi et al 2017 mayeem 2017 observed that deforestation and land degradation were the environmental footprints of changes in land use cover owing to the increase in surface mining at the birim north district a sub catchment of the pra river catchment awotwi et al 2019 also focused on modelling the water balance at the pra catchment and found a reduction in surface runoff and water yield during the dry season and increased baseflow and evapotranspiration during the wet season between 1986 to 2016 only a few rainfall studies so far has been reported in the pra catchment owusu and waylen 2009 manzanas et al 2014 awotwi et al 2017 these studies have observed an increasing trend in annual rainfall totals from 1986 to 2015 the water resource commission of ghana in 2012 provided an integrated water resources management plan for the pra catchment which focused on the understanding of the water resource potential through water availability utilisation quality and demand water resource commission 2012 however studies on the characteristics of rainfall in the catchment have been absent this study characterised wet and dry spells and associated atmospheric dynamics at the pra catchment to improve our understanding of the rainfall dynamics the variability of wet and dry spells of different lengths is assessed at the annual seasonal and sub seasonal timescales for 39 years projections of these characteristics are also evaluated under different climate change scenarios using three representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 furthermore the wet days were analysed on the seasonal timescale and the influence of atmospheric dynamics seasonal divergence convergence over the catchment examined the remaining parts of this manuscript is structured as follows section 2 presents an overview of the study area data and methods in section 3 results presented in section 4 with discussions in section 5 and conclusions in section 6 2 study site description the pra river catchment in ghana see fig 1 the second largest is located within longitude 2 30 w and 0 30 w and latitude 5 n and 7 30 n with approximately 23 200 km2 area water resource commission 2012 four main tributaries including rivers oda offin birim and anum originate from the eastern and north western fringes and flow southwards into the pra river the main pra river is sourced from the kwahu plateau in the eastern region e r and exits into the gulf of guinea at shama in the western region w r of ghana see fig 1 at the centre of the catchment is the only natural lake named bosomtwe the catchment is well known for its gold mining activities in the western and ashanti regions a r with the birim sub catchment eastern region known for its diamond mining water resource commission 2012 majority of the towns within the catchment have been under rapid urbanisation and agricultural practices the pra catchment climate is sub equatorial and monsoonal with its rainfall modulated by the seasonal movement of the inter tropical discontinuity itd parker 2017 it results in a bimodal rainfall pattern in the catchment its major rainy season is between march and july and a minor season from september to the first dekad of november amekudzi et al 2015 fig 2 a shows the mean accumulated annual rainfall climatology based on thirty nine years of the chirps datasets 1981 2019 ranges between 1200 1700 mm spatio temporally the distribution decreases at the extreme south and the north to northwest of the catchment and the maximum rainfall lies at the southwest to northeast see fig 2a the minimum maximum and mean temperatures of the catchment are shown in fig 2b d based on the era5 dataset from 1981 to 2019 the minimum temperature fig 2b shows the lowest values 19 20 c around the mountainous and forested regions noticeable at the north east north west and south of the catchment meanwhile the central portion of the catchment has a moderate minimum temperature of 20 21 c whereas the extreme south has the highest minimum temperature between 21 22 c on the other hand the catchment s maximum temperature is between 28 38 c following a south north latitudinal decline fig 2c the overall mean in temperature fig 2d observes low magnitude within 25 c at the mountainous and forested areas and a slight maximum of about 27 c at the north of the catchment the catchment elevation fig 1 ranges between 2 m to about 830 m above mean sea level 3 data and methods 3 1 data sources 3 1 1 chirps dataset the climate hazards group infrared precipitation combined with station data chirps is a quasi global gridded precipitation product with timescales ranging from daily to seasonal peterson et al 2013 it is a highly resolved dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 and a temporal resolution from 1981 to present chirps is a merge of rainfall products from various sources including global climatology in situ rainfall observations and satellite estimates to produce precipitation with timesteps ranging from daily to seasonal funk et al 2015 in this study chirps version 2 0 v2 0 was employed to analyse the spatio temporal dynamics of dry and wet spells of various duration between 1981 to 2019 the chirps product was used because it has an excellent agreement with station rainfall over ghana atiah et al 2020 3 1 2 ecmwf reanalysis fifth generation era5 era5 is a fifth generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate hersbach et al 2020 it assimilates global observations with model data to produce a consistent dataset based on physical laws copernicus climate change service c3s 2017 the datasets are quality controlled during the assimilation process while the physical laws allow for the estimation of data in sparse locations era5 uses a 4d var assimilation method to produce daily hourly estimates of climate variables globally at a 31 km horizontal resolution and 137 vertical levels extending from the surface to 0 01 hpa these hourly variables comprises of data on both single levels and pressure levels besides the hourly data there is also a monthly data product in the present study era5 monthly averages of u and v components of the wind and the divergence field obtained on pressure levels 1000 hpa to 100 hpa from 1981 to 2019 while vertically integrated moisture divergence and total column water also obtained on monthly averaged single levels for the same period were used these datasets have a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 lon lat 3 2 projection data 3 2 1 mpi esm mr the max planck institute mpi for meteorology earth system model esm is a general circulation model that couples the atmosphere ocean and land surface through the exchange of energy momentum water and carbon dioxide giorgetta et al 2013 the coupling between the various climate systems depends mainly on these surface fluxes and computed at atmospheric time step based on the atmosphere s actual state and the ocean s mean state at the last coupling interval the daily mean flux of precipitation over land is interpolated onto a 0 5 0 5 grid for river catchments the mixed resolution mr configuration of the model has higher vertical and horizontal resolutions in the atmosphere and ocean respectively giorgetta et al 2013 daily projection rainfall data from 2029 to 2099 and historical data spanning 1984 to 2005 from the mpi esm mr were obtained from https esgf data dkrz de projects esgf dkrz a single ensemble r1i1p1 each for three representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were employed in this study due to computational limitations over west africa mpi esm mr simulates the monsoon s dynamics very well kebe et al 2017 heinzeller et al 2018 agyekum et al 2018 zebaze et al 2019 with excellent correlation to observations sow et al 2020 3 2 2 comparison of bias correction methods the r package hyfo xu 2018 due to its flexibility on gridded datasets was used for bias correcting the chirps and mpi esm mr rainfall datasets three algorithms including the linear multiplicative scaling empirical quantile method eqm and gamma quantile method gqm were applied on the datasets the description of these methods can be found in teutschbein and seibert 2012 from fig 3 it can be observed that the linear multiplicative scaling method provides a reasonable estimate of the spatio temporal distribution in the historical chirps data as compared to eqm and gqm although eqm and gqm captures some spatial variabilities rainfall amounts are extremely over estimated this implies that for mpi esm mr projection rainfall datasets the linear multiplicative scaling method is most appropriate 3 3 analysis procedure the seasonal and annual frequency of wet and dry spells for this study s baseline period 1981 2019 were extracted from the chirps dataset for the pra catchment we set a threshold of 1 mm to distinguish between rainy and non rainy days as used in studies such as sivakumar 1992 yorke et al 2010 rademacher schulz et al 2014 froidurot and diedhiou 2017 and bichet and diedhiou 2018 therefore a wet dry spell occurs when there is a consecutive number of rainy non rainy days followed by non rainy rainy days in the present study the wet spells used are the 2 3 4 5 and 6 9 which follow the propagation of the african easterly waves and 10 20 day wet spells resulting from the african monsoon rainfall froidurot and diedhiou 2017 the duration of 2 3 4 6 7 15 and 16 21 were used for the dry spell analysis the seasonal wet days were extracted from the chirps data for the catchment and the 39 year mean of each seasonal spell computed the seasonal pattern of spells was split into three months of four quarters in a year december january and february djf march april and may mam june july and august jja and september october and november son after that sub seasonal analyses of selected months contributions to the wet and dry spell climatology were performed similarly the frequency of the wet and dry spell lengths was extracted on the annual timescale under the various rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 after bias correcting both historical and projection simulations mpi esm mr with the chirps datasets the atmospheric processes influence on the seasonal timescale at the catchment was assessed using the divergence field at four pressure levels 1000 hpa 850 hpa 500 hpa and 200 hpa the seasonal mean wind fields were analysed and superimposed on the divergence fields at various pressure levels to determine the wind speed and direction the seasonal mean of vertically integrated moisture divergence vimd and total water column tcw at the catchment was used to determine the region s moisture convergence and divergence including the availability of liquid water cloud ice and rain in a column extending from boundary layer to the top of the atmosphere we performed further analyses on the 2 3 day wet and dry spells by extracting similar days in which the spells occurred at about 90 of the grids by this composite anomaly analysis of tcw was computed on the extracted days however for extracted days of the divergence wind and vimd the anomaly was not calculated on the composites instead the average over the days is computed to preserve the areas of convergence and divergence of moisture we ensured that both datasets era5 and mpi esm mr were downscaled to the grid size resolution of chirps before analysis 4 results 4 1 annual climatology of spells the dry spells for the duration of 2 3 4 6 7 15 and 16 21 days are shown in fig 4 it is observed that shorter duration dry spells 2 3 and 4 6 day spells are most frequent in the pra catchment the 2 3 day spells fig 4a have a maximum frequency of about 27 and a minimum of about 18 a higher frequency of the 2 3 day is observed at the south of the catchment from its outlet at shama the mountainous and forested areas found at the middle and northeastern part of the catchment had 2 3 day spells which are lower less than 20 events possibly due to topographic influence microclimate enhancement in enhancing rainfall to the north and north west of the catchment the 2 3 day spell frequency has a reasonable period of between 20 to 22 events the 4 6 day dry spell lengths usually have frequency varying between 9 to 15 fig 4b the area characterised by lowest frequency in the 2 3 day dry spell shifts entirely to the north east of the catchment birim sub catchment in the 4 6 day dry spell with the maximum 13 15 frequency observed at the outlet of the catchment additionally a new maximum of about 11 to 12 events emerges north west offin sub catchment of the catchment in the 4 6 day dry spell the 7 15 day dry spell length is shown in fig 4c and a decrease in dry spell frequency 4 to maximum 7 events is observed the offin sub catchment is found to be susceptible to the influence of moderate frequency dry spells under the 7 15 day spell length the location of minimum spell frequency at the birim sub catchment shifts to the higher elevation mountainous ranges see fig 1 a spatial extension of the minima at the birim sub catchment is shown in the 16 21 day dry spell with frequency of about 2 events fig 5 shows the wet spell lengths for 2 3 4 5 6 9 and 10 20 days contrary to observations in fig 4 regions of low dry spell frequencies correspond to regions of high wet spell frequencies and vice versa for instance the birim sub catchment is found to have the maximum frequency for all wet spell lengths in the 2 3 day wet spell fig 5a the maximum frequency is 14 events meanwhile the southernmost of the entire catchment experience about 6 to 8 events at the same spell length the offin sub catchment on the other hand has a frequency ranging between 9 to 12 events the 4 5 day spell fig 5b is found to have a minimum of a day at the immediate outlet to 6 events at the northwestern region of the catchment the southwest to northeast track of the 2 3 and 4 6 dry spell lengths in fig 4a b is also evident in fig 5a b which imply the maximum minimum areas of the short spell lengths the 6 9 day wet spell fig 5c has less than 2 events and almost non existent at the immediate south of the catchment from fig 5d the occurrence of the 10 20 day wet spell length is less than a day which implies that the longer duration spells also hardly occur at the entire pra catchment 4 2 seasonal variation of spells figs 6 and 8 show the mean seasonal variation of dry and wet spells of different lengths from 1981 to 2019 the seasons are december to february djf march to may mam june to august jja and september to november son 4 2 1 dry spells the 2 3 day dry spells are shown to be highest during djf fig 6a with the least spell frequency in mam fig 6b at the entire pra catchment the period of djf fig 6a has spell lengths increasing southward to the main pra sub catchment and with the least frequency of less than 4 days at the northwest of the catchment in mam fig 6b the lowest frequency as opposed to the djf fig 6a is concentrated at the low to middle portion of the pra catchment although lower than the djf fig 6a the extreme south still observes the highest spell frequency between 5 to 6 events during jja fig 6c the maximum frequency is located at the south of the catchment with a lower and upper range between 5 and 8 events in son fig 6d minimum frequency of 2 3 day dry spells can be observed at the northeast birim sub catchment with moderate and highest frequency at the extreme south and north west offin sub catchment of the catchment respectively the 4 6 day dry spell is shown in fig 6e h trends in mam fig 6f for this duration is similar to that of fig 6b but with lower frequency the lowest frequencies fig 6f are non occurring isolated events at the northeast of the catchment a major portion of the offin sub catchment especially the northwest has on average around 2 events in mam fig 6f similarly in djf the minimum frequency of 4 6 dry spells is scattered over the catchment fig 6e with less than 2 events the dry spell frequency during son fig 6h follows a similar pattern with the mam the birim sub catchment observed the least frequency of less than 1 the frequency at the south also observes around 3 to 4 events of dry spell and 2 to 3 events northward fig 6h for jja fig 6g relatively moderate frequency of less than 2 events can be found for the upper pra catchment in the 7 15 day dry spells fig 6i l maximum and minimum over the pra catchment is observed in jja fig 6k and mam fig 6j respectively in djf fig 6i maximum greater than 2 events is shown at the offin sub catchment with less than 2 events at the south for mam fig 6j there is hardly any occurrence of the 7 15 day dry spell length for the entire catchment jja fig 6k observed increasing north south gradient whereas there is no event at the birim sub catchment in son fig 6l the longest duration spell 16 21 days in fig 6m q also reveal a similar spatial variability as in fig 6i l significant features are found only during djf fig 6m and jja fig 6p where the 16 21 day dry spells have approximately 1 to 2 events in djf fig 6m the regions of higher dry spells are located at the northwest of the catchment and the south in jja fig 6p for djf fig 6m the lowest spell frequency has a south to north eastern track thus spreading over the areas where forested and mountainous ranges exist 4 2 2 seasonal variation in wet days fig 7 shows the average number of rainy or wet days within the season we observed that the total number for the seasons varied between 3 to 28 days the djf months contributed the lowest to the total wet days with less than 10 days for the entire catchment however only the northern most region of the catchment has wet days lower than five 5 days by mam fig 7 the number of wet days increase between 10 to 25 days higher wet days are observed at the south approximately 25 days of the catchment the inland areas have a relatively low number of wet days approximately 10 to 28 in response to the northward migration of the inter tropical discontinuity itd in jja fig 7 number of wet days varies from 13 to 25 days for the entire catchment with the upper limit favouring the south the middle to northern areas of the catchment has moderate to high wet days varying between 15 to 23 days by son fig 7 a high number of wet days are restricted to the tip of the catchment at shama with moderate days of about 20 at the birim offin and upper areas of the main pra sub catchments the wet days fall to a minimum between 10 to 15 days 4 2 3 wet spells seasonal wet spells are observed in fig 8 the 2 3 day wet spells are found to be high in the months of mam fig 8b and the least during djf fig 8a in response to the number of dry days in fig 6 in djf except for occasionally around less than 2 events in the 2 3 day wet spells fig 8a no rains are expected over the catchment as the spell duration increases fig 8e i m for mam the maximum is within 3 to 7 events and located across the entire catchment except for the extreme south which had a lower limit frequency moreover the highest frequency is obtained around the birim sub catchment to the middle and lower parts of the main pra sub catchment at the offin sub catchment the frequency is quite moderate 5 to 6 events in jja fig 8c there is an emergence of minimum frequency less than 2 events at the south whereas the north and especially the mountainous ranges have frequency between 3 to 5 events during son fig 8d moderate frequency is observed mostly at the birim sub catchment with 4 to 5 events and the least also occurring at the extreme south less than 2 events similar to jja fig 8c the frequency of 4 5 day wet spells lasts less than 3 events throughout the months mam shows little spatial variability fig 8f as compared to the 2 3 day wet spells fig 8b beside the differences in magnitude slight variations can be observed in the spatial locations of the minimum and maximum frequency a local maximum about 3 events is observed at the middle section of the catchment during jja fig 8g the frequency increases at the birim sub catchment with the rest of the pra catchment observing relatively moderate frequency of 1 to 2 events and less than an event in son fig 8h in the 6 9 day wet spells for mam fig 8j the birim and middle section of main pra fig 8j observed a single event whereas the southernmost has less than an event the maximum frequency in the 6 9 day wet spell persists at the birim sub catchment in jja fig 8k however at extreme west of the offin sub catchment northwest of the pra catchment the number of events are insignificant for son fig 8l similar to the djf fig 8i the frequency is observed to be very low except at the birim sub catchment where there is a spatial decline in events of significant spells the longest duration wet spells 10 20 day fig 8m q similar to the 16 21 day dry spell fig 6m q have rare occurrence for all months however it is likely for any long duration wet spells to occur around the birim sub catchment in mam and jja fig 8o p 4 3 subseasonal variation in dry and wet spells this section shows results for the contribution of monthly wet and dry spells to the total spells for a particular season the months in focus are march to august representing the onset of the monsoon rainfall season at the catchment and the occurrence of the little dry spell in august resulting from the northward retreat of the rainbelt due to the high number of events in the 2 3 day wet and dry spells the subseasonal analyses focus on this spell length the monthly variability of the dry spell from march to august is shown in fig 9a f for the mam season it is shown from fig 9a c that all months contribute equally to the frequency of the 2 3 day spell duration however there are spatial differences in the entire catchment the single event of the spell is most prominent in march fig 9a and april fig 9b dominating the upper pra catchment whereas at the south the spell frequency increases from about 2 to 3 events the minimum frequency in may fig 9c has a northeasterly track suggesting that the south west to north eastern track of the 2 3 day dry spell found in fig 6b is dictated by the dry spell in may see fig 9c meanwhile for the jja season the mean contribution to the 2 3 day dry spell is driven by august fig 9f with the maximum of 3 events at the extreme south in june fig 9d and july fig 9e the lowest frequency is observed at the north east and south respectively the monthly contribution to the 2 3 day wet spell length is shown in fig 10a f from fig 10a c we observed a relatively higher frequency of wet spells in april and may as the rainy season becomes fully established over the catchment the number of rainy days increases and a corresponding increase in the spells in april and may in jja june fig 10d is observed to contribute most to the wet spells with a frequency greater than 2 events as opposed to july fig 10e and august fig 10f 4 4 influence of atmospheric divergence on spells 4 4 1 seasonal mean divergence fields on pressure levels fig 11 shows the seasonal divergence convergence dynamics over the pra river catchment at the lower troposphere 1000 hpa and 850 hpa the middle troposphere 500 hpa and the upper troposphere 200 hpa the djf from fig 11a shows a surface convergence at the south close to the coast and upper of the catchment calm southwesterly winds dominate the catchment at the surface with divergence in the middle section the increasingly high elevation traversing north of the catchment makes the divergence chart at the 850 hpa most suitable for analysing the atmospheric dynamics inland weak convergence with relatively strong north easterlies are observed at the southern most of the catchment along the kwahu plateau and lake bosomtwe fig 11e accordingly at the 500 hpa fig 11i two divergent cores are observed to be located at the east and west of the catchment respectively strong upper level winds with convergence over the entire catchment can be observed at the 200 hpa fig 11m the month of march marks the onset of rainfall within the catchment according to amekudzi et al 2015 the onset of the rains usually begins in the second or third dekad of march for ghana s coastal and forest regions we observed the inflow of relatively stronger southwesterly winds during the mam season at the surface level with a slight spatial extent in the convergence at the south of the catchment fig 11b as compared to djf at the 850 hpa level fig 11f the catchment varies between a weak divergence to strong convergence at the mountainous ranges moisture inflow although south easterlies with some moisture are relatively weak at the 850 hpa level regardless of the location of calm winds at 850 hpa over the higher elevations varying topography directly influences the strength of the convergence at this level at the mid level fig 11j a dry punch exists resulting from the north easterly winds and associated dynamics the existence of the dry punch as stated by parker 2017 strengthens the formation of deep convection as rain is re evaporated into the upper atmosphere to enhance storm formation maintenance organisation and intensity the 200 hpa divergence chart for mam fig 11n shows an opposite spatial variation as the 500 hpa however the areas of deep divergence at 500 hpa is found to have weak convergence at the 200 hpa winds at the upper level are also south easterlies with a southerly curvature at the north of the catchment during jja fig 11c o wind strength increase for the calm areas at the lower tropospheric levels a strong convergence exists at the surface level 1000 hpa with a slight northward spatial extent at the lower pra region fig 11c at 850 hpa fig 11g the region of maximum convergence observed in mam fig 11f over the high elevation intensifies the rest of the catchment has relatively weak to strong divergence at the eastern portion of the catchment westerlies track the region with weak intensity at 500 hpa fig 11k the region of convergence at the north east found in the djf fig 11i and mam fig 11j has a wider spatial extent at the upper levels fig 11o strong easterlies exist as opposed to the strong westerlies in djf fig 11m strong upper level divergence again is restricted to the northernmost of the catchment similar to mam fig 11n the son months mark the southward retreat of the itd and the minor rainy season at the catchment surface winds fig 11d are found to be south westerlies at the south of the catchment similar to mam fig 11b whereas calm winds are observed at the north at 850 hpa fig 11h the northeasterly trade winds are already observed to be present at the catchment relatively strong divergence core exists at the north east of the catchment the 500 hpa fig 11l shows strong divergence over the entire pra catchment the deep divergence core located at the north east of the catchment is observed to persist at 200 hpa fig 11p winds are also north easterlies and a convergence core replaces the strong divergence core found at the 500 hpa fig 11l 4 4 2 seasonal mean vertically integrated moisture divergence vimd and total column water tcw fig 12 shows the seasonal divergence of vimd at the pra catchment during djf a dipole of moisture divergence is observed and less moisture converges at the upper pra from a strong moisture divergence at the lower pra the weak convergence may be due to the micro climate activities found around the major tributaries especially the offin river at the pra catchment the moisture divergence over the catchment is also expected due to the establishment of a high pressure system over the catchment that results in dry dusty and cold north easterly winds from the sahara into the region in mam fig 12 moisture convergence at the upper pra increases as the influx from the gulf of guinea increase a different spatial variation in moisture divergence is observe during jja the magnitude of convergence divergence weakens over the entire catchment in jja fig 12 with low moisture diverging at the middle of the catchment and converging at the upper and southern regions the weakened moisture transport in jja may be due to the strength of wind that are present during these months in son fig 12 the amount of moisture converging is relatively similar to the mam in conclusion the magnitude of moisture convergence divergence at the pra catchment intensifies during the months of onset and cessation of rains and weakens during peak rainfall and little dry spell months in jja the seasonal mean of tcw is observed in fig 13 moisture content is low 40 mm at the upper pra and relatively moderate 40 45 mm at the south due to the proximity to the gulf of guinea in djf fig 13 during mam fig 13 moisture increases to about 55 mm at the south and 45 50 mm at the north of the catchment as the monsoon season becomes established and prevailing winds are moisture laden south westerlies the moisture content declines slightly to 45 50 mm in jja as the itd migrates further northward away from the pra catchment in son moderate moisture about 44 45 mm is observed over the north mountainous ranges of the catchment and 45 47 mm at the middle to lower pra 4 4 3 seasonal composite analysis of divergence vimd and tcw of 2 3 day dry and wet spells fig 14 shows the seasonal composite mean of the divergence for 2 3 day dry and wet spells for simplicity the pressure levels chosen are the lower 850 hpa and middle 500 hpa troposphere in djf weak southerly dry spell fig 14a and south easterly wet spell fig 14e winds prevail over the catchment at the lower level the weak winds limit the moisture influx to the catchment the air in dry spell fig 14 converges at the south and upper boundary of the catchment while diverging inland in the wet spell fig 14e the divergence occurs at the south while converging strongly inland especially in the north west and mountainous regions at 500 hpa strong south easterlies prevail fig 14i m unlike the easterlies in the climatology in fig 11i the magnitude of divergence convergence of air at 500 hpa therefore plays a crucial role in whether a 2 3 day dry or wet spell would occur for instance strong convergence is observed at the 500 hpa at the north west of the catchment fig 14m similar to the 850 hpa fig 14e which supports the wet spell frequency on the other hand divergence over the inner catchment in the dry spell has a corresponding strong divergence over almost the entire catchment at 500 hpa the expulsion of moisture at 500 hpa serves as a cap which is favourable for dryness to occur from mam to son conditions are favourable for the rainfall processes as the summer monsoon is established the wind structure plays a significant role in the 2 3 day dry and wet spells at the lower and middle troposphere during the dry spell occurrence in mam strong north easterlies are present over the entire catchment at 850 hpa fig 14b at 500 hpa there is a composite of weak north and south easterlies fig 14j in the wet spell prevailing winds at the lower level are south westerly with extremely strong south easterlies at the middle troposphere fig 14f both wind directions during the wet spell advect moisture into the catchment for rain formation the strong wind speeds at 500 hpa also imply an increased amount of moisture advection fig 14n in jja wind direction shifts to south easterlies at 850 hpa dry spell fig 14c and very strong north easterlies at 500 hpa fig 14k for the wet spell the magnitude of southerly winds increases inland at the lower level fig 14g an anticyclonic cyclonic circulation is observed over the areas with strong divergence convergence at the lower upper pra respectively at 500 hpa fig 14o in son dry air dominate for each spell at both the 850 hpa fig 14d and 500 hpa fig 14l however the winds for wet periods are stronger at the lower level fig 14h and propagate parallel at the middle troposphere fig 14p the convergence at 850 hpa for the wet spell is stronger than the dry spell in which divergence occurs in most parts of the catchment the seasonal composite of vimd is shown in fig 15 for djf in dry spell fig 15a higher moisture diverges at the lower region of the pra and weakly converges at the upper pra in djf wet spells fig 15e a significant part of the catchment observes convergence of moisture which indicates the presence of rainfall interestingly during the onset and cessation months mam and son of the west african monsoon the vimd for 2 3 day dry spell shows a convergence over the entire catchment sufficient moisture is available for rainfall in mam fig 15b and son fig 15d as compared to jja fig 15c the moisture convergence in mam is stronger at the northwest offin sub catchment of the pra catchment in the wet spells during the monsoon there is a weak moisture divergence at the south of the catchment in mam fig 15f with a corresponding convergence at the upper pra jja wet spell fig 15g similar to jja dry spell fig 15c observes a total convergence over the entire catchment however differences can be found in the strength of the wet spell jja composite where moisture converges strongly at the south of the catchment for the minor rainy season and cessation months son the catchment is engulfed with a relatively strong moisture divergence with a relatively strong convergence around the bosomtwe lake fig 15h standardisation of the tcw gives a comprehensive view of the amount of moisture divergence convergence over the catchment for the 2 3 day dry and wet spells the composite of the standardised anomaly is found in fig 16 in djf dry spell composite fig 16a moisture at the south of the catchment is found to be normal but increases to about 0 2 standard deviations above normal at the extreme north of the catchment on the other hand for the converging moisture found in djf wet spell in fig 15e the associated total column moisture anomaly is about 1 standard deviation above the normal fig 16e this implies that moisture content increases during the dry season djf when wet spells occur as shown in fig 15 for the monsoon months there is moisture convergence during the dry spell however the moisture content is anomalously low during mam fig 16b and more prominent at the south of the catchment in jja fig 16c and son fig 16d above normal moisture conditions do exist however they may be insufficient in hand with other atmospheric processes for rainfall formation for the wet spell composites of the monsoon months fig 16f h total column water is anomalously high about 1 2 standard deviations above the normal the anomaly is highest in jja and mam as compared to son 4 5 spatio temporal variability in projected wet and dry spells 4 5 1 dry spells under rcps fig 17 shows the variability of dry spells for different spell lengths for rcp2 6 fig 17a d g j rcp4 5 fig 17b e h k and rcp8 5 fig 17c f i l from 2029 to 2099 the frequencies of dry spells at all lengths are expected to increase compared to the historic as observed in fig 4 in comparison low frequency in 2 3 day dry spell under rcp2 6 is expected over the entire catchment as compared to rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the projection for 2 3 day dry spells fig 17a c is observed to be highest at the south of the catchment with about 29 events under rcp4 5 and 32 under rcp8 5 fig 17b c inland areas on the other hand are expected to experience less spatial variability with most areas obtaining less than 28 events for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in the 4 6 fig 17d f day dry spell a spatial variability is expected under rcp2 6 fig 17d as the 2 3 day spell fig 17a rcp2 6 shows maximum southern peak at 24 to 25 events moreover commencing from the 4 6 fig 17d f to the 16 21 fig 17l j day dry spell maximum spell frequency under all rcps is located at the south of the catchment at the north of the catchment the frequency gradient decreases the frequency of the 16 21 days fig 17g i is expected to be homogenous inland under rcp2 6 fig 17j and 4 5 fig 17k but with high variability under rcp8 5 fig 17l 4 5 2 wet spells under rcps the magnitude wet spell lengths under the rcps fig 18 is expected to be about two to three times that of the historic period fig 5 for 2 3 day wet spells the magnitude is expected to increase from 6 to 14 events fig 5 to 28 to 34 events fig 18a c areas to be affected with low frequency of about 31 events are the south and birim sub catchment for rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 fig 18a c under rcp4 5 the minimum frequency is at the offin sub catchment the 4 5 day wet spell which was observed to be low at the south and higher inland fig 5b for the baseline is expected to be reversed spatially under the rcps fig 18d f rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 fig 18d e observes low frequency inland with magnitude less than 13 events meanwhile for rcp8 5 the birim sub catchment has a moderate event of around 15 fig 18f the 6 9 day wet spell length fig 18g i is observed to have quite similar frequency to the 4 5 day spells fig 18d f however with a minimal lower limit for the former for all rcps spatial similarities exist for the entire catchment but moderate events of 8 to 10 are expected at the northeast of the catchment under rcp4 5 fig 18h and rcp8 5 fig 18i these moderate spell frequency in the northeast of the catchment in rcp2 6 is expected to be less than 8 events under rcp4 5 and 8 5 fig 18k l for 10 20 day wet spell lengths similar spatio temporal frequency is observed however moving inland long duration spell events diminishes 5 discussions for the rain fed agricultural system such as that found at the pra catchment knowledge of wet and dry spell variations and their frequencies over seasonal and annual timescales are essential assets the propagation of atmospheric wave activities mostly influences the wet and dry spell frequency of different duration for instance the 2 3 4 5 and 6 9 day wet spells are known to be associated with the propagation of the african easterly waves whereas the 10 20 day wet spells are linked to the coupled land atmosphere interaction in the west african monsoon rainfall e g froidurot and diedhiou 2017 these waves could enhance or suppress convection leading to storms depending on their proximity and location to the african easterly jet axis parker 2017 from figs 4 and 5 short duration spells are observed to be highest over the catchment the short duration wet spell is likely to increase during the rainy season from march to november in contrast the long duration dry spell length 16 21 is likely to occur during the dry harmattan period extending from december to february on the other hand dense evergreen forest and perennial crops may be partly responsible for the low high frequency in the dry wet spells of short duration at the central to north east of the pra catchment therefore the land surface dynamics play a key role in influencing the climate at the micro to macro scales the low lying southern most part of the catchment has a lower chance of experiencing moderate wet spell duration of 6 9 day possibly due to its low lying topography as well as the landuse dynamics the frequency of dry and wet spells aid agricultural practices within the catchment at the upper pra since the short duration dry spells incorporated in short duration wet spells provide sufficient time for moisture infiltration into the soil for plant use thus the soil is neither over nor under saturated for plants to utilise in proper growth a prominent factor that primarily dictates the rainfall pattern is the north south oscillation of the inter tropical discontinuity itd the high frequency of the short duration dry and wet spells on the seasonal timescale shows that these are the main contributors to annual rainy and dry days although mam and son are rainy months the least frequency of 2 3 day dry spells is observed in mam as the number of rainy days increases due to the northward migration of the itd furthermore the convergence zone southward retreat during son results in an increasing decreasing frequency in dry and wet spells respectively the reduction increase in dry wet spell length during mam and son can also be inferred from the seasonal wet days where the former has a higher number of wet days as compared to the latter an increasing frequency in the short wet spell duration at the catchment from mam especially april favours the onset of the growing period by providing sufficient amount of moisture to support crop growth after a period of a dry spell in djf the south towards the coast of the catchment 2 3 day wet spell duration observed a low frequency of less than 2 days in jja and son this low frequency has also been observed by bichet and diedhiou 2018 who found the reduction in spell frequency along the coast has favoured more numerous and intense isolated wet days while djf comprises of only dry months the month of november usually represents the cessation of rainfall in the south which implies that increasing dry days in november can negatively impact the wet day conditions at the south during son similarly in august the little dry spell casts cloudy conditions over the catchment with little to no rain occurrence therefore august s little dryness can play a critical role in reducing the number of wet spells especially those of short duration at the catchment during jja froidurot and diedhiou 2017 observed such dryness along the guinea coast in august as the number of wet spells reduced considerably however per figs 9 and 10e f this dryness s contribution possibly begins in july with more isolated wet days meanwhile the moderate to low frequency in wet spells during son as a minor rainy season means that rainfall may result from a higher frequency of isolated rainy wet days than consecutive wet days from the variability of wet days at the catchment there is a possible contribution of isolated rainfall events to the seasonal wet spells in the face of imminent climate change the rcps project a double or triple in the frequency of wet and dry spell lengths this increase is likely to result in extreme conditions such as drought and flooding for a catchment which has been the hotspot for anthropogenic activities such as illegal mining without land reclamation deforestation for urban expansion and indiscriminate timber logging for construction purposes these spell frequencies would be problematic in the future most importantly these climate extremes would be exacerbated by the increase in the medium to long duration wet and dry spells coupled with plausible scenarios of changes in projected landuse as undertaken by awotwi et al 2018 the agricultural sector and all other socio economic activities are expected to be affected by the increase in wet and dry spells for agricultural purposes these extremes can be constrained to rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 by undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment and implementing a strict adaptation and mitigation plan at least in the long term at the catchment divergence and convergence of air play a critical role in forming deep and shallow convection during the wet monsoon season over the catchment and west africa as a whole a low level convergence with a corresponding upper level divergence favours deep convective systems while low level convergence with mid level divergence favours shallow convection according to parker 2017 deep convective cells can quickly be suppressed if there is divergence with an anticyclonic streamlines curvature at the 925 hpa and 850 hpa with a corresponding cyclonic circulation at the 200 hpa level the amount of rainfall in both cases differs with higher quantities during deep convective cases the formation of these convective systems also depends on sufficient moisture availability favourable wind direction and a lift mechanism to advect moisture from the surface to the upper troposphere parker 2017 for instance during mam a strong convergence exists at the immediate south at the 1000 hpa because it is of a lower elevation nevertheless at 850 hpa convergence is prominent and strong especially over the northern sector of the catchment where there are orographic effects accordingly the divergence at the upper levels at 200 hpa is also found to be strong suggesting a zone of deep convection at the north of the catchment during mam the consequences of the convergence divergence dynamics in mam at the entire catchment enhance the number of rainy days and increase wet spell frequency for the short duration spells in these months as observed in fig 8 in jja the lower upper level convergence divergence is restricted to the upper pra only resulting in a higher frequency of short duration wet spell over the region the south westerly winds ensures the advection of sufficient moisture to the catchment which is lifted to upper levels due to the convergence the vertically integrated moisture divergence vimd indicates the rate of moisture influx into and out of a region in this case the moisture is integrated from the top of the atmosphere to the surface copernicus climate change service c3s 2017 in djf although moisture converges over the north western part of the pra catchment the total amount of moisture associated is low 40 mm see fig 13 moist airmass may diverge from the south due to its proximity to the sea to inland areas in mam substantial moisture divergence is located at the confluence of the two major tributaries offin and birim to the main pra river the intense insolation reaching the surface within this period leading to the onset of rain could contribute to the high moisture content over the confluence which is advected to the north west of the catchment the moisture transport is shown form the south easterly direction of winds at the 850 hpa and 200 hpa with the strong anticyclonic curvature in mam from fig 11 the moisture advection process in mam aids in establishing and maintaining the higher wet spell frequency observed during this period at the entire catchment over mountainous areas the constant low total moisture content in son may result from increased rainfall at the mountain s base wypych et al 2018 in the 2 3 day wet spell divergence composite in mam the south easterly winds at 500 hpa fig 14f increases moisture content which can be observed in the higher tcw fig 16f in jja the anticyclonic circulation at 500 hpa fig 14o induces a ridge from the south east to the north west of the catchment which coupled with the low level southerlies at 850 hpa fig 14g supports the formation of rainfall during the wet spell also the importance of moisture in regulating dry spells can be observed in the composites of vimd and tcw for instance regardless of the strong magnitude of convergence over the entire catchment from mam to son during dry spells fig 15b d the corresponding tcw ranges from normal to below normal especially during mam fig 16b d which favours the occurrence of dry spells however for wet spells the dipole of divergence and convergence over the catchment is essential in increasing moisture content to above normal levels fig 15e h for rainfall initiation in jja wet spell the stronger convergence at the south of the catchment may be favourable for the spell frequency fig 15g the increase in moisture in djf during the wet spell fig 16e usually results from the interaction of the itd with the mid latitude trough in a tongue like structure this trough draws the itd a few kilometres north from its normal position south during this period in turn the northward propagation of the itd favours unusual dry season moisture advection into the catchment and rainfall enhancement 6 conclusions knowledge in the spatio temporal distribution of wet and dry spells is crucial for the rain fed agricultural system found at the pra river catchment in recent years the catchment has been characterised by rapid urbanisation deforestation and mining activities without land reclamation which poses a threat to the climate and hydrology this study investigated the variability of wet and dry spells and associated atmospheric dynamics at the catchment from 1981 to 2019 specifically we studied the spell frequency of different duration and wet days at different timescales and under rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 furthermore the study investigated the influence of atmospheric dynamics on the seasonal rainfall and spell composites at the catchment the study used the chirps data and a 1 mm threshold of rainfall to distinguish between rainy and non rainy days wet and dry spells were separated into four categories each with the former comprising of 2 3 4 5 6 9 and 10 20 days while the latter consisted of 2 3 4 6 7 15 and 16 21 days seasonal 2 3 day wet and dry spell composites of the atmospheric dynamics in divergence vertical integrated moisture divergence and total column water from era5 were also employed the study results showed that the short duration wet 2 3 4 5 and dry spells 2 3 4 6 were the most frequent at the pra catchment on both the annual and seasonal timescales the frequency for 2 3 day wet and dry spells were highest at the south with less than 9 events and greater than 21 events respectively on the seasonal timescale short duration dry wet spells were at a maximum minimum during djf and minimum maximum in the months of mam on the subseasonal timescale in the 2 3 day wet spells the contribution of may and june were highest for mam and jja respectively under the three rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 from 2029 to 2099 an increase in both wet and dry spells is expected as compared to the baseline period the frequency in the spells is expected to be highest in rcp8 5 and least in rcp2 6 the seasonal divergence analyses also revealed a strong convergence at the lower levels 850 hpa during mam over the entire catchment with a corresponding strong divergence at the upper levels 200 hpa which supports deep convection during the onset of the rains during jja convergence was restricted to the mountainous regions at the lower levels whereas divergence exists over the same regions at the upper levels only vertical integrated moisture divergence is strongest at the lower catchment during djf with near total convergence over the entire catchment in jja total column moisture content increases 45 mm from mam to son to support rainfall activities composites of 2 3 day dry and wet spells showed that a dipole of moisture convergence and divergence over the catchment is vital for increasing tcw to above normal levels favouring the wet spells in djf to son on the other hand total moisture convergence over the catchment in mam to son are favourable for dry spells with corresponding normal to below normal amounts in tcw finally strong south easterlies at 500 hpa in mam establishment of a ridge from an anticyclonic circulation at same pressure level in jja along with low level southerlies at 850 in jja also act to support wet spell occurrences due to time and computational constraints a few limitation exist in this study climate change analyses need to use the ensemble mean of climate projection data and different climate projection models for this study a single ensemble r1i1p1 under each rcp was used from a single climate model mpi esm mr hence in future analysis it would be useful to incorporate more than one ensemble and climate model to reduce projection biases and give a comprehensive view of spells over the pra catchment besides this study showed the composite of atmospheric controls for only the 2 3 day dry and wet spells the atmospheric conditions over the catchment also needs to be understood for the moderate and long duration spells nonetheless the results obtained from this study gives a new perspective into the spell distribution and variability within the pra catchment the study contributes a piece of essential information to aid water resource management and agriculture the spell variability serves as an informed platform to factor irrigation mechanisms to boost crop farming in the catchment regionally the potential increase in wet spell frequency is likely to result in increasing flooding activities at the catchment the study therefore improves understanding of the land atmosphere interaction on the micro macro climate at the regional scale author contributions

8270,study region the pra river catchment in ghana west africa study focus knowledge of the spatio temporal distribution of wet and dry spells are crucial for rain fed agriculture at the pra river catchment this study characterised spells and their associated atmospheric dynamics at the pra river catchment specifically the variability of historical and future wet and dry spells and atmospheric dynamics on the rainfall and spell patterns at the catchment were studied new hydrological insights short duration spells have a higher occurrence at the catchment as compared to long duration spells seasonally short duration dry spells are most common in december february whereas wet spells are expected in march may future scenarios show an increase in both wet and dry spells composites of the atmospheric dynamics for 2 3 day dry spells show moisture convergence over the entire catchment with lower total column water levels however there is a dipole of moisture convergence and divergence

temporal variability owusu and waylen 2013 bibi et al 2014 inter annual to decadal and multi decadal changes in rainfall pattern have been observed which has negatively affected the amount of water needed to support the dominant rain fed agricultural practices baidu et al 2017 these changes have been linked to the atmospheric dynamics nicholson 1979 2000 2001 nicholson and paloa 1993 eltahir and gong 1996 the effect of coupled modes such as enso and other tele connections ronghui and yifang 1989 lare and nicholson 1994 diaz et al 2001 gergis and fowler 2009 changes in land use dynamics resulting from anthropogenic invasion pachauri et al 2014 awotwi et al 2017 and climate change and variability pachauri et al 2014 besides the fifth assessment report of the ipcc pachauri et al 2014 observed an increasing trend for extreme rainfall and discharge events in regional scale catchments and suggested a likely increase in the risk of flash floods schmidli and frei 2005 also observed that the recent occurrences in rainfall extremities have gradually increased in the 20th century as possible response to global climate change knowledge in the spatio temporal distribution of wet and dry spells is crucial for determining of rainfall onset cessation and length of the growing season in the face of current climate change and variability these spells are closely linked to the water balance at the local scale and serve as the best proxies for determining crop water stress and timing froidurot and diedhiou 2017 for instance an extreme rainfall event incorporated within an existing long wet period is likely to result in worse damages due to antecedent wet conditions mandapaka et al 2016 and references therein shorter dry spell duration embedded in more wet days during the growing season are more beneficial to agriculture than an increase of dry days with less but longer duration dry spells yorke et al 2010 bouagila and sushama 2013 furthermore large scale atmospheric dynamics which drive the rainfall patterns over the tropics influence the duration of various wet and dry spell lengths of a region for instance singh et al 2014 found that changes in extremely dry and wet spells in india are the consequences of increases in convective available potential energy low level moisture convergence and large scale circulation changes aloft in the atmosphere therefore an integration of atmospheric dynamics in the characterisation and effects of spells over a region will enhance the knowledge and prediction of wet and dry spells and provide policy makers with more reliable tools in ghana the variability of dry spells during the rainy season has been observed to be higher in the south than the north yorke et al 2010 logah et al 2013 a shortening rainy season with longer duration of dry spells in hand with extreme weather events have been reported in northern ghana rademacher schulz et al 2014 and references therein a result which would have dire consequences on food security and water resource management logah et al 2013 further discovered that although average rainfall amounts in ghana had begun to increase from 1981 to 2010 its rate is instead on a decline at 8 6 1991 2000 to 2 6 2001 2010 contrarily manzanas et al 2014 observed a decreasing increasing trend of precipitation for the first second half for the years 1961 1985 1986 2010 hence understanding of these variability gives a piece of first hand information on the design of early warning systems and other hydro agricultural infrastructures froidurot and diedhiou 2017 the pra catchment is the second largest in ghana and has a population of about five million and an annual growth rate of 2 2 water resource commission 2012 in recent times the catchment has attracted research interest resulting from increased human activities such as active deforestation to accommodate illegal mining activities these activities have resulted in changes in the land cover and consequently altered the hydrologic cycle and macro climate of the catchment according to awotwi et al 2018 between 1986 2016 the land degradation at the pra catchment has undergone six different phases with settlement cropland and mining activities obtaining increment rates of 130 198 and 304 respectively the consequences of this is a statistically significant decreasing trend in post cessation and pre onset of rains in february and march for the entire catchment awotwi et al 2017 mayeem 2017 observed that deforestation and land degradation were the environmental footprints of changes in land use cover owing to the increase in surface mining at the birim north district a sub catchment of the pra river catchment awotwi et al 2019 also focused on modelling the water balance at the pra catchment and found a reduction in surface runoff and water yield during the dry season and increased baseflow and evapotranspiration during the wet season between 1986 to 2016 only a few rainfall studies so far has been reported in the pra catchment owusu and waylen 2009 manzanas et al 2014 awotwi et al 2017 these studies have observed an increasing trend in annual rainfall totals from 1986 to 2015 the water resource commission of ghana in 2012 provided an integrated water resources management plan for the pra catchment which focused on the understanding of the water resource potential through water availability utilisation quality and demand water resource commission 2012 however studies on the characteristics of rainfall in the catchment have been absent this study characterised wet and dry spells and associated atmospheric dynamics at the pra catchment to improve our understanding of the rainfall dynamics the variability of wet and dry spells of different

ocean and land surface through the exchange of energy momentum water and carbon dioxide giorgetta et al 2013 the coupling between the various climate systems depends mainly on these surface fluxes and computed at atmospheric time step based on the atmosphere s actual state and the ocean s mean state at the last coupling interval the daily mean flux of precipitation over land is interpolated onto a 0 5 0 5 grid for river catchments the mixed resolution mr configuration of the model has higher vertical and horizontal resolutions in the atmosphere and ocean respectively giorgetta et al 2013 daily projection rainfall data from 2029 to 2099 and historical data spanning 1984 to 2005 from the mpi esm mr were obtained from https esgf data dkrz de projects esgf dkrz a single ensemble r1i1p1 each for three representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were employed in this study due to computational limitations over west africa mpi esm mr simulates the monsoon s dynamics very well kebe et al 2017 heinzeller et al 2018 agyekum et al 2018 zebaze et al 2019 with excellent correlation to observations sow et al 2020 3 2 2 comparison of bias correction methods the r package hyfo xu 2018 due to its flexibility on gridded datasets was used for bias correcting the chirps and mpi esm mr rainfall datasets three algorithms including the linear multiplicative scaling empirical quantile method eqm and gamma quantile method gqm were applied on the datasets the description of these methods can be found in teutschbein and seibert 2012 from fig 3 it can be observed that the linear multiplicative scaling method provides a reasonable estimate of the spatio temporal distribution in the historical chirps data as compared to eqm and gqm although eqm and gqm captures some spatial variabilities rainfall amounts are extremely over estimated this implies that for mpi esm mr projection rainfall datasets the linear multiplicative scaling method is most appropriate 3 3 analysis procedure the seasonal and annual frequency of wet and dry spells for this study s baseline period 1981 2019 were extracted from the chirps dataset for the pra catchment we set a threshold of 1 mm to distinguish between rainy and non rainy days as used in studies such as sivakumar 1992 yorke et al 2010 rademacher schulz et al 2014 froidurot and diedhiou 2017 and bichet and diedhiou 2018 therefore a wet dry spell occurs when there is a consecutive number of rainy non rainy days followed by non rainy rainy days in the present study the wet spells used are the 2 3 4 5 and 6 9 which follow the propagation of the african easterly waves and 10 20 day wet spells resulting from the african monsoon rainfall froidurot and diedhiou 2017 the duration of 2 3 4 6 7 15 and 16 21 were used for the dry spell analysis the seasonal wet days were extracted from the chirps data for the catchment and the 39 year mean of each seasonal spell computed the seasonal pattern of spells was split into three months of four quarters in a year december january and february djf march april and may mam june july and august jja and september october and november son after that sub seasonal analyses of selected months contributions to the wet and dry spell climatology were performed similarly the frequency of the wet and dry spell lengths was extracted on the annual timescale under the various rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 after bias correcting both historical and projection simulations mpi esm mr with the chirps datasets the atmospheric processes influence on the seasonal timescale at the catchment was assessed using the divergence field at four pressure levels 1000 hpa 850 hpa 500 hpa and 200 hpa the seasonal mean wind fields were analysed and superimposed on the divergence fields at various pressure levels to determine the wind speed and direction the seasonal mean of vertically integrated moisture divergence vimd and total water column tcw at the catchment was used to determine the region s moisture convergence and divergence including the availability of liquid water cloud ice and rain in a column extending from boundary layer to the top of the atmosphere we performed further analyses on the 2 3 day wet and dry spells by extracting similar days in which the spells occurred at about 90 of the grids by this composite anomaly analysis of tcw was computed on the extracted days however for extracted days of the divergence wind and vimd the anomaly was not calculated on the composites instead the average over the days is computed to preserve the areas of convergence and divergence of moisture we ensured that both datasets era5 and mpi esm mr were downscaled to the grid size resolution of chirps before analysis 4 results 4 1 annual climatology of spells the dry spells for the duration of 2 3 4 6 7 15 and 16 21 days are shown in fig 4 it is observed that shorter duration dry spells 2 3 and 4 6 day spells are most frequent in the pra catchment the 2 3 day spells fig 4a have a maximum frequency of about 27 and a minimum of about 18 a higher frequency of the 2 3 day is observed at the south of the catchment from its outlet at shama the mountainous and forested areas found at the middle and northeastern part of the catchment had 2 3 day spells which are lower less than 20 events possibly due to topographic influence microclimate enhancement in enhancing rainfall to the north and north west of the catchment the 2 3 day spell frequency has a reasonable period of between 20 to 22 events the 4 6 day dry spell lengths usually have frequency varying between 9 to 15 fig 4b the area characterised by lowest frequency in the 2 3 day dry spell shifts entirely to the north east of the catchment birim sub catchment in the 4 6 day dry spell with the maximum 13 15 frequency observed at the outlet of the catchment additionally a new maximum of about 11 to 12 events emerges north west offin sub catchment of the catchment in the 4 6 day dry spell the 7 15 day dry spell length is shown in fig 4c and a decrease in dry spell frequency 4 to maximum 7 events is observed the offin sub catchment is found to be susceptible to the influence of moderate frequency dry spells under the 7 15 day spell length the location of minimum spell frequency at the birim sub catchment shifts to the higher elevation mountainous ranges see fig 1 a spatial extension of the minima at the birim sub catchment is shown in the 16 21 day dry spell with frequency of about 2 events fig 5 shows the wet spell lengths for 2 3 4 5 6 9 and 10 20 days contrary to observations in fig 4 regions of low dry spell frequencies correspond to regions of high wet spell frequencies and vice versa for instance the birim sub catchment is found to have the maximum frequency for all wet spell lengths in the 2 3 day wet spell fig 5a the maximum frequency is 14 events meanwhile the southernmost of the entire catchment experience about 6 to 8 events at the same spell length the offin sub catchment on the other hand has a frequency ranging between 9 to 12 events the 4 5 day spell fig 5b is found to have a minimum of a day at the immediate outlet to 6 events at the northwestern region of the catchment the southwest to northeast track of the 2 3 and 4 6 dry spell lengths in fig 4a b is also evident in fig 5a b which imply the maximum minimum areas of the short spell lengths the 6 9 day wet spell fig 5c has less than 2 events and almost non existent at the immediate south of the catchment from fig 5d the occurrence of the 10 20 day wet spell length is less than a day which implies that the longer duration spells also hardly occur at the entire pra catchment 4 2 seasonal variation of spells figs 6 and 8 show the mean seasonal variation of dry and wet spells of different lengths from 1981 to 2019 the seasons are december to february djf march to may mam june to august jja and september to november son 4 2 1 dry spells the 2 3 day dry spells are shown to be highest during djf fig 6a with the least spell frequency in mam fig 6b at the entire pra catchment the period of djf fig 6a has spell lengths increasing southward to the main pra sub catchment and with the least frequency of less than 4 days at the northwest of the catchment in mam fig 6b the lowest frequency as opposed to the djf fig 6a is concentrated at the low to middle portion of the pra catchment although lower than the djf fig 6a the extreme south still observes the highest spell frequency between 5 to 6 events during jja fig 6c the maximum frequency is located at the south of the catchment with a lower and upper range between 5 and 8 events in son fig 6d minimum frequency of 2 3 day dry spells can be observed at the northeast birim sub catchment with moderate and highest frequency at the extreme south and north west offin sub catchment of the catchment respectively the 4 6 day dry spell is shown in fig 6e h trends in mam fig 6f for this duration is similar to that of fig 6b but with lower frequency the lowest frequencies fig 6f are non occurring isolated events at the northeast of the catchment a major portion of the offin sub catchment especially the northwest has on average around 2 events in mam fig 6f similarly in djf the minimum frequency of 4 6 dry spells is scattered over the catchment fig 6e with less than 2 events the dry spell frequency during son fig 6h follows a similar pattern with the mam the birim sub catchment observed the least frequency of less than 1 the frequency at the south also observes around 3 to 4 events of dry spell and 2 to 3 events northward fig 6h for jja fig 6g relatively moderate frequency of less than 2 events can be found for the upper pra catchment in the 7 15 day dry spells fig 6i l maximum and minimum over the pra catchment is observed in jja fig 6k and mam fig 6j respectively in djf fig 6i maximum greater than 2 events is shown at the offin sub catchment with less than 2 events at the south for mam fig 6j there is hardly any occurrence of the 7 15 day dry spell length for the entire catchment jja fig 6k observed increasing north south gradient whereas there is no event at the birim sub catchment in son fig 6l the longest duration spell 16 21 days in fig 6m q also reveal a similar spatial variability as in fig 6i l significant features are found only during djf fig 6m and jja fig 6p where the 16 21 day dry spells have approximately 1 to 2 events in djf fig 6m the regions of higher dry spells are located at the northwest of the catchment and the south in jja fig 6p for djf fig 6m the lowest spell frequency has a south to north eastern track thus spreading over the areas where forested and mountainous ranges exist 4 2 2 seasonal variation in wet days fig 7 shows the average number of rainy or wet days within the season we observed that the total number for the seasons varied between 3 to 28 days the djf months contributed the lowest to the total wet days with less than 10 days for the entire catchment however only the northern most region of the catchment has wet days lower than five 5 days by mam fig 7 the number of wet days increase between 10 to 25 days higher wet days are observed at the south approximately 25 days of the catchment the inland areas have a relatively low number of wet days approximately 10 to 28 in response to the northward migration of the inter tropical discontinuity itd in jja fig 7 number of wet days varies from 13 to 25 days for the entire catchment with the upper limit favouring the south the middle to northern areas of the catchment has moderate to high wet days varying between 15 to 23 days by son fig 7 a high number of wet days are restricted to the tip of the catchment at shama with moderate days of about 20 at the birim offin and upper areas of the main pra sub catchments the wet days fall to a minimum between 10 to 15 days 4 2 3 wet spells seasonal wet spells are observed in fig 8 the 2 3 day wet spells are found to be high in the months of mam fig 8b and the least during djf fig 8a in response to the number of dry days in fig 6 in djf except for occasionally around less than 2 events in the 2 3 day wet spells fig 8a no rains are expected over the catchment as the spell duration increases fig 8e i m for mam the maximum is within 3 to 7 events and located across the entire catchment except for the extreme south which had a lower limit frequency moreover the highest frequency is obtained around the birim sub catchment to the middle and lower parts of the main pra sub catchment at the offin sub catchment the frequency is quite moderate 5 to 6 events in jja fig 8c there is an emergence of minimum frequency less than 2 events at the south whereas the north and especially the mountainous ranges have frequency between 3 to 5 events during son fig 8d moderate frequency is observed mostly at the birim sub catchment with 4 to 5 events and the least also occurring at the extreme south less than 2 events similar to jja fig 8c the frequency of 4 5 day wet spells lasts less than 3 events throughout the months mam shows little spatial variability fig 8f as compared to the 2 3 day wet spells fig 8b beside the differences in magnitude slight variations can be observed in the spatial locations of the minimum and maximum frequency a local maximum about 3 events is observed at the middle section of the catchment during jja fig 8g the frequency increases at the birim sub catchment with the rest of the pra catchment observing relatively moderate frequency of 1 to 2 events and less than an event in son fig 8h in the 6 9 day wet spells for mam fig 8j the birim and middle section of main pra fig 8j observed a single event whereas the southernmost has less than an event the maximum frequency in the 6 9 day wet spell persists at the birim sub catchment in jja fig 8k however at extreme west of the offin sub catchment northwest of the pra catchment the number of events are insignificant for son fig 8l similar to the djf fig 8i the frequency is observed to be very low except at the birim sub catchment where there is a spatial decline in events of significant spells the longest duration wet spells 10 20 day fig 8m q similar to the 16 21 day dry spell fig 6m q have rare occurrence for all months however it is likely for any long duration wet spells to occur around the birim sub catchment in mam and jja fig 8o p 4 3 subseasonal variation in dry and wet spells this section shows results for the contribution of monthly wet and dry spells to the total spells for a particular season the months in focus are march to august representing the onset of the monsoon rainfall season at the catchment and the occurrence of the little dry spell in august resulting from the northward retreat of the rainbelt due to the high number of events in the 2 3 day wet and dry spells the subseasonal analyses focus on this spell length the monthly variability of the dry spell from march to august is shown in fig 9a f for the mam season it is shown from fig 9a c that all months contribute equally to the frequency of the 2 3 day spell duration however there are spatial differences in the entire catchment the single event of the spell is most prominent in march fig 9a and april fig 9b dominating the upper pra catchment whereas at the south the spell frequency increases from about 2 to 3 events the minimum frequency in may fig 9c has a northeasterly track suggesting that the south west to north eastern track of the 2 3 day dry spell found in fig 6b is dictated by the dry spell in may see fig 9c meanwhile for the jja season the mean contribution to the 2 3 day dry spell is driven by august fig 9f with the maximum of 3 events at the extreme south in june fig 9d and july fig 9e the lowest frequency is observed at the north east and south respectively the monthly contribution to the 2 3 day wet spell length is shown in fig 10a f from fig 10a c we observed a relatively higher frequency of wet spells in april and may as the rainy season becomes fully established over the catchment the number of rainy days increases and a corresponding increase in the spells in april and may in jja june fig 10d is observed to contribute most to the wet spells with a frequency greater than 2 events as opposed to july fig 10e and august fig 10f 4 4 influence of atmospheric divergence on spells 4 4 1 seasonal mean divergence fields on pressure levels fig 11 shows the seasonal divergence convergence dynamics over the pra river catchment at the lower troposphere 1000 hpa and 850 hpa the middle troposphere 500 hpa and the upper troposphere 200 hpa the djf from fig 11a shows a surface convergence at the south close to the coast and upper of the catchment calm southwesterly winds dominate the catchment at the surface with divergence in the middle section the increasingly high elevation traversing north of the catchment makes the divergence chart at the 850 hpa most suitable for analysing the atmospheric dynamics inland weak convergence with relatively strong north easterlies are observed at the southern most of the catchment along the kwahu plateau and lake bosomtwe fig 11e accordingly at the 500 hpa fig 11i two divergent cores are observed to be located at the east and west of the catchment respectively strong upper level winds with convergence over the entire catchment can be observed at the 200 hpa fig 11m the month of march marks the onset of rainfall within the catchment according to amekudzi et al 2015 the onset of the rains usually begins in the second or third dekad of march for ghana s coastal and forest regions we observed the inflow of relatively stronger southwesterly winds during the mam season at the surface level with a slight spatial extent in the convergence at the south of the catchment fig 11b as compared to djf at the 850 hpa level fig 11f the catchment varies between a weak divergence to strong convergence at the mountainous ranges moisture inflow although south easterlies with some moisture are relatively weak at the 850 hpa level regardless of the location of calm winds at 850 hpa over the higher elevations varying topography directly influences the strength of the convergence at this level at the mid level fig 11j a dry punch exists resulting from the north easterly winds and associated dynamics the existence of the dry punch as stated by parker 2017 strengthens the formation of deep convection as rain is re evaporated into the upper atmosphere to enhance storm formation maintenance organisation and intensity the 200 hpa divergence chart for mam fig 11n shows an opposite spatial variation as the 500 hpa however the areas of deep divergence at 500 hpa is found to have weak convergence at the 200 hpa winds at the upper level are also south easterlies with a southerly curvature at the north of the catchment during jja fig 11c o wind strength increase for the calm areas at the lower tropospheric levels a strong convergence exists at the surface level 1000 hpa with a slight northward spatial extent at the lower pra region fig 11c at 850 hpa fig 11g the region of maximum convergence observed in mam fig 11f over the high elevation intensifies the rest of the catchment has relatively weak to strong divergence at the eastern portion of the catchment westerlies track the region with weak intensity at 500 hpa fig 11k the region of convergence at the north east found in the djf fig 11i and mam fig 11j has a wider spatial extent at the upper levels fig 11o strong easterlies exist as opposed to the strong westerlies in djf fig 11m strong upper level divergence again is restricted to the northernmost of the catchment similar to mam fig 11n the son months mark the southward retreat of the itd and the minor rainy season at the catchment surface winds fig 11d are found to be south westerlies at the south of the catchment similar to mam fig 11b whereas calm winds are observed at the north at 850 hpa fig 11h the northeasterly trade winds are already observed to be present at the catchment relatively strong divergence core exists at the north east of the catchment the 500 hpa fig 11l shows strong divergence over the entire pra catchment the deep divergence core located at the north east of the catchment is observed to persist at 200 hpa fig 11p winds are also north easterlies and a convergence core replaces the strong divergence core found at the 500 hpa fig 11l 4 4 2 seasonal mean vertically integrated moisture divergence vimd and total column water tcw fig 12 shows the seasonal divergence of vimd at the pra catchment during djf a dipole of moisture divergence is observed and less moisture converges at the upper pra from a strong moisture divergence at the lower pra the weak convergence may be due to the micro climate activities found around the major tributaries especially the offin river at the pra catchment the moisture divergence over the catchment is also expected due to the establishment of a high pressure system over the catchment that results in dry dusty and cold north easterly winds from the sahara into the region in mam fig 12 moisture convergence at the upper pra increases as the influx from the gulf of guinea increase a different spatial variation in moisture divergence is observe during jja the magnitude of convergence divergence weakens over the entire catchment in jja fig 12 with low moisture diverging at the middle of the catchment and converging at the upper and southern regions the weakened moisture transport in jja may be due to the strength of wind that are present during these months in son fig 12 the amount of moisture converging is relatively similar to the mam in conclusion the magnitude of moisture convergence divergence at the pra catchment intensifies during the months of onset and cessation of rains and weakens during peak rainfall and little dry spell months in jja the seasonal mean of tcw is observed in fig 13 moisture content is low 40 mm at the upper pra and relatively moderate 40 45 mm at the south due to the proximity to the gulf of guinea in djf fig 13 during mam fig 13 moisture increases to about 55 mm at the south and 45 50 mm at the north of the catchment as the monsoon season becomes established and prevailing winds are moisture laden south westerlies the moisture content declines slightly to 45 50 mm in jja as the itd migrates further northward away from the pra catchment in son moderate moisture about 44 45 mm is observed over the north mountainous ranges of the catchment and 45 47 mm at the middle to lower pra 4 4 3 seasonal composite analysis of divergence vimd and tcw of 2 3 day dry and wet spells fig 14 shows the seasonal composite mean of the divergence for 2 3 day dry and wet spells for simplicity the pressure levels chosen are the lower 850 hpa and middle 500 hpa troposphere in djf weak southerly dry spell fig 14a and south easterly wet spell fig 14e winds prevail over the catchment at the lower level the weak winds limit the moisture influx to the catchment the air in dry spell fig 14 converges at the south and upper boundary of the catchment while diverging inland in the wet spell fig 14e the divergence occurs at the south while converging strongly inland especially in the north west and mountainous regions at 500 hpa strong south easterlies prevail fig 14i m unlike the easterlies in the climatology in fig 11i the magnitude of divergence convergence of air at 500 hpa therefore plays a crucial role in whether a 2 3 day dry or wet spell would occur for instance strong convergence is observed at the 500 hpa at the north west of the catchment fig 14m similar to the 850 hpa fig 14e which supports the wet spell frequency on the other hand divergence over the inner catchment in the dry spell has a corresponding strong divergence over almost the entire catchment at 500 hpa the expulsion of moisture at 500 hpa serves as a cap which is favourable for dryness to occur from mam to son conditions are favourable for the rainfall processes as the summer monsoon is established the wind structure plays a significant role in the 2 3 day dry and wet spells at the lower and middle troposphere during the dry spell occurrence in mam strong north easterlies are present over the entire catchment at 850 hpa fig 14b at 500 hpa there is a composite of weak north and south easterlies fig 14j in the wet spell prevailing winds at the lower level are south westerly with extremely strong south easterlies at the middle troposphere fig 14f both wind directions during the wet spell advect moisture into the catchment for rain formation the strong wind speeds at 500 hpa also imply an increased amount of moisture advection fig 14n in jja wind direction shifts to south easterlies at 850 hpa dry spell fig 14c and very strong north easterlies at 500 hpa fig 14k for the wet spell the magnitude of southerly winds increases inland at the lower level fig 14g an anticyclonic cyclonic circulation is observed over the areas with strong divergence convergence at the lower upper pra respectively at 500 hpa fig 14o in son dry air dominate for each spell at both the 850 hpa fig 14d and 500 hpa fig 14l however the winds for wet periods are stronger at the lower level fig 14h and propagate parallel at the middle troposphere fig 14p the convergence at 850 hpa for the wet spell is stronger than the dry spell in which divergence occurs in most parts of the catchment the seasonal composite of vimd is shown in fig 15 for djf in dry spell fig 15a higher moisture diverges at the lower region of the pra and weakly converges at the upper pra in djf wet spells fig 15e a significant part of the catchment observes convergence of moisture which indicates the presence of rainfall interestingly during the onset and cessation months mam and son of the west african monsoon the vimd for 2 3 day dry spell shows a convergence over the entire catchment sufficient moisture is available for rainfall in mam fig 15b and son fig 15d as compared to jja fig 15c the moisture convergence in mam is stronger at the northwest offin sub catchment of the pra catchment in the wet spells during the monsoon there is a weak moisture divergence at the south of the catchment in mam fig 15f with a corresponding convergence at the upper pra jja wet spell fig 15g similar to jja dry spell fig 15c observes a total convergence over the entire catchment however differences can be found in the strength of the wet spell jja composite where moisture converges strongly at the south of the catchment for the minor rainy season and cessation months son the catchment is engulfed with a relatively strong moisture divergence with a relatively strong convergence around the bosomtwe lake fig 15h standardisation of the tcw gives a comprehensive view of the amount of moisture divergence convergence over the catchment for the 2 3 day dry and wet spells the composite of the standardised anomaly is found in fig 16 in djf dry spell composite fig 16a moisture at the south of the catchment is found to be normal but increases to about 0 2 standard deviations above normal at the extreme north of the catchment on the other hand for the converging moisture found in djf wet spell in fig 15e the associated total column moisture anomaly is about 1 standard deviation above the normal fig 16e this implies that moisture content increases during the dry season djf when wet spells occur as shown in fig 15 for the monsoon months there is moisture convergence during the dry spell however the moisture content is anomalously low during mam fig 16b and more prominent at the south of the catchment in jja fig 16c and son fig 16d above normal moisture conditions do exist however they may be insufficient in hand with other atmospheric processes for rainfall formation for the wet spell composites of the monsoon months fig 16f h total column water is anomalously high about 1 2 standard deviations above the normal the anomaly is highest in jja and mam as compared to son 4 5 spatio temporal variability in projected wet and dry spells 4 5 1 dry spells under rcps fig 17 shows the variability of dry spells for different spell lengths for rcp2 6 fig 17a d g j rcp4 5 fig 17b e h k and rcp8 5 fig 17c f i l from 2029 to 2099 the frequencies of dry spells at all lengths are expected to increase compared to the historic as observed in fig 4 in comparison low frequency in 2 3 day dry spell under rcp2 6 is expected over the entire catchment as compared to rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the projection for 2 3 day dry spells fig 17a c is observed to be highest at the south of the catchment with about 29 events under rcp4 5 and 32 under rcp8 5 fig 17b c inland areas on the other hand are expected to experience less spatial variability with most areas obtaining less than 28 events for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in the 4 6 fig 17d f day dry spell a spatial variability is expected under rcp2 6 fig 17d as the 2 3 day spell fig 17a rcp2 6 shows maximum southern peak at 24 to 25 events moreover commencing from the 4 6 fig 17d f to the 16 21 fig 17l j day dry spell maximum spell frequency under all rcps is located at the south of the catchment at the north of the catchment the frequency gradient decreases the frequency of the 16 21 days fig 17g i is expected to be homogenous inland under rcp2 6 fig 17j and 4 5 fig 17k but with high variability under rcp8 5 fig 17l 4 5 2 wet spells under rcps the magnitude wet spell lengths under the rcps fig 18 is expected to be about two to three times that of the historic period fig 5 for 2 3 day wet spells the magnitude is expected to increase from 6 to 14 events fig 5 to 28 to 34 events fig 18a c areas to be affected with low frequency of about 31 events are the south and birim sub catchment for rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 fig 18a c under rcp4 5 the minimum frequency is at the offin sub catchment the 4 5 day wet spell which was observed to be low at the south and higher inland fig 5b for the baseline is expected to be reversed spatially under the rcps fig 18d f rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 fig 18d e observes low frequency inland with magnitude less than 13 events meanwhile for rcp8 5 the birim sub catchment has a moderate event of around 15 fig 18f the 6 9 day wet spell length fig 18g i is observed to have quite similar frequency to the 4 5 day spells fig 18d f however with a minimal lower limit for the former for all rcps spatial similarities exist for the entire catchment but moderate events of 8 to 10 are expected at the northeast of the catchment under rcp4 5 fig 18h and rcp8 5 fig 18i these moderate spell frequency in the northeast of the catchment in rcp2 6 is expected to be less than 8 events under rcp4 5 and 8 5 fig 18k l for 10 20 day wet spell lengths similar spatio temporal frequency is observed however moving inland long duration spell events diminishes 5 discussions for the rain fed agricultural system such as that found at the pra catchment knowledge of wet and dry spell variations and their frequencies over seasonal and annual timescales are essential assets the propagation of atmospheric wave activities mostly influences the wet and dry spell frequency of different duration for instance the 2 3 4 5 and 6 9 day wet spells are known to be associated with the propagation of the african easterly waves whereas the 10 20 day wet spells are linked to the coupled land atmosphere interaction in the west african monsoon rainfall e g froidurot and diedhiou 2017 these waves could enhance or suppress convection leading to storms depending on their proximity and location to the african easterly jet axis parker 2017 from figs 4 and 5 short duration spells are observed to be highest over the catchment the short duration wet spell is likely to increase during the rainy season from march to november in contrast the long duration dry spell length 16 21 is likely to occur during the dry harmattan period extending from december to february on the other hand dense evergreen forest and perennial crops may be partly responsible for the low high frequency in the dry wet spells of short duration at the central to north east of the pra catchment therefore the land surface dynamics play a key role in influencing the climate at the micro to macro scales the low lying southern most part of the catchment has a lower chance of experiencing moderate wet spell duration of 6 9 day possibly due to its low lying topography as well as the landuse dynamics the frequency of dry and wet spells aid agricultural practices within the catchment at the upper pra since the short duration dry spells incorporated in short duration wet spells provide sufficient time for moisture infiltration into the soil for plant use thus the soil is neither over nor under saturated for plants to utilise in proper growth a prominent factor that primarily dictates the rainfall pattern is the north south oscillation of the inter tropical discontinuity itd the high frequency of the short duration dry and wet spells on the seasonal timescale shows that these are the main contributors to annual rainy and dry days although mam and son are rainy months the least frequency of 2 3 day dry spells is observed in mam as the number of rainy days increases due to the northward migration of the itd furthermore the convergence zone southward retreat during son results in an increasing decreasing frequency in dry and wet spells respectively the reduction increase in dry wet spell length during mam and son can also be inferred from the seasonal wet days where the former has a higher number of wet days as compared to the latter an increasing frequency in the short wet spell duration at the catchment from mam especially april favours the onset of the growing period by providing sufficient amount of moisture to support crop growth after a period of a dry spell in djf the south towards the coast of the catchment 2 3 day wet spell duration observed a low frequency of less than 2 days in jja and son this low frequency has also been observed by bichet and diedhiou 2018 who found the reduction in spell frequency along the coast has favoured more numerous and intense isolated wet days while djf comprises of only dry months the month of november usually represents the cessation of rainfall in the south which implies that increasing dry days in november can negatively impact the wet day conditions at the south during son similarly in august the little dry spell casts cloudy conditions over the catchment with little to no rain occurrence therefore august s little dryness can play a critical role in reducing the number of wet spells especially those of short duration at the catchment during jja froidurot and diedhiou 2017 observed such dryness along the guinea coast in august as the number of wet spells reduced considerably however per figs 9 and 10e f this dryness s contribution possibly begins in july with more isolated wet days meanwhile the moderate to low frequency in wet spells during son as a minor rainy season means that rainfall may result from a higher frequency of isolated rainy wet days than consecutive wet days from the variability of wet days at the catchment there is a possible contribution of isolated rainfall events to the seasonal wet spells in the face of imminent climate change the rcps project a double or triple in the frequency of wet and dry spell lengths this increase is likely to result in extreme conditions such as drought and flooding for a catchment which has been the hotspot for anthropogenic activities such as illegal mining without land reclamation deforestation for urban expansion and indiscriminate timber logging for construction purposes these spell frequencies would be problematic in the future most importantly these climate extremes would be exacerbated by the increase in the medium to long duration wet and dry spells coupled with plausible scenarios of changes in projected landuse as undertaken by awotwi et al 2018 the agricultural sector and all other socio economic activities are expected to be affected by the increase in wet and dry spells for agricultural purposes these extremes can be constrained to rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 by undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment and implementing a strict adaptation and mitigation plan at least in the long term at the catchment divergence and convergence of air play a critical role in forming deep and shallow convection during the wet monsoon season over the catchment and west africa as a whole a low level convergence with a corresponding upper level divergence favours deep convective systems while low level convergence with mid level divergence favours shallow convection according to parker 2017 deep convective cells can quickly be suppressed if there is divergence with an anticyclonic streamlines curvature at the 925 hpa and 850 hpa with a corresponding cyclonic circulation at the 200 hpa level the amount of rainfall in both cases differs with higher quantities during deep convective cases the formation of these convective systems also depends on sufficient moisture availability favourable wind direction and a lift mechanism to advect moisture from the surface to the upper troposphere parker 2017 for instance during mam a strong convergence exists at the immediate south at the 1000 hpa because it is of a lower elevation nevertheless at 850 hpa convergence is prominent and strong especially over the northern sector of the catchment where there are orographic effects accordingly the divergence at the upper levels at 200 hpa is also found to be strong suggesting a zone of deep convection at the north of the catchment during mam the consequences of the convergence divergence dynamics in mam at the entire catchment enhance the number of rainy days and increase wet spell frequency for the short duration spells in these months as observed in fig 8 in jja the lower upper level convergence divergence is restricted to the upper pra only resulting in a higher frequency of short duration wet spell over the region the south westerly winds ensures the advection of sufficient moisture to the catchment which is lifted to upper levels due to the convergence the vertically integrated moisture divergence vimd indicates the rate of moisture influx into and out of a region in this case the moisture is integrated from the top of the atmosphere to the surface copernicus climate change service c3s 2017 in djf although moisture converges over the north western part of the pra catchment the total amount of moisture associated is low 40 mm see fig 13 moist airmass may diverge from the south due to its proximity to the sea to inland areas in mam substantial moisture divergence is located at the confluence of the two major tributaries offin and birim to the main pra river the intense insolation reaching the surface within this period leading to the onset of rain could contribute to the high moisture content over the confluence which is advected to the north west of the catchment the moisture transport is shown form the south easterly direction of winds at the 850 hpa and 200 hpa with the strong anticyclonic curvature in mam from fig 11 the moisture advection process in mam aids in establishing and maintaining the higher wet spell frequency observed during this period at the entire catchment over mountainous areas the constant low total moisture content in son may result from increased rainfall at the mountain s base wypych et al 2018 in the 2 3 day wet spell divergence composite in mam the south easterly winds at 500 hpa fig 14f increases moisture content which can be observed in the higher tcw fig 16f in jja the anticyclonic circulation at 500 hpa fig 14o induces a ridge from the south east to the north west of the catchment which coupled with the low level southerlies at 850 hpa fig 14g supports the formation of rainfall during the wet spell also the importance of moisture in regulating dry spells can be observed in the composites of vimd and tcw for instance regardless of the strong magnitude of convergence over the entire catchment from mam to son during dry spells fig 15b d the corresponding tcw ranges from normal to below normal especially during mam fig 16b d which favours the occurrence of dry spells however for wet spells the dipole of divergence and convergence over the catchment is essential in increasing moisture content to above normal levels fig 15e h for rainfall initiation in jja wet spell the stronger convergence at the south of the catchment may be favourable for the spell frequency fig 15g the increase in moisture in djf during the wet spell fig 16e usually results from the interaction of the itd with the mid latitude trough in a tongue like structure this trough draws the itd a few kilometres north from its normal position south during this period in turn the northward propagation of the itd favours unusual dry season moisture advection into the catchment and rainfall enhancement 6 conclusions knowledge in the spatio temporal distribution of wet and dry spells is crucial for the rain fed agricultural system found at the pra river catchment in recent years the catchment has been characterised by rapid urbanisation deforestation and mining activities without land reclamation which poses a threat to the climate and hydrology this study investigated the variability of wet and dry spells and associated atmospheric dynamics at the catchment from 1981 to 2019 specifically we studied the spell frequency of different duration and wet days at different timescales and under rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 furthermore the study investigated the influence of atmospheric dynamics on the seasonal rainfall and spell composites at the catchment the study used the chirps data and a 1 mm threshold of rainfall to distinguish between rainy and non rainy days wet and dry spells were separated into four categories each with the former comprising of 2 3 4 5 6 9 and 10 20 days while the latter consisted of 2 3 4 6 7 15 and 16 21 days seasonal 2 3 day wet and dry spell composites of the atmospheric dynamics in divergence vertical integrated moisture divergence and total column water from era5 were also employed the study results showed that the short duration wet 2 3 4 5 and dry spells 2 3 4 6 were the most frequent at the pra catchment on both the annual and seasonal timescales the frequency for 2 3 day wet and dry spells were highest at the south with less than 9 events and greater than 21 events respectively on the seasonal timescale short duration dry wet spells were at a maximum minimum during djf and minimum maximum in the months of mam on the subseasonal timescale in the 2 3 day wet spells the contribution of may and june were highest for mam and jja respectively under the three rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 from 2029 to 2099 an increase in both wet and dry spells is expected as compared to the baseline period the frequency in the spells is expected to be highest in rcp8 5 and least in rcp2 6 the seasonal divergence analyses also revealed a strong convergence at the lower levels 850 hpa during mam over the entire catchment with a corresponding strong divergence at the upper levels 200 hpa which supports deep convection during the onset of the rains during jja convergence was restricted to the mountainous regions at the lower levels whereas divergence exists over the same regions at the upper levels only vertical integrated moisture divergence is strongest at the lower catchment during djf with near total convergence over the entire catchment in jja total column moisture content increases 45 mm from mam to son to support rainfall activities composites of 2 3 day dry and wet spells showed that a dipole of moisture convergence and divergence over the catchment is vital for increasing tcw to above normal levels favouring the wet spells in djf to son on the other hand total moisture convergence over the catchment in mam to son are favourable for dry spells with corresponding normal to below normal amounts in tcw finally strong south easterlies at 500 hpa in mam establishment of a ridge from an anticyclonic circulation at same pressure level in jja along with low level southerlies at 850 in jja also act to support wet spell occurrences due to time and computational constraints a few limitation exist in this study climate change analyses need to use the ensemble mean of climate projection data and different climate projection models for this study a single ensemble r1i1p1 under each rcp was used from a single climate model mpi esm mr hence in future analysis it would be useful to incorporate more than one ensemble and climate model to reduce projection biases and give a comprehensive view of spells over the pra catchment besides this study showed the composite of atmospheric controls for only the 2 3 day dry and wet spells the atmospheric conditions over the catchment also needs to be understood for the moderate and long duration spells nonetheless the results obtained from this study gives a new perspective into the spell distribution and variability within the pra catchment the study contributes a piece of essential information to aid water resource management and agriculture the spell variability serves as an informed platform to factor irrigation mechanisms to boost crop farming in the catchment regionally the potential increase in wet spell frequency is likely to result in increasing flooding activities at the catchment the study therefore improves understanding of the land atmosphere interaction on the micro macro climate at the regional scale author contributions

ratio eqr for fish were assessed based on an ensemble of 17 bias corrected regional climate models forced by the emission scenario rcp8 5 a dry a medium and a wet model were identified for the future period 2071 2100 changes in water balances for catchments impacts on groundwater level and fish ecological quality ration fish eqr were evaluated the impact changes were based on an integrated transient coupled groundwater and surface water flow model set up with a horizontal resolution of 200m 200m for the two catchments new hydrological insights for the region strengths and weaknesses of eqr assessments based on symbolic regression methods compared to expert assessments based on flow calendar and max flow changes in percent exceedance thresholds q95 were identified while the modelled impact of climate change on monthly flow and flow calendar follows the same pattern at all monitoring stations the impact on groundwater level and fish eqrs are more complex and somewhat ambiguous across realisations and catchments keywords climate change impacts groundwater fish eqr hydrological modelling and denmark 1 introduction the european water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec wfd was designed to achieve good ecological status in most european rivers lakes and wetlands and at the same time to assure good quantitative and chemical status of groundwater bodies by 2015 quevauviller et al 2011 although climate change is not explicitly included in the wfd the instructed step wise and cyclic approach of the river basin management planning process makes it well suited to adaptively manage climate change impacts issues like water availability groundwater level and river flow intensity and frequency of extreme events floods and drought episodes and water quality and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems require a model based approach to quantify the impact of future climate changes on flow regime groundwater recharge groundwater level and ecological quality ratio eqr furthermore robust and adaptive river basin management measures should be identified and implemented and uncertainty should be embraced by using a range of climate models and emissions scenarios european commission 2009 in order to protect the environment and prepare for extreme water related events the eu guidance document on climate change provides 11 key guiding principles european commission 2009 these recommend that direct and indirect climate pressures should be properly evaluated climate signals should be monitored in order to react when signals emerge monitoring should focus on reference sites without other anthropogenic impacts in order to distinguish between impacts from human activities and climate change in denmark sustainable groundwater abstraction considers two aspects 1 aquifer safe yield and 2 ecological flow aquifer safe yield is calculated based on modelled groundwater abstractions and fluxes into groundwater bodies the fraction between accumulated groundwater abstraction and accumulated recharge is calculated for screening purposes henriksen and refsgaard 2013 henriksen et al 2008 the following definition of sustainable groundwater abstraction safe yield has been proposed by henriksen and refsgaard 2013 the safe yield of a groundwater aquifer is the amount of groundwater which can be pumped from an aquifer without unacceptable negative impacts on groundwater level and water quality compared to pre developmental virgin situation the wfd recommends that an aquifer water balance is established and a sustainable fraction for supporting aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems is estimated in denmark assessment of ecological flow european commission 2015 acreman 2016 impacts caused by groundwater abstraction 99 of all water consumption is based on groundwater are considered based on acceptable changes in eqr for macroinvertebrates dvfi and fish dffva these are inspired by the wider literature on ecological flow and relationships between flow regime alteration and ecological response and use of ecological indicators to develop environmental flow standards poff et al 2010 hoekstra et al 2012 liu et al 2020a b in the literature the ecological flow is defined as the environmental flow requirements are the important flow regime characteristics i e the quantity frequency timing and duration of flow events rates of change and predictability variability that are required to maintain or restore the natural flow regime in order to maintain specified valued features of the ecosystem henriksen and refsgaard 2013 the european member states divide the eqr for each surface water category into five classes by means of a threshold value for the biological quality elements which shows the demarcation between those different classes namely high good moderate poor and bad the approach taken has been to design flow biota relationships graeber et al 2014 2017 poff and zimmermann 2010 between flow regime variables and the ecological quality ratio for three biotic indices for macroinvertebrates macrophytes and fish based on a number of danish stream sites based on 72 flow regime variables symbolic regression was used to develop a number of models that could potentially predict the relationship between flow regime variables and eqr for fish macroinvertebrates and macrophytes graeber et al 2014 the range of possible values of eqr 0 1 are then classified into a semiquantitative ecological status and the variation of eqr values are then modelled as a function of environmental variables using hydrological regime metrics the variation in hydrological metrics depends upon the intensity of groundwater abstraction and climate variability change effects this variation can be estimated from dynamical groundwater surface water models and climate projection finally the effects of actual intensity of groundwater abstraction on the fish and macroinvertebrate based eqr are estimated henriksen et al 2019 an alternative approach for evaluating flow impacts on fish is based on the so called flow calendar as proposed by olsen et al 2013 here acceptable changes in flow are evaluated for different seasons the paper discuss strengths and weaknesses of the alternative approaches for small headwater streams and larger streams and the need for developing either more accurate empirical formulas including also temperature water quality and a wider set of stressors or to further develop the flow calendar approach another overall aim of using modelling to monitor the freshwater cycle is to strengthen the assessment of different water balance elements through a combined use of monitoring and modelling data henriksen et al 2008 this is particularly the case for fish eqr dffva evaluation as neither groundwater recharge nor impacts from climate change and groundwater abstraction can be measured directly liu et al 2020a b has shown examples for such quantifications of the effects of groundwater abstraction liu et al 2020a and climate change impacts liu et al 2020b for the uggerby river catchment in northern jutland denmark based on swat modflow with flow biota empirical models the fish index and macrophyte index were shown to be the most responsive to climate change changes however with a complex pattern liu et al 2020b and large regional differences in flow regime alteration due to future increase or decrease in flow flow regime alteration induced by climate change may benefit rainbow trout due to positive response to increase in winter high flows wenger et al 2011 but a future decrease of streamflow or higher frequency of low flow events in future climate could lead to the opposite effects during situations of prolonged drought elimination some biota leading to lower species diversity bunn and arthington 2002 flow regime shifts induced by effects of climate change can therefore improve ecological state in some streams and reduce state in others cui et al 2018 the purpose of the paper is to quantify climate induced changes in water balances hydrological regime groundwater level and fish eqr for two case studies and to discuss strengths and weaknesses of the empirical based danish approach for three selected climate models dry median and wet under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 business as usual the novelty of the work is that we have used an integrated transient coupled groundwater and surface water flow model mike she mike hydro with three bias corrected climate models to assess the impacts of climate change on hydrological regimes and fish eqr in two large scale catchments for a comprehensive analysis of impacts on fish eqr the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the approach for hydrological modelling selection of climate models used for projections and hydrological model simulations and indicators in section 3 results of the performance test of the model are presented climate change impacts on water balance extreme runoff groundwater level and fish eqr are presented section 4 discuss the results and conclusions are found in section 5 2 methods 2 1 case studies and hydrological models ringkøbing fiord catchment is located in the western part of denmark fig 1 between the jutland ridge and the west coast van roosmalen et al 2009 the topography varies from 125 m above sea level masl in eastern part to zero at the western coast climate is of maritime regime dominated by westerly winds and extratropical cyclones with mild winters and relatively cold summers with frequent rainfall from 1989 2017 the annual mean precipitation was 888 mm per year in the ringkøbing fjord catchment with the driest year reaching 597 mm yr and the wettest year 1054 mm year similarly the mid zealand catchment has an annual mean precipitation of 719 mm year with the extreme dry year reaching 509 mm yr and the wettest year reaching 943 mm yr for both catchments autumn and winter are the wet seasons whereas spring is the dry season the annual mean temperature between 1989 and 2017 in the ringkøbing fjord catchment is 8 5 c the annual mean temperature in the mid zealand catchment is 8 8 c for both sites temperature is low for winter and autumn reaching monthly mean temperatures of 1 3 c in contrast the warmest temperatures are observed during july and september the area has in general highly permeable soils and discharge to the streams is dominated by groundwater base flow the mid zealand catchment fig 2 is characterized by glaciomorphological topography henriksen et al 2003 with a near surface geology consisting of quaternary deposits overlying tertiary limestone and marls chalk aquifers shallow runoff drainage flow dominates the discharge pattern while groundwater recharge to the chalk aquifers is more limited the impacts from the purely groundwater based irrigation require a fully coupled numerical groundwater and surface water flow model the hydrological modelling software used in this study is mike she mike hydro version 2019 an integrated physically based and distributed hydrological model abbott et al 1986 in this study the hydrological modelling setup is based on a refined version of the national water resource model stisen et al 2018 that describes all the major processes of the hydrological cycle precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff groundwater recharge abstraction and irrigation drainage flow and groundwater discharge to surface water lakes and the sea henriksen et al 2008 højberg et al 2012 2015 sonnenborg et al 2003 stisen et al 2012a b the underlying geological model is discretized into a 100 m 100 m grid stisen et al 2019 and the hydrological model has a horizontal grid size of 200 m 200 m which is a significant refinement compared to the national water resource model where a grid size of 500 m 500 m is applied river routing is simulated by mike hydro using a kinematic routing method stisen et al 2018 compared the results of this relatively simple solution with a hydrodynamic solution and concluded that it is a reliable approach for simulating runoff and water level for most discharge stations the performance was acceptable compared to screening criteria for nash sutcliffe efficiency and water balance furthermore larger models using the kinematic routing solution are running 20 50 times faster which is important for detailed models of large catchments as investigated here daily output time steps of both simulated discharge and hydraulic head elevation were specified in order to obtain reliable and accurate results results on discharge are calculated at every q point in the model setup that are located at a mutual distance of approximately 100 m modelling of drainage flow from agricultural areas is important in relation to hydrological regime variables groundwater drainage including both natural and artificial drainage is simulated dynamically as a function of groundwater level in mike she in this setup the drainage flux is generated once the groundwater level is above the defined drainage level and it is removed from the saturated zone by a rate controlled by the drainage time constant and routed to surface water bodies or beyond the model boundaries by following a topographical grid code map butts and graham 2005 drain level and time constant are distributed based on drain class undrained built up near natural forest intensive agriculture and extensive agriculture in addition to this the model drain level has been scaled based on land surface elevation variability within each model grid the higher the standard deviation of the 10 m dem elevation values within the respective model grid the higher drain depth has been assumed in the 200 m model stisen et al 2018 stisen et al 2019 in the projection to future climate a sea level rise of 1 m has been incorporated in the modelling of groundwater level and flow a total of 250 small streams were added to the river network for the ringkøbing fiord catchment and 10 streams to the mid zealand catchment furthermore gradient boundary flux conditions were applied to the model boundaries based on observed piezometric head measurements and fluxes simulated across boundaries in fig 1 model areas and river networks are shown monitoring stations including performance test results for nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and mean error me for 1989 2018 are indicated by the symbol colours finally the quantitative performance of the refined model setups was compared with results of the national model in order to validate the used setups and the qualitative performance was visually checked for selected time series against monitoring data for 1989 2018 2 2 climate modelling a subset of 16 regional climate models rcm from the euro cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 are analysed in this study all models are forced by the rcp 8 5 pathway moss et al 2010 as this is the scenario that reproduces the current emission trajectory more accurately hayhoe et al 20172017 all models are forced by the rcp 8 5 emission scenario moss et al 2010 the spatial resolution of the models is 0 11 degree 12 5 km at a daily time step when compared to the observations the raw simulation results from the rcms generally show systematic biases ehret et al 2012 therefore the climate model outputs used in this study are statistically bias corrected using a distribution based approach and downscaled to match the observation grid from the danish meteorological institute dmi cells at 10 10 km for precipitation and 20 20 km for temperature the method is described in detail by pasten zapata et al 2019 and briefly involves matching the simulated distributions of precipitation and temperature to the distribution of the observations through statistical relationships such relationships are then used to correct the simulations of the climate projections from 1971 to 2100 it should be noted that there are different assumptions and limitations linked to the bias correction approaches such as the assumption of temporal stationarity of the statistical relationships the dependence on the bias correction period here 1990 2009 and the possible alteration of the climate change signal the reader is referred to the book by maraun and widmann 2018 for a detailed explanation of such limitations and assumptions the projected change in the seasonal mean precipitation and potential evapotranspiration by the end of the century 2071 2100 compared to the reference period 1981 2010 are estimated for each bias corrected rcm based on this information three models are selected representing dry median and wet projections gcm rcm dry ichec ec earth hirham median ichec ec earth racmo wet ipsl cmsa mr rca the three models project changes in precipitation during winter season where groundwater recharge in denmark is significant between 50 mm yr and 210 mm yr fig 3 summer precipitation is projected to increase by 25 mm 55 mm the three selected climate models cover the span in precipitation important for groundwater recharge and low flow in rivers the reason for selecting three models is to select the main variance among the 16 climate models in order to provide an accurate analysis of hydrological impacts pasten zapata et al 2019 2 3 methodology for analysing climate change s impacts on the hydrological regime the hydrological models were run with climate inputs from the three selected climate models in two 30 year periods from 1981 to 2010 and from 2071 2100 values of daily discharge and groundwater levels for 5 day intervals were generated for both the reference 1981 2010 and the future 2071 2100 periods and water balances were compiled for the land area monthly discharge and groundwater level data were calculated and extracted at selected monitoring wells and discharge stations flow duration curves annual maximum minimum and mean runoff were compiled and statistics were calculated changes in groundwater levels were evaluated finally ecological flow indicators for fish eqr dffva macroinvertebrates eqr dvfi and macrophytes eqr dvpi were calculated at all approximately 25 000 river calculation points in the following focus will be on fish eqr partly because dvpi is not used as part of rbmp2 and rbmp3 in denmark and partly because dvfi is not very sensitive to flow changes liu et al 2020b henriksen et al 2014 2 4 method for analysing fish eqr the empirical formulas for fish eqr are developed based on symbolic regression analysis for fish macrophytes and macro invertebrates carried out on observed data from different stream sites graeber et al 2014 yang et al 2008 of the indicators that are developed and implemented by use of a national water resources model henriksen et al 2014 fish eqr is the most restrictive and sensitive to flow changes since the metrics for fish eqr are normalised with median flow q50 to the interval from 0 to 1 acceptable changes in fish eqr values can be established and used for screening purposes henriksen et al 2014 the fish eqr is classified by the following thresholds high 0 94 good 0 72 0 94 moderate 0 40 0 71 poor 0 11 0 39 and bad 0 11 when calculating annual frequencies of events with flow above the 25th percentile from the flow duration curve fre25 and annual frequency of events with flows below the 75th percentile from the flow duration curve fre75 relative exceedance thresholds are defined from q25 and q75 for a selected period in this case based on the period 2004 2012 where both hydrological and biological data were available liu et al 2020b the indicator for fish fish eqr is presented in eq 1 validation tests have been carried out at 61 locations with a nash sutcliffe coefficient of 0 49 graeber et al 2014 the correlation of determination r2 was estimated as 0 53 p 0 001 see liu et al 2020b 1 fish eqr 0 058 s i n 0 319 0 811 b f i 0 050 f r e 25 0 0413 f r e 75 n 61 n s e 0 49 in eq 1 bfi is the dimensionless baseflow index baseﬂow volume divided by total ﬂow volume fre25 is the number of high flow events defined by average number of events on the hydrograph per year above the 25th percent exceedance flow value q25 fre75 is the number of low flow events per year and is defined as the average number of events below the 75th percentile q75 of the flow duration curve sin is the class of sinuosity with a value of 1 4 ranging from straight channels to meandering rivers n is the number of sites and nse is the nash sutcliffe coefficient a simpler formula eq 2 was derived by dce based on median minimum q medmin q flow dce 2019 2 f i s h e q r 0 314 0 468 m e d m i n q q 50 in eq 2 medmin q is the annual daily minimum flow statistically occurring every second year corresponding to the median value of the 30 annual minimum flow values the regression provided the following result n 62 nse 0 26 medmin q is assumed to represent the groundwater component of the stream flow and has previously been applied in denmark as part of the assessment of sustainable groundwater abstraction and as part of wfd rbmp1 gap analysis henriksen et al 2008 however the relationship in eq 2 was basically derived in the same way as eq 1 and based on the fish eqr approach where median minimum q as well as all other flow terms are normalised with q50 eq 1 was established as part of rbmp2 graeber et al 2014 as part of rbmp3 eq 2 was estimated as part of a further investigation of the approach based on a different dataset dce 2019 however for the gap analyses of rbmp3 eq 1 was chosen because of the higher degree of explanation of this formula nse 0 49 henriksen 2019 fish eqr is regarded as the most reliable empirical formula of those applied in denmark and eq 1 is currently used for screening purposes in relation to gap analysis of rbmp3 wfd in denmark when using eqs 1 or 2 the exceedance thresholds like q25 q50 and q75 are calculated for each scenario period e g the reference period and future periods before the number of events are calculated for every year for the period this differs from the way relative changes in flow was calculated previously henriksen et al 2008 where reference period minimum flow was used for calculating the relative change in all scenario periods with a threshold of e g 10 15 or 25 max reduction of flow depending on stream quality goals in reality since water abstraction in denmark is based on groundwater jørgensen et al 2016 the relative exceedance thresholds are controlled by complex hydrogeological relationships climate and abstraction type where irrigation has a strong seasonal variation whereas abstractions for waterworks and industry are more constant over the year therefore in order to assess the impact of groundwater abstraction on fish eqr a dynamic groundwater surface water model provides a valuable tool for identifying and evaluating climate change effects of percentiles q50 q95 etc and fish eqr based on eq 1 and 2 three different methods for quantifying changes in flow calendar fish eqr are compared method a is given by the relative change in q95 henriksen and refsgaard 2013 henriksen et al 2008 method a α a q 95 f u t q 95 r e f q 95 r e f the screening criteria for method a is given by a maximum of 10 reduction in low flow q95 corresponding to an unacceptable change of αa 10 as proposed by henriksen and refsgaard 2013 as a precautionary first step screening in a two step approach method b is defined by the absolute change in eqr based on the simplified eq 2 using medmin q q50 method b α b f i s h e q r f u t f i s h e q r r e f 0 468 m e d m i n q q 50 f u t m e d m i n q q 50 r e f method b is included here in order to investigate how this more simplified empirical formula with a lower nse compares to the more complex formula with the higher nse and to explore whether the simplified formula eventually could be more or less sensitive to climate induced changes in groundwater flow than method c see below method c is defined as the absolute change in eqr based on eq 1 method c α c f i s h e q r f u t f i s h e q r r e f 0 811 δ b f i 0 050 δ f r e 25 0 0413 δ f r e 75 where δ indicate the change between reference and future values the screening criteria for methods b and c are in this study defined as the maximum absolute reduction of fish eqr eq 1 and eq 2 equivalent to a maximum reduction in αb or αc of less than 0 05 this threshold has been chosen in order to apply a precautionary first step screening criteria if more than 20 of the stations exceed this criteria the screening is considered to be positive it should be noted that when method c is used as part of rbmp3 for screening in relation to impacts from groundwater abstraction a threshold of αc less than 0 23 is used as part of gap analysis henriksen et al 2019 which compares to more than 80 of the stations exceeding the criteria for each case study and method changes in statistics are calculated including i change in median value based on all q points with max 50 of q points exceeding the criteria ii as for i but a maximum of 20 of q points can exceed the criteria is evaluated assuming normal distribution and estimates of mean and standard deviation by use of error function 20 low limit value median 0 841 std dev and iii assuming that maximum 20 of the discharge monitoring stations exceed the screening criteria the so called flow calendar is based on monthly seasonal flow data at the monitoring q stations the eqr and flows representing given exceedance thresholds e g q25 or q75 where flow is exceeded 25 or 75 of time respectively are compared to the alternative flow calendar method the median change of flow for each month has been calculated based on selected stations from each case study here acceptable changes in flow are evaluated for different seasons and different trout life stages flow calendar results for fry juvenile adult and spawning are based on olsen et al 2013 l see table 1 denotes that low flow is considered critical h that high flow is considered critical while n denotes that flow is normally not critically blank cells denote periods where the trout life stage is normally not present in streams 3 results 3 1 performance of used 200m 200m models the results of the performance test are shown in table 2 the performance of the 200 m models for ringkøbing fiord and mid zealand are in general improved with respect to groundwater levels compared to the calibrated national water resource model dk model2019 the simulation of runoff for ringkøbing fjord nse is slightly worse than the 500 m model based on the performance results it was evaluated that the model performance is acceptable for evaluating climate change impacts stisen et al 2019 the performance of the mid zealand model is better for groundwater where rmse and mae are reduced significantly from 3 68 m to 2 87 m and from 3 64 m to 2 83 m respectively however this is obtained at the expense of a decrease in mean error the performance on stream discharge is improved with a nse value of 0 64 compared to the original value of 0 59 overall the mid zealand model is also found acceptable for the purpose of this study in the supplementary material see s1 examples of the flow duration curves are available for a selected subset of discharge stations in the two case areas here plots are available for these stations for observed climate input and for the performance run for the period 1989 2018 the flow duration curves show an acceptable fit for most of the discharge stations therefore q25 and q75 including changes in these values are reliable we have intermediate confidence in the model results for extreme high flow q1 and low flow q95 3 2 climate change impacts on hydrological regime the water balance for the three climate model runs was calculated for present and future 30 year periods in order to visualise the changes the water balance of the other models can be found in supplementary material see s2 a significant increase in precipitation from 1014 mm yr to 1132 mm yr is found this is to some degree counterbalanced by an increase in evapotranspiration of 74 mm yr from 527 mm yr to 601 mm yr and an increase in groundwater recharge infilt incl evap where a net increase of 33 mm yr from 469 mm yr to 502 mm yr is observed however climate change also affects the hydrogeological flow components where drain flow to streams sz drain to river is increased from 158 mm yr to 217 mm yr as a result of increasing and larger seasonal fluctuations in groundwater table also the upward transport of water from the root zone increases significantly implying that the vegetation is able to extract more groundwater smaller distance to the groundwater table higher demand the overall results of climate change impacts on water balances calculated as a climate factor for the three climate model scenarios are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the median climate model representing rcp8 5 for 2071 2100 for the ringkøbing catchment shows an increased groundwater recharge with a climate factor of 1 20 abstraction has a climate factor of 1 61 explained by the increased irrigation demand which is almost doubled for the median climate model by the end of this century climate factor 1 93 drainage flow is increased by a factor 1 37 and overland flow is increased by more than a factor of three whereas baseflow is only slightly increased in this scenario by a factor 1 07 the wet and dry models show the wide range between different climate models causing a span in recharge between 1 49 and 1 07 but with a doubling of irrigation amount and significant changes in drainage and overland flow runoff the results for the mid zealand catchment are in the same range with respect to groundwater recharge abstraction is unchanged since irrigation in mid zealand is not of explicit importance in the total water balance fig 4 shows different discharge results from two monitoring stations one from each catchment only results from the median climate model are presented the two other models can be found in supplementary material see s3 the results representing observed climate 1989 2018 cover almost the same period as those representing simulated climate in the reference period 1981 2010 and thus provides an opportunity for evaluating the bias correction and complement the cross validation analysis done by pastén zapata et al 2019 the results representing observed climate 1989 2018 cover almost the same period as those representing simulated climate 1981 2010 and thus provides an opportunity for evaluating the bias correction the bias correction is overall valid for monthly mean yearly max and min and for the flow duration curves however comparing the model results to observation data of minimum and maximum yearly flow on daily basis show some deviation especially for yearly minimum of station q580047 the results are still within the expected uncertainty keeping in mind that the model has only been calibrated on the national scale the purpose is not detailed modelling for climate change adaptation but rather a more strategic goal the reliability or confidence is high for monthly results in runoff and to some degree maximum runoff whereas confidence in simulated daily minimum values and climate factors are less reliable the flow duration curves shown in fig 4 show a rather good fit for most of the discharge stations therefore q25 and q75 including changes in these values are reliable we have intermediate confidence in the model results for extreme high flow q1 and low flow q95 monthly mean flows in winter are projected to increase significantly in the future and the monthly flow is almost doubled in february for ringkøbing fjord low flow is expected to increase for ringkøbing fjord catchment however for the mid zealand catchment a decrease in yearly monthly low flow which in the future tend to occur in september instead of august in the present climate for the dry climate model results for the mid zealand catchment show quite significant changes for summer months for some stations see supplementary material s4 with up to 40 reduction in monthly low flow the dry model for the ringkøbing fjord catchment shows a rather complex response with a decrease of 10 for most stations the discharge for the median climate model for the mid zealand catchment increase flows with 30 50 in winter months from december to march at most stations and also increase flow in most summer months see fig 4 for the ringkøbing fiord catchment the median climate model increase flows in all months with the highest increases in winter months 10 20 the wet model shows somewhat similar pattern however the increasing flow in winter months are more severe 30 50 see supplementary material s4 the dry model shows relatively smaller gains in winter months and reduced flows in summer months in fig 5 the depth to shallow groundwater table phreatic depth and change in groundwater level for the median climate model for ringkøbing are shown the overall median and standard deviation of the change in shallow groundwater level for catchment from the reference period to the future period for all climate models is shown in table 4 the depth to shallow groundwater follows in general the same ranking as the wet median and dry model and the ranking of groundwater recharge for ringkøbing there are generally many areas with a depth to the groundwater of more than three meters and up to about 10 m the median model produces more moderate changes typically 25 50 cm at individual sites up to 2 m and in many areas unchanged groundwater levels wet model result in larger increases in level the dry model mainly point to an unchanged or descending groundwater table in some places locally up to one meter or locally more in the dry model in some areas a decrease of approximately 1 2 m is simulated the same overall picture if found for mid zealand but since evapotranspiration is much higher on the clayey moraine till increases in groundwater level are less than for ringkøbing and areas with decreasing shallow groundwater levels are in some areas larger it can be seen from fig 5 that the changes in groundwater level in general are most significant in areas with the largest depth to the phreatic surface whereas floodplain areas show more limited changes it should be noted that the results shown in fig 5 in table 5 the overall results from the three climate model projections in the two catchments are listed for simulated changes in monthly flow for the flow calendar periods as listed in table 1 climate change has positive impacts on fish spawning for most realisations but not for the dry climate model in july september low flow is considered critical to some degree all year round for spawning and since the wet and median models show increased flow better spawning conditions are expected in general for ringkøbing and mid zealand catchments for trout or salmon fry high flows are considered critical for april june and low flows for july september here model results reveal that the wet and median models generally show increased flow which therefore could be considered less favourable for fry however the same models show improved or unchanged conditions for july september due to increased flow so the impact on fry based on flow results only may not be critical compared to other stressors finally for juvenile trout 7 20 cm and adult trout 20 cm low flow is considered critical in summer half april june and july september in general the wet and median models show improved conditions for trout whereas the dry model shows negative changes due to less flow for future period compared to present 3 3 climate change impacts on fish eqr figs 6 and 7 show simulated changes in fish eqr calculated with eq 1 for wet median and dry climate model and with calculated mean and standard deviation for all q points within each catchment the results for ringkøbing fiord catchment fig 6 show that the wet and the dry climate models provide mixed dominated by white reaches or negative impacts dominated by yellow reaches belonging to the 20 50 probability for reduced ecological state median values of 0 007 to 0 030 and standard deviations from 0 090 to 0 052 are found the median climate model generally shows increased eqr values dominated by green reaches with a 20 50 probability of an improved ecological state with a mean value of 0 044 and a standard deviation of 0 053 this means that the median climate model does not result in a central estimate of the three selected models and that the patterns are complex when it comes to impacts on fish eqr the results for eqr dffva for the mid zealand catchment fig 7 show a different pattern of complexity where an overall large reduction in eqr is found for the wet model with a mean of 0 06 and a standard deviation of 0 089 the median model has a similar but less strong pattern mean value of 0 027 and standard deviation of 0 071 the dry model shows the largest increase in eqr in general mean of 0 018 and standard deviation of 0 052 in this case the median climate model is in between wet and dry model in table 6 statistics are show for 14 selected monitoring stations in ringkøbing fiord catchment and 21 q stations in mid zealand catchment with calculated changes in q1 q25 q75 and q95 results are given in for future period compared with reference period 1981 2010 the change in absolute eqr value for future minus reference periods is also listed according to table 6 the impact of climate change on flow conditions is significant in both catchments all percentiles are affected however the most severe impact is found for high flows q1 q25 the impact on the eqr is for most realisations moderate in no cases the eqr indicator changes by more than one probability class in the ringkøbing catchment in the mid zealand catchment changes by more than one probability class or 0 05 are only found at two monitoring stations table 7 shows results for methods a b and c are shown together with screening results for median change and an estimate of 20 of points exceeding screening criteria estimated as median change 0 841 std dev assuming normally distributed values iii is number of monitoring stations based on table 6 assessed table 7 shows that all realisations have more than 20 of qpoints with reductions in q95 method a ii above screening criteria and the dry model also exceeds the criteria for 50 of qpoints method a i method a underline an issue with low flows that are projected to reduce in future climate in a significant part of the catchment for the dry model in both catchments moving to the eqr based approaches method b with the simplified formula using medmin q q50 and method c with bfi fre25 and fre75 show more ambiguous results only the wet model for mid zealand exceeds the criteria for 50 of qpoints i but for two out of three realisations the criteria is exceeded if only 20 of qpoints are allowed to exceed the criteria contrary to method a methods b and c do not categorise the dry model for mid zealand fig 6b as critical when the evaluation is only based on discharge monitoring stations iii the results are more or less similar to i and ii 4 discussion 4 1 screening the impacts of climate change on hydrological regime flow alteration for the ringkøbing fiord catchment the three selected realisations wet median and dry model are representative samples of the overall ensemble the 16 climate model realisations for rcp8 5 when ranked by overall recharge or runoff magnitude there is uncertainty in the projected changes associated with the choice of concentration pathways therefore using all available pathways could give an insight of the total uncertainty coming from the potential scenarios nevertheless rcp 8 5 reproduces the current emission trajectory better than the other pathways due to the skill of rcp 8 5 it is comprehensive to use this pathway as driver of the projections in contrast to using the other pathways which are not able to accurately reproduce the current emission trajectory the dry climate model has the lowest or second lowest rainfall for october march among the 16 ensemble models the wet climate model has the second highest rainfall in october march finally the median climate model is fourth lowest in terms of october march rainfall for mid zealand the picture for the winter period is about the same although the wet climate model here is only the third highest among the climate models for april september all three climate models are placed centrally in the ensemble and therefore do not represent the total spread in either precipitation or evaporation for april september this eventually can explain why mid zealand in general has a more pessimistic outlook compared to ringkøbing fiord catchment which overall has a more positive outlook in terms of increased flows compared to the flow calendar the overall changes are ideal for nurturing fish habitats based on the historical climate input data for the period 1989 2018 the precipitation is significantly higher for ringkøbing fjord catchment 989 mm year compared to mid zealand 740 mm year evapotranspiration amounts to 546 mm year for central zealand while a slightly lower value of 520 mm year is found for ringkøbing fjord catchment due to sandy soils and lower root zone capacity for ringkøbing compared to mid zealand moraine till groundwater recharge is therefore significantly higher for ringkøbing fjord catchment amounts to 493 mm year compared to mid zealand amounts to 208 mm year climate projections result in significant increases in all flows in the catchment water balance terms from 1981 to 2010 to 2071 2100 by 7 27 for precipitation 13 17 for evapotranspiration and 7 49 for groundwater recharge for the dry median and wet realisation irrigation demand for ringkøbing increases by 87 123 drainage increases by 3 90 base flow increases by 0 21 and shallow run off increases by 26 281 for the three realisations it is noteworthy that changes in groundwater recharge are larger than changes in annual rainfall the results confirm earlier findings by van roosmalen et al 2009 didovets et al 2019 chase et al 2016 eum et al 2017 and müller wohlfeil et al 2000 from northern europa and north america evaluating an expected increase in groundwater recharge and runoff in winter and spring and increased evapotranspiration in summer all these changes are favourable with a flow calendar assessment for ringkøbing fiord catchment but less favourable for mid zealand due to the in general more dry summer conditions and an increase in evapotranspiration exceeding the increase in precipitation on the clayey soil these results confirm that water balance is key to projected climate generated flooding and drought risks showing complex pictures depending on selected gcm rcm and rcp didovets et al 2019 eum et al 2017 see s2 and s3 for more details on changes in water balance and streamflow changes in shallow groundwater levels are largest for areas with the largest depth to groundwater which is also in agreement with previous studies van roosmalen et al 2009 however the pattern is more detailed in the present model version due to the 200m 200m grid size and a more detailed river network in addition the present study included predicted sea level rise for the future situation 2071 2100 which impact groundwater level changes in the vicinity of ringkøbing fiord and the north sea coast irrigation demand in ringkøbing is simulated to almost double for all three models for future climate in a range comparable to what was estimated previously by van roosmalen et al 2009 for the sres emission scenario a2 ipcc 2000 using a hydrological model with a more coarse grid in the projections of future increase in irrigation due to changes in precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration we have calculated with our hydrological model an increase in irrigation for wet median and dry climate model for rcp8 5 and far future between 87 and 123 for the ringkøbing catchment which is one of the intensively irrigated catchments of denmark see table 3 for historical climate the irrigation amount to 21 mm year in average for the catchment area this change in future groundwater based irrigation demand impacts infiltration soil moisture evapotranspiration groundwater recharge streamflow and ultimately fisheqr van roosmalen et al 2009 evaluated for the same catchment an irrigation of 18 mm year and an increase of 87 for a2 scenario a2 is comparable to rcp8 5 which is in a similar range as our estimate liu et al 2020b estimated an increase for rcp8 5 in average irrigation amount of 31 48 mm year for uggerby å however as an average for irrigated land and not catchment and thus a significant average increase similar to our model simulations for ringkøbing fjord catchment for ringkøbing a significant increase in monthly flow for february is simulated above 50 increase for mid zealand forced by the wet climate model a doubling of flow is simulated while a smaller but still significant increase in flow is found for the median climate model the impacts of the dry model was moderate in general the results show that daily high flow percentiles q1 are increased significantly whereas daily low flow percentiles q95 show a more complex change pattern for some stream reaches and forcings with both increasing and decreasing low flow van roosmalen et al 2009 simulated an increase in monthly flow for february around 35 and a decrease for september for skjern å downstream part st 22 14 of 15 for a2 scenario liu et al 2020b for uggerby river catchment downstream part subbasin 18 for rcp8 5 simulated the largest relative increase to happen in january 16 increase for february an 13 increase and the largest decrease for july was simulated to 20 compared to these figures and including the results for q01 and q95 our model agree more or less about the increase in monthly high flow for february with the study of van roosmaalen et al 2009 but the impact on low flow seems to be more moderate with changes in minimum flow rather stable in the future climate compared to present climate but with significant increases in high flow these differences may be due to several factors hydrological model and process description model structure differences bias correction where we used a dual distribution based scaling methodology pasten zapata et al 2019 on a 10 10 km scale for precipitation and 20 20 km scale for evapotranspiration there is a difference in model resolution van roosmaalen et al 2009 applied a 1 1 km hydrological model we used a 200 200 m model and other factors can be representation of groundwater abstraction soil land use geology etc the applied mike she model was discretized into more than 15 calculation layers for saturated zone and the river network was fairly detailed however for the dry model q95 is reduced for both case studies the median and dry models reveal that in many reaches q95 have decreased by more than 10 which is an older screening criteria henriksen and refsgaard 2013 henriksen et al 2008 in relation to minimum flow and impacts on spawning and nursery reaches could therefore be critical if some reaches dry up during dry spell events of longer duration at several discharge stations and reaches reductions by more than 20 and at a few above 40 are found contrary to this the wet climate model results in increased low flow q95 for mid zealand the patterns are even more complex but due to increased evapotranspiration for the eastern denmark case study all three climate models result in a significant number of critical reaches when using the previously suggested 10 low flow maximum reduction screening criteria henriksen and refsgaard 2013 it should be noted that the simulated changes in low flow are in addition to the impacts from all current abstractions in the two areas henriksen et al 2019 which reveal that climate change is more critical for fish eqr than groundwater abstractions this implies that climate change cause a more extreme hydrological regime for rcp8 5 2071 2100 eum et al 2017 as highlighted by liu et al 2020b climate change can affect stream ecosystems through flow regime alterations that are particularly complex in catchments with significant groundwater contribution as ringkøbing fiord catchment but we also see complex alterations for the mid zealand catchment due to the chalk aquifer and complex drainage flow discharges and adverse impacts from increased evapotranspiration due to clayey soil and larger root zone soil moisture storage capacity conditions stein et al 2017 suggested that for reaches with good biology i e in our case good ecological status for fish in large and small streams it is important to monitor for factors that may reduce resilience falkenmark et al 2019 unfortunately the discharge monitoring stations may not be located in the reaches where we see the largest impacts on ecological quality ration eqr for fish many smaller and some larger reaches are today in poor biological quality for fish moderate poor or bad status and for such reaches flow management could be a measure including evaluation of hydrologic alteration among other stressors furthermore the groundwater monitoring network are not placed at the locations with the largest simulated increases in shallow groundwater level there is a need to extend the quantitative monitoring network with additional monitoring stations in streams and groundwater that are sensitive to climate changes 4 2 strengths and weaknesses of the eqr fish empirical approach for april september the dry climate model projects a relatively high rainfall amount compared to other climate models at the high end of the ensemble with respect to precipitation which could explain why fish eqr based approaches do not evaluate the dry realisation as a critical state in this respect method c that incorporates fish eqr building blocks like base flow index predictability of flow high flow pulses fre25 and low flow events below q75 fre75 do a better job compared to more traditional flow change methods method a however fish eqr do not capture radical and extreme low flow for such events where groundwater and daily minimum low flow is reduced the most resulting in the largest footprint in terms of drying up of the headwater reaches method a may be needed as an additional methodology for small streams 10 km2 on the larger flood plains of ringkøbing fiord catchment characterized by sandy soils with widespread and intensive groundwater based irrigation the changes in groundwater level are small or none fig 5 bottom this is explained by 1 increased evapotranspiration from river valleys and 2 increased irrigation demand at the agricultural fields which in dry periods lead to increased groundwater abstraction resulting in decreased annual minimum low flows in these areas we can see a general reduction in eqr for many larger reaches especially for the dry model when using relative reduction of q95 method a and medmin q q50 method b for the wet and median models but not for the dry model but eventually as mentioned above this could be due to the lack of extreme summer precipitation in the selected dry realisation however this highlights the ambiguity which can be diagnosed in situations where flow regime has complex impacts in this case q50 is more reduced relative to medmin q this illustrates the challenges with normalised empirical equations derived from a set of spatially distributed discharge stations and used for a temporal analysis of changes in fish eqr the strong side of fish eqr is that such formulas can be used for increases in flow which is not possible for method a as illustrated by the flow calendar this approach attempt to look out for both increased and decreased flow therefore it can be a supplementary approach in line with method a but with a more general applicability but if the low degree of explanation is also taken into consideration nse 0 26 for empirical formula for method b method b do not provide any real improvement of method c used for danish rbmp2 and 3 even though it illustrates how fish eqr indicators are more focused on extremity than amount of flow and extreme instead of mean conditions when using method c the rcp8 5 scenario turns out to have an improved fish eqr value it is not fully clear why method c produces this result we can only speculate that the number of pulses for fre25 may be increased and or that fre75 may be decreased or bfi increased for future compared to present climate when comparing results based on larger catchments only ii and iii show similar results in the study by liu et al 2020b for uggerby river catchment in northern zealand the fish indices fish eqr were most responsive in the large and some small streams decreasing up to 14 whereas in the median and some small streams the fish eqr benefitted from climate change by showing an increase of up to 14 these findings are in line with our findings from ringkøbing catchment and confirm the importance of a comprehensive hydrological modelling of the complex patterns for especially groundwater dominated catchments as explained by liu et al 2020b bfi generally increased in the rcp8 5 scenario for uggerby catchment while the value of weak peak flow events fre25 decreased low flow events frequency fre75 increased in large streams but decreased in medium streams or were unchanged in small streams the projected changes in especially the difference between fre25 and fre75 explains why the fish eqr changes for ringkøbing catchment decrease for some large streams like omme river and skjern river but it also highlights a need for investigating whether peak flow variable like q01 max runoff which are significantly impacted by climate change as shown in rcp8 5 for ringkøbing and with extreme changes for the mid zealand catchment where max flow increase by several magnitudes for mid zealand the fish eqr based screening methods methods b and c agree with the relative reduction of the low flow approach method a with respect to the wet and median models but disagree when it comes to the dry model when combining method a and method c as suggested above for ringkøbing all three realisations show that rcp8 5 is problematic for fish eqr for the eastern part of denmark since screening yield a result above the threshold both for small and large streams especially for smaller streams there are sources of uncertainty which should be mentioned liu et al 2020a since only a few observed eqr values for fish has been collected for such waters method a however is not a perfect method as also documented by graeber et al 2014 as also shown in this manuscript uncertainty in annual daily low flow is very significant and that also impact median minimum low flow a better approach could therefore be to further develop the flow calendar method and include this in the assessment when doing so the flow calendar may conclude that too much flow may be a more general problem than too little flow 4 3 the need for methodological development and a wider set of stressors the fish eqr indicators method c including baseflow index fre25 fre75 and meandering of riverline as a proxy variable for physical conditions in streams has a good degree of explanation but is not fully applicable for small streams 10km2 a way forward could be to include more stressors of relevance like water quality land use changes bank erosion temperature oxygen content etc villeneuve et al 2018 de vries et al 2019 pletterbauer et al 2018 in rbmp2 and 3 for denmark the most sensitive indicator has been eq 1 however as shown here for especially small streams an analysis based on 30 year statistics and empirical equations that do not consider flooding and drought events in a more comprehensive way is probably not adequate for analysis of climate forcing and impacts on biology it may be a problem that the model is too uncertain for implementing low flows like q95 and q95 q50 since it has not been specifically calibrated towards such metrics instead we may have to use a more robust measure that the model can simulate since the established empirical equations are based on observed discharge and observed fish eqr without any differential split sample validation and furthermore are extrapolated to flow regimes far away from the ones used for establishing the empirical formulas there is a clear knowledge gap furthermore based on the present analysis for two case studies it can be concluded that we need to rethink ecological quality ratio approaches since they are only based on steady state assumptions about flow for a 6 7 year period and has not been calibrated and cross validated against changing flow conditions an alternative and practical way forward could be to utilize the opportunities that more water in wet periods is predicted excess water may be stored and used in the more frequent dry periods with this perspective the way forward is to further develop the equations add more about physical conditions than meandering and incorporate for example water quality bank erosion oxygen temperature vegetation groundwater depths and exchange flow new equations should be derived using modern deep learning approaches that combine the 3d flow regime of hydrological models with time series of biological quality elements from a wider set of ecosystem services with such a system at hand it may be possible to implement also better screening criteria than the simplistic maximum eqr changes used here precautionary assessed at 0 05 eqr reduction for fish comparable to something in the range of more than 20 probability of change e g for good to moderate habitat state for fish with such stressors added simply relating these to fish eqr for a single species might not be enough and instead more species should be considered in order to cover the most relevant stressors finally there is a need to calibrate and validate not only the hydrological models but also the empirical equations but this ask for timeseries of fish eqr observations which at the present moment are not readily available in the simulations for future climate we have limited the focus to changes in instream flow conditions and in fish eqr based on methods applied for rbmp in denmark thus we have incorporated frequency fre25 and fre75 and predictability of flow defined by bfi we have analysed how the future climate will impact these hydrological regime variables and impact fish eqr we haven t evaluated how the proxy variable for physical conditions meandering sin could be impacted by climate change and adaption measures nor have we explored the significant shifts in the timing of annual extreme flow dosdogru et al 2020 adversely impacting life cycle the added flow indicators q95 q50 as part of eq 2 q95 and flow calendar enable a quantitative screening of relevance for upper reaches and small streams where eq 1 is not valid catchments 10 km2 in large part of europe and denmark upper stream reaches are dominated by cold water species like trout salmon with the projected temperature increases for rcp8 5 of 3 4 degree for 2071 2100 for denmark pasten zapata et al 2019 these habitats are especially vulnerable pletterbauer et al 2018 an important aspect not included here is habitat connectivity since species will follow their preferred thermal nices and deep pools with high groundwater exhange flows can provide valuable habitats during more frequent droughts and heatwaves 5 conclusion to cover the variability in climate model projections three gcm rcm model combinations were selected covering a range from dry to median to wet climate model all three driven by the emission scenario rcp8 5 hydrological and eco flow models were constructed and tested in two large scale catchments the experiment results in significant changes in the freshwater cycle with climate factors above 1 5 2 for some flow components groundwater recharge and groundwater level rank similar to the ranking of climate models based on precipitation increase for october march the impact of climate change on monthly flow and flow calendar follows the same pattern at all monitoring stations while the impact on groundwater level and fish eqrs are complex and to some degree ambiguous results across realisations and catchments are found fish eqr based empirical equations eq 1 advance and improve analysis by increasing the degree of explanation compared to low flow focused approaches eq 2 as documented by the results for ringkøbing and mid zealand catchments as discussed in this paper there is a need for further development of empirical equations when such are used for climate change impact studies especially it should be attempted to include variables describing peak flows e g q01 and similar in the fish eqr equation since impact of max flow is significant in climate change since physical based distributed hydrological and groundwater models enable description of soil moisture phreatic depth to groundwater groundwater discharges to streams from deep and shallow groundwater aquifers variables from hydrological models can provide co variates of value for further development of fish eqr indices to be used on a catchment level relationships between flow and biology should be based on a much larger dataset than 60 100 biological locations with observed flow relationships between modelled flows groundwater levels water balance etc and biology could reduce uncertainties caused by extrapolation and allow for cross validation of fish eqr datasets based on timeseries instead of steady state assessments steady state does not exist in reality and we should by all means avoid that business as usual prevails into 2100 because impacts will then be a hard problem for society due to substantial flooding and drought events far beyond the well fare and water secure society climate adaptation need to focus on the water balance for the catchment in order to identify robust measures which can work for rare events as well as for more frequent events and utilizing the increased reliability due to projected increases in spring and winter flows which has potential to mitigate the expected future water deficit in summer adaptation should be able to match what has been seen in recent years with long standing droughts in 2018 19 and prolonged wet periods in 2017 and 2019 2020 with the climax in february 2020 resulting in a 100 year max runoff event in

8271,study region two large scale catchments in denmark ringkøbing fiord and mid zealand catchments study focus future changes in hydrological regime extremes groundwater levels and ecological quality ratio eqr for fish were assessed based on an ensemble of 17 bias corrected regional climate models forced by the emission scenario rcp8 5 a dry a medium and a wet model were identified for the future period 2071 2100 changes in water balances for catchments impacts on groundwater level and fish ecological quality ration fish eqr were evaluated the impact changes were based on an integrated transient coupled groundwater and surface water flow model set up with a horizontal resolution of 200m 200m for the two catchments new hydrological insights for the region strengths and weaknesses of eqr assessments based on symbolic regression methods compared to expert assessments based on flow calendar and max flow changes in percent exceedance thresholds q95 were identified while the modelled impact of climate change on monthly flow and flow calendar follows the same pattern at all monitoring stations the impact on groundwater level and fish eqrs are more complex and somewhat ambiguous across realisations and catchments keywords climate change impacts groundwater fish eqr hydrological modelling and denmark 1 introduction the european water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec wfd was designed to achieve good ecological status in most european rivers lakes and wetlands and at the same time to assure good quantitative and chemical status of groundwater bodies by 2015 quevauviller et al 2011 although climate change is not explicitly included in the wfd the instructed step wise and cyclic approach of the river basin management planning process makes it well suited to adaptively manage climate change impacts issues like water availability groundwater level and river flow intensity and frequency of extreme events floods and drought episodes and water quality and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems require a model based approach to quantify the impact of future climate changes on flow regime groundwater recharge groundwater level and ecological quality ratio eqr furthermore robust and adaptive river basin management measures should be identified and implemented and uncertainty should be embraced by using a range of climate models and emissions scenarios european commission 2009 in order to protect the environment and prepare for extreme water related events the eu guidance document on climate change provides 11 key guiding principles european commission 2009 these recommend that direct and indirect climate pressures should be properly evaluated climate signals should be monitored in order to react when signals emerge monitoring should focus on reference sites without other anthropogenic impacts in order to distinguish between impacts from human activities and climate change in denmark sustainable groundwater abstraction considers two aspects 1 aquifer safe yield and 2 ecological flow aquifer safe yield is calculated based on modelled groundwater abstractions and fluxes into groundwater bodies the fraction between accumulated groundwater abstraction and accumulated recharge is calculated for screening purposes henriksen and refsgaard 2013 henriksen et al 2008 the following definition of sustainable groundwater abstraction safe yield has been proposed by henriksen and refsgaard 2013 the safe yield of a groundwater aquifer is the amount of groundwater which can be pumped from an aquifer without unacceptable negative impacts on groundwater level and water quality compared to pre developmental virgin situation the wfd recommends that an aquifer water balance is established and a sustainable fraction for supporting aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems is estimated in denmark assessment of ecological flow european commission 2015 acreman 2016 impacts caused by groundwater abstraction 99 of all water consumption is based on groundwater are considered based on acceptable changes in eqr for macroinvertebrates dvfi and fish dffva these are inspired by the wider literature on ecological flow and relationships between flow regime alteration and ecological response and use of ecological indicators to develop environmental flow standards poff et al 2010 hoekstra et al 2012 liu et al 2020a b in the literature the ecological flow is defined as the environmental flow requirements are the important flow regime characteristics i e the quantity frequency timing and duration of flow events rates of change and predictability variability that are required to maintain or restore the natural flow regime in order to maintain specified valued features of the ecosystem henriksen and refsgaard 2013 the european member states divide the eqr for each surface water category into five classes by means of a threshold value for the biological quality elements which shows the demarcation between those different classes namely high good moderate poor and bad the approach taken has been to design flow biota relationships graeber et al 2014 2017 poff and zimmermann 2010 between flow regime variables and the ecological quality ratio for three biotic indices for macroinvertebrates macrophytes and fish based on a number of danish stream sites based on 72 flow regime variables symbolic regression was used to develop a number of models that could potentially predict the relationship between flow regime variables and eqr for fish macroinvertebrates and macrophytes graeber et al 2014 the range of possible values of eqr 0 1 are then classified into a semiquantitative ecological status and the variation of eqr values are then modelled as a function of environmental variables using hydrological regime metrics the variation in hydrological metrics depends upon the intensity of groundwater abstraction and climate variability change effects this variation can be estimated from dynamical groundwater surface water models and climate projection finally the effects of actual intensity of groundwater abstraction on the fish and macroinvertebrate based eqr are estimated henriksen et al 2019 an alternative approach for evaluating flow impacts on fish is based on the so called flow calendar as proposed by olsen et al 2013 here acceptable changes in flow are evaluated for different seasons the paper discuss strengths and weaknesses of the alternative approaches for small headwater streams and larger streams and the need for developing either more accurate empirical formulas including also temperature water quality and a wider set of stressors or to further develop the flow calendar approach another overall aim of using modelling to monitor the freshwater cycle is to strengthen the assessment of different water balance elements through a combined use of monitoring and modelling data henriksen et al 2008 this is particularly the case for fish eqr dffva evaluation as neither groundwater recharge nor impacts from climate change and groundwater abstraction can be measured directly liu et al 2020a b has shown examples for such quantifications of the effects of groundwater abstraction liu et al 2020a and climate change impacts liu et al 2020b for the uggerby river catchment in northern jutland denmark based on swat modflow with flow biota empirical models the fish index and macrophyte index were shown to be the most responsive to climate change changes however with a complex pattern liu et al 2020b and large regional differences in flow regime alteration due to future increase or decrease in flow flow regime alteration induced by climate change may benefit rainbow trout due to positive response to increase in winter high flows wenger et al 2011 but a future decrease of streamflow or higher frequency of low flow events in future climate could lead to the opposite effects during situations of prolonged drought elimination some biota leading to lower species diversity bunn and arthington 2002 flow regime shifts induced by effects of climate change can therefore improve ecological state in some streams and reduce state in others cui et al 2018 the purpose of the paper is to quantify climate induced changes in water balances hydrological regime groundwater level and fish eqr for two case studies and to discuss strengths and weaknesses of the empirical based danish approach for three selected climate models dry median and wet under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 business as usual the novelty of the work is that we have used an integrated transient coupled groundwater and surface water flow model mike she mike hydro with three bias corrected climate models to assess the impacts of climate change on hydrological regimes and fish eqr in two large scale catchments for a comprehensive analysis of impacts on fish eqr the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the approach for hydrological modelling selection of climate models used for projections and hydrological model simulations and indicators in section 3 results of the performance test of the model are presented climate change impacts on water balance extreme runoff groundwater level and fish eqr are presented section 4 discuss the results and conclusions are found in section 5 2 methods 2 1 case studies and hydrological models ringkøbing fiord catchment is located in the western part of denmark fig 1 between the jutland ridge and the west coast van roosmalen et al 2009 the topography varies from 125 m above sea level masl in eastern part to zero at the western coast climate is of maritime regime dominated by westerly winds and extratropical cyclones with mild winters and relatively cold summers with frequent rainfall from 1989 2017 the annual mean precipitation was 888 mm per year in the ringkøbing fjord catchment with the driest year reaching 597 mm yr and the wettest year 1054 mm year similarly the mid zealand catchment has an annual mean precipitation of 719 mm year with the extreme dry year reaching 509 mm yr and the wettest year reaching 943 mm yr for both catchments autumn and winter are the wet seasons whereas spring is the dry season the annual mean temperature between 1989 and 2017 in the ringkøbing fjord catchment is 8 5 c the annual mean temperature in the mid zealand catchment is 8 8 c for both sites temperature is low for winter and autumn reaching monthly mean temperatures of 1 3 c in contrast the warmest temperatures are observed during july and september the area has in general highly permeable soils and discharge to the streams is dominated by groundwater base flow the mid zealand catchment fig 2 is characterized by glaciomorphological topography henriksen et al 2003 with a near surface geology consisting of quaternary deposits overlying tertiary limestone and marls chalk aquifers shallow runoff drainage flow dominates the discharge pattern while groundwater recharge to the chalk aquifers is more limited the impacts from the purely groundwater based irrigation require a fully coupled numerical groundwater and surface water flow model the hydrological modelling software used in this study is mike she mike hydro version 2019 an integrated physically based and distributed hydrological model abbott et al 1986 in this study the hydrological modelling setup is based on a refined version of the national water resource model stisen et al 2018 that describes all the major processes of the hydrological cycle precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff groundwater recharge abstraction and irrigation drainage flow and groundwater discharge to surface water lakes and the sea henriksen et al 2008 højberg et al 2012 2015 sonnenborg et al 2003 stisen et al 2012a b the underlying geological model is discretized into a 100 m 100 m grid stisen et al 2019 and the hydrological model has a horizontal grid size of 200 m 200 m which is a significant refinement compared to the national water resource model where a grid size of 500 m 500 m is applied river routing is simulated by mike hydro using a kinematic routing method stisen et al 2018 compared the results of this relatively simple solution with a hydrodynamic solution and concluded that it is a reliable approach for simulating runoff and water level for most discharge stations the performance was acceptable compared to screening criteria for nash sutcliffe efficiency and water balance furthermore larger models using the kinematic routing solution are running 20 50 times faster which is important for detailed models of large catchments as investigated here daily output time steps of both simulated discharge and hydraulic head elevation were specified in order to obtain reliable and accurate results results on discharge are calculated at every q point in the model setup that are located at a mutual distance of approximately 100 m modelling of drainage flow from agricultural areas is important in relation to hydrological regime variables groundwater drainage including both natural and artificial drainage is simulated dynamically as a function of groundwater level in mike she in this setup the drainage flux is generated once the groundwater level is above the defined drainage level and it is removed from the saturated zone by a rate controlled by the drainage time constant and routed to surface water bodies or beyond the model boundaries by following a topographical grid code map butts and graham 2005 drain level and time constant are distributed based on drain class undrained built up near natural forest intensive agriculture and extensive agriculture in addition to this the model drain level has been scaled based on land surface elevation variability within each model grid the higher the standard deviation of the 10 m dem elevation values within the respective model grid the higher drain depth has been assumed in the 200 m model stisen et al 2018 stisen et al 2019 in the projection to future climate a sea level rise of 1 m has been incorporated in the modelling of groundwater level and flow a total of 250 small streams were added to the river network for the ringkøbing fiord catchment and 10 streams to the mid zealand catchment furthermore gradient boundary flux conditions were applied to the model boundaries based on observed piezometric head measurements and fluxes simulated across boundaries in fig 1 model areas and river networks are shown monitoring stations including performance test results for nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and mean error me for 1989 2018 are indicated by the symbol colours finally the quantitative performance of the refined model setups was compared with results of the national model in order to validate the used setups and the qualitative performance was visually checked for selected time series against monitoring data for 1989 2018 2 2 climate modelling a subset of 16 regional climate models rcm from the euro cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 are analysed in this study all models are forced by the rcp 8 5 pathway moss et al 2010 as this is the scenario that reproduces the current emission trajectory more accurately hayhoe et al 20172017 all models are forced by the rcp 8 5 emission scenario moss et al 2010 the spatial resolution of the models is 0 11 degree 12 5 km at a daily time step when compared to the observations the raw simulation results from the rcms generally show systematic biases ehret et al 2012 therefore the climate model outputs used in this study are statistically bias corrected using a distribution based approach and downscaled to match the observation grid from the danish meteorological institute dmi cells at 10 10 km for precipitation and 20 20 km for temperature the method is described in detail by pasten zapata et al 2019 and briefly involves matching the simulated distributions of precipitation and temperature to the distribution of the observations through statistical relationships such relationships are then used to correct the simulations of the climate projections from 1971 to 2100 it should be noted that there are different assumptions and limitations linked to the bias correction approaches such as the assumption of temporal stationarity of the statistical relationships the dependence on the bias correction period here 1990 2009 and the possible alteration of the climate change signal the reader is referred to the book by maraun and widmann 2018 for a detailed explanation of such limitations and assumptions the projected change in the seasonal mean precipitation and potential evapotranspiration by the end of the century 2071 2100 compared to the reference period 1981 2010 are estimated for each bias corrected rcm based on this information three models are selected representing dry median and wet projections gcm rcm dry ichec ec earth hirham median ichec ec earth racmo wet ipsl cmsa mr rca the three models project changes in precipitation during winter season where groundwater recharge in denmark is significant between 50 mm yr and 210 mm yr fig 3 summer precipitation is projected to increase by 25 mm 55 mm the three selected climate models cover the span in precipitation important for groundwater recharge and low flow in rivers the reason for selecting three models is to select the main variance among the 16 climate models in order to provide an accurate analysis of hydrological impacts pasten zapata et al 2019 2 3 methodology for analysing climate change s impacts on the hydrological regime the hydrological models were run with climate inputs from the three selected climate models in two 30 year periods from 1981 to 2010 and from 2071 2100 values of daily discharge and groundwater levels for 5 day intervals were generated for both the reference 1981 2010 and the future 2071 2100 periods and water balances were compiled for the land area monthly discharge and groundwater level data were calculated and extracted at selected monitoring wells and discharge stations flow duration curves annual maximum minimum and mean runoff were compiled and statistics were calculated changes in groundwater levels were evaluated finally ecological flow indicators for fish eqr dffva macroinvertebrates eqr dvfi and macrophytes eqr dvpi were calculated at all approximately 25 000 river calculation points in the following focus will be on fish eqr partly because dvpi is not used as part of rbmp2 and rbmp3 in denmark and partly because dvfi is not very sensitive to flow changes liu et al 2020b henriksen et al 2014 2 4 method for analysing fish eqr the empirical formulas for fish eqr are developed based on symbolic regression analysis for fish macrophytes and macro invertebrates carried out on observed data from different stream sites graeber et al 2014 yang et al 2008 of the indicators that are developed and implemented by use of a national water resources model henriksen et al 2014 fish eqr is the most restrictive and sensitive to flow changes since the metrics for fish eqr are normalised with median flow q50 to the interval from 0 to 1 acceptable changes in fish eqr values can be established and used for screening purposes henriksen et al 2014 the fish eqr is classified by the following thresholds high 0 94 good 0 72 0 94 moderate 0 40 0 71 poor 0 11 0 39 and bad 0 11 when calculating annual frequencies of events with flow above the 25th percentile from the flow duration curve fre25 and annual frequency of events with flows below the 75th percentile from the flow duration curve fre75 relative exceedance thresholds are defined from q25 and q75 for a selected period in this case based on the period 2004 2012 where both hydrological and biological data were available liu et al 2020b the indicator for fish fish eqr is presented in eq 1 validation tests have been carried out at 61 locations with a nash sutcliffe coefficient of 0 49 graeber et al 2014 the correlation of determination r2 was estimated as 0 53 p 0 001 see liu et al 2020b 1 fish eqr 0 058 s i n 0 319 0 811 b f i 0 050 f r e 25 0 0413 f r e 75 n 61 n s e 0 49 in eq 1 bfi is the dimensionless baseflow index baseﬂow volume divided by total ﬂow volume fre25 is the number of high flow events defined by average number of events on the hydrograph per year above the 25th percent exceedance flow value q25 fre75 is the number of low flow events per year and is defined as the average number of events below the 75th percentile q75 of the flow duration curve sin is the class of sinuosity with a value of 1 4 ranging from straight channels to meandering rivers n is the number of sites and nse is the nash sutcliffe coefficient a simpler formula eq 2 was derived by dce based on median minimum q medmin q flow dce 2019 2 f i s h e q r 0 314 0 468 m e d m i n q q 50 in eq 2 medmin q is the annual daily minimum flow statistically occurring every second year corresponding to the median value of the 30 annual minimum flow values the regression provided the following result n 62 nse 0 26 medmin q is assumed to represent the groundwater component of the stream flow and has previously been applied in denmark as part of the assessment of sustainable groundwater abstraction and as part of wfd rbmp1 gap analysis henriksen et al 2008 however the relationship in eq 2 was basically derived in the same way as eq 1 and based on the fish eqr approach where median minimum q as well as all other flow terms are normalised with q50 eq 1 was established as part of rbmp2 graeber et al 2014 as part of rbmp3 eq 2 was estimated as part of a further investigation of the approach based on a different dataset dce 2019 however for the gap analyses of rbmp3 eq 1 was chosen because of the higher degree of explanation of this formula nse 0 49 henriksen 2019 fish eqr is regarded as the most reliable empirical formula of those applied in denmark and eq 1 is currently used for screening purposes in relation to gap analysis of rbmp3 wfd in denmark when using eqs 1 or 2 the exceedance thresholds like q25 q50 and q75 are calculated for each scenario period e g the reference period and future periods before the number of events are calculated for every year for the period this differs from the way relative changes in flow was calculated previously henriksen et al 2008 where reference period minimum flow was used for calculating the relative change in all scenario periods with a threshold of e g 10 15 or 25 max reduction of flow depending on stream quality goals in reality since water abstraction in denmark is based on groundwater jørgensen et al 2016 the relative exceedance thresholds are controlled by complex hydrogeological relationships climate and abstraction type where irrigation has a strong seasonal variation whereas abstractions for waterworks and industry are more constant over the year therefore in order to assess the impact of groundwater abstraction on fish eqr a dynamic groundwater surface water model provides a valuable tool for identifying and evaluating climate change effects of percentiles q50 q95 etc and fish eqr based on eq 1 and 2 three different methods for quantifying changes in flow calendar fish eqr are compared method a is given by the relative change in q95 henriksen and refsgaard 2013 henriksen et al 2008 method a α a q 95 f u t q 95 r e f q 95 r e f the screening criteria for method a is given by a maximum of 10 reduction in low flow q95 corresponding to an unacceptable change of αa 10 as proposed by henriksen and refsgaard 2013 as a precautionary first step screening in a two step approach method b is defined by the absolute change in eqr based on the simplified eq 2 using medmin q q50 method b α b f i s h e q r f u t f i s h e q r r e f 0 468 m e d m i n q q 50 f u t m e d m i n q q 50 r e f method b is included here in order to investigate how this more simplified empirical formula with a lower nse compares to the more complex formula with the higher nse and to explore whether the simplified formula eventually could be more or less sensitive to climate induced changes in groundwater flow than method c see below method c is defined as the absolute change in eqr based on eq 1 method c α c f i s h e q r f u t f i s h e q r r e f 0 811 δ b f i 0 050 δ f r e 25 0 0413 δ f r e 75 where δ indicate the change between reference and future values the screening criteria for methods b and c are in this study defined as the maximum absolute reduction of fish eqr eq 1 and eq 2 equivalent to a maximum reduction in αb or αc of less than 0 05 this threshold has been chosen in order to apply a precautionary first step screening criteria if more than 20 of the stations exceed this criteria the screening is considered to be positive it should be noted that when method c is used as part of rbmp3 for screening in relation to impacts from groundwater abstraction a threshold of αc less than 0 23 is used as part of gap analysis henriksen et al 2019 which compares to more than 80 of the stations exceeding the criteria for each case study and method changes in statistics are calculated including i change in median value based on all q points with max 50 of q points exceeding the criteria ii as for i but a maximum of 20 of q points can exceed the criteria is evaluated assuming normal distribution and estimates of mean and standard deviation by use of error function 20 low limit value median 0 841 std dev and iii assuming that maximum 20 of the discharge monitoring stations exceed the screening criteria the so called flow calendar is based on monthly seasonal flow data at the monitoring q stations the eqr and flows representing given exceedance thresholds e g q25 or q75 where flow is exceeded 25 or 75 of time respectively are compared to the alternative flow calendar method the median change of flow for each month has been calculated based on selected stations from each case study here acceptable changes in flow are evaluated for different seasons and different trout life stages flow calendar results for fry juvenile adult and spawning are based on olsen et al 2013 l see table 1 denotes that low flow is considered critical h that high flow is considered critical while n denotes that flow is normally not critically blank cells denote periods where the trout life stage is normally not present in streams 3 results 3 1 performance of used 200m 200m models the results of the performance test are shown in table 2 the performance of the 200 m models for ringkøbing fiord and mid zealand are in general improved with respect to groundwater levels compared to the calibrated national water resource model dk model2019 the simulation of runoff for ringkøbing fjord nse is slightly worse than the 500 m model based on the performance results it was evaluated that the model performance is acceptable for evaluating climate change impacts stisen et al 2019 the performance of the mid zealand model is better for groundwater where rmse and mae are reduced significantly from 3 68 m to 2 87 m and from 3 64 m to 2 83 m respectively however this is obtained at the expense of a decrease in mean error the performance on stream discharge is improved with a nse value of 0 64 compared to the original value of 0 59 overall the mid zealand model is also found acceptable for the purpose of this study in the supplementary material see s1 examples of the flow duration curves are available for a selected subset of discharge stations in the two case areas here plots are available for these stations for observed climate input and for the performance run for the period 1989 2018 the flow duration curves show an acceptable fit for most of the discharge stations therefore q25 and q75 including changes in these values are reliable we have intermediate confidence in the model results for extreme high flow q1 and low flow q95 3 2 climate change impacts on hydrological regime the water balance for the three climate model runs was calculated for present and future 30 year periods in order to visualise the changes the water balance of the other models can be found in supplementary material see s2 a significant increase in precipitation from 1014 mm yr to 1132 mm yr is found this is to some degree counterbalanced by an increase in evapotranspiration of 74 mm yr from 527 mm yr to 601 mm yr and an increase in groundwater recharge infilt incl evap where a net increase of 33 mm yr from 469 mm yr to 502 mm yr is observed however climate change also affects the hydrogeological flow components where drain flow to streams sz drain to river is increased from 158 mm yr to 217 mm yr as a result of increasing and larger seasonal fluctuations in groundwater table also the upward transport of water from the root zone increases significantly implying that the vegetation is able to extract more groundwater smaller distance to the groundwater table higher demand the overall results of climate change impacts on water balances calculated as a climate factor for the three climate model scenarios are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the median climate model representing rcp8 5 for 2071 2100 for the ringkøbing catchment shows an increased groundwater recharge with a climate factor of 1 20 abstraction has a climate factor of 1 61 explained by the increased irrigation demand which is almost doubled for the median climate model by the end of this century climate factor 1 93 drainage flow is increased by a factor 1 37 and overland flow is increased by more than a factor of three whereas baseflow is only slightly increased in this scenario by a factor 1 07 the wet and dry models show the wide range between different climate models causing a span in recharge between 1 49 and 1 07 but with a doubling of irrigation amount and significant changes in drainage and overland flow runoff the results for the mid zealand catchment are in the same range with respect to groundwater recharge abstraction is unchanged since irrigation in mid zealand is not of explicit importance in the total water balance fig 4 shows different discharge results from two monitoring stations one from each catchment only results from the median climate model are presented the two other models can be found in supplementary material see s3 the results representing observed climate 1989 2018 cover almost the same period as those representing simulated climate in the reference period 1981 2010 and thus provides an opportunity for evaluating the bias correction and complement the cross validation analysis done by pastén zapata et al 2019 the results representing observed climate 1989 2018 cover almost the same period as those representing simulated climate 1981 2010 and thus provides an opportunity for evaluating the bias correction the bias correction is overall valid for monthly mean yearly max and min and for the flow duration curves however comparing the model results to observation data of minimum and maximum yearly flow on daily basis show some deviation especially for yearly minimum of station q580047 the results are still within the expected uncertainty keeping in mind that the model has only been calibrated on the national scale the purpose is not detailed modelling for climate change adaptation but rather a more strategic goal the reliability or confidence is high for monthly results in runoff and to some degree maximum runoff whereas confidence in simulated daily minimum values and climate factors are less reliable the flow duration curves shown in fig 4 show a rather good fit for most of the discharge stations therefore q25 and q75 including changes in these values are reliable we have intermediate confidence in the model results for extreme high flow q1 and low flow q95 monthly mean flows in winter are projected to increase significantly in the future and the monthly flow is almost doubled in february for ringkøbing fjord low flow is expected to increase for ringkøbing fjord catchment however for the mid zealand catchment a decrease in yearly monthly low flow which in the future tend to occur in september instead of august in the present climate for the dry climate model results for the mid zealand catchment show quite significant changes for summer months for some stations see supplementary material s4 with up to 40 reduction in monthly low flow the dry model for the ringkøbing fjord catchment shows a rather complex response with a decrease of 10 for most stations the discharge for the median climate model for the mid zealand catchment increase flows with 30 50 in winter months from december to march at most stations and also increase flow in most summer months see fig 4 for the ringkøbing fiord catchment the median climate model increase flows in all months with the highest increases in winter months 10 20 the wet model shows somewhat similar pattern however the increasing flow in winter months are more severe 30 50 see supplementary material s4 the dry model shows relatively smaller gains in winter months and reduced flows in summer months in fig 5 the depth to shallow groundwater table phreatic depth and change in groundwater level for the median climate model for ringkøbing are shown the overall median and standard deviation of the change in shallow groundwater level for catchment from the reference period to the future period for all climate models is shown in table 4 the depth to shallow groundwater follows in general the same ranking as the wet median and dry model and the ranking of groundwater recharge for ringkøbing there are generally many areas with a depth to the groundwater of more than three meters and up to about 10 m the median model produces more moderate changes typically 25 50 cm at individual sites up to 2 m and in many areas unchanged groundwater levels wet model result in larger increases in level the dry model mainly point to an unchanged or descending groundwater table in some places locally up to one meter or locally more in the dry model in some areas a decrease of approximately 1 2 m is simulated the same overall picture if found for mid zealand but since evapotranspiration is much higher on the clayey moraine till increases in groundwater level are less than for ringkøbing and areas with decreasing shallow groundwater levels are in some areas larger it can be seen from fig 5 that the changes in groundwater level in general are most significant in areas with the largest depth to the phreatic surface whereas floodplain areas show more limited changes it should be noted that the results shown in fig 5 in table 5 the overall results from the three climate model projections in the two catchments are listed for simulated changes in monthly flow for the flow calendar periods as listed in table 1 climate change has positive impacts on fish spawning for most realisations but not for the dry climate model in july september low flow is considered critical to some degree all year round for spawning and since the wet and median models show increased flow better spawning conditions are expected in general for ringkøbing and mid zealand catchments for trout or salmon fry high flows are considered critical for april june and low flows for july september here model results reveal that the wet and median models generally show increased flow which therefore could be considered less favourable for fry however the same models show improved or unchanged conditions for july september due to increased flow so the impact on fry based on flow results only may not be critical compared to other stressors finally for juvenile trout 7 20 cm and adult trout 20 cm low flow is considered critical in summer half april june and july september in general the wet and median models show improved conditions for trout whereas the dry model shows negative changes due to less flow for future period compared to present 3 3 climate change impacts on fish eqr figs 6 and 7 show simulated changes in fish eqr calculated with eq 1 for wet median and dry climate model and with calculated mean and standard deviation for all q points within each catchment the results for ringkøbing fiord catchment fig 6 show that the wet and the dry climate models provide mixed dominated by white reaches or negative impacts dominated by yellow reaches belonging to the 20 50 probability for reduced ecological state median values of 0 007 to 0 030 and standard deviations from 0 090 to 0 052 are found the median climate model generally shows increased eqr values dominated by green reaches with a 20 50 probability of an improved ecological state with a mean value of 0 044 and a standard deviation of 0 053 this means that the median climate model does not result in a central estimate of the three selected models and that the patterns are complex when it comes to impacts on fish eqr the results for eqr dffva for the mid zealand catchment fig 7 show a different pattern of complexity where an overall large reduction in eqr is found for the wet model with a mean of 0 06 and a standard deviation of 0 089 the median model has a similar but less strong pattern mean value of 0 027 and standard deviation of 0 071 the dry model shows the largest increase in eqr in general mean of 0 018 and standard deviation of 0 052 in this case the median climate model is in between wet and dry model in table 6 statistics are show for 14 selected monitoring stations in ringkøbing fiord catchment and 21 q stations in mid zealand catchment with calculated changes in q1 q25 q75 and q95 results are given in for future period compared with reference period 1981 2010 the change in absolute eqr value for future minus reference periods is also listed according to table 6 the impact of climate change on flow conditions is significant in both catchments all percentiles are affected however the most severe impact is found for high flows q1 q25 the impact on the eqr is for most realisations moderate in no cases the eqr indicator changes by more than one probability class in the ringkøbing catchment in the mid zealand catchment changes by more than one probability class or 0 05 are only found at two monitoring stations table 7 shows results for methods a b and c are shown together with screening results for median change and an estimate of 20 of points exceeding screening criteria estimated as median change 0 841 std dev assuming normally distributed values iii is number of monitoring stations based on table 6 assessed table 7 shows that all realisations have more than 20 of qpoints with reductions in q95 method a ii above screening criteria and the dry model also exceeds the criteria for 50 of qpoints method a i method a underline an issue with low flows that are projected to reduce in future climate in a significant part of the catchment for the dry model in both catchments moving to the eqr based approaches method b with the simplified formula using medmin q q50 and method c with bfi fre25 and fre75 show more ambiguous results only the wet model for mid zealand exceeds the criteria for 50 of qpoints i but for two out of three realisations the criteria is exceeded if only 20 of qpoints are allowed to exceed the criteria contrary to method a methods b and c do not categorise the dry model for mid zealand fig 6b as critical when the evaluation is only based on discharge monitoring stations iii the results are more or less similar to i and ii 4 discussion 4 1 screening the impacts of climate change on hydrological regime flow alteration for the ringkøbing fiord catchment the three selected realisations wet median and dry model are representative samples of the overall ensemble the 16 climate model realisations for rcp8 5 when ranked by overall recharge or runoff magnitude there is uncertainty in the projected changes associated with the choice of concentration pathways therefore using all available pathways could give an insight of the total uncertainty coming from the potential scenarios nevertheless rcp 8 5 reproduces the current emission trajectory better than the other pathways due to the skill of rcp 8 5 it is comprehensive to use this pathway as driver of the projections in contrast to using the other pathways which are not able to accurately reproduce the current emission trajectory the dry climate model has the lowest or second lowest rainfall for october march among the 16 ensemble models the wet climate model has the second highest rainfall in october march finally the median climate model is fourth lowest in terms of october march rainfall for mid zealand the picture for the winter period is about the same although the wet climate model here is only the third highest among the climate models for april september all three climate models are placed centrally in the ensemble and therefore do not represent the total spread in either precipitation or evaporation for april september this eventually can explain why mid zealand in general has a more pessimistic outlook compared to ringkøbing fiord catchment which overall has a more positive outlook in terms of increased flows compared to the flow calendar the overall changes are ideal for nurturing fish habitats based on the historical climate input data for the period 1989 2018 the precipitation is significantly higher for ringkøbing fjord catchment 989 mm year compared to mid zealand 740 mm year evapotranspiration amounts to 546 mm year for central zealand while a slightly lower value of 520 mm year is found for ringkøbing fjord catchment due to sandy soils and lower root zone capacity for ringkøbing compared to mid zealand moraine till groundwater recharge is therefore significantly higher for ringkøbing fjord catchment amounts to 493 mm year compared to mid zealand amounts to 208 mm year climate projections result in significant increases in all flows in the catchment water balance terms from 1981 to 2010 to 2071 2100 by 7 27 for precipitation 13 17 for evapotranspiration and 7 49 for groundwater recharge for the dry median and wet realisation irrigation demand for ringkøbing increases by 87 123 drainage increases by 3 90 base flow increases by 0 21 and shallow run off increases by 26 281 for the three realisations it is noteworthy that changes in groundwater recharge are larger than changes in annual rainfall the results confirm earlier findings by van roosmalen et al 2009 didovets et al 2019 chase et al 2016 eum et al 2017 and müller wohlfeil et al 2000 from northern europa and north america evaluating an expected increase in groundwater recharge and runoff in winter and spring and increased evapotranspiration in summer all these changes are favourable with a flow calendar assessment for ringkøbing fiord catchment but less favourable for mid zealand due to the in general more dry summer conditions and an increase in evapotranspiration exceeding the increase in precipitation on the clayey soil these results confirm that water balance is key to projected climate generated flooding and drought risks showing complex pictures depending on selected gcm rcm and rcp didovets et al 2019 eum et al 2017 see s2 and s3 for more details on changes in water balance and streamflow changes in shallow groundwater levels are largest for areas with the largest depth to groundwater which is also in agreement with previous studies van roosmalen et al 2009 however the pattern is more detailed in the present model version due to the 200m 200m grid size and a more detailed river network in addition the present study included predicted sea level rise for the future situation 2071 2100 which impact groundwater level changes in the vicinity of ringkøbing fiord and the north sea coast irrigation demand in ringkøbing is simulated to almost double for all three models for future climate in a range comparable to what was estimated previously by van roosmalen et al 2009 for the sres emission scenario a2 ipcc 2000 using a hydrological model with a more coarse grid in the projections of future increase in irrigation due to changes in precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration we have calculated with our hydrological model an increase in irrigation for wet median and dry climate model for rcp8 5 and far future between 87 and 123 for the ringkøbing catchment which is one of the intensively irrigated catchments of denmark see table 3 for historical climate the irrigation amount to 21 mm year in average for the catchment area this change in future groundwater based irrigation demand impacts infiltration soil moisture evapotranspiration groundwater recharge streamflow and ultimately fisheqr van roosmalen et al 2009 evaluated for the same catchment an irrigation of 18 mm year and an increase of 87 for a2 scenario a2 is comparable to rcp8 5 which is in a similar range as our estimate liu et al 2020b estimated an increase for rcp8 5 in average irrigation amount of 31 48 mm year for uggerby å however as an average for irrigated land and not catchment and thus a significant average increase similar to our model simulations for ringkøbing fjord catchment for ringkøbing a significant increase in monthly flow for february is simulated above 50 increase for mid zealand forced by the wet climate model a doubling of flow is simulated while a smaller but still significant increase in flow is found for the median climate model the impacts of the dry model was moderate in general the results show that daily high flow percentiles q1 are increased significantly whereas daily low flow percentiles q95 show a more complex change pattern for some stream reaches and forcings with both increasing and decreasing low flow van roosmalen et al 2009 simulated an increase in monthly flow for february around 35 and a decrease for september for skjern å downstream part st 22 14 of 15 for a2 scenario liu et al 2020b for uggerby river catchment downstream part subbasin 18 for rcp8 5 simulated the largest relative increase to happen in january 16 increase for february an 13 increase and the largest decrease for july was simulated to 20 compared to these figures and including the results for q01 and q95 our model agree more or less about the increase in monthly high flow for february with the study of van roosmaalen et al 2009 but the impact on low flow seems to be more moderate with changes in minimum flow rather stable in the future climate compared to present climate but with significant increases in high flow these differences may be due to several factors hydrological model and process description model structure differences bias correction where we used a dual distribution based scaling methodology pasten zapata et al 2019 on a 10 10 km scale for precipitation and 20 20 km scale for evapotranspiration there is a difference in model resolution van roosmaalen et al 2009 applied a 1 1 km hydrological model we used a 200 200 m model and other factors can be representation of groundwater abstraction soil land use geology etc the applied mike she model was discretized into more than 15 calculation layers for saturated zone and the river network was fairly detailed however for the dry model q95 is reduced for both case studies the median and dry models reveal that in many reaches q95 have decreased by more than 10 which is an older screening criteria henriksen and refsgaard 2013 henriksen et al 2008 in relation to minimum flow and impacts on spawning and nursery reaches could therefore be critical if some reaches dry up during dry spell events of longer duration at several discharge stations and reaches reductions by more than 20 and at a few above 40 are found contrary to this the wet climate model results in increased low flow q95 for mid zealand the patterns are even more complex but due to increased evapotranspiration for the eastern denmark case study all three climate models result in a significant number of critical reaches when using the previously suggested 10 low flow maximum reduction screening criteria henriksen and refsgaard 2013 it should be noted that the simulated changes in low flow are in addition to the impacts from all current abstractions in the two areas henriksen et al 2019 which reveal that climate change is more critical for fish eqr than groundwater abstractions this implies that climate change cause a more extreme hydrological regime for rcp8 5 2071 2100 eum et al 2017 as highlighted by liu et al 2020b climate change can affect stream ecosystems through flow regime alterations that are particularly complex in catchments with significant groundwater contribution as ringkøbing fiord catchment but we also see complex alterations for the mid zealand catchment due to the chalk aquifer and complex drainage flow discharges and adverse impacts from increased evapotranspiration due to clayey soil and larger root zone soil moisture storage capacity conditions stein et al 2017 suggested that for reaches with good biology i e in our case good ecological status for fish in large and small streams it is important to monitor for factors that may reduce resilience falkenmark et al 2019 unfortunately the discharge monitoring stations may not be located in the reaches where we see the largest impacts on ecological quality ration eqr for fish many smaller and some larger reaches are today in poor biological quality for fish moderate poor or bad status and for such reaches flow management could be a measure including evaluation of hydrologic alteration among other stressors furthermore the groundwater monitoring network are not placed at the locations with the largest simulated increases in shallow groundwater level there is a need to extend the quantitative monitoring network with additional monitoring stations in streams and groundwater that are sensitive to climate changes 4 2 strengths and weaknesses of the eqr fish empirical approach for april september the dry climate model projects a relatively high rainfall amount compared to other climate models at the high end of the ensemble with respect to precipitation which could explain why fish eqr based approaches do not evaluate the dry realisation as a critical state in this respect method c that incorporates fish eqr building blocks like base flow index predictability of flow high flow pulses fre25 and low flow events below q75 fre75 do a better job compared to more traditional flow change methods method a however fish eqr do not capture radical and extreme low flow for such events where groundwater and daily minimum low flow is reduced the most resulting in the largest footprint in terms of drying up of the headwater reaches method a may be needed as an additional methodology for small streams 10 km2 on the larger flood plains of ringkøbing fiord catchment characterized by sandy soils with widespread and intensive groundwater based irrigation the changes in groundwater level are small or none fig 5 bottom this is explained by 1 increased evapotranspiration from river valleys and 2 increased irrigation demand at the agricultural fields which in dry periods lead to increased groundwater abstraction resulting in decreased annual minimum low flows in these areas we can see a general reduction in eqr for many larger reaches especially for the dry model when using relative reduction of q95 method a and medmin q q50 method b for the wet and median models but not for the dry model but eventually as mentioned above this could be due to the lack of extreme summer precipitation in the selected dry realisation however this highlights the ambiguity which can be diagnosed in situations where flow regime has complex impacts in this case q50 is more reduced relative to medmin q this illustrates the challenges with normalised empirical equations derived from a set of spatially distributed discharge stations and used for a temporal analysis of changes in fish eqr the strong side of fish eqr is that such formulas can be used for increases in flow which is not possible for method a as illustrated by the flow calendar this approach attempt to look out for both increased and decreased flow therefore it can be a supplementary approach in line with method a but with a more general applicability but if the low degree of explanation is also taken into consideration nse 0 26 for empirical formula for method b method b do not provide any real improvement of method c used for danish rbmp2 and 3 even though it illustrates how fish eqr indicators are more focused on extremity than amount of flow and extreme instead of mean conditions when using method c the rcp8 5 scenario turns out to have an improved fish eqr value it is not fully clear why method c produces this result we can only speculate that the number of pulses for fre25 may be increased and or that fre75 may be decreased or bfi increased for future compared to present climate when comparing results based on larger catchments only ii and iii show similar results in the study by liu et al 2020b for uggerby river catchment in northern zealand the fish indices fish eqr were most responsive in the large and some small streams decreasing up to 14 whereas in the median and some small streams the fish eqr benefitted from climate change by showing an increase of up to 14 these findings are in line with our findings from ringkøbing catchment and confirm the importance of a comprehensive hydrological modelling of the complex patterns for especially groundwater dominated catchments as explained by liu et al 2020b bfi generally increased in the rcp8 5 scenario for uggerby catchment while the value of weak peak flow events fre25 decreased low flow events frequency fre75 increased in large streams but decreased in medium streams or were unchanged in small streams the projected changes in especially the difference between fre25 and fre75 explains why the fish eqr changes for ringkøbing catchment decrease for some large streams like omme river and skjern river but it also highlights a need for investigating whether peak flow variable like q01 max runoff which are significantly impacted by climate change as shown in rcp8 5 for ringkøbing and with extreme changes for the mid zealand catchment where max flow increase by several magnitudes for mid zealand the fish eqr based screening methods methods b and c agree with the relative reduction of the low flow approach method a with respect to the wet and median models but disagree when it comes to the dry model when combining method a and method c as suggested above for ringkøbing all three realisations show that rcp8 5 is problematic for fish eqr for the eastern part of denmark since screening yield a result above the threshold both for small and large streams especially for smaller streams there are sources of uncertainty which should be mentioned liu et al 2020a since only a few observed eqr values for fish has been collected for such waters method a however is not a perfect method as also documented by graeber et al 2014 as also shown in this manuscript uncertainty in annual daily low flow is very significant and that also impact median minimum low flow a better approach could therefore be to further develop the flow calendar method and include this in the assessment when doing so the flow calendar may conclude that too much flow may be a more general problem than too little flow 4 3 the need for methodological development and a wider set of stressors the fish eqr indicators method c including baseflow index fre25 fre75 and meandering of riverline as a proxy variable for physical conditions in streams has a good degree of explanation but is not fully applicable for small streams 10km2 a way forward could be to include more stressors of relevance like water quality land use changes bank erosion temperature oxygen content etc villeneuve et al 2018 de vries et al 2019 pletterbauer et al 2018 in rbmp2 and 3 for denmark the most sensitive indicator has been eq 1 however as shown here for especially small streams an analysis based on 30 year statistics and empirical equations that do not consider flooding and drought events in a more comprehensive way is probably not adequate for analysis of climate forcing and impacts on biology it may be a problem that the model is too uncertain for implementing low flows like q95 and q95 q50 since it has not been specifically calibrated towards such metrics instead we may have to use a more robust measure that the model can simulate since the established empirical equations are based on observed discharge and observed fish eqr without any differential split sample validation and furthermore are extrapolated to flow regimes far away from the ones used for establishing the empirical formulas there is a clear knowledge gap furthermore based on the present analysis for two case studies it can be concluded that we need to rethink ecological quality ratio approaches since they are only based on steady state assumptions about flow for a 6 7 year period and has not been calibrated and cross validated against changing flow conditions an alternative and practical way forward could be to utilize the opportunities that more water in wet periods is predicted excess water may be stored and used in the more frequent dry periods with this perspective the way forward is to further develop the equations add more about physical conditions than meandering and incorporate for example water quality bank erosion oxygen temperature vegetation groundwater depths and exchange flow new equations should be derived using modern deep learning approaches that combine the 3d flow regime of hydrological models with time series of biological quality elements from a wider set of ecosystem services with such a system at hand it may be possible to implement also better screening criteria than the simplistic maximum eqr changes used here precautionary assessed at 0 05 eqr reduction for fish comparable to something in the range of more than 20 probability of change e g for good to moderate habitat state for fish with such stressors added simply relating these to fish eqr for a single species might not be enough and instead more species should be considered in order to cover the most relevant stressors finally there is a need to calibrate and validate not only the hydrological models but also the empirical equations but this ask for timeseries of fish eqr observations which at the present moment are not readily available in the simulations for future climate we have limited the focus to changes in instream flow conditions and in fish eqr based on methods applied for rbmp in denmark thus we have incorporated frequency fre25 and fre75 and predictability of flow defined by bfi we have analysed how the future climate will impact these hydrological regime variables and impact fish eqr we haven t evaluated how the proxy variable for physical conditions meandering sin could be impacted by climate change and adaption measures nor have we explored the significant shifts in the timing of annual extreme flow dosdogru et al 2020 adversely impacting life cycle the added flow indicators q95 q50 as part of eq 2 q95 and flow calendar enable a quantitative screening of relevance for upper reaches and small streams where eq 1 is not valid catchments 10 km2 in large part of europe and denmark upper stream reaches are dominated by cold water species like trout salmon with the projected temperature increases for rcp8 5 of 3 4 degree for 2071 2100 for denmark pasten zapata et al 2019 these habitats are especially vulnerable pletterbauer et al 2018 an important aspect not included here is habitat connectivity since species will follow their preferred thermal nices and deep pools with high groundwater exhange flows can provide valuable habitats during more frequent droughts and heatwaves 5 conclusion to cover the variability in climate model projections three gcm rcm model combinations were selected covering a range from dry to median to wet climate model all three driven by the emission scenario rcp8 5 hydrological and eco flow models were constructed and tested in two large scale catchments the experiment results in significant changes in the freshwater cycle with climate factors above 1 5 2 for some flow components groundwater recharge and groundwater level rank similar to the ranking of climate models based on precipitation increase for october march the impact of climate change on monthly flow and flow calendar follows the same pattern at all monitoring stations while the impact on groundwater level and fish eqrs are complex and to some degree ambiguous results across realisations and catchments are found fish eqr based empirical equations eq 1 advance and improve analysis by increasing the degree of explanation compared to low flow focused approaches eq 2 as documented by the results for ringkøbing and mid zealand catchments as discussed in this paper there is a need for further development of empirical equations when such are used for climate change impact studies especially it should be attempted to include variables describing peak flows e g q01 and similar in the fish eqr equation since impact of max flow is significant in climate change since physical based distributed hydrological and groundwater models enable description of soil moisture phreatic depth to groundwater groundwater discharges to streams from deep and shallow groundwater aquifers variables from hydrological models can provide co variates of value for further development of fish eqr indices to be used on a catchment level relationships between flow and biology should be based on a much larger dataset than 60 100 biological locations with observed flow relationships between modelled flows groundwater levels water balance etc and biology could reduce uncertainties caused by extrapolation and allow for cross validation of fish eqr datasets based on timeseries instead of steady state assessments steady state does not exist in reality and we should by all means avoid that business as usual prevails into 2100 because impacts will then be a hard problem for society due to substantial flooding and drought events far beyond the well fare and water secure society climate adaptation need to focus on the water balance for the catchment in order to identify robust measures which can work for rare events as well as for more frequent events and utilizing the increased reliability due to projected increases in spring and winter flows which has potential to mitigate the expected future water deficit in summer adaptation should be able to match what has been seen in recent years with long standing droughts in 2018 19 and prolonged wet periods in 2017 and 2019 2020 with the climax in february 2020 resulting in a 100 year max runoff event in

8272,study region pra river basin ghana west africa study focus in this study variations of the future streamflow in the pra river basin prb are projected using the soil and water analysis tool swat model with bias corrected climate data from regional climate models rcms for the near 21 st century 2010 2039 the mid 21 st century 2040 2069 and the end of the 21 st century 2070 2099 under two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 weighting scaling and ranking techniques were applied to the data from each of the seventeen climate stations to select the climate models that best reproduced the observation dataset new hydrological insights for the region the results from the calibration and validation r2 and nse 0 75 and pbias within 10 revealed good simulation of the prb hydrology from the swat model annually streamflow in the near and the mid 21st century is projected to increase within 4 and 12 while a reduction was projected at the end of the 21 st century with the rcp4 5 emission scenario the simulation results from the rcp8 5 scenario showed increase streamflow throughout the 21 st century applying the best performing models monthly streamflow variations varied between 15 and 23 for rcp4 5 and 24 to 24 for rcp8 5 generally increasing streamflow was highest in the rcp4 5 emission scenario in view of the model outcomes the prb is expected to experience upsurge in streamflow by the near and the mid of the 21 st century this would require proper planning by applying cost effective adaptative water management strategies to provide for the probable influence of climate change on the future water resources of the basin keywords weighting scaling and ranking techniques climate impact hydrological model streamflow pra river basin 1 introduction increasing temperature based on rcms data portrays that hydrological cycle might be altered as a result of increase in the water holding capacity of the atmosphere this will result in an upsurge of the quantity of renewable fresh water resources he et al 2017 hu and gao 2019 piani et al 2010 according to piani et al 2010 an increase in temperature for some regions may lead to reduction in precipitation linked to intensification in the seasonal cycle as well as frequency of extreme events this result suggests the existence of high uncertainties in the projected effects of increasing temperatures on the hydrology for some regions salack et al 2015 the reliability of rcms over west africa depends on their capability to reproduce observed climate data accurate modeling of many climate parameters however remains a challenging task for one particular rcm kabuya et al 2020 szabó takács et al 2019 shrestha et al 2017 schilling et al 2012 since each rcm simulates the individual climate parameter differently hydrological components response to climate change signal therefore appears unclear for west africa moreover most future climate impact assessment studies have been conducted with climate data from each climatic gauge stations derived from only one climate model output since the input components for climate models like land surface vegetation dynamics atmosphere sulphate and non sulphate aerosols sea and oceans vary at each climate gauge station using one output model may not be the best to reproduce the observed climate dataset at each climate gauge station for large basins this study therefore employed multi criteria evaluation mce to assess all the cordex africa model data at each climate gauge station using the multi criteria evaluation mce the best three models best b second best s and third best t for each gauge station were used to form three groups of scenarios for hydrological impact assessment in the prb the prb consists of rivers streams and forest areas which route large volumes of water it controls carbon and nutrient biogeochemistry and discharge carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere the basin supports various ecosystems and socio economic activities apart from the normal anthropogenic global warming activities such as urban expansions industrialization and expansion in agriculture at the expense of forest areas the prb is experiencing uncontrolled rapid illegal and small scale mining activities which are other sources of anthropogenic global warming in recent times the basin has encountered seasonal inadequacy in water availability making it one of the fastest water declining river basins globally awotwi et al 2018 water resources commission 2012 kusimi et al 2014 bessah et al 2019 thus there is a need to present accurate projections about the effect of future climate change on hydrological components within the prb for planning and managing the natural water resources for sustainable development though previous researches have evaluated the effects of projected climate change on water resources in west africa tall et al 2017 abubakari et al 2018 jin et al 2018 mbaye et al 2016 all relied on simulated hydrological components based on climate data simulated by a single rcm for the entire study areas this study broadly aims at estimating the future climate change influence on streamflow of the prb in ghana west africa by applying a wider dataset that will contribute to a meaningful knowledge for the planning and managing water resources in the region with sustainable developmental plans to accomplish this aim 1 all the co ordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa rcms were evaluated at each climate station using mce to select the rcms which best reproduce the observed data 2 assess the climate change signal for the near 21 st century mid 21st century and the end of the 21 st century while comparing it to the base period 1971 2005 and 3 evaluate the effects of climate change on the streamflow in the prb for the rest of the 21 st century using swat hydrologic model in west africa the swat model has been effectively used in hydrological assessments jin et al 2018 awotwi et al 2015b kankam yeboah et al 2013 mahé 2009 and therefore has the capability to simulate reliable hydrological components the outcomes obtained from this research are likely to give more understanding into the future water availability and to offer local water management agencies and policy makers with the quantifiable data for the suitable design management and the sustainability of water resources by factoring in climate adaptation policies to minimize vulnerability and guarantee water security for present and future generations design of adaptation policies to solve the possible effects of climate change on water resource structures is a substantial challenge for stakeholders in the water resources industry rashid et al 2019 dube and nhamo 2019 hirpa et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 noi and nitivattananon 2015 hassanzadeh et al 2016 according to the fifth assessments report of the ipcc 2014 the west african sub region shows little adaptive capability though it is extremely exposed to climate change projections for the 21 st century show austere effects of climate change on hydrology in the sub region these include an upsurge in the risk of water stress and flood yomo et al 2019 serdeczny et al 2017 acharya and prakash 2019 and vital alterations in river discharge khandekar et al 2019 sassi et al 2019 aich et al 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the prb fig 1 is located in the south central part of ghana and drains about 23 256 4 km2 the main pra river takes its source from the uplands of the kwahu plateau in the eastern region and flows for about 240 km before joining the atlantic ocean near shama in the western region after travelling through four administrative regions eastern ashanti western and central water resources commission 2012 with annual discharge of 214m3 s akrasi and ansa asare 2008 it consists of four major tributaries birim offin anum and oda rivers and densest network of streams besides the river network it contains the only notable natural freshwater lake in ghana lake bosomtwe the prb is one of the most widely and severely altered river basins in ghana due to expansion in settlement mining agriculture and logging as a result of its high mineral deposits and economic tree species and its favorable farming environment awotwi et al 2018 the vegetative cover of the basin had and still go through a rapid rate of deforestation attributable to these anthropogenic activities the basin experiences a sub equatorial climate with double rainy seasons may july as the major season and september november as the minor season awotwi et al 2017 spatially precipitation pattern increases from the north to south of the prb with a yearly mean precipitation of 1550 mm the mean minimum and maximum air temperatures are 23 c and 33 c respectively air temperature decreases towards the southern part of the prb awotwi et al 2017 the southern section of the basin is relatively flat while the mid to northern sections consist of few peaks with broad river valleys the prb further consists of extensive agricultural lands uncontrolled mining activities urban and rural settlement and industries which use large volumes of water these factors make evaluating the effect of future climate change on the local hydrology in the study area exceedingly important to help outline effective efficient and sustainable water resources management programs to guarantee availability of water for present and future generations 2 2 swat model input components the swat model needs topographic soil types and land use static data and hydro meteorological data dynamic data fig 2 to setup the model 2 2 1 digital elevation model the swat model needs topographic information for delineation of watershed and depicting of drainage trends of the land surface the dem 1 1000 000 at 30 m resolution obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm was corrected for sinks 2 2 2 land use land cover types the prb land use map needed by the hydrological model for hrus generation was obtained from the hybrid classification of 2016 enhanced thematic mapper etm landsat image lulc information is vital for water resources analysis and especially for modeling hydrological processes fig 3 a 2 2 3 soil types the soil types map fig 3b and its properties were obtained from the council for scientific and industrial research ghana soil database and the united nation s food and agriculture fao soil database in all six soil types were identified in the study area with acrisols covering over 75 of the prb the rest of the soil types are luvisols lixisols fluvisols leptosols and reclaimed soil 2 2 4 observed climate data daily time series precipitation and air temperatures minimum and maximum data for a period of 40 years 1970 2010 were obtained from the ghana meteorological agency gmet at seventeen climatic stations situated within and close to the basin but there were missing values in the data on average less than 7 for both precipitation and temperature the correlation weighting interpolated technique was used to estimate the missing values of climate data from some meteorological stations 2 3 homogeneity analysis of precipitation data as a result of changes in observational and measurement procedures environment landscapes and edifices and relocation of climate stations climate datasets could show inhomogeneity therefore homogenization analysis on climate data is a significant procedure to identify the changeability in the data this study used the standard normal homogeneity test snht proposed by alexandersson 1986 to assess the homogeneity per the null hypothesis the yearly values pi of the testing variables p are independent and evenly distributed therefore the data is termed homogeneous alternative hypothesis test presume that the data involves discontinuity in the mean and termed inhomogeneous the statistic s p which matches the average of the first p years to n p years is evaluated by 1 s p p z 1 n p z 2 p 1 2 3 4 n where 2 z 1 1 p i 1 n p i p σ a n d z 2 1 n p i p 1 n p i p σ p and σ average and the standard deviation respectively the year p is said to consist of break if the value of s is maximum to reject null hypothesis the test statistic 3 s 0 max 1 p n s p is greater than the critical value which is based on the sample size the method proposed by wijngaard et al 2003 was used to evaluate the homogeneity of the precipitation data at each climate station and using yearly average and yearly maximum as testing variables the yearly mean and maximum precipitation of each climate station were examined for homogeneity utilizing a critical value of 6 95 proposed by wijngaard et al 2003 2 4 model calibration and validation of flow discharge some parameters used by hydrological models cannot be measured directly in the field these parameters need to be adjusted to enhance the concurrence between observed and simulated values for this work the calibration and validation were done using a 31 year period daily observed discharge data 1 st january 1980 31st december 2010 at the daboase gauge station the outlet of the prb obtained from ghana hydrological service however there were missing values in the observed data which were less than 4 of the observed data three years data 1st january 1980 31st december 1982 were used to warm up the model while that of 1st january 1983 31st december 1998 and 1st january 1999 31st december 2010 were used for calibration and validation respectively employing a manual calibration method the model parameters were adjusted until the modeled discharge was within the statistically suitable model performance scope the gaps in the data were filled using the inverse distance weighting method with respect to the dunkwa on offin and twifo praso gauging stations in this study manual calibration which involves a trial and error method was adopted it was carried out on parameters that were most sensitive during sensitivity analysis abubakari et al 2018 the sensitivity analysis of the study was done with reference to the calibration periods on the optimization process that replicates the sensitivity of the 21 swat input parameters 1500 numbers of iterations were performed in gaining the most sensitive parameters after model calibration 12 years discharge data from the daboase station 1st january 1999 31st december 2010 was used for model validation the reliability of the simulation was assessed statistically by four indices nash sutcliff efficiency nse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 chu and shirmohammadi 2004 gupta et al 1999 and santhi et al 2011 respectively the assessment of the performance of the hydrological model is based on the statistical indicators nse pbias and rsr proposed by moriasi et al 2007 2 5 future climate change cc scenarios the ipcc representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were utilized as the principal tools for future climate change assessment because rcp8 5 is considered the strongest climate signal with the greatest atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in the late 21 st century while rcp4 5 presumes that emissions of greenhouse gases will soon become constant and then drop after a few decades van vuuren et al 2011 future precipitation and temperature data were obtained from outputs of nine gcms forcing six rcms table 1 from the cordex africa initiative the objective of cordex africa is to provide high resolution climate data for africa historical simulated data 1971 2005 was utilized as the reference epoch for this study the impending climate is characterized for three timeline scenarios 2010 2039 representing near 21st century ne 2040 2069 signifying mid 21st century md and 2070 2099 indicating the end of the 21st century ed 2 6 bias correction despite the fact that the models have been enhanced over time they still contain bias and is a source of worry in climate research uncorrected output from climate models makes it unreliable for effective hydrological studies therefore the usage of bias correction methods on the downloaded simulated climate data to improve the exactness of the modeled hydrological components to overcome this distribution mapping dm bias correcting method of cmhyd model rathjens et al 2016 was used to correct the bias this component has been extensively use in bias correction for climate change assessment studies schmidli et al 2006 olsson et al 2015 mbaye et al 2016 tschoke et al 2017 the rationale behind this method is to fit the parameters of transfer functions of climate modeled data to that of the measured data gamma and gaussian distributions transfer functions are used on precipitation and temperature respectively with the precipitation random precipitation intensity will first of all be definite and then employed to establish the cumulative probability of modeled precipitation after that centered on the cumulative probability the corrected precipitation value is chosen while for temperature the cumulative probability of modeled temperature data may well be established subsequently based on the probability the corrected temperature value can be chosen according to teutschbein and seibert 2012 this method of bias correction yields a very good result 2 7 weighting and ranking of climate models around the globe there are over thirty research groups that have established their own climate models though the foundation framework of these models is similar they all vary in their details in any instance the models must depict the physical collaborations between the atmosphere the oceans land surfaces and sea ice with reference to a multitude of processes functioning on various space and time scales climate model developers have different opinions about which physical components to emphasize thus at the same time different climate models produce different results at a location to produce reliable climate impact results this study compared all the cordex africa models output data with the observed data at each climate station this was achieved by first generating a taylor diagram for all the cordex africa models data for each climate station wet and dry season taylor diagrams for minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation the taylor diagram offers a statistical summary of how well the modeled patterns reproduce the observed patterns in terms of mean square error rmse correlation coefficient cc and normalized standardized deviation nsd it provides a diagram as a series of points on a polar plot consequently all these three statistical factors should be considered at the same time with equal weight in selecting the best model equal weights of 1 10 corresponding to worst to best reproduction of the observed climate dataset were placed on rmse cc and nsd of each climate model at each climatic gauge station using eqs 6 and 7 for precipitation the data was scaled down with 0 7 for wet season and 0 3 for dry season while temperature maximum and minimum were scaled by 0 5 for both wet and dry season fig 2 after which the sum of the weights were taken to institute the ranking of the climate models it is appropriate to arrange them based on the reducing value of their closeness coefficient of summation weights though it was tedious time consuming and expensive procedure it produces highly accurate data for the impact assessment then bias correction was applied to the best three models for each station before they were used to force the hydrological model swat 6 w t r m s e n s d 10 10 r m s e t d n s d t d r m s e t o n s d t o 7 w t

uncertainties but this is not possible to some extent each single data has some form of uncertainties therefore there are uncertainties related to this study according to walker et al 2003 uncertainty is any departure from complete deterministic knowledge of the relevant system therefore the uncertainty associated with this study was evaluated based on 8 d i f f e r e n c e e s b e t w e e n o b s e r v e d a n d b e s t s e c o n d b e s t t h i r d b e s t m o d e l o b s e r v e d 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation homogeneity from table 2 the entire seventeen stations reveled homogeneity in their precipitation under the testing variable of annual mean as the null hypothesis under the snht is not rejected at 0 05 level of significance whiles only one climate station precipitation data out of the seventeen stations portrayed homogeneity under the yearly maximum testing variable although inhomogeneous station was detected the outcomes are suitable since there is no much variation hence the stations can be used for further assessment 3 2 calibration and validation of swat the fourteen most sensitive parameters out of 21 obtained from the sensitivity analysis are shown in table 3 the scs runoff curve number cn2 was found to be the most sensitive parameters for the prb the final adjusted final values during calibration are shown in table 4 these parameters are substantially linked to surface runoff the comparisons of measured and simulated hydrographs for the calibration and validation epochs are shown in fig 4 the overestimation and underestimation of the simulated discharge might be due to the mistakes in measuring the input data as well as errors associated with the swat model the underestimation of the low flows may be as a result of more than one aquifer contributing to baseflow which is not dealt with in the swat model the graphs revealed a good agreement between measured and simulated streamflow values with r2 being 0 75 for both calibration and validation periods uncovering a decent agreement between the observed and the modeled discharge and least error variance between the two data sets moriasi et al 2007 moreover nse values of 0 75 and pbias values inside the scope of 10 demonstrates very good performance of the model the dependability of the model was additionally affirmed by rsr values of less than 0 53 table 5 in spite of the fact that the swat is suited for other assessment it overestimated the measured discharge by 4 3 and 1 during the calibration and validation respectively with the low magnitude values showing a good performance of the model the overestimation is portrayed by the negative pbias value the discharge hydrographs fig 4 also revealed inconsistencies in the peak timings similar calibration concerns were faced by abubakari et al 2018 aich et al 2016 and cornelissen et al 2013 when they used the swat model in the same climatic region this may be attributed to limitations in the quality of observed flow data lack of management practices in agricultural land use and management information and exclusion of dams reservoirs irrigation systems and ponds during the model setup due to absence of storage capacity data additionally overestimation of the streamflow may be due to baseflow overestimation which could result from excess aquifer contribution to groundwater recession flow in the prb a condition which is not dealt with in swat 3 3 precipitation bias correction the dm method moderately underestimated or overestimated the average monthly simulated rcm precipitation table 6 with the different scale and shape parameters table 7 the raw simulated data diverged from the measured precipitation in all rcm data in addition all the rcms with exception of remo crcm5 racmo22 t rca6 rca7and rca8 underestimated the raw simulation mean and the 90th percentile precipitation the dm method enhanced the raw simulation data and decreased the error in various component with various ranges the statistical indicators revealed uncertainty in various simulated raw rcm data a lesser correlation coefficient r and a greater rmse were revealed in entirely raw simulation furthermore the dm method showed a parallel and good r in monthly mean precipitation while reasonably similar and almost zero bias and rmse were identified for the bias corrected data the outcome showed that the dm method has a good capability in adjusting the raw simulation to reproduced the observed in various aspects 3 4 temperature bias correction the simulated raw temperature data overestimated the mean and 90th percentile of maximum and minimum temperature in all the rcms apart from cclm4 8 17 and racm022 t tables 8 and 9 the r and bias of the simulated raw data were moderately good in all the rcms simulations nevertheless a moderately higher rmse was identified in all the simulated raw maximum and minimum temperature this result is similar to the studies by geleta and gobosho 2018 in finchaa watershed ethiopia and zhang et al 2018 in northern part of lake erie basin in canada 3 5 selection of rcms using weighting and ranking fig 5 shows samples of taylor diagrams for only kumasi and takoradi three out of the seventeen climate stations to reduce the number of taylor diagrams for maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation data the observed data for 1970 2005 were compared with corresponding historical data obtained from individually rcms to evaluate the cc nrmse and nsd tables 10 12 show the weighting of the cc nrmse and nsd scaling the total weight and ranking of the first three best regional climate models for each gauge station the results revealed that the model that reproduced the observed data best varied from one station to station therefore using one rcm for climate impact assessment especially over a large area may affect the results this may be due to the fact that each station has different land surface vegetation dynamics sulphate aerosol non sulphate aerosol carbon concentration and atmospheric chemistry and the models resolve these features differently weighting and ranking method is needed when dealing with a large area where the climate gauge stations are wide apart the first three best rcms for each station were used as input data for the swat modeling simulation in this research 3 6 projected climate change assessment 3 6 1 projected temperature post bias correction reveals an increment in projected temperature under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios table 13 an increasing trend in the mean annual temperature change pattern was identified in b s and t across the three time periods under both scenarios the mean yearly increase in temperature varies from 2 9 to 7 03 under rcp4 5 and from 3 5 to 9 7 under rcp8 5 climate scenarios in general the average yearly temperature increases up to 4 6 under rcp4 5 and 6 5 c under rcp8 5 climate scenarios over the next 90 years according to the monthly assessment a consistent upsurge was identified in all the months for temperatures for the two climate scenarios under the three classified time periods where january appeared to be the warmest furthermore the projected increase in rcp8 5 temperature data under africa cordex climate scenarios in prb was higher than that of the rcp4 5 the projected changes in annual and monthly temperature time scales reveal possible warmer periods in the future with rcp8 5 appeared higher these findings are consistent with other studies carried out by jin et al 2018 in the volta river basin wu et al 2017 in jiangsu province morán tejeda et al 2015 in aragón catchment and yira et al 2017 in dano catchment where increases in temperature are expected in the ne md and ed further assessment indicated that the rcp8 5 scenario projected higher temperatures than rcp4 5 except in the case of ne of s sne the analysis depicted that with the same climate change scenario t projected the highest temperatures for both rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 3 6 2 projected precipitation the outcome of the post bias corrections of precipitation data revealed general increases in future average yearly precipitation in ne and md and decreases in the ed over prb fig 6 the increasing change in average yearly precipitation varies from 1 2 to 3 3 for rcp8 5 and to a higher range of 2 5 6 5 for rcp4 5 climate scenarios throughout the studied periods for the reduction rcp4 5 appeared to decrease more 2 4 7 compare to that of rcp8 5 1 1 to 0 84 the monthly precipitation assessment showed that increase in precipitation in rcp8 5 was lower than recorded in rcp4 5 and ranged between 0 and 17 the reduction in precipitation was higher in rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 in general the anticipated seasonal precipitation changes within 14 to 18 for rcp4 5 and 15 to 17 for rcp8 5 in the prb the future seasonal change in precipitation did not displayed any systematic reducing or increasing trend comparing to that of temperature which exhibited an increasing trend under both climate scenarios for the projected future periods these results are similar to researches done by abubakari et al 2018 in the white volta river basin wvrb in west africa al safi and sarukkalige 2017 in richmond river catchment in new south wales and tall et al 2017 in lake of guiers in senegal where climate models projected different trends of annual and monthly precipitation under different emission scenarios the monthly precipitation uncertainty of rcp8 5 was between 9 9 and 11 11 and 13 and 12 and 14 in ne md and ed respectively in general the anticipated seasonal precipitation changes within 14 to 18 for rcp4 5 and 15 to 17 for rcp8 5 these results are similar to the reported results by abubakari et al 2018 in the wvrb in west africa al safi and sarukkalige 2017 in richmond river catchment in new south wales and tall et al 2017 in lake of guiers in senegal where climate models are projecting different trends of annual and monthly precipitationl under different emission scenarios the uncertainties might be as a result of model construction there are many uncertainties linked to the construction of climate models and they can be grouped into initial conditions boundary conditions parameterizations and model structure construction uncertainty is introduced by the scientific selection of model design and development 3 7 future streamflow changes from climate impact the potential changes in the future streamflow under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the projection periods magnitude and sign are shown in fig 7 all the three groups of rcms best second best and third best projected substantial increases in streamflow for ne and md up to over 11 while a reduction of about 8 was projected in ed under rcp4 5 however rcp8 5 climate scenario revealed upsurge in streamflow that were identified for all 21 st century scenarios under b sne and ed of t with the highest increase of 5 projected for sne while the highest reduction of over 2 was projected in md of t tmd increasing streamflow values were highest under the rcp4 5 emission scenario and least under rcp8 5 the changes in the future monthly streamflow volumes under the different groups of climate models are shown in figs 8 and 9 in the rcp4 5 model projection may and june depicted the same streamflow change trend an increase in ne and md and a decrease in ed while july indicated an increasing trend in all three parts of the 21 st century the streamflow change trend in january is the same for both model groups a decreasing trend is identified in ne and md and an increasing in ed each modeling group projected variations in the streamflow volumes for instance ne of b projected a 5 5 increase in streamflow in february whereas sne and ne of t projected reductions of 3 7 and 8 3 respectively for the same month this is the same as in the month of august where b and t show increasing trends whilst s shows decreasing in all the century scenarios thus the dry flow month of august may be wet under b and t modeling groups and drier under s a shift in monthly maximum streamflow from june to july is projected by all the modeling groups for ed based on the results of the assessments the projected future monthly streamflow variations as a result of the rcp4 5 will be within 15 to 23 in the case of the rcp8 5 the bias corrected b climate model group projected decreases in flow for march while s and t groups projected increments for the same month the trend for july is similar to that of the scenario under rcp4 5 with the exception of tmd which depicted a reduction in streamflow at peak flow in june all the three groups of climate models showed an increase in flow up to 15 at all the parts of the 21 st century except ed of b and md of s which recorded reductions of 2 1 and 9 5 respectively based on the information from the rcp8 5 the projected future monthly streamflow changes may range between 24 and 24 3 8 seasonal analysis the overall projected streamflow changes for the wet and dry seasons show diverse patterns fig 10 from the rcp8 5 results the nes projected streamflow changes within 2 6 in wet season and 6 to 10 in the dry season for the mds projected streamflow variations stretched from 4 00 to 7 00 in the wet season and from 4 to 6 in the dry season variations for ed ranged from 3 to 8 in the wet season and 6 to 4 in the dry season the b modeling groups projected increasing flow volume in the wet season and decreasing flow volume in the dry season the s modeling group depicted opposite streamflow volume change with the exception of sne this might be due to the different seasonal projection capabilities of the modeling groups stemming from the uncertainties in the projected future climate by the models the magnitude and sign of the seasonal streamflow variations demonstrate noteworthy uncertainties among various modeling groups in the rcp4 5 scenario the patterns of the projected streamflow changes are the same in the wet season for all modeling groups streamflow volume increased for ne and md and decreased in ed in general the dry season streamflow in rcp4 5 depicted higher increasing trends compared to the trends in rcp8 5 the modeling groups b and s of rcp4 5 projected higher wet season streamflow changes than those in rcp8 5 generally the projected seasonal streamflow variations were not very intense for both the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios within 5 to 9 the results identified in this study have also been reported by studies undertaken by wu et al 2017 in the jiangsu province jin et al 2018 in the volta river basin and fentaw et al 2018 in ethiopian part of the tekeze basin 3 9 spatial variations of streamflow the annual spatial distribution of the future streamflow changes across the basin revealed differences in magnitude but similarity in sign for the rcp4 5 scenarios fig 11 the modeling groups projections indicate reduction in streamflow in the northern sub basins with the exception of tmd all the modeling groups projected increases in the southern western eastern and middle sub basins in the annual streamflow apart from south western parts of the s modeling group and south eastern part of tmd in the rcp8 5 scenarios the modeling chains projected opposite change in the northern and the upper south sub basins of the annual runoff when compared to the rcp4 5 fig 12 the northern sub basins revealed increase in the runoff while the upper south indicated a decrease increasing runoff projections at western eastern middle and the southernmost sub basins across the basin were similar to the rcp4 5 projections but different in magnitude the moderate upsurge in mean annual streamflow for both climate scenarios in all the future time epochs is attributed to projected increased in precipitation whereas the reduction in streamflow is as a result of high upsurge in projected temperature that prompts increment in evapotranspiration than upsurge in precipitation this is in agreement with the study carried out in the wvrb where the predictions of runoff differed through modeling chains in size and trend in various parts of the basin with the a1b emission scenario predicting increasing changes in southern and decreasing changes in northern while the b1 scenario projected the opposite abubakari et al 2018 with the a1b describing a future scenario whereby there is very rapid economic growth low population growth and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies the variation in the energy system is not as a result of one specific energy source on the presumption that similar enhancement rates connect with all energy supply and end use technologies whilst b1 presumes the same population growth but with less material intensity rapid variation in economic structures and largely concentrates on clean and efficient technologies it places more weight on economic social and environmental sustainability solutions devoid of extra climate initiatives the projected variations in runoff by rcps modeling groups in the 21 st century scenarios of the basin might have dire consequences on farmers crop yields and the operations of the ghana water company limited gwcl which is already faced with water availability and quality problems 3 10 uncertainty and limitation these include climate models emission scenarios bias correction and hydrological modelling generally the uncertainties connected to the climate model are more than those linked to the hydrological model or the bias correction arnell 2011 gosling et al 2011 li and jin 2017 upsurge in rcp8 5 temperature at monthly time scale through the best three models revealed uncertainty with ranges of 1 2 3 4 1 3 to 3 76 and 1 9 to 4 2 for ne md and ed respectively further assessment showed that the rcp4 5 projected higher temperatures than rcp8 5 in all the scenarios the uncertainties associated with the monthly precipitation at the various demarcations of the century were 8 04 12 9 1 to 11 and 10 6 to 25 in ne md and ed respectively unlike temperature variations precipitation variations indicate much uncertainty under different rcms and climate change scenarios the monthly streamflow changes from rcp8 5 fig 7 indicate substantially higher uncertainties when compared rcp4 5 changes fig 9 the rcp8 5 models showed monthly uncertainties varying from 7 8 to 16 9 07 18 and 8 5 21 whilst the rcp4 5 uncertainties ranged from 6 6 to 16 8 6 to 14 and 8 04 14 for ne md and ed respectively this research assumed that change in climate and anthropogenic distractions are unconnected in reality the alteration in climate and anthropogenic disturbances are connected and are not easily separable so in hydrological modeling atmosphere terrestrial interactions are typically very important li et al 2010 which could influence the streamflow s values and distributions thus further assessment of the impacts of such interactions on streamflow by means of a coupled high resolution climate watershed model is needed this will be the concentration of the forthcoming research 3 11 climate change impact on water resources planning the forecasted changes in prb streamflow between 2022 and 2099 may have a remarkable effect on 43 administrative districts and it is imperative that critical reactions to these variations be considered the projected climate variability such as the late onset of precipitation decrease in the span of the rainy period changes in the magnitude of precipitation and higher temperatures may affect farming schemes and gwcl operations the prb notably has low flood control engineering infrastructure hence future upturns in streamflow may upsurge flood challenges and the subsequent flooding may affect water quality it is therefore essential to plan for flood control during the raining seasons whilst drought should be mitigated during the dry season due to its impact on agricultural production the projected higher temperatures will have an adverse impact on the water environment and may lead to a rise in blue green algae populations and its attendant challenges shang et al 2010 xie et al 2016 the gwcl stations and farmers in the basin have already adopted a wide variety of climate change adaptation techniques to continuously supply water and maintain and increase farm yields kankam yeboah et al 2013 the existing agrarian policies or techniques must however shift towards ones which will empower farmers to better utilize the rains in the farming season farmers could be advised to plant fast maturing crops replace crops with a high water demand with crops adjusted to the new climate variability alter their planting period to match the new precipitation patterns and etc the gwcl must consider infrastructural enhancements public education to enhance awareness of climate risks and rigorous water supply management to alleviate water stress in the basin from the model simulated outcomes there are uncertainties over the sign of the change for both precipitation and streamflow in the study area overall the rcp4 5 projected a decrease in runoff in the northern parts of the basin with the eastern western middle and southern parts expected to increase in streamflow rcp8 5 projected an increase in streamflow in the northern eastern western middle and southernmost parts of the basin with a projected decrease in the upper south the proposed decrease in streamflow might have dire consequences for the operations of gwcl as well as the inhabitants of the basin whose main occupation is farming the negative impacts of the declining water accessibility can be lessened by applying water utilization efficiency and environmental integrity as well as stepping up effective planning management and sustenance of hydrology in these parts of the study area efficient utilization of water will certainly decrease demands from the three primary water use sectors domestic supply agriculture and industry keeping environmental integrity and establishing buffer zones for headwaters wetlands lakes and rivers would reduce the pollution and ruin of the basin s natural resources due to human factors awotwi et al 2018 the realization that mean streamflow in the prb will increase at some part of the basin in all the modeling groups calls for suitable investments in water planning and management techniques like construction of reservoirs that are efficient for harvesting the expected increase in surface runoff the gwcl has and will continue to increase its production due to urbanization and population growth to achieve this aim dams and reservoirs are being expanded or constructed there are also small reservoirs being constructed for irrigation purposes water resources commission 2012 with the view of storing more water in the wet season and releasing it during dry season regrettably the reservoirs and dams are being designed without factoring in climate change the designs should be enhanced by factoring in climate change impacts taking the altering climate into account it is essential to produce integrated water resource management policies that approach water storage through a variety of storage alternatives climate change adaptation procedures must be amalgamated with feasibility studies and development of projects for the study area kankam yeboah et al 2013 to be sustainable any ongoing or yet to be started project within the basin must count the possible influence of climate change on water resources and make needed provisions in planning design and financial arrangements 4 conclusion this study assessed the impacts of climate change on the prb s streamflow using bias corrected cordex africa medium emissions and high emissions climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the swat model was deployed to simulate basin streamflow patterns and the weighting scaling and ranking technique was engaged to select suitable rcm combinations in order to minimize uncertainties in the climate modeling the mce of the climate model for each climate station revealed that models reproducing the best of the observation dataset at each climate station are different thus using one model output will reduce the accuracy at some stations justifying the decision to generate and use modeling group combinations for the evaluation of the influence of climate change in the prb based on the results of the modeling groups there is consensus that the prb is expected to experience a rise in surface runoff by the end of the 21st century consequently it will be appropriate for stakeholders in agriculture in the basin and beyond to invest in cost effective water management techniques like constructing reservoirs to harvest more water during the wet season and gradually release it during the dry season agriculture policy and techniques must be geared towards those which will empower farmers to use precipitation profitably the projected change in climate in the basin supposes that any developmental projects within the basin should factor in the possible impacts of climate change on the future water resources and make room for planning design and budgeting though the swat modeling process in this study seemed quite fruitful there are limitations in the model being not all the hydrological components like deep aquifer recharge or soil moisture deep aquifer recharge could be specifically calibrated due to lack of data also the full capacities of the hydrological model cannot be obtained in the light of the absence of locational hydrological and farming management information although outcomes of this research will offer an essential foundation for stakeholders planning for the future water resources in the prb there were three main uncertainties associated with the study the static and dynamics swat input data the swat model and the climate model this implies that additional research is needed to enhance the results with respect to the above uncertainties by using multiple models and training personnel on the right way to collect prepare and store data owing to prevailing heterogeneous conditions in river basins globally this study can be used as a guideline for other related research aimed at understanding the change and trends in water resources to advice efficient planning and management for

model with bias corrected climate data from regional climate models rcms for the near 21 st century 2010 2039 the mid 21 st century 2040 2069 and the end of the 21 st century 2070 2099 under two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 weighting scaling and ranking techniques were applied to the data from each of the seventeen climate stations to select the climate models that best reproduced the observation dataset new hydrological insights for the region the results from the calibration and validation r2 and nse 0 75 and pbias within 10 revealed good simulation of the prb hydrology from the swat model annually streamflow in the near and the mid 21st century is projected to increase within 4 and 12 while a reduction was projected at the end of the 21 st century with the rcp4 5 emission scenario the simulation results from the rcp8 5 scenario showed increase streamflow throughout the 21 st century applying the best performing models monthly streamflow variations varied between 15 and 23 for rcp4 5 and 24 to 24 for rcp8 5 generally increasing streamflow was highest in the rcp4 5 emission scenario in view of the model outcomes the prb is expected to experience upsurge in streamflow by the near and the mid of the 21 st century this would require proper planning by applying cost effective adaptative water management strategies to provide for the probable influence of climate change on the future water resources of the basin keywords weighting scaling and ranking techniques climate impact hydrological model streamflow pra river basin 1 introduction increasing temperature based on rcms data portrays that hydrological cycle might be altered as a result of increase in the water holding capacity of the atmosphere this will result in an upsurge of the quantity of renewable fresh water resources he et al 2017 hu and gao 2019 piani et al 2010 according to piani et al 2010 an increase in temperature for some regions may lead to reduction in precipitation linked to intensification in the seasonal cycle as well as frequency of extreme events this result suggests the existence of high uncertainties in the projected effects of increasing temperatures on the hydrology for some regions salack et al 2015 the reliability of rcms over west africa depends on their capability to reproduce observed climate data accurate modeling of many climate parameters however remains a challenging task for one particular rcm kabuya et al 2020 szabó takács et al 2019 shrestha et al 2017 schilling et al 2012 since each rcm simulates the individual climate parameter differently hydrological components response to climate change signal therefore appears unclear for west africa moreover most future climate impact assessment studies have been conducted with climate data from each climatic gauge stations derived from only one climate model output since the input components for climate models like land surface vegetation dynamics atmosphere sulphate and non sulphate aerosols sea and oceans vary at each climate gauge station using one output model may not be the best to reproduce the observed climate dataset at each climate gauge station for large basins this study therefore employed multi criteria evaluation mce to assess all the cordex africa model data at each climate gauge station using the multi criteria evaluation mce the best three models best b second best s and third best t for each gauge station were used to form three groups of scenarios for hydrological impact assessment in the prb the prb consists of rivers streams and forest areas which route large volumes of water it controls carbon and nutrient biogeochemistry and discharge carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere the basin supports various ecosystems and socio economic activities apart from the normal anthropogenic global warming activities such as urban expansions industrialization and expansion in agriculture at the expense of forest areas the prb is experiencing uncontrolled rapid illegal and small scale mining activities which are other sources of anthropogenic global warming in recent times the basin has encountered seasonal inadequacy in water availability making it one of the fastest water declining river basins globally awotwi et al 2018 water resources commission 2012 kusimi et al 2014 bessah et al 2019 thus there is a need to present accurate projections about the effect of future climate change on hydrological components within the prb for planning and managing the natural water resources for sustainable development though previous researches have evaluated the effects of projected climate change on water resources in west africa tall et al 2017 abubakari et al 2018 jin et al 2018 mbaye et al 2016 all relied on simulated hydrological components based on climate data simulated by a single rcm for the entire study areas this study broadly aims at estimating the future climate change influence on streamflow of the prb in ghana west africa by applying a wider dataset that will contribute to a meaningful knowledge for the planning and managing water resources in the region with sustainable developmental plans to accomplish this aim 1 all the co ordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa rcms were evaluated at each climate station using mce to select the rcms which best reproduce the observed data 2 assess the climate change signal for the near 21 st century mid 21st century and the end of the 21 st century while comparing it to the base period 1971 2005 and 3 evaluate the effects of climate change on the streamflow in the prb for the rest of the 21 st century using swat hydrologic model in west africa the swat model has been effectively used in hydrological assessments jin et al 2018 awotwi et al 2015b kankam yeboah et al 2013 mahé 2009 and therefore has the capability to simulate reliable hydrological components the outcomes obtained from this research are likely to give more understanding into the future water availability and to offer local water management agencies and policy makers with the quantifiable data for the suitable design management and the sustainability of water resources by factoring in climate adaptation policies to minimize vulnerability and guarantee water security for present and future generations design of adaptation policies to solve the possible effects of climate change on water resource structures is a substantial challenge for stakeholders in the water resources industry rashid et al 2019 dube and nhamo 2019 hirpa et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 noi and nitivattananon 2015 hassanzadeh et al 2016 according to the fifth assessments report of the ipcc 2014 the west african sub region shows little adaptive capability though it is extremely exposed to climate change projections for the 21 st century show austere effects of climate change on hydrology in the sub region these include an upsurge in the risk of water stress and flood yomo et al 2019 serdeczny et al 2017 acharya and prakash 2019 and vital alterations in river discharge khandekar et al 2019 sassi et al 2019 aich et al 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the prb fig 1 is located in the south central part of ghana and drains about 23 256 4 km2 the main pra river takes its source from the uplands of the kwahu plateau in the eastern region and flows for about 240 km before joining the atlantic ocean near shama in the western region after travelling through four administrative regions eastern ashanti western and central water resources commission 2012 with annual discharge of 214m3 s akrasi and ansa asare 2008 it consists of four major tributaries birim offin anum and oda rivers and densest network of streams besides the river network it contains the only notable natural freshwater lake in ghana lake bosomtwe the prb is one of the most widely and severely altered river basins in ghana due to expansion in settlement mining agriculture and logging as a result of its high mineral deposits and economic tree species and its favorable farming environment awotwi et al 2018 the vegetative cover of the basin had and still go through a rapid rate of deforestation attributable to these anthropogenic activities the basin experiences a sub equatorial climate with double rainy seasons may july as the major season and september november as the minor season awotwi et al 2017 spatially precipitation pattern increases from the north to south of the prb with a yearly mean precipitation of 1550 mm the mean minimum and maximum air temperatures are 23 c and 33 c respectively air temperature decreases towards the southern part of the prb awotwi et al 2017 the southern section of the basin is relatively flat while the mid to northern sections consist of few peaks with broad river valleys the prb further consists of extensive agricultural lands uncontrolled mining activities urban and rural settlement and industries which use large volumes of water these factors make evaluating the effect of future climate change on the local hydrology in the study area exceedingly important to help outline effective efficient and sustainable water resources management programs to guarantee availability of water for present and future generations 2 2 swat model input components the swat model needs topographic soil types and land use static data and hydro meteorological data dynamic data fig 2 to setup the model 2 2 1 digital elevation model the swat model needs topographic information for delineation of watershed and depicting of drainage trends of the land surface the dem 1 1000 000 at 30 m resolution obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm was corrected for sinks 2 2 2 land use land cover types the prb land use map needed by the hydrological model for hrus generation was obtained from the hybrid classification of 2016 enhanced thematic mapper etm landsat image lulc information is vital for water resources analysis and especially for modeling hydrological processes fig 3 a 2 2 3 soil types the soil types map fig 3b and its properties were obtained from the council for scientific and industrial research ghana soil database and the united nation s food and agriculture fao soil database in all six soil types were identified in the study area with acrisols covering over 75 of the prb the rest of the soil types are luvisols lixisols fluvisols leptosols and reclaimed soil 2 2 4 observed climate data daily time series precipitation and air temperatures minimum and maximum data for a period of 40 years 1970 2010 were obtained from the ghana meteorological agency gmet at seventeen climatic stations situated within and close to the basin but there were missing values in the data on average less than 7 for both precipitation and temperature the correlation weighting interpolated technique was used to estimate the missing values of climate data from some meteorological stations 2 3 homogeneity analysis of precipitation data as a result of changes in observational and measurement procedures environment landscapes and edifices and relocation of climate stations climate datasets could show inhomogeneity therefore homogenization analysis on climate data is a significant procedure to identify the changeability in the data this study used the standard normal homogeneity test snht proposed by alexandersson 1986 to assess the homogeneity per the null hypothesis the yearly values pi of the testing variables p are independent and evenly distributed therefore the data is termed homogeneous alternative hypothesis test presume that the data involves discontinuity in the mean and termed inhomogeneous the statistic s p which matches the average of the first p years to n p years is evaluated by 1 s p p z 1 n p z 2 p 1 2 3 4 n where 2 z 1 1 p i 1 n p i p σ a n d z 2 1 n p i p 1 n p i p σ p and σ average and the standard deviation respectively the year p is said to consist of break if the value of s is maximum to reject null hypothesis the test statistic 3 s 0 max 1 p n s p is greater than the critical value which is based on the sample size the method proposed by wijngaard et al 2003 was used to evaluate the homogeneity of the precipitation data at each climate station and using yearly average and yearly maximum as testing variables the yearly mean and maximum precipitation of each climate station were examined for homogeneity utilizing a critical value of 6 95 proposed by wijngaard et al 2003 2 4 model calibration and validation of flow discharge some parameters used by hydrological models cannot be measured directly in the field these parameters need to be adjusted to enhance the concurrence between observed and simulated values for this work the calibration and validation were done using a 31 year period daily observed discharge data 1 st january 1980 31st december 2010 at the daboase gauge station the outlet of the prb obtained from ghana hydrological service however there were missing values in the observed data which were less than 4 of the observed data three years data 1st january 1980 31st december 1982 were used to warm up the model while that of 1st january 1983 31st december 1998 and 1st january 1999 31st december 2010 were used for calibration and validation respectively employing a manual calibration method the model parameters were adjusted until the modeled discharge was within the statistically suitable model performance scope the gaps in the data were filled using the inverse distance weighting method with respect to the dunkwa on offin and twifo praso gauging stations in this study manual calibration which involves a trial and error method was adopted it was carried out on parameters that were most sensitive during sensitivity analysis abubakari et al 2018 the sensitivity analysis of the study was done with reference to the calibration periods on the optimization process that replicates the sensitivity of the 21 swat input parameters 1500 numbers of iterations were performed in gaining the most sensitive parameters after model calibration 12 years discharge data from the daboase station 1st january 1999 31st december 2010 was used for model validation the reliability of the simulation was assessed statistically by four indices nash sutcliff efficiency nse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 chu and shirmohammadi 2004 gupta et al 1999 and santhi et al 2011 respectively the assessment of the performance of the hydrological model is based on the statistical indicators nse pbias and rsr proposed by moriasi et al 2007 2 5 future climate change cc scenarios the ipcc representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were utilized as the principal tools for future climate change assessment because rcp8 5 is considered the strongest climate signal with the greatest atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in the late 21 st century while rcp4 5 presumes that emissions of greenhouse gases will soon become constant and then drop after a few decades van vuuren et al 2011 future precipitation and temperature data were obtained from outputs of nine gcms forcing six rcms table 1 from the cordex africa initiative the objective of cordex africa is to provide high resolution climate data for africa historical simulated data 1971 2005 was utilized as the reference epoch for this study the impending climate is characterized for three timeline scenarios 2010 2039 representing near 21st century ne 2040 2069 signifying mid 21st century md and 2070 2099 indicating the end of the 21st century ed 2 6 bias correction despite the fact that the models have been enhanced over time they still contain bias and is a source of worry in climate research uncorrected output from climate models makes it unreliable for effective hydrological studies therefore the usage of bias correction methods on the downloaded simulated climate data to improve the exactness of the modeled hydrological components to overcome this distribution mapping dm bias correcting method of cmhyd model rathjens et al 2016 was used to correct the bias this component has been extensively use in bias correction for climate change assessment studies schmidli et al 2006 olsson et al 2015 mbaye et al 2016 tschoke et al 2017 the rationale behind this method is to fit the parameters of transfer functions of climate modeled data to that of the measured data gamma and gaussian distributions transfer functions are used on precipitation and temperature respectively with the precipitation random precipitation intensity will first of all be definite and then employed to establish the cumulative probability of modeled precipitation after that centered on the cumulative probability the corrected precipitation value is chosen while for temperature the cumulative probability of modeled temperature data may well be established subsequently based on the probability the corrected temperature value can be chosen according to teutschbein and seibert 2012 this method of bias correction yields a very good result 2 7 weighting and ranking of climate models around the globe there are over thirty research groups that have established their own climate models though the foundation framework of these models is similar they all vary in their details in any instance the models must depict the physical collaborations between the atmosphere the oceans land surfaces and sea ice with reference to a multitude of processes functioning on various space and time scales climate model developers have different opinions about which physical components to emphasize thus at the same time different climate models produce different results at a location to produce reliable climate impact results this study compared all the cordex africa models output data with the observed data at each climate station this was achieved by first generating a taylor diagram for all the cordex africa models data for each climate station wet and dry season taylor diagrams for minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation the taylor diagram offers a statistical summary of how well the modeled patterns reproduce the observed patterns in terms of mean square error rmse correlation coefficient cc and normalized standardized deviation nsd it provides a diagram as a series of points on a polar plot consequently all these three statistical factors should be considered at the same time with equal weight in selecting the best model equal weights of 1 10 corresponding to worst to best reproduction of the observed climate dataset were placed on rmse cc and nsd of each climate model at each climatic gauge station using eqs 6 and 7 for precipitation the data was scaled down with 0 7 for wet season and 0 3 for dry season while temperature maximum and minimum were scaled by 0 5 for both wet and dry season fig 2 after which the sum of the weights were taken to institute the ranking of the climate models it is appropriate to arrange them based on the reducing value of their closeness coefficient of summation weights though it was tedious time consuming and expensive procedure it produces highly accurate data for the impact assessment then bias correction was applied to the best three models for each station before they were used to force the hydrological model swat 6 w t r m s e n s d 10 10 r m s e t d n s d t d r m s e t o n s d t o 7 w t

the total length of rmse and nsd respectively with reference to obs on the taylor diagram and w t c c is the weighted cc 2 8 uncertainty assessment it would be ideal to have data free from uncertainties but this is not possible to some extent each single data has some form of uncertainties therefore there are uncertainties related to this study according to walker et al 2003 uncertainty is any departure from complete deterministic knowledge of the relevant system therefore the uncertainty associated with this study was evaluated based on 8 d i f f e r e n c e e s b e t w e e n o b s e r v e d a n d b e s t s e c o n d b e s t t h i r d b e s t m o d e l o b s e r v e d 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation homogeneity from table 2 the entire seventeen stations reveled homogeneity in their precipitation under the testing variable of annual mean as the null hypothesis under the snht is not rejected at 0 05 level of significance whiles only one climate station precipitation data out of the seventeen stations portrayed homogeneity under the yearly maximum testing variable although inhomogeneous station was detected the outcomes are suitable since there is no much variation hence the stations can be used for further assessment 3 2 calibration and validation of swat the fourteen most sensitive parameters out of 21 obtained from the sensitivity analysis are shown in table 3 the scs runoff curve number cn2 was found to be the most sensitive parameters for the prb the final adjusted final values during calibration are shown in table 4 these parameters are substantially linked to surface runoff the comparisons of measured and simulated hydrographs for the calibration and validation epochs are shown in fig 4 the overestimation and underestimation of the simulated discharge might be due to the mistakes in measuring the input data as well as errors associated with the swat model the underestimation of the low flows may be as a result of more than one aquifer contributing to baseflow which is not dealt with in the swat model the graphs revealed a good agreement between measured and simulated streamflow values with r2 being 0 75 for both calibration and validation periods uncovering a decent agreement between the observed and the modeled discharge and least error variance between the two data sets moriasi et al 2007 moreover nse values of 0 75 and pbias values inside the scope of 10 demonstrates very good performance of the model the dependability of the model was additionally affirmed by rsr values of less than 0 53 table 5 in spite of the fact that the swat is suited for other assessment it overestimated the measured discharge by 4 3 and 1 during the calibration and validation respectively with the low magnitude values showing a good performance of the model the overestimation is portrayed by the negative pbias value the discharge hydrographs fig 4 also revealed inconsistencies in the peak timings similar calibration concerns were faced by abubakari et al 2018 aich et al 2016 and cornelissen et al 2013 when they used the swat model in the same climatic region this may be attributed to limitations in the quality of observed flow data lack of management practices in agricultural land use and management information and exclusion of dams reservoirs irrigation systems and ponds during the model setup due to absence of storage capacity data additionally overestimation of the streamflow may be due to baseflow overestimation which could result from excess aquifer contribution to groundwater recession flow in the prb a condition which is not dealt with in swat 3 3 precipitation bias correction the dm method moderately underestimated or overestimated the average monthly simulated rcm precipitation table 6 with the different scale and shape parameters table 7 the raw simulated data diverged from the measured precipitation in all rcm data in addition all the rcms with exception of remo crcm5 racmo22 t rca6 rca7and rca8 underestimated the raw simulation mean and the 90th percentile precipitation the dm method enhanced the raw simulation data and decreased the error in various component with various ranges the statistical indicators revealed uncertainty in various simulated raw rcm data a lesser correlation coefficient r and a greater rmse were revealed in entirely raw simulation furthermore the dm method showed a parallel and good r in monthly mean precipitation while reasonably similar and almost zero bias and rmse were identified for the bias corrected data the outcome showed that the dm method has a good capability in adjusting the raw simulation to reproduced the observed in various aspects 3 4 temperature bias correction the simulated raw temperature data overestimated the mean and 90th percentile of maximum and minimum temperature in all the rcms apart from cclm4 8 17 and racm022 t tables 8 and 9 the r and bias of the simulated raw data were moderately good in all the rcms simulations nevertheless a moderately higher rmse was identified in all the simulated raw maximum and minimum temperature this result is similar to the studies by geleta and gobosho 2018 in finchaa watershed ethiopia and zhang et al 2018 in northern part of lake erie basin in canada 3 5 selection of rcms using weighting and ranking fig 5 shows samples of taylor diagrams for only kumasi and takoradi three out of the seventeen climate stations to reduce the number of taylor diagrams for maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation data the observed data for 1970 2005 were compared with corresponding historical data obtained from individually rcms to evaluate the cc nrmse and nsd tables 10 12 show the weighting of the cc nrmse and nsd scaling the total weight and ranking of the first three best regional climate models for each gauge station the results revealed that the model that reproduced the observed data best varied from one station to station therefore using one rcm for climate impact assessment especially over a large area may affect the results this may be due to the fact that each station has different land surface vegetation dynamics sulphate aerosol non sulphate aerosol carbon concentration and atmospheric chemistry and the models resolve these features differently weighting and ranking method is needed when dealing with a large area where the climate gauge stations are wide apart the first three best rcms for each station were used as input data for the swat modeling simulation in this research 3 6 projected climate change assessment 3 6 1 projected temperature post bias correction reveals an increment in projected temperature under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios table 13 an increasing trend in the mean annual temperature change pattern was identified in b s and t across the three time periods under both scenarios the mean yearly increase in temperature varies from 2 9 to 7 03 under rcp4 5 and from 3 5 to 9 7 under rcp8 5 climate scenarios in general the average yearly temperature increases up to 4 6 under rcp4 5 and 6 5 c under rcp8 5 climate scenarios over the next 90 years according to the monthly assessment a consistent upsurge was identified in all the months for temperatures for the two climate scenarios under the three classified time periods where january appeared to be the warmest furthermore the projected increase in rcp8 5 temperature data under africa cordex climate scenarios in prb was higher than that of the rcp4 5 the projected changes in annual and monthly temperature time scales reveal possible warmer periods in the future with rcp8 5 appeared higher these findings are consistent with other studies carried out by jin et al 2018 in the volta river basin wu et al 2017 in jiangsu province morán tejeda et al 2015 in aragón catchment and yira et al 2017 in dano catchment where increases in temperature are expected in the ne md and ed further assessment indicated that the rcp8 5 scenario projected higher temperatures than rcp4 5 except in the case of ne of s sne the analysis depicted that with the same climate change scenario t projected the highest temperatures for both rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 3 6 2 projected precipitation the outcome of the post bias corrections of precipitation data revealed general increases in future average yearly precipitation in ne and md and decreases in the ed over prb fig 6 the increasing change in average yearly precipitation varies from 1 2 to 3 3 for rcp8 5 and to a higher range of 2 5 6 5 for rcp4 5 climate scenarios throughout the studied periods for the reduction rcp4 5 appeared to decrease more 2 4 7 compare to that of rcp8 5 1 1 to 0 84 the monthly precipitation assessment showed that increase in precipitation in rcp8 5 was lower than recorded in rcp4 5 and ranged between 0 and 17 the reduction in precipitation was higher in rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 in general the anticipated seasonal precipitation changes within 14 to 18 for rcp4 5 and 15 to 17 for rcp8 5 in the prb the future seasonal change in precipitation did not displayed any systematic reducing or increasing trend comparing to that of temperature which exhibited an increasing trend under both climate scenarios for the projected future periods these results are similar to researches done by abubakari et al 2018 in the white volta river basin wvrb in west africa al safi and sarukkalige 2017 in richmond river catchment in new south wales and tall et al 2017 in lake of guiers in senegal where climate models projected different trends of annual and monthly precipitation under different emission scenarios the monthly precipitation uncertainty of rcp8 5 was between 9 9 and 11 11 and 13 and 12 and 14 in ne md and ed respectively in general the anticipated seasonal precipitation changes within 14 to 18 for rcp4 5 and 15 to 17 for rcp8 5 these results are similar to the reported results by abubakari et al 2018 in the wvrb in west africa al safi and sarukkalige 2017 in richmond river catchment in new south wales and tall et al 2017 in lake of guiers in senegal where climate models are projecting different trends of annual and monthly precipitationl under different emission scenarios the uncertainties might be as a result of model construction there are many uncertainties linked to the construction of climate models and they can be grouped into initial conditions boundary conditions parameterizations and model structure construction uncertainty is introduced by the scientific selection of model design and development 3 7 future streamflow changes from climate impact the potential changes in the future streamflow under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the projection periods magnitude and sign are shown in fig 7 all the three groups of rcms best second best and third best projected substantial increases in streamflow for ne and md up to over 11 while a reduction of about 8 was projected in ed under rcp4 5 however rcp8 5 climate scenario revealed upsurge in streamflow that were identified for all 21 st century scenarios under b sne and ed of t with the highest increase of 5 projected for sne while the highest reduction of over 2 was projected in md of t tmd increasing streamflow values were highest under the rcp4 5 emission scenario and least under rcp8 5 the changes in the future monthly streamflow volumes under the different groups of climate models are shown in figs 8 and 9 in the rcp4 5 model projection may and june depicted the same streamflow change trend an increase in ne and md and a decrease in ed while july indicated an increasing trend in all three parts of the 21 st century the streamflow change trend in january is the same for both model groups a decreasing trend is identified in ne and md and an increasing in ed each modeling group projected variations in the streamflow volumes for instance ne of b projected a 5 5 increase in streamflow in february whereas sne and ne of t projected reductions of 3 7 and 8 3 respectively for the same month this is the same as in the month of august where b and t show increasing trends whilst s shows decreasing in all the century scenarios thus the dry flow month of august may be wet under b and t modeling groups and drier under s a shift in monthly maximum streamflow from june to july is projected by all the modeling groups for ed based on the results of the assessments the projected future monthly streamflow variations as a result of the rcp4 5 will be within 15 to 23 in the case of the rcp8 5 the bias corrected b climate model group projected decreases in flow for march while s and t groups projected increments for the same month the trend for july is similar to that of the scenario under rcp4 5 with the exception of tmd which depicted a reduction in streamflow at peak flow in june all the three groups of climate models showed an increase in flow up to 15 at all the parts of the 21 st century except ed of b and md of s which recorded reductions of 2 1 and 9 5 respectively based on the information from the rcp8 5 the projected future monthly streamflow changes may range between 24 and 24 3 8 seasonal analysis the overall projected streamflow changes for the wet and dry seasons show diverse patterns fig 10 from the rcp8 5 results the nes projected streamflow changes within 2 6 in wet season and 6 to 10 in the dry season for the mds projected streamflow variations stretched from 4 00 to 7 00 in the wet season and from 4 to 6 in the dry season variations for ed ranged from 3 to 8 in the wet season and 6 to 4 in the dry season the b modeling groups projected increasing flow volume in the wet season and decreasing flow volume in the dry season the s modeling group depicted opposite streamflow volume change with the exception of sne this might be due to the different seasonal projection capabilities of the modeling groups stemming from the uncertainties in the projected future climate by the models the magnitude and sign of the seasonal streamflow variations demonstrate noteworthy uncertainties among various modeling groups in the rcp4 5 scenario the patterns of the projected streamflow changes are the same in the wet season for all modeling groups streamflow volume increased for ne and md and decreased in ed in general the dry season streamflow in rcp4 5 depicted higher increasing trends compared to the trends in rcp8 5 the modeling groups b and s of rcp4 5 projected higher wet season streamflow changes than those in rcp8 5 generally the projected seasonal streamflow variations were not very intense for both the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios within 5 to 9 the results identified in this study have also been reported by studies undertaken by wu et al 2017 in the jiangsu province jin et al 2018 in the volta river basin and fentaw et al 2018 in ethiopian part of the tekeze basin 3 9 spatial variations of streamflow the annual spatial distribution of the future streamflow changes across the basin revealed differences in magnitude but similarity in sign for the rcp4 5 scenarios fig 11 the modeling groups projections indicate reduction in streamflow in the northern sub basins with the exception of tmd all the modeling groups projected increases in the southern western eastern and middle sub basins in the annual streamflow apart from south western parts of the s modeling group and south eastern part of tmd in the rcp8 5 scenarios the modeling chains projected opposite change in the northern and the upper south sub basins of the annual runoff when compared to the rcp4 5 fig 12 the northern sub basins revealed increase in the runoff while the upper south indicated a decrease increasing runoff projections at western eastern middle and the southernmost sub basins across the basin were similar to the rcp4 5 projections but different in magnitude the moderate upsurge in mean annual streamflow for both climate scenarios in all the future time epochs is attributed to projected increased in precipitation whereas the reduction in streamflow is as a result of high upsurge in projected temperature that prompts increment in evapotranspiration than upsurge in precipitation this is in agreement with the study carried out in the wvrb where the predictions of runoff differed through modeling chains in size and trend in various parts of the basin with the a1b emission scenario predicting increasing changes in southern and decreasing changes in northern while the b1 scenario projected the opposite abubakari et al 2018 with the a1b describing a future scenario whereby there is very rapid economic growth low population growth and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies the variation in the energy system is not as a result of one specific energy source on the presumption that similar enhancement rates connect with all energy supply and end use technologies whilst b1 presumes the same population growth but with less material intensity rapid variation in economic structures and largely concentrates on clean and efficient technologies it places more weight on economic social and environmental sustainability solutions devoid of extra climate initiatives the projected variations in runoff by rcps modeling groups in the 21 st century scenarios of the basin might have dire consequences on farmers crop yields and the operations of the ghana water company limited gwcl which is already faced with water availability and quality problems 3 10 uncertainty and limitation these include climate models emission scenarios bias correction and hydrological modelling generally the uncertainties connected to the climate model are more than those linked to the hydrological model or the bias correction arnell 2011 gosling et al 2011 li and jin 2017 upsurge in rcp8 5 temperature at monthly time scale through the best three models revealed uncertainty with ranges of 1 2 3 4 1 3 to 3 76 and 1 9 to 4 2 for ne md and ed respectively further assessment showed that the rcp4 5 projected higher temperatures than rcp8 5 in all the scenarios the uncertainties associated with the monthly precipitation at the various demarcations of the century were 8 04 12 9 1 to 11 and 10 6 to 25 in ne md and ed respectively unlike temperature variations precipitation variations indicate much uncertainty under different rcms and climate change scenarios the monthly streamflow changes from rcp8 5 fig 7 indicate substantially higher uncertainties when compared rcp4 5 changes fig 9 the rcp8 5 models showed monthly uncertainties varying from 7 8 to 16 9 07 18 and 8 5 21 whilst the rcp4 5 uncertainties ranged from 6 6 to 16 8 6 to 14 and 8 04 14 for ne md and ed respectively this research assumed that change in climate and anthropogenic distractions are unconnected in reality the alteration in climate and anthropogenic disturbances are connected and are not easily separable so in hydrological modeling atmosphere terrestrial interactions are typically very important li et al 2010 which could influence the streamflow s values and distributions thus further assessment of the impacts of such interactions on streamflow by means of a coupled high resolution climate watershed model is needed this will be the concentration of the forthcoming research 3 11 climate change impact on water resources planning the forecasted changes in prb streamflow between 2022 and 2099 may have a remarkable effect on 43 administrative districts and it is imperative that critical reactions to these variations be considered the projected climate variability such as the late onset of precipitation decrease in the span of the rainy period changes in the magnitude of precipitation and higher temperatures may affect farming schemes and gwcl operations the prb notably has low flood control engineering infrastructure hence future upturns in streamflow may upsurge flood challenges and the subsequent flooding may affect water quality it is therefore essential to plan for flood control during the raining seasons whilst drought should be mitigated during the dry season due to its impact on agricultural production the projected higher temperatures will have an adverse impact on the water environment and may lead to a rise in blue green algae populations and its attendant challenges shang et al 2010 xie et al 2016 the gwcl stations and farmers in the basin have already adopted a wide variety of climate change adaptation techniques to continuously supply water and maintain and increase farm yields kankam yeboah et al 2013 the existing agrarian policies or techniques must however shift towards ones which will empower farmers to better utilize the rains in the farming season farmers could be advised to plant fast maturing crops replace crops with a high water demand with crops adjusted to the new climate variability alter their planting period to match the new precipitation patterns and etc the gwcl must consider infrastructural enhancements public education to enhance awareness of climate risks and rigorous water supply management to alleviate water stress in the basin from the model simulated outcomes there are uncertainties over the sign of the change for both precipitation and streamflow in the study area overall the rcp4 5 projected a decrease in runoff in the northern parts of the basin with the eastern western middle and southern parts expected to increase in streamflow rcp8 5 projected an increase in streamflow in the northern eastern western middle and southernmost parts of the basin with a projected decrease in the upper south the proposed decrease in streamflow might have dire consequences for the operations of gwcl as well as the inhabitants of the basin whose main occupation is farming the negative impacts of the declining water accessibility can be lessened by applying water utilization efficiency and environmental integrity as well as stepping up effective planning management and sustenance of hydrology in these parts of the study area efficient utilization of water will certainly decrease demands from the three primary water use sectors domestic supply agriculture and industry keeping environmental integrity and establishing buffer zones for headwaters wetlands lakes and rivers would reduce the pollution and ruin of the basin s natural resources due to human factors awotwi et al 2018 the realization that mean streamflow in the prb will increase at some part of the basin in all the modeling groups calls for suitable investments in water planning and management techniques like construction of reservoirs that are efficient for harvesting the expected increase in surface runoff the gwcl has and will continue to increase its production due to urbanization and population growth to achieve this aim dams and reservoirs are being expanded or constructed there are also small reservoirs being constructed for irrigation purposes water resources commission 2012 with the view of storing more water in the wet season and releasing it during dry season regrettably the reservoirs and dams are being designed without factoring in climate change the designs should be enhanced by factoring in climate change impacts taking the altering climate into account it is essential to produce integrated water resource management policies that approach water storage through a variety of storage alternatives climate change adaptation procedures must be amalgamated with feasibility studies and development of projects for the study area kankam yeboah et al 2013 to be sustainable any ongoing or yet to be started project within the basin must count the possible influence of climate change on water resources and make needed provisions in planning design and financial arrangements 4 conclusion this study assessed the impacts of climate change on the prb s streamflow using bias corrected cordex africa medium emissions and high emissions climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the swat model was deployed to simulate basin streamflow patterns and the weighting scaling and ranking technique was engaged to select suitable rcm combinations in order to minimize uncertainties in the climate modeling the mce of the climate model for each climate station revealed that models reproducing the best of the observation dataset at each climate station are different thus using one model output will reduce the accuracy at some stations justifying the decision to generate and use modeling group combinations for the evaluation of the influence of climate change in the prb based on the results of the modeling groups there is consensus that the prb is expected to experience a rise in surface runoff by the end of the 21st century consequently it will be appropriate for stakeholders in agriculture in the basin and beyond to invest in cost effective water management techniques like constructing reservoirs to harvest more water during the wet season and gradually release it during the dry season agriculture policy and techniques must be geared towards those which will empower farmers to use precipitation profitably the projected change in climate in the basin supposes that any developmental projects within the basin should factor in the possible impacts of climate change on the future water resources and make room for planning design and budgeting though the swat modeling process in this study seemed quite fruitful there are limitations in the model being not all the hydrological components like deep aquifer recharge or soil moisture deep aquifer recharge could be specifically calibrated due to lack of data also the full capacities of the hydrological model cannot be obtained in the light of the absence of locational hydrological and farming management information although outcomes of this research will offer an essential foundation for stakeholders planning for the future water resources in the prb there were three main uncertainties associated with the study the static and dynamics swat input data the swat model and the climate model this implies that additional research is needed to enhance the results with respect to the above uncertainties by using multiple models and training personnel on the right way to collect prepare and store data owing to prevailing heterogeneous conditions in river basins globally this study can be used as a guideline for other related research aimed at understanding the change and trends in water resources to advice efficient planning and management for sustaining natural resources in relation to climate change authors contributions alfred awotwi conceptualization methodology software validation investigation formal analysis resources data curation

8273,study region in this study we use stable isotopes of water to quantify the flow pathways delivering water to the tributaries mainstem river and groundwater basin underlying urban san diego information about sources of stormflow and recharge are necessary to maintain the health of waterways and aquifers but studies of these processes are scarce in urban semi arid regions study focus isotopic methods have been used in experimental or natural watersheds but also have potential to quantify urban water cycling behaviour and water sources we sampled baseflow precipitation and hourly stormflow from eight events with a range of antecedent conditions and used end member mixing analysis to determine stormflow and groundwater sources new hydrological insights for the region our results show that hydrologic connectivity controls stormflow sources after a dry summer and early in storm events connectivity of pre event water with the channel is low so only new precipitation reaches the river in wetter conditions connectivity is higher and pre event surface water mixes with infiltration origin groundwater deeper groundwater composition mimics stormflow a mix of stagnated river water and infiltration origin water the close connection between streamflow and groundwater implies that improving groundwater quality requires improvements to surface water quality average uncertainty in source fractions was 8 0 suggesting that despite complex water pathways in urban semi arid environments isotopic sampling is valuable for quantifying water sources keywords stable isotopes end member mixing analysis urban semi arid aquifer watershed 1 introduction most people live in urban environments with a projected 70 of the world population living in urbanized areas by the year 2050 united nations 2007 to meet growing water demand urban areas have steadily increased their reliance on groundwater globally groundwater use accounts for about one third of all freshwater consumption gleick 1993 as a changing climate brings more pronounced and prolonged droughts cities in semi arid regions must develop resilience in their water supply systems using strategies such as redundancy diversity and buffer capacity jiménez cisneros et al 2014 rodina 2019 therefore although such cities might have previously relied almost exclusively on imported water use of urban aquifers is now expanding scanlon et al 2016 studies regarding sources of groundwater recharge in urban regions have previously been scarce but a new branch of hydrogeology urban groundwater has emerged to address the measurement and characterization of this valuable water source vázquez suñé et al 2010 1 1 urban groundwater processes urbanization affects physical and chemical groundwater processes urban infrastructure alters flow pathways by increasing impervious land cover importing water and introducing drainage swales septic tanks and man made drainage networks hibbs 2016 these modifications lead to more complex pathways of groundwater recharge than in a natural environment point and non point source pollution including sewage leaks and leaching of gasoline or fertilizers contaminate groundwater appleyard 1995 moglen 2009 urban centers are typically responding to multiple water challenges including water supply water quality concerns and flood risk lee et al 2018 groundwater management requires information about sources of aquifer recharge which is often increased in urban and arid regions lerner 2002 direct recharge from infiltration of precipitation may decrease due to the high percentage of impervious surfaces however urban recharge is enhanced overall due to indirect recharge where impervious surfaces generate overland flow that discharges into channels or lakes and later infiltrates and due to nuisance runoff from over irrigation leaky pipes and septic tanks tubau et al 2017 hibbs 2016 groundwater processes are further altered in urban areas as the removal of natural vegetation may contribute to increased river flow and recharge from the streambed hibbs et al 2012 appleyard 1995 1 2 urban isotope hydrology stable water isotopes 18o 16o and 2h 1h can be used to trace water sources pathways and residence times fontes 1980 clark and fritz 1997 genereux and hooper 1998 isotopic fingerprints of source waters can determine the contributions of potential sources to an aquifer by using end member mixing analysis emma if isotopic endmembers are sufficiently different liu and yamanaka 2012 numerous studies have employed isotopes as tracers to study groundwater recharge in natural glacierized alpine or boreal regions liu and yamanaka 2012 meng et al 2015 peralta tapia et al 2015 urban water cycles are complex so applying stable isotope techniques in urban water represents a new frontier for isotope hydrology that may require revised assumptions and sampling schemes ehleringer et al 2016 nonetheless isotopic methods have helped assess the impact of urbanization on transit times soulsby et al 2014 and water quality follstad shah et al 2019 and the performance of stormwater control measures in urban streams jefferson et al 2015 kuhlemann et al 2020 provide a valuable overview of the urban water cycle using stable isotope analysis in berlin germany in urban environments spatial variation in ground and surface water sources occurs over small scales due to the interaction between natural and artificial drainage systems and the mixing of surface and groundwaters yu et al 2019 therefore urban applications of emma must carefully consider the appropriate isotopic end members for example baseflow is commonly used as an endmember but baseflow composition can change seasonally in urban watersheds bonneau et al 2018 similar problems with end members variation occur in intensively managed rural watersheds durand and torres 1996 and under snowmelt bansah and ali 2017 1 3 uncertainty estimates in isotope hydrology a variety of methods have been used to quantify uncertainty in emma source fractions under gaussian assumptions end member and sample uncertainties can be propagated to find the uncertainty in the fractions genereux 1998 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 a generalization of this approach is to take monte carlo samples of end members allowing observed and or non gaussian distributions joerin et al 2002 petermann et al 2018 durand and torres 1996 each sample is used to calculate the end member fractions and the sampling repeated resulting in a probability distribution of fractions an alternative method is to treat the end member distribution parameters as unknowns to be estimated during the uncertainty analysis e g soulsby et al 2003 moore and semmens 2008 open source software is available for monte carlo based isotope uncertainty analysis including g emma based on the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation method arendt et al 2015 delsman et al 2013 uncertainty in emma is increased when end members vary over space or time and when there are unknown water sources adams et al 2009 principal component analysis or clustering methods can be used to diagnose the number of end members and identify unknown end members güler and thyne 2004 hooper 2003 james and roulet 2006 ali et al 2010 markovich et al 2019 alternatively emma can be run by iteratively changing end member set size and composition to identify appropriate end members barthold et al 2011 monte carlo and bayesian methods have been adapted to include temporal and spatial variation joerin et al 2002 moore and semmens 2008 cable et al 2011 ogle et al 2014 expert knowledge is key in whether to treat variable end members as constant values with uncertainty or explicitly treat the temporal variation e g petermann et al 2018 1 4 study aims the aim of this study is to use stable isotopes to determine the sources and uncertainties of groundwater recharge stormflow and their interactions in the urban semi arid setting of mission valley groundwater basin in san diego california we identify urban runoff processes and recharge mechanisms at timescales from hourly to seasonal under a range of antecedent wetness conditions this knowledge will be valuable for future use of the aquifer within the municipal water supply system we quantify the uncertainty in the source fraction estimates and identify dominant sources of uncertainty uncertainty analysis is essential for isotope hydrology applications in urban environments where the isotope composition of water sources commonly varies over small time and space scales 2 study area san diego is the southernmost city in california and has a mediterranean climate evapotranspiration rates exceed precipitation rates for a majority of the year average temperature is 18 c and average annual precipitation is 0 25 0 33 m precipitation primarily occurs during winter the san diego river has experienced a transition from intermittent to perennial flow hypothesized to be caused by the introduction of imported water through residential or commercial use although not verified by field data sdrpf 2013 the san diego river is representative of the surrounding five major river basins that drain to the san diego coastal plain also including the san dieguito river sweetwater river otay river and tijuana river soils geology topography and climate are similar in all the basins flint et al 2012 and imported water is important in all urban areas in the region these basins have a combined drainage area of 8000 km2 and span the u s mexico border the 30 km2 mission valley groundwater basin underlies the san diego river close to its outlet on the pacific coast fig 1 the shallow alluvial basin is composed of medium to coarse sand and gravel with average thickness of 25 m its storage capacity is estimated at 49 3 million m3 but only 0 62 million m3 yr are pumped from the aquifer sdcwa 1997 groundwater salinity varies over the basin resulting from saltwater intrusion prior to 1950 with some intrusion along san diego bay that may be due to groundwater pumping lower precipitation or rising sea level anders et al 2014 groundwater recharge direct from vertical infiltration of precipitation is episodic modeling for the san diego region suggests that 90 of recharge occurred in just 3 of a 27 year period flint et al 2012 infiltration of stream flow from the san diego river is hypothesized to be a primary recharge source california s groundwater bulletin 2004 because san diego imports 90 of its water there has not previously been a pressing need to characterize the groundwater anders et al 2014 however a prolonged drought reduced imported water by 31 and future projections suggest increasing water demand 46 increase by 2035 alongside reduced availability 12 reduction of streamflow san diego foundation 2014 these stressors have encouraged the san diego county water authority to diversify its water supplies with a plan to expand groundwater use from 0 in 1991 to 6 by 2020 sdcwa 2016 constraints to groundwater use in san diego county include water quality lack of hydrogeologic information and salinity sdcwa 1997 2016 runoff in the densely populated area is polluted from automobile byproducts fertilizers and gravel mining sdsu 2005 in the mission valley groundwater basin the main source of contamination is from a 1100 m3 gasoline leak during 1987 1991 from the mission valley terminal tank storage facility city of san diego 2018 city of san diego monitors groundwater wells in the aquifer for the resulting contaminants methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and tertiary butyl alcohol tba as well as iron and manganese that dissolve into groundwater when dissolved oxygen levels are low due to biodegradation of mtbe trends over the period 2011 2019 show decreases in mtbe to within drinking water standards with a corresponding increase in its breakdown product tba no seasonal patterns are evident but local events such as pumping tests are visible in the series lippman and turner 2019 remediation is ongoing via in place soil vapor extraction and extraction and treatment of groundwater some sections of the river are channelized to reduce flooding while others have habitat restoration projects to improve water quality sdrpf 2013 channelization typically leads to poorer groundwater quality with the loss of soil as a natural filter alessio et al 2018 southern california is susceptible to wildfires at the urban rural interface which can increase sediment delivery and reduce water quality improved characterisation of the urban water cycle stormwater pathways and groundwater recharge sources will assist sustainable management of the aquifer as a water resource for the area 3 methods 3 1 data collection in this study we sought to identify the dynamics of water sources contributing to stormflow and groundwater recharge the sources considered were precipitation imported water and pre event baseflow the last is separated during analysis into pre and post evaporation baseflow see section 3 2 2 samples of stormflow groundwater and source waters were taken in the san diego river sdr drainage area 1005 km2 impervious surface area 6 9 and two of its tributaries murphy canyon creek mc drainage area 28 7 km2 impervious surface area 23 5 and alvarado creek ac drainage area 28 0 km2 impervious surface area 50 1 and analyzed for stable isotopes 18o 16o and 2h and h the isotopic compositions of each source end members were used in end member mixing analysis emma to calculate percentages of each source contributing to a water body barthold et al 2011 flow records were taken from the usgs gauging station 11023000 san diego river at fashion valley fig 1 3 1 1 stormflow sampling eight storm events from 0 18 to 3 99 cm in size were sampled over a two year period 2017 2019 fig 2 samples of stream water were taken every hour for 8 24 hours table 1 to capture isotope variability during storms at each of three locations sdr mc ac for the 2017 18 winter season 4 storms grab samples were taken every hour for 8 h at the stream thalweg for the 2018 19 winter season 4 storms hourly samples were obtained using a teledyne 3700 autosampler for 12 h 3 events and 24 h 1 event 3 1 2 precipitation sampling precipitation samples were collected adjacent to each flow sampling location using a stratus precision rain gauge covered with a ball to prevent evaporation samples collected using this ball in funnel type collector can be used for isotopic analysis when recovered within 5 days prechsl et al 2014 during two storms samples of precipitation were taken hourly at one location to monitor isotopic composition changes during a rainfall event for these storms a volume weighted average of isotopic compositions was calculated using hourly rainfall totals from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration rain gauge at san diego airport 10 1 km from the sample sites 3 1 3 baseflow sampling baseflow samples were taken from the three stream locations during low flow periods in fall 2017 and summer fall 2018 table 1 using the same procedure as for stormflow grab samples 3 1 4 imported water imported water data were obtained from a concurrent project quantifying the percent attribution of low flows to imported water in the san diego river biggs et al 2019 tap water samples were collected bi weekly from may october 2018 from municipal water supplies at four locations that feed into the mission valley groundwater basin because san diego imports 90 of its municipal water supply tap water samples were assumed to reflect the imported water entering the aquifer by way of nuisance runoff from over irrigation or leaky pipes clifford and hibbs 2020 confirm that urban runoff sampled in street gutters is close in composition to tap water in a southern california case study imported water composition can change over time due to temporal variability in the isotopic composition of a given source e g colorado river and to changes in the mix of water used at a given time colorado river versus state water project the range of isotopic variability of the major imported water sources colorado river δ18o 12 1 and the state water project 9 0 8 williams 1997 is small compared with the difference between these two sources 3 1 5 groundwater groundwater 18o 16o and 2h h data were obtained from a groundwater quality monitoring project and were collected in 2018 from four usgs wells that sample the mission valley groundwater basin lippman and turner 2018 the depth to water in each well ranged from 3 58 m to 6 21 m indicating that water table level is close to the level of the river bed data from 16 samples were available from the four wells on four dates in 2018 31 jan 18 30 apr 18 31 jul 18 and 30 oct 18 average groundwater isotopic composition from these samples is δ18o of 5 04 and δd of 37 5 3 1 6 sample analysis los gatos research s off axis cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy technology was used to determine the isotopic compositions of each source the results were expressed as δ18o and δd which are the ratios of 18o 16o and d h relative to standard mean ocean water with units in per mil 3 2 end member mixing analysis end member mixing analysis emma is a process that uses tracers to determine the percentages of each source water contributing to a water body the number of tracers stables isotopes in our case needed for emma depends on the number of potential sources if the number of sources is n n 1 tracers are needed for analysis here we had up to 3 sources contributing to stormflow or groundwater at any given time requiring 2 tracers for mixing analysis barthold et al 2011 the tracers we used were the two isotope ratios δ18o and δd these tracers were measured in each potential source which are referred to as endmembers and in the target water body accurate identification of endmembers is essential in emma and is described in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 below after endmembers were defined emma was used to quantify the fractional contributions fi of each of n sources to the target waters stormflow or groundwater emma solves n simultaneous eqs 1 and 2 with the least squares method using n 1 tracers here δ18o and δd these equations state that the fractional contributions must sum to one i e that all water is accounted for eq 1 and that the weighted average of the tracer concentrations in each source must sum to the concentration in the target water eq 2 measured tracer concentrations are cj i for source i and tracer j and cj t for target water and tracer j emma assumes that tracers are conservative and non reactive that endmembers are isotopically distinct that temporal and spatial variations are known and that unmeasured components do not contribute significantly 1 i 1 n f i 1 2 i 1 n c i j f i c t j j 1 t o n 1 3 2 1 end member selection the following endmembers were considered as possible sources of stormflow in the san diego river precipitation post evaporation baseflow pre evaporation baseflow see next section and imported water precipitation and post evaporation baseflow isotope values were plotted to assess whether separate end members were needed for each storm or location or whether a single value was suitable based on these decisions potential end members were calculated for each storm when stormflow values lie close to the mixing line between two endmembers and outside of the bounding area between the three nearest sources only those two endmembers were used otherwise the three nearest endmembers bounding the stormflow values as vertices of a triangle were used for a maximum three endmembers in our emma analysis when stormflow did not lie within a bounding triangle this suggested an unrecognized additional water source or uncertainty in the stormflow or end member isotope values see discussion section 5 3 3 2 2 pre evaporation baseflow endmember between storm events water can exchange between groundwater and river base flow via return flow and channel infiltration during this process water may be subject to evaporation and isotopic fractionation as heavier isotopes preferentially remain in the liquid phase in the san diego river numerous ponds have been created by gravel mining operations resulting in exposure of in channel water to evaporation in δ18o δd space evaporatively enriched water falls away from the global meteoric water line gmwl defining the local evaporation line lel given that the baseflow we sampled might have undergone evaporation after its interaction with groundwater we included baseflow in its pre evaporation composition as an endmember this endmember is representative of local shallow groundwater that has not interacted with the channel and only discharged to the stream during a storm event to calculate this endmember the lel was fitted as a regression through all baseflow samples and projected onto the gmwl we compared the fitted lel slope with a previous study in san diego by biggs et al 2019 who used an alternative method based on temperature and relative humidity data benettin et al 2018 we thus distinguished between baseflow that was generated from in channel sources upstream of a sampling point that have undergone evaporation and subsurface sources that contributed to flow during storm events before being exposed to evaporation 3 3 uncertainty analysis uncertainty sources include accuracy in isotopic analysis accuracy in streamflow measurement and the representativeness of rainfall and baseflow samples for the entire water body that they represent we estimated the uncertainty in each source and calculated uncertainty in the resulting estimates of the rainfall baseflow and pre evaporation baseflow fractions that contributed to stormflow and groundwater 3 3 1 uncertainty of isotope analysis procedure two replicates from each sample were analyzed for δd and δ18o for standard emma procedure we took the average of the two results for uncertainty analysis we calculated the difference in δd and δ18o values in each pair we summarized these differences across all samples because all laboratory analyses used the same equipment with the same uncertainties the differences were plotted as histograms and fitted with normal distributions to enable us to take random samples of potential error values 3 3 2 uncertainty in end member definition uncertainty was calculated for each end member the precipitation end member for a storm was the mean of three cumulative samples from alvarado creek murphy canyon and san diego river assuming that these samples were taken from a normally distributed precipitation field we calculated the standard error in the mean we added to this the error from the isotope analysis procedure assuming that these two error sources were independent the baseflow end member was the mean of seven baseflow samples for each site baseflow did not show seasonal variability so an arithmetic mean of all values was used we used the same procedure as for precipitation but allowed for covariance between δd and δ18o values because baseflow samples lie along the diagonal lel the pre evaporation baseflow endmember was the projection of the baseflow value along the lel until it intersects the gmwl we used monte carlo sampling to combine uncertainty in baseflow and lel slope slope values between 3 8 and 4 1 the average and springtime slopes to find total uncertainty in the pre evaporated baseflow 3 3 3 uncertainty in volume weighted storm flow we modeled flow values as having gaussian error with standard deviation of 10 of the flow value as error bounds of 10 20 are typical for medium or high in bank flows mcmillan et al 2012 each sample was assumed to have isotope analysis uncertainty as above monte carlo sampling was used to combine the flow and isotope uncertainties for uncertainty in the volume weighted average 3 3 4 uncertainty in storm flow and groundwater source fractions to determine the combined impact of the uncertainties above we used monte carlo sampling similar to delsman et al 2013 for 10 000 replicates we drew random samples from the end members and target water distributions and used these values in emma calculation of water source fractions this gave a distribution of water source fractions from which we calculated the standard deviation as a measure of the source fraction uncertainty 4 results 4 1 end member mixing analysis 4 1 1 end member calculation endmembers considered as possible sources of stormflow for each event in the san diego river were precipitation post evaporation baseflow pre evaporation baseflow and imported water table 2 san diego precipitation varied isotopically among storm events depending on the source and direction of rainfall bearing air masses the differences among locations were small compared to differences between events fig 3 a two factor anova statistical test showed that between storm differences account for 99 of the total variation in isotopes based on this finding we recommend that event specific precipitation endmembers should be used but that the isotopic values from the three locations can be averaged to give a single end member the imported water endmember was determined by averaging the isotopic values of tap water at four locations sampled in summer 2018 as reported by biggs et al 2019 δ18o of 11 43 and δd of 93 5 which had minimal variation standard deviation 0 5 in δ18o compared with the difference between imported water and other endmembers the isotopic values are similar to colorado river water williams 1997 reflecting san diego s strong reliance on the colorado river for its water supply the baseflow endmember was calculated as an average of all samples taken from the mission valley section of the san diego river δ18o of 1 88 and δd of 23 6 baseflow samples collected were isotopically enriched and δ18o and δd values fell far from the gmwl indicating baseflow was heavily evaporated the lel was fitted to the baseflow samples giving a slope of 4 07 falling within the range of 3 5 4 8 for san diego gibson et al 2008 biggs et al 2019 calculated the lel for the san diego region using an alternative method that uses temperature and relative humidity data benettin et al 2018 this gave an average slope of 3 8 varying between a summer minimum of 3 5 and a spring maximum of 4 1 our regression slope was close to the upper bound and we used this springtime lel slope 4 07 in our analysis the average lel slope 3 8 was included during uncertainty analysis for comparison the lels were used to project baseflow values onto the gmwl giving similar pre evaporation baseflow values for springtime δ18o of 6 58 and δd of 42 8 and average δ18o of 6 18 and δd of 39 4 lels the same process was followed to give pre evaporation baseflow endmembers for alvarado creek with δ18o of 8 30 and δd of 56 4 and for murphy canyon with δ18o of 8 22 and δd of 55 8 endmembers were selected according to the procedure in section 3 2 1 all endmembers and reference lines for the sdr location are summarized in fig 4 4 2 storm component analysis 4 2 1 san diego river an overview of stormwater source fractions is given in fig 5 stormflow isotopic values typically fell between baseflow and pre evaporation baseflow with little input from precipitation or imported water the exception is the november 29th 2018 storm where stormflow was largely reflective of precipitation imported water input was insignificant except in one event where 8 9 came from imported water where precipitation was so small that discharge was more reflective of low flow than stormflow mixing diagrams are demonstrated in fig 6 for the storms of january 5th 2019 baseflow dominated and november 29th 2018 precipitation dominated mixing diagrams for the remaining storms are similar to fig 6a and are shown in the supplementary material fig s1 pre evaporation baseflow was the dominant source for 5 of the 8 storms 4 2 2 san diego river within storm isotopic variation we used hourly stormwater samples to investigate how water sources change during an event two examples are given in fig 7 which show the δ18o signatures superimposed on precipitation and streamflow values and the remaining events are shown in the supplementary material fig s2 fig 7a shows that the three earliest samples were similar to precipitation later in the storm isotope values moved towards the baseflow composition fig 7b shows that pre event values were reflective of post evaporation baseflow and moved towards the precipitation endmember as rain entered the river before returning to pre event values characteristic of a mix between baseflow and pre evaporation baseflow overall flow early in an event was dominated by precipitation suggesting a combination of direct precipitation into the riparian zone combined with runoff from impervious surfaces dominates early in the storm with in channel and subsurface sources dominating during peak discharge and the falling limb of the storm hydrograph note that although precipitation contributed strongly to the start of events the flow was then low compared to the peak of the event therefore when volume weighted sources of water were calculated for the whole event the precipitation contribution was negligible as demonstrated by the emma analysis fig 5 4 2 3 alvarado creek and murphy canyon tributaries in contrast to the mainstem stormflow in the alvarado creek and murphy canyon tributaries showed isotope composition close to the precipitation endmember see fig 8 a for an example in most events at alvarado creek there was not enough endmember separation for emma two storms did show enough separation march 15th 2018 stormflow consisted of 8 pre evaporation baseflow 16 baseflow and 77 precipitation while the january 17th 2019 stormflow consisted of 17 evaporated baseflow and 83 precipitation at murphy canyon the march 15th 2018 stormflow consisted of 27 pre evaporation baseflow and 73 precipitation and the january 17th 2019 stormflow consisted of 23 pre evaporation baseflow and 77 precipitation due to rounding numbers may not sum to 100 thus stormflow in both locations was primarily 70 85 attributed to precipitation input suggesting impervious runoff fig 8b shows all total precipitation stormflow and baseflow samples for alvarado creek with reference to the gmwl lel and imported water endmember murphy canyon showed a similar pattern not shown during individual events the isotopic composition of stormflow fell on the gmwl although not always adjacent to the precipitation endmember the fact that almost all stormwater samples fell close to gmwl suggests the majority of source water contributing to the stormflow in these tributaries had a direct precipitation origin 4 3 groundwater mixing analysis groundwater samples from wells in the mission valley groundwater basin were similar in composition to stormflow and fell along the mixing line of the pre evaporation baseflow and post evaporation baseflow endmembers from the san diego river emma results indicated that around 2 3rd of groundwater was composed of pre evaporation baseflow while 1 3rd was composed of post evaporation baseflow the percent of post evaporation baseflow ranged from 23 6 to 39 1 fig 11 because stormflow showed the same mixing between these two endmembers we were unable to separate recharge occurring during storms and recharge occurring from the infiltration of baseflow over longer time periods nevertheless post evaporation baseflow was contributing a substantial amount to both stormflow and groundwater groundwater composition was similar throughout the year fig 11 suggesting that recharge occurs over longer decadal timescales so that seasonal recharge is a small proportion of the total volume and does not create fluctuations in the groundwater isotopes groundwater composition showed slight spatial variations well db 2 a had 10 lower contribution from baseflow than the other wells fig 11 despite being within 15 m horizontally and 0 26 m screen depth from wells db 2 and db 2 b 4 4 uncertainty analysis 4 4 1 uncertainty in isotope analysis differences in isotope values between the sample pairs were calculated and used to fit normal distributions fig 9 the distribution means are not significantly different from zero as expected and the standard deviations are 0 21 for δ18o and 0 77 for δd these values are small compared to the range of δ18o and δd values sampled 4 4 2 uncertainty in end member definition uncertainties for each end member were found by combining the uncertainties in individual isotope samples flow values end members and lel slope for each storm monte carlo samples were taken from each distribution as illustrated in fig 10 for the 9 jan 18 storm event the largest uncertainties were in the rainfall and post evaporation baseflow end members the imported water endmember was important for only one storm and the variability in the isotopic signature of tap water was low 0 5 so we did not carry out monte carlo analysis for that endmember 4 4 3 uncertainty in stormwater and groundwater source fractions based on the uncertainty distributions for each end member we calculated the uncertainties in the source fractions table 3 while the uncertainties are typically 6 the storm of 11 mar 18 showed high uncertainty values 18 because precipitation and pre evaporation baseflow isotopes could not be distinguished excluding these outliers the average error expressed as a standard deviation was 4 9 or as 90 confidence bounds of 8 0 for example a storm that has 40 evaporated base flow would have 90 confidence bounds of 32 48 using the same method we calculated confidence bounds on the percentage of post evaporation baseflow in the each groundwater sample fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 what do isotope dynamics in san diego tell us about runoff and recharge processes in urban arid environments 5 1 1 seasonal annual timescales our results show that at a seasonal annual timescale new precipitation only provides a substantial volumetric contribution to runoff volume in the first event after the dry summer season during the wet winter season runoff is a mixture of post evaporation baseflow representative of shallow groundwater that has undergone evaporation after discharging into the river and was present in channel immediately prior to the storm event and pre evaporation baseflow representative of groundwater that has not interacted with the channel and only discharged to the stream during the storm event later in the wet season the post evaporation baseflow decreases and the pre evaporation baseflow increases indicating that heavily evaporated in channel sources had been flushed and that groundwater discharge to the stream dominates this groundwater discharge can be viewed as an indirect contribution with precipitation origin as it comprises return flow from a baseflow pool of precipitation that recharged the groundwater in previous storm events we interpret these results to imply that the amount of pre event water present in the stream during a storm is a function of hydrologic connectivity between the channel and water stored in the hillslope groundwater or surface ponds when connectivity is low following a dry summer little upstream surface water or groundwater will be discharged to the stream therefore stormflow from the first event of the winter season consists of precipitation and new runoff from impervious surfaces this finding is consistent with studies in non urban watersheds where dry antecedent conditions led to much greater percentages of new water james and roulet 2009 penna et al 2015 for subsequent events hydrologic connectivity is greater and stormflow consists largely of pre event surface and groundwater that is flushed from upstream as the winter progresses past the initial flush of pre event water the proportion of post evaporation baseflow declines and younger seasonal water predominates we present a conceptual model of water sources for the river and groundwater and their seasonal changes in fig 12 5 1 2 event time scales at an event time scale streamflow is diluted isotopically by precipitation during the early rising limb of the hydrograph subsequently streamflow is supplied by a mixture of pre and post evaporation baseflow as isotope values move back towards pre event signatures this pattern suggests that stormflow discharge includes groundwater return flow meriano et al 2011 similarly found that groundwater contributed 20 30 of flow volume during an urban storm event challenging the view that groundwater does not significantly contribute to urban stormflow we note that direct precipitation contribution to overall stormflow volume is negligible because higher flows later in the event are dominated by pre and post evaporation baseflow our results show that new precipitation influences the start of the hydrograph and contrast with previous studies that found pre event water dominates the start of the hydrograph with new water contributions lagging behind the hydrograph peak nolan and hill 1990 pellerin et al 2008 we hypothesize that the precipitation influence at the start of hydrograph is due to impervious contributions from the urban area the large contribution of in channel water and groundwater to stormflow in the mainstem sdr may be attributed in part to a large artificial ponds that store water in channel upstream of the sampling site and b the intact floodplain of the san diego river that maintains near channel sources of groundwater that can be mobilized during a storm event 5 1 3 tributary flows the alvarado creek and murphy canyon tributaries have very low flows during non storm periods typically less than 1 m3s 1 and so have little pre event water to contribute to stormflow neither tributary watershed has significant upstream ponding or in channel storage accordingly the isotopic results show that their stormflow is attributed to precipitation rather than old water that has been displaced and rapidly mobilized by precipitation as is typical in non urban environments the old water paradox kirchner 2003 buttle 1994 larger new precipitation contributions are expected in watersheds with higher percentages of impervious surface cover hasenmueller et al 2017 and the alvarado creek and murphy canyon tributaries follow that behaviour 5 2 what are the implications of isotopic results for sustainable groundwater management in san diego insight as to how the water enters an aquifer can inform management practices to improve water quality our results show that groundwater has an isotopic composition very similar to that of stormflow a mix of 1 3rd post evaporation baseflow and 2 3rds pre evaporation baseflow this similarity suggests close surface subsurface connection and water movement between streamflow and groundwater implying that efforts to improve groundwater quality must include improving and sustaining surface water quality further evidence for connection between streamflow and groundwater comes from significant total coliform levels detected in one of the groundwater wells up to 2400 mpn 100 ml thought to originate from the river to provide additional evidence future studies could consider monitoring river water for geochemical composition over time for comparison with groundwater samples one target for water quality improvement measures should be the post evaporation baseflow i e river water that has been present as surface water long enough to undergo evaporation this water composes 1 3rd of groundwater with this recharge hypothesized to occur from the river channel either gradually during low flow periods or during storm periods when this water is re mobilized from slow moving reaches of the river a second target for water quality improvement should be the first flush storm event of the winter this event transports unusually high levels of new precipitation direct to the river and water quality is typically poor due to the flushing of summer buildup of trash microbes and other pollutants ahn et al 2005 jiang et al 2001 digiacomo et al 2004 research into urban stormwater management is scarce for arid regions and for locations where stormwater interacts with groundwater jefferson et al 2017 regier et al 2020 the impact of urbanization and stormwater mitigation techniques on the hydrologic budget is still an open research question wenger et al 2009 however information on the recharge sources above can be used to evaluate possible management strategies for example for the first flush event riparian wetlands help prevent overland flow from reaching the channel gremillion et al 2000 for the channel unlined urban channels show lower event water contributions than cement lined channels hasenmueller and robinson 2016 both alvarado creek and murphy canyon are partially cement lined restoration projects under consideration for these streams promote unlined areas given the high percentage of event rainfall water present in these creeks they provide a promising target for water quality improvement as small urban tributaries can be a major source of water quality contaminants to their downstream rivers aleksander kwaterczak and plenzler 2019 5 3 what is the impact of end member complexity on urban tracer studies our results demonstrate the challenges of using isotopic mixing analysis in urban environments that typically have high spatial and temporal variation in flow pathways and therefore isotopic concentrations yu et al 2019 follstad shah et al 2019 in a study by bazemore et al 1994 spatial variation in endmembers was the most significant source of uncertainty in event water source fractions which reached 20 our study showed high temporal variability in isotopes due to a pulse of fast runoff of new precipitation followed by contributions from groundwater and remobilized pre event surface water one consequence of isotopic variability is that streamflow samples may fall outside the emma mixing triangle of potential end members due to missing or un representative endmembers vázquez suñé et al 2010 we observed this pattern in alvarado creek and murphy canyon and several explanations are possible first similarly to bonneau et al 2018 we found that baseflow isotopes showed significant variation so the average baseflow endmember may not be representative for a particular event second the temporal variability in isotopic values that we found in rainfall not shown due to short term amount effects i e an inverse relationship between rainfall intensity and isotopic value mook and rozanski 2000 might lead to a rainfall endmember that changes during a storm event lastly unmeasured channel inflows e g sewer or storm drain overflow mendoza et al 2020 could introduce an unknown endmember to create sampling protocols that are robust to the urban environment several changes are recommended the examples above explain the high uncertainties that we found in precipitation and baseflow endmembers therefore isotopic studies in urban environments will benefit from higher temporal resolution sampling of these endmembers to reduce the uncertainties in source fractions for stormflow and groundwater for example baseflow could be sampled immediately prior to each event to provide an event specific endmember additional cumulative rainfall samples throughout the watersheds would be valuable as oceanic and continental air masses mix over san diego farlin et al 2013 better specification of tributary endmembers will be particularly useful as their fast runoff is a probable source of pollutants into the river and eventually into the groundwater basin 6 conclusion in the san diego river and mission valley groundwater basin we sampled rainfall stormflow groundwater baseflow and calculated pre evaporation baseflow as an additional endmember stormflow and groundwater had very similar isotopic compositions in the mainstem stormwater was on average composed of 28 post evaporation baseflow and 69 pre evaporation baseflow with minimal direct contributions from rainfall or imported water groundwater samples were composed of 32 post evaporation baseflow and 68 pre evaporation baseflow we conclude that the river and groundwater systems are tightly connected stormflow consists largely of pre event surface water and groundwater return flow that is flushed from upstream mixing with existing baseflow we hypothesize that the dominance of pre event water is due to significant in channel storage and an intact floodplain the exception was for the first event after the summer season which was composed of 85 new precipitation implying that dry conditions prevent connectivity and lead to overland flow as the primary runoff generation mechanism tributary flows by contrast were composed of primarily 75 of new precipitation deriving from fast runoff of new water as is typical of urban stormflow this reflects a lack of in channel sources disconnection from the floodplain and higher impervious surface coverage in the main san diego river hourly samples did show limited impact of new precipitation in the rising limb however this influence was not sufficient to substantially impact the overall stormflow composition the source fractions have 90 confidence bounds of 8 0 the largest uncertainty sources are in the rainfall and post evaporation baseflow endmembers these endmembers are assumed isotopically constant but measurements showed variation over space rainfall and time both rainfall and baseflow the study confirmed previous findings that urban baseflow isotopes vary substantially over time we therefore recommend higher resolution baseflow sampling to reduce uncertainty for isotopic mixing analysis in urban areas overall our results show that isotopic sampling is valuable for analysis of groundwater and stormflow sources in urban environments our findings made it possible to recommend management interventions to improve surface water and groundwater quality and therefore promote use of urban groundwater as a water resource credit authorship

8273,study region in this study we use stable isotopes of water to quantify the flow pathways delivering water to the tributaries mainstem river and groundwater basin underlying urban san diego information about sources of stormflow and recharge are necessary to maintain the health of waterways and aquifers but studies of these processes are scarce in urban semi arid regions study focus isotopic methods have been used in experimental or natural watersheds but also have potential to quantify urban water cycling behaviour and water sources we sampled baseflow precipitation and hourly stormflow from eight events with a range of antecedent conditions and used end member mixing analysis to determine stormflow and groundwater sources new hydrological insights for the region our results show that hydrologic connectivity controls stormflow sources after a dry summer and early in storm events connectivity of pre event water with the channel is low so only new precipitation reaches the river in wetter conditions connectivity is higher and pre event surface water mixes with infiltration origin groundwater deeper groundwater composition mimics stormflow a mix of stagnated river water and infiltration origin water the close connection between streamflow and groundwater implies that improving groundwater quality requires improvements to surface water quality average uncertainty in source fractions was 8 0 suggesting that despite complex water pathways in urban semi arid environments isotopic sampling is valuable for quantifying water sources keywords stable isotopes end member mixing analysis urban semi arid aquifer watershed 1 introduction most people live in urban environments with a projected 70 of the world population living in urbanized areas by the year 2050 united nations 2007 to meet growing water demand urban areas have steadily increased their reliance on groundwater globally groundwater use accounts for about one third of all freshwater consumption gleick 1993 as a changing climate brings more pronounced and prolonged droughts cities in semi arid regions must develop resilience in their water supply systems using strategies such as redundancy diversity and buffer capacity jiménez cisneros et al 2014 rodina 2019 therefore although such cities might have previously relied almost exclusively on imported water use of urban aquifers is now expanding scanlon et al 2016 studies regarding sources of groundwater recharge in urban regions have previously been scarce but a new branch of hydrogeology urban groundwater has emerged to address the measurement and characterization of this valuable water source vázquez suñé et al 2010 1 1 urban groundwater processes urbanization affects physical and chemical groundwater processes urban infrastructure alters flow pathways by increasing impervious land cover importing water and introducing drainage swales septic tanks and man made drainage networks hibbs 2016 these modifications lead to more complex pathways of groundwater recharge than in a natural environment point and non point source pollution including sewage leaks and leaching of gasoline or fertilizers contaminate groundwater appleyard 1995 moglen 2009 urban centers are typically responding to multiple water challenges including water supply water quality concerns and flood risk lee et al 2018 groundwater management requires information about sources of aquifer recharge which is often increased in urban and arid regions lerner 2002 direct recharge from infiltration of precipitation may decrease due to the high percentage of impervious surfaces however urban recharge is enhanced overall due to indirect recharge where impervious surfaces generate overland flow that discharges into channels or lakes and later infiltrates and due to nuisance runoff from over irrigation leaky pipes and septic tanks tubau et al 2017 hibbs 2016 groundwater processes are further altered in urban areas as the removal of natural vegetation may contribute to increased river flow and recharge from the streambed hibbs et al 2012 appleyard 1995 1 2 urban isotope hydrology stable water isotopes 18o 16o and 2h 1h can be used to trace water sources pathways and residence times fontes 1980 clark and fritz 1997 genereux and hooper 1998 isotopic fingerprints of source waters can determine the contributions of potential sources to an aquifer by using end member mixing analysis emma if isotopic endmembers are sufficiently different liu and yamanaka 2012 numerous studies have employed isotopes as tracers to study groundwater recharge in natural glacierized alpine or boreal regions liu and yamanaka 2012 meng et al 2015 peralta tapia et al 2015 urban water cycles are complex so applying stable isotope techniques in urban water represents a new frontier for isotope hydrology that may require revised assumptions and sampling schemes ehleringer et al 2016 nonetheless isotopic methods have helped assess the impact of urbanization on transit times soulsby et al 2014 and water quality follstad shah et al 2019 and the performance of stormwater control measures in urban streams jefferson et al 2015 kuhlemann et al 2020 provide a valuable overview of the urban water cycle using stable isotope analysis in berlin germany in urban environments spatial variation in ground and surface water sources occurs over small scales due to the interaction between natural and artificial drainage systems and the mixing of surface and groundwaters yu et al 2019 therefore urban applications of emma must carefully consider the appropriate isotopic end members for example baseflow is commonly used as an endmember but baseflow composition can change seasonally in urban watersheds bonneau et al 2018 similar problems with end members variation occur in intensively managed rural watersheds durand and torres 1996 and under snowmelt bansah and ali 2017 1 3 uncertainty estimates in isotope hydrology a variety of methods have been used to quantify uncertainty in emma source fractions under gaussian assumptions end member and sample uncertainties can be propagated to find the uncertainty in the fractions genereux 1998 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 a generalization of this approach is to take monte carlo samples of end members allowing observed and or non gaussian distributions joerin et al 2002 petermann et al 2018 durand and torres 1996 each sample is used to calculate the end member fractions and the sampling repeated resulting in a probability distribution of fractions an alternative method is to treat the end member distribution parameters as unknowns to be estimated during the uncertainty analysis e g soulsby et al 2003 moore and semmens 2008 open source software is available for monte carlo based isotope uncertainty analysis including g emma based on the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation method arendt et al 2015 delsman et al 2013 uncertainty in emma is increased when end members vary over space or time and when there are unknown water sources adams et al 2009 principal component analysis or clustering methods can be used to diagnose the number of end members and identify unknown end members güler and thyne 2004 hooper 2003 james and roulet 2006 ali et al 2010 markovich et al 2019 alternatively emma can be run by iteratively changing end member set size and composition to identify appropriate end members barthold et al 2011 monte carlo and bayesian methods have been adapted to include temporal and spatial variation joerin et al 2002 moore and semmens 2008 cable et al 2011 ogle et al 2014 expert knowledge is key in whether to treat variable end members as constant values with uncertainty or explicitly treat the temporal variation e g petermann et al 2018 1 4 study aims the aim of this study is to use stable isotopes to determine the sources and uncertainties of groundwater recharge stormflow and their interactions in the urban semi arid setting of mission valley groundwater basin in san diego california we identify urban runoff processes and recharge mechanisms at timescales from hourly to seasonal under a range of antecedent wetness conditions this knowledge will be valuable for future use of the aquifer within the municipal water supply system we quantify the uncertainty in the source fraction estimates and identify dominant sources of uncertainty uncertainty analysis is essential for isotope hydrology applications in urban environments where the isotope composition of water sources commonly varies over small time and space scales 2 study area san diego is the southernmost city in california and has a mediterranean climate evapotranspiration rates exceed precipitation rates for a majority of the year average temperature is 18 c and average annual precipitation is 0 25 0 33 m precipitation primarily occurs during winter the san diego river has experienced a transition from intermittent to perennial flow hypothesized to be caused by the introduction of imported water through residential or commercial use although not verified by field data sdrpf 2013 the san diego river is representative of the surrounding five major river basins that drain to the san diego coastal plain also including the san dieguito river sweetwater river otay river and tijuana river soils geology topography and climate are similar in all the basins flint et al 2012 and imported water is important in all urban areas in the region these basins have a combined drainage area of 8000 km2 and span the u s mexico border the 30 km2 mission valley groundwater basin underlies the san diego river close to its outlet on the pacific coast fig 1 the shallow alluvial basin is composed of medium to coarse sand and gravel with average thickness of 25 m its storage capacity is estimated at 49 3 million m3 but only 0 62 million m3 yr are pumped from the aquifer sdcwa 1997 groundwater salinity varies over the basin resulting from saltwater intrusion prior to 1950 with some intrusion along san diego bay that may be due to groundwater pumping lower precipitation or rising sea level anders et al 2014 groundwater recharge direct from vertical infiltration of precipitation is episodic modeling for the san diego region suggests that 90 of recharge occurred in just 3 of a 27 year period flint et al 2012 infiltration of stream flow from the san diego river is hypothesized to be a primary recharge source california s groundwater bulletin 2004 because san diego imports 90 of its water there has not previously been a pressing need to characterize the groundwater anders et al 2014 however a prolonged drought reduced imported water by 31 and future projections suggest increasing water demand 46 increase by 2035

expand groundwater use from 0 in 1991 to 6 by 2020 sdcwa 2016 constraints to groundwater use in san diego county include water quality lack of hydrogeologic information and salinity sdcwa 1997 2016

contaminants methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and tertiary butyl alcohol tba as well as iron and manganese that dissolve into groundwater when dissolved oxygen levels are low due to biodegradation of mtbe trends over the period 2011 2019 show decreases in mtbe to within drinking water standards with a corresponding increase in its breakdown product tba no seasonal patterns are evident but local events such as pumping tests are visible in the series lippman and turner 2019 remediation is ongoing via in place soil vapor extraction and extraction and treatment of groundwater some sections of the river are channelized to reduce flooding while others have habitat restoration projects to improve water quality sdrpf 2013 channelization typically leads to poorer groundwater quality with the loss of soil as a natural filter alessio et al 2018 southern california is susceptible to wildfires at the urban rural interface which can increase sediment delivery and reduce water quality improved characterisation of the urban water cycle stormwater pathways and groundwater recharge sources will assist sustainable management of the aquifer as a water resource for the area 3 methods 3 1 data collection in this study we sought to identify the dynamics of water sources contributing to stormflow and groundwater recharge the sources considered were precipitation imported water and pre event baseflow the last is separated during analysis into pre and post evaporation baseflow see section 3 2 2 samples of stormflow groundwater and source waters were taken in the san diego river sdr drainage area 1005 km2 impervious surface area 6 9 and two of its tributaries murphy canyon creek mc drainage area 28 7 km2 impervious surface area 23 5 and alvarado creek ac drainage area 28 0 km2 impervious surface area 50 1 and analyzed for stable isotopes 18o 16o and 2h and h the isotopic compositions of each source end members were used in end member mixing analysis emma to calculate percentages of each source contributing to a water body barthold et al 2011 flow records were taken from the usgs gauging station 11023000 san diego river at fashion valley fig 1 3 1 1 stormflow sampling eight storm events from 0 18 to 3 99 cm in size were sampled over a two year period 2017 2019 fig 2 samples of stream water were taken every hour for 8 24 hours table 1 to capture isotope variability during storms at each of three locations sdr mc ac for the 2017 18 winter season 4 storms grab samples were taken every hour for 8 h at the stream thalweg for the 2018 19 winter season 4 storms hourly samples were obtained using a teledyne 3700 autosampler for 12 h 3 events and 24 h 1 event 3 1 2 precipitation sampling precipitation samples were collected adjacent to each flow sampling location using a stratus precision rain gauge covered with a ball to prevent evaporation samples collected using this ball in funnel type collector can be used for isotopic analysis when recovered within 5 days prechsl et al 2014 during two storms samples of precipitation were taken hourly at one location to monitor isotopic composition changes during a rainfall event for these storms a volume weighted average of isotopic compositions was calculated using hourly rainfall totals from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration rain gauge at san diego airport 10 1 km from the sample sites 3 1 3 baseflow sampling baseflow samples were taken from the three stream locations during low flow periods in fall 2017 and summer fall 2018 table 1 using the same procedure as for stormflow grab samples 3 1 4 imported water imported water data were obtained from a concurrent project quantifying the percent attribution of low flows to imported water in the san diego river biggs et al 2019 tap water samples were collected bi weekly from may october 2018 from municipal water supplies at four locations that feed into the mission valley groundwater basin because san diego imports 90 of its municipal water supply tap water samples were assumed to reflect the imported water entering the aquifer by way of nuisance runoff from over irrigation or leaky pipes clifford and hibbs 2020 confirm that urban runoff sampled in street gutters is close in composition to tap water in a southern california case study imported water composition can change over time due to temporal variability in the isotopic composition of a given source e g colorado river and to changes in the mix of water used at a given time colorado river versus state water project the range of isotopic variability of the major imported water sources colorado river δ18o 12 1 and the state water project 9 0 8 williams 1997 is small compared with the difference between these two sources 3 1 5 groundwater groundwater 18o 16o and 2h h data were obtained from a groundwater quality monitoring project and were collected in 2018 from four usgs wells that sample the mission valley groundwater basin lippman and turner 2018 the depth to water in each well ranged from 3 58 m to 6 21 m indicating that water table level is close to the level of the river bed data from 16 samples were available from the four wells on four dates in 2018 31 jan 18 30 apr 18 31 jul 18 and 30 oct 18 average groundwater isotopic composition from these samples is δ18o of 5 04 and δd of 37 5 3 1 6 sample analysis los gatos research s off axis cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy technology was used to determine the isotopic compositions of each source the results were expressed as δ18o and δd which are the ratios of 18o 16o and d h relative to standard mean ocean water with units in per mil 3 2 end member mixing analysis end member mixing analysis emma is a process that uses tracers to determine the percentages of each source water contributing to a water body the number of tracers stables isotopes in our case needed for emma depends on the number of potential sources if the number of sources is n n 1 tracers are needed for analysis here we had up to 3 sources contributing to stormflow or groundwater at any given time requiring 2 tracers for mixing analysis barthold et al 2011 the tracers we used were the two isotope ratios δ18o and δd these tracers were measured in each potential source which are referred to as endmembers and in the target water body accurate identification of endmembers is essential in emma and is described in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 below after endmembers were defined emma was used to quantify the fractional contributions fi of each of n sources to the target waters stormflow or groundwater emma solves n simultaneous eqs 1 and 2 with the least squares method using n 1 tracers here δ18o and δd these equations state that the fractional contributions must sum to one i e that all water is accounted for eq 1 and that the weighted average of the tracer concentrations in each source must sum to the concentration in the target water eq 2 measured tracer concentrations are cj i for source i and tracer j and cj t for target water and tracer j emma assumes that tracers are conservative and non reactive that endmembers are isotopically distinct that temporal and spatial variations are known and that unmeasured components do not contribute significantly 1 i 1 n f i 1 2 i 1 n c i j f i c t j j 1 t o n 1 3 2 1 end member selection the following endmembers were considered as possible sources of stormflow in the san diego river precipitation post evaporation baseflow pre evaporation baseflow see next section and imported water precipitation and post evaporation baseflow isotope values were plotted to assess whether separate end members were needed for each storm or location or whether a single value was suitable based on these decisions potential end members were calculated for each storm when stormflow values lie close to the mixing line between two endmembers and outside of the bounding area between the three nearest sources only those two endmembers were used otherwise the three nearest endmembers bounding the stormflow values as vertices of a triangle were used for a maximum three endmembers in our emma analysis when stormflow did not lie within a bounding triangle this suggested an unrecognized additional water source or uncertainty in the stormflow or end member isotope values see discussion section 5 3 3 2 2 pre evaporation baseflow endmember between storm events water can exchange between groundwater and river base flow via return flow and channel infiltration during this process water may be subject to evaporation and isotopic fractionation as heavier isotopes preferentially remain in the liquid phase in the san diego river numerous ponds have been created by gravel mining operations resulting in exposure of in channel water to evaporation in δ18o δd space evaporatively enriched water falls away from the global meteoric water line gmwl defining the local evaporation line lel given that the baseflow we sampled might have undergone evaporation after its interaction with groundwater we included baseflow in its pre evaporation composition as an endmember this endmember is representative of local shallow groundwater that has not interacted with the channel and only discharged to the stream during a storm event to calculate this endmember the lel was fitted as a regression through all baseflow samples and projected onto the gmwl we compared the fitted lel slope with a previous study in san diego by biggs et al 2019 who used an alternative method based on temperature and relative humidity data benettin et al 2018 we thus distinguished between baseflow that was generated from in channel sources upstream of a sampling point that have undergone evaporation and subsurface sources that contributed to flow during storm events before being exposed to evaporation 3 3 uncertainty analysis uncertainty sources include accuracy in isotopic analysis accuracy in streamflow measurement and the representativeness of rainfall and baseflow samples for the entire water body that they represent we estimated the uncertainty in each source and calculated uncertainty in the resulting estimates of the rainfall baseflow and pre evaporation baseflow fractions that contributed to stormflow and groundwater 3 3 1 uncertainty of isotope analysis procedure two replicates from each sample were analyzed for δd and δ18o for standard emma procedure we took the average of the two results for uncertainty analysis we calculated the difference in δd and δ18o values in each pair we summarized these differences across all samples because all laboratory analyses used the same equipment with the same uncertainties the differences were plotted as histograms and fitted with normal distributions to enable us to take random samples of potential error values 3 3 2 uncertainty in end member definition uncertainty was calculated for each end member the precipitation end member for a storm was the mean of three cumulative samples from alvarado creek murphy canyon and san diego river assuming that these samples were taken from a normally distributed precipitation field we calculated the standard error in the mean we added to this the error from the isotope analysis procedure assuming that these two error sources were independent the baseflow end member was the mean of seven baseflow samples for each site baseflow did not show seasonal variability so an arithmetic mean of all values was used we used the same procedure as for precipitation but allowed for covariance between δd and δ18o values because baseflow samples lie along the diagonal lel the pre evaporation baseflow endmember was the projection of the baseflow value along the lel until it intersects the gmwl we used monte carlo sampling to combine uncertainty in baseflow and lel slope slope values between 3 8 and 4 1 the average and springtime slopes to find total uncertainty in the pre evaporated baseflow 3 3 3 uncertainty in volume weighted storm flow we modeled flow values as having gaussian error with standard deviation of 10 of the flow value as error bounds of 10 20 are typical for medium or high in bank flows mcmillan et al 2012 each sample was assumed to have isotope analysis uncertainty as above monte carlo sampling was used to combine the flow and isotope uncertainties for uncertainty in the volume weighted average 3 3 4 uncertainty in storm flow and groundwater source fractions to determine the combined impact of the uncertainties above we used monte carlo sampling similar to delsman et al 2013 for 10 000 replicates we drew random samples from the end members and target water distributions and used these values in emma calculation of water source fractions this gave a distribution of water source fractions from which we calculated the standard deviation as a measure of the source fraction uncertainty 4 results 4 1 end member mixing analysis 4 1 1 end member calculation endmembers considered as possible sources of stormflow for each event in the san diego river were precipitation post evaporation baseflow pre evaporation baseflow and imported water table 2 san diego precipitation varied isotopically among storm events depending on the source and direction of rainfall bearing air masses the differences among locations were small compared to differences between events fig 3 a two factor anova statistical test showed that between storm differences account for 99 of the total variation in isotopes based on this finding we recommend that event specific precipitation endmembers should be used but that the isotopic values from the three locations can be averaged to give a single end member the imported water endmember was determined by averaging the isotopic values of tap water at four locations sampled in summer 2018 as reported by biggs et al 2019 δ18o of 11 43 and δd of 93 5 which had minimal variation standard deviation 0 5 in δ18o compared with the difference between imported water and other endmembers the isotopic values are similar to colorado river water williams 1997 reflecting san diego s strong reliance on the colorado river for its water supply the baseflow endmember was calculated as an average of all samples taken from the mission valley section of the san diego river δ18o of 1 88 and δd of 23 6 baseflow samples collected were isotopically enriched and δ18o and δd values fell far from the gmwl indicating baseflow was heavily evaporated the lel was fitted to the baseflow samples giving a slope of 4 07 falling within the range of 3 5 4 8 for san diego gibson et al 2008 biggs et al 2019 calculated the lel for the san diego region using an alternative method that uses temperature and relative humidity data benettin et al 2018 this gave an average slope of 3 8 varying between a summer minimum of 3 5 and a spring maximum of 4 1 our regression slope was close to the upper bound and we used this springtime lel slope 4 07 in our analysis the average lel slope 3 8 was included during uncertainty analysis for comparison the lels were used to project baseflow values onto the gmwl giving similar pre evaporation baseflow values for springtime δ18o of 6 58 and δd of 42 8 and average δ18o of 6 18 and δd of 39 4 lels the same process was followed to give pre evaporation baseflow endmembers for alvarado creek with δ18o of 8 30 and δd of 56 4 and for murphy canyon with δ18o of 8 22 and δd of 55 8 endmembers were selected according to the procedure in section 3 2 1 all endmembers and reference lines for the sdr location are summarized in fig 4 4 2 storm component analysis 4 2 1 san diego river an overview of stormwater source fractions is given in fig 5 stormflow isotopic values typically fell between baseflow and pre evaporation baseflow with little input from precipitation or imported water the exception is the november 29th 2018 storm where stormflow was largely reflective of precipitation imported water input was insignificant except in one event where 8 9 came from imported water where precipitation was so small that discharge was more reflective of low flow than stormflow mixing diagrams are demonstrated in fig 6 for the storms of january 5th 2019 baseflow dominated and november 29th 2018 precipitation dominated mixing diagrams for the remaining storms are similar to fig 6a and are shown in the supplementary material fig s1 pre evaporation baseflow was the dominant source for 5 of the 8 storms 4 2 2 san diego river within storm isotopic variation we used hourly stormwater samples to investigate how water sources change during an event two examples are given in fig 7 which show the δ18o signatures superimposed on precipitation and streamflow values and the remaining events are shown in the supplementary material fig s2 fig 7a shows that the three earliest samples were similar to precipitation later in the storm isotope values moved towards the baseflow composition fig 7b shows that pre event values were reflective of post evaporation baseflow and moved towards the precipitation endmember as rain entered the river before returning to pre event values characteristic of a mix between baseflow and pre evaporation baseflow overall flow early in an event was dominated by precipitation suggesting a combination of direct precipitation into the riparian zone combined with runoff from impervious surfaces dominates early in the storm with in channel and subsurface sources dominating during peak discharge and the falling limb of the storm hydrograph note that although precipitation contributed strongly to the start of events the flow was then low compared to the peak of the event therefore when volume weighted sources of water were calculated for the whole event the precipitation contribution was negligible as demonstrated by the emma analysis fig 5 4 2 3 alvarado creek and murphy canyon tributaries in contrast to the mainstem stormflow in the alvarado creek and murphy canyon tributaries showed isotope composition close to the precipitation endmember see fig 8 a for an example in most events at alvarado creek there was not enough endmember separation for emma two storms did show enough separation march 15th 2018 stormflow consisted of 8 pre evaporation baseflow 16 baseflow and 77 precipitation while the january 17th 2019 stormflow consisted of 17 evaporated baseflow and 83 precipitation at murphy canyon the march 15th 2018 stormflow consisted of 27 pre evaporation baseflow and 73 precipitation and the january 17th 2019 stormflow consisted of 23 pre evaporation baseflow and 77 precipitation due to rounding numbers may not sum to 100 thus stormflow in both locations was primarily 70 85 attributed to precipitation input suggesting impervious runoff fig 8b shows all total precipitation stormflow and baseflow samples for alvarado creek with reference to the gmwl lel and imported water endmember murphy canyon showed a similar pattern not shown during individual events the isotopic composition of stormflow fell on the gmwl although not always adjacent to the precipitation endmember the fact that almost all stormwater samples fell close to gmwl suggests the majority of source water contributing to the stormflow in these tributaries had a direct precipitation origin 4 3 groundwater mixing analysis groundwater samples from wells in the mission valley groundwater basin were similar in composition to stormflow and fell along the mixing line of the pre evaporation baseflow and post evaporation baseflow endmembers from the san diego river emma results indicated that around 2 3rd of groundwater was composed of pre evaporation baseflow while 1 3rd was composed of post evaporation baseflow the percent of post evaporation baseflow ranged from 23 6 to 39 1 fig 11 because stormflow showed the same mixing between these two endmembers we were unable to separate recharge occurring during storms and recharge occurring from the infiltration of baseflow over longer time periods nevertheless post evaporation baseflow was contributing a substantial amount to both stormflow and groundwater groundwater composition was similar throughout the year fig 11 suggesting that recharge occurs over longer decadal timescales so that seasonal recharge is a small proportion of the total volume and does not create fluctuations in the groundwater isotopes groundwater composition showed slight spatial variations well db 2 a had 10 lower contribution from baseflow than the other wells fig 11 despite being within 15 m horizontally and 0 26 m screen depth from wells db 2 and db 2 b 4 4 uncertainty analysis 4 4 1 uncertainty in isotope analysis differences in isotope values between the sample pairs were calculated and used to fit normal distributions fig 9 the distribution means are not significantly different from zero as expected and the standard deviations are 0 21 for δ18o and 0 77 for δd these values are small compared to the range of δ18o and δd values sampled 4 4 2 uncertainty in end member definition uncertainties for each end member were found by combining the uncertainties in individual isotope samples flow values end members and lel slope for each storm monte carlo samples were taken from each distribution as illustrated in fig 10 for the 9 jan 18 storm event the largest uncertainties were in the rainfall and post evaporation baseflow end members the imported water endmember was important for only one storm and the variability in the isotopic signature of tap water was low 0 5 so we did not carry out monte carlo analysis for that endmember 4 4 3 uncertainty in stormwater and groundwater source fractions based on the uncertainty distributions for each end member we calculated the uncertainties in the source fractions table 3 while the uncertainties are typically 6 the storm of 11 mar 18 showed high uncertainty values 18 because precipitation and pre evaporation baseflow isotopes could not be distinguished excluding these outliers the average error expressed as a standard deviation was 4 9 or as 90 confidence bounds of 8 0 for example a storm that has 40 evaporated base flow would have 90 confidence bounds of 32 48 using the same method we calculated confidence bounds on the percentage of post evaporation baseflow in the each groundwater sample fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 what do isotope dynamics in san diego tell us about runoff and recharge processes in urban arid environments 5 1 1 seasonal annual timescales our results show that at a seasonal annual timescale new precipitation only provides a substantial volumetric contribution to runoff volume in the first event after the dry summer season during the wet winter season runoff is a mixture of post evaporation baseflow representative of shallow groundwater that has undergone evaporation after discharging into the river and was present in channel immediately prior to the storm event and pre evaporation baseflow representative of groundwater that has not interacted with the channel and only discharged to the stream during the storm event later in the wet season the post evaporation baseflow decreases and the pre evaporation baseflow increases indicating that heavily evaporated in channel sources had been flushed and that groundwater discharge to the stream dominates this groundwater discharge can be viewed as an indirect contribution with precipitation origin as it comprises return flow from a baseflow pool of precipitation that recharged the groundwater in previous storm events we interpret these results to imply that the amount of pre event water present in the stream during a storm is a function of hydrologic connectivity between the channel and water stored in the hillslope groundwater or surface ponds when connectivity is low following a dry summer little upstream surface water or groundwater will be discharged to the stream therefore stormflow from the first event of the winter season consists of precipitation and new runoff from impervious surfaces this finding is consistent with studies in non urban watersheds where dry antecedent conditions led to much greater percentages of new water james and roulet 2009 penna et al 2015 for subsequent events hydrologic connectivity is greater and stormflow consists largely of pre event surface and groundwater that is flushed from upstream as the winter progresses past the initial flush of pre event water the proportion of post evaporation baseflow declines and younger seasonal water predominates we present a conceptual model of water sources for the river and groundwater and their seasonal changes in fig 12 5 1 2 event time scales at an event time scale streamflow is diluted isotopically by precipitation during the early rising limb of the hydrograph subsequently streamflow is supplied by a mixture of pre and post evaporation baseflow as isotope values move back towards pre event signatures this pattern suggests that stormflow discharge includes groundwater return flow meriano et al 2011 similarly found that groundwater contributed 20 30 of flow volume during an urban storm event challenging the view that groundwater does not significantly contribute to urban stormflow we note that direct precipitation contribution to overall stormflow volume is negligible because higher flows later in the event are dominated by pre and post evaporation baseflow our results show that new precipitation influences the start of the hydrograph and contrast with previous studies that found pre event water dominates the start of the hydrograph with new water contributions lagging behind the hydrograph peak nolan and hill 1990 pellerin et al 2008 we hypothesize that the precipitation influence at the start of hydrograph is due to impervious contributions from the urban area the large contribution of in channel water and groundwater to stormflow in the mainstem sdr may be attributed in part to a large artificial ponds that store water in channel upstream of the sampling site and b the intact floodplain of the san diego river that maintains near channel sources of groundwater that can be mobilized during a storm event 5 1 3 tributary flows the alvarado creek and murphy canyon tributaries have very low flows during non storm periods typically less than 1 m3s 1 and so have little pre event water to contribute to stormflow neither tributary watershed has significant upstream ponding or in channel storage accordingly the isotopic results show that their stormflow is attributed to precipitation rather than old water that has been displaced and rapidly mobilized by precipitation as is typical in non urban environments the old water paradox kirchner 2003 buttle 1994 larger new precipitation contributions are expected in watersheds with higher percentages of impervious surface cover hasenmueller et al 2017 and the alvarado creek and murphy canyon tributaries follow that behaviour 5 2 what are the implications of isotopic results for sustainable groundwater management in san diego insight as to how the water enters an aquifer can inform management practices to improve water quality our results show that groundwater has an isotopic composition very similar to that of stormflow a mix of 1 3rd post evaporation baseflow and 2 3rds pre evaporation baseflow this similarity suggests close surface subsurface connection and water movement between streamflow and groundwater implying that efforts to improve groundwater quality must include improving and sustaining surface water quality further evidence for connection between streamflow and groundwater comes from significant total coliform levels detected in one of the groundwater wells up to 2400 mpn 100 ml thought to originate from the river to provide additional evidence future studies could consider monitoring river water for geochemical composition over time for comparison with groundwater samples one target for water quality improvement measures should be the post evaporation baseflow i e river water that has been present as surface water long enough to undergo evaporation this water composes 1 3rd of groundwater with this recharge hypothesized to occur from the river channel either gradually during low flow periods or during storm periods when this water is re mobilized from slow moving reaches of the river a second target for water quality improvement should be the first flush storm event of the winter this event transports unusually high levels of new precipitation direct to the river and water quality is typically poor due to the flushing of summer buildup of trash microbes and other pollutants ahn et al 2005 jiang et al 2001 digiacomo et al 2004 research into urban stormwater management is scarce for arid regions and for locations where stormwater interacts with groundwater jefferson et al 2017 regier et al 2020 the impact of urbanization and stormwater mitigation techniques on the hydrologic budget is still an open research question wenger et al 2009 however information on the recharge sources above can be used to evaluate possible management strategies for example for the first flush event riparian wetlands help prevent overland flow from reaching the channel gremillion et al 2000 for the channel unlined urban channels show lower event water contributions than cement lined channels hasenmueller and robinson 2016 both alvarado creek and murphy canyon are partially cement lined restoration projects under consideration for these streams promote unlined areas given the high percentage of event rainfall water present in these creeks they provide a promising target for water quality improvement as small urban tributaries can be a major source of water quality contaminants to their downstream rivers aleksander kwaterczak and plenzler 2019 5 3 what is the impact of end member complexity on urban tracer studies our results demonstrate the challenges of using isotopic mixing analysis in urban environments that typically have high spatial and temporal variation in flow pathways and therefore isotopic concentrations yu et al 2019 follstad shah et al 2019 in a study by bazemore et al 1994 spatial variation in endmembers was the most significant source of uncertainty in event water source fractions which reached 20 our study showed high temporal variability in isotopes due to a pulse of fast runoff of new precipitation followed by contributions from groundwater and remobilized pre event surface water one consequence of isotopic variability is that streamflow samples may fall outside the emma mixing triangle of potential end members due to missing or un representative endmembers vázquez suñé et al 2010 we observed this pattern in alvarado creek and murphy canyon and several explanations are possible first similarly to bonneau et al 2018 we found that baseflow isotopes showed significant variation so the average baseflow endmember may not be representative for a particular event second the temporal variability in isotopic values that we found in rainfall not shown due to short term amount effects i e an inverse relationship between rainfall intensity and isotopic value mook and rozanski 2000 might lead to a rainfall endmember that changes during a storm event lastly unmeasured channel inflows e g sewer or storm drain overflow mendoza et al 2020 could introduce an unknown endmember to create sampling protocols that are robust to the urban environment several changes are recommended the examples above explain the high uncertainties that we found in precipitation and baseflow endmembers therefore isotopic studies in urban environments will benefit from higher temporal resolution sampling of these endmembers to reduce the uncertainties in source fractions for stormflow and groundwater for example baseflow could be sampled immediately prior to each event to provide an event specific endmember additional cumulative rainfall samples throughout the watersheds would be valuable as oceanic and continental air masses mix over san diego farlin et al 2013 better specification of tributary endmembers will be particularly useful as their fast runoff is a probable source of pollutants into the river and eventually into the groundwater basin 6 conclusion in the san diego river and mission valley groundwater basin we sampled rainfall stormflow groundwater baseflow and calculated pre evaporation baseflow as an additional endmember stormflow and groundwater had very similar isotopic compositions in the mainstem stormwater was on average composed of 28 post evaporation baseflow and 69 pre evaporation baseflow with minimal direct contributions from rainfall or imported water groundwater samples were composed of 32 post evaporation baseflow and 68 pre evaporation baseflow we conclude that the river and groundwater systems are tightly connected stormflow consists largely of pre event surface water and groundwater return flow that is flushed from upstream mixing with existing baseflow we hypothesize that the dominance of pre event water is due to significant in channel storage and an intact floodplain the exception was for the first event after the summer season which was composed of 85 new precipitation implying that dry conditions prevent connectivity and lead to overland flow as the primary runoff generation mechanism tributary flows by contrast were composed of primarily 75 of new precipitation deriving from fast runoff of new water as is typical of urban stormflow this reflects a lack of in channel sources disconnection from the floodplain and higher impervious surface coverage in the main san diego river hourly samples did show limited impact of new precipitation in the rising limb however this influence was not sufficient to substantially impact the overall stormflow composition the source fractions have 90 confidence bounds of 8 0 the largest uncertainty sources are in the rainfall and post evaporation baseflow endmembers these endmembers are assumed isotopically constant but measurements showed variation over space rainfall and time both rainfall and baseflow the study confirmed previous findings that urban baseflow isotopes vary substantially over time we therefore recommend higher resolution baseflow sampling to reduce uncertainty for isotopic mixing analysis in urban areas overall our results show that isotopic sampling is valuable for analysis of groundwater and stormflow sources in urban environments our findings made it possible to recommend management interventions to improve surface water and groundwater quality and therefore promote use of urban groundwater as a water resource credit authorship

8274,study region lower apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf river basin southeastern united states u s study focus excessive groundwater withdrawal for irrigation from the upper floridan aquifer is an important issue in the lower acf river basin as it has led to decline in groundwater levels as well as reduction in baseflows since the withdrawal is projected to further increase in the future this study evaluated the impacts of the projected increase in irrigation on the groundwater levels as well as the stream aquifer flux in the region the study also identified regions that are most important for groundwater recharge new hydrological insights into the region evaluation of the geohydrologic zones identified upland instream karst as the most sensitive zone for recharge into the aquifer while zones in the region where the aquifer thickness was comparatively lower and close to the land surface was generally identified as sensitive simulation of the projected irrigation scenario predicted a reduction in groundwater levels by as much as 2 38 m while a general reduction was predicted in much of the model domain large groundwater level reductions were mostly predicted in regions where the aquifer is comparatively thinner evaluation of the changes in stream aquifer flux showed that flux reduced by as much as 33 with large reductions predicted in the lower flint and kinchafoonee watersheds this study also helped identify localized zones and stream sections most susceptible to the impacts of increase in irrigation keywords modflow lower acf river basin groundwater irrigation groundwater surface water interaction upper floridan aquifer 1 introduction groundwater resources play a critical role in the agricultural and ecological vitality of the lower apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf river basin in south georgia united states u s the upper floridan aquifer ufa that underlies the river basin fig 1 is one of the most productive aquifer systems in the world and is the primary source of water for agricultural industrial and municipal use in the region torak and painter 2006 it plays a critical role in the agricultural economy of the region that generates more than 2 billion in farm based revenue annually wolfe and stubbs 2014 as it supplies about 80 of the total irrigation demand for irrigating more than 200 000 ha of agricultural land through more than 4 000 irrigation wells painter et al 2015 torak and painter 2006 the ufa supplied an estimated 1 7 million cubic meters of water for irrigation in 2015 ga epd 2017 but withdrawals from the ufa can be as high as 3 6 million cubic meters during drought years couch and mcdowell 2006 jones et al 2017 as the ufa is karstic in nature and close to the land surface the region is characterized by sinkhole ponds karst sinks incised streambeds and conduits that exposes the limestone to the surface characteristics typical to a karstic topography this has created a direct hydraulic connection of the underlying aquifer system with the surficial rivers and lake systems throughout much of the lower acf river basin torak and painter 2006 as a result the ufa is an important contributor to streamflow in many of the surficial streams contributing tens of million cubic meters of water every day as baseflow torak and painter 2006 intense groundwater withdrawals for irrigation however has led to a decline in groundwater levels and has also resulted in the reduction of baseflow to the streams in the lower acf river basin jones and torak 2006 singh et al 2016 2017 the region has witnessed an increase in no flow and low flow periods in many perennial streams singh et al 2016 the situation is further exacerbated by the recurring drought conditions in the region including those that occurred in 1985 1989 1999 2002 2010 2012 and 2016 pumpage induced groundwater level fluctuations of nearly 10 m were observed during multiple severe droughts in the last two decades with a record or near record low groundwater levels in most wells gordon et al 2012 torak and painter 2006 flows in the spring fed streams in the region also decreased by 50 100 during drought periods gwc 2017 the recurring drought conditions along with agriculture intensification in the lower acf have threatened the already limited groundwater resources as well as the future of the agricultural economy in the region along with agriculture the increasing low flow and no flow stream conditions have severely affected the endangered and threated species of freshwater mussels in the lower acf river basin gagnon et al 2004 golladay et al 2004 shea et al 2013 declining downstream flow as a result of reduced baseflow conditions in the lower acf river basin especially during drought periods has also impacted freshwater inflow into the downstream apalachicola bay as well as reservoir operatios and led to the tri state water wars since the 1980s between the neighboring states of alabama georgia and florida gilbert and turner nesmith 2019 sel center 2015 the georgia water planning and policy center gwpcc prepared a detailed agricultural water demand forecast for the whole of georgia for 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 at the county and or drainage area level using economic models to predict a future increase in irrigated acreages the study which made separate projections for surface and groundwater sources as well as for a range of weather conditions projects the groundwater demand for agricultural irrigation in the lower acf river basin to further increase from 2015 to 2050 during dry years by 16 lower flint ochlockonee regional water planning council 2017 it is of paramount importance to understand the spatial and temporal impacts of this projected increase in groundwater withdrawal from the ufa on groundwater levels and stream aquifer interaction especially in drought years to determine if the ufa can sustain this increased withdrawal to maintain agricultural productivity without adversely affecting the surface and groundwater resources of the region adverse impact of groundwater over exploitation in the region has led to numerous studies to evaluate the spatio temporal impacts of groundwater use on the groundwater levels and surface and groundwater interaction jones and torak 2006 developed a finite element groundwater model and evaluated the impacts of seasonal groundwater pumpage for irrigation in drought conditions including a comprehensive water budget for the ufa mitra et al 2016 utilized the model developed by jones and torak 2006 and simulated the transient drought conditions from 2010 to 2012 to evaluate its impact on the groundwater levels and the groundwater budget of the region they also assessed the impacts of irrigation during drought conditions the modular finite element model modfe torak 1993 used by jones and torak 2006 was calibrated under steady state conditions while mitra et al 2016 validated the model utilizing data from a single month singh et al 2017 identified critical streams and tributaries that were adversely affected by irrigation pumping using principal component and k means clustering analysis and evaluated the effectiveness of water restriction scenarios on the stream aquifer flux jones et al 2017 developed a usgs modular finite difference groundwater flow model modflow harbaugh 2005 that was calibrated for transient conditions for groundwater levels and baseflow for the ufa and the overlying semi confining unit to evaluate the hydrologic budget for the 2008 2012 drought baseflow calibration for the model was performed for only a limited area in the model domain these studies however have mostly focused on evaluating the drought impacts under current groundwater withdrawals for irrigation and there has been limited study evaluating the impacts of increasing irrigation in the region although mitra et al 2019 evaluated the sensitivity of groundwater levels to increase in irrigation in the region the simulated increase was a constant increase of the 2011 groundwater pumpage values over the entire model domain this increase might not accurately reflect the changes in the spatial distribution as well as the increase in irrigation due to increasing agricultural lands that are better accounted for in the gwpcc projections simulating the gwpcc scenario can help us get a more accurate understanding of the potential impacts of increase in irrigation understanding the change in groundwater levels as well as the quantitative interactions between the ufa and the surface streams in different parts of the study region under projected water withdrawal scenario can help identify the regions and stream reaches that are most vulnerable this information can be critical for developing long term agricultural and environmental sustainability plan for the region failure to protect aquatic habitat due to low flow conditions in surface streams of this region because of unsustainable withdrawals from ufa can potentially lead to water use restrictions which can negatively affect agricultural productivity and rural communities of the region understanding the changes in stream aquifer flux due to the projected withdrawals in drought years can also help water managers to avoid potential conflict amongst the water users of this region hence the main goal of this study was to simulate and evaluate the impacts of the projected increase in irrigation in the groundwater levels and stream aquifer interaction in the region using modflow this study also adds to the previous modeling efforts in the region by developing a two layered three dimensional groundwater model for the ufa in the lower acf river basin using modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 that is calibrated for transient conditions for groundwater level and stream aquifer flux baseflow discharge from aquifer for both wet and dry years and throughout the model domain the study also identified sensitive recharge zones within the model domain for groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux which to the authors knowledge has not been evaluated for the region specifically the three main objectives of this paper were to i develop a three dimensional calibrated groundwater flow model for the ufa in the lower acf using the usgs modflow nwt ii identify critical zones for groundwater recharge sensitive to groundwater levels and flow and iii simulate projected irrigation scenario and quantify the effects of the projected withdrawals on the ufa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and geohydrology of the ufa the focus area for this research is the ufa in the agriculturally intensive region of the lower acf river basin hence the modeled region includes parts of south georgia southeastern alabama and northwestern florida of southeastern u s and is approximately 12 000 km2 in area fig 2 a forests and agricultural land are the dominant land cover and land use types in the study area covering about 46 and 39 respectively while urban area accounts for only about 6 of the total area homer et al 2020 longleaf pine pinus taeda is the dominant forest species ruefenacht et al 2008 while cotton peanut and corn are the major row corps produced in the region the climate of the region is humid subtropical characterized by long hot and humid summers and mild winters average temperature ranges from about 17 in the winter to about 33 7 in the summer arguez et al 2012 but temperatures above 37 7 100 are common in the summer precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year and averages annually about 1365 mm in the south to about 1161 mm in the north of the study area arguez et al 2012 precipitation in the winter however accounts for almost all of the areal recharge to the ufa as the frontal low intensity and long duration rainfall along with low evapotranspiration is conducive to recharge summer precipitation events are convective with high intensity and short duration resulting in more surface runoff land elevation of the study region ranges from about 148 m in the northeastern boundary of the study area to about 11 m in the southern boundary fig 2a agriculture accounts for the highest water use in the area of which more than 80 is supplied by the ufa rugel et al 2012 groundwater withdrawals for irrigation have steadily increased in the lower acf river basin since the 1970s with the expansion of center pivot irrigation systems gwc 2017 groundwater irrigation increased by 59 from 2005 to 2010 while surface water irrigation decreased during the same time period lawrence 2016 the modeled area lies in the coastal plain physiographic province and consists mostly of a low lying karstic region called the dougherty plain physiographic district torak and painter 2006 the dougherty plain is characterized by relatively flat inner lowland containing sub surface and internal drainage and heterogeneous stream development typical to a karst topography torak and painter 2006 the ufa in most of the modeling domain consists of the ocala limestone of the eocene period with locally variable hydraulic conductivity that ranges from less than 21 m day to more than 150 m day over the region torak and painter 2006 overlying the ufa is the discontinuous undifferentiated overburden weathered residuum and undifferentiated surficial deposits that may contain water bearing zones and are together referred to as the upper semi confining unit uscu regions where the uscu is absent or thin or where the ufa outcrops to the surface are sources for direct recharge to the aquifer the aquifer also receives recharge through the uscu as vertical leakage of water torak and painter 2006 major rivers and streams have cut shallow channels through the uscu to the underlying ufa that is close to the land surface resulting in a direct connection between the ufa and the rivers and streams that flow through the area the ufa outcrops in the northwestern boundary of the study domain and dips towards the southeast with the thickness of the aquifer ranging from about 9 m in the outcrop area to more than 200 m in the southern end of the modeling domain torak and painter 2006 williams and kuniansky 2016 fig 2b groundwater levels in the ufa fluctuate seasonally with yearly maximum from late winter to early spring due to increased recharge as well as reduced evapotranspiration et and agricultural demand yearly minimums are often observed in mid to late fall due to increased water use for irrigation reduced recharge and higher et demand during the summer months torak and painter 2006 the modeling domain and the geohydrologic setting for the domain are based on the area described by torak and painter 2006 which describes in detail the groundwater flow and geohydrology of the ufa and the overlying and underlying units in the study region and are referred to for further detail 2 2 modflow nwt modflow is a block centered finite difference groundwater model developed by the usgs that can be utilized for two or three dimensional applications in solving groundwater flow problems modflow uses a modular structure that allows for each boundary condition option to be independent of each other and allows for adding or removing of options harbaugh 2005 the groundwater flow model for this study was developed using modflow nwt a newton formulation of modflow 2005 niswonger et al 2011 modflow nwt is a standalone version that must be used with the upstream weighting package upw it expands on the capacity of modflow 2005 to solve the problem of constant drying and rewetting non linearities when simulating unconfined systems that can lead to the issue of model instability and non convergence when using other versions of modflow hunt and feinstein 2012 niswonger et al 2011 although the karstic system of the ufa could have the presence of conduit and fractured flow and the use of an equivalent porous media model could probably not represent the system very accurately previous groundwater modeling studies successfully modeled the region while excluding the representation of any local conduit flows that might be present jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 kuniansky 2016 also showed that an equivalent porous media model without representation of local conduit flows can adequately simulate the groundwater levels of a karstic system and hence was used in this research the governing equation for each cell in modflow for groundwater flow is based on the continuity equation and is expressed as harbaugh 2005 1 q i s s δ h δ t δ v where q i is the flow rate into the cell l3t 1 s s is the specific storage l 1 δ v is the volume of the cell l3 δ h is the change in the head l and δ t is the time interval t 2 3 conceptual model development the conceptual flow model for the ufa in the lower acf river basin is based on the geohydrologic study of torak and painter 2006 of the region and similar to the model developed by jones and torak 2006 and jones et al 2017 groundwater recharge from precipitation as vertical leakage from the overlying uscu where present and as direct recharge where it is thin or absent are the biggest source of groundwater flow into the system the northwestern boundary where the ufa outcrops is considered the saturated updip limit of the aquifer and the regional groundwater flow occurs from the northwest to southeast as the ufa downdips in that direction groundwater level in the updip area of the ufa fluctuates very little throughout the year the regional outflow of groundwater occurs from the south and southeastern boundary based on the potentiometric maps of the ufa gordon and peck 2010 kinnaman and dixon 2011 the biggest outflow from the ufa is to the rivers and streams in the region as the aquifer and the surficial streams are in direct connection throughout the region groundwater pumpage is another important source of outflow from the aquifer which peaks during june july of the growing season when the irrigation demand is at the highest level lake seminole and lake blackshear which are actively managed reservoirs within the model domain are maintained at or near constant levels throughout the year and impact the local groundwater levels underlying the ufa is an impermeable layer known as the lisbon formation that acts as the lower confining unit to the aquifer 2 4 numerical model development a three dimensional groundwater flow model was developed using modflow nwt based on the conceptualization of the flow system for the modeled region which is defined by the following partial differential equation harbaugh 2005 2 x k x x h d x y k y y h d y x k z z h d z w s s h t where k x x k y y a n d k z z are values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h is the potentiometric head l w is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and sinks t 1 s s is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 and t is time t data pre processing and post processing for preparing the model inputs for the modflow nwt was performed using modelmuse a graphical user interface developed by usgs winston 2009 2 4 1 model discretization a two layered groundwater model with a uniform grid size of 750m 750m was developed that represented the uscu and the ufa fig 3 the model has 282 rows and 102 columns resulting in a total of 28 764 grid cells of which 21 394 are active the bottom elevation of the ufa was combined with the thickness of the ufa both acquired from williams and dixon 2015 to determine the top of the ufa a digital elevation model dem of the land surface was then acquired from usgs gesch et al 2002 to determine the thickness and the top of the uscu manual adjustments had to be made for grid cells that resulted in having the top of the ufa higher than the top of the uscu using the two datasets a transient model was built from 2007 to 2013 with monthly stress periods and daily time steps this allowed for comparison between model simulated groundwater level with observed daily groundwater levels rather than comparing with monthly averages thus giving better confidence in the model performance initial hydraulic conductivity for the ufa and uscu as well as the specific yield and specific storage information for model setup were derived from the previous studies in the region which were then adjusted during model calibration jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 2 4 2 boundary conditions the base of the ufa was simulated as a no flow boundary as the lower confining unit below the ufa acts as an impermeable layer the updip limit of the ufa in the northwestern boundary of the model was simulated as a specified head boundary condition anderson et al 2015 fig 3 using the time variant specified head package chd as there was a minimal fluctuation in the groundwater head throughout the year the remaining of the regional boundary of the model was simulated as a general head dependent boundary ghb condition anderson et al 2015 using the ghb package fig 3 two lakes in the model domain were also simulated using the ghb package and lake level elevations were provided for each stress period fig 3 groundwater head for the regional chd and ghb boundaries were provided by averaging the potentiometric heads from gordon and peck 2010 and kinnaman and dixon 2011 and kept constant throughout the simulation for model simplicity groundwater pumpage was an important boundary condition that needed to be estimated accurately for input in the model monthly groundwater withdrawal estimates from the ufa were acquired from the georgia environmental protection division epd at hydrologic unit code huc 12 level which was then divided equally to each well within the huc 12 watershed fig 4 groundwater pumpage was simulated as a specified flux package anderson et al 2015 using the well package wel ephemeral streams that had the possibility of going dry were simulated using the drain package drn while the perennial streams were simulated using the river package riv fig 3 streambed depth for the drn and riv packages were acquired from previous studies performed in the region jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 initial values for streambed conductance were also acquired from the previous studies which were then calibrated during the model calibration period stream elevation for the riv package was estimated by interpolating stream stages from usgs stations with continuous observed data for the simulation period and the lake levels from the two lakes areal recharge from precipitation is a very important boundary condition in the model as it has the greatest influence in the groundwater budget but is also the most difficult to estimate healy 2010 groundwater recharge can vary greatly spatially and temporally as it is influenced by the variation in land use vegetation geohydrologic conditions climate and land management practices among others healy 2010 sophocleous 2005 groundwater recharge for this study was estimated using a physically based semi distributed watershed scale continuous simulation water balance based model called the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 swat accounts for the spatial and temporal variability in recharge as it maintains the spatial heterogeneity of a watershed by dividing it into sub watersheds and each sub watershed is further divided into hydrologic response units hrus which are the basic units for calculation many studies have successfully used swat to estimate groundwater recharge gyamfi et al 2017 lee et al 2019 raposo et al 2013 a swat model was developed for the study region fig 5 that incorporated the major land use types and agricultural crop rotations the model was then calibrated and validated for streamflow for 5 usgs streamflow stations within the watershed table 1 fig 5 after which groundwater recharge estimates were acquired for each sub watershed and incorporated into the modflow as a specified flux anderson et al 2015 using the recharge package rch fig 6 the developed swat model had a total of 160 sub watersheds of which 89 were partially or completely located within the groundwater model domain fig 5 and used for estimating groundwater recharge 2 5 model calibration model calibration was a two step process and involved matching simulated groundwater levels to observed levels followed by matching model simulated stream aquifer flux to its observed counterpart for the 2007 2013 period observed groundwater levels and streamflow data used for model calibration were acquired from the usgs national water information system nwis usgs 2019 2 360 daily groundwater observation data of the ufa were acquired from 359 wells in the model domain lack of observed groundwater observation data in the overlying uscu limited us to calibrating the groundwater head only for the ufa model performance evaluation for simulating groundwater head was performed by calculating the root mean square rms of the groundwater head residual which can be calculated as 3 r m s 1 n i 1 n h i s i m h i o b s 2 1 2 where n is the number of residuals h i s i m is the simulated head l and h i o b s l is the observed head along with rms a value of less than 0 1 for the ratio of the standard deviation of residuals std divided by the range r of observed groundwater levels also indicates a good model fit kuniansky et al 2004 and was also used for evaluation along with the statistical measures graphical measures including the plot of the frequency histogram of residuals and spatial distribution of residuals were also used for evaluating model performance calibration of stream aquifer flux was performed by comparing the simulated flux to monthly averaged estimated flux for a reach section which was estimated by subtracting the baseflow at the upstream from the downstream end of a reach a positive flux indicates a gaining stream and that the aquifer contributed water to streamflow in the reach section while a negative flux indicates a losing stream and that the stream lost water in that section as there are uncertainties associated with streamflow the estimation of baseflow and the resulting estimated observed flux for a reach section a target range of flux was calculated for each reach section to aid in calibration following the procedure similar to utilized by jones and torak 2006 the error factors ef of 10 0 10 and 5 0 05 were applied to reach sections having average streamflow less than and greater than 7 07 m3 s respectively jones and torak 2006 although measurement errors can be larger in reach sections with high flows the percent error can be higher in reach sections with smaller flows due to which a higher ef was used for reach section with smaller flows the target range was calculated as follows 4 f l o w m i n q d e f q d q u e f q u 5 f l o w m a x q d e f q d q u e f q u where f l o w m i n is the minimum target flow f l o w m a x is the maximum target flow q d is the downstream flow q u is the upstream flow and e f is the error factor daily baseflow estimates for calculating the target range fluxes were acquired using the usgs groundwater toolbox barlow et al 2015 the model was calibrated for stream aquifer flux for 6 reach sections reach 2 3 4 5 6 and 8 fig 7 as the lower flint river basin region was the major focus of the study stream reaches in and contributing to the lower flint were calibrated for stream aquifer flux in this study fig 7 also shows the upstream and downstream usgs stations that were used to estimate the target flux range for each reach section model calibration was performed by adjusting the hydraulic conductivity of the ufa streambed conductance for the riv and drn packages and specific storage values using automated and manual calibraiton approaches the model domain was divided into 14 hydraulic conductivity zones for the ufa 10 drn zones and 15 riv zones for calibration purposes ucode an inverse modeling tool for model calibration poeter and hill 1999 1998 was used to identify the sensitive hydraulic conductivity zones and river sections and perform initial automated calibration runs after which the model was calibrated manually for further refinement a sensitivity analysis was also performed by dividing the rch boundary condition into zones to identify critical groundwater recharge areas within the model domain that were sensitive and critical for groundwater level and flow this can potentially help decision makers identify target zones for land management for potentially improving groundwater recharge although it is ideally desired for hydrological models to be validated for an independent time period after calibration limited observed datasets for setting up the boundary conditions as well as model parameterization often limit groundwater models to only calibration jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 wang et al 2008 xue et al 2018 the groundwater model for this study was developed from only 2007 2013 due to the limited availability of groundwater irrigation data as the simulation period was limited but included extreme drought as well as wet conditions fig 6 a concerted effort was made to calibrate the model for the total simulation period rather than dividing between calibration and validation periods so that the model can be adequately parameterized for a range of climatic conditions calibration of multiple hydrologic variables as well as comprehensive evaluation of groundwater budget components after model calibration gives adequate confidence in simulated model results 2 6 irrigation scenario evaluating the spatio temporal impacts in the groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux due to fine resolution projected increase in groundwater irrigation scenario at huc 12 level can provide important information that can be critical for developing management plans for the long term sustainability agricultural productivity and protecting the ecological habitat of the ufa and the lower acf river basin gwpcc estimated agricultural water demand for the years 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 for dry wet and normal climate conditions to include the potential climate extremes of the irrigation scenarios the 75th percentile value which represents dry conditions with higher irrigation demands is used by gwpcc for planning purposes lower flint ochlockonee regional water planning council 2017 hence the irrigation scenario in this study was also evaluated for the 75th percentile evaluation of the 75th percentile groundwater irrigation water use scenario from 2020 to 2050 for each month showed a similar increasing trend in irrigation demand from 2020 to 2050 fig 8 a hence only the 2040 75th percentile irrigation scenario was selected for evaluation in this study scenario analysis was performed by replacing the irrigation demand of the year 2011 which was a dry year with the 2040 75th percentile irrigation demand herein from referred to as the scenario model run and comparing it to groundwater levels and stream flux values obtained from the calibrated model run to estimate the impacts of the projected increase in agricultural irrigation demand in a dry year fig 8b this also allowed us to evaluate the aquifer rebound potential and long term impact by comparing the calibrated and scenario model results till 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater level calibration as the model was calibrated only for transient conditions from 2007 to 2013 a model warm up was performed by replicating the stress periods of the first year of simulation for four years replication of the stress period for four years allowed for adequate model warm up without the loss of observed data that can be used for model calibration comparison between the 2 370 observed groundwater levels and its corresponding simulated values for the simulation period of 2007 2013 using a scatter plot fig 9 a shows that simulated groundwater levels from the calibrated model closely matched the observed groundwater levels in the ufa rms of groundwater head residual for the simulation period was 2 68 m which was close to the rms values in the previous modeling studies in the area jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 mitra et al 2016 jones and torak 2006 have stated that a simulation error of less than 2 8 m can be considered acceptable after accounting for the uncertainties and potential error in the aquifer geometry and groundwater level measurement the calculated ratio of std r was 0 03 which was less than 0 1 indicating a good model fit frequency histogram fig 9b and cumulative distribution plot fig 9c of the residuals showed that more than 80 of the residuals were less than 3 m and more than 92 of the residuals were less than 4 5 m the histogram also shows no skewness in the simulation of the groundwater level indicating that the model generally did not over or under simulate the groundwater levels evaluation and plotting of the mean groundwater head residual for each groundwater well showed that the model was also able to adequately simulate the spatial variability of groundwater levels in the model domain as shown by the random distribution of residuals fig 10 rms of the groundwater residuals was also calculated for each month in the simulation period to evaluate the groundwater model for simulating the temporal variation of the groundwater head rms of less than 2 86 m in 65 of the 83 months and less than 4 m in 79 of the 83 months fig 11 demonstrated that the model was also able to adequately simulate the temporal variability in the groundwater level of the ufa in the model domain overall groundwater calibration results showed that the model can adequately simulate groundwater levels in the ufa both temporally and spatially the model also performed adequately for dry as well as wet climate conditions as the calibration period included both dry 2011 2012 and wet periods 2008 2010 3 2 groundwater flux calibration calibration of stream aquifer flux along with groundwater levels in the model is critical for increasing model robustness and confidence in the simulation results as calibration of multiple variables helps constrain the model parameters better simulated stream aquifer flux and the target flux range for each reach section estimated based on the flow difference between the upstream and downstream end of the reach and the ef are presented in fig 12 stream aquifer flux for each section was calibrated by adjusting the streambed conductance it is important to note that reach 3 and 4 are along the tributary streams to the flint river where the aquifer is also relatively while the remaining four reach sections are along the main stem of the flint river where the aquifer is comparitavely thicker estimated baseflow derived from observed streamflow as a result are smaller for the two reach sections resulting in much smaller target flux range than the other reach sections this also indicates to a smaller baseflow contribution from the ufa for the two reach sections when compared to the other reach sections comparison between the simulated and target flux for all reach sections demonstrated that the model does an adequate job of simulating stream aquifer fluxes as most of the simulated fluxes are within or close to the target range for much of the simulation the model is however not able to capture the high flux estimates for oct 2010 april 2011 in reach 2 fig 12a and 3 fig 12b where the estimated target flux is much higher than the rest of the simulation period this could potentially have resulted because of the inability of the baseflow filter program to estimate accurate baseflow because of increased surface runoff and potentially sub surface later runoff during this high flow period the model was also able to capture the temporal variability in stream aquifer flux for all reach sections except for reach 2 the smallest reach section calibrated in the model was reach 4 and also the only section that had negative flux for most of the time period indicating that the reach was behaving as a losing reach for much of the simulation period and consistently during the drought periods of 2011 2012 simulation of stream aquifer flux was much better for reaches 5 6 and 8 fig 12d e and f which were along the main stem of the flint river in the lower flint river basin and had a direct connection to the aquifer section that was much deeper overall the flux calibration result shows that the calibrated model can adequately simulate and capture the temporal and spatial variability of stream aquifer flux for the stream reaches in the lower flint and adjoining reaches the model was however able to estimate stream aquifer flux better at reach sections that were in the region where the aquifer was thicker and had less variability in groundwater levels 3 3 groundwater budget groundwater budget evaluation provides critical information about the important groundwater components of the region and the impact on different components with a change in boundary conditions such as recharge and groundwater pumpage evaluation of net flux inflow outflow for each boundary condition for the whole simulation period showed that recharge rch was the biggest source of groundwater inflow and averaged about 8 500 megaliters per day mld with a minimal contribution also from the outcrop area chd averaging about 1 100 mld fig 13 perennial rivers riv accounted for the biggest outflow from the model domain about 6 300 mld fig 13 showing evidence to the fact that the ufa is an important contributor to streamflow in the region groundwater wells wel and ephemeral streams drn averaged less than 1 000 mgd of outflow while there was also a net outflow from the remaining regional boundary and lakes gbh at slightly higher than 1 000 mld fig 13 as the groundwater levels in the ufa follow a distinct pattern of seasonality monthly groundwater budget evaluation for the model was also performed fig 14 to evaluate its impact on the groundwater components as most groundwater recharge occurs in the winter months december march the groundwater level of the aquifer system is normally highest in the spring april may groundwater outflow to perennial rivers and ephemeral streams as a result is biggest during this time of the year which gradually decreases with summer and fall as there is a gradual decrease in groundwater level due to minimal recharge and increased groundwater pumpage for irrigation fig 14 the years 2011 and 2012 were drought years and the monthly groundwater budget of the two years clearly show the impact on the stream aquifer flux with reduced outflow to rivers due to drought conditions february 2013 which was preceded by prolonged drought was the only month during the whole simulation period that had a net positive flux for the river outflow riv indicating a net inflow of water from the rivers to the aquifer and demonstrates the negative impact drought can have in the region fig 14 the river flux returns to normality with higher than normal recharge in 2013 this exhibits the potential of the aquifer system in the region and the river flux to rebound quickly to normal levels after drought conditions but also demonstrates the vulnerability of the stream aquifer flux and streamflow in the region to prolonged drought that can be exacerbated by increased groundwater pumpage demand and withdrawal for irrigation during such periods 3 4 groundwater recharge critical zones the uscu was divided into 15 geohydrologic zones by torak and painter 2006 based on the hydrologic and geologic setting and the potential for recharge to the ufa fig 15 a scarcity of groundwater wells in the uscu makes it difficult for evaluating the recharge potential and sensitivity of the geohydrologic zones for recharge into the ufa hence monthly recharge estimates obtained from the swat model were divided into 15 recharge zones in the rch package based on the geohydrologic zones and sensitivity analysis was performed using ucode to determine the sensitivity of each zone to simulating groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux fig 15a and b present the 15 geohydrologic zones and the composite scaled sensitivity css for the 15 zones respectively css in ucode indicates the sensitivity of the parameter to the observed values for estimating the parameter value accurately with higher values indicating higher sensitivity results showed that zone 11 upland interstream karst was the most sensitive recharge zone followed by zones 10 4 3 6 12 and 7 upland instream instream karst swamp instream karst upland outcrop and solution escarpment torak and painter 2006 recharge zones were mostly sensitive in the region where the ufa is comparatively thinner and close to the land surface where groundwater recharge can reach to the ufa quickly and can create substantial variations in the groundwater level identification of the sensitive recharge zones can provide potential information in identifying the critical recharge zones that are most sensitive to groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux it should be however noted that sensitivity analysis results are dependent on the observations provided and although a concerted effort was made to include observations that were distributed temporally and spatially lack of observations in some zones e g zone 5 and zone 9 could have biased the sensitivity analysis results 3 5 impact of projected increase in irrigation demand groundwater levels from the scenario model run in which the january to december 2011 irrigation data was replaced with the 2040 projected irrigation were compared against the calibrated model run for four time periods to study the short first day of september 2011 and december 2011 and long term first day of march 2012 and december 2013 impacts of the projected increase in irrigation fig 16 evaluation of change in groundwater levels towards the end of the growing season fig 16a showed that the groundwater levels would have further decreased by more than 1 m in many parts of the ufa and by as much as 2 38 m in the lower flint river basin as compared to the groundwater levels of 2011 for that time period large groundwater level decrease was mostly predicted in regions where the aquifer is comparatively thinner in the lower flint and the adjoining kinchafoonee ichawaynochaway and spring huc 8 watersheds but there was some groundwater level decrease predicted throughout most of the aquifer assessment of the groundwater level in december 2011 fig 16b and march 2012 fig 16c showed gradual rebounding of the aquifer levels although groundwater levels were still lower by half a meter in many places the aquifer was not able to fully recover to the groundwater levels of december 2013 fig 16d even after the higher than normal recharge fig 6 in 2013 comparison of simulated stream aquifer flux river outflow from the aquifer between the calibrated and scenario model run from 2011 to 2013 fig 17 also showed a reduction in stream aquifer flux in all the evaluated reach sections because of the increase in irrigation and the subsequent reduction in groundwater levels fig 17 reach 2 and 8 which are in the kinchafoonee and lower flint watersheds respectively saw the biggest relative reduction in aquifer outflow as the two reach sections were in the region that observed high reduction in groundwater levels fig 17 flux decreased by as much as 33 in reach 8 and 14 in reach 2 both of which were observed in october and november after the 2011 growing season it was also observed that reach 2 was not able to recover to the calibrated model flux levels even in december of 2013 while all the other reaches did not recover till at least december 2012 fig 17 simulation of the projected irrigation scenario helped identify the critical regions in the lower acf river basin that are most susceptible to decreases in groundwater levels as a result of an increase in groundwater use for irrigation critical regions identified in the spring and ichawaynochaway watersheds in this study were similar to those identified by mitra et al 2019 however regions in the lower flint and kinchafoonee muckalee watersheds that showed a substantial reduction in this study were not indicated in the previous study the scenario analysis also helped identify reach sections that are most susceptible to the increase in groundwater use for irrigation substantial reduction in groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux especially at the end of the growing season figs 16a and 17 indicate that the ufa might not be able to provide a sustainable supply of groundwater for increasing irrigation demand in the future especially under drought conditions the reduction in stream aquifer flux also indicates to a reduction in streamflow in the region which can lower streamflow levels and impact the habitat of the endangered mussel species in the region freshwater flows to the downstream apalachicola bay will also likely decline as a result of reduction in downstream flow the impact on the ufa and the streams that are connected to it could be worse if the drought persists for a longer time period and the aquifer has to sustain the projected irrigation for multiple years increased loss of stream aquifer flux can lead to more streams going dry and severely impact the local ecological habitat 4 summary and conclusion this study developed a groundwater model for the ufa in the lower acf river basin using modflow nwt to evaluate the impacts of the projected increase in irrigation in the groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux of the region spatio temporal evaluation after calibration of both groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux showed that the model can adequately simulate groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux throughout the model domain and for both wet and dry climatic periods the model was however able to simulate stream aquifer flux better in the region where the aquifer was thicker and had less variability in groundwater levels evaluation of the groundwater budget showed that recharge was the most important groundwater inflow into the system while river outflow was the most important source of groundwater outflow this also indicated the importance of the ufa in maintaining streamflow in the region especially under drought conditions monthly evaluation of the groundwater budget showed that a decrease in groundwater recharge due to prolonged drought conditions can severely reduce flow from the aquifers to the rivers in the region which gets further exacerbated during the growing season due to increased water withdrawal for irrigation the rebound of the stream aquifer flux with the return of normal precipitation to pre drought levels indicated to the rebound potential of the aquifer but also highlighted the vulnerability of the region to prolonged drought conditions sensitivity analysis of recharge zones identified upland instream karst as the most sensitive geohydrologic zone for recharge into the aquifer geohydrologic zones in the region where the aquifer thickness was lower and close to the land surface were generally identified as sensitive to groundwater recharge simulation and evaluation of the change in groundwater levels due to the projected increase in groundwater withdrawal for irrigation showed that the groundwater levels would decrease by more than 1 m in many parts of the ufa and by as much as 2 38 m when compared to the levels observed in 2011 large reductions in groundwater levels in the lower flint and kinchafoonee watersheds followed by the spring and ichawaynochaway watersheds helped identify the regions the most vulnerable to increase in irrigation reach sections in the lower flint and the adjoining kinchafoonee watersheds saw a substantial reduction in stream aquifer flux by as much as 33 this indicated that the aquifer might not be able to sustain the projected increase in groundwater pumpage for irrigation especially under prolonged drought conditions sustainable agriculture with increased water use efficiency that can reduce water use converting agricultural lands and crops in the critical areas to other types that are less water intensive and artificial recharge are some potential management decisions that can be vital for the long term sustainability of the aquifer as well as the surficial streams in the region

8274,study region lower apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf river basin southeastern united states u s study focus excessive groundwater withdrawal for irrigation from the upper floridan aquifer is an important issue in the lower acf river basin as it has led to decline in groundwater levels as well as reduction in baseflows since the withdrawal is projected to further increase in the future this study evaluated the impacts of the projected increase in irrigation on the groundwater levels as well as the stream aquifer flux in the region the study also identified regions that are most important for groundwater recharge new hydrological insights into the region evaluation of the geohydrologic zones identified upland instream karst as the most sensitive zone for recharge into the aquifer while zones in the region where the aquifer thickness was comparatively lower and close to the land surface was generally identified as sensitive simulation of the projected irrigation scenario predicted a reduction in groundwater levels by as much as 2 38 m while a general reduction was predicted in much of the model domain large groundwater level reductions were mostly predicted in regions where the aquifer is comparatively thinner evaluation of the changes in stream aquifer flux showed that flux reduced by as much as 33 with large reductions predicted in the lower flint and kinchafoonee watersheds this study also helped identify localized zones and stream sections most susceptible to the impacts of increase in irrigation keywords modflow lower acf river basin groundwater irrigation groundwater surface water interaction upper floridan aquifer 1 introduction groundwater resources play a critical role in the agricultural and ecological vitality of the lower apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf river basin in south georgia united states u s the upper floridan aquifer ufa that underlies the river basin fig 1 is one of the most productive aquifer systems in the world and is the primary source of water for agricultural industrial and municipal use in the region torak and painter 2006 it plays a critical role in the agricultural economy of the region that generates more than 2 billion in farm based revenue annually wolfe and stubbs 2014 as it supplies about 80 of the total irrigation demand for irrigating more than 200 000 ha of agricultural land through more than 4 000 irrigation wells painter et al 2015 torak and painter 2006 the ufa supplied an estimated 1 7 million cubic meters of water for irrigation in 2015 ga epd 2017 but withdrawals from the ufa can be as high as 3 6 million cubic meters during drought years couch and mcdowell 2006 jones et al 2017 as the ufa is karstic in nature and close to the land surface the region is characterized by sinkhole ponds karst sinks incised streambeds and conduits that exposes the limestone to the surface characteristics typical to a karstic topography this has created a direct hydraulic connection of the underlying aquifer system with the surficial rivers and lake systems throughout much of the lower acf river basin torak and painter 2006 as a result the ufa is an important contributor to streamflow in many of the surficial streams contributing tens of million cubic meters of water every day as baseflow torak and painter 2006 intense groundwater withdrawals for irrigation however has led to a decline in groundwater levels and has also resulted in the reduction of baseflow to the streams in the lower acf river basin jones and torak 2006 singh et al 2016 2017 the region has witnessed an increase in no flow and low flow periods in many perennial streams singh et al 2016 the situation is further exacerbated by the recurring drought conditions in the region including those that occurred in 1985 1989 1999 2002 2010 2012 and 2016 pumpage induced groundwater level fluctuations of nearly 10 m were observed during multiple severe droughts in the last two decades with a record or near record low groundwater levels in most wells gordon et al 2012 torak and painter 2006 flows in the spring fed streams in the region also decreased by 50 100 during drought periods gwc 2017 the recurring drought conditions along with agriculture intensification in the lower acf have threatened the already limited groundwater resources as well as the future of the agricultural economy in the region along with agriculture the increasing low flow and no flow stream conditions have severely affected the endangered and threated species of freshwater mussels in the lower acf river basin gagnon et al 2004 golladay et al 2004 shea et al 2013 declining downstream flow as a result of reduced baseflow conditions in the lower acf river basin especially during drought periods has also impacted freshwater inflow into the downstream apalachicola bay as well as reservoir operatios and led to the tri state water wars since the 1980s between the neighboring states of alabama

groundwater sources as well as for a range of weather conditions projects the groundwater demand for agricultural irrigation in the lower acf river basin to further increase from 2015 to 2050 during dry years by 16 lower flint ochlockonee regional water planning council 2017 it is of paramount importance to understand the spatial and temporal impacts of this projected increase in groundwater withdrawal from the ufa on groundwater levels and stream aquifer interaction especially in drought years to determine if the ufa can sustain this increased withdrawal to maintain agricultural productivity without adversely affecting the surface and groundwater resources of the region adverse impact of groundwater over exploitation in the region has led to numerous studies to evaluate the spatio temporal impacts of groundwater use on the groundwater levels and surface and groundwater interaction jones and torak 2006 developed a finite element groundwater model and evaluated the impacts of seasonal groundwater pumpage for irrigation in drought conditions including a comprehensive water budget for the ufa mitra et al 2016 utilized the model developed by jones and torak 2006 and simulated the transient drought conditions from 2010 to 2012 to evaluate its impact on the groundwater levels and the groundwater budget of the region they also assessed the impacts of irrigation during drought conditions the modular finite element model modfe torak 1993 used by jones and torak 2006 was calibrated under steady state conditions while mitra et al 2016 validated the model utilizing data from a single month singh et al 2017 identified critical streams and tributaries that were adversely affected by irrigation pumping using principal component and k means clustering analysis and evaluated the effectiveness of water restriction scenarios on the stream aquifer flux jones et al 2017 developed a usgs modular finite difference groundwater flow model modflow harbaugh 2005 that was calibrated for transient conditions for groundwater levels and baseflow for the ufa and the overlying semi confining unit to evaluate the hydrologic budget for the 2008 2012 drought baseflow calibration for the model was performed for only a limited area in the model domain these studies however have mostly focused on evaluating the drought impacts under current groundwater withdrawals for irrigation and there has been limited study evaluating the impacts of increasing irrigation in the region although mitra et al 2019 evaluated the sensitivity of groundwater levels to increase in irrigation in the region the simulated increase was a constant increase of the 2011 groundwater pumpage values over the entire model domain this increase might not accurately reflect the changes in the spatial distribution as well as the increase in irrigation due to increasing agricultural lands that are better accounted for in the gwpcc projections simulating the gwpcc scenario can help us get a more accurate understanding of the potential impacts of increase in irrigation understanding the change in groundwater levels as well as the quantitative interactions between the ufa and the surface streams in different parts of the study region under projected water withdrawal scenario can help identify the regions and stream reaches that are most vulnerable this information can be critical for developing long term agricultural and environmental sustainability plan for the region failure to protect aquatic habitat due to low flow conditions in surface streams of this region because of unsustainable withdrawals from ufa can potentially lead to water use restrictions which can negatively affect agricultural productivity and rural communities of the region understanding the changes in stream aquifer flux due to the projected withdrawals in drought years can also help water managers to avoid potential conflict amongst the water users of this region hence the main goal of this study was to simulate and evaluate the impacts of the projected increase in irrigation in the groundwater levels and stream aquifer interaction in the region using modflow this study also adds to the previous modeling efforts in the region by developing a two layered three dimensional groundwater model for the ufa in the lower acf river basin using modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 that is calibrated for transient conditions for groundwater level and stream aquifer flux baseflow discharge from aquifer for both wet and dry years and throughout the model domain the study also identified sensitive recharge zones within the model domain for groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux which to the authors knowledge has not been evaluated for the region specifically the three main objectives of this paper were to i develop a three dimensional calibrated groundwater flow model for the ufa in the lower acf using the usgs modflow nwt ii identify critical zones for groundwater recharge sensitive to groundwater levels and flow and iii simulate projected irrigation scenario and quantify the effects of the projected withdrawals on the ufa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and geohydrology of the ufa the focus area for this research is the ufa in the agriculturally intensive region of the lower acf river basin hence the modeled region includes parts of south georgia southeastern alabama and northwestern florida of southeastern u s and is approximately 12 000 km2 in area fig 2 a forests and agricultural land are the dominant land cover and land use types in the study area covering about 46 and 39 respectively while urban area accounts for only about 6 of the total area homer et al 2020 longleaf pine pinus taeda is the dominant forest species ruefenacht et al 2008 while cotton peanut and corn are the major row corps produced in the region the climate of the region is humid subtropical characterized by long hot and humid summers and mild winters average temperature ranges from about 17 in the winter to about 33 7 in the summer arguez et al 2012 but temperatures above 37 7 100 are common in the summer precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year and averages annually about 1365 mm in the south to about 1161 mm in the north of the study area arguez et al 2012 precipitation in the winter however accounts for almost all of the areal recharge to the ufa as the frontal low intensity and long duration rainfall along with low evapotranspiration is conducive to recharge summer precipitation events are convective with high intensity and short duration resulting in more surface runoff land elevation of the study region ranges from about 148 m in the northeastern boundary of the study area to about 11 m in the southern boundary fig 2a agriculture accounts for the highest water use in the area of which more than 80 is supplied by the ufa rugel et al 2012 groundwater withdrawals for irrigation have steadily increased in the lower acf river basin since the 1970s with the expansion of center pivot irrigation systems gwc 2017 groundwater irrigation increased by 59 from 2005 to 2010 while surface water irrigation decreased during the same time period lawrence 2016 the modeled area lies in the coastal plain physiographic province and consists mostly of a low lying karstic region called the dougherty plain physiographic district torak and painter 2006 the dougherty plain is characterized by relatively flat inner lowland containing sub surface and internal drainage and heterogeneous stream development typical to a karst topography torak and painter 2006 the ufa in most of the modeling domain consists of the ocala limestone of the eocene period with locally variable hydraulic conductivity that ranges from less than 21 m day to more than 150 m day over the region torak and painter 2006 overlying the ufa is the discontinuous undifferentiated overburden weathered residuum and undifferentiated surficial deposits that may contain water bearing zones and are together referred to as the upper semi confining unit uscu regions where the uscu is absent or thin or where the ufa outcrops to the surface are sources for direct recharge to the aquifer the aquifer also receives recharge through the uscu as vertical leakage of water torak and painter 2006 major rivers and streams have cut shallow channels through the uscu to the underlying ufa that is close to the land surface resulting in a direct connection between the ufa and the rivers and streams that flow through the area the ufa outcrops in the northwestern boundary of the study domain and dips towards the southeast with the thickness of the aquifer ranging from about 9 m in the outcrop area to more than 200 m in the southern end of the modeling domain torak and painter 2006 williams and kuniansky 2016 fig 2b groundwater levels in the ufa fluctuate seasonally with yearly maximum from late winter to early spring due to increased recharge as well as reduced evapotranspiration et and agricultural demand yearly minimums are often observed in mid to late fall due to increased water use for irrigation reduced recharge and higher et demand during the summer months torak and painter 2006 the modeling domain and the geohydrologic setting for the domain are based on the area described by torak and painter 2006 which describes in detail the groundwater flow and geohydrology of the ufa and the overlying and underlying units in the study region and are referred to for further detail 2 2 modflow nwt modflow is a block centered finite difference groundwater model developed by the usgs that can be utilized for two or three dimensional applications in solving groundwater flow problems modflow uses a modular structure that allows for each boundary condition option to be independent of each other and allows for adding or removing of options harbaugh 2005 the groundwater flow model for this study was developed using modflow nwt a newton formulation of modflow 2005 niswonger et al 2011 modflow nwt is a standalone version that must be used with the upstream weighting package upw it expands on the capacity of modflow 2005 to solve the problem of constant drying and rewetting non linearities when simulating unconfined systems that can lead to the issue of model instability and non convergence when using other versions of modflow hunt and feinstein 2012 niswonger et al 2011 although the karstic system of the ufa could have the presence of conduit and fractured flow and the use of an equivalent porous media model could probably not represent the system very accurately previous groundwater modeling studies successfully modeled the region while excluding the representation of any local conduit flows that might be present jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 kuniansky 2016 also showed that an equivalent porous media model without representation of local conduit flows can adequately simulate the groundwater levels of a karstic system and hence was used in this research the governing equation for each cell in modflow for groundwater flow is based on the continuity equation and is expressed as harbaugh 2005 1 q i s s δ h δ t δ v where q i is the flow rate into the cell l3t 1 s s is the specific storage l 1 δ v is the volume of the cell l3 δ h is the change in the head l and δ t is the time interval t 2 3 conceptual model development the conceptual flow model for the ufa in the lower acf river basin is based on the geohydrologic study of torak and painter 2006 of the region and similar to the model developed by jones and torak 2006 and jones et al 2017 groundwater recharge from precipitation as vertical leakage from the overlying uscu where present and as direct recharge where it is thin or absent are the biggest source of groundwater flow into the system the northwestern boundary where the ufa outcrops is considered the saturated updip limit of the aquifer and the regional groundwater flow occurs from the northwest to southeast as the ufa downdips in that direction groundwater level in the updip area of the ufa fluctuates very little throughout the year the regional outflow of groundwater occurs from the south and southeastern boundary based on the potentiometric maps of the ufa gordon and peck 2010 kinnaman and dixon 2011 the biggest outflow from the ufa is to the rivers and streams in the region as the aquifer and the surficial streams are in direct connection throughout the region groundwater pumpage is another important source of outflow from the aquifer which peaks during june july of the growing season when the irrigation demand is at the highest level lake seminole and lake blackshear which are actively managed reservoirs within the model domain are maintained at or near constant levels throughout the year and impact the local groundwater levels underlying the ufa is an impermeable layer known as the lisbon formation that acts as the lower confining unit to the aquifer 2 4 numerical model development a three dimensional groundwater flow model was developed using modflow nwt based on the conceptualization of the flow system for the modeled region which is defined by the following partial differential equation harbaugh 2005 2 x k x x h d x y k y y h d y x k z z h d z w s s h t where k x x k y y a n d k z z are values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h is the potentiometric head l w is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and sinks t 1 s s is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 and t is time t data pre processing and post processing for preparing the model inputs for the modflow nwt was performed using modelmuse a graphical user interface developed by usgs winston 2009 2 4 1 model discretization a two layered groundwater model with a uniform grid size of 750m 750m was developed that represented the uscu and the ufa fig 3 the model has 282 rows and 102 columns resulting in a total of 28 764 grid cells of which 21 394 are active the bottom elevation of the ufa was combined with the thickness of the ufa both acquired from williams and dixon 2015 to determine the top of the ufa a digital elevation model dem of the land surface was then acquired from usgs gesch et al 2002 to determine the thickness and the top of the uscu manual adjustments had to be made for grid cells that resulted in having the top of the ufa higher than the top of the uscu using the two datasets a transient model was built from 2007 to 2013 with monthly stress periods and daily time steps this allowed for comparison between model simulated groundwater level with observed daily groundwater levels rather than comparing with monthly averages thus giving better confidence in the model performance initial hydraulic conductivity for the ufa and uscu as well as the specific yield and specific storage information for model setup were derived from the previous studies in the region which were then adjusted during model calibration jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 2 4 2 boundary conditions the base of the ufa was simulated as a no flow boundary as the lower confining unit below the ufa acts as an impermeable layer the updip limit of the ufa in the northwestern boundary of the model was simulated as a specified head boundary condition anderson et al 2015 fig 3 using the time variant specified head package chd as there was a minimal fluctuation in the groundwater head throughout the year the remaining of the regional boundary of the model was simulated as a general head dependent boundary ghb condition anderson et al 2015 using the ghb package fig 3 two lakes in the model domain were also simulated using the ghb package and lake level elevations were provided for each stress period fig 3 groundwater head for the regional chd and ghb boundaries were provided by averaging the potentiometric heads from gordon and peck 2010 and kinnaman and dixon 2011 and kept constant throughout the simulation for model simplicity groundwater pumpage was an important boundary condition that needed to be estimated accurately for input in the model monthly groundwater withdrawal estimates from the ufa were acquired from the georgia environmental protection division epd at hydrologic unit code huc 12 level which was then divided equally to each well within the huc 12 watershed fig 4 groundwater pumpage was simulated as a specified flux package anderson et al 2015 using the well package wel ephemeral streams that had the possibility of going dry were simulated using the drain package drn while the perennial streams were simulated using the river package riv fig 3 streambed depth for the drn and riv packages were acquired from previous studies performed in the region jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 initial values for streambed conductance were also acquired from the previous studies which were then calibrated during the model calibration period stream elevation for the riv package was estimated by interpolating stream stages from usgs stations with continuous observed data for the simulation period and the lake levels from the two lakes areal recharge from precipitation is a very important boundary condition in the model as it has the greatest influence in the groundwater budget but is also the most difficult to estimate healy 2010 groundwater recharge can vary greatly spatially and temporally as it is influenced by the variation in land use vegetation geohydrologic conditions climate and land management practices among others healy 2010 sophocleous 2005 groundwater recharge for this study was estimated using a physically based semi distributed watershed scale continuous simulation water balance based model called the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 swat accounts for the spatial and temporal variability in recharge as it maintains the spatial heterogeneity of a watershed by dividing it into sub watersheds and each sub watershed is further divided into hydrologic response units hrus which are the basic units for calculation many studies have successfully used swat to estimate groundwater recharge gyamfi et al 2017 lee et al 2019 raposo et al 2013 a swat model was developed for the study region fig 5 that incorporated the major land use types and agricultural crop rotations the model was then calibrated and validated for streamflow for 5 usgs streamflow stations within the watershed table 1 fig 5 after which groundwater recharge estimates were acquired for each sub watershed and incorporated into the modflow as a specified flux anderson et al 2015 using the recharge package rch fig 6 the developed swat model had a total of 160 sub watersheds of which 89 were partially or completely located within the groundwater model domain fig 5 and used for estimating groundwater recharge 2 5 model calibration model calibration was a two step process and involved matching simulated groundwater levels to observed levels followed by matching model simulated stream aquifer flux to its observed counterpart for the 2007 2013 period observed groundwater levels and streamflow data used for model calibration were acquired from the usgs national water information system nwis usgs 2019 2 360 daily groundwater observation data of the ufa were acquired from 359 wells in the model domain lack of observed groundwater observation data in the overlying uscu limited us to calibrating the groundwater head only for the ufa model performance evaluation for simulating groundwater head was performed by calculating the root mean square rms of the groundwater head residual which can be calculated as 3 r m s 1 n i 1 n h i s i m h i o b s 2 1 2 where n is the number of residuals h i s i m is the simulated head l and h i o b s l is the observed head along with rms a value of less than 0 1 for the ratio of the standard deviation of residuals std divided by the range r of observed groundwater levels also indicates a good model fit kuniansky et al 2004 and was also used for evaluation along with the statistical measures graphical measures including the plot of the frequency histogram of residuals and spatial distribution of residuals were also used for evaluating model performance calibration of stream aquifer flux was performed by comparing the simulated flux to monthly averaged estimated flux for a reach section which was estimated by subtracting the baseflow at the upstream from the downstream end of a reach a positive flux indicates a gaining stream and that the aquifer contributed water to streamflow in the reach section while a negative flux indicates a losing stream and that the stream lost water in that section as there are uncertainties associated with streamflow the estimation of baseflow and the resulting estimated observed flux for a reach section a target range of flux was calculated for each reach section to aid in calibration following the procedure similar to utilized by jones and torak 2006 the error factors ef of 10 0 10 and 5 0 05 were applied to reach sections having average streamflow less than and greater than 7 07 m3 s respectively jones and torak 2006 although measurement errors can be larger in reach sections with high flows the percent error can be higher in reach sections with smaller flows due to which a higher ef was used for reach section with smaller flows the target range was calculated as follows 4 f l o w m i n q d e f q d q u e f q u 5 f l o w m a x q d e f q d q u e f q u where f l o w m i n is the minimum target flow f l o w m a x is the maximum target flow q d is the downstream flow q u is the upstream flow and e f is the error factor daily baseflow estimates for calculating the target range fluxes were acquired using the usgs groundwater toolbox barlow et al 2015 the model was calibrated for stream aquifer flux for 6 reach sections reach 2 3 4 5 6 and 8 fig 7 as the lower flint river basin region was the major focus of the study stream reaches in and contributing to the lower flint were calibrated for stream aquifer flux in this study fig 7 also shows the upstream and downstream usgs stations that were used to estimate the target flux range for each reach section model calibration was performed by adjusting the hydraulic conductivity of the ufa streambed conductance for the riv and drn packages and specific storage values using automated and manual calibraiton approaches the model domain was divided into 14 hydraulic conductivity zones for the ufa 10 drn zones and 15 riv zones for calibration purposes ucode an inverse modeling tool for model calibration poeter and hill 1999 1998 was used to identify the sensitive hydraulic conductivity zones and river sections and perform initial automated calibration runs after which the model was calibrated manually for further refinement a sensitivity analysis was also performed by dividing the rch boundary condition into zones to identify critical groundwater recharge areas within the model domain that were sensitive and critical for groundwater level and flow this can potentially help decision makers identify target zones for land management for potentially improving groundwater recharge although it is ideally desired for hydrological models to be validated for an independent time period after calibration limited observed datasets for setting up the boundary conditions as well as model parameterization often limit groundwater models to only calibration jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 wang et al 2008 xue et al 2018 the groundwater model for this study was developed from only 2007 2013 due to the limited availability of groundwater irrigation data as the simulation period was limited but included extreme drought as well as wet conditions fig 6 a concerted effort was made to calibrate the model for the total simulation period rather than dividing between calibration and validation periods so that the model can be adequately parameterized for a range of climatic conditions calibration of multiple hydrologic variables as well as comprehensive evaluation of groundwater budget components after model calibration gives adequate confidence in simulated model results 2 6 irrigation scenario evaluating the spatio temporal impacts in the groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux due to fine resolution projected increase in groundwater irrigation scenario at huc 12 level can provide important information that can be critical for developing management plans for the long term sustainability agricultural productivity and protecting the ecological habitat of the ufa and the lower acf river basin gwpcc estimated agricultural water demand for the years 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 for dry wet and normal climate conditions to include the potential climate extremes of the irrigation scenarios the 75th percentile value which represents dry conditions with higher irrigation demands is used by gwpcc for planning purposes lower flint ochlockonee regional water planning council 2017 hence the irrigation scenario in this study was also evaluated for the 75th percentile evaluation of the 75th percentile groundwater irrigation water use scenario from 2020 to 2050 for each month showed a similar increasing trend in irrigation demand from 2020 to 2050 fig 8 a hence only the 2040 75th percentile irrigation scenario was selected for evaluation in this study scenario analysis was performed by replacing the irrigation demand of the year 2011 which was a dry year with the 2040 75th percentile irrigation demand herein from referred to as the scenario model run and comparing it to groundwater levels and stream flux values obtained from the calibrated model run to estimate the impacts of the projected increase in agricultural irrigation demand in a dry year fig 8b this also allowed us to evaluate the aquifer rebound potential and long term impact by comparing the calibrated and scenario model results till 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater level calibration as the model was calibrated only for transient conditions from 2007 to 2013 a model warm up was performed by replicating the stress periods of the first year of simulation for four years replication of the stress period for four years allowed for adequate model warm up without the loss of observed data that can be used for model calibration comparison between the 2 370 observed groundwater levels and its corresponding simulated values for the simulation period of 2007 2013 using a scatter plot fig 9 a shows that simulated groundwater levels from the calibrated model closely matched the observed groundwater levels in the ufa rms of groundwater head residual for the simulation period was 2 68 m which was close to the rms values in the previous modeling studies in the area jones et al 2017 jones and torak 2006 mitra et al 2016 jones and torak 2006 have stated that a simulation error of less than 2 8 m can be considered acceptable after accounting for the uncertainties and potential error in the aquifer geometry and groundwater level measurement the calculated ratio of std r was 0 03 which was less than 0 1 indicating a good model fit frequency histogram fig 9b and cumulative distribution plot fig 9c of the residuals showed that more than 80 of the residuals were less than 3 m and more than 92 of the residuals were less than 4 5 m the histogram also shows no skewness in the simulation of the groundwater level indicating that the model generally did not over or under simulate the groundwater levels evaluation and plotting of the mean groundwater head residual for each groundwater well showed that the model was also able to adequately simulate the spatial variability of groundwater levels in the model domain as shown by the random distribution of residuals fig 10 rms of the groundwater residuals was also calculated for each month in the simulation period to evaluate the groundwater model for simulating the temporal variation of the groundwater head rms of less than 2 86 m in 65 of the 83 months and less than 4 m in 79 of the 83 months fig 11 demonstrated that the model was also able to adequately simulate the temporal variability in the groundwater level of the ufa in the model domain overall groundwater calibration results showed that the model can adequately simulate groundwater levels in the ufa both temporally and spatially the model also performed adequately for dry as well as wet climate conditions as the calibration period included both dry 2011 2012 and wet periods 2008 2010 3 2 groundwater flux calibration calibration of stream aquifer flux along with groundwater levels in the model is critical for increasing model robustness and confidence in the simulation results as calibration of multiple variables helps constrain the model parameters better simulated stream aquifer flux and the target flux range for each reach section estimated based on the flow difference between the upstream and downstream end of the reach and the ef are presented in fig 12 stream aquifer flux for each section was calibrated by adjusting the streambed conductance it is important to note that reach 3 and 4 are along the tributary streams to the flint river where the aquifer is also relatively while the remaining four reach sections are along the main stem of the flint river where the aquifer is comparitavely thicker estimated baseflow derived from observed streamflow as a result are smaller for the two reach sections resulting in much smaller target flux range than the other reach sections this also indicates to a smaller baseflow contribution from the ufa for the two reach sections when compared to the other reach sections comparison between the simulated and target flux for all reach sections demonstrated that the model does an adequate job of simulating stream aquifer fluxes as most of the simulated fluxes are within or close to the target range for much of the simulation the model is however not able to capture the high flux estimates for oct 2010 april 2011 in reach 2 fig 12a and 3 fig 12b where the estimated target flux is much higher than the rest of the simulation period this could potentially have resulted because of the inability of the baseflow filter program to estimate accurate baseflow because of increased surface runoff and potentially sub surface later runoff during this high flow period the model was also able to capture the temporal variability in stream aquifer flux for all reach sections except for reach 2 the smallest reach section calibrated in the model was reach 4 and also the only section that had negative flux for most of the time period indicating that the reach was behaving as a losing reach for much of the simulation period and consistently during the drought periods of 2011 2012 simulation of stream aquifer flux was much better for reaches 5 6 and 8 fig 12d e and f which were along the main stem of the flint river in the lower flint river basin and had a direct connection to the aquifer section that was much deeper overall the flux calibration result shows that the calibrated model can adequately simulate and capture the temporal and spatial variability of stream aquifer flux for the stream reaches in the lower flint and adjoining reaches the model was however able to estimate stream aquifer flux better at reach sections that were in the region where the aquifer was thicker and had less variability in groundwater levels 3 3 groundwater budget groundwater budget evaluation provides critical information about the important groundwater components of the region and the impact on different components with a change in boundary conditions such as recharge and groundwater pumpage evaluation of net flux inflow outflow for each boundary condition for the whole simulation period showed that recharge rch was the biggest source of groundwater inflow and averaged about 8 500 megaliters per day mld with a minimal contribution also from the outcrop area chd averaging about 1 100 mld fig 13 perennial rivers riv accounted for the biggest outflow from the model domain about 6 300 mld fig 13 showing evidence to the fact that the ufa is an important contributor to streamflow in the region groundwater wells wel and ephemeral streams drn averaged less than 1 000 mgd of outflow while there was also a net outflow from the remaining regional boundary and lakes gbh at slightly higher than 1 000 mld fig 13 as the groundwater levels in the ufa follow a distinct pattern of seasonality monthly groundwater budget evaluation for the model was also performed fig 14 to evaluate its impact on the groundwater components as most groundwater recharge occurs in the winter months december march the groundwater level of the aquifer system is normally highest in the spring april may groundwater outflow to perennial rivers and ephemeral streams as a result is biggest during this time of the year which gradually decreases with summer and fall as there is a gradual decrease in groundwater level due to minimal recharge and increased groundwater pumpage for irrigation fig 14 the years 2011 and 2012 were drought years and the monthly groundwater budget of the two years clearly show the impact on the stream aquifer flux with reduced outflow to rivers due to drought conditions february 2013 which was preceded by prolonged drought was the only month during the whole simulation period that had a net positive flux for the river outflow riv indicating a net inflow of water from the rivers to the aquifer and demonstrates the negative impact drought can have in the region fig 14 the river flux returns to normality with higher than normal recharge in 2013 this exhibits the potential of the aquifer system in the region and the river flux to rebound quickly to normal levels after drought conditions but also demonstrates the vulnerability of the stream aquifer flux and streamflow in the region to prolonged drought that can be exacerbated by increased groundwater pumpage demand and withdrawal for irrigation during such periods 3 4 groundwater recharge critical zones the uscu was divided into 15 geohydrologic zones by torak and painter 2006 based on the hydrologic and geologic setting and the potential for recharge to the ufa fig 15 a scarcity of groundwater wells in the uscu makes it difficult for evaluating the recharge potential and sensitivity of the geohydrologic zones for recharge into the ufa hence monthly recharge estimates obtained from the swat model were divided into 15 recharge zones in the rch package based on the geohydrologic zones and sensitivity analysis was performed using ucode to determine the sensitivity of each zone to simulating groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux fig 15a and b present the 15 geohydrologic zones and the composite scaled sensitivity css for the 15 zones respectively css in ucode indicates the sensitivity of the parameter to the observed values for estimating the parameter value accurately with higher values indicating higher sensitivity results showed that zone 11 upland interstream karst was the most sensitive recharge zone followed by zones 10 4 3 6 12 and 7 upland instream instream karst swamp instream karst upland outcrop and solution escarpment torak and painter 2006 recharge zones were mostly sensitive in the region where the ufa is comparatively thinner and close to the land surface where groundwater recharge can reach to the ufa quickly and can create substantial variations in the groundwater level identification of the sensitive recharge zones can provide potential information in identifying the critical recharge zones that are most sensitive to groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux it should be however noted that sensitivity analysis results are dependent on the observations provided and although a concerted effort was made to include observations that were distributed temporally and spatially lack of observations in some zones e g zone 5 and zone 9 could have biased the sensitivity analysis results 3 5 impact of projected increase in irrigation demand groundwater levels from the scenario model run in which the january to december 2011 irrigation data was replaced with the 2040 projected irrigation were compared against the calibrated model run for four time periods to study the short first day of september 2011 and december 2011 and long term first day of march 2012 and december 2013 impacts of the projected increase in irrigation fig 16 evaluation of change in groundwater levels towards the end of the growing season fig 16a showed that the groundwater levels would have further decreased by more than 1 m in many parts of the ufa and by as much as 2 38 m in the lower flint river basin as compared to the groundwater levels of 2011 for that time period large groundwater level decrease was mostly predicted in regions where the aquifer is comparatively thinner in the lower flint and the adjoining kinchafoonee ichawaynochaway and spring huc 8 watersheds but there was some groundwater level decrease predicted throughout most of the aquifer assessment of the groundwater level in december 2011 fig 16b and march 2012 fig 16c showed gradual rebounding of the aquifer levels although groundwater levels were still lower by half a meter in many places the aquifer was not able to fully recover to the groundwater levels of december 2013 fig 16d even after the higher than normal recharge fig 6 in 2013 comparison of simulated stream aquifer flux river outflow from the aquifer between the calibrated and scenario model run from 2011 to 2013 fig 17 also showed a reduction in stream aquifer flux in all the evaluated reach sections because of the increase in irrigation and the subsequent reduction in groundwater levels fig 17 reach 2 and 8 which are in the kinchafoonee and lower flint watersheds respectively saw the biggest relative reduction in aquifer outflow as the two reach sections were in the region that observed high reduction in groundwater levels fig 17 flux decreased by as much as 33 in reach 8 and 14 in reach 2 both of which were observed in october and november after the 2011 growing season it was also observed that reach 2 was not able to recover to the calibrated model flux levels even in december of 2013 while all the other reaches did not recover till at least december 2012 fig 17 simulation of the projected irrigation scenario helped identify the critical regions in the lower acf river basin that are most susceptible to decreases in groundwater levels as a result of an increase in groundwater use for irrigation critical regions identified in the spring and ichawaynochaway watersheds in this study were similar to those identified by mitra et al 2019 however regions in the lower flint and kinchafoonee muckalee watersheds that showed a substantial reduction in this study were not indicated in the previous study the scenario analysis also helped identify reach sections that are most susceptible to the increase in groundwater use for irrigation substantial reduction in groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux especially at the end of the growing season figs 16a and 17 indicate that the ufa might not be able to provide a sustainable supply of groundwater for increasing irrigation demand in the future especially under drought conditions the reduction in stream aquifer flux also indicates to a reduction in streamflow in the region which can lower streamflow levels and impact the habitat of the endangered mussel species in the region freshwater flows to the downstream apalachicola bay will also likely decline as a result of reduction in downstream flow the impact on the ufa and the streams that are connected to it could be worse if the drought persists for a longer time period and the aquifer has to sustain the projected irrigation for multiple years increased loss of stream aquifer flux can lead to more streams going dry and severely impact the local ecological habitat 4 summary and conclusion this study developed a groundwater model for the ufa in the lower acf river basin using modflow nwt to evaluate the impacts of the projected increase in irrigation in the groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux of the region spatio temporal evaluation after calibration of both groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux showed that the model can adequately simulate groundwater levels and stream aquifer flux throughout the model domain and for both wet and dry climatic periods the model was however able to simulate stream aquifer flux better in the region where the aquifer was thicker and had less variability in groundwater levels evaluation of the groundwater budget showed that recharge was the most important groundwater inflow into the system while river outflow was the most important source of groundwater outflow this also indicated the importance of the ufa in maintaining streamflow in the region especially under drought conditions monthly evaluation of the groundwater budget showed that a decrease in groundwater recharge due to prolonged drought conditions can severely reduce flow from the aquifers to the rivers in the region which gets further exacerbated during the growing season due to increased water withdrawal for irrigation the rebound of the stream aquifer flux with the return of normal precipitation to pre drought levels indicated to the rebound potential of the aquifer but also highlighted the vulnerability of the region to prolonged drought conditions sensitivity analysis of recharge zones identified upland instream karst as the most sensitive geohydrologic zone for recharge into the aquifer geohydrologic zones in the region where the aquifer thickness was lower and close to the land surface were generally identified as sensitive to groundwater recharge simulation and evaluation of the change in groundwater levels due to the projected increase in groundwater withdrawal for irrigation showed that the groundwater levels would decrease by more than 1 m in many parts of the ufa and by as much as 2 38 m when compared to the levels observed in 2011 large reductions in groundwater levels in the lower flint and kinchafoonee watersheds followed by the spring and ichawaynochaway watersheds helped identify the regions the most vulnerable to increase in irrigation reach sections in the lower flint and the adjoining kinchafoonee watersheds saw a substantial reduction in stream aquifer flux by as much as 33 this indicated that the aquifer might not be able to sustain the projected increase in groundwater pumpage for irrigation especially under prolonged drought conditions sustainable agriculture with increased water use efficiency that can reduce water use converting agricultural lands and crops in the critical areas to other types that are less water intensive and artificial recharge are some potential management decisions that can be vital for the long term sustainability of the aquifer as well as the surficial streams in the region
