14095,primary clarifier plays vital role in removal of pollutants present as total suspended solids tss in wastewater in this research work prediction of effluent tss present in the sedimentation tank of clariflocculator is reported the data of common effluent treatment plant cetp ahmedabad india has been used in the development of soft sensor the mechanistic and fuzzy inference system fis soft sensor models have been developed the models predict the effluent total suspended solids tsse of clariflocculator process based on the measurement of influent flow rate qf and influent total suspended solids tssin the root mean square error rmse of mechanistic model and fuzzy inference system were 30 and 48 respectively for the data samples qf ranging from 800 to 900 m3 h and tssin from 300 600 mg l these ranges are typically observed throughout the year at cetp ahmedabad india the percentage mean accuracy for mechanistic model was 88 the difference between predicted and actual measured values of rmse and percentage mean accuracy of mechanistic model is acceptable as system is highly sensitive mechanistic model gives information of total suspended solids present in retentate as well as tss present at different height of the sedimentation tank in addition to tss present in effluent keywords sedimentation tank total suspended solids tss clarifier fuzzy inference system 1 introduction a significant focus on wastewater treatment analysis and simulation of water quality parameters have been paid in recent years 1 wastewater treatment is carried out either in individual industry where it generates or wastewater of various industries are collected and treated at common treatment plant at many places in the world common treatment plants are in operation where wastewater of small scale chemical and allied industries are treated together such plants are known as common effluent treatment plant cetp the cetp is quite beneficial to small scale industries in terms of space cost of plant operation maintenance technology etc 2 also if the industry is located in the industrial park the effluent from each industry can be collected and treated at cetp of industrial park for better regulation 3 4 in the gujarat state of india many clusters of small scale chemical industries are in existence there are 33 cetps are in operation with total capacity of 575 mld and 7 cetps are under errection and commissioning stage 5 due to the amount of wastewater from industries is steadily increasing every year with the development of chemical and allied industries total suspended solids tss is widely used as one of important parameters of water quality tss adversely affacts the aquatic ecosystems by blocking sunlight and subsequently reduce the photosynsthesis the suspended solids are also responsible as carrier of pollutants like phosphorous mercury heavy metals hydrophobic organic compounds etc 6 primary clarifier is the key process of cetp to remove suspended solids present in the influent the efficiency of the primary clarifier contribute the performance of subsequent processes like secondary clarifier and activated sludge process in the primary clarifier floatable solids scum present in wastewater is removed from the surface using skimmers whereas suspended solids get settled at the bottom of clarifier with the help of flocculants the collected sludge is removed from the bottom and treated water is removed from the top the real time monitoring of various process variables including tss have been gaining more and more importance for better understanding and control of cetp operations 7 the real time monitoring of these variables are quite difficult and only some studies are available to measure and monitor continuously 8 9 in this prevailing situation data driven soft sensors have gained importance in the area of real time monitoring and measurement of key process variables of wastewater treatment plants soft sensors are inferential models which use the data of easily measurable variables to estimate process variables that are hard to measure due to technical limitations need longer analysis time high investment cost etc newhart et al 10 reported a review on data driven performance analysis of wastewater treatment plants in which present status and challenges being faced in development of data driven methods are incorporated mazhar et al 11 reported the prediction of water quality parameters of paper and pulp industrial wastewater using mamdani fuzy logic model a multi layer feed forward neural network mlpnn to monitor total phosphorous is proposed by aguado et al 12 bagheri et al 13 developed radial basis function neural network rbfnn based soft sensor to monitor total phosphorous and nh4 n huang et al 14 proposed integration of data driven soft sensor and the data acquisition and control system further prediction of various pollutants present in the effluent of industrial wastewater treatment plant and process control based on multivariate statistical methods adaptive neural network ann and adaptive network based fuzzy inference system have been reported in the literature 15 20 the work on dynamic and steady state mathematical modelling for the development of controller of primary clarifier have been reported by the researchers 21 27 the soft sensors development for wastewater treatment plant focused on biological process using data driven techniques are reported widely 20 haimi et al 20 reviewed comprehensively about data derived soft sensors for biological wastewater treatment plants the soft sensors for monitoring and control of primary and secondary clarifier of the wastewater treatment plants wwtp are not reported in the literature a number of variants of first principle models are available for the clarifier but its application to the real plants are limited therefore mechanistic model and fuzzy inference system fis based soft sensors for the tss prediction at primary clarifier outlet is proposed in the present study the paper is organised as plant overview fuzzy logic and sedimentation process models in section 2 experiments model parameter identification and simulation results in section 3 and fuzzy inference system model is discussed in section 4 whereas section 5 comprises data collection and error analysis the soft sensor models developed can predict the effluent total suspended solids of clariflocculator by using only influent flow rate and influent total suspended solids as inputs the cetp is operated continuously and have sequence of operations like screening equalization primary clarifier secondary clarifier biological treatment advanced treatments etc tss measurement requires long time under this circumstances if tss of clarifier outlet is predicted using soft sensor like proposed in the present study the operation monitoring and control of subsequent operations would be easy and accurate the mechanistic model also provides the information of total suspended solids present at each layer as well as total suspended solids present in retentate so the sludge generated per day can also be predicted 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment process the common effluent treatment plant consists of various processes like primary secondary and tertiary treatments to remove pollutants from the wastewater cetp vatva located at ahmedabad india is spread in the area of 13 5 km2 having members of 680 industry units out of which 88 are dyes industries the member units scattered in different parts of estate are connected by 92 sump rooms from where wastewater flows by gravity to 6 pumping stations subsequently wastewater is pumped to a cetp for the treatment 28 the cetp consists of sump houses equalization tank flash mixer clariflocculator dissolved air floatation tank aeration tank and secondary clarifier as brief schematic shown in fig 1 the capacity of the plant is 16 mld which can be expanded 25 more two types of flocculants anionic and cationic are used for the enhancement of sedimentation process of clariflocculator the flocculent solution 2000 l day with 0 1 ppm anionic and 1 ppm cationic flocculants are used in the clariflocculator primary clarifier reduces the content of suspended solids and pollutants embedded in the suspended solids the primary clarifier effluent is delivered to activated sludge process asp secondary clarifier and tertiary treatment activated sludge process asp is widely used biological treatment process in domestic as well as in industrial wastewater treatment in biological treatment process organic pollutants are removed by adding microorganism in the bioreactor a continuous flow of oxygen is passed through the bioreactor and the microorganisms use organic matter of wastewater as food and decompose in the sludge the sludge is collected and disposed to land site after further process the secondary clarifier removes flocs of biological growth created by biological treatment process the purpose of the tertiary treatment is to provide a final treatment stage to raise the effluent quality to the desired level it can be accomplished by filtration and reverse osmosis methods 29 2 2 fuzzy logic the fuzzy logic tool is a mathematical tool useful to get solution of uncertainty in which set of fuzzy rules convert inputs to the outputs it uses a specific technique to deal with imprecision and information granularity fuzzy logic provides an inference structure that enables appropriate human reasoning capabilities the basic configuration of a fuzzy system is shown in fig 2 the decision making is an important part in the entire system the fis formulates suitable rules and based upon the rules the decision is made this is mainly based on the concepts of the fuzzy set theory fuzzy if then rules and fuzzy reasoning the fuzzy inference engine algorithm maps the input space x to fuzzy sets in the output space y based on fuzzy logic principles a fuzzy if then rules is a scheme for capturing knowledge and an inference to be made when the rule s condition is partially satisfied 30 the basic fis can take either fuzzy inputs or crisp inputs but the outputs it produces are almost always fuzzy sets when the fis is used as a controller it is necessary to have a crisp output therefore in this case defuzzification method is adopted to extract a crisp value that represents the best fuzzy set there are two types of fuzzy inference methods mamdani and takagi sugeno kang ts the main difference between two methods lies in the consequent of fuzzy rules mamdani fuzzy systems use fuzzy sets as rule consequent whereas ts fuzzy systems employ linear function of input variables as rule consequent 2 3 sedimentation process models most of the continuous sedimentation models are based on the theory introduced by kynch 31 according to which the settling velocity of solid particles depends only on the local suspended solids concentration study of the dynamic model of sedimentation process has been carried out by takacs et al 32 a simulation of complete computational fluid dynamics cfd model has been reported by flamant et al 22 diehl demonstrated the impact of a converging cross sectional area on the concentration 23 fuzzy logic based control for sludge height in secondary settler has been presented by traore et al 33 various settling velocity models of secondary settler have been simulated and sludge settling model was proposed by koehne et al 24 simple mass balance partial difference equation model of continuous settling was described and coupled with the activated sludge model and implemented in matlab simulator by david et al 25 one dimensional model of continuous process with distributed feed was proposed and compared with point source model by nocon 26 automatic system based on fractional density change that estimates total mass of solid present in batch settler before the sedimentation process is finished has been developed by nocon 27 concha et al have developed algorithms and software to determine the material properties of the thickener such as settling velocity of the suspension and compressibility of the sediment produced 34 3 clariflocculator operation experiments and model parameter identification 3 1 clariflocculator operation and mechanistic model clariflocculator is a combination of flocculation and clarification in a single tank it has two concentric tanks where inner tank serves as a flocculation basin and the outer tank serves as a clarifier as shown in fig 3 the flocculated influent wastewater is distributed through central pipe as shown in fig 3 the clear effluent exits from the top of the clarifier tank and accumulated sludge exits from conical bottom of the clarifier where control valve is manually operated at certain interval to remove the sludge in the present work sedimentation tank outer tank is considered for the development of model the performance of the process is monitored by taking wastewater samples at every hour for the measurement of tss bod cod tds toc and nh3 n present in influent as well as effluent sample analysis was carried out in all three shifts of 8 h each and taking average of readings of each shift per day data are presented here the seven layer representation of sedimentation tank is shown in fig 4 where tssin qf qr qe vs and a are influent total suspended solids influent flow rate under flow rate effluent flow rate settling velocity and cross sectional area of the tank respectively under normal operation the range of influent flow rate 800 850 m3 h and total suspended solids 300 600 mg l were observed the ratio of effluent flow rate and under flow rate were 70 and 30 respectively of influent flow rate the mechanistic one dimensional model was developed based on mass conservation law in which a set of ordinary differential equations derived as follows δz is the depth of each layer of the sedimentation tank which are taken as 0 5 m uniformly the velocity constants due to upward and downward flow rate are w and v where w is the ratio of qe a and v is the ratio of qr a the model parameters are v s 1 t o v s 6 1 δ z d t s s 0 d t t s s i n q f a v w t s s 0 v s 1 t s s 1 2 δ z d t s s 1 d t w t s s 0 w v s 1 t s s 1 v s 2 t s s 2 3 δ z d t s s 2 d t w t s s 1 w v s 2 t s s 2 v

qf chosen for the prediction of tsse was based on principle component analysis pca and correlation co efficient it can be seen from table 1 that the effect of various process variables on tsse is marginal whereas tds cod and toc affect each other significantly therefore in the development of soft sensor of tsse the data of two parameters tssin and qf were considered wan et al 19 used pca and correlation co efficient to choose input variables for the development of adaptive network based fuzzy inference system for paper mill wastewater treatment han et al 7 used pca for the selection of input variables to develop data driven intelligent monitoring system for wastewater treatment process for the validation of mechanistic one dimensional model the sedimentation tank as shown in fig 5 is vertically divided into seven layers each having 0 5 m height in order to collect experimental data the samples were collected with the help of peristaltic pump from the sedimentation zone of clariflocculator at various heights as shown in fig 5 and analysis was carried out in laboratory sampling points are s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 as shown in fig 5 movement of solids are only due to gravitational force and fluid flow rate the average values per day of tss at inlet and outlet of the clarifier for two datasets are shown in table 2 experimental analysis for tss carried out for the wastewater samples collected from each layer 0 5 m height of the sedimentation tank is reported in table 3 the model parameters and initial conditions are shown in table 4 the operating conditions were divided in three groups as per the values of qf and tssin as shown in table 5 groups a b c are designated for qf range between 800 to 900 m3 h and tssin range between 300 600 mg l model parameters for each group is shown in table 6 3 3 simulation of mechanistic model the mechanistic one dimensional model was simulated using matlab simulink the simulated tss value at each height of sedimentation tank for dataset i and ii are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively the comparison between simulated and measured tss values along the height of clarifier for data set i and ii are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the residence time of the sedimentation tank was 3 h and by using per day data of influent flow rate and influent total suspended solids the amount of effluent total suspended solids and retentate total suspended solids were extracted the simulation of effluent total suspended solids tsses and retentate total suspended solids tssr are shown for group a b and c in fig 8 a f the measured value of effluent total suspended solid tssem could be comparable with simulation results of effluent total suspended solids but the measured retentate total suspended solids value was not available so validation was not carried out for it however in normal operating conditions the effluent and retentate flow rates are 70 and 30 of the influent flow rate which is measured regularly so the total sludge produced per day can be calculated 4 development of fuzzy inference model the work of fuzzy neural network in wastewater treatment plants is reported by few researchers 15 17 in present work the fuzzy inference system model was built in matlab fuzzy logic toolbox the tssin and qf were considered as input variables and tsse was considered as output variable as per the operating range three models a b and c were developed for each model the operating ranges of qf tssin and tsse were divided in low average and high in terms of gaussian membership function all rules were included in terms of comparing output values in accordance with input values in addition defuzzified results and graphical outputs have been derived fig 9 shows the figures of fuzzy inference system for group a fig 9 a shows the input output mapping for fuzzy inference system fig 9 b illustrates the fuzzy inference system rules derived from compering output values with input values and system operational knowledge fig 9 c shows the defuzzified output tsse for inputs qf 889 m3 h and tssin 376 mg l the values of inputs qf and tssin are entered by the user and the corresponding 3d surface graph is generated which shows the relationship among qf tssin and tsse fig 10 shows the 3d surface responses for group a b and c 5 data collection and error analysis data samples of influent flow rate qf influent tss and effluent tss per day were collected from the plant and divided in the three groups a b and c table 3 with qf range between 800 to 900 m3 h and tssin range between 300 600 mg l after removal of outliers and missing data 324 data points were considered for the error analysis as shown in fig 11 the simulation of effluent total suspended solids was carried out per day basis for mechanistic one dimensional model and fuzzy inference system model the predicted and measured effluent total suspended solids for mechanistic and fuzzy inference system model are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively the mean absolute percentage error mape was used as a performance index to evaluate the prediction capability of the two models the mape 12 4 and 14 9 were observed for one dimensional mechanistic and fuzzy inference system model respectively the observations vs absolute percentage error for both models are shown in fig 14 as per the histogram 78 70 and 76 23 observations fall in less than 20 error in mechanistic and fis model respectively the root mean square error rmse of mechanistic model and fuzzy inference system were 30 and 48 respectively whereas co efficient of determination r2 were 0 84 and 0 5 respectively for the data samples qf ranging from 800 to 900 m3 h and tssin from 300 600 mg l these ranges are typically observed throughout the year at cetp ahmedabad india the percentage mean accuracy for mechanistic model was 88 the difference between predicted and actual measured values of rmse 30 and r2 0 8 of the mechanistic model is reasonable as system is highly sensitive wan et al 19 industry wastewater reported 0 45 r2 for artificial neural network soft sensor for code of paper the similar variation in ph and cod is reported by tan et al 35 using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for palm oil mill effluent treatment the predicted sludge generated per day is shown in fig 15 normally retentate flow rate and solids present in it are not measured in the cetps under this circumstances model developed in present study is useful in predicting these values 6 conclusions the measurement of tss in the wastewater is time consuming and frequent analysis is also required for successful operation of primary clarifier of common effluent treatment plant where quality of inlet wastewater keeps on changing the mechanistic and fuzzy inference system soft sensor models developed in the present study require measurement of influent flow rate and influent total suspended solids only as inputs and can predict the effluent total suspended solids of clariflocculator it makes the operation monitoring and control of subsequent operations of cetp easy and accurate the mechanistic model also provides the information of total suspended solids present at each layer as well as total suspended solids present in retentate so the sludge generated per day can also be predicted the root mean square error rmse of mechanistic model and fuzzy inference system were 30 and 48 respectively the performance of mechanistic model is better than the performance of fuzzy inference system model with 88 percentage mean accuracy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the management and staff members of common effluent treatment plant

parameters for each group is shown in table 6 3 3 simulation of mechanistic model the mechanistic one dimensional model was simulated using matlab simulink the simulated tss value at each height of sedimentation tank for dataset i and ii are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively the comparison between simulated and measured tss values along the height of clarifier for data set i and ii are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the residence time of the sedimentation tank was 3 h and by using per day data of influent flow rate and influent total suspended solids the amount of effluent total suspended solids and retentate total suspended solids were extracted the simulation of effluent total suspended solids tsses and retentate total suspended solids tssr are shown for group a b and c in fig 8 a f the measured value of effluent total suspended solid tssem could be comparable with simulation results of effluent total suspended solids but the measured retentate total suspended solids value was not available so validation was not carried out for it however in normal operating conditions the effluent and retentate flow rates are 70 and 30 of the influent flow rate which is measured regularly so the total sludge produced per day can be calculated 4 development of fuzzy inference model the work of fuzzy neural network in wastewater treatment plants is reported by few researchers 15 17 in present work the fuzzy inference system model was built in matlab fuzzy logic toolbox the tssin and qf were considered as input variables and tsse was considered as output variable as per the operating range three models a b and c were developed for each model the operating ranges of qf tssin and tsse were divided in low average and high in terms of gaussian membership function all rules were included in terms of comparing output values in accordance with input values in addition defuzzified results and graphical outputs have been derived fig 9 shows the figures of fuzzy inference system for group a fig 9 a shows the input output mapping for fuzzy inference system fig 9 b illustrates the fuzzy inference system rules derived from compering output values with input values and system operational knowledge fig 9 c shows the defuzzified output tsse for inputs qf 889 m3 h and tssin 376 mg l the values of inputs qf and tssin are entered by the user and the corresponding 3d surface graph is generated which shows the relationship among qf tssin and tsse fig 10 shows the 3d surface responses for group a b and c 5 data collection and error analysis data samples of influent flow rate qf influent tss and effluent tss per day were collected from the plant and divided in the three groups a b and c table 3 with qf range between 800 to 900 m3 h and tssin range between 300 600 mg l after removal of outliers and missing data 324 data points were considered for the error analysis as shown in fig 11 the simulation of effluent total suspended solids was carried out per day basis for mechanistic one dimensional model and fuzzy inference system model the predicted and measured effluent total suspended solids for mechanistic and fuzzy inference system model are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively the mean absolute percentage error mape was used as a performance index to evaluate the prediction capability of the two models the mape 12 4 and 14 9 were observed for one dimensional mechanistic and fuzzy inference system model respectively the observations vs absolute percentage error for both models are shown in fig 14 as per the histogram 78 70 and 76 23 observations fall in less than 20 error in mechanistic and fis model respectively the root mean square error rmse of mechanistic model and fuzzy inference system were 30 and 48 respectively whereas co efficient of determination r2 were 0 84 and 0 5 respectively for the data samples qf ranging from 800 to 900 m3 h and tssin from 300 600 mg l these ranges are typically observed throughout the year at cetp ahmedabad india the percentage mean accuracy for mechanistic model was 88 the difference between predicted and actual measured values of rmse 30 and r2 0 8 of the mechanistic model is reasonable as system is highly sensitive wan et al 19 industry wastewater reported 0 45 r2 for artificial neural network soft sensor for code of paper the similar variation in ph and cod is reported by tan et al 35 using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for palm oil mill effluent treatment the predicted sludge generated per day is shown in fig 15 normally retentate flow rate and solids present in it are not measured in the cetps under this circumstances model developed in present study is useful in predicting these values 6 conclusions the measurement of tss in the wastewater is time consuming and frequent analysis is also required for successful operation of primary clarifier of common effluent treatment plant where quality of inlet wastewater keeps on changing the mechanistic and fuzzy inference system soft sensor models developed in the present study require measurement of influent flow rate and influent total suspended solids only as inputs and can predict the effluent total suspended solids of clariflocculator it makes the operation monitoring and control of subsequent operations of cetp easy and accurate the mechanistic model also provides the information of total suspended solids present at each layer as well as total suspended solids present in retentate so the sludge generated per day can also be predicted the root mean square error rmse of mechanistic model and fuzzy inference system were 30 and 48 respectively the performance of mechanistic model is better than the performance of fuzzy inference system model with 88 percentage mean accuracy declaration

owing to their advantages in water treatment i e that are mercury free have short warm up times can use specific wavelengths and long life time 26 000 h for emitting at 365 nm 26 moreover the use of uv leds for treating mc lr results in lower electrical energy per order ee o values than those obtained during the operation of low high pressure conventional mercury uv lamps 27 28 furthermore the uv leds development with a longer lifespan and higher intensity has been a great challenge worldwide however only a few studies using such a process have been recently conducted the effects of different uv led wavelengths uva uvb and uvc were first evaluated on mc lr degradation in combination with tio2 29 also degradation of microcystins have been studied using uv leds with tio2 membrane 30 n tio2 31 c n mesoporous tio2 32 however there is no study on treating other cyanotoxins such as antx which is relatively recalcitrant to oxidation with uv leds tio2 process although previous studies have extended the use of uv leds for treating microcystins coupled with tio2 it is necessary to investigate the role of ph and natural organic matter nom concentration and to examine the changes of nom characteristic during the uv led tio2 process using natural water as it has complex factors that affect the potential applicability of cyanotoxin degradation additionally degradation efficiency of quite different structures of cyanotoxins such as mc lr and antx by the uv led tio2 process should be compared to confirm the potential application in water treatment therefore the aim of this study

concentration of nom with mc lr was approximately 1 mg l 1 higher than that of the prepared nom solution as mc lr acts as a carbon source according to the results toc analysis the characteristics of the nom were observed by liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd doc labor germany and excitation emission matrices eems which were obtained using a f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan in excitation and emission ranges of 250 400 sampling interval of 5 nm and 290 540 nm sampling interval of 1 nm respectively the fluorescence index fi was calculated using the ratio of fluorescence intensity emission wavelengths λem at 470 and 520 nm and an excitation wavelength λex of 370 nm 33 the kinetics of the uv led tio2 process were investigated by considering the correlation between ln c c0 and the irradiation time the pseudo first order rate constants k min 1 of the reaction was calculated as follows 5 5 l n c c 0 k t where c0 is the initial mc lr or antx concentration and c is the mc lr or antx concentration during the uv led tio2 process at time t natural river water samples were collected from the han river seoul korea on 28 september 2018 the water quality

polycarbonate whatman england the optimum condition tio2 0 05 g l 1 of the uv led tio2 process was also applied to the natural river water the antx and mc lr degradation efficiencies of the uv led tio2 process were evaluated in both synthetic and natural river water spiked with 1 mg l 1 of antx and mc lr respectively 2 3 analysis of mc lr and antx by lc ms ms the mc lr and antx concentrations

samples of the target toxins were separated using a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 100 mm particle size 1 8 μm agilent usa at 40 c and injection volume of 10 μl the mobile phase composition was water a and acetonitrile b both containing 0 1 formic acid for mc lr at 0 3 ml min 1 of flow rate the acetonitrile gradient began at 10 held for 1 min and then reached 70 with gradual increase for 3 3 min the gradient was them returned to the initial conditions for 0 5 min antx was analyzed under the same gradient except for 0 45 ml min 1of flow rate the detection limits of mc lr and antx were 0 01 μg l 1 by analytical methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tio2 dose prior to investigating the effect of tio2 dose 0 05 0 5 g l 1 on the photocatalytic degradation of mc lr the adsorption of mc lr on the tio2 surface was evaluated under dark condition the adsorption of mc lr was also investigated under different tio2 doses and it was found that mc lr adsorption was negligible so it was not considered the initial mc lr degradation rates were increased proportionally with increasing tio2 dosage and over 99 9 of mc lr was degraded within 5 min at tio2 doses exceeding 0 125 g l 1 fig 2 a at a tio2 dose of 0 05 g l 1 the initial degradation rate was 0 261 min 1 which was sufficient for degrading 99 5 of the mc lr within 15 min although the tio2 concentration gradually increased no significant degradation occurred when the tio2 dose exceeded 0 125 g l 1 as the degradation of mc lr was very rapid within the tio2 dose range of 0 125 0 5 g l 1 the mc lr degradation kinetics were not described well by the pseudo first order reaction as reaction was very rapid in the fig 2b the ee o value of uv led tio2 process with tio2 dose of 0 05 g l 1 for the mc lr removal is estimated as 12 02 kw h l order which is almost one fourth of the ee o value 44 23 kw h l order obtained by uv tio2 process for the mc lr removal also 15 84 kw h l order was required for the antx removal using uv led tio2 process with same tio2 dose while 1 57 times more energy should be spent using uv tio2 process fig 2c moreover in comparison to a previous study 29 that reported an optimal p 25 tio2 concentration of 0 5 g l 1 for treating 1 mg l 1 of mc lr total degradation for 30 min in the uv led tio2 process and li et al 34 showed about 70 degradation of mc lr after 15 min reaction by using tio2 0 05 g l 1 and h2o2 17 mg l 1 under uv irradiation therefore remarkably efficient mc lr removal was observed in this study even with a much lower concentration of tio2 attributed by the high uv led intensity 28 6 mw cm 2 using a conventional uv lamp tio2 process fotiou et al 24 identified the optimal tio2 dose required to achieve the complete degradation of mc lr 10 mg l 1 within 20 min at 71 1 mw cm 2 was 0 2 g l 1 therefore these results demonstrate that using uv leds from lumens in the experiment could achieve the complete degradation of mc lr even with low tio2 doses and uv leds are as effective as uv lamps for treating mc lr furthermore it is cost effective and sufficient for degrading mc lr with a tio2 dose of 0 05 g l 1 thus further experiments were conducted using 0 05 g l 1 of tio2 in the uv led tio2 process 3 2 effect of initial ph the adsorption of mc lr on tio2 at four ph values was also examined prior to experiments then could be ignored the mc lr degradation efficiencies were 19 8 43 8 83 3 and 92 3 for 3 min at ph values of 3 4 5 0 6 5 and 9 0 for the uv led tio2 process respectively as shown in fig 3 under acidic conditions the degradation rate constant of mc lr was 0 731 min 1 and 0 530 min 1 at ph 3 4 and ph 5 0 respectively at almost neutral ph 6 5 the degradation rate constant of mc lr was 0 261 min 1 finally the degradation rate constants of mc lr were decreased by increasing the ph and the lowest constant 0 127 min 1 was observed at ph 8 3 similarly pelaez et al 23 reported that degradation rate of mc lr was the fasted under acidic condition ph 3 using visible light and nitrogen and fluorine doped tio2 these results were attributed by the solution ph which affected the charge of both the mc lr and tio2 the loss of two protons from the mc lr s structure resulted in an overall charge of 1 mc lrh at most ph values 3 0 ph 12 0 35 however the tio2 was positively charged as tioh2 below phpzc 6 25 6 7 p 25 36 37 and negatively charged tio at higher than phpzc 23 as a result at a lower ph acidic condition the surface charges produce higher electrostatic attractive forces between the negatively charged mc lr and positively charged tio2 surface mc lr is then effectively degraded by the ho and o2 generated on the surface of tio2 under uv led irradiation 3 3 effect of nom nom was added to the solution to investigate its influence on the degradation of mc lr and the changes in its characteristics for the uv led tio2 process when nom concentrations were increased to 5 17 0 18 and 10 85 0 26 mg l 1 the degradation rate constant steadily decreased fig 4 as expected mc lr degradation efficiency exceeded 99 9 at a reaction time of 15 min but decreased to 89 0 and 74 3 at nom concentrations of 5 and 10 mg l 1 respectively with 5 and 10 mg l 1 of nom the mc lr degradation rates decreased to 0 144 and 0 113 min 1 respectively indicating that the inhibitory effect of the uv led tio2 process increased with higher nom concentrations owing to the scavenging effect similarly pelaez et al 23 found that degradation rate of mc lr with nom concentrations of 5 and 10 mg l 1 decreased from 2 29 0 04 2 31 0 07 and 2 27 0 07 μm min 1 respectively at ph 5 7 li and hu 38 showed that degradation of ciprofloxacin was greatly decreased by the addition of nom 15 mg l 1 in the uv led tio2 process both previous studies described that nom serves as a scavenger under the steady state concentration of oh oh ss the initial toc concentration of 6 12 0 02 decreased to 2 84 0 64 mg l 1 and 53 6 of toc was degraded by uv led tio2 process within 30 min fig 5 a the initial toc concentration of 11 21 0 20 decreased to 7 29 3 12 mg l 1 therefore 35 0 of toc was degraded the concentration of nom is approximately 5 10 times higher than the initial mc lr concentration and nom competitively consumes more of the radicals generated by the uv led tio2 process fig 5b shows the lc ocd fractions after the uv led tio2 process and the three representative components of nom were defined as humic substance hs building blocks bb and low molecular weight lmw neutrals of these hs was the dominant component 59 5 followed by lmw neutrals 26 8 and lmw acids 10 6 the proportion of hs decreased gradually from 59 5 to 4 2 30 min as the reaction continued however the amount of lmw substances gradually increased as the reaction time increased the proportion of lmw neutrals increased from 26 8 53 9 while lmw acids were not observed in the initial solution but their proportion increased to 14 5 during the reaction the eems fluorescence spectra also support the lc ocd analysis results in the eem contour plot the fluorescence peak λex λem 325 449 nm of the control solution slightly shifted to shorter wavelength λex λem 325 431 nm along with emission after 30 min fig 6 the fluorescence index fi values of the reaction samples were 1 11 1 16 1 23 and 1 34 for 0 5 10 and 20 min respectively which reflected a decrease in the aromaticity these results suggested that the high molecular fraction of nom was degraded to a low molecular fraction with degradation of aromatic moieties by the uv led tio2 process moreover hs plays a major competitor in the consumption of the radicals generated by the uv led tio2 process 3 4 degradation kinetics of the uv led tio2 process in synthetic and natural river water mc lr and antx to consider the practicality of uv led tio2 process the degradation kinetics of mc lr and antx were studied for specific tio2 dose 0 05 g l 1 in natural river water the adsorption of antx on tio2 was ignored as its initial concentration did not significantly change for 3 h under dark conditions similar to the result of mc lr antx efficiently was also degraded in natural river water and the degradation efficiency exceeded 99 0 within 15 min fig 7 a the trends of mc lr and antx were fitted well with pseudo first order kinetic model that their constants k were calculated as 0 266 min 1 and 0 168 min 1 respectively fig 7b compared to other cyanotoxins such as mc lr oxidation of antx is generally more difficult due to molecular structure 38 which has one oxidation site antx is not effectively degraded by chlorine and uv irradiation alone even using uv lamps emitting 254 nm 11 39 41 although degradation efficiency is slightly lower with antx than that of mc lr during uv led tio2 process it can be an effective treatment for the removal of both mc lr and antx the most distinctive feature of natural river water is the presence of nom and alkalinity which are not present in synthetic water natural river water with a toc of 3 12 mg l 1 and alkalinity of 45 mg l 1 as caco3 was used for 120 min in the uv led tio2 process the 1 mg l 1 of mc lr and antx in the natural river water sample was completely degraded after 30 min of reaction and exhibited lower degradation rate constants than those of synthetic water at optimum condition in section 3 3 the increase in nom indicated that mc lr is completely degraded within 10 min although nom acts as an o h scavenger however the reason for the further decrease in the k of mc lr and antx is attributed to alkalinity bicarbonate ion hco3 is predominant in high alkalinity water at ph 7 7 5 which act as scavengers of o h and inhibit the initial degradation rates of cyanotoxins 23 furthermore some tio2 was observed to aggregate in natural river water even after thorough dispersion as the increased gradually increased aggregation of tio2 similarly jefferson et al 42 found that the aggregated tio2 inhibited the reaction of uv tio2 as the surface area of tio2 available for the reaction was reduced as shown in fig s1a and b slight aggregation of tio2 was observed and increasing alkalinity 50 mg l 1 as caco3 reduced the k values of mc lr from 0 261 to 0 038 min 1 fig s1c when the alkalinity of synthetic water was adjusted with the nahco3 solution therefore increasing the alkalinity affects the kinetics of uv led tio2 process resulting in a decrease in the degradation of nom and cyanotoxins the k values of mc lr and antx were calculated by the pseudo first order kinetic model were 0 111 and 0 082 min 1 respectively fig 8 b the amount of nom degradation ranged from 2 82 to 1 98 mg l 1 when the reaction time increased from 0 to 30 min lc ocd analysis indicated that the proportions of hs bb and lmw neutrals in nom 35 9 18 1 and 28 5 respectively after 30 min of uv led irradiation the nom consisted of hs 20 6 bb 36 7 lmw neutrals 30 3 and lmw acid 12 0 fig 8c therefore the uv led tio2 process can effectively remove mc lr and antx from natural river water in spite of the inhibitory effects of nom and alkalinity 4 conclusions in this study mc lr and antx were effectively degraded in both synthetic and natural river water by a combination of commercial tio2 and developed uv leds by lumens south korea the developed uv leds are as effective as conventional mercury uv lamps for treating mc lr attributed to the high uv intensity the effect of tio2 dose ph and nom characteristics on the uv led tio2 process was fully investigated mc lr degradation is a rapid reaction under the uv led tio2 process and the increase in the tio2 dose generally enhanced mc lr degradation the mc lr degradation efficiency was higher under highly acidic condition due to the phzpc of tio2 nom particularly hs acts as and o h scavenger and competing factor resulting in a decrease in the mc lr degradation rate in the river water mc lr and antx degradation were further inhibited by the aggregation of tio2 due to the presence of carbonate ions however mc lr and antx were still efficiently degraded by the uv led tio2 process and the developed uv leds demonstrated their performance as alternative uv light

leds development with a longer lifespan and higher intensity has been a great challenge worldwide however only a few studies using such a process have been recently conducted the effects of different uv led wavelengths uva uvb and uvc were first evaluated on mc lr degradation in combination with tio2 29 also degradation of microcystins have been studied using uv leds with tio2 membrane 30 n tio2 31 c n mesoporous tio2 32 however there is no study on treating other cyanotoxins such as antx which is relatively recalcitrant to oxidation with uv leds tio2 process although previous studies have extended the use of uv leds for treating microcystins coupled with tio2 it is necessary to investigate the role of ph and natural organic matter nom concentration and to examine the changes of nom characteristic during the uv led tio2 process using natural water as it has complex factors that affect the potential applicability of cyanotoxin degradation additionally degradation efficiency of quite different structures of cyanotoxins such as mc lr and antx by the uv led tio2 process should be compared to confirm the potential application in water treatment therefore the aim of this study are to 1 optimize uv led tio2 processes for removing mc lr using tio2 2 compared ee o values of uv led tio2 and uv tio2 processes by examining degradation of mc lr and antx respectively 3 investigate the o h scavenging effects at different ph and nom concentrations 4 characterize the nom variation before and after uv led tio2 process and 5 compare the degradation kinetics of mc lr and antx according to their molecular structure in both synthetic and natural river water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials alglachem inc taiwan supplied mc lr c49h74n10o12 95 while antx c10h15no 98 was

supplied by the international humic substances society ihss 2r101 n usa 2 2 photocatalytic experiments the photocatalytic experiments were conducted in quartz dish reactor volume of 40 ml diameter of 90 mm with mc lr initial conc 1 mg l 1 fig 1 a different tio2 doses 0 05 0 125 0 2 0 25 and 0 5 g l 1 were dispersed in deionized water to determine the optimum tio2 dose by ultra sonication elmasonic p 30h elma germany the dispersed tio2 solution was stirred under dark conditions with mc lr for 3 h to reach the adsorption desorption equilibrium samples were taken at specified times and filtered through a syringe filter 0 2 μm pvdf whatman england to separate the tio2 particles four uv leds 1 6 w λ 365 nm rumens korea were arranged in a circle with an intensity of 28 6 mw cm 2 which was measured using a uva radiometer st 510 century taiwan fig 1b to compare with a conventional uv lamp 4 w λ 365 nm sankyo japan uv tio2 process was conducted with tio2 0 05 g l 1 of for the removal of mc lr and antx and for obtaining ee o values additionally the effect of ph and nom concentration on mc lr degradation by the uv led tio2 process was examined the initial solution ph was adjusted to 3 4 5 0 6 5 and 8 3 with 0 1 m of hcl and naoh the initial nom concentrations were 5 17 0 18 and 10 85 0 26 mg l 1 in deionized water as determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu japan the toc concentration of nom with mc lr was approximately 1 mg l 1 higher than that of the prepared nom solution as mc lr acts as a carbon source according to the results toc analysis the characteristics of the nom were observed by liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd doc labor germany and excitation emission matrices eems which were obtained using a f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan in excitation and emission ranges of 250 400 sampling interval of 5 nm and 290 540 nm sampling interval of 1 nm respectively the fluorescence index fi was calculated using the ratio of fluorescence intensity emission wavelengths λem at 470 and 520 nm and an excitation wavelength λex of 370 nm 33 the kinetics of the uv led tio2 process were investigated by considering the correlation between ln c c0 and the irradiation time the pseudo first order rate constants k min 1 of the reaction was calculated as follows 5 5 l n c c 0 k t where c0 is the initial mc lr or antx concentration and c is the mc lr or antx concentration during the uv led tio2 process at time t natural river water samples were collected from the han river seoul korea on 28 september 2018 the water quality

alkalinity 24443 01 hach usa suva254 uv vis spectrophotometer optizen pop qx korea and turbidity hach usa prior to experiments the water sample was thoroughly filtered on 0 45 μm membrane polycarbonate whatman england the optimum condition tio2 0 05 g l 1 of the uv led tio2 process was also applied to the natural river water the antx and mc lr degradation efficiencies of the uv led tio2 process were evaluated in both synthetic and natural river water spiked with 1 mg l 1 of antx and mc lr respectively 2 3 analysis of mc lr and antx by lc ms ms the mc lr and antx concentrations were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer uhplc ms ms 1290 infinity lc 6460 triple quadrupole ms agilent usa with electrospray ionization esi the degraded samples of the target toxins were separated using a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 100 mm particle size 1 8 μm agilent usa at 40 c and injection volume of 10 μl the mobile phase composition was water a and acetonitrile b both containing 0 1 formic acid for mc lr at 0 3 ml min 1 of flow rate the acetonitrile gradient began at 10 held for 1 min and then reached 70 with gradual increase for 3 3 min the gradient was them returned to the initial conditions for 0 5 min antx was analyzed under the same gradient except for 0 45 ml min 1of flow rate the detection limits of mc lr and antx were 0 01 μg l 1 by analytical methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tio2 dose prior to investigating the effect of tio2 dose 0 05 0 5 g l 1 on the photocatalytic degradation of mc lr the adsorption of mc lr on the tio2 surface was evaluated under dark condition the adsorption of mc lr was also investigated under different tio2 doses and it was found that mc lr adsorption was negligible so it was not considered the initial mc lr degradation rates were increased proportionally with increasing tio2 dosage and over 99 9 of mc lr was degraded within 5 min at tio2 doses exceeding 0 125 g l 1 fig 2 a at a tio2 dose of 0 05 g l 1 the initial degradation rate was 0 261 min 1 which was sufficient for degrading 99 5 of the mc lr within 15 min although the tio2 concentration gradually increased no significant degradation occurred when the tio2 dose exceeded 0 125 g l 1 as the degradation of mc lr was very rapid within the tio2 dose range of 0 125 0 5 g l 1 the mc lr degradation kinetics were not described well by the pseudo first order reaction as reaction was very rapid in the fig 2b the ee o value of uv led tio2 process with tio2 dose of 0 05 g l 1 for the mc lr removal is estimated as 12 02 kw h l order which is almost one fourth of the ee o value 44 23 kw h l order obtained by uv tio2 process for the mc lr removal also 15 84 kw h l order was required for the antx removal using uv led tio2 process with same tio2 dose while 1 57 times more energy should be spent using uv tio2 process fig 2c moreover in comparison to a previous study 29 that reported an optimal p 25 tio2 concentration of 0 5 g l 1 for treating 1 mg l 1 of mc lr total degradation for 30 min in the uv led tio2 process and li et al 34 showed about 70 degradation of mc lr after 15 min reaction by using tio2 0 05 g l 1 and h2o2 17 mg l 1 under uv irradiation therefore remarkably efficient mc lr removal was observed in this study even with a much lower concentration of tio2 attributed by the high uv led intensity 28 6 mw cm 2 using a conventional uv lamp tio2 process fotiou et al 24 identified the optimal tio2 dose required to achieve the complete degradation of mc lr 10 mg l 1 within 20 min at 71 1 mw cm 2 was 0 2 g l 1 therefore these results demonstrate that using uv leds from lumens in the experiment could achieve the complete degradation of mc lr even with low tio2 doses and uv leds are as effective as uv lamps for treating mc lr furthermore it is cost effective and sufficient for degrading mc lr with a tio2 dose of 0 05 g l 1 thus further experiments were conducted using 0 05 g l 1 of tio2 in the uv led tio2 process 3 2 effect of initial ph the adsorption of mc lr on tio2 at four ph values was also examined prior to experiments then could be ignored the mc lr degradation efficiencies were 19 8 43 8 83 3 and 92 3 for 3 min at ph values of 3 4 5 0 6 5 and 9 0 for the uv led tio2 process respectively as shown in fig 3 under acidic conditions the degradation rate constant of mc lr was 0 731 min 1 and 0 530 min 1 at ph 3 4 and ph 5 0 respectively at almost neutral ph 6 5 the degradation rate constant of mc lr was 0 261 min 1 finally the degradation rate constants of mc lr were decreased by increasing the ph and the lowest constant 0 127 min 1 was observed at ph 8 3 similarly pelaez et al 23 reported that degradation rate of mc lr was the fasted under acidic condition ph 3 using visible light and nitrogen and fluorine doped tio2 these results were attributed by the solution ph which affected the charge of both the mc lr and tio2 the loss of two protons from the mc lr s structure resulted in an overall charge of 1 mc lrh at most ph values 3 0 ph 12 0 35 however the tio2 was positively charged as tioh2 below phpzc 6 25 6 7 p 25 36 37 and negatively charged tio at higher than phpzc 23 as a result at a lower ph acidic condition the surface charges produce higher electrostatic attractive forces between the negatively charged mc lr and positively charged tio2 surface mc lr is then effectively degraded by the ho and o2 generated on the surface of tio2 under uv led irradiation 3 3 effect of nom nom was added to the solution to investigate its influence on the degradation of mc lr and the changes in its characteristics for the uv led tio2 process when nom concentrations were increased to 5 17 0 18 and 10 85 0 26 mg l 1 the degradation rate constant steadily decreased fig 4 as expected mc lr degradation efficiency exceeded 99 9 at a reaction time of 15 min but decreased to 89 0 and 74 3 at nom concentrations of 5 and 10 mg l 1 respectively with 5 and 10 mg l 1 of nom the mc lr degradation rates decreased to 0 144 and 0 113 min 1 respectively indicating that the inhibitory effect of the uv led tio2 process increased with higher nom concentrations owing to the scavenging effect similarly pelaez et al 23 found that degradation rate of mc lr with nom concentrations of 5 and 10 mg l 1 decreased from 2 29 0 04 2 31 0 07 and 2 27 0 07 μm min 1 respectively at ph 5 7 li and hu 38 showed that degradation of ciprofloxacin was greatly decreased by the addition of nom 15 mg l 1 in the uv led tio2 process both previous studies described that nom serves as a scavenger under the steady state concentration of oh oh ss the initial toc concentration of 6 12 0 02 decreased to 2 84 0 64 mg l 1 and 53 6 of toc was degraded by uv led tio2 process within 30 min fig 5 a the initial toc concentration of 11 21 0 20 decreased to 7 29 3 12 mg l 1 therefore 35 0 of toc was degraded the concentration of nom is approximately 5 10 times higher than the initial mc lr concentration and nom competitively consumes more of the radicals generated by the uv led tio2 process fig 5b shows the lc ocd fractions after the uv led tio2 process and the three representative components of nom were defined as humic substance hs building blocks bb and low molecular weight lmw neutrals of these hs was the dominant component 59 5 followed by lmw neutrals 26 8 and lmw acids 10 6 the proportion of hs decreased gradually from 59 5 to 4 2 30 min as the reaction continued however the amount of lmw substances gradually increased as the reaction time increased the proportion of lmw neutrals increased from 26 8 53 9 while lmw acids were not observed in the initial solution but their proportion increased to 14 5 during the reaction the eems fluorescence spectra also support the lc ocd analysis results in the eem contour plot the fluorescence peak λex λem 325 449 nm of the control solution slightly shifted to shorter wavelength λex λem 325 431 nm along with emission after 30 min fig 6 the fluorescence index fi values of the reaction samples were 1 11 1 16 1 23 and 1 34 for 0 5 10 and 20 min respectively which reflected a decrease in the aromaticity these results suggested that the high molecular fraction of nom was degraded to a low molecular fraction with degradation of aromatic moieties by the uv led tio2 process moreover hs plays a major competitor in the consumption of the radicals generated by the uv led tio2 process 3 4 degradation kinetics of the uv led tio2 process in synthetic and natural river water mc lr and antx to consider the practicality of uv led tio2 process the degradation kinetics of mc lr and antx were studied for specific tio2 dose 0 05 g l 1 in natural river water the adsorption of antx on tio2 was ignored as its initial concentration did not significantly change for 3 h under dark conditions similar to the result of mc lr antx efficiently was also degraded in natural river water and the degradation efficiency exceeded 99 0 within 15 min fig 7 a the trends of mc lr and antx were fitted well with pseudo first order kinetic model that their constants k were calculated as 0 266 min 1 and 0 168 min 1 respectively fig 7b compared to other cyanotoxins such as mc lr oxidation of antx is generally more difficult due to molecular structure 38 which has one oxidation site antx is not effectively degraded by chlorine and uv irradiation alone even using uv lamps emitting 254 nm 11 39 41 although degradation efficiency is slightly lower with antx than that of mc lr during uv led tio2 process it can be an effective treatment for the removal of both mc lr and antx the most distinctive feature of natural river water is the presence of nom and alkalinity which are not present in synthetic water natural river water with a toc of 3 12 mg l 1 and alkalinity of 45 mg l 1 as caco3 was used for 120 min in the uv led tio2 process the 1 mg l 1 of mc lr and antx in the natural river water sample was completely degraded after 30 min of reaction and exhibited lower degradation rate constants than those of synthetic water at optimum condition in section 3 3 the increase in nom indicated that mc lr is completely degraded within 10 min although nom acts as an o h scavenger however the reason for the further decrease in the k of mc lr and antx is attributed to alkalinity bicarbonate ion hco3 is predominant in high alkalinity water at ph 7 7 5 which act as scavengers of o h and inhibit the initial degradation rates of cyanotoxins 23 furthermore some tio2 was observed to aggregate in natural river water even after thorough dispersion as the increased gradually increased aggregation of tio2 similarly jefferson et al 42 found that the aggregated tio2 inhibited the reaction of uv tio2 as the surface area of tio2 available for the reaction was reduced as shown in fig s1a and b slight aggregation of tio2 was observed and increasing alkalinity 50 mg l 1 as caco3 reduced the k values of mc lr from 0 261 to 0 038 min 1 fig s1c when the alkalinity of synthetic water was adjusted with the nahco3 solution therefore increasing the alkalinity affects the kinetics of uv led tio2 process resulting in a decrease in the degradation of nom and cyanotoxins the k values of mc lr and antx were calculated by the pseudo first order kinetic model were 0 111 and 0 082 min 1 respectively fig 8 b the amount of nom degradation ranged from 2 82 to 1 98 mg l 1 when the reaction time increased from 0 to 30 min lc ocd analysis indicated that the proportions of hs bb and lmw neutrals in nom 35 9 18 1 and 28 5 respectively after 30 min of uv led irradiation the nom consisted of hs 20 6 bb 36 7 lmw neutrals 30 3 and lmw acid 12 0 fig 8c therefore the uv led tio2 process can effectively remove mc lr and antx from natural river water in spite of the inhibitory effects of nom and alkalinity 4 conclusions in this study mc lr and antx were effectively degraded in both synthetic and natural river water by a combination of commercial tio2 and developed uv leds by lumens south korea the developed uv leds are as effective as conventional mercury uv lamps for treating mc lr attributed to the high uv intensity the effect of tio2 dose ph and nom characteristics on the uv led tio2 process was fully investigated mc lr degradation is a rapid reaction under the uv led tio2 process and the increase in the tio2 dose generally enhanced mc lr degradation the mc lr degradation efficiency was higher under highly acidic condition due to the phzpc of tio2 nom particularly hs acts as and o h scavenger and competing factor resulting in a decrease in the mc lr degradation rate in the river water mc lr and antx degradation were further inhibited by the aggregation of tio2 due to the presence of carbonate ions however mc lr and antx were still efficiently degraded by the uv led tio2 process and the developed uv leds demonstrated their performance as alternative uv light sources therefore further research is required to evaluate the removal efficiency of cyanotoxins for treating large volumes of water at field scale experiments declaration of competing interest none

14097,water eutrophication can be controlled through phosphorus adsorption herein ceramsites were used as carriers and feso4 and kmno4 as modifiers to create superior adsorbents for phosphorus after coprecipitation with the modifiers various types of adsorbents were prepared by high temperature combustion the modification process increased the langmuir specific surface areas of the ceramsites which correlated well with the theoretical maximum saturation adsorption amount r 2 0 9275 phosphorus adsorption by the modified ceramsites was consistent with the langmuir isothermal adsorption model the feso4 kmno4 and feso4 kmno4 modified ceramsites exhibited maximum saturation adsorption capacities of 2 444 1 538 and 2 751 mg g respectively while that of the untreated ceramsites was 1 182 mg g the results show that dense nanoparticles of f e 2 o 3 and f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h formed on the feso4 kmno4 modified ceramsites the main phosphorus absorption mechanism was the replacement of hydroxyl groups by phosphate on the fe mn oxide surfaces to form a monodentate and bidentate complex the modified ceramsites had lower phosphorus desorption rates which increased as the initial phosphorus concentration increased the pseudo second order kinetic model was capable of accurately describing the phosphorus adsorption kinetics of the modified ceramsites at higher reaction temperatures the initial adsorption rates iars of various types of ceramsites were increased additionally the modified ceramsites had larger iars than the untreated ceramsite under similar temperature conditions an analysis of the adsorption thermodynamics showed that phosphorus adsorption via ceramsites was a spontaneous and endothermic process keywords modified ceramsites metal oxides phosphorus adsorption capacity desorption rate 1 introduction under normal conditions many bodies of water exist in an equilibrium state however the addition of excessive amounts of elements like nitrogen and phosphorus can cause eutrophication and serious damage 1 2 in the case of excessive phosphorus the resultant eutrophication facilitates the massive propagation of algae 3 such algal blooms can decrease the concentration of dissolved oxygen and reduce the transparency of the water deteriorating water quality and leading to mass mortalities of fish and other organisms 4 5 additionally algae release large amounts of microcystins mcs that can damage human liver cells drinking water that contains mcs can cause chronic or acute poisoning in humans thereby posing a serious threat to drinking water safety 6 therefore the reduction of phosphorus concentrations to acceptable standards is a major environmental issue the typical methods for the dephosphorization of water include chemical 7 ecological 8 9 and adsorption 10 12 methods chemical dephosphorization relies on the application of chemicals such as lime alum or ferric chloride to the affected water body however these methods have high treatment costs and large slug productions ecological dephosphorization involves the construction of artificial wetland ecosystems however the effectiveness of this method varies with the depth of the water season temperature and light exposure making it difficult to achieve stable and high efficiency dephosphorization hence neither chemical or ecological methods are suitable for the dephosphorization of eutrophic water bodies the adsorption method utilizes the superior surface properties and good electrochemical properties of adsorbents 13 after excess phosphorus has been adsorbed it solidifies on the surface of the adsorbent the adsorption desorption method is used to achieve the dual goals of eliminating phosphorus pollution and utilizing phosphorus resources this method has promise for the treatment of eutrophic water bodies amorphous composite metal oxide adsorbent produced by certain chemical reactions and calcination is characterized by a strong phosphorus adsorption capacity however these methods all yield powdery materials 14 16 which are suspended in the water this affects the turbidity of the wastewater such that they are not conducive to long term applications of in situ treatment technologies common clay minerals can sink to the bottom of the water column because they have a certain particle size that can adsorb phosphorus from the overlying water and perform in situ remediation of the sediment these minerals include zeolite 17 medical stone 18 fly ash 19 bentonite 20 and montmorillonite 10 these materials are inexpensive have large yields and good prospects for sewage treatment 21 22 however drawbacks of these clay adsorbents include their relatively small specific surface areas ssas singular adsorption mode and weak phosphorus adsorption capacities ceramsites are a type of high performance adsorbent prepared by processing clay minerals 23 26 ceramsites are porous ceramic granular materials with a closed microporous structure have a good adsorption performance and are easily regenerated for reuse 25 27 studies on the adsorption of phosphorus via reactions among two or more metal salts to form a composite compound have received significant attention 14 28 30 in particular many studies have reported on the feasibility of metal oxides such as manganese and iron oxides as adsorbents for dephosphorization 11 31 metal oxide adsorbents are widely used in wastewater treatment and are typically combined to form composite oxides that exhibit unique physicochemical properties recently a great deal of effort has been placed on the development of adsorbents containing two or more composite compounds 14 28 30 however to date few studies have focused on combining adsorbents with ceramsites to act as carriers for iron and manganese oxides or their composite oxides during the dephosphorization process however there are very few studies on ceramsite modification and applications of new adsorbent materials this new adsorbent material can not only adsorb phosphorus in the overlying water but also has a certain in situ treatment effect 18 20 32 this study is the first step in the in situ remediation of eutrophic water by a new type of adsorbent material this study investigates the feasibility of applying modified ceramsites for dephosphorization specifically ferrous sulfate feso4 and potassium permanganate kmno4 were employed as coprecipitated modifiers and the ceramsites were combusted at high temperatures of 500 900 c the brunauer emmett teller bet ssas langmuir ssas pore sizes and porosity of the modified ceramsites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds isothermal phosphorus adsorption and desorption by the modified ceramsites and their adsorption kinetics models were also studied 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental materials ceramsites were purchased from gongyi yuanquan environmental protection technology co ltd in henan province china all the chemical reagents were purchased from chengdu kelong chemicals co ltd and were of analytical grade all solutions were prepared with deionized water hydrochloric acid hcl feso4 and kmno4 were used as modifiers and potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used to prepare the stock phosphorus solution anhydrous citric acid was used as the desorbent and the ph of the solutions was adjusted using both sodium hydroxide naoh and hcl 2 2 preparation of modified ceramsites ceramsites with a 3 mm particle size were selected for the experiment these particles were repeatedly washed with tap water before being soaked in a 1 mol l hcl solution for 24 h to remove surface impurities the samples were then repeatedly rinsed with distilled water until a ph of 7 was reached followed by oven drying at 100 c before being set aside for later use the performance parameters of the ceramsites are shown in table 1 solutions of 0 2 mol l feso4 and 1 mol l kmno4 were prepared the dried ceramsite was divided into three portions the first and second portions were mixed with feso4 and kmno4 respectively at a volume ratio of 2 1 the third portion was first mixed with kmno4 then feso4 was slowly added during stirring the resulting volume ratio of ceramsite feso4 kmno4 was 2 1 1 the ph was adjusted to neutral using a 4 mol l naoh solution for all three mixtures each sample was stirred for 30 min placed in an oven for drying at 60 c and then set aside for later use each sample was further divided into five portions the samples mixed with feso4 were denoted as f1 f5 f series those mixed with kmno4 were denoted as m1 m5 m series and those mixed with both feso4 and kmno4 were denoted as fm1 fm5 fm series each portion was then placed in a muffle furnace and combusted for 5 h at 500 c portion 1 600 c portion 2 700 c portion 3 800 c portion 4 or 900 c portion 5 after combustion the ceramsites were washed with distilled water oven dried at 60 c and then set aside for later use a sample of untreated unmodified ceramsites was also examined and denoted as tl 2 3 characterization of the materials the microscopic morphology and elemental composition of the ceramsite surfaces were characterized using sem and eds the ceramsite samples were gold sputtered prior to examination a scanning electron microscope hitachi u3010 japan with an edax kevex level 4 eds system was used the bet ssas langmuir ssas pore sizes and porosities were measured by nitrogen adsorption and a asap 2460 surface area analyzer micromeritics co usa xrd analysis was carried out on an

continuous scanning mode a scanning range of 5 85 a 0 02 scanning step length and a scanning speed of 0 2 s ftir spectra were collected on a nicolet is10 ftir transmission spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific co usa samples for ftir determination were ground together with spectral grade kbr in an agate mortar the ir spectra of the original adsorbent and phosphate loaded adsorbent were obtained as dry samples in kbr pellets corresponding to 1 mg of sample in approximately 100 mg of spectral grade dehydrated kbr the zeta potential of the sorbent particles was measured using a nano zeta sizer malvern zetasize nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd at various phs from 3 to 10 in 0 01 m nacl solution at 25 c 2 4 isothermal adsorption potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used to prepare solutions with phosphorus concentrations of 10 100 mg l at 10 mg l intervals samples of each treated ceramsite 3 g were placed in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks before 100 ml of the phosphorus containing solution was added flasks were shaken at 150 r min for 24 h at 15 c upon completion the mixtures were set aside for centrifugation after the supernatants were decanted their phosphorus contents were measured via ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry 2 5 desorption the ceramsites used for isothermal adsorption were washed with 10 ml of absolute ethanol and shaken thoroughly to remove any free phosphate ions this procedure was repeated three times before the samples were washed with distilled water next 100 ml of a 0 5 mmol l citric acid solution was added and the mixture was shaken at 150 r min at 15 c 2 6 adsorption kinetics samples of each type of ceramsite 3 g were placed in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks and a potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution 50 mg l phosphorus concentration was added the flasks were shaken at rate of 150 r min at a sample specific constant temperature of 15 25 35 or 45 c temperature variations were considered to understand the adsorption kinetics of ceramsite driven dephosphorization all experiments were performed using constant temperature water bath shakers sha b yoke instrument china the phosphate concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer v729 yoke instrument china and based on the standard ascorbic acid molybdate blue method 3 results and analysis 3 1 dephosphorization effects of ceramsites the experimental results revealed that the dephosphorization performances of the modified ceramsites were significantly improved in comparison to the untreated ceramsite samples tl as shown in fig 1 the ceramsite based dephosphorization rates increased substantially after modification the f3 m3 and fm2 samples displayed the best dephosphorization efficiencies among their respective series fm2 had the best performance among all three types the fm2 dephosphorization rate reached 72 02 for an initial phosphorus concentration of 100 mg l which was three times that of the tl sample as the initial phosphorus concentration was increased the dephosphorization rates of all ceramsites decreased the maximum and minimum dephosphorization rates for all ceramsites occurred at phosphorus concentrations of 10 and 100 mg l respectively this phenomenon results from adsorption saturation of the ceramsites the number of phosphate molecules increases with the initial phosphorus concentration but the number of adsorption sites on the ceramsite surface remains constant hence the dephosphorization rate declines as the phosphorus concentration increases until adsorption saturation was eventually reached 3 2 surface morphological and elemental changes the surface morphologies and structures of the ceramsites were changed by the modification processes the elemental changes of the modified ceramsites were characterized using eds as shown in fig 1 f3 m3 and fm2 displayed the best dephosphorization performance among the ceramsites in their respective series hence these three ceramsites were used for further investigation into the changes in elemental composition caused by each of the modification conditions their surface morphologies and elemental compositions are shown in fig 2 notably the surface contents of both c and ca decreased significantly upon modification a large amount of fe was attached to the surface of f3 mass fraction of 51 91 the mass fraction of mn on the surface of m3 increased from 0 to 8 95 the fe and mn concentrations on the surface of fm2 increased from 1 59 to 32 81 and 0 8 92 respectively the surface heterogeneities of f3 and fm2 were also reduced the material surfaces exhibited a more uniform state after incorporating a large amount of fe additionally nanosize particles were generated on the surfaces of both f3 and fm2 enhancing their adsorption capacities 33 3 3 bet and langmuir ssas and pore sizes and volumes the adsorption properties of samples are characterized by their bet ssa langmuir ssa pore sizes and porosity the corresponding details of each type of ceramsite are shown in table 2 the difference between the bet and langmuir ssas is the difference in the adsorption amounts for the first adsorbent layer according to the bet theory the adsorbate is adsorbed by multiple layers of the adsorbent s surface instead of adsorbing to a monolayer at the surface even before the adsorbate has entirely covered the first layer the second and third layers of the adsorbent may have initiated the adsorption process therefore the adsorption amount of the first layer is merely a theoretical value within the bet theory in contrast the langmuir theory argues that an adsorbent has a uniform surface and only monolayer adsorption occurs therefore within the langmuir theory the maximum adsorption amount of the single layer represents the theoretical maximum adsorption amount qm the data contained within table 2 indicate that all samples had bet ssas of 20 30 m2 g with the exception of fm1 fm2 and fm3 whose bet ssas were above 30 m2 g in fact the f4 f5 m4 m5 fm4 and fm5 samples all had smaller bet ssas than the tl samples this is likely because of the excessively high temperatures involved in their treatment 800 900 c destroying both the surface and internal pore structures the pore sizes and porosities revealed similar trends to the bet ssas the langmuir ssas of the modified ceramsites varied greatly these values were fitted with respect to their qm values table 3 which were calculated using the langmuir isothermal adsorption model the results of the fitting procedure are shown in fig 3 the fitting correlation r2 was 0 983 indicative of an excellent fit these results verify that the phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites conforms with the langmuir theory that is specific adsorption occurs through a monolayer mechanism 3 4 effects of solution ph solution ph is the most important factor affecting the adsorption process at the solid liquid interface 34 lu et al the rate of phosphorus removal by the different oxide systems is shown as a function of solution ph in fig 4 at ph 3 10 tl exhibited a low phosphorus removal rate 30 since the adsorption mode of tl is very simple and its specific surface area is small the change in ph does not have much effect on the removal rate of phosphorus the removal rate of phosphorus by m3 40 50 is hardly affected by ph because the mn oxide on its surface has a phzpc of 2 and its surface becomes more negative as the ph increases hence its surface was negatively charged at ph 3 10 which resulted in its low removal rate for negatively charged phosphorus in contrast f3 and fm2 had significantly higher phosphorus removal rates the fe oxide on the f3 surface and fe mn oxide on the fm2 surface had phzpc of 7 and 7 5 respectively with an increase in the equilibrium ph uptake of phosphate species decreases 35 36 as the ph increased from 3 to 10 their phosphorus removal rates generally tended to decrease this may be associated with the speciation of phosphorus and the surface charge of the metal oxide 37 as shown in the speciation distribution diagrams of phosphate fig 5 in the ph range of 2 1 7 2 the dominant species is h2po4 whereas between ph 7 2 and 12 3 the main species is hpo4 2 38 thus a higher ph results in more negatively charged phosphate species 39 additionally the surface charge of the metal oxides is also ph dependent when the solution ph is below phzpc the metal oxide has a positively charged surface which can strengthen the anionic phosphate adsorption owing to electrostatic attraction however when the solution ph is above phzpc electrostatic repulsion should occur between the metal oxide and phosphorus 40 42 these two factors might cause the phosphorus removal rate to decrease with an increase of ph interestingly among these ceramsites fm2 displayed the highest phosphorus removal rate it decreased from 92 to 80 as the ph increased from 3 to 10 such a high phosphorus removal rate over a wide ph range is very favorable for practical applications notably the surface charge properties of fm2 are similar to those of hydrous ferric oxide fm2 was not a simple mixture of fe and mn and exhibited different structures to the single component oxides 3 5 adsorption mechanism 3 5 1 xrd fig 6 a shows that tl is composed of c a c o 3 s i o 2 and c a 6 a l 2 s o 4 2 o h 12 26 h 2 o ettringite in fig 3b after tl adsorption of phosphorus c a 6 a l 2 s o 4 2 o h 12 26 h 2 o removed the c a s o 4 and formed another c a a l o x i d e c a a l 2 s i 2 o 8 4 h 2 o the solubility product of c a s o 4 was much smaller than the solubility product of c a 3 p o 4 2 such that c a s o 4 produces a c a 3 p o 4 2 with a smaller solubility product in the phosphorus solution however as the content is small the adsorption effect of the tl is limited the fm2 surface was mainly f e 2 o 3 and a m o r p h o u s f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h fig 3c numerous studies have pointed out that f e 2 o 3 has a strong phosphorus adsorption capacity 14 28 30 from fig 6d we observe that the spectrum of f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h disappeared after adsorption indicating that f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h participates in the adsorption reaction of phosphorus 28 phosphorus adsorption onto the fm2 can be attributed to the replacement of surface hydroxyl groups via the formation of monodentate and bidentate complexes 3 5 2 ftir fourier transform infrared ftir analysis was carried out in the range of 600 3600 cm 1 to identify different functional groups on the fm2 and tl surface fig 7 represents an infrared spectrum of fm2 and tl in which the bands at wavenumbers 3429 and 1624 c m 1 were attributed to the stretching and bending vibrations of oh in the adsorbed water 28 the bands at 460 and 548 c m 1 were attributed to the fe o bond therefore the transmittance of the ferrite bond of the modified ceramsite was enhanced in figs 7a and b the intermediate frequency region at 1037 c m 1 was attributed to the vibration absorption region of the si o bond moreover the absorption peak of c o 3 2 was observed at 1 427 c m 1 which was uniquely characteristic of unaltered ceramsite the bands at 1110 c m 1 and 1155 c m 1 were attributed to the vibration of the metal oxide hydroxyl groups moh 14 28 finally 43 fig 7c and d show an infrared spectrum of the surface material of the iron manganese modified ceramsites after adsorption in which there was a decrease in the transmittance at 1110 c m 1 and 1155 c m 1 indicating that the metal oxide hydroxyl groups moh were weakened this can be attributed to moh group depletion due to reactions with phosphate to form monodentate and bidentate phosphate complexes 28 which led to an increase in transmittance 3 6 isothermal adsorption the phosphorus adsorption process by ceramsites mainly conforms to the langmuir and freundlich isotherm adsorption models the langmuir model is based on monolayer adsorption and theorizes that the adsorbate is uniformly and specifically adsorbed onto the adsorbent s surface with a maximum saturation adsorption amount qm 44 47 qm is calculated as follows 48 1 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where ce is the equilibrium adsorption concentration mg l qe is the equilibrium adsorption amount mg g qm is the theoretical maximum saturation adsorption amount mg g and kl is the langmuir adsorption constant which is related to the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate 2 49 kl and qe can be determined using a linear fitting of ce qe and ce fig 8 shows the langmuir isothermal adsorption curves for each of the ceramsite sample types fig 9 is the linearized model of the langmuir isotherm adsorption curves 50 the langmuir adsorption isotherm equations and correlation coefficients for phosphorus adsorption by the untreated and modified ceramsites are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the correlations captured by the fitting equations were good the r2 values of all the equations were greater than 0 99 51 except for m5 and fm1 for the various series of ceramsites the qm of f3 fm2 and m3 achieved maximum values at 2 44 2 751 and 1 567 mg g respectively for the fm series the qm value increased from 2 236 to 2 751 mg l with the corresponding k value increasing from 0 135 to 0 260 analyses revealed a positive correlation between qm and kl 50 52 it can be seen from table 3 that similar patterns existed for both the f and m series it can be concluded that the affinity between the absorbent and absorbate strengthens as the qm value of the adsorbent increases the langmuir equilibrium adsorption constant rl is a dimensionless separation factor and may be calculated by 53 2 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 is the initial phosphate concentration it can be noted from table 4 that the different rl values represent different adsorption types all modified ceramsites had favorable phosphorus adsorption values as their rl values ranged from 0 to 1 table 5 additionally the rl of all the modified ceramsites were smaller than those of the tl sample indicating that the modification facilitated phosphorus adsorption 54 the adsorption isotherm assumes that intermolecular forces decrease rapidly with distance and consequently predicts the existence of a monolayer of adsorbate at the outer surface of the adsorbent it also assumes that adsorption takes place at specific sites within the adsorbent it is believed that once the adsorbate occupies a site no further adsorption takes place at that site 47 the freundlich isothermal adsorption model represented by an empirical equation eq 3 hypothesizes that adsorption by an adsorbent occurs unevenly and simultaneously across multiple layers eliminating the existence of maximum saturation adsorption 2 55 3 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where ce is the equilibrium adsorption concentration mg l qe is the equilibrium adsorption amount mg g kf and 1 n are freundlich constants and n is a dimensionless parameter a linear fitting was performed with a logarithmic equation to determine the freundlich constant of each ceramsite type fig 10 the freundlich adsorption isothermal equations and correlation coefficients for phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites are shown in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the correlations of the freundlich fitting equations were good reaching r2 values of 0 9 or greater however these r2 values were lower than those of the langmuir model therefore phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites conforms better to the langmuir adsorption isothermal model i e monolayer and specific adsorption the kf value indicates the ability or lack thereof of a material to adsorb phosphorus theoretically a larger kf value is indicative of a stronger adsorption capacity 53 the kf value of the tl samples was only 0 01 in comparison the kf values of f3 m3 and fm2 the highest for their respective series were 0 324 0 315 and 0 440 respectively f3 m3 and fm2 had the strongest adsorption capacities among their series these results were similar to the trends observed for the qm values using the langmuir equations the n value is a constant related to adsorption strength and surface heterogeneity 53 usually smaller n values indicate that a material has a better phosphorus adsorption capacity from table 6 it can be seen that the larger the kf value the smaller the corresponding n value this indicates that the easy absorption of phosphorus by the modified ceramsites is caused by their adsorption capacities 2 3 7 isothermal desorption in water excessive phosphorus will cause eutrophication however phosphorus deficiency also affects the growth of aquatic life and destroys the ecological balance when ceramsites are used to treat wastewater their surfaces contain large amounts of phosphorus this phosphorus can later be desorbed in water bodies characterized by phosphorus deficiency however this may cause secondary environmental pollution and facilitate the growth of undesirable organisms 56 plant roots secrete low molecular weight organic acids when exposed to the stresses of phosphorus deficiency this promotes their use of insoluble phosphorus to maintain normal physiological activities 57 in scenarios where ceramsites are used within lakes and ecological wetlands acids and alkalis cannot be directly added to instigate the desorption of phosphorus from the ceramsites doing so would cause secondary pollution of the ecological environment when the low molecular weight organic acids have accumulated to a specific extent they would compete with phosphates for complexation sites on the surface of the ceramsites thereby reducing the phosphorus adsorption potential citric acid is a common plant root exudate which was used in this study as a desorbent at a concentration of 5 mmol l 58 although many adsorbents have large adsorption capacities the corresponding desorption rates are also high for all the modified ceramsites in this study the desorption rates were less than 10 as shown in fig 11 a for comparison the desorption rate of the tl sample was 19 the trend of desorption rates for the series was m f fm f3 m3 and fm2 had the largest desorption rates among their respective series with fm2 having the largest desorption rate overall at 8 2 its adsorption capacity was also the largest among all the materials examined herein at 2 7 mg g these three treated ceramsites were selected for further investigation of desorption rates under different initial phosphorus concentrations 10 50 and 100 mg l it can be seen from fig 11b that the desorption rate increased as the initial phosphorus concentration increased 3 8 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics pseudo second order pso kinetics and the elovich equation were both used to predict adsorption mechanisms of the ceramsites the equation for pso kinetics is 59 61 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt is the adsorption amount at time t min mg g and k2 is a constant for the adsorption rate of the pso model g mg min the values of qe and k2 can be obtained from the slope and intercept of t qt versus t respectively as shown in fig 12 the initial adsorption rate iar h mg g min can be expressed as 2 5 h k 2 q e 2 table 7 and fig 12 demonstrate that the pso kinetics accurately described the kinetics of phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites at different temperatures the correlation r2 of all fitted equations were greater than 0 98 this indicates that the kinetics of ceramsite dephosphorization follows the pso model as the temperature was increased the qm of f3 fm2 m3 and tl also gradually increased fig 13 shows that the iar of phosphorus also increased in proportion with the temperature and that fm2 had the largest iar under all temperature conditions at a reaction temperature of 45 c the iar of fn2 was 0 011 mg g min which corresponds to a fivefold increase over that of tl therefore raising the temperature promoted phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites doing so not only increased the adsorption capacity but also the values of iars the elovich equation can be used to accurately describe pso kinetics it is semi empirical and does not stipulate any particular adsorption mechanism between the adsorbent and adsorbate however the elovich equation is excellent for fitting irregular data 2 62 the elovich equation is 63 64 6 q t ln a e b e b e 1 b e l n t where ae and be are constants of the elovich equation and are obtained from the slope and intercept of qt versus ln t ae is representative of the iar and be is a constant related to both the surface coverage and the surface activation energy of the adsorbent since the ceramsites have complex surface compositions their surface activation energies can vary greatly the elovich equation is highly suitable to describe processes involving substantial changes in activation energies 31 the applicability of the simple elovich equation to our current kinetics data is consistent with the results of other researchers that is the elovich equation describes the adsorption kinetics of phosphates on soil and soil minerals well 31 65 the kinetic constants of the elovich equation are listed in table 8 and the linear fittings between qt and ln t are shown in fig 14 it can be seen from table 8 that both ae and be vary with temperature when the temperature was increased from 25 to 45 c the ae of f3 m3 fm2 and tl increased from 0 00436 to 0 01189 0 00569 to 0 00878 0 00982 to 0 02129 and 0 00274 to 0 00449 respectively for the same temperature increase the be of f3 m3 fm2 and tl decreased from 4 513 to 2 687 4 219 to 3 221 3 052 to 2 333 and 4 490 to 3 384 respectively raising the temperature increased the iar of the ceramsites for phosphorus which is consistent with conclusions drawn from the pso kinetics model the process and mechanism of phosphorus sorption by the ceramsites was further investigated by calculating the adsorption thermodynamics data based on the following equations 2 47 66 7 δ g δ h t δ s 8 δ g r t ln k z 9 ln k z δ h r t δ s r 10 ln k 2 e a r t c where δg represents the gibbs free energy kj mol δh is the change in enthalpy kj mol δs is the change in entropy j mol k r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the absolute temperature k and ea is the activation energy of adsorption k mol in particular kz is an equilibrium constant associated with the langmuir constant b by kz b 5 55 where 55 5 corresponds to the molar concentration of solvent water plotting ln k2 against 103 t provides the apparent activation energy ea the magnitude of the activation energy is mainly used to determine whether the adsorption is physical or chemical physical adsorption typically requires an activation energy of 5 40 kj mol while chemical adsorption requires a higher activation energy of 40 800 kj mol 67 68 the activation energy values listed in table 9 indicate that the adsorption of phosphorus onto the ceramsites is a physical process the activation energies of phosphorus adsorption for f3 m3 fm2 were all larger than that of tl which can be attributed to an energy barrier that was introduced during modification of the ceramsites 2 it is likely that the fe and mn oxides on the surfaces of the f3 m3 and fm2 ceramsites form complexes with phosphate in water due to hydroxylation δh and δs can be obtained as the slope and intercept of the linear fitted line of ln kz and 1 t respectively the negative values of δg as listed in table 10 suggests that the reaction was spontaneous 69 with an increase in reaction temperature the δg of phosphorus adsorption by fm2 decreased from 0 566 to 1 270 kj mol while that by tl decreased from 0 062 to 0 167 kj mol these data show that the reaction became more spontaneous with an increase in reaction temperature phosphorus adsorption was significantly more spontaneous for fm2 f3 and m2 than for tl the positive values of δh in table 10 indicate that the reaction was endothermic with the reaction heat of the modified ceramsites larger than that of the tl sample this is because the fe mn oxides are hydroxylated in water to form complexes with phosphate which requires the absorption of more heat the positive values of δs in table 10 indicate the good affinity between the absorbate and adsorbent as well as an increase in the randomness of the solid liquid interface during adsorption 47 δs was larger for the modified ceramsites than for the tl sample indicating that there was greater affinity between phosphate and the fe and mn oxides that adhered to the surface of the modified ceramsites in conclusion fm2 is the best of all the ceramsites tested a comparative evaluation of the adsorption capacities of various low cost adsorbents for phosphorus species is provided in table 11 this comparison clearly indicates that the modified ceramsites are effective adsorbents for phosphorus removal 4 conclusions in this study ceramsites with a 3 mm particle size were used as carriers and feso4 and kmno4 were used as modifiers for coprecipitation after combustion at high temperatures 500 900 c 15 types of modified ceramsites were obtained for the dephosphorization of water samples the samples were characterized by bet ssa analysis sem eds xrd ftir and zeta potential analysis and isothermal adsorption and desorption experiments were performed to identify the adsorption characteristics the following conclusions were drawn i the freshly formed fm2 suspension synthesized by an oxidation and coprecipitation method exhibited the highest selective adsorption capability toward phosphate compared to fm2 and their simple oxide i e f3 and m3 the surface of the fm2 particles were rough and nanostructured ii the results show that dense nanoparticles of f e 2 o 3 and f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h formed on the fm2 the main phosphorus absorption mechanism was the replacement of hydroxyl groups by phosphate on the fe mn oxide surfaces to form a monodentate and bidentate complex iii phosphorus adsorption by the fm series of ceramsites was consistent with the langmuir isothermal adsorption model fm2 had the highest saturation adsorption capacities at 2 751 mg g in comparison the maximum saturation adsorption capacity of the untreated tl ceramsite was 1 182 mg g fm2 displayed the highest phosphorus removal rate it decreased from 92 to 80 as the ph increased from 3 to 10 such a high phosphorus removal rate over a wide ph range is very favorable for practical applications iv the pso model accurately described the phosphorus adsorption kinetics of the modified ceramsites as the reaction temperature increased from 15 to 45 c the iars of the ceramsites increased under the same temperatures the modified ceramsites displayed larger iars than the tl sample adsorption thermodynamics data showed that phosphorus adsorption by ceramsites was a spontaneous endothermic reaction where increases in the temperature were conducive to phosphorus adsorption v fm2 can be applied to the in situ remediation of eutrophic water our future studies will explore the application of modified ceramsites to eutrophic water treatment at present our research has entered its second stage the adsorption performance of modified ceramsites on sediment phosphorus in all fractions declaration of competing interest none acknowledgment this research was supported by the major scientific and technological special program of

14097,water eutrophication can be controlled through phosphorus adsorption herein ceramsites were used as carriers and feso4 and kmno4 as modifiers to create superior adsorbents for phosphorus after coprecipitation with the modifiers various types of adsorbents were prepared by high temperature combustion the modification process increased the langmuir specific surface areas of the ceramsites which correlated well with the theoretical maximum saturation adsorption amount r 2 0 9275 phosphorus adsorption by the modified ceramsites was consistent with the langmuir isothermal adsorption model the feso4 kmno4 and feso4 kmno4 modified ceramsites exhibited maximum saturation adsorption capacities of 2 444 1 538 and 2 751 mg g respectively while that of the untreated ceramsites was 1 182 mg g the results show that dense nanoparticles of f e 2 o 3 and f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h formed on the feso4 kmno4 modified ceramsites the main phosphorus absorption mechanism was the replacement of hydroxyl groups by phosphate on the fe mn oxide surfaces to form a monodentate and bidentate complex the modified ceramsites had lower phosphorus desorption rates which increased as the initial phosphorus concentration increased the pseudo second order kinetic model was capable of accurately describing the phosphorus adsorption kinetics of the modified ceramsites at higher reaction temperatures the initial adsorption rates iars of various types of ceramsites were increased additionally the modified ceramsites had larger iars than the untreated ceramsite under similar temperature conditions an analysis of the adsorption thermodynamics showed that phosphorus adsorption via ceramsites was a spontaneous and endothermic process keywords modified ceramsites metal oxides phosphorus adsorption capacity desorption rate 1 introduction under normal conditions many bodies of water exist in an equilibrium state however the addition of excessive amounts of elements like nitrogen and phosphorus can cause eutrophication and serious damage 1 2 in the case of excessive phosphorus the resultant eutrophication facilitates the massive propagation of algae 3 such algal blooms can decrease the concentration of dissolved oxygen and reduce the transparency of the water deteriorating water quality and leading to mass mortalities of fish and other organisms 4 5 additionally algae release large amounts of microcystins mcs that can damage human liver cells drinking water that contains mcs can cause chronic or acute poisoning in humans thereby posing a serious threat to drinking water safety 6 therefore the reduction of phosphorus concentrations to acceptable standards is a major environmental issue the typical methods for the dephosphorization of water include chemical 7 ecological 8 9 and adsorption 10 12 methods chemical dephosphorization relies on the application of chemicals such as lime alum or ferric chloride to the affected water body however these methods have high treatment costs and large slug productions ecological dephosphorization involves the construction of artificial wetland ecosystems however the effectiveness of this method varies with the depth of the water season temperature and light exposure making it difficult to achieve stable and high efficiency dephosphorization hence neither chemical or ecological methods are suitable for the dephosphorization of eutrophic water bodies the adsorption method utilizes the superior surface properties and good electrochemical properties of adsorbents 13 after excess phosphorus has been adsorbed it solidifies on the surface of the adsorbent the adsorption desorption method is used to achieve the dual goals of eliminating phosphorus pollution and utilizing phosphorus resources this method has promise for the treatment of eutrophic water bodies amorphous composite metal oxide adsorbent produced by certain chemical reactions and calcination is characterized by a strong phosphorus adsorption capacity however these methods all yield powdery materials 14 16 which are suspended in the water this affects the turbidity of the wastewater such that they are not conducive to long term applications of in situ treatment technologies common clay minerals can sink to the bottom of the water column because they have a certain particle size that can adsorb phosphorus from the overlying water and perform in situ remediation of the sediment these minerals include zeolite 17 medical stone 18 fly ash 19 bentonite 20 and montmorillonite 10 these materials are inexpensive have large yields and good prospects for sewage treatment 21 22 however drawbacks of these clay adsorbents include their relatively small specific surface areas ssas singular adsorption mode and weak phosphorus adsorption capacities ceramsites are a type of high performance adsorbent prepared by processing clay minerals 23 26 ceramsites are porous ceramic granular materials with a closed microporous structure have a good adsorption performance and are easily regenerated for reuse 25 27 studies on the adsorption of phosphorus via reactions among two or more metal salts to form a composite compound have received significant attention 14 28 30 in particular many studies have reported on the feasibility of metal oxides such as manganese and iron oxides as adsorbents for dephosphorization 11 31 metal oxide adsorbents are widely used in wastewater treatment and are typically combined to form composite oxides that exhibit unique physicochemical properties recently a great deal of effort has been placed on the development of adsorbents containing two or more composite compounds 14 28 30 however to date few studies have focused on combining adsorbents with ceramsites to act as carriers for iron and manganese oxides or their composite oxides during the dephosphorization process however there are very few studies on ceramsite modification and applications of new adsorbent materials this new adsorbent material can not only adsorb phosphorus in the overlying water but also has a certain in situ treatment effect 18 20 32 this study is the first step in the in situ remediation of eutrophic water by a new type of adsorbent material this study investigates the feasibility of applying modified ceramsites for dephosphorization specifically ferrous sulfate feso4 and potassium permanganate kmno4 were employed as coprecipitated modifiers and the ceramsites were combusted at high temperatures of 500 900 c the brunauer emmett teller bet ssas langmuir ssas pore sizes and porosity of the modified ceramsites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds isothermal phosphorus adsorption and desorption by the modified ceramsites and their adsorption kinetics models were also studied 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental materials ceramsites were purchased from gongyi yuanquan environmental protection technology

acid hcl feso4 and kmno4 were used as modifiers and potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used to prepare the stock phosphorus solution anhydrous citric acid was used as the desorbent and the ph of the solutions was adjusted using both sodium hydroxide naoh and hcl 2 2 preparation of modified ceramsites ceramsites with a 3 mm particle size were selected for the experiment these particles were repeatedly washed with tap water before being soaked in a 1 mol l hcl solution for 24 h to remove surface impurities the samples were then repeatedly rinsed with distilled water until a ph of 7 was reached followed by oven drying at 100 c before being set aside for later use the performance parameters of the ceramsites are shown in table 1 solutions of 0 2 mol l feso4 and 1 mol l kmno4 were prepared the dried ceramsite was divided into three portions the first and second portions were mixed with feso4 and kmno4 respectively at a volume ratio of 2 1 the third portion was first mixed with kmno4 then feso4 was slowly added during stirring the resulting volume ratio of ceramsite feso4 kmno4 was 2 1 1 the ph was adjusted to neutral using a 4 mol l naoh solution for all three mixtures each sample was stirred for 30 min placed in an oven for drying at 60 c and then set aside for later use each sample was further divided into five portions the samples mixed with feso4 were denoted as f1 f5 f series those mixed with kmno4 were denoted as m1 m5 m series and those mixed with both feso4 and kmno4 were denoted as fm1 fm5 fm series each portion was then placed in a muffle furnace and combusted for 5 h at 500 c portion 1 600 c portion 2 700 c portion 3 800 c portion 4 or 900 c portion 5 after combustion the ceramsites were washed with distilled water oven dried at 60 c and then set aside for later use a sample of untreated unmodified ceramsites was also examined and denoted as tl 2 3 characterization of the materials the microscopic morphology and elemental composition of the ceramsite surfaces were characterized using sem and eds the ceramsite samples were gold sputtered prior to examination a scanning electron microscope hitachi u3010 japan with an edax kevex level 4 eds

zeta sizer malvern zetasize nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd at various phs from 3 to 10 in 0 01 m nacl solution at 25 c 2 4 isothermal adsorption potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used to prepare solutions with phosphorus concentrations of 10 100 mg l at 10 mg l intervals samples of each treated ceramsite 3 g were placed in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks before 100 ml of the phosphorus containing solution was added flasks were shaken at 150 r min for 24 h at 15 c upon completion the mixtures were set aside for centrifugation after the supernatants were decanted their phosphorus contents were measured via ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry 2 5 desorption the ceramsites used for isothermal adsorption were washed with 10 ml of absolute ethanol and shaken thoroughly to remove any free phosphate ions this procedure was repeated three times before the samples were washed with distilled water next 100 ml of a 0 5 mmol l citric acid solution was added and the mixture was shaken at 150

added the flasks were shaken at rate of 150 r min at a sample specific constant temperature of 15 25 35 or 45 c temperature variations were considered to understand the adsorption kinetics of ceramsite driven dephosphorization all experiments were performed using constant temperature water bath shakers sha b yoke instrument china the phosphate concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer v729 yoke instrument china and based on the standard ascorbic acid molybdate blue method 3 results and analysis 3 1 dephosphorization effects of ceramsites the experimental results revealed that the dephosphorization performances of the modified ceramsites were significantly improved in comparison to the untreated ceramsite samples tl as shown in fig 1 the ceramsite based dephosphorization rates increased substantially after modification the f3 m3 and fm2 samples displayed the best dephosphorization efficiencies among their respective series fm2 had the best performance among all three types the fm2 dephosphorization rate reached 72 02 for an initial phosphorus concentration of 100 mg l which was three times that of the tl sample as the initial phosphorus concentration was increased the dephosphorization rates of all ceramsites decreased the maximum and minimum dephosphorization rates for all ceramsites occurred at phosphorus concentrations of 10 and 100 mg l respectively this phenomenon results from adsorption saturation of the ceramsites the number of phosphate molecules increases with the initial phosphorus concentration but the number of adsorption sites on the ceramsite surface remains constant hence the dephosphorization rate declines as the phosphorus concentration increases until adsorption saturation was eventually reached 3 2 surface morphological and elemental changes the surface morphologies and structures of the ceramsites were changed by the modification processes the elemental changes of the modified ceramsites were characterized using eds as shown in fig 1 f3 m3 and fm2 displayed the best dephosphorization performance among the ceramsites in their respective series hence these three ceramsites were used for further investigation into the changes in elemental composition caused by each of the modification conditions their surface morphologies and elemental compositions are shown in fig 2 notably the surface contents of both c and ca decreased significantly upon modification a large amount of fe was attached to the surface of f3 mass fraction of 51 91 the mass fraction of mn on the surface of m3 increased from 0 to 8 95 the fe and mn concentrations on the surface of fm2 increased from 1 59 to 32 81 and 0 8 92 respectively the surface heterogeneities of f3 and fm2 were also reduced the material surfaces exhibited a more uniform state after incorporating a large amount of fe additionally nanosize particles were generated on the surfaces of both f3 and fm2 enhancing their adsorption capacities 33 3 3 bet and langmuir ssas and pore sizes and volumes the adsorption properties of samples are characterized by their bet ssa langmuir ssa pore sizes and porosity the corresponding details of each type of ceramsite are shown in table 2 the difference between the bet and langmuir ssas is the difference in the adsorption amounts for the first adsorbent layer according to the bet theory the adsorbate is adsorbed by multiple layers of the adsorbent s surface instead of adsorbing to a monolayer at the surface even before the adsorbate has entirely covered the first layer the second and third layers of the adsorbent may have initiated the adsorption process therefore the adsorption amount of the first layer is merely a theoretical value within the bet theory in contrast the langmuir theory argues that an adsorbent has a uniform surface and only monolayer adsorption occurs therefore within the langmuir theory the maximum adsorption amount of the single layer represents the theoretical maximum adsorption amount qm the data contained within table 2 indicate that all samples had bet ssas of 20 30 m2 g with the exception of fm1 fm2 and fm3 whose bet ssas were above 30 m2 g in fact the f4 f5 m4 m5 fm4 and fm5 samples all had smaller bet ssas than the tl samples this is likely because of the excessively high temperatures involved in their treatment 800 900 c destroying both the surface and internal pore structures the pore sizes and porosities revealed similar trends to the bet ssas the langmuir ssas of the modified ceramsites varied greatly these values were fitted with respect to their qm values table 3 which were calculated using the langmuir isothermal adsorption model the results of the fitting procedure are shown in fig 3 the fitting correlation r2 was 0 983 indicative of an excellent fit these results verify that the phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites conforms with the langmuir theory that is specific adsorption occurs through a monolayer mechanism 3 4 effects of solution ph solution ph is the most important factor affecting the adsorption process at the solid liquid interface 34 lu et al the rate of phosphorus removal by the different oxide systems is shown as a function of solution ph in fig 4 at ph 3 10 tl exhibited a low phosphorus removal rate 30 since the adsorption mode of tl is very simple and its specific surface area is small the change in ph does not have much effect on the removal rate of phosphorus the removal rate of phosphorus by m3 40 50 is hardly affected by ph because the mn oxide on its surface has a phzpc of 2 and its surface becomes more negative as the ph increases hence its surface was negatively charged at ph 3 10 which resulted in its low removal rate for negatively charged phosphorus in contrast f3 and fm2 had significantly higher phosphorus removal rates the fe oxide on the f3 surface and fe mn oxide on the fm2 surface had phzpc of 7 and 7 5 respectively with an increase in the equilibrium ph uptake of phosphate species decreases 35 36 as the ph increased from 3 to 10 their phosphorus removal rates generally tended to decrease this may be associated with the speciation of phosphorus and the surface charge of the metal oxide 37 as shown in the speciation distribution diagrams of phosphate fig 5 in the ph range of 2 1 7 2 the dominant species is h2po4 whereas between ph 7 2 and 12 3 the main species is hpo4 2 38 thus a higher ph results in more negatively charged phosphate species 39 additionally the surface charge of the metal oxides is also ph dependent when the solution ph is below phzpc the metal oxide has a positively charged surface which can strengthen the anionic phosphate adsorption owing to electrostatic attraction however when the solution ph is above phzpc electrostatic repulsion should occur between the metal oxide and phosphorus 40 42 these two factors might cause the phosphorus removal rate to decrease with an increase of ph interestingly among these ceramsites fm2 displayed the highest phosphorus removal rate it decreased from 92 to 80 as the ph increased from 3 to 10 such a high phosphorus removal rate over a wide ph range is very favorable for practical applications notably the surface charge properties of fm2 are similar to those of hydrous ferric oxide fm2 was not a simple mixture of fe and mn and exhibited different structures to the single component oxides 3 5 adsorption mechanism 3 5 1 xrd fig 6 a shows that tl is composed of c a c o 3 s i o 2 and c a 6 a l 2 s o 4 2 o h 12 26 h 2 o ettringite in fig 3b after tl adsorption of phosphorus c a 6 a l 2 s o 4 2 o h 12 26 h 2 o removed the c a s o 4 and formed another c a a l o x i d e c a a l 2 s i 2 o 8 4 h 2 o the solubility product of c a s o 4 was much smaller than the solubility product of c a 3 p o 4 2 such that c a s o 4 produces a c a 3 p o 4 2 with a smaller solubility product in the phosphorus solution however as the content is small the adsorption effect of the tl is limited the fm2 surface was mainly f e 2 o 3 and a m o r p h o u s f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h fig 3c numerous studies have pointed out that f e 2 o 3 has a strong phosphorus adsorption capacity 14 28 30 from fig 6d we observe that the spectrum of f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h disappeared after adsorption indicating that f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h participates in the adsorption reaction of phosphorus 28 phosphorus adsorption onto the fm2 can be attributed to the replacement of surface hydroxyl groups via the formation of monodentate and bidentate complexes 3 5 2 ftir fourier transform infrared ftir analysis was carried out in the range of 600 3600 cm 1 to identify different functional groups on the fm2 and tl surface fig 7 represents an infrared spectrum of fm2 and tl in which the bands at wavenumbers 3429 and 1624 c m 1 were attributed to the stretching and bending vibrations of oh in the adsorbed water 28 the bands at 460 and 548 c m 1 were attributed to the fe o bond therefore the transmittance of the ferrite bond of the modified ceramsite was enhanced in figs 7a and b the intermediate frequency region at 1037 c m 1 was attributed to the vibration absorption region of the si o bond moreover the absorption peak of c o 3 2 was observed at 1 427 c m 1 which was uniquely characteristic of unaltered ceramsite the bands at 1110 c m 1 and 1155 c m 1 were attributed to the vibration of the metal oxide hydroxyl groups moh 14 28 finally 43 fig 7c and d show an infrared spectrum of the surface material of the iron manganese modified ceramsites after adsorption in which there was a decrease in the transmittance at 1110 c m 1 and 1155 c m 1 indicating that the metal oxide hydroxyl groups moh were weakened this can be attributed to moh group depletion due to reactions with phosphate to form monodentate and bidentate phosphate complexes 28 which led to an increase in transmittance 3 6 isothermal adsorption the phosphorus adsorption process by ceramsites mainly conforms to the langmuir and freundlich isotherm adsorption models the langmuir model is based on monolayer adsorption and theorizes that the adsorbate is uniformly and specifically adsorbed onto the adsorbent s surface with a maximum saturation adsorption amount qm 44 47 qm is calculated as follows 48 1 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m where ce is the equilibrium adsorption concentration mg l qe is the equilibrium adsorption amount mg g qm is the theoretical maximum saturation adsorption amount mg g and kl is the langmuir adsorption constant which is related to the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate 2 49 kl and qe can be determined using a linear fitting of ce qe and ce fig 8 shows the langmuir isothermal adsorption curves for each of the ceramsite sample types fig 9 is the linearized model of the langmuir isotherm adsorption curves 50 the langmuir adsorption isotherm equations and correlation coefficients for phosphorus adsorption by the untreated and modified ceramsites are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the correlations captured by the fitting equations were good the r2 values of all the equations were greater than 0 99 51 except for m5 and fm1 for the various series of ceramsites the qm of f3 fm2 and m3 achieved maximum values at 2 44 2 751 and 1 567 mg g respectively for the fm series the qm value increased from 2 236 to 2 751 mg l with the corresponding k value increasing from 0 135 to 0 260 analyses revealed a positive correlation between qm and kl 50 52 it can be seen from table 3 that similar patterns existed for both the f and m series it can be concluded that the affinity between the absorbent and absorbate strengthens as the qm value of the adsorbent increases the langmuir equilibrium adsorption constant rl is a dimensionless separation factor and may be calculated by 53 2 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 is the initial phosphate concentration it can be noted from table 4 that the different rl values represent different adsorption types all modified ceramsites had favorable phosphorus adsorption values as their rl values ranged from 0 to 1 table 5 additionally the rl of all the modified ceramsites were smaller than those of the tl sample indicating that the modification facilitated phosphorus adsorption 54 the adsorption isotherm assumes that intermolecular forces decrease rapidly with distance and consequently predicts the existence of a monolayer of adsorbate at the outer surface of the adsorbent it also assumes that adsorption takes place at specific sites within the adsorbent it is believed that once the adsorbate occupies a site no further adsorption takes place at that site 47 the freundlich isothermal adsorption model represented by an empirical equation eq 3 hypothesizes that adsorption by an adsorbent occurs unevenly and simultaneously across multiple layers eliminating the existence of maximum saturation adsorption 2 55 3 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where ce is the equilibrium adsorption concentration mg l qe is the equilibrium adsorption amount mg g kf and 1 n are freundlich constants and n is a dimensionless parameter a linear fitting was performed with a logarithmic equation to determine the freundlich constant of each ceramsite type fig 10 the freundlich adsorption isothermal equations and correlation coefficients for phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites are shown in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the correlations of the freundlich fitting equations were good reaching r2 values of 0 9 or greater however these r2 values were lower than those of the langmuir model therefore phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites conforms better to the langmuir adsorption isothermal model i e monolayer and specific adsorption the kf value indicates the ability or lack thereof of a material to adsorb phosphorus theoretically a larger kf value is indicative of a stronger adsorption capacity 53 the kf value of the tl samples was only 0 01 in comparison the kf values of f3 m3 and fm2 the highest for their respective series were 0 324 0 315 and 0 440 respectively f3 m3 and fm2 had the strongest adsorption capacities among their series these results were similar to the trends observed for the qm values using the langmuir equations the n value is a constant related to adsorption strength and surface heterogeneity 53 usually smaller n values indicate that a material has a better phosphorus adsorption capacity from table 6 it can be seen that the larger the kf value the smaller the corresponding n value this indicates that the easy absorption of phosphorus by the modified ceramsites is caused by their adsorption capacities 2 3 7 isothermal desorption in water excessive phosphorus will cause eutrophication however phosphorus deficiency also affects the growth of aquatic life and destroys the ecological balance when ceramsites are used to treat wastewater their surfaces contain large amounts of phosphorus this phosphorus can later be desorbed in water bodies characterized by phosphorus deficiency however this may cause secondary environmental pollution and facilitate the growth of undesirable organisms 56 plant roots secrete low molecular weight organic acids when exposed to the stresses of phosphorus deficiency this promotes their use of insoluble phosphorus to maintain normal physiological activities 57 in scenarios where ceramsites are used within lakes and ecological wetlands acids and alkalis cannot be directly added to instigate the desorption of phosphorus from the ceramsites doing so would cause secondary pollution of the ecological environment when the low molecular weight organic acids have accumulated to a specific extent they would compete with phosphates for complexation sites on the surface of the ceramsites thereby reducing the phosphorus adsorption potential citric acid is a common plant root exudate which was used in this study as a desorbent at a concentration of 5 mmol l 58 although many adsorbents have large adsorption capacities the corresponding desorption rates are also high for all the modified ceramsites in this study the desorption rates were less than 10 as shown in fig 11 a for comparison the desorption rate of the tl sample was 19 the trend of desorption rates for the series was m f fm f3 m3 and fm2 had the largest desorption rates among their respective series with fm2 having the largest desorption rate overall at 8 2 its adsorption capacity was also the largest among all the materials examined herein at 2 7 mg g these three treated ceramsites were selected for further investigation of desorption rates under different initial phosphorus concentrations 10 50 and 100 mg l it can be seen from fig 11b that the desorption rate increased as the initial phosphorus concentration increased 3 8 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics pseudo second order pso kinetics and the elovich equation were both used to predict adsorption mechanisms of the ceramsites the equation for pso kinetics is 59 61 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt is the adsorption amount at time t min mg g and k2 is a constant for the adsorption rate of the pso model g mg min the values of qe and k2 can be obtained from the slope and intercept of t qt versus t respectively as shown in fig 12 the initial adsorption rate iar h mg g min can be expressed as 2 5 h k 2 q e 2 table 7 and fig 12 demonstrate that the pso kinetics accurately described the kinetics of phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites at different temperatures the correlation r2 of all fitted equations were greater than 0 98 this indicates that the kinetics of ceramsite dephosphorization follows the pso model as the temperature was increased the qm of f3 fm2 m3 and tl also gradually increased fig 13 shows that the iar of phosphorus also increased in proportion with the temperature and that fm2 had the largest iar under all temperature conditions at a reaction temperature of 45 c the iar of fn2 was 0 011 mg g min which corresponds to a fivefold increase over that of tl therefore raising the temperature promoted phosphorus adsorption by the ceramsites doing so not only increased the adsorption capacity but also the values of iars the elovich equation can be used to accurately describe pso kinetics it is semi empirical and does not stipulate any particular adsorption mechanism between the adsorbent and adsorbate however the elovich equation is excellent for fitting irregular data 2 62 the elovich equation is 63 64 6 q t ln a e b e b e 1 b e l n t where ae and be are constants of the elovich equation and are obtained from the slope and intercept of qt versus ln t ae is representative of the iar and be is a constant related to both the surface coverage and the surface activation energy of the adsorbent since the ceramsites have complex surface compositions their surface activation energies can vary greatly the elovich equation is highly suitable to describe processes involving substantial changes in activation energies 31 the applicability of the simple elovich equation to our current kinetics data is consistent with the results of other researchers that is the elovich equation describes the adsorption kinetics of phosphates on soil and soil minerals well 31 65 the kinetic constants of the elovich equation are listed in table 8 and the linear fittings between qt and ln t are shown in fig 14 it can be seen from table 8 that both ae and be vary with temperature when the temperature was increased from 25 to 45 c the ae of f3 m3 fm2 and tl increased from 0 00436 to 0 01189 0 00569 to 0 00878 0 00982 to 0 02129 and 0 00274 to 0 00449 respectively for the same temperature increase the be of f3 m3 fm2 and tl decreased from 4 513 to 2 687 4 219 to 3 221 3 052 to 2 333 and 4 490 to 3 384 respectively raising the temperature increased the iar of the ceramsites for phosphorus which is consistent with conclusions drawn from the pso kinetics model the process and mechanism of phosphorus sorption by the ceramsites was further investigated by calculating the adsorption thermodynamics data based on the following equations 2 47 66 7 δ g δ h t δ s 8 δ g r t ln k z 9 ln k z δ h r t δ s r 10 ln k 2 e a r t c where δg represents the gibbs free energy kj mol δh is the change in enthalpy kj mol δs is the change in entropy j mol k r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the absolute temperature k and ea is the activation energy of adsorption k mol in particular kz is an equilibrium constant associated with the langmuir constant b by kz b 5 55 where 55 5 corresponds to the molar concentration of solvent water plotting ln k2 against 103 t provides the apparent activation energy ea the magnitude of the activation energy is mainly used to determine whether the adsorption is physical or chemical physical adsorption typically requires an activation energy of 5 40 kj mol while chemical adsorption requires a higher activation energy of 40 800 kj mol 67 68 the activation energy values listed in table 9 indicate that the adsorption of phosphorus onto the ceramsites is a physical process the activation energies of phosphorus adsorption for f3 m3 fm2 were all larger than that of tl which can be attributed to an energy barrier that was introduced during modification of the ceramsites 2 it is likely that the fe and mn oxides on the surfaces of the f3 m3 and fm2 ceramsites form complexes with phosphate in water due to hydroxylation δh and δs can be obtained as the slope and intercept of the linear fitted line of ln kz and 1 t respectively the negative values of δg as listed in table 10 suggests that the reaction was spontaneous 69 with an increase in reaction temperature the δg of phosphorus adsorption by fm2 decreased from 0 566 to 1 270 kj mol while that by tl decreased from 0 062 to 0 167 kj mol these data show that the reaction became more spontaneous with an increase in reaction temperature phosphorus adsorption was significantly more spontaneous for fm2 f3 and m2 than for tl the positive values of δh in table 10 indicate that the reaction was endothermic with the reaction heat of the modified ceramsites larger than that of the tl sample this is because the fe mn oxides are hydroxylated in water to form complexes with phosphate which requires the absorption of more heat the positive values of δs in table 10 indicate the good affinity between the absorbate and adsorbent as well as an increase in the randomness of the solid liquid interface during adsorption 47 δs was larger for the modified ceramsites than for the tl sample indicating that there was greater affinity between phosphate and the fe and mn oxides that adhered to the surface of the modified ceramsites in conclusion fm2 is the best of all the ceramsites tested a comparative evaluation of the adsorption capacities of various low cost adsorbents for phosphorus species is provided in table 11 this comparison clearly indicates that the modified ceramsites are effective adsorbents for phosphorus removal 4 conclusions in this study ceramsites with a 3 mm particle size were used as carriers and feso4 and kmno4 were used as modifiers for coprecipitation after combustion at high temperatures 500 900 c 15 types of modified ceramsites were obtained for the dephosphorization of water samples the samples were characterized by bet ssa analysis sem eds xrd ftir and zeta potential analysis and isothermal adsorption and desorption experiments were performed to identify the adsorption characteristics the following conclusions were drawn i the freshly formed fm2 suspension synthesized by an oxidation and coprecipitation method exhibited the highest selective adsorption capability toward phosphate compared to fm2 and their simple oxide i e f3 and m3 the surface of the fm2 particles were rough and nanostructured ii the results show that dense nanoparticles of f e 2 o 3 and f e 0 67 m n 0 33 o o h formed on the fm2 the main phosphorus absorption mechanism was the replacement of hydroxyl groups by phosphate on the fe mn oxide surfaces to form a monodentate and bidentate complex iii phosphorus adsorption by the fm series of ceramsites was consistent with the langmuir isothermal adsorption model fm2 had the highest saturation adsorption capacities at 2 751 mg g in comparison the maximum saturation adsorption capacity of the untreated tl ceramsite was 1 182 mg g fm2 displayed the highest phosphorus removal rate it decreased from 92 to 80 as the ph increased from 3 to 10 such a high phosphorus removal rate over a wide ph range is very favorable for practical applications iv the pso model accurately described the phosphorus adsorption kinetics of the modified ceramsites as the reaction temperature increased from 15 to 45 c the iars of the ceramsites increased under the same temperatures the modified ceramsites displayed larger iars than the tl sample adsorption thermodynamics data showed that phosphorus adsorption by ceramsites was a spontaneous endothermic reaction where increases in the temperature were conducive to phosphorus adsorption v fm2 can be applied to the in situ remediation of eutrophic water our future studies will explore the application of modified ceramsites to eutrophic water treatment at present our research has entered its second stage the adsorption performance of modified

14098,conventional carbon activation requires heating carbon at a temperature greater than 700 c for over 3 h consuming 18 600 kcal kg of activated biochar in contrast the ultrasound treatment method is conducted at ambient condition for a very short duration 30 s which requires about 1135 kcal kg of activated bc produced the advanced low temperature acoustic based surface modification method not only increases the porosity and surface functionality of raw biochar but also is economically feasible and environmentally friendly as a sequel of our previous works this study aims to investigate the interaction between ultrasonic structural modification with four different pre treatments including i control with no pretreatment ii edc hbot iii alkali using koh iv acid using hno3 or h3po4 the process was then followed by amine functionalization with dea diethanolamine for nickel removal the results demonstrated that all acoustic based amine functionalized biochar samples without any exception had more amine and oxygen containing functional groups as well as micro porosity compared to those aminated without acoustic activation particularly in samples pretreated with hno3 and h3po4 despite an increase in porosity by ultrasonication metal leaching from us only samples and those activated with edc hobt was observed during longer adsorption durations however the synergism created by the combined effect of ultrasound and koh and h3po4 not only enhanced the adsorption capacity of biochar but also significantly reduced the adsorption duration from 8 to 3 h the highest nickel adsorptions were observed for ultrasonic amine samples activated with h3po4 hno3 koh which were far higher 60 49 and 46 more adsorption without any leaching than raw or us biochar or biochar aminated with edc hobt or without pretreatment keywords ultrasound amine biochar potassium hydroxide nitric acid phosphoric acid heavy metal 1 introduction biochar is the product of lignocellulosic material which is subjected to thermochemical conversion in an oxygen restricted environment at high temperatures 400 800 c 1 2 with heterogeneous composition complex surface chemistry high porosity surface alkalinity and high ion exchange capacity biochar plays a contributory role in addressing the current demands of adsorbents 3 5 the structure and physicochemical properties of biochar which are closely dependent on the process conditions may affect the way it interacts with organic and inorganic compounds for instance the morphological structure and surface functional groups like hydroxyl oh amino nh 2 aldehyde co h and carboxyl co oh occurring over the surface of biochar may form several domains which act as electron acceptors or electron donators for interacting compounds 5 7 despite these surface functionalities the non homogeneity of biochar s structure and the non uniformity of its surface due to defects and unsaturated sites may limit access to many potential active sites and reduce the adsorption capacity 8 different studies have demonstrated the applications of biochar for removal of heavy metals from soil and water 9 as an example chen et al 10 observed maximum cu 2 and zn 2 adsorption capacities of 12 5 mg g and 11 mg g for cornstover biochar synthesized at 600 c as another example biochar made from dairy manure at 300 c adsorbed 54 4 and 23 6 mg g of pb 2 and cd 2 respectively 11 these reported values are much lower than those of activated carbon which are 255 and 91 4 mg g for pb 2 and cd 2 respectively 12 a similar trend was observed in the adsorption of nickel ii from aqueous solution onto sewage sludge biochar 35 50 mg g 1 13 and activated carbon from coconut coirpitch 64 91 mg g 14 the biochar surface can be modified to enhance desirable physicochemical characteristics by adequate choice of activation procedures effective modifications improve the heavy metal removal ability of biochar and its recyclability as well 15 amine functionalization has also been frequently used for enhanced adsorption of metals by biochar table 1 summarizes some of the previous studies that focused on chemical activation particularly amination of biochar and its utilization for heavy metal adsorption the information detailed in table 1 confirms the potentiality of chemical activation towards increases in adsorptive capacity of graphene oxide for heavy metals in addition to amination chemical approaches that include the treatment of biochar by acid bases or oxidizing agents have also been applied to generate chemical functionalization and specific surface porosity and area for example treatment of activated carbons with hcl or hno3 increases their acidity and appears to form new oc bonds without increasing surface area 16 in contrast to chemical treatments physical modification techniques such as heating microwave and ultrasound mainly change the specific surface area pore volume and pore size of the biochar among these ultrasound irradiation is an effective method for physical activation of biochar and enhancing its adsorption capacity 17 18 generation of micro jets shock waves and highly pressurized over heated regions i e hot spots split larger particles into smaller ones clean the smooth surfaces and increase the porosity of solid surfaces 19 20 the effect of ultrasound irradiation on graphitic structures was first reported by stankovich et al 21 who observed the exfoliation of graphite oxide into 1 nm thin sheets acknowledging these findings and given that biochar has graphitic structure too our research group investigated the interaction of ultrasound and biochar in a mixture of co2 and water in several instances in our pioneer work chen et al 22 investigated the interaction of ultrasound biochar co2 water and identified several ultrasound induced synergetic processes including exfoliation of biochar s graphitic structure mineral leaching hydrogenation and reductive fixation of co2 on biochar all these activities happen simultaneously and lead to an increase in the heating value of biochar as a continuation of this work our team further explored the potentiality of ultrasound energy in physical activation of biochar and its synergetic interaction with chemical functionalization h3po4 urea 23 the authors found that physical activation combined with acid treatment and urea functionalization covalently grafts more nitrogen containing functional groups onto the biochar surface leading to complete adsorption of heavy metal ions on the basis of the infrared spectral data the complexation of metal ions toward urea are formed by co and n h2 groups 24 six different coordination modes of metal ion complexes with urea has been reported by ibrahim 25 although ultrasound urea functionalization has been reported to increase metal removal by biochar significant leakage was observed in long term adsorption for samples functionalized without acidic pretreatment therefore the impact and the level of contribution of h3po4 pretreatment on functionalization and the final adsorption capacity of biochar is the missing link of the process to the best of our knowledge the impact of acidic or basic treatments prior to amination has not been comprehensively investigated as observed in table 1 prior biochar aminations have been conducted without any pre treatment given this background and as a continuation of the previous work this study aims to further investigate the interactive effects of physical activation alkaline acid pretreatment and amine functionalization on the adsorption capacity of biochar accordingly four chemical pretreatments were investigated in this work including i control with no pretreatment ii edc hbot iii alkali using koh iv acid using hno3 or h3po4 each process was then completed by amine functionalization the efficacy of the physical activation process was determined by comparing the heavy metal adsorption performances of all raw and aminated biochars with and without acoustic us activation 2 material and methodology 2 1 materials pine wood based raw biochar acquired from biochar now company berthoud

structure and its distribution are important characteristics in biochar as they influence the van der waals interactions between the biochar surface and heavy metal ions 26 in this regard ultrasonication plays a critical role in developing the porosity of biochar structure ultrasound intensity and duration are parameters which play critical roles in modifying the porosity for instance hamdaoui et al 27 observed reduction in cumulative surface area over prolonged sonication time clearly high energy ultrasound irradiation breaks the basal structure of biochar resulting in fragments of variable size these fragments can block surface pores resulting in the reduction of surface area and cumulative adsorption capacity 28 acknowledging the findings of our recent publication 23 this study investigates the effect of combining a favorable duration of 30 s of ultrasound activation of biochar with chemical activation and amine functionalization as reported in table 2 ultrasound had impacts on the structural characteristics of biochar fig 1 at both micro fig 2 and meso levels fig 3 overall a 40 increase from 110 13 to 154 96 m2 g in the microporous surface area and a 23 decrease from 13 50 to 9 89 m2 g in the mesoporous surface area were obtained after 0 5 min of ultrasonication the microporous increment is attributed to the formation of ultrasound induced micro jets and shockwaves which cause the generation of new pores opening of the blocked pores fig 2 and exfoliation of the graphitic structure of biochar these phenomena facilitate the leaching of mineral matter from the biochar structure and allow water molecules to penetrate into the interlayer space of the graphene oxide like structure 29 the morphological changes observed after the ultrasonication of raw biochar are shown in the micrographs provided as figs 1 and 3a the micro jets cause a punching effect that leaves holes or pits on the surface of biochar therefore the irregular uneven and rough surface of raw biochar in fig 1 was modified to a smooth surface with new circular pores fig 3a after ultrasonication the microporous surface area of raw biochar reduced from 110 13 to 78 25 m2 g upon amination of raw bc without any pre treatment us0 dea a slight reduction was also observed in meso surface area and its corresponding porosity a similar reductive trend of micro surface area was observed for aminated bc us30 dea however in this case meso surface area increased slightly due to the blockage of small micro pores mainly generated under ultrasound irradiation and conversion of micro to meso pores following ultrasonication edc hobt activation combined with amine functionalization resulted in the reduction of microporosity in us30 eh1 1 dea to 42 55 m2 g indicating the formation of a layer over the porous structure of ultrasonicated biochar the meso surface area also reduced significantly from 11 42 to 2 90 m2 g similar reductions were observed for unsonicated bc smaller reductions in micro surface area were observed when koh activation was combined with amination us30 koh0 5 dea us30 koh1 5 dea and us30 koh3 dea greater reductions were observed as the concentration of koh increased this observation can further be confirmed through the micrograph obtained for us30 koh1 5 dea fig 3b similar concentration dependent decreases in microporosity were observed for unsonicated biochar the reduction of microporosity may either be due to the penetration of k ions into the ultrasono induced pores or partial coating of biochar surface with koh and dea as shown in fig 3b given the elemental composition values tabulated in table 3 the correlation of the reduction in microporosity with the concentration of koh is consistent with increased incorporation of more n groups with increasing koh treatment meso surface areas tended to increase slightly with sonicated bc and decrease slightly with unsonicated bc after acoustic activation acidic activation hno3 or h3po4 combined with amine functionalization resulted in an increase of both microporous and mesoporous surface area compared to amine functionalized bc with no pretreatment for example the microporous surface area increased from 96 82 us30 dea to 128 31 m2 g us30 p10 dea using h3po4 treatment while hno3 treated samples observed a slightly greater increase to 130 13 m2 g us30 n10 dea the meso porous surface area also increased with either acid treatment higher acidic concentrations of 20 and 30 somewhat reduced both micro and meso surface areas the micro porous surface areas of all the amine functionalized samples were smaller than sonicated unaminated bc us30 though the mesoporous surface areas were higher similar trends of increases in surface areas were observed on acidic treatment of samples without acoustic activation compared to us0 dea in conclusion three points must be highlighted first values of both micro and meso porous surface area of chemically activated samples are significantly higher for ultrasonically activated samples than for those without ultrasound and this superiority is maintained for all treatment conditions second the values of porosity and its corresponding surface area of aminated biochars pretreated with hno3 or h3po4 are remarkably higher than those aminated with koh pretreatment for both the series of unsonicated and sonicated bcs the lowest porosity values were obtained for samples aminated with edc hobt pretreatment and third the micro porosity and its corresponding surface areas of hno3 treated unsonicated bc are slightly lower compared with those treated with h3po4 acidic treatment corrodes the micropore walls of the biochar reducing their surface area 30 page 192 nitric acid ka 2 4 101 is stronger than phosphoric acid ka 7 1 10 3 and hence its reductive effect is more prominent destruction and widening of the micropores causes an increase in the external surface area and the volume of the meso and macropores 31 which is more prominent for hno3 treated samples a similar trend in meso porosity was observed for acoustic activated samples however it must be noted that both micro and meso surface area and porosity of chemically treated aminated samples were significantly higher with sonication than without 35 49 in hno3 and 23 29 in h3po4 treated samples 3 1 2 elemental composition analysis the effects of chemical activating agents on the amination of raw and ultrasound treated biochar by the amine dea were expounded by the elemental analysis of the organic elements c h n o and s as well as a determination of ash content table 3 since the ash content varied widely the elemental composition of the organic elements was also calculated omitting the contribution of ash the entries listed in the first block of table 3 show the effect of physical activation for the biochar sample ultrasonicated at 100 amplitude for 30 s as observed acoustic activation reduced the ash content of biochar while the percentage of the key elements of c and h increased however organic analysis shows that the increases in c and h are due to the decrease in ash and are within experimental error our previous studies have indicated that sonolysis may cause hydrogenation h fixation from water and reductive fixation of c from dissolved co2 such results will be more prominent by using co2 saturated water which is not the case here consistent with our recent work 32 the use of ultrasound alone showed insignificant changes in n and o content compared to raw biochar in the absence of pre activation amine functionalization caused a n increase of 1 4 us0 dea or 1 6 us30 dea times its initial value in unsonicated us0 and sonicated us30 biochar respectively although these small increases are within experimental error this suggests that microporosity which is increased during sonication may be more favorable for the attachment of dea structure than mesoporosity another important point is that the small increase in c following amination of both raw and sonicated samples is consistent with the relatively high c of dea 20 3 1 2 1 the effect of edc hobt activation our recent work 32 demonstrated that the edc hobt coupling reaction may provide efficient activation of carboxyl groups on the surface of biochar the activation step starts with the conversion of carboxylic acid to form o acylisourea as an intermediate in the following step this active species can react with an amine nucleophile to form an amide bond however there is a chance of a side reaction through rearrangement of the o acylisourea to an n acyl urea thus reducing the yield of the product therefore an additive hobt is used to prevent this side reaction during the activation of carboxylic group the details of the mechanism are available in the previous work of the authors 32 as shown by the composition analyses in table 3 use of edc hobt activation increased the n to 1 3 1 6 times its unactivated values in both raw us0 eh1 1 dea and ultrasonicated us30 eh1 1 dea biochar this suggests the impact of activation on enhancement of dea functionalization on the other hand ultrasonication activation did not provide significantly more active sites for edc and hobt to activate carboxyl groups which could be due to the blockage of the initial micro pores as well as those acoustically generated by chemical treatment using edc hobt table 2 32 3 1 2 2 the effect of koh activation the effects of the alternative activating agent potassium hydroxide are presented in the fourth and fifth blocks of table 3 after koh activation o of both raw and physically activated biochar samples were reinforced increasing from 11 36 to 12 38 us0 koh3 dea and 11 86 to 12 21 us30 koh3 dea respectively as the koh concentration increased the o incorporated increased steadily the increase in o was thought be a contributed from the addition of surface functional groups which could be enhanced considerably by koh activation 33 this observation can further be confirmed by the ft ir and ir analysis of the raw and modified samples exhibited later increases of alcoholic or phenolic groups oh carboxylic groups cooh aromatic groups and alkenes ch have been widely reported due to koh activation 34 36 based on literature there are several mechanisms by which koh pre treatment could promote adsorption of dea onto the biochar surface hydroxide treatment of biochar has been reported to create additional surface oxygen functional groups such as carboxy quinone and phenol in the biochar structure 33 35 for example basic hydrolysis of lignin ester linkages can create phenols and carboxylates 37 and carboxylates can result from koh treatment of hydrochars 38 any saponification of lactones would also create carboxylates at intermediate phs protonated dea ammonium cations can form ionic bonds with deprotonated biochar carboxylate anions promoting attachment regardless of ph the dea nh and oh bonds can form hydrogen bond associations with any new polar surface oxygen groups 33 it is also possible that the nitrogen and oxygen lone pairs of dea can associate with newly formed electron acceptor groups like quinone by an n pi electron donor acceptor interaction 35 36 38 it should also be noted that attached dea has a high o 30 4 as the o increased with koh treatment the h increased slightly and the c decreased slightly the n incorporation increased more significantly with koh loading to 1 4 times its aminated value without physical activation for us0 koh3 dea and 1 5 times its aminated value with ultrasonication for us30 koh3 dea notably the n increased as the concentration of koh in the pretreatment increased this shows that koh as activating agent promoted the grafting of amine onto the biochar surface likely due to the presence of potential surface oxygen functional groups 35 in addition all types of koh treatment resulted in an increase of ash content due to the incorporation of k ions into the biochar structure this increase was higher in the case of ultrasonicated samples table 3 due to their higher porosity resulted in the incorporation of more koh into biochar structure 3 1 2 3 the effect of hno3 activation the effects of nitric acid pretreatment are shown in the sixth and seventh blocks of table 3 the n and o increased steadily with increase in hno3 concentration treatment with 10 hno3 increased the nitrogen content by about 1 5 n in both raw and ultrasonicated biochar samples compared to aminated bc without pretreatment incorporation of nitrates would also increase the o because of the large o in hno3 for example the oxygen content increased by 8 1 o in us0 n30 dea and by 6 9 o in us30 n30 dea activation of biochar with hno3 resulted in much higher incorporation of n and o in comparison with h3po4 treatment in a study performed by vinke et al 39 the nitric acid oxidation of activated carbon was thought to be similar to the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons it is feasible that the oxygen and nitrogen functional groups are incorporated in the carbon basal plane during the activation of biochar with nitric acid as in the oxidation of diphenylmethane with nitric acid and bentonite clay shown in reaction 2 40 and the nitration of aromatic rings with nitric acid shown in reactions 3 5 41 2 the nitration reaction 5 on an aromatic ring is an electrophilic substitution reaction the mechanism involves the formation of the highly active nitronium ion no2 produced by autoprotolysis reaction of nitric acid as follows 3 hn o 3 hn o 3 h 2 n o 3 n o 3 4 h 2 n o 3 n o 2 h 2 o autoprotolysis produces nitronium ion in small quantities its formation is aided by the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid 42 the resulting no2 ion is first added to an aromatic pi bond to form an arenium ion and a nitrated arene is formed by deprotonation of the arenium 5 43 5 reaction 6 shows a series of oxidations of a naphthalene ring to form a phthalic acid 44 as can occur with nitric acid oxidation of nitronaphthalene 44 the oxidized ring decarbonylates to form an ortho dicarboxylic acid there is an overall increase of carboxyl and oxygen and decrease of aromaticity 6 in addition to the attachment of n and o containing functional groups trapping of nitrate ions in the bc may also contribute to the significant increase of n and o this result is consistent with the study performed by chingombe et al 45 who confirmed the presence of nitrate ions trapped in the pores of the oxidized carbons on the other hand the c values listed in table 3 decreased as the n and o rose which could be due to the total balance of organic compounds as well as with loss of surface graphitic and aromatic carbon as shown in the possible oxidations of eq 6 3 1 2 4 the effect of h3po4 activation the last blocks of table 3 shows the effects of phosphoric acid on the chemical composition of unsonicated and ultrasonicated biochar samples the carbon oxygen and nitrogen contents of the unsonicated p treated biochar slightly increased compared to its content before treatment however this change in organic composition is due to the significant reduction of ash in the biochar structure addition of 10 h3po4 solution slightly increased oxygen content from 10 04 to 10 36 due to additional adsorption of dea or the catalytic action of h3po4 in activating the biochars resulting in the fixation of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface 46 further increases in phosphoric acid concentration did not however appear to lead to higher incorporations this observation is consistent with the ft ir and ir analysis of the raw and modified samples explained later a similar trend was observed in the n content of p dea biochars the n increased between 1 6 and 1 9 times the values for aminated samples without h3po4 treatment when the h3po4 concentration changed between 10 and 20 this indicates that h3po4 promoted the grafting of amine on the biochar 35 however further increment of phosphoric acid to 30 did not promote additional amination in contrast in ultrasonicated samples block 4 the n incorporation increased steadily with increasing h3po4 concentration increasing h3po4 treatment lowered c h and o at the expense of large increases in ash the elemental analyses for h3po4 activated samples would be consistent with an acid catalyzed dehydration of around 1 mol or decarboxylation of around 2 mol of the sample coupled with the adsorption of 0 6 mol dea for unsonicated biochar and 0 6 2 3 mol dea for sonicated biochar for sonicated char this analysis suggested that the extent of dea adsorption increased with the concentration of the acid the s content for all the samples was observed to vary between 0 02 and 0 03 ultrasonication resulted in large concentration dependent decreases in ash content when nitric acid was used in contrast sonication when phosphoric acid treatment was used resulted in a significant concentration dependent increases in ash content nevertheless the homogeneity of structure and pore uniformity induced by ultrasonication may result in the effective incorporation of acids and amine onto the biochar and result in an increase of n and o contents 3 1 3 effect of modification on functional groups of biochar 3 1 3 1 effect of ultrasonication the ir spectra of raw biochar us0 us30 us0 dea us30 dea us0 eh1 1 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea are shown in fig 4 upon ultrasonication the intensity of oh stretching vibration band wavelength of 3300 3800 cm 1 dropped significantly and it slightly shifted to the lower frequency region indicating a decrease of hydroxyl groups the peak intensity at 1250 1020 cm 1 attributed in part to the cn vibration of amines increased in all amine functionalized samples us0 dea us30 dea us0 eh1 1 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea compared to us0 and us30 chemical activation combined with amine functionalization us0 eh1 1 dea resulted in the strengthening of the peak in comparison with us0 dea the peak signals are more profound in the samples us30 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea thus signifying the importance of ultrasonication in the attachment of n containing functional groups accordingly the elemental analysis showed the maximum n content of 0 35 and 0 47 in table 3 for the samples us30 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea respectively the oh nh peak intensity around 3300 3600 cm 1 increased in us30 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea compared to us30 which suggests an increase of oh nh based functional groups on the surface of biochar during amine functionalization 3 1 3 2 effect of koh the ftir spectra for koh activated biochar samples without ultrasound and with ultrasound in comparison with us0 dea and us30 dea are provided in fig 5 amine functionalization is supported by the addition of the peak around 1250 1020 cm 1 corresponding to cn which was observed to have increased intensity in the aminated samples compared to raw biochar ultrasonication appeared to increase the cn peak intensity for the lowest concentration of koh us30 koh0 5 dea vs us0 koh0 5 dea but did not seem to make a significant difference with the higher concentrations of koh the reaction with amines may be facilitated in sonicated samples due to the presence of the pores as observed from the elemental composition analysis shown in table 3 the sem image showed the porous structure as well as the surface covered with amine 3 1 3 3 effect of nitric acid the effect of nitric acid concentration is presented in fig 6 higher concentrations of nitric acid increased the relative intensity of the oh related peak located at 3300 3600 cm 1 this observation is consistent with o content of the activated biochars however it must be highlighted that the intensities of these peaks are still much lower than those of raw biochar on the other hand dea functionalization caused a wide peak to appear at around 1250 1020 cm 1 this peak is related to cn bonds aliphatic amines it was similar in all aminated samples whether sonicated or not another small peak around 1250 1335 cm 1 which appeared most clearly for samples treated with 30 nitric acid can be ascribed to the presence of cn stretch of aromatic amines or nitro groups this increase is due to the attachment of n functional groups consistent with this ftir peak the elemental analysis for nitric acid treated dea functionalized biochar showed an increase in n content with increase in nitric acid concentration increase in n content could also be due to the nitrate ions trapped in the pores of the oxidized carbons 45 3 1 3 4 effect of phosphoric acid the effect of phosphoric acid concentration on amine functionalization of raw and ultrasonicated biochar is presented in fig 7 the ftir spectra of phosphoric acid treated samples includes mainly the same peaks as observed for nitric acid treated ones however the small cn stretch peak at 1250 1335 cm 1 aromatic amines nitro was not observed for these samples for nitric acid treated samples the intensity of the cn stretch peak at 1250 1020 cm 1 aliphatic amines was independent of sonication however in phosphoric acid treated samples sonicated samples showed more intensity in the 1250 1020 cm 1 region than unsonicated samples and more than hno3 treated samples this observation suggests the prominent role of acoustic activation prior to phosphoric acid treatment consistent with our recent studies emphasizing the role of ultrasonication in chemical activation of raw biochar 23 despite this elemental analysis showed significantly lower n content in samples treated with h3po4 compared to those with hno3 a possible explanation is that the cn peak may have overlapped with po containing functional group absorptions which usually appear at 9001260 cm 1 it has been reported that treatment of ground olive stones with phosphoric acid before pyrolysis results in a biochar with a higher proportion of micropores and cavities on the external surfaces mainly due to the evaporation of phosphoric acid activating agent and degradation of microstructure during the carbonization step 47 in a similar study performed by bailón garcía et al 48 the xps spectrum for oxygen suggested the presence of oxygen double bonded po groups and oxygen single bonded cop at another instance the xps spectrum of phosphonated go could be interpreted without assuming cp bonds but the xps indicated about 20 atom p in the sample suggesting a covalent attachment of phosphate to either o or c 49 assuming the covalent attachment of heteroatom to biochar frameworks our recently published work suggested the following possible reactions at different reaction sites onto the surface biochar 23 i the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by phosphate to form phosphate ester ii direct esterification of a phenolic hydroxyl group to form phosphate ester and iii direct phosphorylation of an aromatic ring by electrophilic aromatic substitution 23 3 1 4 effect on graphitic structure of biochar raman spectroscopy is a non destructive technique aimed to evaluate the nature of defects and disorders of carbon based materials fig 8 present the structural change of raw biochar us0 during its activation through different treatment methods the raman spectrum of raw biochar exhibits two characteristics peaks the d peak at around 1363 cm 1 and the g peak at 1642 cm 1 these are the characteristic peaks of graphitic sp2 structure and thus confirm the similarity of biochar with graphene oxide 50 the prominent d peak corresponds to the out of plane breathing modes of six atom rings in the presence of the structural imperfections created by the attachment of groups such as hydroxyl or epoxide on the carbon basal plane 51 52 the g peak is associated to the first order scattering of the e2g mode and refers to the in plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms in a 2d hexagonal lattice 53 usually the ratio of d to g band intensities id ig is used to indicate the graphitization degree of carbon materials in that the higher the id ig ratio the lower the graphitization degree this increase may either be attributed to the increase of surface defects in the basal plane or change in the basal plane functional groups 54 in the present work the id ig of raw biochar us0 was 0 83 while modified biochars varied between 0 84 and 0 86 table 4 showing that the graphitization degree is decreased following ultrasono chemical activation steps based on deconvolution of the raman spectra shown in fig 8 the id ig increased to 0 86 on ultrasonication us30 such an increase may be attributed to the increase of defects in the basal plane or exfoliation of biochar s graphitic structure due to ultrasonication it implies that cavitation or shockwaves produced as a result of ultrasound irradiations penetrate through the surface of biochar disorder the layers exfoliate its graphitic structure and result in transitions from sp2 to sp3 material 32 as observed us0 dea and us30 dea exhibited d peak at 1373 cm 1 and 1364 cm 1 and the g peak around 1602 18 cm 1 and 1606 18 cm 1 respectively on amine functionalization the d peak position shifted downward for us0 dea while it remain unchanged for us30 dea concomitantly the integrated id ig ratios changed to 0 86 us0 dea and 0 85 us30 dea respectively this indicates the incorporation of n containing groups in the biochar reducing its graphitization degree however the intensity of aminated biochars is significantly lower than unaminated samples which can be due to the increased absorption coefficient of the material due to amine grafting the intensity of raman scattered light is proportional to the number of scattering molecules irradiated by the incident light and inversely proportional to the absorption coefficient of the material compared with us0 dea us0 eh1 1 dea showed a slight decrease to 0 84 in id ig fig 9 displays the raman spectra patterns of koh activated unsonicated and ultrasonicated biochar samples obtained in the spectral range from 0 to 4000 cm 1 for us0 koh0 5 dea us0 koh1 5 dea and us0 koh3 dea samples the d peak was observed at 1357 cm 1 1377 cm 1 and 1379 cm 1 respectively and the g peak appeared around 1599 cm 1 1599 cm 1 and 1619 cm 1 respectively here it is noted that the intensity of g and d peaks were reduced in comparison with raw biochar which is mainly due to the activation of alcoholic phenolic or carboxylic groups and amine functionalization as is obvious from elemental composition analysis table 3 23 55 consequently the id ig ratios were 0 85 0 86 and 0 85 respectively compared with raw and amine treated samples us0 dea insignificant change in id ig ratio was observed the elemental composition showed slight reduction in carbon and hydrogen content while significant increase in ash content was noted these findings are consistent with those observed with edc hobt the effect of hno3 concentration on the graphitization degree of raw and ultrasonicated biochar is shown as fig 10 and the corresponding id ig ratios are provided in table 4 as observed hno3 did not have a significant effect on biochar surface defects as the id ig ratio remained within 0 01 of the ratio for aminated raw and ultrasonicated samples overall the intensity of g and d peaks were reduced in comparison with raw biochar 56 this is consistent with nitric acid treatment resulting in the oxidation of aromatic rings as per the reaction mechanism this activation step subsequently increases the carboxyl and oxygen content and these groups decrease the aromaticity of biochar structure on the other hand the corrosive nature of nitric acid removes a portion of defective carbons which may increase the aromaticity as a resultant of these two effects the id ig stayed roughly constant when nitric acid was used for biochar treatment the coupling effect of phosphoric acid treatment and amine functionalization on the graphitization degree of raw and ultrasonicated biochar is shown in fig 11 for us0 p10 dea us0 p20 dea and us0 p30 dea the d peak was observed around 1338 1363 56 and 1360 31 cm 1 while the g peak appeared around 1596 1598 and 1598 36 cm 1 respectively according to the results table 4 the id ig ratio changed slightly from 0 83 us0 to 0 84 p10 to 0 85 p20 with h3po4 loading for unsonicated biochar these changes showed the presence of more sp3 bonds and transition from sp2 to sp3 materials as a result of h3po4 activation increase of the h3po4 concentration to 30 didn t reduce the intensity of d and g peaks phosphoric acid treatment had no effect on the id ig ratio for sonicated aminated samples 3 2 adsorption 3 2 1 effect of ultrasonication the effect of ultrasonication on the adsorption characteristics of raw biochar is shown in fig 12 the adsorption curve for raw biochar us0 showed the maximum ni 2 uptake of 14 while 42 ni 2 removal was observed with the ultrasonicated sample us30 in both cases the maximum ni 2 removal was obtained within 1 h over longer durations leaching of ni 2 from the biochar back into solution was observed which reduced eventual ni 2 adsorption to 11 and 29 respectively for us0 and us30 samples after 8 h this implies that ultrasonication has a key role in developing the porous structure for maximum adsorption but it cannot prevent the leaching of adsorbed ni 2 over longer experimentation times however the situation is different following amine dea functionalization the adsorption curves for us0 dea and us30 dea in fig 12 showed final adsorption uptake of 29 and 26 respectively the adsorption mechanism of a heavy metal by amine groups is as follows 57 7 r n h 2 m 2 m r n h 2 2 though amination increased the adsorption uptake compared to raw biochar the value was lower than that of the us30 sample indicating that the functionalization blocked some of the pores generated by acoustic activation however leaching was not observed in the samples functionalized with dea which reached maximum absorption in 3 5 h these findings are consistent with those obtained in one of our recent works 23 3 2 2 effect of edc hobt activation biochars chemically activated with edc hobt before amination namely us0 eh1 1 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea had maximum metal uptake of 22 and 14 respectively fig 12 a rise in ni 2 over time indicated the leaching of ni 2 metal for the edc hobt activated samples the results showed that there was no advantage of using edc hobt as chemical activator prior to the amination step this is despite the elemental composition results that suggested that hobt edc contributed to attaching more amino groups to the biochar as the percent nitrogen content increased to 0 38 however the accompanying decrease in o content suggests the loss of other surface functional groups that can play a role in the adsorption of ni 2 this is also in agreement with previous researchers findings 58 the combination of edc hobt chemical activation followed by amine functionalization with ultrasound treatment resulted in a decrease of ni 2 adsorption from 42 for ultrasound alone to 23 furthermore for the samples us30 and us30 eh1 1 dea leaching of ni 2 was observed over longer durations in comparison with unsonicated samples the leaching effect was more pronounced and again showed the ineffectiveness of using ecd hobt as chemical activator for this application 3 2 3 effect of koh fig 13 describes the effect of koh pretreatment on the ni 2 adsorption capacity of aminated biochar samples the adsorption for the first hour was similar to that for us30 for all of the koh treated samples as observed there was a slight dependence on koh loading consistent with the role of both amino as well as carboxyl functional groups in enhancing the adsorption capacity 58 the modified samples removed 53 57 of ni 2 after 8 h while raw biochar removed only 10 over the same experimental duration as seen in fig 13 for each case the adsorption capacity for ni 2 increased rapidly in the first half hour thereafter increasing at a slower rate with no leaching of adsorbed ni 2 this may be due to the decrease in the number of active sites remaining in longer durations this finding is consistent with the results obtained in recently published works 59 60 concerning the attainments of equilibrium within 1 3 h in comparison with the results obtained by koh treated unsonicated biochar open symbols in fig 13 ultrasonication in combination with koh activation blue symbols witnessed an decrease in the maximum adsorption time from 8 h to 3 h with maximum ni 2 removal of 55 us30 koh0 5 dea furthermore leaching was not observed in koh treated samples with the ni 2 continuing to decrease or staying constant after 3 h as observed from the adsorption curves fig 13 for most koh concentrations and adsorption times the unsonicated and ultrasonicated samples had similar adsorption values although some improvement with sonication was seen at 3 and 5 h with the high and low loadings of koh this limited effect of ultrasound implies that koh treatment may tend to suppress the effect of ultrasound on the properties of biochar despite this observation the us30 sample treated with the lowest concentration of 0 5 koh showed the greatest positive effect 55 on the adsorption removal efficiency of biochar 3 2 4 effect of nitric acid treatment fig 14 shows the effect of nitric acid on the adsorption capacity of aminated biochar in comparison with us0 11 and us0 dea 26 a significant increase in ni 2 uptake to 57 was observed after 8 h using us0 n30 dea as adsorbent a negligible difference in ni 2 final adsorptions 55 57 was observed with hno3 loading these findings indicate that although acidic pretreatment of biochar with hno3 prior to amine functionalization significantly increases the adsorption capacity of biochar acid concentrations higher than 10 do not necessarily contribute to further improvement of the process in contrast the elemental composition analysis showed significant increases in both n 1 61 2 13 n and o 13 85 16 51 o content table 3 with increasing nitric acid concentration these increases may indicate nitrate ions trapped inside the pores of the biochar structure 45 in terms of adsorption rate the adsorption capacity increased rapidly in the first half hour and thereafter attained more gradual increments with no leaching of adsorbed ni 2 this suggests a decrease in the number of available active sites over longer durations and indicates the potential value of using shorter adsorption times following acid treatment treatment of biochar with ultrasound followed by different concentrations of nitric acid and amination us30 n30 dea resulted in up to 8 more adsorption in the early stages 1 5 h compared to unsonicated adsorbent in addition increase of hno3 concentration from 10 to 20 in ultrasound activated biochars resulted in a slight improvement in heavy metal uptake up to 4 in these early stages however further pretreating the biochar with 30 hno3 did not significantly contribute to further improving the ni 2 uptake though ultrasonication helped to exfoliate the biochar structure leaching out mineral content and increasing the microporous surface area the subsequent treatment of us30 with nitric acid may result in more nitrate ions trapped inside the porous structure 21 45 consistent with the findings of micropore analysis in table 2 the micropores which were expected to be increased through coupling the effects of ultrasonication and hno3 were instead decreased resulting in a limited improvement in ni 2 metal uptake 3 2 5 effect of phosphoric acid fig 15 shows the effects of phosphoric acid concentration on adsorption capacity of biochar increases in h3po4 concentration resulted in increases in the adsorption capacity of raw aminated biochar especially at middle stages of adsorption 3 5 h a maximum of 68 ni 2 metal removal 150 mg nicl2 l was obtained by us0 p30 dea after 8 h which was 6 times higher than that obtained for raw biochar 11 in one of our recent published works biochar that was activated under ultrasound irradiation pretreated with phosphoric acid and functionalized with urea rather than dea could completely remove ni 2 from a solution containing 100 mg nicl2 l of water 23 the higher ni 2 used in the current study was not tested but the use of dea rather than urea may enhance the biochar adsorption capacity compared with hno3 biochars treated with h3po4 demonstrated a better performance in adsorption of ni 2 ions a maximum metal uptake of 55 was observed for us0 n20 dea while us0 p20 dea demonstrated a maximum uptake of 67 ultrasonication allowed a maximum of 71 ni 2 removal using us30 p30 dea after 8 h somewhat higher than that obtained with us0 p30 dea ultrasonication coupled with h3po4 functionalization us30 p30 dea also allowed a reduction in the time required for substantial 68 removal of ni 2 to 3 h compared to 5 h for 66 removal with unsonicated us0 p30 dea as observed from the adsorption data fig 15 increases in h3po4 concentration from 10 to 20 to 30 significantly increased the metal uptake in both ultrasonicated and non sonicated samples with the biggest differences occurring over medium adsorption durations 3 5 h in case of nitric acid the trapping of nitrate ions inside the porous structure may result in the reduction of active sites for amine functionalization however h3po4 treatment coupled with ultrasonication may increase the availability of more active sites additionally p containing functional groups may also contribute to metal uptake these observations are consistent with both elemental composition analysis and ftir thus emphasizing the role of ultrasound in reducing the duration required for ni 2 metal uptake as with nitric acid and koh treatments leaching was not observed in longer adsorption durations clarifying the utility of h3po4 treatment in this process 4 conclusion biochar a carbon rich and porous material is derived from pyrolyzing lignocellulosic material in an oxygen limited environment specific surface area pore distribution surface functional groups and inorganic content are factors which play important roles in defining the metal adsorption behavior of biochar in order to exploit these factors a biochar treatment was performed in three stages i physical activation with ultrasound ii chemical activation with edc hobt base koh or one of two acids hno3 or h3po4 and iii functionalization with dea in the first stage ultrasound assisted physical activation induces microjets which penetrate through the biochar surface exfoliating and breaking the irregular shaped biochar to alter the surface area and pore distribution and also reducing the mineral content in the second stage chemical activation with varying concentrations was performed followed by amine functionalization with dea in the last stage as a result amine and oxygen containing functional groups increased on the biochar surface in this study maximum ni 2 removals of 57 60 71 were observed for sonicated koh hno3 and h3po4 treated amine functionalized biochars within 3 8 and 3 h of adsorption respectively in all cases sonication resulted in modest but consistent increases in absorption capacity this increase in adsorption capacity is consistent with the formation of ultrasound induced porosity which could provide new active sites for the grafting of amine and oxygen containing functional groups considering the prospects of using biochar as a sustainable and environment friendly adsorbent ultrasonic treatment for a short 30 s duration followed by chemical activation with h3po4 and functionalization with dea provides an efficient treatment

14098,conventional carbon activation requires heating carbon at a temperature greater than 700 c for over 3 h consuming 18 600 kcal kg of activated biochar in contrast the ultrasound treatment method is conducted at ambient condition for a very short duration 30 s which requires about 1135 kcal kg of activated bc produced the advanced low temperature acoustic based surface modification method not only increases the porosity and surface functionality of raw biochar but also is economically feasible and environmentally friendly as a sequel of our previous works this study aims to investigate the interaction between ultrasonic structural modification with four different pre treatments including i control with no pretreatment ii edc hbot iii alkali using koh iv acid using hno3 or h3po4 the process was then followed by amine functionalization with dea diethanolamine for nickel removal the results demonstrated that all acoustic based amine functionalized biochar samples without any exception had more amine and oxygen containing functional groups as well as micro porosity compared to those aminated without acoustic activation particularly in samples pretreated with hno3 and h3po4 despite an increase in porosity by ultrasonication metal leaching from us only samples and those activated with edc hobt was observed during longer adsorption durations however the synergism created by the combined effect of ultrasound and koh and h3po4 not only enhanced the adsorption capacity of biochar but also significantly reduced the adsorption duration from 8 to 3 h the highest nickel adsorptions were observed for ultrasonic amine samples activated with h3po4 hno3 koh which were far higher 60 49 and 46 more adsorption without any leaching than raw or us biochar or biochar aminated with edc hobt or without pretreatment keywords ultrasound amine biochar potassium hydroxide nitric acid phosphoric acid heavy metal 1 introduction biochar is the product of lignocellulosic material which is subjected to thermochemical conversion in an oxygen restricted environment at high temperatures 400 800 c 1 2 with heterogeneous composition complex surface chemistry high porosity surface alkalinity and high ion exchange capacity biochar plays a contributory role in addressing the current demands of adsorbents 3 5 the structure and physicochemical properties of biochar which are closely dependent on the process conditions may affect the way it interacts with organic and inorganic compounds for instance the morphological structure and surface functional groups like hydroxyl oh amino nh 2 aldehyde co h and carboxyl co oh occurring over the surface of biochar may form several domains which act as electron acceptors or electron donators for interacting compounds 5 7 despite these surface functionalities the non homogeneity of biochar s structure and the non uniformity of its surface due to defects and unsaturated sites may limit access to many potential active sites and reduce the adsorption capacity 8 different studies have demonstrated the applications of biochar for removal of heavy metals from soil and water 9 as an example chen et al 10 observed maximum cu 2 and zn 2 adsorption capacities of 12 5 mg g and 11 mg g for cornstover biochar synthesized at 600 c as another example biochar made from dairy manure at 300 c adsorbed 54 4 and 23 6 mg g of pb 2 and cd 2 respectively 11 these reported values are much lower than those of activated carbon which are 255 and 91 4 mg g for pb 2 and cd 2 respectively 12 a similar trend was observed in the adsorption of nickel ii from aqueous solution onto sewage sludge biochar 35 50 mg g 1 13 and activated carbon from coconut coirpitch 64 91 mg g 14 the biochar surface can be modified to enhance desirable physicochemical characteristics by adequate choice of activation procedures effective modifications improve the heavy metal removal ability of biochar and its recyclability as well 15 amine functionalization has also been frequently used for enhanced adsorption of metals by biochar table 1 summarizes some of the previous studies that focused on chemical activation particularly amination of biochar and its utilization for heavy metal adsorption the information detailed in table 1 confirms the potentiality of chemical activation towards increases in adsorptive capacity of graphene oxide for heavy metals in addition to amination chemical approaches that include the treatment of biochar by acid bases or oxidizing agents have also been applied to generate chemical functionalization and specific surface porosity and area for example treatment of activated carbons with hcl or hno3 increases their acidity and appears to form new oc bonds without increasing surface area 16 in contrast to chemical treatments physical modification techniques such as heating microwave and ultrasound mainly change the specific surface area pore volume and pore size of the biochar among these ultrasound irradiation is an effective method for physical activation of biochar and enhancing its adsorption capacity 17 18 generation of micro jets shock waves and highly pressurized over heated regions i e hot spots split larger particles into smaller ones clean the smooth surfaces and increase the porosity of solid surfaces 19 20 the effect of ultrasound irradiation on graphitic structures was first reported by stankovich et al 21 who observed the exfoliation of graphite oxide into 1 nm thin sheets acknowledging these findings and given that biochar has graphitic structure too our research group investigated the interaction of ultrasound and biochar in a mixture of co2 and water in several instances in our pioneer work chen et al 22 investigated the interaction of ultrasound biochar co2 water and identified several ultrasound induced synergetic processes including exfoliation of biochar s graphitic structure mineral leaching hydrogenation and reductive fixation of co2 on biochar all these activities happen simultaneously and lead to an increase in the heating value of biochar as a continuation of this work our team further explored the potentiality of ultrasound energy in physical activation of biochar and its synergetic interaction with chemical functionalization h3po4 urea 23 the authors found that physical activation combined with acid treatment and urea functionalization covalently grafts more nitrogen containing functional groups onto the biochar surface leading to complete adsorption of heavy metal ions on the basis of the infrared spectral data the complexation of metal ions toward urea are formed by co and n h2 groups 24 six different coordination modes of metal ion complexes with urea has been reported by ibrahim 25 although ultrasound urea functionalization has been reported to increase metal removal by biochar significant leakage was observed in long term adsorption for samples functionalized without acidic pretreatment therefore the impact and the level of contribution of h3po4 pretreatment on functionalization and the final adsorption capacity of biochar is the missing link of the process to the best of our knowledge the impact of acidic or basic treatments prior to amination has not been comprehensively investigated as observed in table 1 prior biochar aminations have been conducted without any pre treatment given this background and as a continuation of the previous work this study aims to further investigate the interactive effects of physical activation alkaline acid pretreatment and amine functionalization on the adsorption capacity of biochar accordingly four chemical pretreatments were investigated in this work including i control with no pretreatment ii edc hbot iii alkali using koh iv acid using hno3 or h3po4 each process was then completed by amine functionalization the efficacy of the physical activation process was determined by comparing the heavy metal adsorption performances of all raw and aminated biochars with and without acoustic us activation 2 material and methodology 2 1 materials pine wood based raw biochar acquired from biochar now company berthoud

1 biochar activation and synthesis before activation the raw biochar acquired from biochar now was sieved using taylor sieves to a particle size range of 125 250 μm for physical activation 3 g of raw biochar slightly mixed with 250 ml of deionized water was subjected to ultrasound by a 20 khz ultrasonic processor qsonica sonicator model no q700 with maximum power of 700 w at 100 amplitude for 30 s the ultrasono modified biochar us30 was filtered and vacuum dried overnight at 60 c us30 was then chemically treated in two steps in the first step of the pre treatment process the potential surface functional groups of biochar were chemically activated with different activating agents i edc and hobt at fixed weight ratio of 1 1 ii koh in an amount ranging from 0 5 to 3 times the weight of raw biochar iii 10 20 or 30 nitric acid solutions 250 ml or iv 10 20 or 30 phosphoric acid solutions for agents i and ii the mixtures were stirred at 35 c for 24 h washed with deionized water filtered and

chemically activated dried samples were suspended in methanol and amine dea was added at 2 5 times the weight of the activated biochar the samples were stirred at 35 c for 24 h after completion of the reaction the mixtures were filtered with repeated washing with deionized water dried as before and stored in air tight glass vials as controls the two step chemical treatments were also performed with raw unsonicated biochar us0 to study the effectiveness of ultrasonic treatment on the chemical activation process in addition a single step chemical treatment dea functionalization without any pretreatment process was performed on both us0 and us30 biochar to investigate the effects of the chemical activating agents edc hobt koh hno3 or h3po4 on surface functional group changes 2 2 2

using a pre loaded program 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of physiochemically modified biochar 3 1 1 porosity and surface area analysis surface properties including surface area pore structure and its distribution are important characteristics in biochar as they influence the van der waals interactions between the biochar surface and heavy metal ions 26 in this regard ultrasonication plays a critical role in developing the porosity of biochar structure ultrasound intensity and duration are parameters which play critical roles in modifying the porosity for instance hamdaoui et al 27 observed reduction in cumulative surface area over prolonged sonication time clearly high energy ultrasound irradiation breaks the basal structure of biochar resulting in fragments of variable size these fragments can block surface pores resulting in the reduction of surface area and cumulative adsorption capacity 28 acknowledging the findings of our recent publication 23 this study investigates the effect of combining a favorable duration of 30 s of ultrasound activation of biochar with chemical activation and amine functionalization as reported in table 2 ultrasound had impacts on the structural characteristics of biochar fig 1 at both micro fig 2 and meso levels fig 3 overall a 40 increase from 110 13 to 154 96 m2 g in the microporous surface area and a 23 decrease from 13 50 to 9 89 m2 g in the mesoporous surface area were obtained after 0 5 min of ultrasonication the microporous increment is attributed to the formation of ultrasound induced micro jets and shockwaves which cause the generation of new pores opening of the blocked pores fig 2 and exfoliation of the graphitic structure of biochar these phenomena facilitate the leaching of mineral matter from the biochar structure and allow water molecules to penetrate into the interlayer space of the graphene oxide like structure 29 the morphological changes observed after the ultrasonication of raw biochar are shown in the micrographs provided as figs 1 and 3a the micro jets cause a punching effect that leaves holes or pits on the surface of biochar therefore the irregular uneven and rough surface of raw biochar in fig 1 was modified to a smooth surface with new circular pores fig 3a after ultrasonication the microporous surface area of raw biochar reduced from 110 13 to 78 25 m2 g upon amination of raw bc without any pre treatment us0 dea a slight reduction was also observed in meso surface area and its corresponding porosity a similar reductive trend of micro surface area was observed for aminated bc us30 dea however in this case meso surface area increased slightly due to the blockage of small micro pores mainly generated under ultrasound irradiation and conversion of micro to meso pores following ultrasonication edc hobt activation combined with amine functionalization resulted in the reduction of microporosity in us30 eh1 1 dea to 42 55 m2 g indicating the formation of a layer over the porous structure of ultrasonicated biochar the meso surface area also reduced significantly from 11 42 to 2 90 m2 g similar reductions were observed for unsonicated bc smaller reductions in micro surface area were observed when koh activation was combined with amination us30 koh0 5 dea us30 koh1 5 dea and us30 koh3 dea greater reductions were observed as the concentration of koh increased this observation can further be confirmed through the micrograph obtained for us30 koh1 5 dea fig 3b similar concentration dependent decreases in microporosity were observed for unsonicated biochar the reduction of microporosity may either be due to the penetration of k ions into the ultrasono induced pores or partial coating of biochar surface with koh and dea as shown in fig 3b given the elemental composition values tabulated in table 3 the correlation of the reduction in microporosity with the concentration of koh is consistent with increased incorporation of more n groups with increasing koh treatment meso surface areas tended to increase slightly with sonicated bc and decrease slightly with unsonicated bc after acoustic activation acidic activation hno3 or h3po4 combined with amine functionalization resulted in an increase of both microporous and mesoporous surface area compared to amine functionalized bc with no pretreatment for example the microporous surface area increased from 96 82 us30 dea to 128 31 m2 g us30 p10 dea using h3po4 treatment while hno3 treated samples observed a slightly greater increase to 130 13 m2 g us30 n10 dea the meso porous surface area also increased with either acid treatment higher acidic concentrations of 20 and 30 somewhat reduced both micro and meso surface areas the micro porous surface areas of all the amine functionalized samples were smaller than sonicated unaminated bc us30 though the mesoporous surface areas were higher similar trends of increases in surface areas were observed on acidic treatment of samples without acoustic activation compared to us0 dea in conclusion three points must be highlighted first values of both micro and meso porous surface area of chemically activated samples are significantly higher for ultrasonically activated samples than for those without ultrasound and this superiority is maintained for all treatment conditions second the values of porosity and its corresponding surface area of aminated biochars pretreated with hno3 or h3po4 are remarkably higher than those aminated with koh pretreatment for both the series of unsonicated and sonicated bcs the lowest porosity values were obtained for samples aminated with edc hobt pretreatment and third the micro porosity and its corresponding surface areas of hno3 treated unsonicated bc are slightly lower compared with those treated with h3po4 acidic treatment corrodes the micropore walls of the biochar reducing their surface area 30 page 192 nitric acid ka 2 4 101 is stronger than phosphoric acid ka 7 1 10 3 and hence its reductive effect is more prominent destruction and widening of the micropores causes an increase in the external surface area and the volume of the meso and macropores 31 which is more prominent for hno3 treated samples a similar trend in meso porosity was observed for acoustic activated samples however it must be noted that both micro and meso surface area and porosity of chemically treated aminated samples were significantly higher with sonication than without 35 49 in hno3 and 23 29 in h3po4 treated samples 3 1 2 elemental composition analysis the effects of chemical activating agents on the amination of raw and ultrasound treated biochar by the amine dea were expounded by the elemental analysis of the organic elements c h n o and s as well as a determination of ash content table 3 since the ash content varied widely the elemental composition of the organic elements was also calculated omitting the contribution of ash the entries listed in the first block of table 3 show the effect of physical activation for the biochar sample ultrasonicated at 100 amplitude for 30 s as observed acoustic activation reduced the ash content of biochar while the percentage of the key elements of c and h increased however organic analysis shows that the increases in c and h are due to the decrease in ash and are within experimental error our previous studies have indicated that sonolysis may cause hydrogenation h fixation from water and reductive fixation of c from dissolved co2 such results will be more prominent by using co2 saturated water which is not the case here consistent with our recent work 32 the use of ultrasound alone showed insignificant changes in n and o content compared to raw biochar in the absence of pre activation amine functionalization caused a n increase of 1 4 us0 dea or 1 6 us30 dea times its initial value in unsonicated us0 and sonicated us30 biochar respectively although these small increases are within experimental error this suggests that microporosity which is increased during sonication may be more favorable for the attachment of dea structure than mesoporosity another important point is that the small increase in c following amination of both raw and sonicated samples is consistent with the relatively high c of dea 20 3 1 2 1 the effect of edc hobt activation our recent work 32 demonstrated that the edc hobt coupling reaction may provide efficient activation of carboxyl groups on the surface of biochar the activation step starts with the conversion of carboxylic acid to form o acylisourea as an intermediate in the following step this active species can react with an amine nucleophile to form an amide bond however there is a chance of a side reaction through rearrangement of the o acylisourea to an n acyl urea thus reducing the yield of the product therefore an additive hobt is used to prevent this side reaction during the activation of carboxylic group the details of the mechanism are available in the previous work of the authors 32 as shown by the composition analyses in table 3 use of edc hobt activation increased the n to 1 3 1 6 times its unactivated values in both raw us0 eh1 1 dea and ultrasonicated us30 eh1 1 dea biochar this suggests the impact of activation on enhancement of dea functionalization on the other hand ultrasonication activation did not provide significantly more active sites for edc and hobt to activate carboxyl groups which could be due to the blockage of the initial micro pores as well as those acoustically generated by chemical treatment using edc hobt table 2 32 3 1 2 2 the effect of koh activation the effects of the alternative activating agent potassium hydroxide are presented in the fourth and fifth blocks of table 3 after koh activation o of both raw and physically activated biochar samples were reinforced increasing from 11 36 to 12 38 us0 koh3 dea and 11 86 to 12 21 us30 koh3 dea respectively as the koh concentration increased the o incorporated increased steadily the increase in o was thought be a contributed from the addition of surface functional groups which could be enhanced considerably by koh activation 33 this observation can further be confirmed by the ft ir and ir analysis of the raw and modified samples exhibited later increases of alcoholic or phenolic groups oh carboxylic groups cooh aromatic groups and alkenes ch have been widely reported due to koh activation 34 36 based on literature there are several mechanisms by which koh pre treatment could promote adsorption of dea onto the biochar surface hydroxide treatment of biochar has been reported to create additional surface oxygen functional groups such as carboxy quinone and phenol in the biochar structure 33 35 for example basic hydrolysis of lignin ester linkages can create phenols and carboxylates 37 and carboxylates can result from koh treatment of hydrochars 38 any saponification of lactones would also create carboxylates at intermediate phs protonated dea ammonium cations can form ionic bonds with deprotonated biochar carboxylate anions promoting attachment regardless of ph the dea nh and oh bonds can form hydrogen bond associations with any new polar surface oxygen groups 33 it is also possible that the nitrogen and oxygen lone pairs of dea can associate with newly formed electron acceptor groups like quinone by an n pi electron donor acceptor interaction 35 36 38 it should also be noted that attached dea has a high o 30 4 as the o increased with koh treatment the h increased slightly and the c decreased slightly the n incorporation increased more significantly with koh loading to 1 4 times its aminated value without physical activation for us0 koh3 dea and 1 5 times its aminated value with ultrasonication for us30 koh3 dea notably the n increased as the concentration of koh in the pretreatment increased this shows that koh as activating agent promoted the grafting of amine onto the biochar surface likely due to the presence of potential surface oxygen functional groups 35 in addition all types of koh treatment resulted in an increase of ash content due to the incorporation of k ions into the biochar structure this increase was higher in the case of ultrasonicated samples table 3 due to their higher porosity resulted in the incorporation of more koh into biochar structure 3 1 2 3 the effect of hno3 activation the effects of nitric acid pretreatment are shown in the sixth and seventh blocks of table 3 the n and o increased steadily with increase in hno3 concentration treatment with 10 hno3 increased the nitrogen content by about 1 5 n in both raw and ultrasonicated biochar samples compared to aminated bc without pretreatment incorporation of nitrates would also increase the o because of the large o in hno3 for example the oxygen content increased by 8 1 o in us0 n30 dea and by 6 9 o in us30 n30 dea activation of biochar with hno3 resulted in much higher incorporation of n and o in comparison with h3po4 treatment in a study performed by vinke et al 39 the nitric acid oxidation of activated carbon was thought to be similar to the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons it is feasible that the oxygen and nitrogen functional groups are incorporated in the carbon basal plane during the activation of biochar with nitric acid as in the oxidation of diphenylmethane with nitric acid and bentonite clay shown in reaction 2 40 and the nitration of aromatic rings with nitric acid shown in reactions 3 5 41 2 the nitration reaction 5 on an aromatic ring is an electrophilic substitution reaction the mechanism involves the formation of the highly active nitronium ion no2 produced by autoprotolysis reaction of nitric acid as follows 3 hn o 3 hn o 3 h 2 n o 3 n o 3 4 h 2 n o 3 n o 2 h 2 o autoprotolysis produces nitronium ion in small quantities its formation is aided by the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid 42 the resulting no2 ion is first added to an aromatic pi bond to form an arenium ion and a nitrated arene is formed by deprotonation of the arenium 5 43 5 reaction 6 shows a series of oxidations of a naphthalene ring to form a phthalic acid 44 as can occur with nitric acid oxidation of nitronaphthalene 44 the oxidized ring decarbonylates to form an ortho dicarboxylic acid there is an overall increase of carboxyl and oxygen and decrease of aromaticity 6 in addition to the attachment of n and o containing functional groups trapping of nitrate ions in the bc may also contribute to the significant increase of n and o this result is consistent with the study performed by chingombe et al 45 who confirmed the presence of nitrate ions trapped in the pores of the oxidized carbons on the other hand the c values listed in table 3 decreased as the n and o rose which could be due to the total balance of organic compounds as well as with loss of surface graphitic and aromatic carbon as shown in the possible oxidations of eq 6 3 1 2 4 the effect of h3po4 activation the last blocks of table 3 shows the effects of phosphoric acid on the chemical composition of unsonicated and ultrasonicated biochar samples the carbon oxygen and nitrogen contents of the unsonicated p treated biochar slightly increased compared to its content before treatment however this change in organic composition is due to the significant reduction of ash in the biochar structure addition of 10 h3po4 solution slightly increased oxygen content from 10 04 to 10 36 due to additional adsorption of dea or the catalytic action of h3po4 in activating the biochars resulting in the fixation of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface 46 further increases in phosphoric acid concentration did not however appear to lead to higher incorporations this observation is consistent with the ft ir and ir analysis of the raw and modified samples explained later a similar trend was observed in the n content of p dea biochars the n increased between 1 6 and 1 9 times the values for aminated samples without h3po4 treatment when the h3po4 concentration changed between 10 and 20 this indicates that h3po4 promoted the grafting of amine on the biochar 35 however further increment of phosphoric acid to 30 did not promote additional amination in contrast in ultrasonicated samples block 4 the n incorporation increased steadily with increasing h3po4 concentration increasing h3po4 treatment lowered c h and o at the expense of large increases in ash the elemental analyses for h3po4 activated samples would be consistent with an acid catalyzed dehydration of around 1 mol or decarboxylation of around 2 mol of the sample coupled with the adsorption of 0 6 mol dea for unsonicated biochar and 0 6 2 3 mol dea for sonicated biochar for sonicated char this analysis suggested that the extent of dea adsorption increased with the concentration of the acid the s content for all the samples was observed to vary between 0 02 and 0 03 ultrasonication resulted in large concentration dependent decreases in ash content when nitric acid was used in contrast sonication when phosphoric acid treatment was used resulted in a significant concentration dependent increases in ash content nevertheless the homogeneity of structure and pore uniformity induced by ultrasonication may result in the effective incorporation of acids and amine onto the biochar and result in an increase of n and o contents 3 1 3 effect of modification on functional groups of biochar 3 1 3 1 effect of ultrasonication the ir spectra of raw biochar us0 us30 us0 dea us30 dea us0 eh1 1 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea are shown in fig 4 upon ultrasonication the intensity of oh stretching vibration band wavelength of 3300 3800 cm 1 dropped significantly and it slightly shifted to the lower frequency region indicating a decrease of hydroxyl groups the peak intensity at 1250 1020 cm 1 attributed in part to the cn vibration of amines increased in all amine functionalized samples us0 dea us30 dea us0 eh1 1 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea compared to us0 and us30 chemical activation combined with amine functionalization us0 eh1 1 dea resulted in the strengthening of the peak in comparison with us0 dea the peak signals are more profound in the samples us30 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea thus signifying the importance of ultrasonication in the attachment of n containing functional groups accordingly the elemental analysis showed the maximum n content of 0 35 and 0 47 in table 3 for the samples us30 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea respectively the oh nh peak intensity around 3300 3600 cm 1 increased in us30 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea compared to us30 which suggests an increase of oh nh based functional groups on the surface of biochar during amine functionalization 3 1 3 2 effect of koh the ftir spectra for koh activated biochar samples without ultrasound and with ultrasound in comparison with us0 dea and us30 dea are provided in fig 5 amine functionalization is supported by the addition of the peak around 1250 1020 cm 1 corresponding to cn which was observed to have increased intensity in the aminated samples compared to raw biochar ultrasonication appeared to increase the cn peak intensity for the lowest concentration of koh us30 koh0 5 dea vs us0 koh0 5 dea but did not seem to make a significant difference with the higher concentrations of koh the reaction with amines may be facilitated in sonicated samples due to the presence of the pores as observed from the elemental composition analysis shown in table 3 the sem image showed the porous structure as well as the surface covered with amine 3 1 3 3 effect of nitric acid the effect of nitric acid concentration is presented in fig 6 higher concentrations of nitric acid increased the relative intensity of the oh related peak located at 3300 3600 cm 1 this observation is consistent with o content of the activated biochars however it must be highlighted that the intensities of these peaks are still much lower than those of raw biochar on the other hand dea functionalization caused a wide peak to appear at around 1250 1020 cm 1 this peak is related to cn bonds aliphatic amines it was similar in all aminated samples whether sonicated or not another small peak around 1250 1335 cm 1 which appeared most clearly for samples treated with 30 nitric acid can be ascribed to the presence of cn stretch of aromatic amines or nitro groups this increase is due to the attachment of n functional groups consistent with this ftir peak the elemental analysis for nitric acid treated dea functionalized biochar showed an increase in n content with increase in nitric acid concentration increase in n content could also be due to the nitrate ions trapped in the pores of the oxidized carbons 45 3 1 3 4 effect of phosphoric acid the effect of phosphoric acid concentration on amine functionalization of raw and ultrasonicated biochar is presented in fig 7 the ftir spectra of phosphoric acid treated samples includes mainly the same peaks as observed for nitric acid treated ones however the small cn stretch peak at 1250 1335 cm 1 aromatic amines nitro was not observed for these samples for nitric acid treated samples the intensity of the cn stretch peak at 1250 1020 cm 1 aliphatic amines was independent of sonication however in phosphoric acid treated samples sonicated samples showed more intensity in the 1250 1020 cm 1 region than unsonicated samples and more than hno3 treated samples this observation suggests the prominent role of acoustic activation prior to phosphoric acid treatment consistent with our recent studies emphasizing the role of ultrasonication in chemical activation of raw biochar 23 despite this elemental analysis showed significantly lower n content in samples treated with h3po4 compared to those with hno3 a possible explanation is that the cn peak may have overlapped with po containing functional group absorptions which usually appear at 9001260 cm 1 it has been reported that treatment of ground olive stones with phosphoric acid before pyrolysis results in a biochar with a higher proportion of micropores and cavities on the external surfaces mainly due to the evaporation of phosphoric acid activating agent and degradation of microstructure during the carbonization step 47 in a similar study performed by bailón garcía et al 48 the xps spectrum for oxygen suggested the presence of oxygen double bonded po groups and oxygen single bonded cop at another instance the xps spectrum of phosphonated go could be interpreted without assuming cp bonds but the xps indicated about 20 atom p in the sample suggesting a covalent attachment of phosphate to either o or c 49 assuming the covalent attachment of heteroatom to biochar frameworks our recently published work suggested the following possible reactions at different reaction sites onto the surface biochar 23 i the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by phosphate to form phosphate ester ii direct esterification of a phenolic hydroxyl group to form phosphate ester and iii direct phosphorylation of an aromatic ring by electrophilic aromatic substitution 23 3 1 4 effect on graphitic structure of biochar raman spectroscopy is a non destructive technique aimed to evaluate the nature of defects and disorders of carbon based materials fig 8 present the structural change of raw biochar us0 during its activation through different treatment methods the raman spectrum of raw biochar exhibits two characteristics peaks the d peak at around 1363 cm 1 and the g peak at 1642 cm 1 these are the characteristic peaks of graphitic sp2 structure and thus confirm the similarity of biochar with graphene oxide 50 the prominent d peak corresponds to the out of plane breathing modes of six atom rings in the presence of the structural imperfections created by the attachment of groups such as hydroxyl or epoxide on the carbon basal plane 51 52 the g peak is associated to the first order scattering of the e2g mode and refers to the in plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms in a 2d hexagonal lattice 53 usually the ratio of d to g band intensities id ig is used to indicate the graphitization degree of carbon materials in that the higher the id ig ratio the lower the graphitization degree this increase may either be attributed to the increase of surface defects in the basal plane or change in the basal plane functional groups 54 in the present work the id ig of raw biochar us0 was 0 83 while modified biochars varied between 0 84 and 0 86 table 4 showing that the graphitization degree is decreased following ultrasono chemical activation steps based on deconvolution of the raman spectra shown in fig 8 the id ig increased to 0 86 on ultrasonication us30 such an increase may be attributed to the increase of defects in the basal plane or exfoliation of biochar s graphitic structure due to ultrasonication it implies that cavitation or shockwaves produced as a result of ultrasound irradiations penetrate through the surface of biochar disorder the layers exfoliate its graphitic structure and result in transitions from sp2 to sp3 material 32 as observed us0 dea and us30 dea exhibited d peak at 1373 cm 1 and 1364 cm 1 and the g peak around 1602 18 cm 1 and 1606 18 cm 1 respectively on amine functionalization the d peak position shifted downward for us0 dea while it remain unchanged for us30 dea concomitantly the integrated id ig ratios changed to 0 86 us0 dea and 0 85 us30 dea respectively this indicates the incorporation of n containing groups in the biochar reducing its graphitization degree however the intensity of aminated biochars is significantly lower than unaminated samples which can be due to the increased absorption coefficient of the material due to amine grafting the intensity of raman scattered light is proportional to the number of scattering molecules irradiated by the incident light and inversely proportional to the absorption coefficient of the material compared with us0 dea us0 eh1 1 dea showed a slight decrease to 0 84 in id ig fig 9 displays the raman spectra patterns of koh activated unsonicated and ultrasonicated biochar samples obtained in the spectral range from 0 to 4000 cm 1 for us0 koh0 5 dea us0 koh1 5 dea and us0 koh3 dea samples the d peak was observed at 1357 cm 1 1377 cm 1 and 1379 cm 1 respectively and the g peak appeared around 1599 cm 1 1599 cm 1 and 1619 cm 1 respectively here it is noted that the intensity of g and d peaks were reduced in comparison with raw biochar which is mainly due to the activation of alcoholic phenolic or carboxylic groups and amine functionalization as is obvious from elemental composition analysis table 3 23 55 consequently the id ig ratios were 0 85 0 86 and 0 85 respectively compared with raw and amine treated samples us0 dea insignificant change in id ig ratio was observed the elemental composition showed slight reduction in carbon and hydrogen content while significant increase in ash content was noted these findings are consistent with those observed with edc hobt the effect of hno3 concentration on the graphitization degree of raw and ultrasonicated biochar is shown as fig 10 and the corresponding id ig ratios are provided in table 4 as observed hno3 did not have a significant effect on biochar surface defects as the id ig ratio remained within 0 01 of the ratio for aminated raw and ultrasonicated samples overall the intensity of g and d peaks were reduced in comparison with raw biochar 56 this is consistent with nitric acid treatment resulting in the oxidation of aromatic rings as per the reaction mechanism this activation step subsequently increases the carboxyl and oxygen content and these groups decrease the aromaticity of biochar structure on the other hand the corrosive nature of nitric acid removes a portion of defective carbons which may increase the aromaticity as a resultant of these two effects the id ig stayed roughly constant when nitric acid was used for biochar treatment the coupling effect of phosphoric acid treatment and amine functionalization on the graphitization degree of raw and ultrasonicated biochar is shown in fig 11 for us0 p10 dea us0 p20 dea and us0 p30 dea the d peak was observed around 1338 1363 56 and 1360 31 cm 1 while the g peak appeared around 1596 1598 and 1598 36 cm 1 respectively according to the results table 4 the id ig ratio changed slightly from 0 83 us0 to 0 84 p10 to 0 85 p20 with h3po4 loading for unsonicated biochar these changes showed the presence of more sp3 bonds and transition from sp2 to sp3 materials as a result of h3po4 activation increase of the h3po4 concentration to 30 didn t reduce the intensity of d and g peaks phosphoric acid treatment had no effect on the id ig ratio for sonicated aminated samples 3 2 adsorption 3 2 1 effect of ultrasonication the effect of ultrasonication on the adsorption characteristics of raw biochar is shown in fig 12 the adsorption curve for raw biochar us0 showed the maximum ni 2 uptake of 14 while 42 ni 2 removal was observed with the ultrasonicated sample us30 in both cases the maximum ni 2 removal was obtained within 1 h over longer durations leaching of ni 2 from the biochar back into solution was observed which reduced eventual ni 2 adsorption to 11 and 29 respectively for us0 and us30 samples after 8 h this implies that ultrasonication has a key role in developing the porous structure for maximum adsorption but it cannot prevent the leaching of adsorbed ni 2 over longer experimentation times however the situation is different following amine dea functionalization the adsorption curves for us0 dea and us30 dea in fig 12 showed final adsorption uptake of 29 and 26 respectively the adsorption mechanism of a heavy metal by amine groups is as follows 57 7 r n h 2 m 2 m r n h 2 2 though amination increased the adsorption uptake compared to raw biochar the value was lower than that of the us30 sample indicating that the functionalization blocked some of the pores generated by acoustic activation however leaching was not observed in the samples functionalized with dea which reached maximum absorption in 3 5 h these findings are consistent with those obtained in one of our recent works 23 3 2 2 effect of edc hobt activation biochars chemically activated with edc hobt before amination namely us0 eh1 1 dea and us30 eh1 1 dea had maximum metal uptake of 22 and 14 respectively fig 12 a rise in ni 2 over time indicated the leaching of ni 2 metal for the edc hobt activated samples the results showed that there was no advantage of using edc hobt as chemical activator prior to the amination step this is despite the elemental composition results that suggested that hobt edc contributed to attaching more amino groups to the biochar as the percent nitrogen content increased to 0 38 however the accompanying decrease in o content suggests the loss of other surface functional groups that can play a role in the adsorption of ni 2 this is also in agreement with previous researchers findings 58 the combination of edc hobt chemical activation followed by amine functionalization with ultrasound treatment resulted in a decrease of ni 2 adsorption from 42 for ultrasound alone to 23 furthermore for the samples us30 and us30 eh1 1 dea leaching of ni 2 was observed over longer durations in comparison with unsonicated samples the leaching effect was more pronounced and again showed the ineffectiveness of using ecd hobt as chemical activator for this application 3 2 3 effect of koh fig 13 describes the effect of koh pretreatment on the ni 2 adsorption capacity of aminated biochar samples the adsorption for the first hour was similar to that for us30 for all of the koh treated samples as observed there was a slight dependence on koh loading consistent with the role of both amino as well as carboxyl functional groups in enhancing the adsorption capacity 58 the modified samples removed 53 57 of ni 2 after 8 h while raw biochar removed only 10 over the same experimental duration as seen in fig 13 for each case the adsorption capacity for ni 2 increased rapidly in the first half hour thereafter increasing at a slower rate with no leaching of adsorbed ni 2 this may be due to the decrease in the number of active sites remaining in longer durations this finding is consistent with the results obtained in recently published works 59 60 concerning the attainments of equilibrium within 1 3 h in comparison with the results obtained by koh treated unsonicated biochar open symbols in fig 13 ultrasonication in combination with koh activation blue symbols witnessed an decrease in the maximum adsorption time from 8 h to 3 h with maximum ni 2 removal of 55 us30 koh0 5 dea furthermore leaching was not observed in koh treated samples with the ni 2 continuing to decrease or staying constant after 3 h as observed from the adsorption curves fig 13 for most koh concentrations and adsorption times the unsonicated and ultrasonicated samples had similar adsorption values although some improvement with sonication was seen at 3 and 5 h with the high and low loadings of koh this limited effect of ultrasound implies that koh treatment may tend to suppress the effect of ultrasound on the properties of biochar despite this observation the us30 sample treated with the lowest concentration of 0 5 koh showed the greatest positive effect 55 on the adsorption removal efficiency of biochar 3 2 4 effect of nitric acid treatment fig 14 shows the effect of nitric acid on the adsorption capacity of aminated biochar in comparison with us0 11 and us0 dea 26 a significant increase in ni 2 uptake to 57 was observed after 8 h using us0 n30 dea as adsorbent a negligible difference in ni 2 final adsorptions 55 57 was observed with hno3 loading these findings indicate that although acidic pretreatment of biochar with hno3 prior to amine functionalization significantly increases the adsorption capacity of biochar acid concentrations higher than 10 do not necessarily contribute to further improvement of the process in contrast the elemental composition analysis showed significant increases in both n 1 61 2 13 n and o 13 85 16 51 o content table 3 with increasing nitric acid concentration these increases may indicate nitrate ions trapped inside the pores of the biochar structure 45 in terms of adsorption rate the adsorption capacity increased rapidly in the first half hour and thereafter attained more gradual increments with no leaching of adsorbed ni 2 this suggests a decrease in the number of available active sites over longer durations and indicates the potential value of using shorter adsorption times following acid treatment treatment of biochar with ultrasound followed by different concentrations of nitric acid and amination us30 n30 dea resulted in up to 8 more adsorption in the early stages 1 5 h compared to unsonicated adsorbent in addition increase of hno3 concentration from 10 to 20 in ultrasound activated biochars resulted in a slight improvement in heavy metal uptake up to 4 in these early stages however further pretreating the biochar with 30 hno3 did not significantly contribute to further improving the ni 2 uptake though ultrasonication helped to exfoliate the biochar structure leaching out mineral content and increasing the microporous surface area the subsequent treatment of us30 with nitric acid may result in more nitrate ions trapped inside the porous structure 21 45 consistent with the findings of micropore analysis in table 2 the micropores which were expected to be increased through coupling the effects of ultrasonication and hno3 were instead decreased resulting in a limited improvement in ni 2 metal uptake 3 2 5 effect of phosphoric acid fig 15 shows the effects of phosphoric acid concentration on adsorption capacity of biochar increases in h3po4 concentration resulted in increases in the adsorption capacity of raw aminated biochar especially at middle stages of adsorption 3 5 h a maximum of 68 ni 2 metal removal 150 mg nicl2 l was obtained by us0 p30 dea after 8 h which was 6 times higher than that obtained for raw biochar 11 in one of our recent published works biochar that was activated under ultrasound irradiation pretreated with phosphoric acid and functionalized with urea rather than dea could completely remove ni 2 from a solution containing 100 mg nicl2 l of water 23 the higher ni 2 used in the current study was not tested but the use of dea rather than urea may enhance the biochar adsorption capacity compared with hno3 biochars treated with h3po4 demonstrated a better performance in adsorption of ni 2 ions a maximum metal uptake of 55 was observed for us0 n20 dea while us0 p20 dea demonstrated a maximum uptake of 67 ultrasonication allowed a maximum of 71 ni 2 removal using us30 p30 dea after 8 h somewhat higher than that obtained with us0 p30 dea ultrasonication coupled with h3po4 functionalization us30 p30 dea also allowed a reduction in the time required for substantial 68 removal of ni 2 to 3 h compared to 5 h for 66 removal with unsonicated us0 p30 dea as observed from the adsorption data fig 15 increases in h3po4 concentration from 10 to 20 to 30 significantly increased the metal uptake in both ultrasonicated and non sonicated samples with the biggest differences occurring over medium adsorption durations 3 5 h in case of nitric acid the trapping of nitrate ions inside the porous structure may result in the reduction of active sites for amine functionalization however h3po4 treatment coupled with ultrasonication may increase the availability of more active sites additionally p containing functional groups may also contribute to metal uptake these observations are consistent with both elemental composition analysis and ftir thus emphasizing the role of ultrasound in reducing the duration required for ni 2 metal uptake as with nitric acid and koh treatments leaching was not observed in longer adsorption durations clarifying the utility of h3po4 treatment in this process 4 conclusion biochar a carbon rich and porous material is derived from pyrolyzing lignocellulosic material in an oxygen limited environment specific surface area pore distribution surface functional groups and inorganic content are factors which play important roles in defining the metal adsorption behavior of biochar in order to exploit these factors a biochar treatment was performed in three stages i physical activation with ultrasound ii chemical activation with edc hobt base koh or one of two acids hno3 or h3po4 and iii functionalization with dea in the first stage ultrasound assisted physical activation induces microjets which penetrate through the biochar surface exfoliating and breaking the irregular shaped biochar to alter the surface area and pore distribution and also reducing the mineral content in the second stage chemical activation with varying concentrations was performed followed by amine functionalization with dea in the last stage as a result amine and oxygen containing functional groups increased on the biochar surface in this study maximum ni 2 removals of 57 60 71 were observed for sonicated koh hno3 and h3po4 treated amine functionalized biochars within 3 8 and 3 h of adsorption respectively in all cases sonication resulted in modest but consistent increases in absorption capacity this increase in adsorption capacity is consistent with the formation of ultrasound induced porosity which could provide new active sites for the grafting of amine and oxygen containing functional groups considering the prospects of using biochar as a sustainable and environment friendly adsorbent ultrasonic treatment for a short 30 s duration followed by chemical activation with h3po4 and functionalization with dea provides an efficient treatment

14099,phycoremediation of palm oil mill effluent pome using native microalgae promotes sustainable agricultural wastewater treatment technology however pome is characterized by a high amount of organic and inorganic compounds therefore the aim of this paper is to study the toxic effect of selected organic acetic acid butyric acid propionic acid formic acid oil and grease and inorganic copper compounds presence in pome on the microalgae population a mix culture of three native microalgae species consisted of coelastrella sp ukm 4 chlorella sp ukm 8 and scenedesmus sp ukm 9 were exposed for 120 h to different organic and inorganic substances then microalgae growth response the changes of ph and the half maximal effective concentration ec50 were studied for both short term 24 h and long term 96 h exposure the ec50 indicated that acetic butyric formic and propionic acids promote microalgae growth at both short and long term exposure survival rate 50 at all selected concentrations whereas copper as well as oil and grease suppress microalgae growth survival rate 50 during short term exposure the most favorable growth rates of microalgal were in the ph range of 7 9 these findings show that it is feasible to cultivate microalgae in pome with a suitable amount of organic and inorganic compound keywords mix culture microalgae toxicity pome ec50 ecotoxicology 1 introduction for the past decade palm oil mill effluent pome has been treated in a series of treatment pond that includes anaerobic aerobic or facultative ponds to reduce the contaminant level in wastewater before being flown to the river however these conventional methods are listed as non sustainable and non environmental friendly due to the discharge of a large amount of nutrientloaded waste into the water bodies contributing emission of greenhouse gaseous and air pollution 1 due to the worsening effect in environmental health the regulation implemented on industrialized discharge to be more stringent 2 in conjunction with zero waste management technologies every palm oil mill must take part in research and development for better waste management 3 4 recently there has been a great interest from researcher to obtain algal biomass grown in wastewater to minimize overall production cost as it can simultaneously offer a synergistic effect for wastewater nutrient removal carbon capture and production of valuable biomass for various commercial applications such as animal feed biofertilizer and biopharmaceutical products 5 a recent study conducted by 6 had proven that pome could be utilized as a growing medium for marine diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum and subsequently produce sulfated exopolysaccharide and nutrient removal it is also suggested that the optimum concentration of pome for microalgae cultivation is 30 as the growth rate could be inhibited beyond that concentration 6 to date phycoremediation has been used for over 70 years in wastewater treatment as it will further enhance the treatment activities through their efficient photosynthetic metabolism and effectively fix co2 7 however the amount of organic and inorganic materials in the wastewater sometimes can exceed the optimum acceptable level that microalgae can adapt therefore the knowledge of toxic effects and concentration of non inhibiting concentrations of wastewaters is important to retain a high biomass rate for high treatment capacity as characterized pome contains a high amount of organic materials and nutrients that make it as a potential low cost substrate for cultivating microorganism especially microalgae 8 however as per other wastewaters pome is also known to contain a certain range of inhibitors and toxicants roughly it consists of 0 6 0 7 palm oil 95 96 water 4 5 total solid and 2 4 suspended solids 9 according to 10 the nutrients in pome consist of 2726 mg l of cod 1270 mg l of toc 316 7 mg l of tn and 257 6 mg l of phosphate among these components there are compounds which can inhibit the growth of microalgae by reducing microalgae growth photosynthetic activity enzymatic activity and respiration 11 the cultivation of microalgae in pome is challenging since the dark brown pome inhibit light penetration however pome pre treatment i e chemical biological and mechanical pre treatment can be done prior to microalgae cultivation to permeate light to pass through hence appropriate microalgae selection is important in this study mixotrophic microalgae were used the advantage of using mixotrophic microalgae is it uses both inorganic and organic carbon sources under both photo autotrophic and heterotrophic process simultaneously 12 therefore if the pome unfavorable the microalgae mode switch to the heterotrophic mode and vice versa aquatic microalgae are often used in inhibition test than other types of aquatic organism because of its extremely sensitive to the wide range of pollutants 13 current ecotoxicology test using mix culture microalgae as biotest is still limited to monoculture mix culture is better in ecotoxicology as it is more realistic to mimic their real nature conditions 14 it can be severely affected by environmental changes and therefore can provide meaningful indicators of ecological change over short time scales 15 the toxicity inhibition level can be expressed in ec50 the half maximal effective concentration of the toxicant that inhibits the 50 of the algal growth 16 calculation of half maximal effective concentration ec50 for biomass cellular density corresponding to the exponential phase approximation of ec50 for growth rate allows us to estimate complete toxic effects on growth parameters an organic compound like acetic acid butyric acid propionic acid and formic acid are commonly found as pome by products it is listed as a volatile fatty acid vfa that can negatively impact the environment 17 however it also can become a source of carbon for some microalgae 18 several studies had also utilized pome as carbon for lipid production and pollutants removal carbon and nitrogen sources for food grade yeast biomass production carbon source for supporting ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in ammonia removal a substrate for bacteria to produce poly β hydroxyalkanoates biohydrogen and biomethane 19 24 excessive amounts of oil and grease in pome can hinder sedimentation which causes losses of biomass and overall affecting a reduction in the efficiency of treatment stations 25 hence an effective handling system of pome such as through phycoremediation is crucial and has been a great challenge for oil palm industries this work aims to evaluate the toxic effect of selected organic acetic acid butyric acid formic acid propionic acid copper and oil grease and inorganic copper compounds which are major constituents in pome towards microalgae population pome may contain a lot of nutrients therefore this research utilized bbm as growing media to see the sole effect of the selected toxicants on mix culture microalgae and the concentration range were selected based on the range presence in pome as a standard reference the test duration and the possible adaptation of the microalgae to the test material and their effect towards toxicants on physicochemical properties including ph during microalgae growth were investigated these results reveal the proposed potential toxic concentration of organic and inorganic materials that microalgae can tolerate in pome for wastewater treatment purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae and media preparation three inoculum mix culture species of native microalgae coelastrealla sp ukm4 kp691597 chlorella sp ukm8 kt452082 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 ku170547 which was previously isolated were prepared in a sterile condition

continuous illumination at 3000 lx the activated inoculum was kept in an active condition during the preparation of microalgae to achieve od 1 0 prior to inoculation the test microorganism flasks are shaken twice a day and placed in the culturing apparatus 2 2 standard chemical toxicants the concentration range of chemical toxicants in which the effects on the growth of microalgae are likely to occur may be determined based on the results from range finding tests for the final test six concentrations were tested based on the arrangement in a geometric series the concentration series should preferably cover the range causing 0 90 inhibition of algal and bacterial growth table 1 exhibits the characteristics of pome and test concentration range used in this experiment 2 3 incubation flasks

to ensure no sign of contamination thirty per cent 30 ml from the stock culture was inoculated into 250 ml conical flask and were top up with bbm until 100 ml the toxicants were added into the culture with their respective concentrations the cultures were then incubated in the incubator for 120 h at 25 c with 12 h 12 h illumination 3000 lx by white fluorescent lamps philips without aeration the salinity was maintained at 0 ppt and were monitored using a refractometer the flasks with mix culture of microalgaewere shaken twice a day and placed in the culturing apparatus the initial biomass was standardized at 100 mg l equivalent to 8 6 107 cfu ml all the experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 4 measurement and analytical test procedure determination 2 4 1 growth culture the growth of algae in test substances was determined by measurement of the optical density of a culture with a spectrophotometer at 685 nm meanwhile the biomass was measured by analysis of dry weight by using standard profile of od at 685 nm versus microalgae biomass concentration mg l the microalgal biomass was obtained daily from 15 ml of sample and centrifuged at 2862 g for 10 min prior to determine the dry cell weight dcw the cell concentration were measured using the varian cary 50 spectrophotometer with uv vis detector varian cary agilent santa clara ca usa then the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm micro fiberglass filters gf c the filtered biomass was dried at 105 c in a drying oven for 24 h and the weight was recorded the standard curve of optical density versus dry weight were constructed 2 4 2 toxicants growth curve analysis scatter plot with linear line was applied to optimize key factors affecting biomass concentration of microalgae scatter line plot was used to optimize the level of toxicants mg l and days 120 h on biomass concentration the response variable is biomass concentration x 100 mg l the inhibition by a toxic compound can be described with the following

the coefficient of determination r2 and its statistical significance is checked by the f test 2 4 3 half maximal effective concentration ec50 different concentrations of toxicants were used to culture mixed microalgae the biomass concentration of each culture in the triplicate samples was calculated by comparison with the biomass concentration in the control culture bbm in the absence of toxicants the average specific biomass concentration rate for a specific period was calculated as the survival rate average of specific biomass concentration was obtained from eq 2 31 over concentration mg l 32

operation 3 result and discussion 3 1 algae growth response curve to toxic substances the toxic effect of organic acetic acid butyric acid formic acid propionic acid and inorganic copper and oil grease on algal growth were examined by measurement of microalgae biomass concentration throughout cultivation as described by 36 non competitive inhibition indicates that transformation can occur at every concentration level of the inhibiting compound the inhibition was the dependent variable while the concentrations of organic and inorganic substances were the independent variables conflicting the other orders of reaction a zero order reaction has a rate that is independent of the concentration of the substances as such increasing or decreasing the concentration of the reacting algal species will not speed up or slow down the reaction rate as they have the same level of inhibition towards the algal cell the initial microalgae cell density in this experiments were kept constant at 100 mg l as shown in figs 1 and 2 from the results it was found that organic matters used in this experiment has a stimulant effect on microalgae growth at different concentrations aa was found as the best growth stimulant among tested concentration of aa fig 1a the highest biomass was observed during the exposure to the highest concentration of aa 4100 mg l the lowest biomass of microalgae at aa more than 3 0 100 mg l was observed at concentration of 3400 mg l which is still higher than the others which their lowest biomass nearly to zero according to 37 aa is one of the most common carbon sources for many microbial species including microalgae metabolically microalgae assimilate aa into coenzyme a to form acetyl coa for carbon skeletons of atp and nadh meanwhile butyric acid formic acid and propionic acid show a similar trend of response towards microalgae growth by showing a stimulant effect at lower concentrations and inhibition effect at the higher concentrations this might be because most of the single compound of fatty acids provide an additional carbon source for the growth of microalgae as explained by 38 39 aa could be toxic for many microorganisms at high concentrations with the exception to chlamydomonas mundana which proliferated in the presence of acetate for this reason aa is frequently used to buffer the ph value in bioreactors for microalgae culture pa on the other hands was suggested to provide oxaloacetate to the cells and therefore can improve the cellular growth 40 furthermore the mixotrophic nature of mix culture microalgae used in this experiment can heterotrophically utilize organic carbon sources to increase their biomass production the decline in microalgae biomass at the end of the experiment can be explained due to a depletion of nutrients overheating ph disturbance or contaminations an inorganic matter like copper fig 1e used in this experiment shows a negative impact on microalgae growth it can be seen that the additional copper in the growth media proportionally inhibits microalgae growth at any concentrations thus copper concentration should be kept low if the wastewater to be used as a media for microalgae culture as for oil grease fig 1f it may cause a reduction in microalgae growth as the amount increased however it does not contain any harmful effect on microalgae growth the declining growth phase in oil grease can be observed by the reduction of the cell division rate due to limiting factors such as nutrients and aeration supply the oil masked the surface of the media preventing the gas exchange and light penetration making the anaerobic condition for the microalgae the mixotroph algae in this experiment do not sustain anaerobic condition overall the organic matters have both positive and negative impact on the microalgae growth at a certain range of concentration by which aa becomes the most favorable towards the microalgae growth in contrast copper has a negative effect on the microalgae growth at any concentrations 3 2 effects of ph towards microalgae growth activity the effect of ph on microalgae growth was initially investigated in this study the ph reading for o g are not shown on this figure as ph meter is sensitive to high oil content the ph was a crucial factor influencing metabolic effect in microalgae cells ph 7 was used as the initial point for all analysis as at the neutral ph of most freshwater habitats ph 6 8 proton acidity is the most important component while mineral or organic acidity are minor contributors 41 two ph dependent conceptual models were proposed for test organisms based on observed responses to variable ph values fig 2a to 2e these include model i decreasing toxicity with increasing ph positive correlation model ii increasing toxicity with decreasing ph negative correlation 42 the effect of ph on microalgae growth as shown in fig 2a to 2e plays a crucial role as the ph decreases at 120 h exposure the survival rate decreases the growth rates for all five organic and inorganic matter exhibited a similar pattern over the ph range around ph 3 0 10 0 with the optimum ph values for growth obtained between ph 7 0 and 9 0 by comparing fig 1 and fig 2 algae growth rates decreased when the ph values drop below ph 5 in general ph values of 7 9 might be most conducive to increased algae production and minimizing invading organisms 43 the ph of acetic acid formic acid propionic acid and copper drop below neutral ph after 24 h exposure except for butyric acid butyric acid showed a slightly increase in ph after 24 h exposure and decrease its ph after 48 h exposure the same pattern can be observed for acetic acid formic acid and propionic acid after 72 h which the ph was increasing and started to fall back after 96 h exposure however butyric acid and copper continuoes to increase its ph until 120 h of exposure the mix culture microalgae used in this experiment seems to withstand low ph condition after manage to regain back their neutral ph after 72 h however at higher concentration of butyric acid 316 and 366 mg l propionic acid 650 and 800 mg l and copper 1 2 and 1 4 mg l the ph maintains in acidic condition ph 5 after 72 h according to 44 the nature of the freshwater microalgae are robust microorganism and it has a wide range of ph adaptation they can increase tolerance to acidic and alkaline ph as an adaptive response to widely fluctuating ph levels that occur commonly in many productive freshwater environments 45 the homeostasis maintained by proton efflux and influx mechanism of microalgae is based on the cell to the environment communication 44 46 microalgae can regulate their internal ph through proton exchange so whatever the extracellular ph may be the cytoplasmic ph always remains near neutral 44 besides microalgae cell wall and production of extracellular polysaccharide to neutralize basic conditions can protect microalgae cell from ph damage 44 47 in this study the reduction of ph values does affect the survival rate of mixed microalgae culture the previous report has shown that butyric acid at concentrations of 1 5 mm was found to be highly toxic corresponded to the ph values around 4 5 however it was relatively harmless at ph 6 on the other hand propionic acid was highly toxic within ph range around 4 6 48 the results obtained from this study support previous findings that the complex forms of the organic acids are more toxic this is due to the drop of ph values which corresponded to the low pka value in the media however some microalgae favor acidic condition which they may utilize this condition for better growth and survival these observations suggest that ph assessment over growth rates possess resistance and enhanced growth rate 3 3 half maximal effective concentration ec50 microalgae are particularly suitable for toxicity testing because they possess the majority of the same biochemical pathways as higher organisms half maximal toxicity concentration assessment on test organism are expressed in ec50 value for 24 h and 96 h the 24 h incubation could be used to measure short term toxicity while long term toxicity test incubation can be tested using 96 h incubation period 35 from the results achieved in this study microalgae showed different survival rate and responses towards the organic and inorganic compounds used in this experiment fig 3 linear line graph shows that all substances have negative slope graph except for acetic acid which has a positive slope the negative linear fit line shows that increasing substance concentration reduces survival rate whereas positive fit line shows vice versa from fig 3 the ec50 indicated that aa ba fa and pa promote microalgae growth at both short and long term exposure survival rate 50 at all selected concentrations whereas copper and oil grease suppress microalgae growth survival rate 50 during short term exposure this might be due to the sensitivity differences in uptake rates across the plasma membrane and internal binding mechanisms of microalgae towards toxicants 49 aa seems to have a high survival rate 100 at short term exposure and being highest 113 83 survival rate at a concentration of 4100 mg l p 0 05 during 96 h exposure as it is proven to be more easily consumed by several microorganisms by previous research as stated by 50 acetate is preferred during the early exponential phase for microalgae growth and their presence as an organic compound supplies nutrient assimilation for microalgae carbon skeleton the metabolic oxidation for aa and ba are very much the same except for butyrate uptake by microalgae is much slower and can reduce the microalgae growth when both are present it was found that at much higher concentrations above 500 ppm the y butyric acids were found to be highly toxic whereas the acetic acids have an inhibitory effect on growth 51 this explains why the survival rate in aa are much higher than ba during long term exposure fifty percent effective dose the ecological dose resulting in a 50 decrease in activity ec50 values in ba fa and pa significantly decreases p 0 05 from 24 hours 96 hours 896 68 mg l to 498 84 mg l 6108 79 mg l to 2412 28 mg l and 1798 34 mg l to 828 55 mg l respectively conversely the ec50 value for aa table 2 cu and o g significantly increases p 0 05 from 91 93 mg l to 1947 56 mg l 0 1766 mg l to 0 7485 mg l and 6402 14 mg l to 8901 83 mg l respectively through 24 hours 96 hours incubation fig 3 during the 24 h and 96 h exposure majority all of the organic matters survival rate above 50 whereas majority survival rate for o g and cu fall below 50 table 2 p 0 05 microalgae survive better in organic matter because they serve as carbon sources to support microalgae growth 18 while inorganic matter like copper always suppresses their growth by messing their metabolic pathway growth inhibition in microalgae is mainly related to free ions and its sensitivity varies among microalgae 52 as explained by 53 the effect of cu towards microalgae depends on the composition of culture medium experimental protocol and species used therefore direct comparison of sensitivity among microalgae due to copper exposure is difficult but can be minimized at least by using a similar experimental protocol cu often causes the generation of reactive species rs which cause algal growth and photosynthetic inhibition 54 it is proven that the increasing level of rs can lead to severe cellular injury or death to cells 55 52 55 reported that copper in ionic form is able to inhibit the synthesis of d aminolevulinic acid and protochlorophyllide reductase peroxidative breakdown of pigments and membrane lipids by reactive oxygen species at higher concentration thus causes chlorophyll α reduction from the results obtained algae have high toxicity tolerance due to its microorganism characteristics such as has a thicker cell wall being eukaryotic cell some microalgae can tolerate at a very high concentration of aa however ba also promotes the growth of microalgae at a very much lower concentration as compared to aa therefore it is somewhat to say that aa and ba could be used as a microalgae enhancer it is suggested that if the microalgae are to be cultured in wastewater containing both aa and ba the algal biomass can be manipulated either by increasing the initial mix culture biomass or by manipulating the initial acetate butyrate ratio 51 based on the comparison of previous studies on toxicity level 56 57 and shows that using mixed culture as test microorganism has better toxicity fortitude towards toxicants chemical substance as compared to using single culture mixed cultures consist of community dynamics where the competitive advantage of more tolerant ones resulted in a change in community composition and survival rate 4 conclusion the analysis of the data on toxic effects of organic and inorganic toxicants showed that ba fa and pa promote the growth of microalgae at a lower level whereas microalgae are more tolerant towards aa at a higher level oil and grease can be harmful to microalgae growth at high concentration but copper on the other hand suppress microalgae growth even at low concentration because of the dynamicity of microalgae it was hard to determine the actual value of the inhibition test this protocols also tend to have large variability in test result concerning the variation of physicochemical and biological parameters this study shows that generally no single toxicity test can be characterized as being more sensitive than the others in assessing the toxicity of pollutants to the microorganism attention must therefore be focused on the specific physicochemical abiotic factors of the recipient environment which may mediate or potentiate the toxicity of the contaminant acknowledgement the author want to thanks universiti kebangsaan malaysia yayasan sime darby ukm ysd chair

14099,phycoremediation of palm oil mill effluent pome using native microalgae promotes sustainable agricultural wastewater treatment technology however pome is characterized by a high amount of organic and inorganic compounds therefore the aim of this paper is to study the toxic effect of selected organic acetic acid butyric acid propionic acid formic acid oil and grease and inorganic copper compounds presence in pome on the microalgae population a mix culture of three native microalgae species consisted of coelastrella sp ukm 4 chlorella sp ukm 8 and scenedesmus sp ukm 9 were exposed for 120 h to different organic and inorganic substances then microalgae growth response the changes of ph and the half maximal effective concentration ec50 were studied for both short term 24 h and long term 96 h exposure the ec50 indicated that acetic butyric formic and propionic acids promote microalgae growth at both short and long term exposure survival rate 50 at all selected concentrations whereas copper as well as oil and grease suppress microalgae growth survival rate 50 during short term exposure the most favorable growth rates of microalgal were in the ph range of 7 9 these findings show that it is feasible to cultivate microalgae in pome with a suitable amount of organic and inorganic compound keywords mix culture microalgae toxicity pome ec50 ecotoxicology 1 introduction for the past decade palm oil mill effluent pome has been treated in a series of treatment pond that includes anaerobic aerobic or facultative ponds to reduce the contaminant level in wastewater before being flown to the river however these conventional methods are listed as non sustainable and non environmental friendly due to the discharge of a large amount of nutrientloaded waste into the water bodies contributing emission of greenhouse gaseous and air pollution 1 due to the worsening effect in environmental health the regulation implemented on industrialized discharge to be more stringent 2 in conjunction with zero waste management technologies every palm oil mill must take part in research and development for better waste management 3 4 recently there has been a great interest from researcher to obtain algal biomass grown in wastewater to minimize overall production cost as it can simultaneously offer a synergistic effect for wastewater nutrient removal carbon capture and production of valuable biomass for various commercial applications such as animal feed biofertilizer and biopharmaceutical products 5 a recent study conducted by 6 had proven that pome could be utilized as a growing medium for marine diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum and subsequently produce sulfated exopolysaccharide and nutrient removal it is also suggested that the optimum concentration of pome for microalgae cultivation is 30 as the growth rate could be inhibited beyond that concentration 6 to date phycoremediation has been used for over 70 years in wastewater treatment as it will further enhance the treatment activities through their efficient photosynthetic metabolism and effectively fix co2 7 however the amount of organic and inorganic materials in the wastewater sometimes can exceed the optimum acceptable level that microalgae can adapt therefore the knowledge of toxic effects and concentration of non inhibiting concentrations of wastewaters is important to retain a high biomass rate for high treatment capacity as characterized pome contains a high amount of organic materials and nutrients that make it as a potential low cost substrate for cultivating microorganism especially microalgae 8 however as per other wastewaters pome is also known to contain a certain range of inhibitors and toxicants roughly it consists of 0 6 0 7 palm oil 95 96 water 4 5 total solid and 2 4 suspended solids 9 according to 10 the nutrients in pome consist of 2726 mg l of cod 1270 mg l of toc 316 7 mg l of tn and 257 6 mg l of phosphate among these components there are compounds which can inhibit the growth of microalgae by reducing microalgae growth photosynthetic activity enzymatic activity and respiration 11 the cultivation of microalgae in pome is challenging since the dark brown pome inhibit light penetration however pome pre treatment i e chemical biological and mechanical pre treatment can be done prior to microalgae cultivation to permeate light to pass through hence appropriate microalgae selection is important in this study mixotrophic microalgae were used the advantage of using mixotrophic microalgae is it uses both inorganic and organic carbon sources under both photo autotrophic and heterotrophic process simultaneously 12 therefore if the pome unfavorable the microalgae mode switch to the heterotrophic mode and vice versa aquatic microalgae are often used in inhibition test than other types of aquatic organism because of its extremely sensitive to the wide range of pollutants 13 current ecotoxicology test using mix culture microalgae as biotest is still limited to monoculture mix culture is better in ecotoxicology as it is more realistic to mimic their real nature conditions 14 it can be severely affected by environmental changes and therefore can provide meaningful indicators of ecological change over short time scales 15 the toxicity inhibition level can be expressed in ec50 the half maximal effective concentration of the toxicant that inhibits the 50 of the algal growth 16 calculation of half maximal effective concentration ec50 for biomass cellular density corresponding to the exponential phase approximation of ec50 for growth rate allows us to estimate complete toxic effects on growth parameters an organic compound like acetic acid butyric acid propionic acid and formic acid are commonly found as pome by products it is listed as a volatile fatty acid vfa that can negatively impact the environment 17 however it also can become a source of carbon for some microalgae 18 several studies had also utilized pome as carbon for lipid production and pollutants removal carbon and nitrogen sources for food grade yeast biomass production carbon source for supporting ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in ammonia removal a substrate for bacteria to produce poly β hydroxyalkanoates biohydrogen and biomethane 19 24 excessive amounts of oil and grease in pome can hinder sedimentation which causes losses of biomass and overall affecting a reduction in the efficiency of treatment stations 25 hence an effective handling system of pome such as through phycoremediation is crucial and has been a great challenge for oil palm industries this work aims to evaluate the toxic effect of selected organic acetic acid butyric acid formic acid propionic acid copper and oil grease and inorganic copper compounds which are major constituents in pome towards microalgae population pome may contain a lot of nutrients therefore this research utilized bbm as growing media to see the sole effect of the selected toxicants on mix culture microalgae and the concentration range were selected based on the range presence in pome as a standard reference the test duration and the possible adaptation of the microalgae to the test material and their effect towards toxicants on physicochemical properties including ph during microalgae growth were investigated these results reveal the proposed potential toxic concentration of organic and inorganic materials that microalgae can tolerate in pome for wastewater treatment purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae and media preparation three inoculum mix culture species of native microalgae coelastrealla sp ukm4 kp691597 chlorella sp ukm8 kt452082 and scenedesmus sp ukm9 ku170547 which was previously isolated were prepared in a sterile condition in two liter schott bottle using the sterile bold basal medium bbm all chemical component of test medium used were dissolved in ultrapure milli ro water kemflo aicro q water filters usa and adjusted

continuous illumination at 3000 lx the activated inoculum was kept in an active condition during the preparation of microalgae to achieve od 1 0 prior to inoculation the test microorganism flasks are shaken twice a day and placed in the culturing apparatus 2 2 standard chemical toxicants the concentration range of chemical toxicants in which the effects on the growth of microalgae are likely to occur may be determined based on the results from range finding tests for the final test six concentrations were tested based on the arrangement in a geometric series the concentration series should preferably cover the range causing 0 90 inhibition of algal and bacterial growth table 1 exhibits the characteristics of pome and test concentration range used in this experiment 2 3 incubation flasks of bbm containing toxicants test 1 6 table 1 were inoculated with a mixed culture of microalgae the algal morphology were checked regularly using olympus bx51 microscope olympus center valley pa usa to ensure no sign of contamination thirty per cent 30 ml from the stock culture was inoculated into 250 ml conical flask and were top up with bbm until 100 ml the toxicants were added into the culture with their respective concentrations the cultures were then incubated in the incubator for 120 h at 25 c with 12 h 12 h illumination 3000 lx by white fluorescent lamps philips without aeration the salinity was maintained at 0 ppt and were monitored using a refractometer the flasks with mix culture of microalgaewere shaken twice a day and placed in the culturing apparatus the initial biomass was standardized at 100 mg l equivalent to 8 6 107 cfu ml all the experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 4 measurement and analytical test procedure determination 2 4 1 growth culture the growth of algae in test substances was determined by measurement of the optical density of a culture with a spectrophotometer at 685 nm meanwhile the biomass was measured by analysis of dry weight by using standard profile of od at 685 nm versus microalgae biomass concentration mg l the microalgal biomass was obtained daily from 15 ml of sample and centrifuged at 2862 g for 10 min prior to determine the dry cell weight dcw the cell concentration were measured using the varian cary 50 spectrophotometer with uv vis detector varian cary agilent santa clara ca usa then the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm micro fiberglass filters gf c the filtered biomass was dried at 105 c in a drying oven for 24 h and the weight was recorded the standard curve of optical density versus dry weight were constructed 2 4 2 toxicants growth curve analysis scatter plot with linear line was applied to optimize key factors affecting biomass concentration of microalgae scatter line plot was used to optimize the level of toxicants mg l and days 120 h on biomass concentration the response variable is biomass concentration x 100 mg l the inhibition by a toxic compound can be described with the following model for non competitive inhibition on the assumption that the inhibition is zero order 1 k o b s t o x k m a x s i c s i c s i where si is concentration of inhibiting compound mg 1 si c is

30 the statistical software sigmaplot14 version 14 0 san jose ca usa is used for regression and graphical analysis of the experimental data the quality of fit of the quadratic model is expressed by the coefficient of determination r2 and its statistical significance is checked by the f test 2 4 3 half maximal effective concentration ec50 different concentrations of toxicants were used to culture mixed microalgae the biomass concentration of each culture in the triplicate samples was calculated by comparison with the biomass concentration in the control culture bbm in the absence of toxicants the average specific biomass concentration rate for a specific period was calculated as the survival rate average of specific biomass concentration was obtained from eq 2 31 over concentration mg l 32 then it was plotted using sigma plot software 14 0 systat software inc usa and half maximal toxicity was calculated using linear regression line equation 3 33 35 for each substance 2 c e l l s u r v i

operation 3 result and discussion 3 1 algae growth response curve to toxic substances the toxic effect of organic acetic acid butyric acid formic acid propionic acid and inorganic copper and oil grease on algal growth were examined by measurement of microalgae biomass concentration throughout cultivation as described by 36 non competitive inhibition indicates that transformation can occur at every concentration level of the inhibiting compound the inhibition was the dependent variable while the concentrations of organic and inorganic substances were the independent variables conflicting the other orders of reaction a zero order reaction has a rate that is independent of the concentration of the substances as such increasing or decreasing the concentration of the reacting algal species will not speed up or slow down the reaction rate as they have the same level of inhibition towards the algal cell the initial microalgae cell density in this experiments were kept constant at 100 mg l as shown in figs 1 and 2 from the results it was found that organic matters used in this experiment has a stimulant effect on microalgae growth at different concentrations aa was found as the best growth stimulant among tested concentration of aa fig 1a the highest biomass was observed during the exposure to the highest concentration of aa 4100 mg l the lowest biomass of microalgae at aa more than 3 0 100 mg l was observed at concentration of 3400 mg l which is still higher than the others which their lowest biomass nearly to zero according to 37 aa is one of the most common carbon sources for many microbial species including microalgae metabolically microalgae assimilate aa into coenzyme a to form acetyl coa for carbon skeletons of atp and nadh meanwhile butyric acid formic acid and propionic acid show a similar trend of response towards microalgae growth by showing a stimulant effect at lower concentrations and inhibition effect at the higher concentrations this might be because most of the single compound of fatty acids provide an additional carbon source for the growth of microalgae as explained by 38 39 aa could be toxic for many microorganisms at high concentrations with the exception to chlamydomonas mundana which proliferated in the presence of acetate for this reason aa is frequently used to buffer the ph value in bioreactors for microalgae culture pa on the other hands was suggested to provide oxaloacetate to the cells and therefore can improve the cellular growth 40 furthermore the mixotrophic nature of mix culture microalgae used in this experiment can heterotrophically utilize organic carbon sources to increase their biomass production the decline in microalgae biomass at the end of the experiment can be explained due to a depletion of nutrients overheating ph disturbance or contaminations an inorganic matter like copper fig 1e used in this experiment shows a negative impact on microalgae growth it can be seen that the additional copper in the growth media proportionally inhibits microalgae growth at any concentrations thus copper concentration should be kept low if the wastewater to be used as a media for microalgae culture as for oil grease fig 1f it may cause a reduction in microalgae growth as the amount increased however it does not contain any harmful effect on microalgae growth the declining growth phase in oil grease can be observed by the reduction of the cell division rate due to limiting factors such as nutrients and aeration supply the oil masked the surface of the media preventing the gas exchange and light penetration making the anaerobic condition for the microalgae the mixotroph algae in this experiment do not sustain anaerobic condition overall the organic matters have both positive and negative impact on the microalgae growth at a certain range of concentration by which aa becomes the most favorable towards the microalgae growth in contrast copper has a negative effect on the microalgae growth at any concentrations 3 2 effects of ph towards microalgae growth activity the effect of ph on microalgae growth was initially investigated in this study the ph reading for o

after 96 h exposure however butyric acid and copper continuoes to increase its ph until 120 h of exposure the mix culture microalgae used in this experiment seems to withstand low ph condition after manage to regain back their neutral ph after 72 h however at higher concentration of butyric acid 316 and 366 mg l propionic acid 650 and 800 mg l and copper 1 2 and 1 4 mg l the ph maintains in acidic condition ph 5 after 72 h according to 44 the nature of the freshwater microalgae are robust microorganism and it has a wide range of ph adaptation they can increase tolerance to acidic and

protocols also tend to have large variability in test result concerning the variation of physicochemical and biological parameters this study shows that generally no single toxicity test can be characterized as being more sensitive than the others in assessing the toxicity of pollutants to the microorganism attention must therefore be focused on the specific physicochemical abiotic factors of the recipient environment which may mediate or potentiate the toxicity of the contaminant acknowledgement the author want to thanks universiti kebangsaan malaysia yayasan sime darby ukm ysd chair
