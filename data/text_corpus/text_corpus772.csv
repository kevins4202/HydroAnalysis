3860,normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is an important indicator reflecting the state of regional climate and environment which is affected by precipitation temperature soil water content and so on this study analyzed the influence of different factors on ndvi through the spearman correlation coefficient scc and standard regression coefficient src carried out climate zoning in china through principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis simulated the ndvi value through deep learning algorithm and analyzed the spatial mutation positions of different factors through concept drift detection the research results show that the main factor that affects ndvi in most areas of china is surface soil moisture ssm followed by temperature while in arid areas root zone soil moisture rzsm and profile soil moisture psm are the main influencing factors the climate zones of china can be roughly divided into northern southern and northwestern inland areas while there are transitional zones between different main zones the deep learning algorithm can simulate the ndvi value very well and the nash efficiency coefficients nse during training and verification periods are 0 893 and 0 833 respectively however the details of some areas are rough this shows that the selected impact factors can basically determine the status of ndvi and these impact factors can be used to predict the changes in ndvi the environmental drift areas discovered by concept drift detection are mainly in the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china yunnan sichuan and southern tibet in southwestern china and gansu qinghai and xinjiang in northwestern china this study provides an important reference for the analysis of environmental regional zoning climate change detection and simulation keywords correlation analysis principal component analysis clustering analysis deep learning concept drift detection 1 introduction normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a commonly used vegetation index which can monitor vegetation growth status and vegetation coverage french et al 2020 ghebrezgabher et al 2020 shammi and meng 2021 since ndvi algorithm can eliminate most of the irradiance changes related to instrument calibration sun angle topography cloud shadows and atmospheric conditions and enhance the response to vegetation it is currently most widely used in more than 40 vegetation indices gim et al 2020 spadoni et al 2020 wu et al 2021 liu et al 2020b ndvi also has many applications in hydrology such as monitoring changes in drought conditions as input variables for hydrological models monitoring changes in water levels in rivers lakes reservoirs and so on garcía gamero et al 2021 grodek et al 2020 li et al 2020 generally vegetation grows densely in areas with sufficient water and heat such as tropical rain forest areas han et al 2019 moreno et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 vegetation growth is affected by many factors for example in the savanna areas of africa there is sufficient heat however due to scarce precipitation the trees are sparse campagnolo et al 2021 chapungu et al 2020 dairel and fidelis 2020 affected by human activities especially in urban areas the vegetation coverage has dropped significantly compared with the original state chu et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2019 piedallu et al 2019 the growth state of vegetation is a comprehensive response to the climate environment and can reflect its changing trend huang et al 2020 nanzad et al 2019 pang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 many studies use ndvi to analyze changes in the regional ecological environment changes in land use and the impact of human activities on the natural environment maneja et al 2020 shi et al 2021 by using trend analysis mutation analysis correlation analysis and wavelet analysis the vegetation cover change trend and its related influencing factors can be studied li et al 2021 neeti et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 in recent years models based on machine learning and artificial neural networks have also been applied to the simulation and prediction of regional ndvi changes bui et al 2020 liu et al 2020c tien bui et al 2020 yin et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the natural environment of different regions in china varies greatly hu et al 2008 sun et al 2016 zhu et al 2011 the state of vegetation coverage is affected by various conditions such as temperature precipitation topography light and human activities different regions have different factors that play a leading role in vegetation wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 this study extracted the precipitation temperature self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi surface soil moisture ssm root zone soil moisture rzsm profile soil moisture psm and ndvi data of china in 2018 through correlation analysis principal component analysis pca clustering deep learning concept drift methods the impact of different factors on ndvi was analyzed this study contributes to in depth understand the regional climate environmental status distribution and climate environmental changes of china 2 methods and data 2 1 study area china is located in the east of asia on the west coast of the pacific ocean 73 40 135 05 e 3 51 53 33 n with a land area of approximately 9 6 million km2 the terrain of china is distributed in an obvious three level ladder fig 1 the first ladder is the qinghai tibet plateau with an average elevation of more than 4000 m above sea level a s l the second ladder is between 1000 and 2000 m a s l mainly high mountain landforms and the third ladder is below 500 m a s l and the landform is dominated by plains and hills liu et al 2020 due to the large differences in the distance from the sea in different regions combined with the diverse terrain types and mountain directions thus form a diverse climate environment in china sun et al 2020 in terms of climate type the eastern part has a monsoon climate which can be divided into tropical monsoon climate subtropical monsoon climate and temperate monsoon climate the northwest has a temperate continental climate and the qinghai tibet plateau has an alpine climate cai et al 2021 from the division of temperature zones there are tropical subtropical warm temperate medium temperate cold temperate and qinghai tibet plateau regions wang et al 2017 from the perspective of the division of wet and dry regions there are humid regions semi humid regions semi arid regions and arid regions wei et al 2020 the regional environment is affected by many factors such as topography land and sea location atmospheric circulation and so on therefore even in the same climate type there also have differences in heat and wetness the complexity of the terrain also makes the climate more complex and diverse complicated landform types diverse climatic environments and the impact of human activities have resulted in significant differences in vegetation coverage in different regions of china 2 2 data the data used in this study are ndvi precipitation temperature soil moisture and drought index data of china in 2018 the ndvi data was extracted from the united states geological survey usgs land standard data product mod13c2 v006 data set and resampled https lpdaac usgs gov products mod13c2v006 the precipitation and temperature data was downloaded from china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn zhong et al 2020 the soil moisture data was obtained from the global land surface state variable data set provided by the global land data assimilation system gldas https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets the scpdsi index is improved on the basis of the palmer drought severity index pdsi which takes into account the climatic characteristics of different sites so that the persistence factor and the climate weighting factor are automatically corrected according to local characteristics ayantobo and wei 2019 the scpdsi value generally varies between 5 dry and 5 humid the scpdsi data set was provided by the east anglia climatic research unit in the united kingdom https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought because the spatial resolutions of different data sets are inconsistent the spatial resampling method was used to unify all data to a resolution of 0 5 0 5 and project them to the same coordinate system 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 spearman correlation and standardized regression coefficients spearman correlation coefficient scc is a coefficient that measures the correlation between variables based on ranked data and is a no parameter test method pastén zapata et al 2020 it uses a monotonic equation to evaluate the correlation between two statistical variables spearman s rank correlation coefficient does not require strict data conditions it only requires that the observations of the two variables are paired rating data or converted from continuous variable observations and it has no requirements on the overall distribution of data and sample size if there is a strict monotonic relationship between the two variables the spearman rank correlation coefficient is 1 or 1 at that time the two variables have completely spearman rank correlation it is worth noting that the pearson correlation coefficient can only reflect the linear relationship between the two variables so this study uses the scc in order to eliminate the influence of the data scale the zero mean normalization method is used to standardize the data the calculation formula of spearman s correlation coefficient is as follows 1 corr s i x i x y i y i x i x 2 i y i y 2 where corr s is spearman s correlation coefficient x i and y i are the average of the descending position of each original data x and y are the average values of x i and y i respectively in practical applications the link between variables is irrelevant so corr s can be calculated by the following formula 2 corr s 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where d i x i y i n is the number of variable elements the standard regression coefficient src refers to the regression coefficient after eliminating the scale influence of the dependent variable and the independent variable liu et al 2020d the absolute value of the regression coefficient directly reflects the degree of influence that the independent variable has on the dependent variable the larger the absolute value of the src the greater the degree of influence on the dependent variable and the positive or negative value represents the direction of influence on the dependent variable the calculation formula is as follows 3 y α x 1 β x 2 γ x 3 δ x 4 θ where y is the independent variable x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 are the independent variables α β γ and δ are the standardized regression coefficients corresponding to the independent variables and θ is the residual 2 3 2 pca and clustering this study includes the dependent variable ndvi and 6 independent variables a total of 7 variables on the premise of retaining the main information of the data the pca method was used to convert high dimensional data into low dimensional data mahmoudi et al 2021 and through cluster analysis the climate and environment classification status in china were revealed pca is a multivariate statistical method it is one of the most commonly used dimensionality reduction methods a set of potentially correlated variable data is transformed into a set of linearly independent variables through orthogonal transformation the variables are called principal components the calculation formula is mainly as follows 4 z 1 z 2 z 3 z k x 1 x 2 x 3 x d y 11 y 12 y 13 y 1 d y 21 y 22 y 23 y 2 d y 31 y 32 y 33 y 3 d y k 1 y k 2 y k 3 y kd where z is the k dimensional principal component x is the d dimensional original data and y is the d k dimensional conversion matrix generally k d clustering algorithm is a typical unsupervised learning algorithm which is mainly used to automatically classify similar samples into a category liu et al 2020 in the clustering algorithm the samples are divided into different categories according to the similarity between the samples the commonly used similarity calculation method is the euclidean distance method commonly used clustering algorithms are k means clustering hierarchical clustering density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan because k means clustering principle is simple easy to implement and the classification effect is better so it is more widely used li et al 2021 liu et al 2020 the main calculation step is to determine the optimal classification category through the elbow algorithm and then randomly select the initial point as the centroid and by calculating the similarity between each sample and the centroid the sample points are classified into the most similar class by recalculating the centroid of each class this process is repeated until the centroid no longer changes and finally the class to which each sample belongs and the centroid of each class are determined 2 3 3 deep learning algorithm deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on artificial neural networks dixit and silakari 2021 different from traditional machine learning deep learning requires more samples in exchange for fewer manual annotations and higher accuracy deep learning uses depth to replace breadth further reduces parameters and improves fitting capabilities in many cases it performs better than traditional machine learning the basic models in deep learning are roughly divided into three categories multilayer perceptron models deep neural network models and recurrent neural network models huang et al 2020 its representatives are deep belief network dbn convolution neural network cnn and recurrent neural network rnn fig 2 illustrates the structure diagram of a typical deep learning neural network which is composed of an input layer an output layer and multiple hidden layers each hidden layer contains multiple neurons to process the data the complex network layer can simulate almost any kind of function changes the main task of deep learning is to classify and predict data 2 3 4 concept drift detection concept drift refers to the unpredictable changes in the potential data distribution in the data stream over time which makes the original classifiers inaccurate or the decision making system unable to make correct decisions babüroğlu et al 2021 concept drift can be divided into virtual concept drift and real concept drift when the real concept drift occurs it indicates that the original model can no longer accurately simulate and predict the current data in concept drift detection algorithms classification accuracy is usually used as a criterion for judging whether concept drift occurs bui et al 2020 wei et al 2020 in the regression problem the concept drift is detected by the mean square error index of the predicted value and the true value in classification or regression problems there may be abnormal prediction values however a small amount of outliers does not represent the occurrence of concept drift so the measurement of concept drift through learning accuracy must be robust enough and not too sensitive page hinckley test is an error detection algorithm based on the cumulative error rate which can detect whether the data fluctuates and at the same time a small amount of outliers will not affect the error detection similar to the time data stream spatial data can be extracted as a spatial data stream according to the spatial coordinate position fig 3 illustrates the concept drift detection process of the spatial data stream marking the points in the space where the concept drift occurs the spatial distribution of the concept drift region can be depicted through concept drift monitoring the location of sudden changes in regional climate and environment can be found 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal distribution pattern of the variables the spatio temporal distribution of monthly precipitation in china in 2018 is shown in fig 4 a the precipitation is mainly concentrated from may to august and the southern part has more precipitation than the northern part and the entire northwestern inland area has sparse precipitation throughout the year fig 4b shows the spatio temporal distribution of monthly average temperature in china in 2018 the distribution of temperature is similar to that of precipitation the temperature in the south is high and lasts for a long time while the temperature in the north is low and the duration of high temperature weather is short the northeast and northwest regions are extremely cold in winter with temperatures as low as 30 c in some areas from the spatio temporal distribution of monthly scpdsi in china in 2018 fig 4c it shows the southern and northwestern regions are wetter than before while the northern regions are even drier than before except for liaoning which is more arid than before other parts of northeast china are wetter than before fig 4d and e and f depict the spatio temporal distribution of ssm rzsm and psm in china in 2018 respectively overall the soil moisture in the south is high followed by the songhua river basin in the northeast the soil in northwest and inner mongolia is relatively dry while the tarim basin is the driest area from the spatio temporal distribution characteristics of monthly average ndvi in china in 2018 fig 5 it shows that the vegetation coverage in the southern region is the highest followed by the northern and northeastern regions and the inland northwestern region has a low vegetation coverage the vegetation coverage is high in summer and low in spring autumn and winter on the whole the vegetation coverage in china shows a similar pattern to the distribution of water and heat the southern region has sufficient rain and heat making high vegetation coverage while north and northeast china have reduced water and heat making low vegetation coverage the inland areas of northwestern china have sparse rainfall and a harsh climate which restricts the growth of vegetation the qinghai tibet plateau has a severe cold climate and is not suitable for plant growth 3 2 spatial correlation analysis 3 2 1 scc distribution analysis fig 6 a shows that the scc between ndvi and precipitation are positively correlated in most areas of china however the correlation between precipitation and ndvi is not very high in some parts of the south which may be related to the fact that these areas are agricultural areas and the water needed by crops can be supplemented by irrigation ndvi is positively correlated with temperature in most areas of china fig 6b however ndvi is negatively correlated with temperature in some parts of the northwest china this may be due to excessive temperature will accelerate the loss of water in the northwestern inland areas where precipitation is scarce which is not conducive to plant growth fig 6c shows that ndvi and scpdsi are negatively correlated in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and most area of xinjiang while ndvi and scpdsi are strongly positively correlated in the north china plain and southwest china fig 6d and e and f illustrate the spatial distribution characteristics of the sccs of ssm rzsm psm with ndvi respectively on the whole soil water content at different depths has roughly the same effect on vegetation in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river most areas of xinjiang and some areas of the northeast china ndvi is negatively correlated with soil moisture while ndvi is positively correlated with soil moisture in southwest china north china and tibet this indicates that excessive soil water in some areas is not conducive to the growth of vegetation from fig 7 a it can been seen that the selected variables have a strong correlation effect on ndvi corrs 0 75 while in southeastern xinjiang and a small part of southern china the scc that has the greatest influence on ndvi is negative the spatial distribution of the factors corresponding to the largest scc is shown in fig 7b it can be seen that the temperature has the strongest correlation with ndvi in most areas of china meanwhile in yunnan southern tibet guangdong guangxi and hainan coastal areas ssm has the strongest correlation with ndvi the correlations of scpdsi and rzsm with ndvi are the strongest in the inland areas of northwest china this shows that in areas with abundant precipitation temperature has the greatest impact on ndvi and areas with abundant sunlight ssm have the greatest impact on ndvi in areas with arid climate drought and deep groundwater content have the greatest impact on ndvi 3 2 2 src distribution analysis from the src of precipitation to ndvi fig 8 a it shows precipitation in tibet and northeast china has a large impact on ndvi while precipitation in some parts of xinjiang has a large negative impact on ndvi the temperature in southeastern china has a large impact on ndvi while the temperature in parts of northwest china has a large negative impact on ndvi fig 8b the influence of temperature in other regions on ndvi is relatively weak fig 8c shows that the scpdsi in the inland areas of northwest china has a large and negative impact on ndvi it indicates that the drought in the inland areas of northwest china will seriously reduce the vegetation coverage fig 8d and e and f illustrate the spatial distribution of the src of ssm rzsm and psm to ndvi respectively it can be seen from the figure that ndvi is greatly affected by soil water content in xinjiang and part of southwest china while the impact on other regions is relatively weak it shows that the spatial distribution of the effect of soil water on ndvi is relatively consistent and most of them are positive feedback effects the spatial distribution of the maximum absolute value src of these factors to ndvi is shown in fig 9 a it can be seen from the figure that the src of the lop nur area in xinjiang and part of southwestern china are abnormally large while the src of other regions are relatively stable from the id spatial distribution of the maximum absolute value src of the variables to ndvi fig 9b the temperature has the greatest impact on ndvi in eastern china and northern xinjiang ssm has the largest impact on ndvi in southwest china and northwest china and precipitation has the largest impact on ndvi in northern tibet while in shaanxi and western inner mongolia rzsm and psm have a greater impact on ndvi this shows the factors that restrict plant growth are different in different regions for the healthy growth of plants the southern regions need to focus on the impact of temperature the northern regions need to focus on the impact of precipitation and the dry regions need to focus on the impact of soil moisture 3 3 clustering based on principal component analysis reducing the dimensions of 7 factors including ndvi into one principal component dimension through principal component analysis can reflect more comprehensively the spatial distribution characteristics of multi factor integration from the distribution of the first principal component pca1 in space fig 10 the regional climate environment of china can divide into three major regions the southeast region the north and northeast regions and the northwest region from the perspective of basic climate and environment distribution these three sub regions basically represent regional climate and environment distribution in china the southeast region is rich in rain and heat and the climate is mild the precipitation and sunlight in north china and northeast china have been reduced the northwest inland areas have sparse precipitation and harsh climate conditions fig 11 shows the result by using elbow method to find the optimal number of classifications when the number of classifications is 6 the intra cluster error has become very small and as the number of classifications increases the intra cluster error will not decrease significantly so 6 is selected as the optimal number of classifications the spatial clustering results of the first principal component fig 12 are basically consistent with the spatial variable distribution shown in fig 10 the basic partition is divided into three major categories and there is a transition zone between the basic partitions southeastern china is grouped into one category though the coastal areas have a few variations north china northeast china and southwest china are grouped into one category and the northwestern china inland areas are grouped into one category it is worth noting that the taklimakan desert and the mu us desert are grouped into one category and the liaodong peninsula is also grouped into this category which shows that the climate and environment of the liaodong peninsula have significantly increased aridity the silhouette analysis method is used to quantitatively analyze the clustering quality fig 13 is the silhouette analysis evaluation result of the clustering result it shows the clustering results are good and the average value of the silhouette coefficient is 0 573 among them the classification results of the second and sixth categories are the best and the fifth category has a small number of negative points indicating that some areas are incorrectly classified into the fifth category 3 4 ndvi simulation based on deep learning in order to show that the selected influencing factors can basically determine the change of ndvi a deep learning algorithm was used to calculate ndvi through these influencing factors 70 of the data was randomly selected from the spatial data stream as the training data 30 of the rest data was used as validation data the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r2 and spearman rank correlation coefficient srcc during the training period are 0 073 0 053 and 0 893 0 923 0 945 respectively fig 14 a and b this shows the simulation effect during the training period is very good the rmse mae nse r2 and srcc in the validation period are 0 085 0 063 0 833 0 90 0 913 respectively fig 14c and d this shows the model simulation effect in the validation period is still very good but slightly worse than the training period from the spatial distribution of the relative error between the simulated ndvi based on deep learning and the actual ndvi fig 15 a the simulated ndvi value in coastal areas is higher than the actual value while the simulated ndvi value in northeast china northwest xinjiang and southwest china is lower than the actual value the simulated ndvi has a significant linear relationship with the actual ndvi and the decisive coefficient is as high as 0 91 fig 15b this shows that the method based on deep learning can simulate the ndvi value very well and provides an effective method for simulating and predicting the change of the ndvi value fig 15c and d show the spatial distribution diagrams of actual ndvi and simulated ndvi respectively the simulated ndvi is basically the same as the actual ndvi distribution southern china has high vegetation coverage north china and northeast china have reduced vegetation coverage and northwestern china inland areas have the lowest vegetation coverage from the perspective of detailed description the simulated ndvi is not accurate enough in some areas for example in northwestern xinjiang northeast china the simulated value is low while the simulated value in the southeast china coastal area is high without considering the impact of urbanization on vegetation coverage 3 5 concept drift detection through the spatial concept drift detection 2 09 of the area has a sudden change in precipitation fig 16 a it can be seen that northeast china southwest china and qinghai tibet are the areas with the most significant precipitation changes fig 16b illustrates the conceptual drift of temperature in space occurred in 4 05 of the area the heilongjiang river basin in northeast china yunnan province in southwest china qinghai and tibet anhui and jiangsu in the eastern china are the main areas where temperature changes have occurred the concept drift of scpdsi in china accounts for 0 97 fig 16c it can be seen from the figure that the concept drift areas of scpdsi are relative less than other factors and mainly occur in liaoning shaanxi and yunnan provinces fig 16d and e f depict the spatial concept drift detection results of ssm rzsm and psm occurred in 1 91 1 65 and 1 75 of the area respectively it can be seen from the figure that the conceptual drift regions of ssm rzsm and psm are roughly the same it mainly occurs in the heilongjiang river basin in northeast china southeast china qinghai tibet and xinjiang the spatial concept drift detection result of ndvi is shown in fig 17 occurred in 2 82 of the area it can be seen from the figure that the main areas where the concept drift of ndvi occurs are the heilongjiang river basin in northeast china anhui and jiangsu in eastern china and qinghai and tibet in western china the spatial concept drift detection result of the scc between precipitation and ndvi is shown in fig 18 a occurred in 1 96 of the area it can be seen that the upper reaches of heilongjiang river basin in northeast china the liaodong peninsula zhejiang in east china and xinjiang in northwest china are the main areas where concept drift occurs the scc between temperature and ndvi has a concept drift of 1 86 of the area fig 18b the lower reaches of the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china the liaodong peninsula zhejiang and fujian in eastern china and xinjiang and tibet in northwestern china are the main areas of conceptual drift fig 18c e and f illustrate the spatial concept drift detection results of the sccs of scpdsi ssm rzsm psm with ndvi respectively it can be seen from the figure that the spearman correlation coefficients between these factors and ndvi have no concept drift the spatial concept drift result of the src of precipitation to ndvi is shown in fig 19 a concept drift occurred in 1 36 of china it can be seen that concept drift mainly occurs in the upper reaches of the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china jiangsu in eastern china and sichuan qinghai gansu and xinjiang in western china the concept drift of the src between temperature and ndvi accounted for 1 20 of china fig 19b the concept drift occurred areas are mainly in the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china jiangsu and guangdong in southeastern china and sichuan qinghai tibet and xinjiang in western china the spatial concept drift results of the src between scpdsi and ndvi is shown in fig 19c the area where concept drift occurred accounts for 0 50 it can be seen that concept drift mainly occurs in northern china yet the occurrence areas are relatively scattered fig 19d and e and f illustrate the spatial concept drift results of the src of ssm rzsm and psm to ndvi occurred in 0 68 0 58 and 0 58 of the area respectively it can be seen from the figure that the positions of concept drift are roughly similar it mainly occurs in heilongjiang of northeastern china xinjiang of northwestern china and sichuan and tibet of southwestern china the detection result of the spatial concept drift of the pca1 is shown in fig 20 occurred in 1 7 of the area the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china gansu qinghai tibet and xinjiang in western china and fujian in eastern china are the main areas where concept drift occurred the concept drift detection result integrates the features of the 7 variables so the concept drift result displayed is similar to the superimposed result of the fig 16 and fig 17 4 discussion vegetation is considered to be the most important parameter for environmental assessment and monitoring due to its special role in the cross study of hydrosphere biosphere atmosphere ayantobo and wei 2019 li et al 2020 li et al 2021 the response of vegetation to global climate change has significant regional differentiation and shows different time scales mahmoudi et al 2021 sun et al 2020 therefore the use of vegetation index to reflect global climate change has attracted more and more attention babüroğlu et al 2021 cai et al 2021 liu et al 2020 ndvi can more accurately reflect vegetation coverage growth status biomass photosynthesis intensity etc so it is the most commonly used vegetation coverage index piedallu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the growth and changes of vegetation are closely related to climate factors such as precipitation temperature humidity and sunshine wei et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 the change of climate has undoubtedly become one of the important factors affecting the change of vegetation cover huang et al 2020 pang et al 2017 the relationship between vegetation and climate change has gradually become a hot spot in scientific research today han et al 2019 nanzad et al 2019 spadoni et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 in this study ndvi was used as the dependent variable and 6 factors were selected as independent variables two indicators scc and src were used to analyze the relationship between different factors and ndvi it is worth noting that the scc indicator focuses on the correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable while the src focuses on the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable dairel and fidelis 2020 ghebrezgabher et al 2020 liu et al 2021 there are certain differences between the two previous studies focused on the correlation between ndvi and impact factors while ignoring the weight differences of impact factors on ndvi french et al 2020 gim et al 2020 wu et al 2021 in the past a single factor was often used for regional climate divisions in china such as precipitation to distinguish wet and dry regions and temperature to distinguish temperature zones ghebrezgabher et al 2020 hu et al 2008 moreno et al 2020 however the regional climate is the result of multiple factors and it is difficult for a single factor to fully reflect the regional climate type using pca to combine multiple indicators for environmental zoning can better reflect the environmental characteristics of a region han et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 liu et al 2020a the simulation and prediction of ndvi should not neglect the impact of human activities on vegetation coverage french et al 2020 gonçalves et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 for example in china s three major economic circles the beijing tianjin hebei the yangtze river delta and the pearl river delta even if the water and heat are sufficient the vegetation coverage is still low due to the high degree of hardening of the ground fig 21 since the data in this study is only in 2018 we focus on the research of spatial data flow and there is less research on time data flow in future studies we will collect ndvi data for a longer period of time to study the trend and sudden changes of ndvi in china 5 conclusions there are many factors that can affect the distribution of ndvi in space this study selected six elements to analyze the main factors affecting ndvi status in different regions of china in addition we carried out reasonable division and detection of the regional environment this study contributes to a more deep understanding of the spatial environment structure of china the main conclusions acquired from this study are as follows 1 the precipitation temperature soil water content and ndvi in china all present a distribution state of high in the south and low in the north and high in the east and low in the west generally most areas of china has the same period of rain and heat and summer is the period with the highest vegetation coverage 2 ssm and temperature are the main factors affecting ndvi in china the scc between temperature and ndvi is the largest in most areas of china in southwestern china and southern tibet the scc between ssm and ndvi is the largest while the scc between rzsm and ndvi is the largest in arid areas from the spatial distribution of src ssm is the biggest impact factor affecting ndvi in most areas of china followed by temperature while rzsm and psm are the biggest impact factors affecting ndvi in arid regions 3 through comprehensive multi factor analysis the environment of china can be roughly divided into three main regions the southern region the northern region and the northwest inland region while there is a certain transition zone between each region 4 the deep learning algorithm can simulate the spatial distribution of ndvi very well the nses during training and verification periods are 0 893 and 0 833 respectively however its ability to describe details is poor especially in areas with a high degree of urbanization where the simulated ndvi is usually higher 5 the main locations occurred concept drift in china are the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china sichuan yunnan and southern tibet in southwestern china and qinghai gansu and xinjiang in northwestern china it is worth noting that the positions of concept drift of different factors in space are roughly consistent indicating that regional environment mutation is related to multiple factors as the vegetation cover is greatly affected by the underlying surface in future research it is necessary to consider the impact of human activities on the vegetation cover and further analyze the causes of mutation in the regional environment credit authorship contribution statement haoyu jin conceptualization investigation software validation

3860,normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is an important indicator reflecting the state of regional climate and environment which is affected by precipitation temperature soil water content and so on this study analyzed the influence of different factors on ndvi through the spearman correlation coefficient scc and standard regression coefficient src carried out climate zoning in china through principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis simulated the ndvi value through deep learning algorithm and analyzed the spatial mutation positions of different factors through concept drift detection the research results show that the main factor that affects ndvi in most areas of china is surface soil moisture ssm followed by temperature while in arid areas root zone soil moisture rzsm and profile soil moisture psm are the main influencing factors the climate zones of china can be roughly divided into northern southern and northwestern inland areas while there are transitional zones between different main zones the deep learning algorithm can simulate the ndvi value very well and the nash efficiency coefficients nse during training and verification periods are 0 893 and 0 833 respectively however the details of some areas are rough this shows that the selected impact factors can basically determine the status of ndvi and these impact factors can be used to predict the changes in ndvi the environmental drift areas discovered by concept drift detection are mainly in the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china yunnan sichuan and southern tibet in southwestern china and gansu qinghai and xinjiang in northwestern china this study provides an important reference for the analysis of environmental regional zoning climate change detection and simulation keywords correlation analysis principal component analysis clustering analysis deep learning concept drift detection 1 introduction normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a commonly used vegetation index which can monitor vegetation growth status and vegetation coverage french et al 2020 ghebrezgabher et al 2020 shammi and meng 2021 since ndvi algorithm can eliminate most of the irradiance changes related to instrument calibration sun angle topography cloud shadows and atmospheric conditions and enhance the response to vegetation it is currently most widely used in more than 40 vegetation indices gim et al 2020 spadoni et al 2020 wu et al 2021 liu et al 2020b ndvi also has many applications in hydrology such as monitoring changes in drought conditions as input variables for hydrological models monitoring changes in water levels in rivers lakes reservoirs and so on garcía gamero et al 2021 grodek et al 2020 li et al 2020 generally vegetation grows densely in areas with sufficient water and heat such as tropical rain forest areas han et al 2019 moreno et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 vegetation growth is affected by many factors for example in the savanna areas of africa there is sufficient heat however due to scarce precipitation the trees are sparse campagnolo et al 2021 chapungu et al 2020 dairel and fidelis 2020 affected by human activities especially in urban areas the vegetation coverage has dropped significantly compared with the original state chu et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2019 piedallu et al 2019 the growth state of vegetation is a comprehensive response to the climate environment and can reflect its changing trend huang et al 2020 nanzad et al 2019 pang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 many studies use ndvi to analyze changes in the regional ecological environment changes in land use and the impact of human activities on the natural environment maneja et al 2020 shi et al 2021 by using trend analysis mutation analysis correlation analysis and wavelet analysis the vegetation cover change trend and its related influencing factors can be studied li et al 2021 neeti et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 in recent years models based on machine learning and artificial neural networks have also been applied to the simulation and prediction of regional ndvi changes bui et al 2020 liu et al 2020c tien bui et al 2020 yin et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the natural environment of different regions in china varies greatly hu et al 2008 sun et al 2016 zhu et al 2011 the state of vegetation coverage is affected by various conditions such as temperature precipitation topography light and human activities different regions have different factors that play a leading role in vegetation wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 this study extracted the precipitation temperature self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi surface soil moisture ssm root zone soil moisture rzsm profile soil moisture psm and ndvi data of china in 2018 through correlation analysis principal component analysis pca clustering deep learning concept drift methods the impact of different factors on ndvi was analyzed this study contributes to in depth understand the regional climate environmental status distribution and climate environmental changes of china 2 methods and data 2 1 study area china is located in the east of asia on the west coast of the pacific ocean 73 40 135 05 e 3 51 53 33 n with a land area of approximately 9 6 million km2 the terrain of china is distributed in an obvious three level ladder fig 1 the first ladder is the qinghai tibet plateau with an average elevation of more than 4000 m above sea level a s l the second ladder is between 1000 and 2000 m a s l mainly high mountain landforms and the third ladder is below 500 m a s l and the landform is dominated by plains and hills liu et al 2020 due to the large differences in the distance from the sea in different regions combined with the diverse terrain types and mountain directions thus form a diverse climate environment in china sun et al 2020 in terms of climate type the eastern part has a monsoon climate which can be divided into tropical monsoon climate subtropical monsoon climate and temperate monsoon climate the northwest has a temperate continental climate and the qinghai tibet plateau has an alpine climate cai et al 2021 from the division of temperature zones there are tropical subtropical warm temperate medium temperate cold temperate and qinghai tibet plateau regions wang et al 2017 from the perspective of the division of wet and dry regions there are humid regions semi humid regions semi arid regions and arid regions wei et al 2020 the regional environment is affected by many factors such as topography land and sea location atmospheric circulation and so on therefore even in the same climate type there also have differences in heat and wetness the complexity of the terrain also makes the climate more complex and diverse complicated landform types diverse climatic environments and the impact of human activities have resulted in significant differences in vegetation coverage in different regions of china 2 2 data the data used in this study are ndvi precipitation temperature soil moisture and drought index data of china in 2018 the ndvi data was extracted from the united states geological survey usgs land standard data product mod13c2 v006 data set and resampled https lpdaac usgs gov products mod13c2v006 the precipitation and temperature data was downloaded from china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn zhong et al 2020 the soil moisture data was obtained from the global land surface state variable data set provided by the global land data assimilation system gldas https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets the scpdsi index is improved on the basis of the palmer drought severity index pdsi which takes into account the climatic characteristics of different sites so that the persistence factor and the climate weighting factor are automatically corrected according to local characteristics ayantobo and wei 2019 the scpdsi value generally varies between 5 dry and 5 humid the scpdsi data set was provided by the east anglia climatic research unit in the united kingdom https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought because the spatial resolutions of different data sets are inconsistent the spatial resampling method was used to unify all data to a resolution of 0 5 0 5 and project them to the same coordinate system 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 spearman correlation and standardized regression coefficients spearman correlation coefficient scc is a coefficient that measures the correlation between variables based on ranked data and is a no parameter test method pastén zapata et al 2020 it uses a monotonic equation to evaluate the correlation between two statistical variables spearman s rank correlation coefficient does not require strict data conditions it only requires that the observations of the two variables are paired rating data or converted from continuous variable observations and it has no requirements on the overall distribution of data and sample size if there is a strict monotonic relationship between the two variables the spearman rank correlation coefficient is 1 or 1 at that time the two variables have completely spearman rank correlation it is worth noting that the pearson correlation coefficient can only reflect the linear relationship between the two variables so this study uses the scc in order to eliminate the influence of the data scale the zero mean normalization method is used to standardize the data the calculation formula of spearman s correlation coefficient is as follows 1 corr s i x i x y i y i x i x 2 i y i y 2 where corr s is spearman s correlation coefficient x i and y i are the average of the descending position of each original data x and y are the average values of x i and y i respectively in practical applications the link between variables is irrelevant so corr s can be calculated by the following formula 2 corr s 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where d i x i y i n is the number of variable elements the standard regression coefficient src refers to the regression coefficient after eliminating the scale influence of the dependent variable and the independent variable liu et al 2020d the absolute value of the regression coefficient directly reflects the degree of influence that the independent variable has on the dependent variable the larger the absolute value of the src the greater the degree of influence on the dependent variable and the positive or negative value represents the direction of influence on the dependent variable the calculation formula is as follows 3 y α x 1 β x 2 γ x 3 δ x 4 θ where y is the independent variable x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 are the independent variables α β γ and δ are the standardized regression coefficients corresponding to the independent variables and θ is the residual 2 3 2 pca and clustering this study includes the dependent variable ndvi and 6 independent variables a total of 7 variables on the premise of retaining the main information of the data the pca method was used to convert high dimensional data into low dimensional data mahmoudi et al 2021 and through cluster analysis the climate and environment classification status in china were revealed pca is a multivariate statistical method it is one of the most commonly used dimensionality reduction methods a set of potentially correlated variable data is transformed into a set of linearly independent variables through orthogonal transformation the variables are called principal components the calculation formula is mainly as follows 4 z 1 z 2 z 3 z k x 1 x 2 x 3 x d y 11 y 12 y 13 y 1 d y 21 y 22 y 23 y 2 d y 31 y 32 y 33 y 3 d y k 1 y k 2 y k 3 y kd where z is the k dimensional principal component x is the d dimensional original data and y is the d k dimensional conversion matrix generally k d clustering algorithm is a typical unsupervised learning algorithm which is mainly used to automatically classify similar samples into a category liu et al 2020 in the clustering algorithm the samples are divided into different categories according to the similarity between the samples the commonly used similarity calculation method is the euclidean distance method commonly used clustering algorithms are k means clustering hierarchical clustering density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan because k means clustering principle is simple easy to implement and the classification effect is better so it is more widely used li et al 2021 liu et al 2020 the main calculation step is to determine the optimal classification category through the elbow algorithm and then randomly select the initial point as the centroid and by calculating the similarity between each sample and the centroid the sample points are classified into the most similar class by recalculating the centroid of each class this process is repeated until the centroid no longer changes and finally the class to which each sample belongs and the centroid of each class are determined 2 3 3 deep learning algorithm deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on artificial neural networks dixit and silakari 2021 different from traditional machine learning deep learning requires more samples in exchange for fewer manual annotations and higher accuracy deep learning uses depth to replace breadth further reduces parameters and improves fitting capabilities in many cases it performs better than traditional machine learning the basic models in deep learning are roughly divided into three categories multilayer perceptron models deep neural network models and recurrent neural network models huang et al 2020 its representatives are deep belief network dbn convolution neural network cnn and recurrent neural network rnn fig 2 illustrates the structure diagram of a typical deep learning neural network which is composed of an input layer an output layer and multiple hidden layers each hidden layer contains multiple neurons to process the data the complex network layer can simulate almost any kind of function changes the main task of deep learning is to classify and predict data 2 3 4 concept drift detection concept drift refers to the unpredictable changes in the potential data distribution in the data stream over time which makes the original classifiers inaccurate or the decision making system unable to make correct decisions babüroğlu et al 2021 concept drift can be divided into virtual concept drift and real concept drift when the real concept drift occurs it indicates that the original model can no longer accurately simulate and predict the current data in concept drift detection algorithms classification accuracy is usually used as a criterion for judging whether concept drift occurs bui et al 2020 wei et al 2020 in the regression problem the concept drift is detected by the mean square error index of the predicted value and the true value in classification or regression problems there may be abnormal prediction values however a small amount of outliers does not represent the occurrence of concept drift so the measurement of concept drift through learning accuracy must be robust enough and not too sensitive page hinckley test is an error detection algorithm based on the cumulative error rate which can detect whether the data fluctuates and at the same time a small amount of outliers will not affect the error detection similar to the time data stream spatial data can be extracted as a spatial data stream according to the spatial coordinate position fig 3 illustrates the concept drift detection process of the spatial data stream marking the points in the space where the concept drift occurs the spatial distribution of the concept drift region can be depicted through concept drift monitoring the location of sudden changes in regional climate and environment can be found 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal distribution pattern of the variables the spatio temporal distribution of monthly precipitation in china in 2018 is shown in fig 4 a the precipitation is mainly concentrated from may to august and the southern part has more precipitation than the northern part and the entire northwestern inland area has sparse precipitation throughout the year fig 4b shows the spatio temporal distribution of monthly average temperature in china in 2018 the distribution of temperature is similar to that of precipitation the temperature in the south is high and lasts for a long time while the temperature in the north is low and the duration of high temperature weather is short the northeast and northwest regions are extremely cold in winter with temperatures as low as 30 c in some areas from the spatio temporal distribution of monthly scpdsi in china in 2018 fig 4c it shows the southern and northwestern regions are wetter than before while the northern regions are even drier than before except for liaoning which is more arid than before other parts of northeast china are wetter than before fig 4d and e and f depict the spatio temporal distribution of ssm rzsm and psm in china in 2018 respectively overall the soil moisture in the south is high followed by the songhua river basin in the northeast the soil in northwest and inner mongolia is relatively dry while the tarim basin is the driest area from the spatio temporal distribution characteristics of monthly average ndvi in china in 2018 fig 5 it shows that the vegetation coverage in the southern region is the highest followed by the northern and northeastern regions and the inland northwestern region has a low vegetation coverage the vegetation coverage is high in summer and low in spring autumn and winter on the whole the vegetation coverage in china shows a similar pattern to the distribution of water and heat the southern region has sufficient rain and heat making high vegetation coverage while north and northeast china have reduced water and heat making low vegetation coverage the inland areas of northwestern china have sparse rainfall and a harsh climate which restricts the growth of vegetation the qinghai tibet plateau has a severe cold climate and is not suitable for plant growth 3 2 spatial correlation analysis 3 2 1 scc distribution analysis fig 6 a shows that the scc between ndvi and precipitation are positively correlated in most areas of china however the correlation between precipitation and ndvi is not very high in some parts of the south which may be related to the fact that these areas are agricultural areas and the water needed by crops can be supplemented by irrigation ndvi is positively correlated with temperature in most areas of china fig 6b however ndvi is negatively correlated with temperature in some parts of the northwest china this may be due to excessive temperature will accelerate the loss of water in the northwestern inland areas where precipitation is scarce which is not conducive to plant growth fig 6c shows that ndvi and scpdsi are negatively correlated in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and most area of xinjiang while ndvi and scpdsi are strongly positively correlated in the north china plain and southwest china fig 6d and e and f illustrate the spatial distribution characteristics of the sccs of ssm rzsm psm with ndvi respectively on the whole soil water content at different depths has roughly the same effect on vegetation in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river most areas of xinjiang and some areas of the northeast china ndvi is negatively correlated with soil moisture while ndvi is positively correlated with soil moisture in southwest china north china and tibet this indicates that excessive soil water in some areas is not conducive to the growth of vegetation from fig 7 a it can been seen that the selected variables have a strong correlation effect on ndvi corrs 0 75 while in southeastern xinjiang and a small part of southern china the scc that has the greatest influence on ndvi is negative the spatial distribution of the factors corresponding to the largest scc is shown in fig 7b it can be seen that the temperature has the strongest correlation with ndvi in most areas of china meanwhile in yunnan southern tibet guangdong guangxi and hainan coastal areas ssm has the strongest correlation with ndvi the correlations of scpdsi and rzsm with ndvi are the strongest in the inland areas of northwest china this shows that in areas with abundant precipitation temperature has the greatest impact on ndvi and areas with abundant sunlight ssm have the greatest impact on ndvi in areas with arid climate drought and deep groundwater content have the greatest impact on ndvi 3 2 2 src distribution analysis from the src of precipitation to ndvi fig 8 a it shows precipitation in tibet and northeast china has a large impact on ndvi while precipitation in some parts of xinjiang has a large negative impact on ndvi the temperature in southeastern china has a large impact on ndvi while the temperature in parts of northwest china has a large negative impact on ndvi fig 8b the influence of temperature in other regions on ndvi is relatively weak fig 8c shows that the scpdsi in the inland areas of northwest china has a large and negative impact on ndvi it indicates that the drought in the inland areas of northwest china will seriously reduce the vegetation coverage fig 8d and e and f illustrate the spatial distribution of the src of ssm rzsm and psm to ndvi respectively it can be seen from the figure that ndvi is greatly affected by soil water content in xinjiang and part of southwest china while the impact on other regions is relatively weak it shows that the spatial distribution of the effect of soil water on ndvi is relatively consistent and most of them are positive feedback effects the spatial distribution of the maximum absolute value src of these factors to ndvi is shown in fig 9 a it can be seen from the figure that the src of the lop nur area in xinjiang and part of southwestern china are abnormally large while the src of other regions are relatively stable from the id spatial distribution of the maximum absolute value src of the variables to ndvi fig 9b the temperature has the greatest impact on ndvi in eastern china and northern xinjiang ssm has the largest impact on ndvi in southwest china and northwest china and precipitation has the largest impact on ndvi in northern tibet while in shaanxi and western inner mongolia rzsm and psm have a greater impact on ndvi this shows the factors that restrict plant growth are different in different regions for the healthy growth of plants the southern regions need to focus on the impact of temperature the northern regions need to focus on the impact of precipitation and the dry regions need to focus on the impact of soil moisture 3 3 clustering based on principal component analysis reducing the dimensions of 7 factors including ndvi into one principal component dimension through principal component analysis can reflect more comprehensively the spatial distribution characteristics of multi factor integration from the distribution of the first principal component pca1 in space fig 10 the regional climate environment of china can divide into three major regions the southeast region the north and northeast regions and the northwest region from the perspective of basic climate and environment distribution these three sub regions basically represent regional climate and environment distribution in china the southeast region is rich in rain and heat and the climate is mild the precipitation and sunlight in north china and northeast china have been reduced the northwest inland areas have sparse precipitation and harsh climate conditions fig 11 shows the result by using elbow method to find the optimal number of classifications when the number of classifications is 6 the intra cluster error has become very small and as the number of classifications increases the intra cluster error will not decrease significantly so 6 is selected as the optimal number of classifications the spatial clustering results of the first principal component fig 12 are basically consistent with the spatial variable distribution shown in fig 10 the basic partition is divided into three major categories and there is a transition zone between the basic partitions southeastern china is grouped into one category though the coastal areas have a few variations north china northeast china and southwest china are grouped into one category and the northwestern china inland areas are grouped into one category it is worth noting that the taklimakan desert and the mu us desert are grouped into one category and the liaodong peninsula is also grouped into this category which shows that the climate and environment of the liaodong peninsula have significantly increased aridity the silhouette analysis method is used to quantitatively analyze the clustering quality fig 13 is the silhouette analysis evaluation result of the clustering result it shows the clustering results are good and the average value of the silhouette coefficient is 0 573 among them the classification results of the second and sixth categories are the best and the fifth category has a small number of negative points indicating that some areas are incorrectly classified into the fifth category 3 4 ndvi simulation based on deep learning in order to show that the selected influencing factors can basically determine the change of ndvi a deep learning algorithm was used to calculate ndvi through these influencing factors 70 of the data was randomly selected from the spatial data stream as the training data 30 of the rest data was used as validation data the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r2 and spearman rank correlation coefficient srcc during the training period are 0 073 0 053 and 0 893 0 923 0 945 respectively fig 14 a and b this shows the simulation effect during the training period is very good the rmse mae nse r2 and srcc in the validation period are 0 085 0 063 0 833 0 90 0 913 respectively fig 14c and d this shows the model simulation effect in the validation period is still very good but slightly worse than the training period from the spatial distribution of the relative error between the simulated ndvi based on deep learning and the actual ndvi fig 15 a the simulated ndvi value in coastal areas is higher than the actual value while the simulated ndvi value in northeast china northwest xinjiang and southwest china is lower than the actual value the simulated ndvi has a significant linear relationship with the actual ndvi and the decisive coefficient is as high as 0 91 fig 15b this shows that the method based on deep learning can simulate the ndvi value very well and provides an effective method for simulating and predicting the change of the ndvi value fig 15c and d show the spatial distribution diagrams of actual ndvi and simulated ndvi respectively the simulated ndvi is basically the same as the actual ndvi distribution southern china has high vegetation coverage north china and northeast china have reduced vegetation coverage and northwestern china inland areas have the lowest vegetation coverage from the perspective of detailed description the simulated ndvi is not accurate enough in some areas for example in northwestern xinjiang northeast china the simulated value is low while the simulated value in the southeast china coastal area is high without considering the impact of urbanization on vegetation coverage 3 5 concept drift detection through the spatial concept drift detection 2 09 of the area has a sudden change in precipitation fig 16 a it can be seen that northeast china southwest china and qinghai tibet are the areas with the most significant precipitation changes fig 16b illustrates the conceptual drift of temperature in space occurred in 4 05 of the area the heilongjiang river basin in northeast china yunnan province in southwest china qinghai and tibet anhui and jiangsu in the eastern china are the main areas where temperature changes have occurred the concept drift of scpdsi in china accounts for 0 97 fig 16c it can be seen from the figure that the concept drift areas of scpdsi are relative less than other factors and mainly occur in liaoning shaanxi and yunnan provinces fig 16d and e f depict the spatial concept drift detection results of ssm rzsm and psm occurred in 1 91 1 65 and 1 75 of the area respectively it can be seen from the figure that the conceptual drift regions of ssm rzsm and psm are roughly the same it mainly occurs in the heilongjiang river basin in northeast china southeast china qinghai tibet and xinjiang the spatial concept drift detection result of ndvi is shown in fig 17 occurred in 2 82 of the area it can be seen from the figure that the main areas where the concept drift of ndvi occurs are the heilongjiang river basin in northeast china anhui and jiangsu in eastern china and qinghai and tibet in western china the spatial concept drift detection result of the scc between precipitation and ndvi is shown in fig 18 a occurred in 1 96 of the area it can be seen that the upper reaches of heilongjiang river basin in northeast china the liaodong peninsula zhejiang in east china and xinjiang in northwest china are the main areas where concept drift occurs the scc between temperature and ndvi has a concept drift of 1 86 of the area fig 18b the lower reaches of the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china the liaodong peninsula zhejiang and fujian in eastern china and xinjiang and tibet in northwestern china are the main areas of conceptual drift fig 18c e and f illustrate the spatial concept drift detection results of the sccs of scpdsi ssm rzsm psm with ndvi respectively it can be seen from the figure that the spearman correlation coefficients between these factors and ndvi have no concept drift the spatial concept drift result of the src of precipitation to ndvi is shown in fig 19 a concept drift occurred in 1 36 of china it can be seen that concept drift mainly occurs in the upper reaches of the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china jiangsu in eastern china and sichuan qinghai gansu and xinjiang in western china the concept drift of the src between temperature and ndvi accounted for 1 20 of china fig 19b the concept drift occurred areas are mainly in the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china jiangsu and guangdong in southeastern china and sichuan qinghai tibet and xinjiang in western china the spatial concept drift results of the src between scpdsi and ndvi is shown in fig 19c the area where concept drift occurred accounts for 0 50 it can be seen that concept drift mainly occurs in northern china yet the occurrence areas are relatively scattered fig 19d and e and f illustrate the spatial concept drift results of the src of ssm rzsm and psm to ndvi occurred in 0 68 0 58 and 0 58 of the area respectively it can be seen from the figure that the positions of concept drift are roughly similar it mainly occurs in heilongjiang of northeastern china xinjiang of northwestern china and sichuan and tibet of southwestern china the detection result of the spatial concept drift of the pca1 is shown in fig 20 occurred in 1 7 of the area the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china gansu qinghai tibet and xinjiang in western china and fujian in eastern china are the main areas where concept drift occurred the concept drift detection result integrates the features of the 7 variables so the concept drift result displayed is similar to the superimposed result of the fig 16 and fig 17 4 discussion vegetation is considered to be the most important parameter for environmental assessment and monitoring due to its special role in the cross study of hydrosphere biosphere atmosphere ayantobo and wei 2019 li et al 2020 li et al 2021 the response of vegetation to global climate change has significant regional differentiation and shows different time scales mahmoudi et al 2021 sun et al 2020 therefore the use of vegetation index to reflect global climate change has attracted more and more attention babüroğlu et al 2021 cai et al 2021 liu et al 2020 ndvi can more accurately reflect vegetation coverage growth status biomass photosynthesis intensity etc so it is the most commonly used vegetation coverage index piedallu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the growth and changes of vegetation are closely related to climate factors such as precipitation temperature humidity and sunshine wei et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 the change of climate has undoubtedly become one of the important factors affecting the change of vegetation cover huang et al 2020 pang et al 2017 the relationship between vegetation and climate change has gradually become a hot spot in scientific research today han et al 2019 nanzad et al 2019 spadoni et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 in this study ndvi was used as the dependent variable and 6 factors were selected as independent variables two indicators scc and src were used to analyze the relationship between different factors and ndvi it is worth noting that the scc indicator focuses on the correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable while the src focuses on the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable dairel and fidelis 2020 ghebrezgabher et al 2020 liu et al 2021 there are certain differences between the two previous studies focused on the correlation between ndvi and impact factors while ignoring the weight differences of impact factors on ndvi french et al 2020 gim et al 2020 wu et al 2021 in the past a single factor was often used for regional climate divisions in china such as precipitation to distinguish wet and dry regions and temperature to distinguish temperature zones ghebrezgabher et al 2020 hu et al 2008 moreno et al 2020 however the regional climate is the result of multiple factors and it is difficult for a single factor to fully reflect the regional climate type using pca to combine multiple indicators for environmental zoning can better reflect the environmental characteristics of a region han et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 liu et al 2020a the simulation and prediction of ndvi should not neglect the impact of human activities on vegetation coverage french et al 2020 gonçalves et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 for example in china s three major economic circles the beijing tianjin hebei the yangtze river delta and the pearl river delta even if the water and heat are sufficient the vegetation coverage is still low due to the high degree of hardening of the ground fig 21 since the data in this study is only in 2018 we focus on the research of spatial data flow and there is less research on time data flow in future studies we will collect ndvi data for a longer period of time to study the trend and sudden changes of ndvi in china 5 conclusions there are many factors that can affect the distribution of ndvi in space this study selected six elements to analyze the main factors affecting ndvi status in different regions of china in addition we carried out reasonable division and detection of the regional environment this study contributes to a more deep understanding of the spatial environment structure of china the main conclusions acquired from this study are as follows 1 the precipitation temperature soil water content and ndvi in china all present a distribution state of high in the south and low in the north and high in the east and low in the west generally most areas of china has the same period of rain and heat and summer is the period with the highest vegetation coverage 2 ssm and temperature are the main factors affecting ndvi in china the scc between temperature and ndvi is the largest in most areas of china in southwestern china and southern tibet the scc between ssm and ndvi is the largest while the scc between rzsm and ndvi is the largest in arid areas from the spatial distribution of src ssm is the biggest impact factor affecting ndvi in most areas of china followed by temperature while rzsm and psm are the biggest impact factors affecting ndvi in arid regions 3 through comprehensive multi factor analysis the environment of china can be roughly divided into three main regions the southern region the northern region and the northwest inland region while there is a certain transition zone between each region 4 the deep learning algorithm can simulate the spatial distribution of ndvi very well the nses during training and verification periods are 0 893 and 0 833 respectively however its ability to describe details is poor especially in areas with a high degree of urbanization where the simulated ndvi is usually higher 5 the main locations occurred concept drift in china are the heilongjiang river basin in northeastern china sichuan yunnan and southern tibet in southwestern china and qinghai gansu and xinjiang in northwestern china it is worth noting that the positions of concept drift of different factors in space are roughly consistent indicating that regional environment mutation is related to multiple factors as the vegetation cover is greatly affected by the underlying surface in future research it is necessary to consider the impact of human activities on the vegetation cover and further analyze the causes of mutation in the regional environment credit authorship contribution statement haoyu jin conceptualization investigation software validation

such investigations in order to reveal temporal dependence of cnr this study develop a novel statistical framework in the framework we employ quantile regression to generate overall the entire dataset annual subsets for each year and accumulative subsets collected before a certain year cnrs we aim to 1 show biases of annual relationships by comparing the overall and annual relationships and 2 determine whether or not data accumulation is enough to develop a reliable cnr we use lake champlain and lake kasumigaura as case studies to illustrate the necessary steps needed to utilize this novel framework results show that large interannual variations exist for cnrs accumulative relationships tend to converge to the overall relationship indicating that overall relationships are reliable for informing lake specific eutrophication management in the two case study lakes the novel statistical framework that we propose for a procedure to estimate reliable cnrs is important for informing lake specific eutrophication control decision making processes keywords statistical framework quantile regression nutrient limitation temporal dependence eutrophication management 1 introduction globally anthropogenic nutrient loading from industrial and agricultural development has deteriorated water quality and impaired ecosystem structure and function in many lakes chislock and doster 2013 ho et al 2019 huang et al 2019 le moal et al 2019 smith and schindler 2009 in most cases nutrients including phosphorus and nitrogen are treated as two of the most manageable factors to curb lake eutrophication carvalho et al 2013 conley et al 2009 schindler et al 2008 therefore quantitative relationships between chlorophyll chl and nutrients are fundamental to guide lake eutrophication management filstrup et al 2014 huo et al 2013 huo et al 2018 jones et al 2011 liang et al 2021b vinçon leite and casenave 2019 the chl nutrient relationship cnr often varies substantially among lakes the variations of cnrs across spatial scales complicate lake eutrophication management brown et al 2000 chen and li 2014 phillips et al 2008 for example a one size fits all approach where a single cnr is used to manage eutrophication across a diverse set of lakes is often not possible this spatial variability in cnrs has been well established cha et al 2016 qian et al 2019 zou et al 2020 and other studies have explored drivers of these spatially varying relationships at multiple scales abell et al 2012 filstrup et al 2014 such studies have found that regional factors such as land use and land cover can explain some of the spatial variation observed in cnrs huo et al 2014 rohm et al 2002 wagner et al 2011 in addition recent research has shown that factors operating at the lake scale such as lake depth and watershed scale e g surrounding land use can also influence cnrs qin et al 2020 read et al 2015 considering the spatial heterogeneity of lake specific drivers of cnrs lake specific eutrophication management strategies xu et al 2015a such as the development of lakes specific nutrient criteria liang et al 2020 olson and hawkins 2013 has been recommended at the lake scale a reliable cnr is critical for informing successful management strategies however a lake specific cnr might vary over time liang et al 2019 understanding potential temporal variations in cnrs could also be important for determining a reliable i e tempotally stable lake specific cnr despite some recent progress on developing lake specific cnrs liang et al 2020 qian et al 2019 we note that the temporal dependence of cnr has rarely been discussed or evaluated specifically several questions exist including 1 to what extent do cnrs vary annually and 2 if they do how to determine whether or not a developed cnr is reliable enough to inform lake eutrophication management particularly there lacks a statistical framework for revealing the temporal dependence of cnrs to answer the aforementioned questions quantile regression qr as an alternative to traditional ordinary least squares regression olsr has been introduced to quantify cause effect relationships between ecological variables qr is used to explore the effect of one predictor on different quantiles of a response variable cade and noon 2003 das et al 2019 rather than the average of the response variable as in mean regression methods e g olsr altman and krzywinski 2015 the major advantage of applying qr to develop cnrs is that qr can estimate the upper boundary of chl response to the nutrient chen and li 2014 heiskary and bouchard 2015 koenker and bassett 1978 compared to olsr derived models which fail to address the effect of unmeasured factors qr derived models can reflect the limiting effect of a nutrient on chl by modeling the upper distribution of the chl response to the nutrient cade et al 1999 xu et al 2015a therefore any unmeasured factors effecting cnrs including non algal suspended solids landscape factors grazing by zooplankton and other factors are considered in the qr analysis mazumder 1994 wagner et al 2011 qr has been recently expanded in cnr estimations for lake specific eutrophication assessment xu et al 2015b regional eutrophication management zou et al 2020 and global nutrient limitation quantifications abell et al 2012 however there still lacks qr applications in revealing the temporal dependence of cnrs in this study we propose a novel statistical framework to reveal lake specific temporal dependence of cnrs with the application of qr in the framework we develop overall the entire dataset annual subsets for each year and accumulative subsets collected before a certain year cnrs we attempt to 1 quantify any potential biases in annual relationships by comparing the overall and annual cnrs and 2 determine whether or not data accumulation is appropriate for developing a reliable cnr by comparing the overall and accumulative relationships we use data from lake champlain lc located in the united states and lake kasumigaura lk located in japan as case studies to illustrate steps necessary to utilize this novel framework we further discuss how our statistical framework could inform lake specific eutrophication management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we chose lc and lk as case studies based on two considerations namely the availability of long term monitoring data and lake specific physical characteristics physical characteristics measures of climate and nutrient and chl conditions for these two lakes are summarized in table 1 lc is located in the northeastern united states it is a deep lake with an average depth of 20 m and with a surface area of 1127 km2 the lake is well known for its large watershed area to lake area ratio 19 1 isles et al 2017 lk is located in ibaraki prefecture approximately 50 km northeast of tokyo japan it is the second largest shallow lake in japan with an average depth of 4 0 m the lake has a surface area of 171 km2 the watershed to lake area ratio is approximately 9 1 arai and fukushima 2014 tsuchiya et al 2019 in this study we included total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in our analysis because they are the primary limiting nutrients of lake phytoplankton phillips et al 2008 stow and cha 2013 the concentrations of tn tp and chl for estimating cnrs were obtained from the long term monitoring datasets for lc and lk the monitoring data for lc are freely available at https dec vermont gov watershed lakes ponds lake champlain a total of 4413 paired tn tp and chl concentrations for 12 sampling stations in lc from 1992 to 2018 were used in this study the lk database was obtained from the national institute for environmental studies 2016 and accessed via https db cger nies go jp gem moni e inter gems database kasumi index html 01 01 2020 monthly time series of 10 long term sampling stations spanning the years 1985 2016 were used and resulted in 3807 paired chl tn and tp values for lk all biweekly and monthly monitoring of tn tp and chl concentrations were directly applied to develop cnrs in lc average tn tp and chl concentrations were 403 3 mg m 3 24 2 mg m 3 and 6 3 mg m 3 respectively table 1 spatial variation of trophic status was observed in lc with some areas being eutrophic xu et al 2015b in contrast lk is hypereutrophic largely due to the extremely high loads of organic matter and nutrients ishii et al 2009 masunaga and komuro 2020 the average tn tp and chl concentrations were 1511 2 mg m 3 115 8 mg m 3 and 61 6 mg m 3 respectively table 1 in addition concentration ranges for tn tp and chl concentrations spanned a wider range in lk than those in lc 2 2 framework to reveal the temporal dependence of cnrs the proposed novel statistical framework to quantify potential temporal dependence of cnrs is shown in fig 1 the framework includes three steps to estimate the overall annual and accumulative cnrs both chl tn and chl tp relationships were developed because both nutrients might influence chl concentrations within lakes conley et al 2009 in the framework we want to explore two potential temporal dependencies that may exist on the one hand we compare the overall and annual relationships to show if there exist biases in annual relationships on the other hand we compare the overall and accumulative relationships to determine whether data accumulation is sufficient to develop a reliable cnr in the proposed framework the major difference among the three steps is the data used to develop the cnr the first step is to develop the overall cnr using all available data fig 1a next we develop annual cnrs based on the data collected in every year fig 1b in the third step we develop accumulative cnrs using the data collected before a specified year for example for the accumulative cnr for the year of 2010 we use all data collected before and including 2010 fig 1c following these steps we can determine if cnrs for the initial year are identical in step 2 and step 3 the cnr for the last year in the third step is the same as the overall cnr in the first step to explore the variation of annual cnrs we compare the overall relationship with annual relationships here the overall relationship could be treated as the baseline if annual relationships all concentrate near the overall relationship with small biases we could determine that even an annual cnr is reliable to inform lake specific eutrophication management if the annual relationships deviate from the overall mean relationship substantially it is worth exploring whether or not the overall relationship is reliable enough if there is large variation among annual cnrs we can then compare the overall relationship with accumulative relationships to determine the reliability of the overall relationship as aforementioned the accumulative cnr for the last year is the same as the overall relationship however if the accumulative relationships are very similar to the overall relationship several years before the last year bias less than 10 we could conclude that the cnr is relatively stable over time therefore the overall relationship may be reliable enough to inform lake eutrophication management otherwise if the bias between the accumulative relationship and the overall relationship remains large until the year just before the last year the overall relationship might not be adequate and more monitoring data may be required 2 3 qr for cnr development in the framework we apply qr to develop cnrs in all three steps the main function of qr is expressed as eq 1 koenker and bassett 1978 1 y i b 0 b 1 x i ε i where i represents the order of observations i 1 2 m m is the sample size y represents the log transformed chl concentration logchl and x represents the log transformed nutrient concentration logtp or logtn b 0 and b 1 represent the regression intercept and slope since all the data are log transformed the regression slope b 1 is interpreted as the percent change in chl concentration per 1 change in tn and tp concentration qian 2017 ε is the error the parameter estimation in linear qr is based on the minimum of absolute error eq 2 koenker and bassett 1978 2 min i i y i b 0 b 1 x i τ y i b 0 b 1 x i i i y i b 0 b 1 x i 1 τ y i b 0 b 1 x i where τ represents the quantile of the response in our study τ is chosen to be 0 9 following common practices when quantifying the limiting effect in ecological studies chassot et al 2010 coefficients of determination r 1 for 0 9 quantile were calculated to infer the goodness of fit to the upper boundary of data distributions for cnrs the r 1 value is calculated as follows r 1 1 sum f sum r where sum f refers to the sum of weighted absolute deviations minimized to estimate each of the full parameter models and sum r refers to the sum of weighted absolute deviations minimized to estimate each of corresponding reduced parameter models of logchl b 0 ε koenker and machado 1999 in order to be comparable to the olsr derived r 2 the qr derived r 1 for 0 9 quantile were converted to r 2 which are calculated as follows r 2 1 1 r 1 2 mckean and sievers 1987 schooley and wiens 2005 xu et al 2015a all models were fitted using the r software r version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 the algorithm for parameter estimation of qr models was implemented in the quantreg package koenker 2020 the code for the development of overall annual and accumulative cnrs is freely available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4087838 3 results 3 1 overall and annual cnr overall cnrs based on all available data are shown in fig 2 the overall cnr describes the upper response of chl to each nutrient in lc the qr estimated regression slopes of tn and tp are 1 33 and 0 87 respectively indicating that a 1 increase decrease for tn and tp concentration would lead to a 1 33 and 0 87 increase decrease of chl concentration in lk the qr estimated regression slopes of tn and tp are 0 85 and 0 86 respectively indicating that a 1 increase decrease of tn and tp concentration would lead to a 0 85 and 0 86 increase decrease of chl concentration it is worth noting that the overall cnrs derived from the qr method fit better than those derived from the olsr method with higher r 2 values for qr than for olsr fig 2 generally there were no apparent patterns in the annual variation for the annual cnrs in both lakes regression parameters show large interannual variation figs 3 and 4 parameter estimation results of annual cnrs in lc are shown in fig 3 hollow triangles for the chl tn relationship regression slopes range from 0 56 to 2 05 with an average of 1 35 0 41 standard deviation regression intercepts range from 4 21 to 0 50 with an average of 2 46 1 01 for the chl tp relationship average regression slopes and intercepts were 0 87 0 25 and 0 16 0 34 respectively corresponding ranges were from 0 34 to 1 54 and from 0 90 to 0 51 parameter estimation results of annual cnrs in lk are shown in fig 4 hollow triangles for the chl tn relationship regression slopes range from 0 05 to 1 36 with an average of 0 79 0 31 regression intercepts range from 2 24 to 2 03 with an average of 0 50 0 92 for the chl tp relationship average regression slopes and intercepts were 0 96 0 29 and 0 002 0 57 respectively corresponding ranges were from 0 25 to 1 56 and from 1 22 to 1 38 despite of relatively larger ranges of tn tp and chl concentrations in lk compared with lc estimated regressions parameters for these two lakes did not show many differences 3 2 accumulative cnrs parameter estimation results for the accumulative cnrs are shown in figs 3 and 4 solid dots unlike the annual cnrs regression parameters of accumulative cnrs show an obvious trend with year and generally converge to stable values i e the parameters values of overall relationships over time in lc regression slopes for the chl tn and chl tp relationships both increase with increasing year while regressions intercepts both have decreasing trends fig 3 solid dots the regression slope for the chl tn relationship increases from 0 56 to 1 22 in 1995 and then become very similar to the 1 33 slope estimated for the overall relationship regression intercepts decrease from 0 58 to 2 23 for 1995 and then converge to be very close to the overall relationship for the chl tp relationship the slope increases from 0 49 to 0 80 for the year 2004 and then become very close to the 0 87 slope estimated for overall relationship the intercept decreases from 0 36 to 0 05 for the year 2004 and then becomes very close to the overall relationship in lk patterns reverse both regression slopes decrease and both intercepts increase over time fig 4 solid dots the regression slope for the chl tn relationship increases from 1 02 to 1 18 then decreases to 0 86 in the year 1993 and generally converges to the slope of overall relationships regression intercept decreases from 1 16 to 1 61 and then increases to 0 68 in the year 1993 and converges to the overall relationships for the chl tp relationship the slope increases from 1 01 to 1 22 and then decrease to 0 93 in the year 2001 and generally converges to the slope of overall relationships regression intercept decreases from 0 08 to 0 31 then increases to 0 10 in the year 2001 and tends to the overall relationships 4 discussion 4 1 the difference of nutrient limitations between two lakes difference in the upper boundary equations on the cnrs for lc and lk indicates that the nutrients limitation of chlorophyll varies between these two case study lakes nnutrients limitation variation may be due to the difference in hydrodynamic disturbance of these lakes conjecturally the geographic location and water depth of the two lakes are the main reason for different hydrodynamic conditions lc is relatively stable in terms of hydrodynamic conditions due to its deep depth table 1 in contrast the shallow lk is influenced by the mixing effect of storms especially typhoons the energy of these storms leads to the suspension of sediments and an increase the non algal turbidity thus enhancing light limitation of phytoplankton brezonik et al 2019 jones and knowlton 2005 zhang et al 2017 therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the hydrodynamic disturbance is the primary factor influencing the nutrient limitation by the result of lower slopes for chl nutrients upper boundary equations for lk compared to lc fig 2 the differences in nutrients limitation of chlorophyll between lakes indicate that lake specific nutrient criteria are not universally applicable and the lake specific upper boundary equation of chl nutrient should be calculated using a lake specific dataset in this study the qr derived chl nutrient upper boundaries reflecting peak algal biomass response to nutrients under an ideal condition fit better than olsr derived models which cannot account for unmeasured drivers for chl fig 2 therefore it is reasonable to assume that qr provides more insight into the ecological concept of law of the minimum which could help lake managers to better understand and establish more accurate nutrient criteria here we introduce a chl standard of 15 0 mg m 3 applied by usepa 2000 as an example to show that the calculation of nutrient thresholds by the upper boundary cnr is different between the two case study lakes it appears that nutrient criteria derived from the overall chl nutrient equations are significantly different between these two case lakes given the target chl concentration of 15 0 mg m 3 the thresholds of tn and tp for lc are 458 8 mg m 3 logtn 2 66 and 32 9 mg m 3 logtp 1 52 respectively the thresholds for tn and tp for lk are 146 1 mg m 3 logtn 2 16 and 13 4 mg m 3 logtp 1 13 respectively this suggests that lake specific nutrient criteria developed using upper boundary qr equations will be useful for informing lake eutrophication management 4 2 variation of annual cnr there was large variations in regressions parameters among annual cnrs in both lakes figs 3 and 4 more importantly regression parameters in some years differed substantially from regression parameters of the overall relationship for example in lc for the chl tn relationship in 1992 the regression slope was estimated to 0 56 and the difference from the overall value is 1 36 times the slope of 1992 in lk for the chl tp relationship in 2010 the regression intercept was estimated at 0 88 and the difference from the overall value of 0 21 was 1 24 times the intercept of 2010 because the cnr is determined by the regression slope and intercept together we further explored the deviation of annual cnrs with the overall relationship fig 5 we found that annual relationships vary substantially among years and are different from the overall relationships in fact the biases between some annual relationships and the overall relationship were very large for example for the chl tn relationship in lc the regression equation in 1999 was logchl 2 05 0 27 logtn 4 21 0 69 which was different from the overall regression equation logchl 1 33 0 09 logtn 2 36 0 22 assuming that the tn is 1000 mg m 3 the chl derived from the 1999 regression equation is 87 1 mg m 3 and that from overall equation is 42 7 mg m 3 additionally assuming that the tp is 100 mg m 3 the chl calculated from the regression equation in 1986 is 123 0 mg m 3 which is 1 45 times that of overall global climate change and regional watershed nutrient dynamics may result in annual variation of chl nutrient upper boundary equations generally erratic fluctuation in nutrient limitation on chl is attributed to annually differences in temperature which is vital for phytoplankton growth huisman et al 2018 huo et al 2019 paterson et al 2017 additionally differences in annual precipitation is expected to influence concentrations of non algal suspended solids by watershed inputs which contributes to variations in the slopes of chl nutrient upper boundary equations jones and knowlton 2005 yuan and jones 2020 as the different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus are transported from the watershed to the lake variable precipitation intensity alters the input n p which further affects the utilization of nutrients by phytoplankton in lakes isles et al 2017 considering the large biases between the overall relationship and annual relationships in some years for both lakes and both nutrients we conclude that the annual cnr do in fact vary short term monitoring might not be able to reflect the overall ecological process influencing nutrient phytoplankton dynamics over longer temporal scales smol 2019 despite annual relationships in some years being close to the overall relationship applying a cnr developed using data from a single year might mislead lake eutrophication management decisions to develop a reliable lake specific cnr more data collected over more years rather than more data collected in a single year are likely required 4 3 stabilization of cnr with data accumulation after determining that data from a single year might not be adequate to develop a reliable cnr and that additional data collected over more years is desirable the next question is how to determine whether or not the accumulated data are sufficient to adequately characterize the lake s true cnr in our framework we answer this question by comparing the overall relationship with accumulative relationships we consider the cnr stable when the difference between coefficients for a certain dataset and the overall relationship is 10 or less as we mentioned before parameters of accumulative cnrs generally converge to parameters of the overall relationships we visually identified the year at which parameters of accumulative relationship and overall relationships become similar converge in lc for the tn chl and tp chl relationship the year is approximate 1995 and 2012 respectively in lk for the tn chl and tp chl relationship the year is approximate 1990 and 2001 respectively moreover accumulative relationships tend to converge to the overall cnrs as more years are sampled fig 6 for example for the chl tn relationship in lc the accumulative relationship for the initial year differs from the overall chl tn relationship as more years are included in the calculation of the relationship the accumulative relationship becomes closer to the overall relationship finally accumulative relationships for years near the last year are almost coincident with the overall relationship with variation between the two less than 10 the chl tp relationships in lc and those in lk have similar patterns the convergent trend of accumulative cnr to the corresponding overall relationship indicates that the overall relationship is reliable to inform lake eutrophication since it becomes relatively stable after several years from the initial year in our cases the number of monitoring years were 27 and 32 for lc and lk respectively in fact considering the earlier convergence of accumulative cnrs even if we had less data we could determine the reliability of the overall relationship for example for the chl tn relationship in lk if we had approximately 9 years of monitoring data we could determine that the overall relationship converges and is thus reliable to inform lake eutrophication management 4 4 implications and generalizations of the proposed framework we have shown how our novel statistical framework can reveal the temporal dependence of cnr including the exploration of variation of annual cnrs and the convergence of accumulative cnr to the overall relationship here we summarize implications of the statistical framework to lake specific eutrophication management firstly by comparing the overall with annual cnrs we can illustrate the variation of annual relationships and how they compare to the overall relationship in our case the variation is large indicating that annual cnrs are likely not adequate to inform lake eutrophication management secondly via the comparison of the overall and accumulative relationships we determined whether the current dataset is adequate to develop a reliable cnr which could be used to inform lake specific eutrophication management since a reliable cnr is essential to lake eutrophication management our novel statistical framework is of vital importance to ensure the effectiveness of corresponding lake eutrophication control actions given the flexibility of our proposed framework we suggest that it will be generalizable to many ecological applications through the following considerations firstly with the accumulating of tn tp and chl monitoring data our framework has great potential for generalization to other lakes therefore the reliability of the framework can be tested in turn since phytoplankton biomass may be co limited by both nitrogen and phosphorus the n p ratios dolman et al 2016 or joint nutrients liang et al 2021b poikane et al 2019 can be introduced to generate cnrs to further reveal the temporal dependence the novel framework can be further improved by applying the ecologically based quality targets for water framework directive in europe to assess the temporal dependence of cnrs carvalho et al 2008 poikane et al 2010 poikane et al 2014 considering the lack of statistical metrics to determine trend convergence of accumulative cnrs in our framework a reliable indicator to better assess the trend convergence is an area of future research the method applied in the framework can also be extended to other methods such as a bayesian qr approach liang et al 2021a and qr neural network cannon 2011 5 conclusions the contribution of this study is the proposed statistical framework which can reveal the temporal dependence of cnr in the framework we explored annual variation in cnrs and the convergence of accumulative cnrs to the overall relationship the statistical framework is applied in lc and lk the framework effectively shows the variation of annual cnrs our statistical framework can be used to inform lake specific eutrophication management by revealing the temporal dependence of cnrs particularly by answering the question about whether or not a developed cnr is reliable a reliable chl nutrient relationship is needed for nutrient criteria establishment which is important for informing eutrophication controldecision making processes therefore our proposed framework can help guide lake specific eutrophication management credit authorship contribution statement qianlinglin

temporal dependence of cnrs in this study we propose a novel statistical framework to reveal lake specific temporal dependence of cnrs with the application of qr in the framework we develop overall the entire dataset annual subsets for each year and accumulative subsets collected before a certain year cnrs we attempt to 1 quantify any potential biases in annual relationships by comparing the overall and annual cnrs and 2 determine whether or not data accumulation is appropriate for developing a reliable cnr by comparing the overall and accumulative relationships we use data from lake champlain lc located in the united states and lake kasumigaura lk located in japan as case studies to illustrate steps necessary to utilize this novel framework we further discuss how our statistical framework could inform lake specific eutrophication management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we chose lc and lk as case studies based on two considerations namely the availability of long term monitoring data and lake specific physical characteristics physical characteristics measures of climate and nutrient and chl conditions for these two lakes are summarized in table 1 lc is located in the northeastern united states it is a deep lake with an average depth of 20 m and with a surface area of 1127 km2 the lake is well known for its large watershed area to lake area ratio 19 1 isles et al 2017 lk is located in ibaraki prefecture approximately 50 km northeast of tokyo japan it is the second largest shallow lake in japan with an average depth of 4 0 m the lake has a surface area of 171 km2 the watershed to lake area ratio is approximately 9 1 arai and fukushima 2014 tsuchiya et al 2019 in this study we included total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in our analysis because they are the primary limiting nutrients of lake phytoplankton phillips et al 2008 stow and cha 2013 the concentrations of tn tp and chl for estimating cnrs were obtained from the long term monitoring datasets for lc and lk the monitoring data for lc are freely available at https dec vermont gov watershed lakes ponds lake champlain a total of 4413 paired tn tp and chl concentrations for 12 sampling stations in lc from 1992 to 2018 were used in this study the lk database was obtained from the national institute for environmental studies 2016 and accessed via https db cger nies go jp gem moni e inter gems database kasumi index html 01 01 2020 monthly time series of 10 long term sampling stations spanning the years 1985 2016 were used and resulted in 3807 paired chl tn and tp values for lk all biweekly and monthly monitoring of tn tp and chl concentrations were directly applied to develop cnrs in lc average tn tp and chl concentrations were 403 3 mg m 3 24 2 mg m 3 and 6 3 mg m 3 respectively table 1 spatial variation of trophic status was observed in lc with some areas being eutrophic xu et al 2015b in contrast lk is hypereutrophic largely due to the extremely high loads of organic matter and nutrients ishii et al 2009 masunaga and komuro 2020 the average tn tp and chl concentrations were 1511 2 mg m 3 115 8 mg m 3 and 61 6 mg m 3 respectively table 1 in addition concentration ranges for tn tp and chl concentrations spanned a wider range in lk than those in lc 2 2 framework to reveal the temporal dependence of cnrs the proposed novel statistical framework to quantify potential temporal dependence of cnrs is shown in fig 1 the framework includes three steps to estimate the overall annual and accumulative cnrs both chl tn and chl tp relationships were developed because both nutrients might influence chl concentrations within lakes conley et al 2009 in the framework we want to explore two potential temporal dependencies that may exist on the one hand we compare the overall and annual relationships to show if there exist biases in annual relationships on the other hand we compare the overall and accumulative relationships to determine whether data accumulation is sufficient to develop a reliable cnr in the proposed framework the major difference among the three steps is the data used to develop the cnr the first step is to develop the overall cnr using all available data fig 1a next we develop annual cnrs based on the data collected in every year fig 1b in the third step we develop accumulative cnrs using the data collected before a specified year for example for the accumulative cnr for the year of 2010 we use all data collected before and including 2010 fig 1c following these steps we can determine if cnrs for the initial year are identical in step 2 and step 3 the cnr for the last year in the third step is the same as the overall cnr in the first step to explore the variation of annual cnrs we compare the overall relationship with annual relationships here the overall relationship could be treated as the baseline if annual relationships all concentrate near the overall relationship with small biases we could determine that even an annual cnr is reliable to inform lake specific eutrophication management if the annual relationships deviate from the overall mean relationship substantially it is worth exploring whether or not the overall relationship is reliable enough if there is large variation among annual cnrs we can then compare the overall relationship with accumulative relationships to determine the reliability of the overall relationship as aforementioned the accumulative cnr for the last year is the same as the overall relationship however if the accumulative relationships are very similar to the overall relationship several years before the last year bias less than 10 we could conclude that the cnr is relatively stable over time therefore the overall relationship may be reliable enough to inform lake eutrophication management otherwise if the bias between the accumulative relationship and the overall relationship remains large until the year just before the last year the overall relationship might not be adequate and more monitoring data may be required 2 3 qr for cnr development in the framework we apply qr to develop cnrs in all three steps the main function of qr is expressed as eq 1 koenker and bassett 1978 1 y i b 0 b 1 x i ε i where i represents the order of observations i 1 2 m m is the sample size y represents the log transformed chl concentration logchl and x represents the log transformed nutrient concentration logtp or logtn b 0 and b 1 represent the regression intercept and slope since all the data are log transformed the regression slope b 1 is interpreted as the percent change in chl concentration per 1 change in tn and tp concentration qian 2017 ε is the error the parameter estimation in linear qr is based on the minimum of absolute error eq 2 koenker and bassett 1978 2 min i i y i b 0 b 1 x i τ y i b 0 b 1 x i i i y i b 0 b 1 x i 1 τ y i b 0 b 1 x i where τ represents the quantile of the response in our study τ is chosen to be 0 9 following common practices when quantifying the limiting effect in ecological studies chassot et al 2010 coefficients of determination r 1 for 0 9 quantile were calculated to infer the goodness of fit to the upper boundary of data distributions for cnrs the r 1 value is calculated as follows r 1 1 sum f sum r where sum f refers to the sum of weighted absolute deviations minimized to estimate each of the full parameter models and sum r refers to the sum of weighted absolute deviations minimized to estimate each of corresponding reduced parameter models of logchl b 0 ε koenker and machado 1999 in order to be comparable to the olsr derived r 2 the qr derived r 1 for 0 9 quantile were converted to r 2 which are calculated as follows r 2 1 1 r 1 2 mckean and sievers 1987 schooley and wiens 2005 xu et al 2015a all models were fitted using the r software r version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 the algorithm for parameter estimation of qr models was implemented in the quantreg package koenker 2020 the code for the development of overall annual and accumulative cnrs is freely available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4087838 3 results 3 1 overall and annual cnr overall cnrs based on all available data are shown in fig 2 the overall cnr describes the upper response of chl to each nutrient in lc the qr estimated regression slopes of tn and tp are 1 33 and 0 87 respectively indicating that a 1 increase decrease for tn and tp concentration would lead to a 1 33 and 0 87 increase decrease of chl concentration in lk the qr estimated regression slopes of tn and tp are 0 85 and 0 86 respectively indicating that a 1 increase decrease of tn and tp concentration would lead to a 0 85 and 0 86 increase decrease of chl concentration it is worth noting that the overall cnrs derived from the qr method fit better than those derived from the olsr method with higher r 2 values for qr than for olsr fig 2 generally there were no apparent patterns in the annual variation for the annual cnrs in both lakes regression parameters show large interannual variation figs 3 and 4 parameter estimation results of annual cnrs in lc are shown in fig 3 hollow triangles for the chl tn relationship regression slopes range from 0 56 to 2 05 with an average of 1 35 0 41 standard deviation regression intercepts range from 4 21 to 0 50 with an average of 2 46 1 01 for the chl tp relationship average regression slopes and intercepts were 0 87 0 25 and 0 16 0 34 respectively corresponding ranges were from 0 34 to 1 54 and from 0 90 to 0 51 parameter estimation results of annual cnrs in lk are shown in fig 4 hollow triangles for the chl tn relationship regression slopes range from 0 05 to 1 36 with an average of 0 79 0 31 regression intercepts range from 2 24 to 2 03 with an average of 0 50 0 92 for the chl tp relationship average regression slopes and intercepts were 0 96 0 29 and 0 002 0 57 respectively corresponding ranges were from 0 25 to 1 56 and from 1 22 to 1 38 despite of relatively larger ranges of tn tp and chl concentrations in lk compared with lc estimated regressions parameters for these two lakes did not show many differences 3 2 accumulative cnrs parameter estimation results for the accumulative cnrs are shown in figs 3 and 4 solid dots unlike the annual cnrs regression parameters of accumulative cnrs show an obvious trend with year and generally converge to stable values i e the parameters values of overall relationships over time in lc regression slopes for the chl tn and chl tp relationships both increase with increasing year while regressions intercepts both have decreasing trends fig 3 solid dots the regression slope for the chl tn relationship increases from 0 56 to 1 22 in 1995 and then become very similar to the 1 33 slope estimated for the overall relationship regression intercepts decrease from 0 58 to 2 23 for 1995 and then converge to be very close to the overall relationship for the chl tp relationship the slope increases from 0 49 to 0 80 for the year 2004 and then become very close to the 0 87 slope estimated for overall relationship the intercept decreases from 0 36 to 0 05 for the year 2004 and then becomes very close to the overall relationship in lk patterns reverse both regression slopes decrease and both intercepts increase over time fig 4 solid dots the regression slope for the chl tn relationship increases from 1 02 to 1 18 then decreases to 0 86 in the year 1993 and generally converges to the slope of overall relationships regression intercept decreases from 1 16 to 1 61 and then increases to 0 68 in the year 1993 and converges to the overall relationships for the chl tp relationship the slope increases from 1 01 to 1 22 and then decrease to 0 93 in the year 2001 and generally converges to the slope of overall relationships regression intercept decreases from 0 08 to 0 31 then increases to 0 10 in the year 2001 and tends to the overall relationships 4 discussion 4 1 the difference of nutrient limitations between two lakes difference in the upper boundary equations on the cnrs for lc and lk indicates that the nutrients limitation of chlorophyll varies between these two case study lakes nnutrients limitation variation may be due to the difference in hydrodynamic disturbance of these lakes conjecturally the geographic location and water depth of the two lakes are the main reason for different hydrodynamic conditions lc is relatively stable in terms of hydrodynamic conditions due to its deep depth table 1 in contrast the shallow lk is influenced by the mixing effect of storms especially typhoons the energy of these storms leads to the suspension of sediments and an increase the non algal turbidity thus enhancing light limitation of phytoplankton brezonik et al 2019 jones and knowlton 2005 zhang et al 2017 therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the hydrodynamic disturbance is the primary factor influencing the nutrient limitation by the result of lower slopes for chl nutrients upper boundary equations for lk compared to lc fig 2 the differences in nutrients limitation of chlorophyll between lakes indicate that lake specific nutrient criteria are not universally applicable and the lake specific upper boundary equation of chl nutrient should be calculated using a lake specific dataset in this study the qr derived chl nutrient upper boundaries reflecting peak algal biomass response to nutrients under an ideal condition fit better than olsr derived models which cannot account for unmeasured drivers for chl fig 2 therefore it is reasonable to assume that qr provides more insight into the ecological concept of law of the minimum which could help lake managers to better understand and establish more accurate nutrient criteria here we introduce a chl standard of 15 0 mg m 3 applied by usepa 2000 as an example to show that the calculation of nutrient thresholds by the upper boundary cnr is different between the two case study lakes it appears that nutrient criteria derived from the overall chl nutrient equations are significantly different between these two case lakes given the target chl concentration of 15 0 mg m 3 the thresholds of tn and tp for lc are 458 8 mg m 3 logtn 2 66 and 32 9 mg m 3 logtp 1 52 respectively the thresholds for tn and tp for lk are 146 1 mg m 3 logtn 2 16 and 13 4 mg m 3 logtp 1 13 respectively this suggests that lake specific nutrient criteria developed using upper boundary qr equations will be useful for informing lake eutrophication management 4 2 variation of annual cnr there was large variations in regressions parameters among annual cnrs in both lakes figs 3 and 4 more importantly regression parameters in some years differed substantially from regression parameters of the overall relationship for example in lc for the chl tn relationship in 1992 the regression slope was estimated to 0 56 and the difference from the overall value is 1 36 times the slope of 1992 in lk for the chl tp relationship in 2010 the regression intercept was estimated at 0 88 and the difference from the overall value of 0 21 was 1 24 times the intercept of 2010 because the cnr is determined by the regression slope and intercept together we further explored the deviation of annual cnrs with the overall relationship fig 5 we found that annual relationships vary substantially among years and are different from the overall relationships in fact the biases between some annual relationships and the overall relationship were very large for example for the chl tn relationship in lc the regression equation in 1999 was logchl 2 05 0 27 logtn 4 21 0 69 which was different from the overall regression equation logchl 1 33 0 09 logtn 2 36 0 22 assuming that the tn is 1000 mg m 3 the chl derived from the 1999 regression equation is 87 1 mg m 3 and that from overall equation is 42 7 mg m 3 additionally assuming that the tp is 100 mg m 3 the chl calculated from the regression equation in 1986 is 123 0 mg m 3 which is 1 45 times that of overall global climate change and regional watershed nutrient dynamics may result in annual variation of chl nutrient upper boundary equations generally erratic fluctuation in nutrient limitation on chl is attributed to annually differences in temperature which is vital for phytoplankton growth huisman et al 2018 huo et al 2019 paterson et al 2017 additionally differences in annual precipitation is expected to influence concentrations of non algal suspended solids by watershed inputs which contributes to variations in the slopes of chl nutrient upper boundary equations jones and knowlton 2005 yuan and jones 2020 as the different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus are transported from the watershed to the lake variable precipitation intensity alters the input n p which further affects the utilization of nutrients by phytoplankton in lakes isles et al 2017 considering the large biases between the overall relationship and annual relationships in some years for both lakes and both nutrients we conclude that the annual cnr do in fact vary short term monitoring might not be able to reflect the overall ecological process influencing nutrient phytoplankton dynamics over longer temporal scales smol 2019 despite annual relationships in some years being close to the overall relationship applying a cnr developed using data from a single year might mislead lake eutrophication management decisions to develop a reliable lake specific cnr more data collected over more years rather than more data collected in a single year are likely required 4 3 stabilization of cnr with data accumulation after determining that data from a single year might not be adequate to develop a reliable cnr and that additional data collected over more years is desirable the next question is how to determine whether or not the accumulated data are sufficient to adequately characterize the lake s true cnr in our framework we answer this question by comparing the overall relationship with accumulative relationships we consider the cnr stable when the difference between coefficients for a certain dataset and the overall relationship is 10 or less as we mentioned before parameters of accumulative cnrs generally converge to parameters of the overall relationships we visually identified the year at which parameters of accumulative relationship and overall relationships become similar converge in lc for the tn chl and tp chl relationship the year is approximate 1995 and 2012 respectively in lk for the tn chl and tp chl relationship the year is approximate 1990 and 2001 respectively moreover accumulative relationships tend to converge to the overall cnrs as more years are sampled fig 6 for example for the chl tn relationship in lc the accumulative relationship for the initial year differs from the overall chl tn relationship as more years are included in the calculation of the relationship the accumulative relationship becomes closer to the overall relationship finally accumulative relationships for years near the last year are almost coincident with the overall relationship with variation between the two less than 10 the chl tp relationships in lc and those in lk have similar patterns the convergent trend of accumulative cnr to the corresponding overall relationship indicates that the overall relationship is reliable to inform lake eutrophication since it becomes relatively stable after several years from the initial year in our cases the number of monitoring years were 27 and 32 for lc and lk respectively in fact considering the earlier convergence of accumulative cnrs even if we had less data we could determine the reliability of the overall relationship for example for the chl tn relationship in lk if we had approximately 9 years of monitoring data we could determine that the overall relationship converges and is thus reliable to inform lake eutrophication management 4 4 implications and generalizations of the proposed framework we have shown how our novel statistical framework can reveal the temporal dependence of cnr including the exploration of variation of annual cnrs and the convergence of accumulative cnr to the overall relationship here we summarize implications of the statistical framework to lake specific eutrophication management firstly by comparing the overall with annual cnrs we can illustrate the variation of annual relationships and how they compare to the overall relationship in our case the variation is large indicating that annual cnrs are likely not adequate to inform lake eutrophication management secondly via the comparison of the overall and accumulative relationships we determined whether the current dataset is adequate to develop a reliable cnr which could be used to inform lake specific eutrophication management since a reliable cnr is essential to lake eutrophication management our novel statistical framework is of vital importance to ensure the effectiveness of corresponding lake eutrophication control actions given the flexibility of our proposed framework we suggest that it will be generalizable to many ecological applications through the following considerations firstly with the accumulating of tn tp and chl monitoring data our framework has great potential for generalization to other lakes therefore the reliability of the framework can be tested in turn since phytoplankton biomass may be co limited by both nitrogen and phosphorus the n p ratios dolman et al 2016 or joint nutrients liang et al 2021b poikane et al 2019 can be introduced to generate cnrs to further reveal the temporal dependence the novel framework can be further improved by applying the ecologically based quality targets for water framework directive in europe to assess the temporal dependence of cnrs carvalho et al 2008 poikane et al 2010 poikane et al 2014 considering the lack of statistical metrics to determine trend convergence of accumulative cnrs in our framework a reliable indicator to better assess the trend convergence is an area of future research the method applied in the framework can also be extended to other methods such as a bayesian qr approach liang et al 2021a and qr neural network cannon 2011 5 conclusions the contribution of this study is the proposed statistical framework which can reveal the temporal dependence of cnr in the framework we explored annual variation in cnrs and the convergence of accumulative cnrs to the overall relationship the statistical framework is applied in lc and lk the framework effectively shows the variation of annual cnrs our statistical framework can be used to inform lake specific eutrophication management by revealing the temporal dependence of cnrs particularly by answering the question about whether or not a developed cnr is reliable a reliable chl nutrient relationship is needed for nutrient criteria establishment which is important for informing eutrophication controldecision making processes therefore our proposed framework can help guide lake specific eutrophication management credit authorship contribution statement qianlinglin

3862,peatland carbon cycling is critical for the land atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases particularly under changing environments warming and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide eco2 concentrations directly enhance peatland methane ch4 emission and indirectly affect ch4 processes by altering hydrological conditions an ecosystem model elm spruce the land model of the e3sm model was used to understand the hydrological feedback mechanisms on ch4 emission in a temperate peatland under a warming gradient and eco2 treatments we found that the water table level was a critical regulator of hydrological feedbacks that affect peatland ch4 dynamics the simulated water table levels dropped as warming intensified but slightly increased under eco2 evaporation and vegetation transpiration determined the water table level in peatland ecosystems although warming significantly stimulated ch4 emission the hydrological feedbacks leading to a reduced water table mitigated the stimulating effects of warming on ch4 emission the hydrological feedback for eco2 effects was weak the comparison between modeled results with data from a field experiment and a global synthesis of observations supports the model simulation of hydrological feedbacks in projecting ch4 flux under warming and eco2 the elm spruce model showed relatively small parameter induced uncertainties on hydrological variables and their impacts on ch4 fluxes a sensitivity analysis confirmed a strong hydrological feedback in the first three years and the feedback diminished after four years of warming hydrology moderated warming impacts on ch4 cycling suggest that the indirect effect of warming on hydrological feedbacks is fundamental for accurately projecting peatland ch4 flux under climate warming keywords warming elevated carbon dioxide hydrology methane model peatland 1 introduction peatlands store 16 33 of the global terrestrial soil carbon bridgham et al 2006 gorham 1991 and play an important role in regulating climate change peatlands act as net sinks of carbon dioxide co2 and net sources of atmospheric methane ch4 due to the prevalence of waterlogged conditions dinsmore et al 2009 harriss et al 1985 huttunen et al 2003 mcnamara et al 2008 therefore water table level wt is a vital parameter controlling peatland ch4 emission dise et al 1993 2011 laine et al 1996 moore and roulet 1993 white et al 2008 any level of climate warming might alter hydrological processes and soil microbial physiology nykänen et al 1998 thereby modifying co2 and ch4 emission and changing c storage in peatlands bridgham et al 1995 keller et al 2004 a rise in the wt might strengthen ch4 emission by stimulating the activities of methanogens nykänen et al 1998 turetsky et al 2008 or reduce ch4 emission by reducing the transport rate of ch4 to the atmosphere blodau and moore 2003 brown et al 2014 knorr et al 2008 a wt drop might promote the oxidation of ch4 and thus reduce ch4 emission zhang et al 2007 warming and elevated co2 eco2 represent two critical global change factors affecting ch4 flux in peatlands xu et al 2010 xu and tian 2012 turetsky et al 2008 updegraff et al 2001 for example warming stimulates peatland ch4 emission by directly enhancing ch4 transport from soil to the atmosphere turetsky et al 2008 in addition warmer temperatures stimulate methanogenesis more than methanotrophy dunfield et al 1993 and thus reinforces ch4 emission elevated eco2 has the potential to enhance ch4 emission by increasing plant biomass thereby providing a c substrate for ch4 production dijkstra et al 2012 hutchin et al 1995 inubushi et al 2003 saarnio et al 1998 however peatlands are complex ecohydrological systems and the hydrological feedbacks linked to the wt can reinforce the climatic impacts on ch4 emission waddington et al 2015 water table dynamics are a function of precipitation evaporation transpiration and drainage near surface runoff or deeper vertical drainage to aquifers a wt drop is expected to increase aerobic c mineralization song et al 2018 which in turn provides more available c substrates for methanogenesis on the contrary a low wt may also suppress peatland ch4 emission due to an expansion of the ch4 oxidation zone associated with aerobic soil and a contraction of the methanogenesis zone associated with anoxic saturated soil whalen and reeburgh 1996 2000 white et al 2008 thus warming affects the wt level via strengthened evapotranspiration reduced soil moisture and altered precipitation regimes allison and treseder 2008 verburg et al 1999 meanwhile the stimulating effects of eco2 on vegetation biomass might lead to increases in water loss via canopy evaporation and transportation and decreases in water input via canopy interception waddington et al 2015 such hydrological changes might interact with warming and eco2 to complicate ch4 cycling represented in peatland ecosystem models large uncertainties exist in projecting the responses of ch4 emission to warming and eco2 in peatland ecosystems bridgham et al 2013 ma et al 2017 due to the unknown mechanisms of ch4 production and emission associated with complicated hydrological feedbacks a shift in microbial community composition associated with vegetation dynamics might occur under long term warming and eco2 which may offset the effects of short term changes in wt level blodau 2002 szumigalski and bayley 1997 tveit et al 2015 in particular changes in plant species composition can affect ecosystem functions weltzin et al 2000 including evapotranspiration and co2 and ch4 fluxes a few biogeochemical models have accounted for wt fluctuation and impacts on ch4 fluxes kettunen 2003 ma et al 2017 segers et al 2001a b c xu et al 2016 however the mechanisms by which soil hydrological processes respond to warming and eco2 and affect peatland ch4 fluxes remain elusive ricciuto et al 2021 this study focuses on the hydrological

is a new version of the energy exascale earth system e3sm land model elm uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the hydrological processes controlling peatland ch4 emission with this study we aimed to address 1 how do hydrological processes respond to warming and eco2 2 what are the mechanisms by which hydrological processes feedback to warming and eco2 in terms of affecting ch4 flux 2 methodology 2 1 data source and model experiment our study was based on the spruce and peatland responses under changing environments spruce experiment hanson et al 2017 located

implemented in the spruce field experiment within 10 open top enclosures hanson et al 2017 six of these 10 treatments were selected for model simulations using elm spruce 0 c and four warming levels at ambient co2 and 0 c at eco2 within the enclosures hydrology is isolated using a subsurface corral system sebestyen and griffiths 2016 so that the treatments may cause shifts in water table levels without inducing lateral flows from the bog surrounding the enclosures this model was originally developed upon clm4 5 with improved representations of hydrology shi et al 2015 moss shi et al 2021 and ch4 cycling xu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 ricciuto et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 the initial atmospheric forcing data from 2001 to 2014 used in the model were developed by the spruce team ricciuto et al 2021 the model was implemented for three stages including the accelerated spin up thornton and rosenbloom 2005 final spin up and transient runs then six independent experimental simulations from 2015 to 2019 were conducted to examine how ch4 emission responds to warming and eco2 over a 5 year period for a comparison with the field experiment the cumulative changes in modeled variables in response to warming and eco2 were calculated relative to the control treatment unwarmed ambient eco2 responses more information and evaluations of model experiments are available in our previous publications ricciuto et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 all positive ch4 fluxes indicate emission while negative ch4 fluxes indicate uptake uncertainty of model outputs was quantified by focusing on ten key parameters

most important hydrological processes in regulating the wt level and affecting ch4 emissions from peatlands a global sensitivity analysis was conducted based on a previous study on the default clm hou

direction of the parameter changes xu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 3 research synthesis and field observational data both the field observational data and a compiled dataset from the literature were used to validate model performance experimental data from the spruce project were used to evaluate the site level simulation hanson et al 2020 mcpartland et al 2019 norby et al 2019 the evapotranspiration et warren et al 2021 transpiration leaf area index lai wt runoff sebestyen and griffiths 2016 and soil water content are at the s1 bog measured by the spruce team hanson et al 2020 measurements of runoff or lateral flow are known to have errors during high water periods and therefore were not a clear quantitative measure of warming and eco2 responses nevertheless the observational data of runoff support the warming induced wt drop as simulated by the model additionally published literature was surveyed to generate a global synthesis of warming and eco2 experimental results in peatlands to evaluate the broader applicability of the elm spruce model we executed a keyword search algorithm searching warming or rising temperature or elevated co2 or rising co2 or fumigation co2 or enrichment co2 and ch4 or methane and wetland or peatland or bog or marsh or swamp or fen in the web of science and google scholar databases the latest search was completed in march 2020 published literature was screened and the data were included if they a had exact values or graphs for variables related to ch4 emissions and hydrological processes and b provided detailed information on the wetland type s and treatment setting s eight eco2 studies and five warming studies met these criteria table s1 five variables were chosen and extracted from these relevant publications including et trans lai wt and sw for these selected studies the air temperature increased by 0 85 4 10 c in warming experiments and the atmospheric co2 concentrations were elevated by 120 350 ppm in the eco2 experiments the duration of experiments ranged from 0 13 to 12 years all data from warming experiments were standardized to per c of warming c 1 while the data from eco2 experiments were standardized to per 100 ppm v elevated co2 100 ppm 1 4 results 4 1 canopy hydrological processes as modeled using elm spruce warming and eco2 largely influenced canopy hydrological processes the cumulative effects of eco2 over the 5 year simulation were positive on whole ecosystem canopy interception and transpiration whereas warming effects were negative for canopy evaporation and transpiration fig 1 d f simulated canopy interception evaporation and transpiration showed the same seasonal patterns increasing in spring reaching a maximum in summer and decreasing in fall fig 1a c the warming effects on canopy interception followed the gradient of warming treatments canopy interception increased with warming in the first 3 years of warming primarily driven by earlier leaf out but then decreased fig 1a as driven by the projected decrease in peak lai figure s1 the cumulative responses of canopy interception departure from ambient simulation also intensified rapidly in the first 3 years then weakened after reaching peaks of 16 0 mm 17 7 mm 18 9 mm and 12 0 mm in 2017 under 2 25 c 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c respectively fig 1d even the cumulative effects under 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c tended to diminish after the third warming year on the other hand the cumulative eco2 effects on canopy interception continued increasing over the entire period and eventually reached 9 2 mm fig 1d after 5 years the cumulative effects of simulated warming on canopy evaporation were negative fig 1e due to the declining lai figure s1 and drying soil fig 3d h in contrast warming effects were consistently positive on canopy transpiration fig 1f the magnitude of the cumulative effects increased with warming strength the cumulative warming effects reinforced canopy evaporation in the first two years then started to decrease in the following years the cumulative canopy evaporation changed by 1 6 mm 7 9 mm 17 2 mm and 29 5 mm under the four warming treatments respectively the cumulative canopy transpiration was enhanced by 156 8 mm 228 9 mm 250 7 mm and 188 1 after the 5 year warming period the cumulative 5 year effect of warming on canopy transpiration under 9 00 c reduced from the fourth warming year despite increasing under 2 25 c 4 50 c and 6 75 c and the cumulative magnitude increased with the warming strength in contrast the eco2 treatment cumulatively strengthened the canopy evaporation response and slowly weakened the canopy transpiration response relative to the ambient co2 treatment fig 1e f the cumulative canopy evaporation increased by 16 8 mm whereas cumulative canopy transpiration decreased by 119 9 mm by the end of the fifth year 4 2 surface hydrological processes ground evaporation snow depth surface water depth depth of water table on soil surface and surface lateral runoff varied seasonally over the 5 year simulation period fig 2 a d overall warming cumulatively led to lower while eco2 cumulatively led to higher snow depth surface water depth and surface runoff fig 2f g h both warming and eco2 diminished ground evaporation fig 2e the cumulative effects of warming and eco2 on surface hydrological processes were stronger when the hydrological metrics reached their maximums during spring snowmelt periods all measures of ground level hydrology reached maximums in march due to snow melt and then were drawn down to lower levels throughout the rest of the year lower levels persisted until the next melting season with slight fluctuations depending on the timing of precipitation events hanson et al 2020 the magnitudes of the cumulative effects of warming on three ground hydrological variables evaporation snow depth and surface water table increased with the warming gradient and tended to be comparable under the 6 75 c and 9 00 c treatments especially in the last year of the simulations fig 2e g surface lateral runoff under 9 00 c showed the same magnitude of response as the 6 75 c treatment in the second warming year and then had a smaller cumulative effect than under 6 75 c in the fourth warming year fig 2h the rates of ground evaporation cumulatively decreased by 7 2 mm 20 0 mm 26 3 mm and 23 8 mm along the warming gradient after 5 years while eco2 decreased the ground evaporation rate by 11 1 mm which was similar to the response of ground evaporation under 2 25 c fig 2e warming cumulatively reduced snow depth and displayed a larger suppression effect in the fifth year compared with the first four years especially in the warmest treatment fig 2f at the end of the simulations the cumulative reductions in snow depth when compared to the ambient treatment showed the decreases of 5 7 m 10 6 m 14 6 m and 16 5 m along the warming gradient in contrast the eco2 treatment had a slight positive effect on snow depth and snow depth cumulatively increased only by 0 9 m over five simulation years fig 2f the surface water depth and surface runoff declined under the warming treatments and the cumulative reductions gradually strengthened over time in contrast both surface water depth and runoff cumulatively increased under eco2 furthermore surface water depth was more responsive than the surface runoff to warming and eco2 at the end of the 5 year simulations cumulative surface water depth decreased by 499 0 mm 493 6 mm 491 3 mm and 112 4 mm along the warming gradient and increased by 446 3 mm under eco2 warming cumulatively diminished surface runoff by 49 9 mm 70 4 mm 90 7 mm and 78 5 mm from the 2 25 c to 9 00 c warming treatments respectively whereas eco2 cumulatively enhanced runoff by 7 7 mm at the end of the simulations 4 3 belowground hydrologic and thermal processes water infiltration to deep soils and soil temperature along the soil profile exhibited similar seasonality increasing in warm seasons and decreasing in cold seasons however the total wt level and soil water content showed opposite seasonal dynamics declining with high soil temperature and rising with low soil temperature respectively fig 3 a d overall warming and eco2 had opposite cumulative effects on soil temperature water table level and soil water content but both cumulatively raised soil infiltration after four years and the final effect of eco2 was minimal compared to the effect of 2 25 c warming treatment fig 3e h warming reinforced the soil water infiltration especially under 2 25 c treatments but decreased the water table level and soil water content fig 3a d the cumulative effects on the belowground hydrothermal metrics were intensified along with warming and tended to be comparable over time for the soil water infiltration and water table level under 6 75 c and 9 00 c however eco2 reduced infiltration during the first 4 years while water table level and soil water content increased fig 3e h the cumulative changes in infiltration showed highly seasonal patterns displaying a greater response to warming in warm seasons the rates of the infiltration cumulatively increased by 103 5 mm 147 1 mm 283 0 mm and 305 8 mm along the warming gradient and the rate cumulatively increased by 92 7 mm under eco2 at the end of simulations soil temperature increased more under more intense warming fig 3e after the 5 year simulations warming cumulatively increased the soil temperature by 1263 2 c 2759 8 c 4390 7 c and 5687 2 c under 2 25 c 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c respectively eco2 cumulatively decreased the soil temperature by 107 1 c and the effects of eco2 were considerably very small comparing with the cumulative effects of warming water table level and soil water content generally declined with warming over the simulation period but they showed larger responses to 6 75 c than other warming treatments fig 3g and 3h the cumulative reductions of the water table level diminished in the fifth warming year at the end of 5 years of warming the water table level cumulatively decreased by 20 0 mm 32 3 mm 28 8 mm and 28 3 mm and the soil water content cumulatively decreased by 1 3 3 6 2 6 and 1 4 along the warming gradient meanwhile at the end of the eco2 simulations the soil water content increased by 1 5 and water table level cumulatively rose by 17 4 mm fig 3g and 3h 4 4 a mechanistic framework for hydrological feedbacks on ch4 cycling under warming and eco2 the mechanisms of warming and eco2 impacts on ch4 cycling were distinct due to their differing effects on hydrological processes fig 4 warming suppressed net primary productivity npp and lai figure s1 and therefore diminished canopy evaporative loss mainly via reducing evaporative area conversely warming enhanced canopy interception by increasing interception duration despite decreasing lai the reason is that warming led to an earlier and extended growing season for deciduous tree species table s2 such as tamarack larix laricina and various understory shrubs in the s1 bog thereby suppressing throughfall inputs as a source for surface moisture and ground evaporation canopy transpiration was also intensified by warming due to higher vapor pressure deficiencies in the enclosures in addition rising canopy transpiration dominated the rapid water loss under warming and the enhanced water loss was 6 4 98 times larger than the decreases in ground and canopy evaporation at the end of 5 year simulations additionally warming promoted the melting of snow and ice thereby decreasing snow accumulation with snow melt surface water depth and surface runoff increased following the further enhancement of soil water infiltration with soil freezing surface water depth dropped and then ground evaporation diminished however during the dry summer seasons under warming water table levels surface runoff and soil water content decreased as a result of the rising water uptake by vegetation this drainage of surface peat also created more storage above the water table and allowed for high infiltration when precipitation inputs were adequate to offset transpiration losses lower water table levels inhibited ch4 production by shrinking the anoxic zone for methanogenesis however soil temperature increased due to warming and enhanced ch4 production in the regions that remained anoxic ricciuto et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 the decreased water table level which allowed more oxygen to penetrate into soils and promoted mineralization of soil organic matter som led to an increased production of substrates for methanogenesis ch4 production was stimulated by warmer temperature leading to the consumption of available substrates that resulted in an actual loss of substrate availability warming had little impact on simulated ch4 oxidation yuan et al 2021 but enhanced the transport of ch4 from peat to the atmosphere the soil ch4 concentrations temporarily increased because of stimulated ch4 production but eventually declined due to enhanced transport of ch4 through a combination of plant mediated transport diffusion and ebullition ricciuto et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 overall despite the inhibition of ch4 production via a lower water table the net effect of warming was an increase in ch4 emission because of the enhancement of methanogenesis and ch4 transport ch4 emission was reinforced in the eco2 treatment but the hydrological feedback to eco2 showed different effects on ch4 dynamics fig 4 the npp increase under eco2 resulted in a rise in canopy interception and a decline in ground evaporation canopy evaporation increased with greater canopy interception whereas canopy transpiration was suppressed under eco2 overall water loss from soils decreased due to the decrease in the canopy transpiration under eco2 additionally due to the increasing canopy shade under higher leaf area stimulated by eco2 soil temperature and ground evaporation decreased which led to higher snow depth and increased surface runoff when snow melted the higher water table level and soil water content facilitated methanogenesis meanwhile increased npp stimulated substrate supply and higher som mineralization strengthened ch4 production more ch4 was produced by methanogens which led to higher ch4 concentrations in soils intensified by the trivial changes in ch4 oxidation yuan et al 2021 overall the hydrological feedback to eco2 resulted in positive feedback on ch4 emission 4 5 uncertainty analysis the hydrological parameter induced uncertainties in hydrological processes are relatively small when compared to the uncertainties in ecosystem carbon processes from biogeochemical parameters in the current elm spruce model yuan et al 2021 among the main hydrological and ch4 processes under different warming and eco2 levels the prediction intervals of canopy transpiration canopy evaporation ground evaporation and ch4 fluxes showed narrower and less seasonal variation than wt fig 5 a e this suggested that a relatively high uncertainty existed in wt simulations due to the choices of hydrological parameters and there may be seasonal differences in the determination of hydrological parameters for simulating wt under different warming levels and eco2 we did not find large differences in uncertainty intervals of hydrological and ch4 processes caused by hydrological parameters however the uncertainties from hydrological parameters increased with the simulation duration particularly for the wt level and ch4 fluxes fig 5f j and figure s2 4 6 sensitivity analysis the hydrological feedbacks regulating water table level and ch4 fluxes showed substantially different patterns among the six treatments during the 5 year simulations fig 6 no consistency was observed in the sensitivities of wt and net ch4 fluxes to each hydrological parameter for example the fff subsurface i e the decay factor for surface runoff seemed to be a stronger factor controlling the water table level in the control 2 25 c and 4 50 c treatments fig 6a while the ch4 fluxes tended to be more sensitive to the surface water drainage rate qflx h2osfc surfrate soil water potential at full stomatal opening smpso and fff subsurface in 2018 and 2019 under the 4 50 c warming treatment fig 6b to further analyze responses of wt and ch4 fluxes to warming and eco2 with simulation duration the experimental and control simulations were set up with the same climate forcing of 2015 data increases in ch4 fluxes were associated with the decreases in wt under warming whereas under eco2 ch4 fluxes were also enhanced with the increase of wt fig 7 the wt dropped under warming with a larger decline corresponding with more intense warming additionally the warming effects on water table level weakened over time and the water table levels under most of warming levels even started increasing beginning in the third warming year fig 7a accordingly the increased ch4 emission among the warming treatments became smaller and smaller over time and reached their smallest values at the end of the simulations fig 7b in contrast to the strong warming effects there was a weaker eco2 impact an increase of 7 2 in water table level fig 7a the ch4 emission under eco2 also showed a continuous increase and it intensified over time fig 7b 5 discussion 5 1 model comparison with synthesis and observational results our model simulations are in good agreement with the observational results from the spruce study and a global synthesis fig 8 both spruce observations and model simulations showed that the wt declines were caused by enhanced et under the warming treatments hanson et al 2020 mcpartland et al 2019 norby et al 2019 but such changes did not lead to a substantial reduction in soil moisture due to the high frequency precipitation over the simulation period both field observational data and our simulations showed minor eco2 impacts on et and therefore canopy transpiration and soil moisture simulated runoff declined under both warming and eco2 consistent with the spruce experimental results however there are still inconsistencies between spruce observations and the elm spruce model outputs measured lai had positive responses to both warming and eco2 treatments while our model outputs showed smaller lai changes under warming treatments fig 8 this difference is likely due to the complicated plant community responses to nutrient availability and environmental factors in the first three years community level vegetation carbon gains are attributable to eco2 hanson et al 2020 it should be noted that although sealing of subsurface leaks into the spruce experimental plots was completed in november 2020 there were still few available data to evaluate the effectiveness of sealing efforts on surface runoff despite the occurrence of many observable hydrological responses to date further observation is needed to validate the performance of the elm spruce model for understanding the warming and eco2 impacts on peatland ch4 emission 5 2 controls of thermal and hydrological processes on ch4 flux under warming and eco2 soil biogeochemical processes are jointly controlled by hydrological and thermal regimes waddington et al 2015 bubier et al 1995 we predicted that the wt would drop as a result of warming in peatlands which is consistent with previous studies nykänen et al 1998 turetsky et al 2008 the lower wt affects ch4 production not only by changing anoxic conditions but also by controlling energy transfer to deeper soil profiles turetsky et al 2008 meanwhile less surface runoff reduced lateral flows of heat and nutrients which may result in sporadic areas of higher soil temperature above the water table and thus spatial heterogeneity in ch4 flux nonetheless ch4 flux showed a decreasing tendency under these treatments indicating a diminishing impact of wt on ch4 flux therefore without hydrological feedbacks the response of ch4 flux to climate warming could be overestimated under warming condition more precipitation fell in the form of rain rather than snow figure s3 and more water evaporated furthermore the wt dropped and suppressed the activity of methanogens by expanding the oxic zone reducing ch4 emission gedney et al 2004 nykänen et al 1998 yrjälä et al 2011 on the other hand the expansion of the oxic zone promoted microbial decomposition of organic matter which produced more acetate co2 and other organic substrates for methanogenesis methanogens cannot immediately utilize substrates in oxic conditions and there could be a time lag between the substrate supply and utilization by methanogens overall ch4 production was strengthened primarily by the stimulating effects of warming on methanogens instead of suppression effects of wt drawdown among the hydrological variables canopy transpiration was identified as the key factor that directly caused the drawdown of the wt the emission of ch4 can be underestimated under eco2 if one ignores the hydrological feedbacks because the increased wt was associated with enhanced ch4 emission we found that eco2 enhanced npp and lai figure s1 directly leading to an increase in canopy interception and evaporation meanwhile due to the increased shading from greater plant cover and less throughfall ground evaporation declined furthermore the cooling effect of vegetation cover suppressed canopy transpiration higher surface runoff and infiltration reduced the surface water depth with less snow accumulation given that water loss from plant transpiration greatly decreased under eco2 soil water storage increased and then the wt rose the increased wt intensified the opportunities for soil saturation and anaerobic conditions thereby favoring methanogenesis and suppressing methanotrophy the eco2 impacts on increasing wt in turn strengthened positive feedbacks of eco2 on ch4 production and emission although the magnitude of the hydrological feedbacks under eco2 remains unclear these simulations emphasize the importance of hydrological processes in strengthening understanding of peatland ch4 emissions overall there are strong interactions between hydrology and thermal dynamics bohn et al 2007 and these interactions further feed back to ch4 flux 5 3 implications we established a mechanistic framework for evaluating the indirect effects of warming and eco2 on peatland ch4 production concentration and transport and ultimately provided a mechanistic explanation of hydrological feedbacks that affect ch4 emissions furthermore the finding derived from the elm spruce model of how warming and eco2 impact hydrological processes highlights the importance of including hydrological feedbacks in modeling ch4 cycling the elm spruce model and its application on the peatland ch4 flux under warming and elevated co2 scenarios represent a critical step towards an explicit representation of microbial processes and hydrological processes with lateral transfers between hummock and hollow columns shi et al 2015 the mechanistic understanding of how hydrology affects ch4 cycling under warming and elevated co2 provides insightful information for considering how to manage peatlands under changing climate and rising atmospheric co2 5 4 the way forward we explored how hydrological feedbacks influence ch4 production concentration and transport pathways by using the elm spruce model in addition to key insights we identified a few limitations that will be addressed in our future work first in the field experiment air and soil temperatures were simultaneously warmed by 2 25 c 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c however in the model simulations where horizontal boundaries are infinite only the air temperature was increased by 2 25 c 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c while soil temperature was simulated by the model and was less than the change of air temperature for each warming treatment second more field observations are needed to validate model simulations of lateral and vertical hydrological processes at multiple temporal and spatial scales as well as other in peatlands types fens vs bog third the effects of warming and eco2 on peatland ch4 cycling vary at different temporal scales given the predicted shift in vegetation communities that will likely occur under long term climate change it is necessary to incorporate the dynamics of plant species and community composition in the model for a more accurate estimation for example the coverage of sphagnum mosses is sharply declining with warming in the spruce experiment norby et al 2019 which is currently poorly simulated in elm spruce but may have strong implications for site hydrology and carbon cycling fourth an early start to the growing season in spring with warming was simulated with the elm spruce model which influenced the water balance between water loss via canopy evapotranspiration and input via canopy interception for example changes in phenology have been considered as a critical factor for co2 uptake in wetlands richardson et al 2018 in association with their effects on soil hydrology and ch4 cycling phenology shifts need to be taken into account to improve modeling of hydrology and biogeochemistry warming induced phenology changes may reinforce the impacts of long term warming and eco2 on peatland ch4 cycling several models have accounted for these processes but they might underestimate or overestimate the climatic effects on ch4 fluxes without an explicit representation of microbial functions in ch4 processes koven et al 2015 koven et al 2011 fifth vegetation c allocation is affected by warming and eco2 previous studies indicated that plants allocate more c for root growth to enhance water uptake in dry sites chapin et al 2011 the shoot to root ratio is an important indicator for soil water conditions and it has been well considered in model simulations thus to fully understand the role of hydrological feedbacks in controlling ch4 cycling the process based biogeochemical models need to be improved to explicitly represent vegetation dynamics phenology and plant c allocation lastly peat surface elevation declines potentially as a result of decomposition and drying have been observed hanson et al 2020 and may cause further hydrological feedbacks that are not currently considered in our modeling framework which assumes a fixed surface 6 conclusions this study provides insight on various effects of warming and eco2 on hydrology that feedback to ch4 production transport concentration and emission hydrological feedbacks to warming mitigate the stimulating effects of warming on ch4 emission in contrast hydrological feedbacks to eco2 strengthened the eco2 effects that reinforce ch4 emission from peatlands water table level is the primary control on peatland ch4 dynamics and wt levels dropped along the warming gradient but rose with eco2 model simulations showed that warming induced higher plant transpiration which contributed to water table drawdown our synthesis of previous studies corroborated our interpretation that hydrological feedbacks under warming have numerous mechanistic effects on ch4 fluxes this study showed relatively small uncertainties in the hydrological framework of the elm spruce model the magnitude of warming effects on water table level and ch4 fluxes increased along the warming gradient and decreased over time whereas no such tendency was modelled under eco2 7 data availability the data used in this paper have been archived on

3862,peatland carbon cycling is critical for the land atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases particularly under changing environments warming and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide eco2 concentrations directly enhance peatland methane ch4 emission and indirectly affect ch4 processes by altering hydrological conditions an ecosystem model elm spruce the land model of the e3sm model was used to understand the hydrological feedback mechanisms on ch4 emission in a temperate peatland under a warming gradient and eco2 treatments we found that the water table level was a critical regulator of hydrological feedbacks that affect peatland ch4 dynamics the simulated water table levels dropped as warming intensified but slightly increased under eco2 evaporation and vegetation transpiration determined the water table level in peatland ecosystems although warming significantly stimulated ch4 emission the hydrological feedbacks leading to a reduced water table mitigated the stimulating effects of warming on ch4 emission the hydrological feedback for eco2 effects was weak the comparison between modeled results with data from a field experiment and a global synthesis of observations supports the model simulation of hydrological feedbacks in projecting ch4 flux under warming and eco2 the elm spruce model showed relatively small parameter induced uncertainties on hydrological variables and their impacts on ch4 fluxes a sensitivity analysis confirmed a strong hydrological feedback in the first three years and the feedback diminished after four years of warming hydrology moderated warming impacts on ch4 cycling suggest that the indirect effect of warming on hydrological feedbacks is fundamental for accurately projecting peatland ch4 flux under climate warming keywords warming elevated carbon dioxide hydrology methane model peatland 1 introduction peatlands store 16 33 of the global terrestrial soil carbon bridgham et al 2006 gorham 1991 and play an important role in regulating climate change peatlands act as net sinks of carbon dioxide co2 and net sources of atmospheric methane ch4 due to the prevalence of waterlogged conditions dinsmore et al 2009 harriss et al 1985 huttunen et al 2003 mcnamara et al 2008 therefore water table level wt is a vital parameter controlling peatland ch4 emission dise et al 1993 2011 laine et al 1996 moore and roulet 1993 white et al 2008 any level of climate warming might alter hydrological processes and soil microbial physiology nykänen et al 1998 thereby modifying co2 and ch4 emission and changing c storage in peatlands bridgham et al 1995 keller et al 2004 a rise in the wt might strengthen ch4 emission by stimulating the activities of methanogens nykänen et al 1998 turetsky et al 2008 or reduce ch4 emission by reducing the transport rate of ch4 to the atmosphere blodau and moore 2003 brown et al 2014 knorr et al 2008 a wt drop might promote the oxidation of ch4 and thus reduce ch4 emission zhang et al 2007 warming and elevated co2 eco2 represent two critical global change factors affecting ch4 flux in peatlands xu et al 2010 xu and tian 2012 turetsky et al 2008 updegraff et al 2001 for example warming stimulates peatland ch4 emission by directly enhancing ch4 transport from soil to the atmosphere turetsky et al 2008 in addition warmer temperatures stimulate methanogenesis more than methanotrophy dunfield et al 1993 and thus reinforces ch4 emission elevated eco2 has the potential to enhance ch4 emission by increasing plant biomass thereby providing a c substrate for ch4 production dijkstra et al 2012 hutchin et al 1995 inubushi et al 2003 saarnio et al 1998 however peatlands are complex ecohydrological systems and the hydrological feedbacks linked to the wt can reinforce the climatic impacts on ch4 emission waddington et al 2015 water table dynamics are a function of precipitation evaporation transpiration and drainage near surface runoff or deeper vertical drainage to aquifers a wt drop is expected to increase aerobic c mineralization song et al 2018 which in turn provides more available c substrates for methanogenesis on the contrary a low wt may also suppress peatland ch4 emission due to an expansion of the ch4 oxidation zone associated with aerobic soil and a contraction of the methanogenesis zone associated with anoxic saturated soil whalen and reeburgh 1996 2000 white et al 2008 thus warming affects the wt level via strengthened evapotranspiration reduced soil moisture and altered precipitation regimes allison and treseder 2008 verburg et al 1999 meanwhile the stimulating effects of eco2 on vegetation biomass might lead to increases in water loss via canopy evaporation and transportation and decreases in water input via canopy interception waddington et al 2015 such hydrological changes might interact with warming and eco2 to complicate ch4 cycling represented in peatland ecosystem models large uncertainties exist in projecting the responses of ch4 emission to warming and eco2 in peatland ecosystems bridgham et al 2013 ma et al 2017 due to the unknown mechanisms of ch4 production and emission associated with complicated hydrological feedbacks a shift in microbial community composition associated with vegetation dynamics might occur under long term warming and eco2 which may offset the effects of short term changes in wt level blodau 2002 szumigalski and bayley 1997 tveit et al 2015 in particular changes in plant species composition can affect ecosystem functions weltzin et al 2000 including evapotranspiration and co2 and ch4 fluxes a few biogeochemical models have accounted for wt fluctuation and impacts on ch4 fluxes kettunen 2003 ma et al 2017 segers et al 2001a b c xu et al 2016 however the mechanisms by which soil hydrological processes respond to warming and eco2 and affect peatland ch4 fluxes remain elusive ricciuto et al 2021 this study focuses on the hydrological

implemented in the spruce field experiment within 10 open top enclosures hanson et al 2017 six of these 10 treatments were selected for model simulations using elm spruce 0 c and four warming levels at ambient co2 and 0 c at eco2 within the enclosures hydrology is isolated using a subsurface corral system sebestyen and griffiths 2016 so that the treatments may cause shifts in water table levels without inducing lateral flows from the bog surrounding the enclosures this model was originally developed upon clm4 5 with improved representations of hydrology shi et al 2015 moss shi et al 2021 and ch4 cycling xu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 ricciuto et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 the initial atmospheric forcing data from 2001 to 2014 used in the model were developed by the spruce team ricciuto et al 2021 the model was implemented for three stages including the accelerated spin up thornton and rosenbloom 2005 final spin up and transient runs then six independent experimental simulations from 2015 to 2019 were conducted to examine how ch4 emission responds to warming and eco2 over a 5 year period for a comparison with the field experiment the cumulative changes in modeled variables in response to warming and eco2 were calculated relative to the control treatment unwarmed ambient eco2 responses more information and evaluations of model experiments are available in our previous publications

literature were used to validate model performance experimental data from the spruce project were used to evaluate the site level simulation hanson et al 2020 mcpartland et al 2019 norby et al 2019 the evapotranspiration et warren et al 2021 transpiration leaf area index lai wt runoff sebestyen and griffiths 2016 and soil water content are at the s1 bog measured by the spruce team hanson et al 2020 measurements of runoff or lateral flow are known to have errors during high water periods and therefore were not a clear quantitative measure of warming and eco2 responses nevertheless the observational data of runoff support the warming induced wt drop as simulated by the model additionally published literature was surveyed to generate a global synthesis of warming and eco2 experimental results in peatlands to evaluate the broader applicability of the elm spruce model we executed a keyword search algorithm searching warming or rising temperature or elevated co2 or rising co2 or fumigation co2 or enrichment co2 and ch4 or methane and wetland or peatland or bog or marsh or swamp or fen in the web of science and google scholar databases the latest search was completed in march 2020 published literature was screened and the data were included if they a had exact values or graphs for variables related to ch4 emissions and hydrological processes and b provided detailed information on the wetland type s and treatment setting s eight eco2 studies and five warming studies met these criteria table s1 five variables were chosen and extracted from these relevant publications including et trans lai wt and sw for these selected studies the air temperature increased by 0 85 4 10 c in warming experiments and the atmospheric co2 concentrations were elevated by 120 350 ppm in the eco2 experiments the duration of experiments ranged from 0 13 to 12 years all data from warming experiments were standardized to per c of warming c 1 while the data from eco2 experiments were standardized to per 100 ppm v elevated co2 100 ppm 1 4 results 4 1 canopy hydrological processes as modeled using elm spruce warming and eco2 largely influenced canopy hydrological processes the cumulative effects of eco2 over the 5 year simulation were positive on whole ecosystem canopy interception and transpiration whereas warming effects were negative for canopy evaporation and transpiration fig 1 d f simulated canopy interception evaporation and transpiration showed the same seasonal patterns increasing in spring reaching a maximum in summer and decreasing in fall fig 1a c the warming effects on canopy interception followed the gradient of warming treatments canopy interception increased with warming in the first 3 years of warming primarily driven by earlier leaf out but then decreased fig 1a as driven by the projected decrease in peak lai figure s1 the cumulative responses of canopy interception departure from ambient simulation also intensified rapidly in the first 3 years then weakened after reaching peaks of 16 0 mm 17 7 mm 18 9 mm and 12 0 mm in 2017 under 2 25 c 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c respectively fig 1d even the cumulative effects under 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c tended to diminish after the third warming year on the other hand the cumulative eco2 effects on canopy interception continued increasing over the entire period and eventually reached 9 2 mm fig 1d after 5 years the cumulative effects of simulated warming on canopy evaporation were negative fig 1e due to the declining lai figure s1 and drying soil fig 3d h in contrast warming effects were consistently positive on canopy transpiration fig 1f the magnitude of the cumulative effects increased with warming strength the cumulative warming effects reinforced canopy evaporation in the first two years then started to decrease in the following years the cumulative canopy evaporation changed by 1 6 mm 7 9 mm 17 2 mm and 29 5 mm under the four warming treatments respectively the cumulative canopy transpiration was enhanced by 156 8 mm 228 9 mm 250 7 mm and 188 1 after the 5 year warming period the cumulative 5 year effect of warming on canopy transpiration under 9 00 c reduced from the fourth warming year despite increasing under 2 25 c 4 50 c and 6 75 c and the cumulative magnitude increased with the warming strength in contrast the eco2 treatment cumulatively strengthened the canopy evaporation response and slowly weakened the canopy transpiration response relative to the ambient co2 treatment fig 1e f the cumulative canopy evaporation increased by 16 8 mm whereas cumulative canopy transpiration decreased by 119 9 mm by the end of the fifth year 4 2 surface hydrological processes ground evaporation snow depth surface water depth depth of water table on soil surface and surface lateral runoff varied seasonally over the 5 year simulation period fig 2 a d overall warming cumulatively led to lower while eco2 cumulatively led to higher snow depth surface water depth and surface runoff fig 2f g h both warming and eco2 diminished ground evaporation fig 2e the cumulative effects of warming and eco2 on surface hydrological processes were stronger when the hydrological metrics reached their maximums during spring snowmelt periods all measures of ground level hydrology reached maximums in march due to snow melt and then were drawn down to lower levels throughout the rest of the year lower levels persisted until the next melting season with slight fluctuations depending on the timing of precipitation events hanson et al 2020 the magnitudes of the cumulative effects of warming on three ground hydrological variables evaporation snow depth and surface water table increased with the warming gradient and tended to be comparable under the 6 75 c and 9 00 c treatments especially in the last year of the simulations fig 2e g surface lateral runoff under 9 00 c showed the same magnitude of response as the 6 75 c treatment in the second warming year and then had a smaller cumulative effect than under 6 75 c in the fourth warming year fig 2h the rates of ground evaporation cumulatively decreased by 7 2 mm 20 0 mm 26 3 mm and 23 8 mm along the warming gradient after 5 years while eco2 decreased the ground evaporation rate by 11 1 mm which was similar to the response of ground evaporation under 2 25 c fig 2e warming cumulatively reduced snow depth and displayed a larger suppression effect in the fifth year compared with the first four years especially in the warmest treatment fig 2f at the end of the simulations the cumulative reductions in snow depth when compared to the ambient treatment showed the decreases of 5 7 m 10 6 m 14 6 m and 16 5 m along the warming gradient in contrast the eco2 treatment had a slight positive effect on snow depth and snow depth cumulatively increased only by 0 9 m over five simulation years fig 2f the surface water depth and surface runoff declined under the warming treatments and the cumulative reductions gradually strengthened over time in contrast both surface water depth and runoff cumulatively increased under eco2 furthermore surface water depth was more responsive than the surface runoff to warming and eco2 at the end of the 5 year simulations cumulative surface water depth decreased by 499 0 mm 493 6 mm 491 3 mm and 112 4 mm along the warming gradient and increased by 446 3 mm under eco2 warming cumulatively diminished surface runoff by 49 9 mm 70 4 mm 90 7 mm and 78 5 mm from the 2 25 c to 9 00 c warming treatments respectively whereas eco2 cumulatively enhanced runoff by 7 7 mm at the end of the simulations 4 3 belowground hydrologic and thermal processes water infiltration to deep soils and soil temperature along the soil profile exhibited similar seasonality increasing in warm seasons and decreasing in cold seasons however the total wt level and soil water content showed opposite seasonal dynamics declining with high soil temperature and rising with low soil temperature respectively fig 3 a d overall warming and eco2 had opposite cumulative effects on soil temperature water table level and soil water content but both cumulatively raised soil infiltration after four years and the final effect of eco2 was minimal compared to the effect of 2 25 c warming treatment fig 3e h warming reinforced the soil water infiltration especially under 2 25 c treatments but decreased the water table level and soil water content fig 3a d the cumulative effects on the belowground hydrothermal metrics were intensified along with warming and tended to be comparable over time for the soil water infiltration and water table level under 6 75 c and 9 00 c however eco2 reduced infiltration during the first 4 years while water table level and soil water content increased fig 3e h the cumulative changes in infiltration showed highly seasonal patterns displaying a greater response to warming in warm seasons the rates of the infiltration cumulatively increased by 103 5 mm 147 1 mm 283 0 mm and 305 8 mm along the warming gradient and the rate cumulatively increased by 92 7 mm under eco2 at the end of simulations soil temperature increased more under more intense warming fig 3e after the 5 year simulations warming cumulatively increased the soil temperature by 1263 2 c 2759 8 c 4390 7 c and 5687 2 c under 2 25 c 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c respectively eco2 cumulatively decreased the soil temperature by 107 1 c and the effects of eco2 were considerably very small comparing with the cumulative effects of warming water table level and soil water content generally declined with warming over the simulation period but they showed larger responses to 6 75 c than other warming treatments fig 3g and 3h the cumulative reductions of the water table level diminished in the fifth warming year at the end of 5 years of warming the water table level cumulatively decreased by 20 0 mm 32 3 mm 28 8 mm and 28 3 mm and the soil water content cumulatively decreased by 1 3 3 6 2 6 and 1 4 along the warming gradient meanwhile at the end of the eco2 simulations the soil water content increased by 1 5 and water table level cumulatively rose by 17 4 mm fig 3g and 3h 4 4 a mechanistic framework for hydrological feedbacks on ch4 cycling under warming and eco2 the mechanisms of warming and eco2 impacts on ch4 cycling were distinct due to their differing effects on hydrological processes fig 4 warming suppressed net primary productivity npp and lai figure s1 and therefore diminished canopy evaporative loss mainly via reducing evaporative area conversely warming enhanced canopy interception by increasing interception duration despite decreasing lai the reason is that warming led to an earlier and extended growing season for deciduous tree species table s2 such as tamarack larix laricina and various understory shrubs in the s1 bog thereby suppressing throughfall inputs as a source for surface moisture and ground evaporation canopy transpiration was also intensified by warming due to higher vapor pressure deficiencies in the enclosures in addition rising canopy transpiration dominated the rapid water loss under warming and the enhanced water loss was 6 4 98 times larger than the decreases in ground and canopy evaporation at the end of 5 year simulations additionally warming promoted the melting of snow and ice thereby decreasing snow accumulation with snow melt surface water depth and surface runoff increased following the further enhancement of soil water infiltration with soil freezing surface water depth dropped and then ground evaporation diminished however during the dry summer seasons under warming water table levels surface runoff and soil water content decreased as a result of the rising water uptake by vegetation this drainage of surface peat also created more storage above the water table and allowed for high infiltration when precipitation inputs were adequate to offset transpiration losses lower water table levels inhibited ch4 production by shrinking the anoxic zone for methanogenesis however soil temperature increased due to warming and enhanced ch4 production in the regions that remained anoxic ricciuto et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 the decreased water table level which allowed more oxygen to penetrate into soils and promoted mineralization of soil organic matter som led to an increased production of substrates for methanogenesis ch4 production was stimulated by warmer temperature leading to the consumption of available substrates that resulted in an actual loss of substrate availability warming had little impact on simulated ch4 oxidation yuan et al 2021 but enhanced the transport of ch4 from peat to the atmosphere the soil ch4 concentrations temporarily increased because of stimulated ch4 production but eventually declined due to enhanced transport of ch4 through a combination of plant mediated transport diffusion and ebullition ricciuto et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 overall despite the inhibition of ch4 production via a lower water table the net effect of warming was an increase in ch4 emission because of the enhancement of methanogenesis and ch4 transport ch4 emission was reinforced in the eco2 treatment but the hydrological feedback to eco2 showed different effects on ch4 dynamics fig 4 the npp increase under eco2 resulted in a rise in canopy interception and a decline in ground evaporation canopy evaporation increased with greater canopy interception whereas canopy transpiration was suppressed under eco2 overall water loss from soils decreased due to the decrease in the canopy transpiration under eco2 additionally due to the increasing canopy shade under higher leaf area stimulated by eco2 soil temperature and ground evaporation decreased which led to higher snow depth and increased surface runoff when snow melted the higher water table level and soil water content facilitated methanogenesis meanwhile increased npp stimulated substrate supply and higher som mineralization strengthened ch4 production more ch4 was produced by methanogens which led to higher ch4 concentrations in soils intensified by the trivial changes in ch4 oxidation yuan et al 2021 overall the hydrological feedback to eco2 resulted in positive feedback on ch4 emission 4 5 uncertainty analysis the hydrological parameter induced uncertainties in hydrological processes are relatively small when compared to the uncertainties in ecosystem carbon processes from biogeochemical parameters in the current elm spruce model yuan et al 2021 among the main hydrological and ch4 processes under different warming and eco2 levels the prediction intervals of canopy transpiration canopy evaporation ground evaporation and ch4 fluxes showed narrower and less seasonal variation than wt fig 5 a e this suggested that a relatively high uncertainty existed in wt simulations due to the choices of hydrological parameters and there may be seasonal differences in the determination of hydrological parameters for simulating wt under different warming levels and eco2 we did not find large differences in uncertainty intervals of hydrological and ch4 processes caused by hydrological parameters however the uncertainties from hydrological parameters increased with the simulation duration particularly for the wt level and ch4 fluxes fig 5f j and figure s2 4 6 sensitivity analysis the hydrological feedbacks regulating water table level and ch4 fluxes showed substantially different patterns among the six treatments during the 5 year simulations fig 6 no consistency was observed in the sensitivities of wt and net ch4 fluxes to each hydrological parameter for example the fff subsurface i e the decay factor for surface runoff seemed to be a stronger factor controlling the water table level in the control 2 25 c and 4 50 c treatments fig 6a while the ch4 fluxes tended to be more sensitive to the surface water drainage rate qflx h2osfc surfrate soil water potential at full stomatal opening smpso and fff subsurface in 2018 and 2019 under the 4 50 c warming treatment fig 6b to further analyze responses of wt and ch4 fluxes to warming and eco2 with simulation duration the experimental and control simulations were set up with the same climate forcing of 2015 data increases in ch4 fluxes were associated with the decreases in wt under warming whereas under eco2 ch4 fluxes were also enhanced with the increase of wt fig 7 the wt dropped under warming with a larger decline corresponding with more intense warming additionally the warming effects on water table level weakened over time and the water table levels under most of warming levels even started increasing beginning in the third warming year fig 7a accordingly the increased ch4 emission among the warming treatments became smaller and smaller over time and reached their smallest values at the end of the simulations fig 7b in contrast to the strong warming effects there was a weaker eco2 impact an increase of 7 2 in water table level fig 7a the ch4 emission under eco2 also showed a continuous increase and it intensified over time fig 7b 5 discussion 5 1 model comparison with synthesis and observational results our model simulations are in good agreement with the observational results from the spruce study and a global synthesis fig 8 both spruce observations and model simulations showed that the wt declines were caused by enhanced et under the warming treatments hanson et al 2020 mcpartland et al 2019 norby et al 2019 but such changes did not lead to a substantial reduction in soil moisture due to the high frequency precipitation over the simulation period both field observational data and our simulations showed minor eco2 impacts on et and therefore canopy transpiration and soil moisture simulated runoff declined under both warming and eco2 consistent with the spruce experimental results however there are still inconsistencies between spruce observations and the elm spruce model outputs measured lai had positive responses to both warming and eco2 treatments while our model outputs showed smaller lai changes under warming treatments fig 8 this difference is likely due to the complicated plant community responses to nutrient availability and environmental factors in the first three years community level vegetation carbon gains are attributable to eco2 hanson et al 2020 it should be noted that although sealing of subsurface leaks into the spruce experimental plots was completed in november 2020 there were still few available data to evaluate the effectiveness of sealing efforts on surface runoff despite the occurrence of many observable hydrological responses to date further observation is needed to validate the performance of the elm spruce model for understanding the warming and eco2 impacts on peatland ch4 emission 5 2 controls of thermal and hydrological processes on ch4 flux under warming and eco2 soil biogeochemical processes are jointly controlled by hydrological and thermal regimes waddington et al 2015 bubier et al 1995 we predicted that the wt would drop as a result of warming in peatlands which is consistent with previous studies nykänen et al 1998 turetsky et al 2008 the lower wt affects ch4 production not only by changing anoxic conditions but also by controlling energy transfer to deeper soil profiles turetsky et al 2008 meanwhile less surface runoff reduced lateral flows of heat and nutrients which may result in sporadic areas of higher soil temperature above the water table and thus spatial heterogeneity in ch4 flux nonetheless ch4 flux showed a decreasing tendency under these treatments indicating a diminishing impact of wt on ch4 flux therefore without hydrological feedbacks the response of ch4 flux to climate warming could be overestimated under warming condition more precipitation fell in the form of rain rather than snow figure s3 and more water evaporated furthermore the wt dropped and suppressed the activity of methanogens by expanding the oxic zone reducing ch4 emission gedney et al 2004 nykänen et al 1998 yrjälä et al 2011 on the other hand the expansion of the oxic zone promoted microbial decomposition of organic matter which produced more acetate co2 and other organic substrates for methanogenesis methanogens cannot immediately utilize substrates in oxic conditions and there could be a time lag between the substrate supply and utilization by methanogens overall ch4 production was strengthened primarily by the stimulating effects of warming on methanogens instead of suppression effects of wt drawdown among the hydrological variables canopy transpiration was identified as the key factor that directly caused the drawdown of the wt the emission of ch4 can be underestimated under eco2 if one ignores the hydrological feedbacks because the increased wt was associated with enhanced ch4 emission we found that eco2 enhanced npp and lai figure s1 directly leading to an increase in canopy interception and evaporation meanwhile due to the increased shading from greater plant cover and less throughfall ground evaporation declined furthermore the cooling effect of vegetation cover suppressed canopy transpiration higher surface runoff and infiltration reduced the surface water depth with less snow accumulation given that water loss from plant transpiration greatly decreased under eco2 soil water storage increased and then the wt rose the increased wt intensified the opportunities for soil saturation and anaerobic conditions thereby favoring methanogenesis and suppressing methanotrophy the eco2 impacts on increasing wt in turn strengthened positive feedbacks of eco2 on ch4 production and emission although the magnitude of the hydrological feedbacks under eco2 remains unclear these simulations emphasize the importance of hydrological processes in strengthening understanding of peatland ch4 emissions overall there are strong interactions between hydrology and thermal dynamics bohn et al 2007 and these interactions further feed back to ch4 flux 5 3 implications we established a mechanistic framework for evaluating the indirect effects of warming and eco2 on peatland ch4 production concentration and transport and ultimately provided a mechanistic explanation of hydrological feedbacks that affect ch4 emissions furthermore the finding derived from the elm spruce model of how warming and eco2 impact hydrological processes highlights the importance of including hydrological feedbacks in modeling ch4 cycling the elm spruce model and its application on the peatland ch4 flux under warming and elevated co2 scenarios represent a critical step towards an explicit representation of microbial processes and hydrological processes with lateral transfers between hummock and hollow columns shi et al 2015 the mechanistic understanding of how hydrology affects ch4 cycling under warming and elevated co2 provides insightful information for considering how to manage peatlands under changing climate and rising atmospheric co2 5 4 the way forward we explored how hydrological feedbacks influence ch4 production concentration and transport pathways by using the elm spruce model in addition to key insights we identified a few limitations that will be addressed in our future work first in the field experiment air and soil temperatures were simultaneously warmed by 2 25 c 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c however in the model simulations where horizontal boundaries are infinite only the air temperature was increased by 2 25 c 4 50 c 6 75 c and 9 00 c while soil temperature was simulated by the model and was less than the change of air temperature for each warming treatment second more field observations are needed to validate model simulations of lateral and vertical hydrological processes at multiple temporal and spatial scales as well as other in peatlands types fens vs bog third the effects of warming and eco2 on peatland ch4 cycling vary at different temporal scales given the predicted shift in vegetation communities that will likely occur under long term climate change it is necessary to incorporate the dynamics of plant species and community composition in the model for a more accurate estimation for example the coverage of sphagnum mosses is sharply declining with warming in the spruce experiment norby et al 2019 which is currently poorly simulated in elm spruce but may have strong implications for site hydrology and carbon cycling fourth an early start to the growing season in spring with warming was simulated with the elm spruce model which influenced the water balance between water loss via canopy evapotranspiration and input via canopy interception for example changes in phenology have been considered as a critical factor for co2 uptake in wetlands richardson et al 2018 in association with their effects on soil hydrology and ch4 cycling phenology shifts need to be taken into account to improve modeling of hydrology and biogeochemistry warming induced phenology changes may reinforce the impacts of long term warming and eco2 on peatland ch4 cycling several models have accounted for these processes but they might underestimate or overestimate the climatic effects on ch4 fluxes without an explicit representation of microbial functions in ch4 processes koven et al 2015 koven et al 2011 fifth vegetation c allocation is affected by warming and eco2 previous studies indicated that plants allocate more c for root growth to enhance water uptake in dry sites chapin et al 2011 the shoot to root ratio is an important indicator for soil water conditions and it has been well considered in model simulations thus to fully understand the role of hydrological feedbacks in controlling ch4 cycling the process based biogeochemical models need to be improved to explicitly represent vegetation dynamics phenology and plant c allocation lastly peat surface elevation declines potentially as a result of decomposition and drying have been observed hanson et al 2020 and may cause further hydrological feedbacks that are not currently considered in our modeling framework which assumes a fixed surface 6 conclusions this study provides insight on various effects of warming and eco2 on hydrology that feedback to ch4 production transport concentration and emission hydrological feedbacks to warming mitigate the stimulating effects of warming on ch4 emission in contrast hydrological feedbacks to eco2 strengthened the eco2 effects that reinforce ch4 emission from peatlands water table level is the primary control on peatland ch4 dynamics and wt levels dropped along the warming gradient but rose with eco2 model simulations showed that warming induced higher plant transpiration which contributed to water table drawdown our synthesis of previous studies corroborated our interpretation that hydrological feedbacks under warming have numerous mechanistic effects on ch4 fluxes this study showed relatively small uncertainties in the hydrological framework of the elm spruce model the magnitude of warming effects on water table level and ch4 fluxes increased along the warming gradient and decreased over time whereas no such tendency was modelled under eco2 7 data availability the data used in this paper have been archived on

3863,hurricanes are the major flood generating mechanism dominating the upper tail of the peak discharge distribution over the cape fear river basin cfrb in 2018 hurricane florence swamped cfrb as the ninth most destructive hurricane ever hit the united states and set new records of peak discharges over the main river channel and three out of five of its major tributaries in this study we examined the hydrometeorology and hydrology of this flood via combined observation and numerical experiment analyses our results suggest that the slow motion in combination to the l shaped path was the most distinctive feature of the hurricane that incurred catastrophic and widespread rainfall and flooding over cfrb the total rainfall from the storm played a controlling role in the magnitude and spatial distribution of the flood peaks at basin scale above that the spatial heterogeneities of rainfall distribution and hydrologic characteristics was responsible for the distinctive flood responses within the basin the bi peak shape of the flood hydrograph for the deep river was due to the combined effects of rainfall distribution land cover and topographic gradient the exceptional unit peak discharge over the black river basin was associated with its drainage network structure topographic gradient and rainfall distribution the floodplain downstream of the cape fear river temporarily stored flood water and attenuated both the riverine floods from upstream and the compound flood over the coastal area furthermore numerical analyses found that re infiltration accounted for 76 of the total

with a summary and conclusions in section 5 2 study region and methodology 2 1 cape fear river basin as the largest river basin contained entirely within the borders of north carolina cfrb has a drainage area of 23 889 km2 inside the basin the elevation ranges from 364 m in the headwater region to nearly 0 m over the coastal plain area the cfrb contains five major sub basins fig 2 b which are the haw river and the deep river basin upstream the little river basin in the middle and the northeast cape fear river and black river basin downstream the haw river and deep river basin contains two usgs huc 8 units huc 03030002 and huc 03030003 fig 2d and features a rolling and hilly landscape the little river basin is within the middle cfrb huc 03030003 and is characterized by rolling terrain with little relief the lower cfrb is composed of 3 usgs huc 8 units huc 03030005 07 fig 2d and is drained by the main stem of cape fear river black river and northeast cape fear river from west to east respectively the topography in the lower part of cfrb is characterized by low elevation and minimum topographic gradient from 1996 to 2018 13 hurricanes have made landfalls in the basin or passed by within 120 km from it six hurricanes have caused significant flood damages gori et al 2020 a recent study suggests a regime shift in coastal north carolina towards increasingly high precipitation associated with tropical cyclones paerl et al 2019 in addition cfrb is the most industrialized watershed in north carolina with large industries and dozens of big cities sitting within its boundaries the cfrb involves intensive water management activities there are around 1 100 impoundments with dams spread over the basin the majority of which are in the upper part curtis weaver et al 2001 among them the b everett jordan lake jordan lake hereafter fig 2b is the largest surface area impoundment covering an area of 56 4 km2 located 7 km upstream of the mouth of the haw river jordan lake dam is able to retain the runoff from the drainage area from a six inch rainfall n c department of environmental quality division of water resources 2016 along the deep river and the mainstream of cape fear river there is also a series of small dams those dams are typically operated on the basis of run of river mode in which outflows from them are almost equal to inflows weaver and carolina 1997 according to the 21 category modified international geosphere biosphere programme igbp moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis land cover product there are 16 types of land cover over the cfrb the dominant land use types are cropland natural vegetation mosaic 32 mixed forests 20 deciduous broadleaf forest 18 besides that croplands and urban built up account for 6 8 and 3 5 over the whole basin respectively the soil types are mainly sandy loam 33 6 loamy sand 24 2 sand 22 1 silt loam 11 9 and loam 7 1 according to the state soil geographic database miller and white 1998 2 2 methodology our analysis was performed based on both observation and numerical simulation observation data used are detailed in table 2 and table 3 which include three qpe products rain gage observations streamflow observations and annual peak discharges numerical simulations were conducted using wrf hydro gochis et al 2020 which is detailed in section 4 4 it should be noted that the qpe products were evaluated against the rain gage observations prior to formal analysis a point to grid rain gage to qpe comparison over storm total rainfall and hourly rainfall intensity following previous studies cánovas garcía et al 2018 thiemig et al 2012 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 was carried out here storm total rainfall refers to the accumulated precipitation from 0000 utc 14 to 0000 utc 18 september 2018 the modified kling gupta efficiency kge eq 1 gupta et al 2009 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 was calculated to quantitatively measure the overall agreement between estimates and rain gage observations the calculation of kge eq 1 involves three independent components pearson correlation coefficient γ eq 2 relative bias α eq 3 and variability term β eq 4 which can be used to assess the skill of qpes in reproducing the temporal variation average intensity and distribution of the observed rainfall respectively the optimal value of kge is 1 with a higher value indicating better performance γ ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 representing the absence of linear correlation between estimation and observation α 1 implies an overall overestimation while α 1 represents underestimation

rainfall estimation from qpe products and rain gage observation respectively μ estimation and μ obs are the mean values of rainfall estimation and observation σ estimation and σ obs stand for the standard deviations of estimation and observation respectively 3 hydrometeorological analysis of florence 3 1 qpe evaluation table 4 and fig 3 summarize the performance of the three qpe products in reproducing the storm total rainfall mm and hourly rainfall intensity mm h during florence all three qpes can satisfactorily capture the storm total rainfall with kge larger than 0 7 stage iv appears to be the best product with the highest kge 0 82 and closest to one β and γ besides all three qpes underestimated the storm total rainfall with α less than 1 as shown in fig 3a a consistent underestimation is observed over stage iv reproduced rainfall while mrms and nldas v2 both overestimate low values 220 mm and underestimate high ones 220 mm similarly the qpes all tend to be able to provide reasonable hourly rainfall intensity with satisfactory kge values larger than 0 7 here stage iv and mrms present comparable skills with kge 0 77 and 0 76 respectively which are better than nldas v2 0 71 while stage iv shows better performance in capturing the temporal variation of rainfall intensity with a higher γ 0 85 value than that of mrms 0 80 the latter α 0 96 is superior to the former α 0 88 in reproducing the average rainfall intensity based on the evaluation we consider stage iv as the best qpe product for reproducing the rainfall over cfrb during florence the following precipitation analysis and numerical simulation are thus based on stage iv 3 2 precipitation analysis florence made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near wrightsville beach north carolina around 1115 utc 14 september 2018 fig 4 a it then moved towards the southwest along the coastal area and degraded into a tropical storm by 0000 utc 15 september another 12 h later the system turned westward and moved slowly across south carolina for an additional 24 h by 1800 utc 16 september it degraded into a tropical depression from then on the storm accelerated towards the north and became extratropical by 1200 utc on 17 september finally it dissipated around 1800 utc the next day florence was a slow moving system prior to and immediately after landfall the forward speed ranged from 3 6 14 4 km h during 14 16 september kunkel and champion 2019 this sluggish speed led to torrential rainfall accumulation over the lower cfrb in addition florence followed a unique track as shown in fig 4a major hurricanes impacting cfrb such as fran 1996 floyd 1999 and matthew 2016 followed a relatively constant direction before and after passing over cfrb by contrast florence showed an l shaped path as it tracked along the path its rainbands extended into different parts of cfrb from the coastal plain to the headwater area as discussed right below and summarized in table s1 the combination of the slow storm motion and the unique track was the distinctive hydrometeorological feature of florence that contributed to the widespread flood response over the entire cfrb fig 4b compares the storm total rainfall associated with the four most disastrous hurricanes impacting cfre the storm total rainfall induced by florence is the highest among all four major hurricanes over not only the major basin but also each sub basin this tremendous amount of rainfall laid the foundation for the widespread and extreme flood with which other hurricane events cannot compete in addition with stage iv qpe and rain gage observations we present the spatiotemporal evolution of the rainfall distribution and its influence on rainfall intensity across the basin following the method of jiang et al 2013 the rainfall fields associated with florence at different stages were categorized into the inner core region the inner rainband region and the outer rainband region the inner core region includes eyewalls when the storm has a discernible eye immediately adjacent to inner core region is the inner rainband which extends outward for about 100 km the outer rainband locates approximately 150 200 km from the center of the storm and extends to the farthest rainfall element the rainband of florence approached cfrb around 0000 utc on 14 september fig 5 a as a result of its path precipitation was initially measured by a rain gage over the lower part of cfrb fig 6 b florence was a category 2 hurricane by that time the eye of which was approximately 100 km from the land the inner core and inner rainband were well developed and were mainly located over the right front quadrant this rainband distribution resulted in an asymmetric rainfall structure eight hours later a thin inner rainband reached the downstream part of the lower cfrb fig 5b this rainband was responsible for the first pulse of heavy rainfall rainfall rate greater than 10 mm h fig 6a at 1100 utc 14 september florence made landfall fig 5c and started cresting across the lower cfrb meanwhile the rain area of florence broadened the inner core and inner rainband controlled the rainfall over the lower cfrb until 1500 utc 14 september when the inner core moved out of cfrb fig 5d marking the end of the first pulse of rainfall fig 6a b since then inner and outer rainbands took over as the major rainfall agent for the lower cfrb by 0900 utc 15 september the largest rainfall rate from the storm occurred due to strong convection from an inner rainband that extended along the mainstem of the cape fear river see fig 5e maximum rainfall rates observed at usgs gage 02105769 fig 6a and coop hpd v2 gage usc00311881 fig 6b were 33 3 mm h and 43 7 mm h respectively florence degraded into a tropical storm fig 5g and lost its distinguishable rainfall structure at 1800 utc 16 september afterward the system accelerated northward and the lower cfrb became out of reach from the rainbands after which little rainfall was observed thus the period of rainfall was mainly from 0000 utc 14 to 18 000 utc 16 september for 67 h over the lower cfrb during this period 88 of 500 mm storm total rainfall over the reach between tarheel 02105500 and kelly 02105769 along the cape fear river was dumped 85 and 95 of the 411 mm and 512 mm storm total rainfall over the black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 and northeast cape fear river basin above chinquapin 02108000 were accumulated respectively over the middle cfrb where the little river basin resides the first pulse of rainfall fig 6c 6d commenced as an outer rainband arrived at 1500 utc 14 september fig 5d from then on till 0800 utc 17 september fig 5h rainfall over this area was controlled by the outer rainband of florence following the movement of the storm the middle cfrb fell in or out of the coverage of the rainband consequently five pulses of rainfall were observed at the rain gages fig 6c d during this 66 hour rainfall window 97 of 269 mm storm total rainfall over the little river above manchester 02103000 was accumulated mean rainfall intensities were 4 0 mm h at usgs 02102908 and 4 5 mm h at usc00313017 respectively and the maximum rainfall intensities were 25 1 mm h and 34 5 mm h respectively which only lasted for one hour during the last pulse two pulses of rainfall were observed over the upper part of the basin fig 6e f the first one started from 1800 utc 14 september and lasted for 48 h until the degradation of florence into tropical depression fig 5g during this period rainfall was light to moderate the accumulative rainfall over haw river basin above bynum 02096960 and deep river basin above moncure 02102000 were 29 mm and 86 mm respectively mean rainfall rates were 1 8 mm h and 0 6 mm h and maximum rainfall rates 8 1 mm h and 5 6 mm h at usgs gage 02098197 fig 6e and 02096500 fig 6f respectively following the first pulse of rainfall the outer rainband associated with the hurricane remnant passed over and induced rainfall for another 20 h till 1300 utc 17 september fig 5j the second pulse of rainfall was much heavier than the first one the accumulated rainfall over the haw river basin above bynum 02096960 and the deep river basin above moncure 02102000 during this period were 89 mm and 137 mm respectively the mean rainfall rates observed at usgs gage 02098197 fig 6e and 02096500 fig 6f were 5 8 mm h and 4 6 mm h respectively the largest rainfall rate during this period occurred at 1000 utc on 17 september fig 5i due to the intensive convection over a remnant rainband usgs gage 02098197 fig 6e and 02096500 fig 6f observed maximum rainfall rates of 37 3 mm h and 22 4 mm h respectively 4 flood hydrology in this section we analyze the flood hydrology associated with florence based on rainfall and streamflow observations table 5 summarizes the flood response to florence in terms of unit peak discharge runoff depth runoff to rainfall ratio lag time and runoff volume to peak discharge ratio vp ratio hereafter unit peak discharge was observed peak discharge divided by the drainage area unit peak discharge and vp ratio can both be used to characterize flood response the unit peak discharge is influenced by rainfall forcing and land surface characteristics lower values can be the result of either lower rainfall input or flood attenuation related to basin characteristics or both by contrast the vp ratio reflects mainly the influence of basin features on flood response it can be used to quantify the relative magnitude of peak discharge and total runoff volume smaller values imply higher peak discharge tendency and quicker response of the basin runoff depth was computed by integrating observed discharge over the period of 0000 utc 14 september to 0000 utc 12 october 2018 and dividing it by drainage area basin averaged storm total rainfall was calculated from stage iv qpe for the period of 0000 utc 14 september to 0000 utc 18 september lag time refers to the difference between the time of peak discharge and that at which 50 of the total rainfall occurs smith et al 2000 note that for gages downstream of jordan lake dam along the main stem of the cape fear river the released discharge from the dam was subtracted from the observation to exclude its effect on flood response 4 1 storm total rainfall over sub river basins storm total rainfall was the predominant control of runoff depth over the major sub basins as is shown in table 5 the runoff to rainfall ratio decreases from the haw river and deep river basins in the hilly upper cfrb to the little river basin in the middle and the black river and northeast cape fear river basins over the coastal region the highest and lowest runoff to rainfall ratio are found in haw river at bynum 02096960 and northeast cape fear river at chinquapin 02108000 respectively on the contrary runoff depth increases from upstream to downstream over the sub river basins indicating the dominance of the storm total rainfall over the hydrologic characteristics in runoff production in the sub basins along the main stem of the cape fear river runoff was preferentially generated over the high elevation upstream area and low elevation coastal regions from moncure 02102000 at the deep river to lillington 02102500 at the mainstem both runoff depth and runoff to rainfall ratio decrease the decreasing trend is carried on further downstream to tar heel 02105500 then further downstream from tar heel 02105500 to kelly 02105769 runoff depth and runoff to rainfall ratio increase again this trend of runoff coefficient points out the higher flooding potential over the upper and lower cfrb than that in the middle part as is shown in table 5 the runoff to rainfall ratios over the reach from moncure 02102000 to lillington 02102500 and from lillington 02102500 to tar heel 02105500 are 0 44 and 0 54 respectively in sharp contrast the ratio reaches 1 for the drainage area from tar heel 02105500 to kelly 02105769 in addition the vp ratios are generally lower over the sub river basins in the upper cfrb table 5 however the unit peak discharges tend to follow the trend of storm total rainfall being higher in lower cfrb this implies the dominance of storm total rainfall in controlling the peak discharge amplitude in the sub river basins further storm total rainfall instead of peak rainfall rates was the major controller of the peak discharge distribution during florence fig 7 compares the time series of basin averaged rainfall intensity with that of the streamflow despite the multi peak signature of the hyetographs the flood hydrographs are characterized by one major peak after or right before the end of rainfall this implies that rainfall intensity played a minimal role in influencing the peak response compared to storm total rainfall during florence 4 2 land cover topographic gradient and flood plain storage in this part the timing signature of flood response is analyzed with lag time and vp ratio as shown in table 5 the lag times of the sub basins over the lower and middle cfrb are two times larger than those of the haw river and deep river basin in the upper part this difference is attributable to the decrease of the topographic gradient from hilly upstream to the flat coastal region in cfrb in correspondence the vp ratio follows a similar trend with an exception found at moncure 02102000 over deep river the lag time at moncure 02102000 is shorter than that at bynum 02096960 table 5 which indicates the faster response of the deep river basin than the haw river basin to rainfall forcing during florence however the vp ratio of the former is 68 higher than that of the latter falling in the same magnitude with the basins downstream this inconsistency and abnormal larger vp ratio at moncure 02102000 is related to the bi peak shape of the flood hydrograph fig 8 a fig 8a shows the nested flood hydrograph for gages along the deep river the initial rise of the flood hydrograph at moncure 02102000 is attributable to the first pulse of rainfall as mentioned in section 3 and shown in fig 7b the major peak is mainly due to the downstream advection from ramseur 02100500 and siler city 02101726 to moncure meanwhile the second peak is caused primarily by the advection from runoff produced over the intervening drainage area between ramseur 02100500 and moncure 02102000 as shown in fig 8b rainfall mainly accumulated over the southwest part of deep river basin during florence here the land cover is mainly forest fig 8c and topographic gradient is low compared to that of ramseur 02100500 and siler city 02101726 in upstream fig 8d thus the velocity of both overland flow and channel flow should be much slower than upstream due to the low topographic gradient and the attenuation effect of forest as a result the flood wave contributed by this southwest part of the basin should arrive at the deep river mouth moncure 02102000 later than that from the upstream area resulting in the bi peak shape of the flood hydrograph it is thus reasonable to argue that this bi peak signature of the flood hydrograph due to the combined effect of rainfall distribution and spatial heterogeneity of land cover and topography should have decreased the amplitude of the flood but increased the duration of it fig 9 a shows the nested flood hydrograph from moncure 02102000 at the deep river to kelly 02105769 downstream of the cape fear river the timing difference in the initial rise of the flood hydrograph suggests the control of storm motion from downstream to upstream on flood response moreover the similarity between flood hydrographs at moncure 02102000 and lillington 02102500 gives the idea that the bulk of the flood at the latter was contributed by deep river further downstream the bi peak feature disappeared and merged into one at tar heel 02105500 with a significant difference found between flood hydrographs at tar heel 02105500 and lillington 02102500 this indicates the contribution of the middle cfrb to the cape fear river flood downstream along the mainstem of the cape fear river from lillington 02102500 to kelly 02105769 the unit peak discharges decrease with the increasing vp ratios table 5 this decrease in peak discharge is due to the flood plain attenuation effect a 13 peak discharge attenuation and a 35 h delay of peak timing are observed between tar heel 02105500 and kelly 02105769 this can be attributed to the floodplain storage effect to analyze this the net discharge hydrograph was derived by subtracting the observed streamflow at tar heel 02105500 from that at kelly 02105769 as shown in fig 9b during 2000 utc 14 to 0400 utc 21 september a total volume of 177 million m3 streamflow from upstream was stored in the flood plain between tar heel 02105500 and kelly 02105769 this storage not only has attenuated the riverine flood from upstream but also has lessened the compound flooding downstream around the cape fear river estuary area considering that the volume of the cape fear river estuary is 253 million m3 ensign et al 2004 the water stored in the flood plain could have flushed out at least 70 of the water in the terminal estuary fig 9c shows the observed total water level and its low passed filtered component with a cutting off frequency of 40 hour using a butterworth filter method the filtered water level represents the component induced by storm surge and riverine input the storm surge induced water level peaked around 0430 utc september 15 at 3 44 m above the mean sea level after that the surge retreated later as the river input increased its impact on the low frequency water level became dominant starting from 0400 utc september 19 the filtered water level tended to increase again and peaked at 3 44 m around 0142 utc september 23 however if there was no timing delay associated with the downstream flood plain we could expect that the riverine freshwater could have entered the cape fear river estuary days earlier with a larger flood peak this more significant riverine input could interact with a then higher storm surge to make the compound flooding more devastating in other words the downstream flood plain has acted as a buffer between upstream riverine flood and downstream storm surge which largely attenuated both the riverine flood from upstream but also the compound flooding in the coastal area 4 3 drainage network soil type and rainfall distribution as is shown in fig 1b five of the top ten largest unit peak discharges are associated with florence among them the maximum is found over the black river at tomahawk 02106500 with a value of 0 89 m3 s 1 km 2 table 5 it is 19 larger than the second maximum 0 75 m3 s 1 km 2 at 02108000 table 5 and 35 larger than the previous record set by fran in 1996 to investigate the exceptional nature of this peak discharge we put it on the envelope cure developed for the coastal regions below the fall line in south carolina georgia and north carolina by feaster et al 2009 as is shown in fig 10 the unit peak discharge over the black river at tomahawk 02106500 is just below the envelope curve but well above the vast majority of data points of similar basin sizes here we investigate the controller of the exceptional unit discharge by comparing it with that of the second maximum at the ne cape fear river basin at chinquapin 02108000 it should be noted from table 5 that both storm total rainfall and runoff depth over chinquapin 02108000 are higher than that over tomahawk 02106500 whereas the drainage area gaged by the former 1551 km2 is smaller than that by the latter 1751 km2 this means that the larger unit peak discharge at tomahawk 02106500 was achieved with less runoff and rainfall over a larger drainage area than that at chinquapin 02108000 in addition the lag time at chinquapin 02108000 is 13 h shorter than that at tomahawk 02106500 moreover the runoff to rainfall ratio is 0 78 at tomahawk 02106500 which is 10 higher than that at chinquapin 02108000 we attribute the distinct flood response between the two to their differences in rainfall distribution soil type and drainage network fig 11 a shows the distribution of the storm total rainfall over the two basins during florence for the black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 large portions of rainfall accumulated over the east and northeast part of it there the soil type is mainly loamy sand as shown in fig 11c meanwhile over the ne cape fear river basin above chinquapin 02108000 most of the rainfall was dumped along the east half of the drainage area the soil type there is primarily sand as the water storage and hydraulic conductivity of sand are higher than that of loamy sand a larger amount of water loss to the former should be expected than that to the latter this difference in water loss can partly explain difference in rainfall to runoff ratio of the two basins the difference between the two neighboring basins in timing and magnitude of peak discharge is tied to the spatial distribution of rainfall relative to the drainage network it can be observed from fig 11a that a considerable portion of rainfall in the black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 dropped over the headwater area with lower channel order larger channel roughness and longer distance to the outlet on the contrary the majority amount of rainfall accumulated near the outlet of the northeast cape fear river basin above chinquapin 02108000 where the stream order channel roughness is high small in this case a faster peak discharge response to rainfall should be expected at chinquapin 02108000 than that at tomahawk 02106500 meanwhile as it can be observed from fig 11b the width of the channel over the most downstream part of the northeast cape fear river basin above chinquapin 02108000 is much larger than in the black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 moreover the topography of the former is flatter than the latter the larger channel width in combination with low topographic gradient is thus the notable feature that explains the smaller peak discharge at chinquapin 02108000 than that at tomahawk 02106500 4 4 re infiltration process re infiltration refers to the infiltration of overland flow as it moves downslope towards the channel which is also known as the run on effect corradini et al 2002 1998 nahar et al 2004 whereas local infiltration is defined as the amount of water infiltrating into the soil locally from the rainfall compared to the latter re infiltration normally acts as a secondary process however during storm events re infiltration can account for more than 50 of total infiltration zhang et al 2020 in addition the re infiltration process can significantly decrease the discharge during both rising and falling limbs corradini et al 1998 in this section we quantify the magnitude of the re infiltration amount and its effect on streamflow during florence using wrf hydro built upon the noah land surface model with multi parameterization options noah mp niu et al 2011 wrf hydro enhances the physical realism of the water cycle by integrating subsurface and overland flow routing base flow and channel routing via corresponding modules among those improvements the lateral overland routing allows for the consideration of re infiltration in the model in this study a calibrated wrf hydro model over the cfrb during florence was applied the computational domain has a dimension of 2490 west to east 3490 north to south with a 100 m horizontal resolution fig 2b which is 10 times finer than that of noah mp the timestep of noah mp is one hour while that of overland and channel routing is 10 s the precipitation forcing was regridded from the stage iv multi sensor rainfall estimation product other forcing variables including air temperature wind short and longwave radiation humidity and pressure were from phase 2 of the north american land data assimilation system mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 following zhang et al 2020 we calculated the total infiltration local infiltration and re infiltration according to the water balance equation eq 5 here the water storage change refers to the variation of subsurface water two numerical experiments were conducted in the first experiment exp1 lateral routing of surface runoff and the accompanied re infiltration were simulated in the second experiment exp2 while the lateral movement of the surface was modeled as well the re infiltration process during the routing was not simulated total infiltration can be calculated as the difference between precipitation input p eq 5 and the surface runoff runoff eq 5 which is equal to the sum of simulated water storage change dels eq 5 and evapotranspiration et eq 5 in exp1 here we ignored the amount of surface water that accumulated in the lakes which were not considered in the model in the same way local infiltration was derived by subtracting the simulated runoff runoff in exp2 from the precipitation p then the re infiltration was calculated by subtracting local infiltration from total infiltration 5 p e t r u n o f f d e l s table 6 summarizes the simulated water budget with exp1 and without exp2 considering the re infiltration process as shown in table 6 runoff et and dels represent the accumulative amount during the period of 0000 utc 14 september to 0000 utc 12 october 2018 and divided by drainage area the re infiltration process is consistently larger than the local infiltration and provides a superior contribution to the infiltration process during florence for cfrb and its major sub basins the re infiltration amounts to 76 of the total infiltration on average in addition the dominance of the re infiltration is more pronounced over the upper cfrb than the middle and lower parts over haw river basin above bynum 02096960 and deep river basin above moncure 02102000 the infiltration induced by the re infiltration process are 90 and 93 respectively meanwhile over the little river basin above manchester 02103000 black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 and northeast river basin above chinquapin 02108000 the refiltration account for 62 63 and 75 of the total infiltration respectively we attribute the less significant role of re infiltration over lower and middle cfrb than the upper part to the larger amount of rainfall the former two parts received with the torrential precipitation lasting for days the soil over lower and middle cfrb can get saturated from local infiltration very quickly once the soil became saturated little soil deficit would be available for the re infiltration process to happen even though overland flow routed laterally in this case re infiltration may take a less important part in total infiltration moreover the re infiltration process has a significant influence on both the amplitude and timing of the peak discharge without considering the re infiltration effect simulated peak discharges over the major and sub basins could arrive 6 17 h earlier with the amplitudes being 1 3 2 8 times of the observed ones in this case the re infiltration process has largely decreased the peak flood amplitude and delayed its timing 5 summary and conclusion based on qpes rain gage and streamflow observations as well as results from a numerical model we investigated the flood response of the cfrb during florence and analyzed the hydrometeorological and hydrologic controls behind it the main results from this study are summarized as follows 1 among stage iv nldas v2 and mrms stage iv is the best product in reproducing the storm total rainfall mm kge 0 82 and hourly rainfall intensity mm h kge 0 77 over the cfrb during florence 2 because of the slow motion and l shaped track florence induced rainfall was much higher in amount than that caused by the other major hurricanes affected cfrb the resultant storm total rainfall then controlled the runoff depth unit peak discharge and the shape of flood hydrograph at the basin scale 3 hydrologic characteristics exerted influence on flood response at the sub basin scale the distinctive bi peak shape of the flood hydrograph at moncure 02102000 in the deep river basin was partly due to the spatial heterogeneity of land cover and topographic gradient the exceptional unit peak discharge at tomahawk 02106500 was associated with the small width of its channel network relatively steep topographic gradient and rainfall distribution in addition the coastal flood plain has acted as a buffer between upstream riverine flood and downstream storm surge which caused a 13 peak discharge attenuation and a 35 h delay of peak timing 4 numerical experiments suggest that re infiltration was superior to local infiltration over cfrb during florence for major and sub river basins re infiltration accounted for 76 of the total infiltration on average without the re infiltration effect the peak discharge could be 1 3 2 8 times of observed ones and arrive 6 17 h earlier in summary the results achieved here show that the slow motion in combination to the l shaped track was the most distinctive feature of florence that resulted in the catastrophic rainfall and flooding all over the cfrb at the basin scale the flood response strongly depends on the storm total rainfall instead of rainfall intensity this finding aligns with hewlett et al 1977 but differs from the case of puerto rico during hurricane georges where the flood response was highly controlled by peak rainfall rates smith et al 2005 such difference should be due to the faster response of puerto rico watershed than cfrb which is tied to their difference in topographic gradients at sub basin scales in consistent with what is reported by previous studies lininger and latrubesse 2016 sturdevant rees et al 2001 zhang et al 2001 land use soil type coastal flood plain storage as well as the river network could exert secondary important influence on flood response re infiltration process similar with that reported by zhang et al 2020 was superior to local infiltration however due to the limited observation data availability human activity s effect e g dams and reservoirs on the flood response was not covered in this study in addition the influence of initial soil moisture on flood response as reported by previous studies grillakis et al 2016 li et al 2020 nikolopoulos et al 2011 uber et al 2018 can also be significant our study points out the important role that coastal flood plain played in attenuating the compound flooding modeling efforts may be further refined by incorporating the coastal flood plain and its influence on compound flooding potential during hurricane events through coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic simulations kumbier et

3863,hurricanes are the major flood generating mechanism dominating the upper tail of the peak discharge distribution over the cape fear river basin cfrb in 2018 hurricane florence swamped cfrb as the ninth most destructive hurricane ever hit the united states and set new records of peak discharges over the main river channel and three out of five of its major tributaries in this study we examined the hydrometeorology and hydrology of this flood via combined observation and numerical experiment analyses our results suggest that the slow motion in combination to the l shaped path was the most distinctive feature of the hurricane that incurred catastrophic and widespread rainfall and flooding over cfrb the total rainfall from the storm played a controlling role in the magnitude and spatial distribution of the flood peaks at basin scale above that the spatial heterogeneities of rainfall distribution and hydrologic characteristics was responsible for the distinctive flood responses within the basin the bi peak shape of the flood hydrograph for the deep river was due to the combined effects of rainfall distribution land cover and topographic gradient the exceptional unit peak discharge over the black river basin was associated with its drainage network structure topographic gradient and rainfall distribution the floodplain downstream of the cape fear river temporarily stored flood water and attenuated both the riverine floods from upstream and the compound flood over the coastal area furthermore numerical analyses found that re infiltration accounted for 76 of the total infiltration on average re infiltration was superior to local infiltration over cfrb during hurricane florence keywords hurricane florence flood hydrology hydrometeorology cape fear river basin wrf

distributions in the basin fig 1 a the top ten maximum unit peak discharges over the cape fear river and its five major tributaries were all induced by hurricanes fig 1b among them hurricane florence florence stands out as the most powerful flood generating event with more widespread and significant influence than the others during florence peak discharge records were set over the cape fear river and three out of its five major tributaries three u s geological survey usgs gages recorded peak discharges with return intervals equal to or larger than a 500 year flood event table 1 recent studies have assessed the extremeness of florence induced rainfall kunkel and champion 2019 and the principal causes behind it callaghan 2020 the flood induced by florence over the coastal area has been investigated using numerical model gori et al 2020 and observational data griffin et al 2020 williams et al 2020 in addition florence was also investigated to evaluate a newly proposed data assimilation method gharamti et al 2021 to explore the benefit of applying crowsourced data hultquist and cervone 2020 in flood mapping and to demonstrate the importance of an accurate representation of ocean state zambon et al 2021 in hurricane simulation nevertheless characteristics of the inland flooding and the controlling mechanism behind it has not been investigated yet the primary objective

with a summary and conclusions in section 5 2 study region and methodology 2 1 cape fear river basin as the largest river basin contained entirely within the borders of north carolina cfrb has a drainage area of 23 889 km2 inside the basin the elevation ranges from 364 m in the headwater region to nearly 0 m over the coastal plain area the cfrb contains five major sub basins fig 2 b which are the haw river and the deep river basin upstream the little river basin in the middle and the northeast cape fear river and black river basin downstream the haw river and deep river basin contains two usgs huc 8 units huc 03030002 and huc 03030003 fig 2d and features a rolling and hilly landscape the little river basin is within the middle cfrb huc 03030003 and is characterized by rolling terrain with little relief the lower cfrb is composed of 3 usgs huc 8 units huc 03030005 07 fig 2d and is drained by the main stem of cape fear river black river and northeast cape fear river from west to east respectively the topography in the lower part of cfrb is characterized by low elevation and minimum topographic gradient from 1996 to 2018 13 hurricanes have made landfalls in the basin or passed by within 120 km from it six hurricanes have caused significant flood damages gori et al 2020 a recent study suggests a regime shift in coastal north carolina towards increasingly high precipitation associated with tropical cyclones paerl et al 2019 in addition cfrb is the most industrialized watershed in north carolina with large industries and dozens of big cities sitting within its boundaries the cfrb involves intensive water management activities there are around 1 100 impoundments with dams spread over the basin the majority of which are in the upper part curtis weaver et al 2001 among them the b everett jordan lake jordan lake hereafter fig 2b is the largest surface area impoundment covering an area of 56 4 km2 located 7 km upstream of the mouth of the haw river jordan lake dam is able to retain the runoff from the drainage area from a six inch rainfall n c department of environmental quality division of water resources 2016 along the deep river and the mainstream of cape fear river there is also a series of small dams those dams are typically operated on the basis of run of river mode in which outflows from them are almost equal to inflows weaver and carolina 1997 according to the 21 category modified international geosphere biosphere programme igbp moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis land cover product there are 16 types of land cover over the cfrb the dominant land use types are cropland natural vegetation mosaic 32 mixed forests 20 deciduous broadleaf forest 18 besides that croplands and urban built up account for 6 8 and 3 5 over the whole basin respectively the soil types are mainly sandy loam 33 6 loamy sand 24 2 sand 22 1 silt loam 11 9 and loam 7 1 according to the state soil geographic database miller and white 1998 2 2 methodology our analysis was performed based on both observation and numerical simulation observation data used are detailed in table 2 and table 3 which include three qpe products rain gage observations streamflow observations and annual peak discharges numerical simulations were conducted using wrf hydro gochis et al 2020 which is detailed in section 4 4 it should be noted that the qpe products were evaluated against the rain gage observations prior to formal analysis a point to grid rain gage to qpe comparison over storm total rainfall and hourly rainfall intensity following previous studies cánovas garcía et al 2018 thiemig et al 2012 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 was carried out here storm total rainfall refers to the accumulated precipitation from 0000 utc 14 to 0000 utc 18 september 2018 the modified kling gupta efficiency kge eq 1 gupta et al 2009 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 was calculated to quantitatively measure the overall agreement between estimates and rain gage observations the calculation of kge eq 1 involves three independent components pearson correlation coefficient γ eq 2 relative bias α eq 3 and variability term β eq 4 which can be used to assess the skill of qpes in reproducing the temporal variation average intensity and distribution of the observed rainfall respectively the optimal value of kge is 1 with a higher value indicating better performance γ ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 representing the absence of linear correlation between estimation and observation α 1 implies an overall overestimation while α 1 represents underestimation similarly β can be used to investigate whether the variability of estimation is larger or smaller than observation 1 kge 1 γ 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 2 γ 1 n x estimation μ estimation x obs μ obs 1 n x estimation μ estimation 2 1 n x obs μ obs 2 3 α μ estimation μ obs 4 β σ estimation μ estimation σ obs μ obs where n represents the total number of data points x estimation and x obs denote the rainfall estimation from qpe products and rain gage observation respectively μ estimation and μ obs are the mean values of rainfall estimation and observation σ estimation and σ obs stand for the standard deviations of estimation and observation respectively 3 hydrometeorological analysis of florence 3 1 qpe evaluation table 4 and fig 3 summarize the performance of the three qpe products in reproducing the storm total rainfall mm and hourly rainfall intensity mm h during florence all three qpes can satisfactorily capture the storm total rainfall with kge larger than 0 7 stage iv appears to be the best product with the highest kge 0 82 and closest to one β and γ besides all three qpes underestimated the storm total rainfall with α less than 1 as shown in fig 3a a consistent underestimation is observed over stage iv reproduced rainfall while mrms and nldas v2 both overestimate low values 220 mm and underestimate high ones 220 mm similarly the qpes all tend to be able to provide reasonable hourly rainfall intensity with satisfactory kge values larger than 0 7 here stage iv and mrms present comparable skills with kge 0 77 and 0 76 respectively which are better than nldas v2 0 71 while stage iv shows better performance in capturing the temporal variation of rainfall intensity with a higher γ 0 85 value than that of mrms 0 80 the latter α 0 96 is superior to the former α 0 88 in reproducing the average rainfall intensity based on the evaluation we consider stage iv as the best qpe product for reproducing the rainfall over cfrb during florence the following precipitation analysis and numerical simulation are thus based on stage iv 3 2 precipitation analysis florence made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near wrightsville beach north carolina around 1115 utc 14 september 2018 fig 4 a it then moved towards the southwest along the coastal area and degraded into a tropical storm by 0000 utc 15 september another 12 h later the system turned westward and moved slowly across south carolina for an additional 24 h by 1800 utc 16 september it degraded into a tropical depression from then on the storm accelerated towards the north and became extratropical by 1200 utc on 17 september finally it dissipated around 1800 utc the next day florence was a slow moving system prior to and immediately after landfall the forward speed ranged from 3 6 14 4 km h during 14 16 september kunkel and champion 2019 this sluggish speed led to torrential rainfall accumulation over the lower cfrb in addition florence followed a unique track as shown in fig 4a major hurricanes impacting cfrb such as fran 1996 floyd 1999 and matthew 2016 followed a relatively constant direction before and after passing over cfrb by contrast florence showed an l shaped path as it tracked along the path its rainbands extended into different parts of cfrb from the coastal plain to the headwater area as discussed right below and summarized in table s1 the combination of the slow storm motion and the unique track was the distinctive hydrometeorological feature of florence that contributed to the widespread flood response over the entire cfrb fig 4b compares the storm total rainfall associated with the four most disastrous hurricanes impacting cfre the storm total rainfall induced by florence is the highest among all four major hurricanes over not only the major basin but also each sub basin this tremendous amount of rainfall laid the foundation for the widespread and extreme flood with which other hurricane events cannot compete in addition with stage iv qpe and rain gage observations we present the spatiotemporal evolution of the rainfall distribution and its influence on rainfall intensity across the basin following the method of jiang et al 2013 the rainfall fields associated with florence at different stages were categorized into the inner core region the inner rainband region and the outer rainband region the inner core region includes eyewalls when the storm has a discernible eye immediately adjacent to inner core region is the inner rainband which extends outward for about 100 km the outer rainband locates approximately 150 200 km from the center of the storm and extends to the farthest rainfall element the rainband of florence approached cfrb around 0000 utc on 14 september fig 5 a as a result of its path precipitation was initially measured by a rain gage over the lower part of cfrb fig 6 b florence was a category 2 hurricane by that time the eye of which was approximately 100 km from the land the inner core and inner rainband were well developed and were mainly located over the right front quadrant this rainband distribution resulted in an asymmetric rainfall structure eight hours later a thin inner rainband reached the downstream part of the lower cfrb fig 5b this rainband was responsible for the first pulse of heavy rainfall rainfall rate greater than 10 mm h fig 6a at 1100 utc 14 september florence made landfall fig 5c and started cresting across the lower cfrb meanwhile the rain area of florence broadened the inner core and inner rainband controlled the rainfall over the lower cfrb until 1500 utc 14 september when the inner core moved out of cfrb fig 5d marking the end of the first pulse of rainfall fig 6a b since then inner and outer rainbands took over as the major rainfall agent for the lower cfrb by 0900 utc 15 september the largest rainfall rate from the storm occurred due to strong convection from an inner rainband that extended along the mainstem of the cape fear river see fig 5e maximum rainfall rates observed at usgs gage 02105769 fig 6a and coop hpd v2 gage usc00311881 fig 6b were 33 3 mm h and 43 7 mm h respectively florence degraded into a tropical storm fig 5g and lost its distinguishable rainfall structure at 1800 utc 16 september afterward the system accelerated northward and the lower cfrb became out of reach from the rainbands after which little rainfall was observed thus the period of rainfall was mainly from 0000 utc 14 to 18 000 utc 16 september for 67 h over the lower cfrb during this period 88 of 500 mm storm total rainfall over the reach between tarheel 02105500 and kelly 02105769 along the cape fear river was dumped 85 and 95 of the 411 mm and 512 mm storm total rainfall over the black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 and northeast cape fear river basin above chinquapin 02108000 were accumulated respectively over the middle cfrb where the little river basin resides the first pulse of rainfall fig 6c 6d commenced as an outer rainband arrived at 1500 utc 14 september fig 5d from then on till 0800 utc 17 september fig 5h rainfall over this area was controlled by the outer rainband of florence following the movement of the storm the middle cfrb fell in or out of the coverage of the rainband consequently five pulses of rainfall were observed at the rain gages fig 6c d during this 66 hour rainfall window 97 of 269 mm storm total rainfall over the little river above manchester 02103000 was accumulated mean rainfall intensities were 4 0 mm h at usgs 02102908 and 4 5 mm h at usc00313017 respectively and the maximum rainfall intensities were 25 1 mm h and 34 5 mm h respectively which only lasted for one hour during the last pulse two pulses of rainfall were observed over the upper part of the basin fig 6e f the first one started from 1800 utc 14 september and lasted for 48 h until the degradation of florence into tropical depression fig 5g during this period rainfall was light to moderate the accumulative rainfall over haw river basin above bynum 02096960 and deep river basin above moncure 02102000 were 29 mm and 86 mm respectively mean rainfall rates were 1 8 mm h and 0 6 mm h and maximum rainfall rates 8 1 mm h and 5 6 mm h at usgs gage 02098197 fig 6e and 02096500 fig 6f respectively following the first pulse of rainfall the outer rainband associated with the hurricane remnant passed over and induced rainfall for another 20 h till 1300 utc 17 september fig 5j the second pulse of rainfall was much heavier than the first one the accumulated rainfall over the haw river basin above bynum 02096960 and the deep river basin above moncure 02102000 during this period were 89 mm and 137 mm respectively the mean rainfall rates observed at usgs gage 02098197 fig 6e and 02096500 fig 6f were 5 8 mm h and 4 6 mm h respectively the largest rainfall rate during this period occurred at 1000 utc on 17 september fig 5i due to the intensive convection over a remnant rainband usgs gage 02098197 fig 6e and 02096500 fig 6f observed maximum rainfall rates of 37 3 mm h and 22 4 mm h respectively 4 flood hydrology in this section we analyze the flood hydrology associated with florence based on rainfall and streamflow observations table 5 summarizes the flood response to florence in terms of unit peak discharge runoff depth runoff to rainfall ratio lag time and runoff volume to peak discharge ratio vp ratio hereafter unit peak discharge was observed peak discharge divided by the drainage area unit peak discharge and vp ratio can both be used to characterize flood response the unit peak discharge is influenced by rainfall forcing and land surface characteristics lower values can be the result of either lower rainfall input or flood attenuation related to basin characteristics or both by contrast the vp ratio reflects mainly the influence of basin features on flood response it can be used to quantify the relative magnitude of peak discharge and total runoff volume smaller values imply higher peak discharge tendency and quicker response of the basin runoff depth was computed by integrating observed discharge over the period of 0000 utc 14 september to 0000 utc 12 october 2018 and dividing it by drainage area basin averaged storm total rainfall was calculated from stage iv qpe for the period of 0000 utc 14 september to 0000 utc 18 september lag time refers to the difference between the time of peak discharge and that at which 50 of the total rainfall occurs smith et al 2000 note that for gages downstream of jordan lake dam along the main stem of the cape fear river the released discharge from the dam was subtracted from the observation to exclude its effect on flood response 4 1 storm total rainfall over sub river basins storm total rainfall was the predominant control of runoff depth over the major sub basins as is shown in table 5 the runoff to rainfall ratio decreases from the haw river and deep river basins in the hilly upper cfrb to the little river basin in the middle and the black river and northeast cape fear river basins over the coastal region the highest and lowest runoff to rainfall ratio are found in haw river at bynum 02096960 and northeast cape fear river at chinquapin 02108000 respectively on the contrary runoff depth increases from upstream to downstream over the sub river basins indicating the dominance of the storm total rainfall over the hydrologic characteristics in runoff production in the sub basins along the main stem of the cape fear river runoff was preferentially generated over the high elevation upstream area and low elevation coastal regions from moncure 02102000 at the deep river to lillington 02102500 at the mainstem both runoff depth and runoff to rainfall ratio decrease the decreasing trend is carried on further downstream to tar heel 02105500 then further downstream from tar heel 02105500 to kelly 02105769 runoff depth and runoff to rainfall ratio increase again this trend of runoff coefficient points out the higher flooding potential over the upper and lower cfrb than that in the middle part as is shown in table 5 the runoff to rainfall ratios over the reach from moncure 02102000 to lillington 02102500 and from lillington 02102500 to tar heel 02105500 are 0 44 and 0 54 respectively in sharp contrast the ratio reaches 1 for the drainage area from tar heel 02105500 to kelly 02105769 in addition the vp ratios are generally lower over the sub river basins in the upper cfrb table 5 however the unit peak discharges tend to follow the trend of storm total rainfall being higher in lower cfrb this implies the dominance of storm total rainfall in controlling the peak discharge amplitude in the sub river basins further storm total rainfall instead of peak rainfall rates was the major controller of the peak discharge distribution during florence fig 7 compares the time series of basin averaged rainfall intensity with that of the streamflow despite the multi peak signature of the hyetographs the flood hydrographs are characterized by one major peak after or right before the end of rainfall this implies that rainfall intensity played a minimal role in influencing the peak response compared to storm total rainfall during florence 4 2 land cover topographic gradient and flood plain storage in this part the timing signature of flood response is analyzed with lag time and vp ratio as shown in table 5 the lag times of the sub basins over the lower and middle cfrb are two times larger than those of the haw river and deep river basin in the upper part this difference is attributable to the decrease of the topographic gradient from hilly upstream to the flat coastal region in cfrb in correspondence the vp ratio follows a similar trend with an exception found at moncure 02102000 over deep river the lag time at moncure 02102000 is shorter than that at bynum 02096960 table 5 which indicates the faster response of the deep river basin than the haw river basin to rainfall forcing during florence however the vp ratio of the former is 68 higher than that of the latter falling in the same magnitude with the basins downstream this inconsistency and abnormal larger vp ratio at moncure 02102000 is related to the bi peak shape of the flood hydrograph fig 8 a fig 8a shows the nested flood hydrograph for gages along the deep river the initial rise of the flood hydrograph at moncure 02102000 is attributable to the first pulse of rainfall as mentioned in section 3 and shown in fig 7b the major peak is mainly due to the downstream advection from ramseur 02100500 and siler city 02101726 to moncure meanwhile the second peak is caused primarily by the advection from runoff produced over the intervening drainage area between ramseur 02100500 and moncure 02102000 as shown in fig 8b rainfall mainly accumulated over the southwest part of deep river basin during florence here the land cover is mainly forest fig 8c and topographic gradient is low compared to that of ramseur 02100500 and siler city 02101726 in upstream fig 8d thus the velocity of both overland flow and channel flow should be much slower than upstream due to the low topographic gradient and the attenuation effect of forest as a result the flood wave contributed by this southwest part of the basin should arrive at the deep river mouth moncure 02102000 later than that from the upstream area resulting in the bi peak shape of the flood hydrograph it is thus reasonable to argue that this bi peak signature of the flood hydrograph due to the combined effect of rainfall distribution and spatial heterogeneity of land cover and topography should have decreased the amplitude of the flood but increased the duration of it fig 9 a shows the nested flood hydrograph from moncure 02102000 at the deep river to kelly 02105769 downstream of the cape fear river the timing difference in the initial rise of the flood hydrograph suggests the control of storm motion from downstream to upstream on flood response moreover the similarity between flood hydrographs at moncure 02102000 and lillington 02102500 gives the idea that the bulk of the flood at the latter was contributed by deep river further downstream the bi peak feature disappeared and merged into one at tar heel 02105500 with a significant difference found between flood hydrographs at tar heel 02105500 and lillington 02102500 this indicates the contribution of the middle cfrb to the cape fear river flood downstream along the mainstem of the cape fear river from lillington 02102500 to kelly 02105769 the unit peak discharges decrease with the increasing vp ratios table 5 this decrease in peak discharge is due to the flood plain attenuation effect a 13 peak discharge attenuation and a 35 h delay of peak timing are observed between tar heel 02105500 and kelly 02105769 this can be attributed to the floodplain storage effect to analyze this the net discharge hydrograph was derived by subtracting the observed streamflow at tar heel 02105500 from that at kelly 02105769 as shown in fig 9b during 2000 utc 14 to 0400 utc 21 september a total volume of 177 million m3 streamflow from upstream was stored in the flood plain between tar heel 02105500 and kelly 02105769 this storage not only has attenuated the riverine flood from upstream but also has lessened the compound flooding downstream around the cape fear river estuary area considering that the volume of the cape fear river estuary is 253 million m3 ensign et al 2004 the water stored in the flood plain could have flushed out at least 70 of the water in the terminal estuary fig 9c shows the observed total water level and its low passed filtered component with a cutting off frequency of 40 hour using a butterworth filter method the filtered water level represents the component induced by storm surge and riverine input the storm surge induced water level peaked around 0430 utc september 15 at 3 44 m above the mean sea level after that the surge retreated later as the river input increased its impact on the low frequency water level became dominant starting from 0400 utc september 19 the filtered water level tended to increase again and peaked at 3 44 m around 0142 utc september 23 however if there was no timing delay associated with the downstream flood plain we could expect that the riverine freshwater could have entered the cape fear river estuary days earlier with a larger flood peak this more significant riverine input could interact with a then higher storm surge to make the compound flooding more devastating in other words the downstream flood plain has acted as a buffer between upstream riverine flood and downstream storm surge which largely attenuated both the riverine flood from upstream but also the compound flooding in the coastal area 4 3 drainage network soil type and rainfall distribution as is shown in fig 1b five of the top ten largest unit peak discharges are associated with florence among them the maximum is found over the black river at tomahawk 02106500 with a value of 0 89 m3 s 1 km 2 table 5 it is 19 larger than the second maximum 0 75 m3 s 1 km 2 at 02108000 table 5 and 35 larger than the previous record set by fran in 1996 to investigate the exceptional nature of this peak discharge we put it on the envelope cure developed for the coastal regions below the fall line in south carolina georgia and north carolina by feaster et al 2009 as is shown in fig 10 the unit peak discharge over the black river at tomahawk 02106500 is just below the envelope curve but well above the vast majority of data points of similar basin sizes here we investigate the controller of the exceptional unit discharge by comparing it with that of the second maximum at the ne cape fear river basin at chinquapin 02108000 it should be noted from table 5 that both storm total rainfall and runoff depth over chinquapin 02108000 are higher than that over tomahawk 02106500 whereas the drainage area gaged by the former 1551 km2 is smaller than that by the latter 1751 km2 this means that the larger unit peak discharge at tomahawk 02106500 was achieved with less runoff and rainfall over a larger drainage area than that at chinquapin 02108000 in addition the lag time at chinquapin 02108000 is 13 h shorter than that at tomahawk 02106500 moreover the runoff to rainfall ratio is 0 78 at tomahawk 02106500 which is 10 higher than that at chinquapin 02108000 we attribute the distinct flood response between the two to their differences in rainfall distribution soil type and drainage network fig 11 a shows the distribution of the storm total rainfall over the two basins during florence for the black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 large portions of rainfall accumulated over the east and northeast part of it there the soil type is mainly loamy sand as shown in fig 11c meanwhile over the ne cape fear river basin above chinquapin 02108000 most of the rainfall was dumped along the east half of the drainage area the soil type there is primarily sand as the water storage and hydraulic conductivity of sand are higher than that of loamy sand a larger amount of water loss to the former should be expected than that to the latter this difference in water loss can partly explain difference in rainfall to runoff ratio of the two basins the difference between the two neighboring basins in timing and magnitude of peak discharge is tied to the spatial distribution of rainfall relative to the drainage network it can be observed from fig 11a that a considerable portion of rainfall in the black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 dropped over the headwater area with lower channel order larger channel roughness and longer distance to the outlet on the contrary the majority amount of rainfall accumulated near the outlet of the northeast cape fear river basin above chinquapin 02108000 where the stream order channel roughness is high small in this case a faster peak discharge response to rainfall should be expected at chinquapin 02108000 than that at tomahawk 02106500 meanwhile as it can be observed from fig 11b the width of the channel over the most downstream part of the northeast cape fear river basin above chinquapin 02108000 is much larger than in the black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 moreover the topography of the former is flatter than the latter the larger channel width in combination with low topographic gradient is thus the notable feature that explains the smaller peak discharge at chinquapin 02108000 than that at tomahawk 02106500 4 4 re infiltration process re infiltration refers to the infiltration of overland flow as it moves downslope towards the channel which is also known as the run on effect corradini et al 2002 1998 nahar et al 2004 whereas local infiltration is defined as the amount of water infiltrating into the soil locally from the rainfall compared to the latter re infiltration normally acts as a secondary process however during storm events re infiltration can account for more than 50 of total infiltration zhang et al 2020 in addition the re infiltration process can significantly decrease the discharge during both rising and falling limbs corradini et al 1998 in this section we quantify the magnitude of the re infiltration amount and its effect on streamflow during florence using wrf hydro built upon the noah land surface model with multi parameterization options noah mp niu et al 2011 wrf hydro enhances the physical realism of the water cycle by integrating subsurface and overland flow routing base flow and channel routing via corresponding modules among those improvements the lateral overland routing allows for the consideration of re infiltration in the model in this study a calibrated wrf hydro model over the cfrb during florence was applied the computational domain has a dimension of 2490 west to east 3490 north to south with a 100 m horizontal resolution fig 2b which is 10 times finer than that of noah mp the timestep of noah mp is one hour while that of overland and channel routing is 10 s the precipitation forcing was regridded from the stage iv multi sensor rainfall estimation product other forcing variables including air temperature wind short and longwave radiation humidity and pressure were from phase 2 of the north american land data assimilation system mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 following zhang et al 2020 we calculated the total infiltration local infiltration and re infiltration according to the water balance equation eq 5 here the water storage change refers to the variation of subsurface water two numerical experiments were conducted in the first experiment exp1 lateral routing of surface runoff and the accompanied re infiltration were simulated in the second experiment exp2 while the lateral movement of the surface was modeled as well the re infiltration process during the routing was not simulated total infiltration can be calculated as the difference between precipitation input p eq 5 and the surface runoff runoff eq 5 which is equal to the sum of simulated water storage change dels eq 5 and evapotranspiration et eq 5 in exp1 here we ignored the amount of surface water that accumulated in the lakes which were not considered in the model in the same way local infiltration was derived by subtracting the simulated runoff runoff in exp2 from the precipitation p then the re infiltration was calculated by subtracting local infiltration from total infiltration 5 p e t r u n o f f d e l s table 6 summarizes the simulated water budget with exp1 and without exp2 considering the re infiltration process as shown in table 6 runoff et and dels represent the accumulative amount during the period of 0000 utc 14 september to 0000 utc 12 october 2018 and divided by drainage area the re infiltration process is consistently larger than the local infiltration and provides a superior contribution to the infiltration process during florence for cfrb and its major sub basins the re infiltration amounts to 76 of the total infiltration on average in addition the dominance of the re infiltration is more pronounced over the upper cfrb than the middle and lower parts over haw river basin above bynum 02096960 and deep river basin above moncure 02102000 the infiltration induced by the re infiltration process are 90 and 93 respectively meanwhile over the little river basin above manchester 02103000 black river basin above tomahawk 02106500 and northeast river basin above chinquapin 02108000 the refiltration account for 62 63 and 75 of the total infiltration respectively we attribute the less significant role of re infiltration over lower and middle cfrb than the upper part to the larger amount of rainfall the former two parts received with the torrential precipitation lasting for days the soil over lower and middle cfrb can get saturated from local infiltration very quickly once the soil became saturated little soil deficit would be available for the re infiltration process to happen even though overland flow routed laterally in this case re infiltration may take a less important part in total infiltration moreover the re infiltration process has a significant influence on both the amplitude and timing of the peak discharge without considering the re infiltration effect simulated peak discharges over the major and sub basins could arrive 6 17 h earlier with the amplitudes being 1 3 2 8 times of the observed ones in this case the re infiltration process has largely decreased the peak flood amplitude and delayed its timing 5 summary and conclusion based on qpes rain gage and streamflow observations as well as results from a numerical model we investigated the flood response of the cfrb during florence and analyzed the hydrometeorological and hydrologic controls behind it the main results from this study are summarized as follows 1 among stage iv nldas v2 and mrms stage iv is the best product in reproducing the storm total rainfall mm kge 0 82 and hourly rainfall intensity mm h kge 0 77 over the cfrb during florence 2 because of the slow motion and l shaped track florence induced rainfall was much higher in amount than that caused by the other major hurricanes affected cfrb the resultant storm total rainfall then controlled the runoff depth unit peak discharge and the shape of flood hydrograph at the basin scale 3 hydrologic characteristics exerted influence on flood response at the sub basin scale the distinctive bi peak shape of the flood hydrograph at moncure 02102000 in the deep river basin was partly due to the spatial heterogeneity of land cover and topographic gradient the exceptional unit peak discharge at tomahawk 02106500 was associated with the small width of its channel network relatively steep topographic gradient and rainfall distribution in addition the coastal flood plain has acted as a buffer between upstream riverine flood and downstream storm surge which caused a 13 peak discharge attenuation and a 35 h delay of peak timing 4 numerical experiments suggest that re infiltration was superior to local infiltration over cfrb during florence for major and sub river basins re infiltration accounted for 76 of the total infiltration on average without the re infiltration effect the peak discharge could be 1 3 2 8 times of observed ones and arrive 6 17 h earlier in summary the results achieved here show that the slow motion in combination to the l shaped track was the most distinctive feature of florence that resulted in the catastrophic rainfall and flooding all over the cfrb at the basin scale the flood response strongly depends on the storm total rainfall instead of rainfall intensity this finding aligns with hewlett et al 1977 but differs from the case of puerto rico during hurricane georges where the flood response was highly controlled by peak rainfall rates smith et al 2005 such difference should be due to the faster response of puerto rico watershed than cfrb which is tied to their difference in topographic gradients at sub basin scales in consistent with what is reported by previous studies lininger and latrubesse 2016 sturdevant rees et al 2001 zhang et al 2001 land use soil type coastal flood plain storage as well as the river network could exert secondary important influence on flood response re infiltration process similar with that reported by zhang et al 2020 was superior to local infiltration however due to the limited observation data availability human activity s effect e g dams and reservoirs on the flood response was not covered in this study in addition the influence of initial soil moisture on flood response as reported by previous studies grillakis et al 2016 li et al 2020 nikolopoulos et al 2011 uber et al 2018 can also be significant our study points out the important role that coastal flood plain played in attenuating the compound flooding modeling efforts may be further refined by incorporating the coastal flood plain and its influence on compound flooding potential during hurricane events through coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic simulations kumbier et

3864,understanding water and carbon fluxes over agroecosystem are fundamental for water resources management in arid areas however their dynamics and coupling at different temporal scales have not been well understood therefore in this study net ecosystem co2 exchange nee and evapotranspiration et over irrigated maize field were monitored using eddy covariance system during two crop growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 the dynamics of nee et and the resulted water use efficiency wue defined as nee et and their responses to the meteorological and hydrological factors were investigated at hourly scale when et increased at noon nee reached the plateau ahead of et which resulted in decreased wue the maize wue changed during the growing season average daytime wue at the heading stage was the largest 9 52 and 8 57 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2017 and 2018 respectively photosynthetically active radiation par was the primary driver controlling diurnal dynamics of nee and et in irrigated maize field while the opposite effects of vapor pressure deficit vpd on nee and et were identified when the vpd increased from 0 to 3 3 kpa the slope of the linear relationship between et and par increased whereas the slope of the linear relationship between nee and par decreased at daily scale the relationship between nee and et was generally linear with a slope of 8 59 g co2 kg 1 h2o which could be attributed to their similar sensitivities in response to canopy conductance par and soil water content in addition the effect of irrigation on wue was different depending on the crop development stage and crop physiological activities this study highlights that high vpd would decrease wue of maize growing in irrigated agroecosystems in arid areas keywords maize field net ecosystem co2 exchange evapotranspiration water use efficiency vapor pressure deficit 1 introduction water and carbon fluxes over agroecosystem have been thefocusof food energy water nexus studies the eddy covariance ec system has been widely used around the world to monitor water and carbon fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere law et al 2002 schmidt et al 2012 tarin et al 2020 verma et al 2005 ec measurements greatly help to investigate the dynamics of the fluxes and the environmental controls as well as estimates of water use efficiency wue beer et al 2009 niu et al 2011 this contributes to better water resource management and agricultural development under changing environmental conditions especially in arid areas suyker and verma 2010 wagle et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the coupling of water and carbon fluxes can be achieved by wue i e co2 assimilation per unit mass of water consumption wue has many forms in application the denominator is always evapotranspiration et and the numerator can be gross primary production gpp net ecosystem co2 exchange nee crop biomass or crop yield suyker and verma 2010 wagle et al 2018 zhao et al 2007 niu et al 2011 proposed that the response of wue to the meteorological factors e g precipitation and air temperature were different at different scales e g at leaf scale and at ecosystem scale the wue at leaf scale is mainly regulated by stomatal aperture whereas the wue at ecosystem scale varies with plant types environmental conditions and even human activities ito and inatomi 2012 xu et al 2019 besides the assessment of wue over various ecosystems indicated that the responsiveness of wue to drought in arid regions was different from and even contrary to that in humid regions xu et al 2019 et and carbon fluxes of agroecosystems in different regions have been quantified to evaluate crop wue and their influencing factors such as crop types phenology and irrigation qiu et al 2021 steduto and hsiao 1998 suyker et al 2004 wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 zhao et al 2007 estimated wue of winter wheat in the north china plain determined by various forms of carbon assimilation including gpp nee and biomass and all of them showed a consistent seasonal variation as the seasonal variations of water and carbon fluxes were closely related to crop phenology bai et al 2015 research on the wheat and maize rotation cropland in the north china plain reported that nee and net biome productivity of wheat were larger than that of maize zhang et al 2020 while four years ec monitoring suggested that et of wheat was much larger than that of maize resulting in decreased water productivity of wheat shen et al 2013 therefore it has been planned to convert the wheat maize rotation pattern to the single maize cropping pattern to save water in the high plain of west united states nee of rainfed maize was smaller than irrigated maize which was attributed to moisture stress condition suyker et al 2004 maize under both irrigated and rainfed conditions fixed 74 more carbon than soybean while only using 12 20 more water than soybean indicating larger wue of maize than that of soybean suyker and verma 2010 in arid regions research on water and carbon fluxes of irrigated cropland is essential for improvement of wue and agricultural production wagle et al 2018 studied water and carbon fluxes of irrigated sorghum and maize fields in the texas high plains it was found that both water and carbon fluxes were not inhibited under high evaporation demand and that maize was more sensitive to high air temperature t and vapor pressure deficit vpd than sorghum if t and vpd will increase in the future as predicted by climate models the yield of corn in the u s corn belt will be limited ort and long 2014 and a future increase in vpd will limit the future increase in maize yield due to a great increase in irrigation requirement delucia et al 2019 maize yield or carbon assimilation is influenced by both soil moisture and atmospheric evaporative demand rigden et al 2020 apart from soil water availability vpd is recognized to suitably characterize crop drought in the u s corn belt due to its dominant effect on canopy conductance gc and gpp kimm et al 2020 thus the variation of the coupling of water and carbon fluxes needs to be investigated as the effects of high vpd and soil moisture could be decoupled for irrigated maize field in arid areas to understand the sensitivity of water and carbon fluxes to drought conditions knowing the seasonal or interannual exchanges of et carbon fluxes and wue is insufficient bai et al 2015 beer et al 2009 schmidt et al 2012 when the relationship between gpp and et at sub daily scale was evaluated the effect of vpd was integrated into the underlying wue of seven ecosystems due to the hysteresis between et and gpp zhou et al 2014 lin et al 2019 evaluated the hysteresis of et and gpp between the morning and afternoon periods over kinds of ecosystems and found that et in the afternoon was relatively higher than in the morning and the variation of gpp was contrary as the intense diurnal fluctuations of water carbon fluxes and the complicated environmental factors such as atmospheric evaporation demand and water availability the characteristics of the fluxes and their coupling processes at daily and sub daily scales have not been well specified for agroecosystem conducting a two year crop growing season nee and et monitoring over irrigated maize field using ec system the main objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the dynamics of nee and crop growth over irrigated maize field and determine the wue defined as nee et and yield et 2 investigate the coupling of et and nee at different temporal scales and 3 evaluate the response of the water and carbon fluxes to the environmental factors and identify the contributing factor better understanding the dynamics of water and carbon fluxes and their interactions with the changing environment is fundamental for irrigation management and agricultural production in arid areas 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the fenzidi experimental station 41 09 n 107 39 e 1032 m altitude of china agricultural university in the hetao irrigation district fig 1 the hetao irrigation district is located in the upstream of the yellow river basin with an area of 1 12 million ha wang et al 2020b benefited from huge amount of irrigation water diverted from the yellow river this area is an important food production base despite of its semi arid climate with annual precipitation of 170 mm and annual evaporation of 2300 mm chen et al 2018 maize sunflower and spring wheat are the three dominant crops the fenzidi experimental station has a seasonally varying shallow groundwater table depth generally 3 m liu et al 2016 wang et al 2020a please see wang et al 2020b for more details about the experimental maize field the experiment was conducted during two maize growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 and ec system was used to continuously observe water vapor and carbon exchanges over the maize field the maize was sowed on may 12 in 2017 and on april 28 in 2018 and the maize was harvested at the end of september in both years thus the growth stages in 2017 shifted backwards about 4 7 days considering that in 2018 there were three irrigations in the 2017 maize growing season and four irrigations in the 2018 maize growing season table 1 the irrigation implemented on 2 june 2018 was probably to raise the groundwater table wang et al 2020b maize was planted in two rows with a spacing of about 36 cm and covered by mulching film with a width of about 60 cm the distance between mulching film was about 30 cm the division of maize growth stages including the seeding jointing heading filling and maturity stages were based on the field observation wang et al 2020b the seeding stage is from the sowing to three leaves grown with collars visible the jointing stage is from the seeding until the tasseling i e the fast developing stage the heading stage is from the tasseling until most plants are silking the filling stage is from the silking until dough i e the grain formation stage and the maturity stage is from the dough to physiological maturity 2 2 the experimental setup 2 2 1 water vapor and carbon fluxes measurements ec system mainly consists of a csat3 sonic anemometer gill solent instruments uk with an open path h2o co2 infrared li 7500 analyzer li cor inc usa the data such as net radiation soil heat flux were measured by the cnr4 l10 net radiometer two hfp01 heat flux plates and temperature humidity probes the instruments of ec system regarding to heat fluxes measurements were specifically introduced in the published work wang et al 2020b the sensors were initially installed at 2 5 m height when the canopy was lower than 1 m and later moved to a height of 4 5 m until harvest all the data were collected by cr3000 data logger et mm h 1 or mm d 1 was converted from the measured latent heat λet w m 2 and nee was determined by ecosystem carbon flux fc 1 λ e t λ ρ a w q 2 nee f c w ρ c where λ is the heat of water

outputs were post processed using the eddypro li cor inc lincoln usa software and several corrections such as frequency response corrections conversion of sonic virtual temperature into actual temperature coordinate rotation using planar fit method and wpl webb pearman leuning density fluctuation correction were included the reliability of the post processed ec fluxes was assessed and energy closures for all half hourly data were 0 732 in 2017 and 0 634 in 2018 considering the energy imbalance of ec system the bowen ratio preservation of energy principle which has been verified by the lysimetric result chavez et al 2009 ding et al 2010 was adopted to offset the turbulent fluxes anapalli et al 2018 wang et al 2020b abnormal spike of raw nee flux mainly occurring at night was removed and interpolated linearly nee flux gap filling and partitioning into gpp and ecosystem respiration were conducted using reddyprocweb online tool https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocweb 2 2 2 other measurements the aboveground biomass of maize was measured by oven drying 6 8 maize plants at each growth stage the plants were first split into three groups by organs stems leaves and grains then each group was heated at 105 c for 2 h in oven and dried at 70 c to a stable weight to obtain the dry biomass the meteorological data at 2 m height were observed through the automatic weather station and used to obtain par and reference crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 wang et al 2020a ec system can also collect meteorological data above maize canopy such as t relative humidity wind speed and vpd the meteorological conditions during maize growing season in 2017 and 2018 were typical in northwest china and daily t and relative humidity reached the maximum value in july the peaks of solar radiation were generally stable at approximately 350 w m 2 please see wang et al 2020b for details of the measurement and dynamics of soil water content swc and groundwater table depth wtd 2 3 data analysis according to the hourly measurements from ec system in 2017 and 2018 the correlation between nee and et was fitted by the linear and nonlinear equations which are shown in fig 3 in the following results section the adopted nonlinear equation is as follows 3 y ax 2 x 2 b different forms of nonlinear equations were tried and eq 3 was determined because it not only fitted the hourly results well but the parameters in eq 3 also indicated some important information that a represents the potential maximum nee absolute value at different stages and b reflects the slope of the fitted curve table 2 analysis of variance was used to determine the significance level between nee and et the fitting results were also evaluated by coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse wue g co2 kg 1 h2o and wueyield kg m 3 were calculated as 4 w u e n e e e t 5 w u e y i e l d y i e l d e t where yield kg ha 1 was the weight of maize grain after air drying the hourly variations of the fluxes were mainly determined by the environmental condition we examined the hourly responses of et and nee to the meteorological factors including par vpd and t at the heading and filling stages which were the key yield formation stages seasonal variations of et and nee could be attributed to vegetative growth status suyker and verma 2010 so the middle growth season about from june until august shown in fig 5 was considered to eliminate the impact of crop rapid growth and senescence on daily et and nee then the three day moving average was used to examine daily responses of et nee and wue to swc gc par and vpd the three day moving average could better represent their seasonal responses to the environmental factors because daily fluxes fluctuated intensely with the changeable weather conditions while swc changed gradually in addition data of four clear days before and after irrigation were considered to assess the effect of irrigation on the coupling of nee and et based on the measured micrometeorological data and λet penman monteith equation was used to calculate gc rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2017 6 g

the seasonal trends of daily and accumulated nee were similar between two years though data before july in 2017 were missing fig 2 the negative sign of nee indicated that maize field mainly absorbed co2 from the atmosphere during the growing season the variation of daily nee was closely related to maize growing stages with the rapid development at jointing stage in june daily nee increased significantly at the late growth stage during august with leaves senescence daily nee decreased significantly and was even positive somedays not shown in fig 2 it was cloudy or rainy weather condition with solar radiation even smaller than 10 w m 2 that limited photosynthesis the observation and the cumulation of daily nee in 2018 began from the jointing stage which better represented the whole seasonal pattern the beginning of observation in 2017 was late and the initial value of the accumulated nee on july 7 was set as 1 25 kg m 2 which was inferred from the accumulated nee corresponding to the same maize growth status in 2018 then the seasonal dynamics of the accumulated nee coincided with that of total aboveground dry biomass in both years as net assimilated co2 in maize field was mainly inverted to crop carbon gain suyker et al 2004 the accumulation of nee and total aboveground biomass in 2017 4 16 kg co2 m 2 and 3 79 kg m 2 were both larger than that in 2018 3 50 kg co2 m 2 and 2 87 kg m 2 however grain biomass accumulation rate 0 034 kg m 2 d 1 was close for two years the accumulation of grain biomass started around july 15 in 2018 and july 20 in 2017 3 2 characteristics of the water carbon coupling over maize field in arid area 3 2 1 the water carbon coupling relationship at hourly scale the positive correlations between hourly nee and et at different growth stages are shown in fig 3 generally the nonlinear fitting results based on eq 3 were better than the linear fitting result with larger coefficient of determination r2 except the maturity stage it indicated that the slope of nee et gradually decreased with the increase of et and the slope of nee et was influenced by vpd the parameters of the linear and nonlinear fittings differed for different stages table 1 the absolute value of parameter a decreased from the heading stage to the end and matched well with the maximum nee at each stage in 2017 and 2018 fig 3 parameter b reflected the increasing rate of the fitting slopes it was different for the two years but similar for the different stages in the same year though the linear slopes between nee and et in 2018 were smaller than that in 2017 nee reached its peak in 2018 earlier than in 2017 the diurnal dynamics of nee et and wue were similar at different growth stages fig 4 the average of nee at daytime was negative and et was positive du and liu 2013 wagle et al 2018 it is worth noting that nee reached the plateau ahead of et about 2 h in the morning especially at heading and filling stages this incomplete synchronous diurnal patterns of nee and et resulted in the rapid decrease of wue around noon the maximum wue appeared in the early morning and then wue showed a decline trend from the heading stage to the maturity stage in 2017 fig 4a c average daytime wue was 9 52 7 86 and 6 21 g co2 kg 1 h2o respectively from the jointing stage to the maturity stage in 2018 fig 4d g it was 8 57 9 43 7 91 and 4 65 g co2 kg 1 h2o respectively wue at the heading stage was the largest which was consistent with the result of winter wheat in the north china plain zhao et al 2007 3 2 2 the water carbon coupling relationship at daily scale the coupling of et and nee over maize field at daily scale showed a linear relationship in general for both years fig 5 and maize agroecosystem net absorbed 8 59 g co2 i e 2 34 g c when consumed 1 kg h2o per day which was a little larger than that of winter wheat 1 50 2 08 g c kg h2o in north china plain zhao et al 2007 wue in both years exhibited a similar seasonal variation specifically when maize quickly expanded at the jointing stage the function of carbon assimilation was improved on the other hand reduction of wue was evident during the maturity stage where leaves started to senesce the magnitude of daily wue reached around 15 g co2 kg 1 h2o in both years 3 3 the response of et and nee to the environmental factors 3 3 1 effects of meteorological conditions on hourly et and nee the correlation analyses in fig s2 indicated that both et and nee increased with the increase of par whereas neither et nor nee showed significant correlation with vpd or t the slopes of the relationship between et and par were always increasing with the increase in vpd and t ranges in both years fig 6 this illustrated that the maize et was not limited under the warming environmental condition with high water demand while the positive responses of nee par were much distinct the slopes between nee and par decreased with the increasing vpd which suggested that nee was limited by high vpd fig 6b and f this phenomenon occurred obviously when vpd exceeded 2 kpa in 2017 and 1 kpa in 2018 in addition when the range of t increased under same par condition fig 6d and h nee was also improved in 2017 or generally stable in 2018 our findings agreed well with that of pingintha et al 2010 who found that nee of a rainfed peanut field was suppressed under high vpd and high t during periods of water stress due to stomatal limitation of photosynthesis and higher ecosystem respiration so the relationship of et par and the relationship of nee par had opposite responses to the increase of vpd 3 3 2 effects of swc gc and meteorological factors on daily nee et and wue the influences of environmental factors on et nee and wue at daily scale are shown in fig 7 results indicated that both et and nee were positively correlated with swc gc and par gc representing crop stomatalcontrol was the most significant factor for explaining daily et and nee when par was around 700 μmol m 2 s 1 the small et and nee was limited by high vpd vpd seemed to have a limitation effect on the fluxes after vpd exceeding about 0 8 kpa under high vpd conditions maize tends to close their stomata which limits photosynthetic activities rigden et al 2020 even under irrigation condition the linear relationship between nee and et at daily scale fig 5 could be attributed to the similar sensitivities of nee and et in response to changing environmental drivers as a result the effects of swc gc and par on wue were insignificant vpd showed a slightly negative effect on wue during the middle growth season in both years thus the limitation of vpd on wue seemed to also exist at daily scale in this area the maximum wue in fig 7 occurred at the heading stage with the corresponding environmental conditions of high swc low vpd and gc of 8 8 mm s 1 3 3 3 effects of irrigations on the coupling of nee et the extra irrigation at the early stage in 2018 mainly increased soil evaporation instead of promoted crop photosynthesis and nee as maize cannot assimilate much co2 at that growth stage fig s4 comparing the nee et relationship before and after the first irrigation nee increased with constant et and the magnitude of increase was larger at higher constant et fig 8 during this period maize was at vigorous growth stage with lai 3 m2 m 2 fig s1 and high water demand wang et al 2020b the increased water availability after the irrigation effectively promoted net assimilation of co2 by consuming same amount of water while the distributions before and after the second irrigation were close suggesting that the irrigation had no significant effect on the coupling of nee et for the third irrigation the slope of the nee et curve even decreased a little the effects of the three irrigations on the coupling of nee et depended on crop growth stages fig 8 ineffective soil evaporation resulting from large irrigation could affect the relationship between et and nee but its effect was not the principal reason in this area since replacing et by maize transpiration tr the coupling of nee tr before and after irrigations was generally consistent with that of nee et fig s5 the optimal allocation of irrigation to improve wue would be complicated considering crop physiological characteristics at different growth stages 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal et nee and wue for both years the seasonal dynamics of et nee and wue for agroecosystem are closely related to crop characteristics and water conditions zhao et al 2007 the peak of nee was about 70 g co2 m 2 d 1 corresponding to 19 g c m 2 d 1 fig 2 which was larger than that of maize field in the north china plain and texas high plains 13 15 g c m 2 d 1 shen et al 2013 wagle et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 this could be explained by the condition of relatively sufficient soil water 0 3 m3 m 3 and net radiation 200 w m 2 or 17 3 mj m 2 day 1 in our study suyker et al 2004 wang et al 2020b swc and net radiation during maize growing season in the north china plain was generally smaller than 0 3 m3 m 3 without irrigation and 17 mj m 2 day 1 respectively shen et al 2013 swc and par in texas high plains was always smaller than 0 28 m3 m 3 and 750 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively wagle et al 2018 swc was relatively sufficient with the presence of shallow groundwater table depth and had a positive effect on et and nee fig 7 the maize growing season was shorter in the north china plain from early june to late september about 107 days and was similar in texas high plains from may 10 to middle october comparing with our study site besides the higher wue of maize comparing to winter wheat and soybean was demonstrated by the result of shen et al 2013 and suyker and verma 2010 wue nee et and wueyield yield et for two years at the study site were quantified the total observed et in 111 days during maize growing season was 557 2 mm in 2017 june 5 to sept 23 and was 453 8 mm in 2018 june 1 to sept 19 wang et al 2020b although the measured yield in 2018 14018 kg ha 1 was smaller than that in 2017 15910 kg ha 1 wueyield was 8 2 higher than 2017 similarly wue in 2018 2 10 g c kg 1 h2o was also higher than that in 2017 2 03 g c kg 1 h2o this suggested that the deeper wtd in 2018 than 2017 limited et and nee wang et al 2020b but increased wue wang et al 2020a the assessment of et gpp and wue for agroecosystems in the shiyang river basin of northwestern china indicates that through water saving irrigation practice et was reduced while wue could be increased kang et al 2000 tian and zhang 2020 larger dry biomass and nee accumulation of maize in 2017 consumed more water however it should be noted that the increasing rates 0 034 kg m 2 d 1 of grain biomass in two years were similar fig 2 this was attributed to larger proportion of stem and leaves dry biomass in 2017 fig 9 during the early growing period about 70 days after sowed only maize stem and leaves expanded thereafter grain began to accumulate while stem and leaves did not increase any more the larger expansion of stem and leaves in vegetative growth stage and the corresponding increased et did not significantly affect yield formation which could also decrease seasonal wue 4 2 wue explained by the coupling of hourly nee and et except the seasonal variation of wue over agroecosystems bai et al 2015 suyker and verma 2010 zhao et al 2007 a better understanding of wue at hourly scale is needed for precise irrigation crop water consumption and food security under climate warming condition in the future lin et al 2019 lobell et al 2013 the diurnal patterns of nee et and wue in fig 4 showed a decline trend of wue during daytime to better explore the hourly coupling of nee and et the diurnal dynamics were divided into two periods by 12 00 fig 10 the clockwise directions shown by the arrows at each period clearly illustrated that the diurnal dynamic of et lagged behind that of nee zhou et al 2014 this was consistent across all stages except for the maturity stage in 2018 the hysteresis here could be attributed to the hysteresis between et and par rather than the hysteresis between nee and par fig s3 the larger et in the afternoon under the same par resulted from the higher vpd in the afternoon lin et al 2019 besides with the increase in et during midday periods 12 00 15 00 nee did not increase accordingly at most stages fig 10 i e nee reached the plateau ahead of et fig 4 this phenomenon suggested that excessive et at midday time in arid areas would decrease wue which can becalled luxury et sinclair et al 2005 the hourly coupling of et and nee and decreased wue at midday time agreed with our previous inference that midday depression improves wue through comparing water productivity under different wtds wang et al 2020a we can make a unit conversion to connect excessive et threshold in this study and maize transpiration in wang et al 2020a if excessive et rate e g 15 mm d 1 from fig 10a at midday time was completely converted into maize transpiration rate according to the planting density 1 20 m2 plant 1 it is about 75 g h 1 the observed sap velocity at midday time under the shallower wtd average 1 6 m was mostly larger than this converted threshold please see fig 6 in wang et al 2020a thus excess transpiration had no significant positive effect on nee and yield accumulation the hourly coupling of water carbon fluxes better explains the reason for inefficient water use and strongly supports wue improvement under the relatively deeper wtd average about 2 m in arid areas the results could largely help improve irrigation and drainage regimes in arid areas with shallow water table depth 4 3 dominant effect of vpd on the coupling of nee and et the influence of the environmental factors on et and carbon fluxes were discussed in previous literature bai et al 2015 suyker and verma 2010 wagle et al 2018 while the responses of hourly fluxes over irrigated maize field have not been well examined par was the primary driver controlling daytime nee and et and its effect did not show light saturation fig 6 and fig s2 the positive relationship of nee par was similar in the morning and in the afternoon pingintha et al 2010 while a hysteresis was observed for et par fig s3 this was attributed to the opposite response of nee and et to vpd fig 6 resulting from the conjoint regulation of leaves stomata on photosynthesis and transpiration this coupling process was closely related to crop physiological responses instantaneous stomatal action to drought meteorological conditions lawson and vialet chabrand 2019 carbon flux was suggested to be affected by physiological controls more than h2o flux in response to increased t and vpd in an arid grassland wagle et al 2015 during midday time maize stomata were inhibited by high vpd resulting in constrained carbon flux while et relied on not only stomatal aperture but also vpd gradient the increased et suggested that the increasing effect of vpd on et was stronger than stomatal limitation at noon the effect of vpd on the coupling of water and carbon fluxes would be regulated by soil water availability stomatal behavior of maize in the u s corn belt was identified to be dominated by vpd over swc especially when vpd and swc were decoupled under high vpd and high swc situation kimm et al 2020 the dominant effect of vpd on stomatal behavior and the coupling of water and carbon fluxes would significantly affect agricultural production and irrigation management ort and long 2014 stressed the limit on future maize yield in united states by the increasing vpd and drought sensitivity rigden et al 2020 illustrated that daily average vpd beyond about 1 3 kpa was detrimental for maize yield in dry years vpd is predicted to increase in the future which may limit the future increase in maize yields without irrigation delucia et al 2019 besides the effect of vpd on carbon flux we also identified the effect of increasing vpd on et nee and wue of irrigated maize field in arid areas it was found that wue could decreased under high vpd breeding better drought tolerant crops and controlling water availability in a suitable range to limit et under drought condition are necessary to prevent inefficient crop water use 5 conclusions based on the measurements by ec system over irrigated maize field in arid areas the coupling of et and nee fluxes at different temporal scales and their responses to environmental factors were analyzed during two maize growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 the average daytime wue was the highest at heading stage the hourly coupling of nee et and their diurnal dynamics suggested that when et was increasing at midday time under high vpd nee did not increase resulting in the decline in wue this could be attributed to their opposite responses to the increasing vpd both nee and et had a significantly positive correlation with par however the slope of the linear relationship of et par increased with the increasing vpd from 0 to 3 3 kpa while the slope of the linear relationship of nee par decreased with vpd at daily scale the relationship between nee and et was generally linear which could be attributed to their similar sensitivities in response to the environmental factors the maize field net absorbed 8 59 g co2 when consumed 1 kg h2o per day during the growing season in addition the coupling of et and nee in responses to irrigations varied at different stages which was regulated by crop physiological activity better understanding the coupling of water and carbon fluxes and the influencing factors of irrigated cropland in arid areas provides valuable information for water resources management and food production under climate

3864,understanding water and carbon fluxes over agroecosystem are fundamental for water resources management in arid areas however their dynamics and coupling at different temporal scales have not been well understood therefore in this study net ecosystem co2 exchange nee and evapotranspiration et over irrigated maize field were monitored using eddy covariance system during two crop growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 the dynamics of nee et and the resulted water use efficiency wue defined as nee et and their responses to the meteorological and hydrological factors were investigated at hourly scale when et increased at noon nee reached the plateau ahead of et which resulted in decreased wue the maize wue changed during the growing season average daytime wue at the heading stage was the largest 9 52 and 8 57 g co2 kg 1 h2o in 2017 and 2018 respectively photosynthetically active radiation par was the primary driver controlling diurnal dynamics of nee and et in irrigated maize field while the opposite effects of vapor pressure deficit vpd on nee and et were identified when the vpd increased from 0 to 3 3 kpa the slope of the linear relationship between et and par increased whereas the slope of the linear relationship between nee and par decreased at daily scale the relationship between nee and et was generally linear with a slope of 8 59 g co2 kg 1 h2o which could be attributed to their similar sensitivities in response to canopy conductance par and soil water content in addition the effect of irrigation on wue was different depending on the crop development stage and crop physiological activities this study highlights that high vpd would decrease wue of maize growing in irrigated agroecosystems in arid areas keywords maize field net ecosystem co2 exchange evapotranspiration water use efficiency vapor pressure deficit 1 introduction water and carbon fluxes over agroecosystem have been thefocusof food energy water nexus studies the eddy covariance ec system has been widely used around the world to monitor water and carbon fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere law et al 2002 schmidt et al 2012 tarin et al 2020 verma et al 2005 ec measurements greatly help to investigate the dynamics of the fluxes and the environmental controls as well as estimates of water use efficiency wue beer et al 2009 niu et al 2011 this contributes to better water resource management and agricultural development under changing environmental conditions especially in arid areas suyker and verma 2010 wagle et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the coupling of water and carbon fluxes can be achieved by wue i e co2 assimilation per unit mass of water consumption wue has many forms in application the denominator is always evapotranspiration et and the numerator can be gross primary production gpp net ecosystem co2 exchange nee crop biomass or crop yield suyker and verma 2010 wagle et al 2018 zhao et al 2007 niu et al 2011 proposed that the response of wue to the meteorological factors e g precipitation and air temperature were different at different scales e g at leaf scale and at ecosystem scale the wue at leaf scale is mainly regulated by stomatal aperture whereas the wue at ecosystem scale varies with plant types environmental conditions and even human activities ito and inatomi 2012 xu et al 2019 besides the assessment of wue over various ecosystems indicated that the responsiveness of wue to drought in arid regions was different from and even contrary to that in humid regions xu et al 2019 et and carbon fluxes of agroecosystems in different regions have been quantified to evaluate crop wue and their influencing factors such as crop types phenology and irrigation qiu et al 2021 steduto and hsiao 1998 suyker et al 2004 wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 zhao et al 2007 estimated wue of winter wheat in the north china plain determined by various forms of carbon assimilation including gpp nee and biomass and all of them showed a consistent seasonal variation as the seasonal variations of water and carbon fluxes were closely related to crop phenology bai et al 2015 research on the wheat and maize rotation cropland in the north china plain reported that nee and net biome productivity of wheat were larger than that of maize zhang et al 2020 while four years ec monitoring suggested that et of wheat was much larger than that of maize resulting in decreased water productivity of wheat shen et al 2013 therefore it has been planned to convert the wheat maize rotation pattern to the single maize cropping pattern to save water in the high plain of west united states nee of rainfed maize was smaller than irrigated maize which was attributed to moisture stress condition suyker et al 2004 maize under both irrigated and rainfed conditions fixed 74 more carbon than soybean while only using 12 20 more water than soybean indicating larger wue of maize than that of soybean suyker and verma 2010 in arid regions research on water and carbon fluxes of irrigated cropland is essential for improvement of wue and agricultural production wagle et al 2018 studied water and carbon fluxes of irrigated sorghum and maize fields in the texas high plains it was found that both water and carbon fluxes were not inhibited under high evaporation demand and that maize was more sensitive to high air temperature t and vapor pressure deficit vpd than sorghum if t and vpd will increase in the future as predicted by climate models the yield of corn in the u s corn belt will be limited ort and long 2014 and a future increase in vpd will limit the future increase in maize yield due to a great increase in irrigation requirement delucia et al 2019 maize yield or carbon assimilation is influenced by both soil moisture and atmospheric evaporative demand rigden et al 2020 apart from soil water availability vpd is recognized to suitably characterize crop drought in the u s corn belt due to its dominant effect on canopy conductance gc and gpp kimm et al 2020 thus the variation of the coupling of water and carbon fluxes needs to be investigated as the effects of high vpd and soil moisture could be decoupled for irrigated maize field in arid areas to understand the sensitivity of water and carbon fluxes to drought conditions knowing the seasonal or interannual exchanges of et carbon fluxes and wue is insufficient bai et al 2015 beer et al 2009 schmidt et al 2012 when the relationship between gpp and et at sub daily scale was evaluated the effect of vpd was integrated into the underlying wue of seven ecosystems due to the hysteresis between et and gpp zhou et al 2014 lin et al 2019 evaluated the hysteresis of et and gpp between the morning and afternoon periods over kinds of ecosystems and found that et in the afternoon was relatively higher than in the morning and the variation of gpp was contrary as the intense diurnal fluctuations of water carbon fluxes and the complicated environmental factors such as atmospheric evaporation demand and water availability the characteristics of the fluxes and their coupling processes at daily and sub daily scales have not been well specified for agroecosystem conducting a two year crop growing season nee and et monitoring over irrigated maize field using ec system the main objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the dynamics of nee and crop growth over irrigated maize field and determine the wue defined as nee et and yield et 2 investigate the coupling of et and nee at different temporal scales and 3 evaluate the response of the water and carbon fluxes to the environmental factors and identify the contributing factor better understanding the dynamics of water and carbon fluxes and their interactions with the changing environment is fundamental for irrigation management and agricultural production in arid areas 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the fenzidi experimental station 41 09 n 107 39 e 1032 m altitude of china agricultural university in the hetao irrigation district fig 1 the hetao irrigation district is located in the upstream of the yellow river basin with an area of 1 12 million ha wang et al 2020b benefited from huge amount of irrigation water diverted from the yellow river this area is an important food production base despite of its semi arid climate with annual precipitation of 170 mm and annual evaporation of 2300 mm chen et al 2018 maize sunflower and spring wheat are the three dominant crops the fenzidi experimental station has a seasonally varying shallow groundwater table depth generally 3 m liu et al 2016 wang et al 2020a please see wang et al 2020b for more details about the experimental maize field the experiment was conducted during two maize growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 and ec system was used to continuously observe water vapor and carbon exchanges over the maize field the maize was sowed on may 12 in 2017 and on april 28 in 2018 and the maize was harvested at the end of september in both years thus the growth stages in 2017 shifted backwards about 4 7 days considering that in 2018 there were three irrigations in the 2017 maize growing season and four irrigations in the 2018 maize growing season table 1 the irrigation implemented on 2 june 2018 was probably to raise the groundwater table wang et al 2020b maize was planted in two rows with a spacing of about 36 cm and covered by mulching film with a width of about 60 cm the distance between mulching film was about 30 cm the division of maize growth stages including the seeding jointing heading filling and maturity stages were based on the field observation wang et al 2020b the seeding stage is from the sowing to three leaves grown with collars visible the jointing stage is from the seeding until the tasseling i e the fast developing stage the heading stage is from the tasseling until most plants are silking the filling stage is from the silking until dough i e the grain formation stage and the maturity stage is from the dough to physiological maturity 2 2 the experimental setup 2 2 1 water vapor and carbon fluxes measurements ec system mainly consists of a csat3 sonic anemometer gill solent instruments uk with an open path h2o co2 infrared li 7500 analyzer li cor inc usa the data such as net radiation soil heat flux were measured by the cnr4 l10 net radiometer two hfp01 heat flux plates and temperature humidity probes the instruments of ec system regarding to heat fluxes measurements were specifically introduced in the published work wang et al 2020b the sensors were initially installed at 2 5 m height when the canopy was lower than 1 m and later moved to a height of 4 5 m until harvest all the data were collected by cr3000 data logger et mm h 1 or mm d 1 was converted from the measured latent heat λet w m 2 and nee was determined by ecosystem carbon flux fc 1 λ e t λ ρ a w q 2 nee f c w ρ c where λ is the heat of water

outputs were post processed using the eddypro li cor inc lincoln usa software and several corrections such as frequency response corrections conversion of sonic virtual temperature into actual temperature coordinate rotation using planar fit method and wpl webb pearman leuning density fluctuation correction were included the reliability of the post processed ec fluxes was assessed and energy closures for all half hourly data were 0 732 in 2017 and 0 634 in 2018 considering the energy imbalance of ec system the bowen ratio preservation of energy principle which has been verified by the lysimetric result chavez et al 2009 ding et al 2010 was adopted to offset the turbulent fluxes anapalli et al 2018 wang et al 2020b abnormal spike of raw nee flux mainly occurring at night was removed and interpolated linearly nee flux gap filling and partitioning into gpp and ecosystem respiration were conducted using reddyprocweb online tool https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocweb 2 2 2 other measurements the aboveground biomass of maize was measured by oven drying 6 8 maize plants at each growth stage the plants were first split into three groups by organs stems leaves and grains then each group was heated at 105 c for 2 h in oven and dried at 70 c to a stable weight to obtain the dry biomass the meteorological data at 2 m height were observed through the automatic weather station and used to obtain par and reference crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 wang et al 2020a ec system can also collect meteorological data above maize canopy such as t relative humidity wind speed and vpd the meteorological conditions during maize growing season in 2017 and 2018 were typical in northwest china and daily t and relative humidity reached the maximum value in july the peaks of solar radiation were generally stable at approximately 350 w m 2 please see wang et al 2020b for details of the measurement and dynamics of soil water content swc and groundwater table depth wtd 2 3 data analysis according to the hourly measurements from ec system in 2017 and 2018 the correlation between nee and et was fitted by the linear and nonlinear equations which are shown in fig 3 in the following results section the adopted nonlinear equation is as follows 3 y ax 2 x 2 b different forms of nonlinear equations were tried and eq 3 was determined because it not only fitted the hourly results well but the parameters in eq 3 also indicated some important information that a represents the potential maximum nee absolute value at different stages and b reflects the slope of the fitted curve table 2 analysis of variance was used to determine the significance level between nee and et the fitting results were also evaluated by coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse wue g co2 kg 1 h2o and wueyield kg m 3 were calculated as 4 w u e n e e e t 5 w u e y i e l d y i e l d e t where yield kg ha 1 was the weight of maize grain after air drying the hourly variations of the fluxes were mainly determined by the environmental condition we examined the hourly responses of et and nee to the meteorological factors including par vpd and t at the heading and filling stages which were the key yield formation stages seasonal variations of et and nee could be attributed to vegetative growth status suyker and verma 2010 so the middle growth season about from june until august shown in fig 5 was considered to eliminate the impact of crop rapid growth and senescence on daily et and nee then the three day moving average was used to examine daily responses of et nee and wue to swc gc par and vpd the three day moving average could better represent their seasonal responses to the environmental factors because daily fluxes fluctuated intensely with the changeable weather conditions while swc changed gradually in addition data of four clear days before and after irrigation were considered to assess the effect of irrigation on the coupling of nee and et based on the measured micrometeorological data and λet penman monteith equation was used to calculate gc rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2017 6 g

the seasonal trends of daily and accumulated nee were similar between two years though data before july in 2017 were missing fig 2 the negative sign of nee indicated that maize field mainly absorbed co2 from the atmosphere during the growing season the variation of daily nee was closely related to maize growing stages with the rapid development at jointing stage in june daily nee increased significantly at the late growth stage during august with leaves senescence daily nee decreased significantly and was even positive somedays not shown in fig 2 it was cloudy or rainy weather condition with solar radiation even smaller than 10 w m 2 that limited photosynthesis the observation and the cumulation of daily nee in 2018 began from the jointing stage which better represented the whole seasonal pattern the beginning of observation in 2017 was late and the initial value of the accumulated nee on july 7 was set as 1 25 kg m 2 which was inferred from the accumulated nee corresponding to the same maize growth status in 2018 then the seasonal dynamics of the accumulated nee coincided with that of total aboveground dry biomass in both years as net assimilated co2 in maize field was mainly inverted to crop carbon gain suyker et al 2004 the accumulation of nee and total aboveground biomass in 2017 4 16 kg co2 m 2 and 3 79 kg m 2 were both larger than that in 2018 3 50 kg co2 m 2 and 2 87 kg m 2 however grain biomass accumulation rate 0 034 kg m 2 d 1 was close for two years the accumulation of grain biomass started around july 15 in 2018 and july 20 in 2017 3 2 characteristics of the water carbon coupling over maize field in arid area 3 2 1 the water carbon coupling relationship at hourly scale the positive correlations between hourly nee and et at different growth stages are shown in fig 3 generally the nonlinear fitting results based on eq 3 were better than the linear fitting result with larger coefficient of determination r2 except the maturity stage it indicated that the slope of nee et gradually decreased with the increase of et and the slope of nee et was influenced by vpd the parameters of the linear and nonlinear fittings differed for different stages table 1 the absolute value of parameter a decreased from the heading stage to the end and matched well with the maximum nee at each stage in 2017 and 2018 fig 3 parameter b reflected the increasing rate of the fitting slopes it was different for the two years but similar for the different stages in the same year though the linear slopes between nee and et in 2018 were smaller than that in 2017 nee reached its peak in 2018 earlier than in 2017 the diurnal dynamics of nee et and wue were similar at different growth stages fig 4 the average of nee at daytime was negative and et was positive du and liu 2013 wagle et al 2018 it is worth noting that nee reached the plateau ahead of et about 2 h in the morning especially at heading and filling stages this incomplete synchronous diurnal patterns of nee and et resulted in the rapid decrease of wue around noon the maximum wue appeared in the early morning and then wue showed a decline trend from the heading stage to the maturity stage in 2017 fig 4a c average daytime wue was 9 52 7 86 and 6 21 g co2 kg 1 h2o respectively from the jointing stage to the maturity stage in 2018 fig 4d g it was 8 57 9 43 7 91 and 4 65 g co2 kg 1 h2o respectively wue at the heading stage was the largest which was consistent with the result of winter wheat in the north china plain zhao et al 2007 3 2 2 the water carbon coupling relationship at daily scale the coupling of et and nee over maize field at daily scale showed a linear relationship in general for both years fig 5 and maize agroecosystem net absorbed 8 59 g co2 i e 2 34 g c when consumed 1 kg h2o per day which was a little larger than that of winter wheat 1 50 2 08 g c kg h2o in north china plain zhao et al 2007 wue in both years exhibited a similar seasonal variation specifically when maize quickly expanded at the jointing stage the function of carbon assimilation was improved on the other hand reduction of wue was evident during the maturity stage where leaves started to senesce the magnitude of daily wue reached around 15 g co2 kg 1 h2o in both years 3 3 the response of et and nee to the environmental factors 3 3 1 effects of meteorological conditions on hourly et and nee the correlation analyses in fig s2 indicated that both et and nee increased with the increase of par whereas neither et nor nee showed significant correlation with vpd or t the slopes of the relationship between et and par were always increasing with the increase in vpd and t ranges in both years fig 6 this illustrated that the maize et was not limited under the warming environmental condition with high water demand while the positive responses of nee par were much distinct the slopes between nee and par decreased with the increasing vpd which suggested that nee was limited by high vpd fig 6b and f this phenomenon occurred obviously when vpd exceeded 2 kpa in 2017 and 1 kpa in 2018 in addition when the range of t increased under same par condition fig 6d and h nee was also improved in 2017 or generally stable in 2018 our findings agreed well with that of pingintha et al 2010 who found that nee of a rainfed peanut field was suppressed under high vpd and high t during periods of water stress due to stomatal limitation of photosynthesis and higher ecosystem respiration so the relationship of et par and the relationship of nee par had opposite responses to the increase of vpd 3 3 2 effects of swc gc and meteorological factors on daily nee et and wue the influences of environmental factors on et nee and wue at daily scale are shown in fig 7 results indicated that both et and nee were positively correlated with swc gc and par gc representing crop stomatalcontrol was the most significant factor for explaining daily et and nee when par was around 700 μmol m 2 s 1 the small et and nee was limited by high vpd vpd seemed to have a limitation effect on the fluxes after vpd exceeding about 0 8 kpa under high vpd conditions maize tends to close their stomata which limits photosynthetic activities rigden et al 2020 even under irrigation condition the linear relationship between nee and et at daily scale fig 5 could be attributed to the similar sensitivities of nee and et in response to changing environmental drivers as a result the effects of swc gc and par on wue were insignificant vpd showed a slightly negative effect on wue during the middle growth season in both years thus the limitation of vpd on wue seemed to also exist at daily scale in this area the maximum wue in fig 7 occurred at the heading stage with the corresponding environmental conditions of high swc low vpd and gc of 8 8 mm s 1 3 3 3 effects of irrigations on the coupling of nee et the extra irrigation at the early stage in 2018 mainly increased soil evaporation instead of promoted crop photosynthesis and nee as maize cannot assimilate much co2 at that growth stage fig s4 comparing the nee et relationship before and after the first irrigation nee increased with constant et and the magnitude of increase was larger at higher constant et fig 8 during this period maize was at vigorous growth stage with lai 3 m2 m 2 fig s1 and high water demand wang et al 2020b the increased water availability after the irrigation effectively promoted net assimilation of co2 by consuming same amount of water while the distributions before and after the second irrigation were close suggesting that the irrigation had no significant effect on the coupling of nee et for the third irrigation the slope of the nee et curve even decreased a little the effects of the three irrigations on the coupling of nee et depended on crop growth stages fig 8 ineffective soil evaporation resulting from large irrigation could affect the relationship between et and nee but its effect was not the principal reason in this area since replacing et by maize transpiration tr the coupling of nee tr before and after irrigations was generally consistent with that of nee et fig s5 the optimal allocation of irrigation to improve wue would be complicated considering crop physiological characteristics at different growth stages 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal et nee and wue for both years the seasonal dynamics of et nee and wue for agroecosystem are closely related to crop characteristics and water conditions zhao et al 2007 the peak of nee was about 70 g co2 m 2 d 1 corresponding to 19 g c m 2 d 1 fig 2 which was larger than that of maize field in the north china plain and texas high plains 13 15 g c m 2 d 1 shen et al 2013 wagle et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 this could be explained by the condition of relatively sufficient soil water 0 3 m3 m 3 and net radiation 200 w m 2 or 17 3 mj m 2 day 1 in our study suyker et al 2004 wang et al 2020b swc and net radiation during maize growing season in the north china plain was generally smaller than 0 3 m3 m 3 without irrigation and 17 mj m 2 day 1 respectively shen et al 2013 swc and par in texas high plains was always smaller than 0 28 m3 m 3 and 750 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively wagle et al 2018 swc was relatively sufficient with the presence of shallow groundwater table depth and had a positive effect on et and nee fig 7 the maize growing season was shorter in the north china plain from early june to late september about 107 days and was similar in texas high plains from may 10 to middle october comparing with our study site besides the higher wue of maize comparing to winter wheat and soybean was demonstrated by the result of shen et al 2013 and suyker and verma 2010 wue nee et and wueyield yield et for two years at the study site were quantified the total observed et in 111 days during maize growing season was 557 2 mm in 2017 june 5 to sept 23 and was 453 8 mm in 2018 june 1 to sept 19 wang et al 2020b although the measured yield in 2018 14018 kg ha 1 was smaller than that in 2017 15910 kg ha 1 wueyield was 8 2 higher than 2017 similarly wue in 2018 2 10 g c kg 1 h2o was also higher than that in 2017 2 03 g c kg 1 h2o this suggested that the deeper wtd in 2018 than 2017 limited et and nee wang et al 2020b but increased wue wang et al 2020a the assessment of et gpp and wue for agroecosystems in the shiyang river basin of northwestern china indicates that through water saving irrigation practice et was reduced while wue could be increased kang et al 2000 tian and zhang 2020 larger dry biomass and nee accumulation of maize in 2017 consumed more water however it should be noted that the increasing rates 0 034 kg m 2 d 1 of grain biomass in two years were similar fig 2 this was attributed to larger proportion of stem and leaves dry biomass in 2017 fig 9 during the early growing period about 70 days after sowed only maize stem and leaves expanded thereafter grain began to accumulate while stem and leaves did not increase any more the larger expansion of stem and leaves in vegetative growth stage and the corresponding increased et did not significantly affect yield formation which could also decrease seasonal wue 4 2 wue explained by the coupling of hourly nee and et except the seasonal variation of wue over agroecosystems bai et al 2015 suyker and verma 2010 zhao et al 2007 a better understanding of wue at hourly scale is needed for precise irrigation crop water consumption and food security under climate warming condition in the future lin et al 2019 lobell et al 2013 the diurnal patterns of nee et and wue in fig 4 showed a decline trend of wue during daytime to better explore the hourly coupling of nee and et the diurnal dynamics were divided into two periods by 12 00 fig 10 the clockwise directions shown by the arrows at each period clearly illustrated that the diurnal dynamic of et lagged behind that of nee zhou et al 2014 this was consistent across all stages except for the maturity stage in 2018 the hysteresis here could be attributed to the hysteresis between et and par rather than the hysteresis between nee and par fig s3 the larger et in the afternoon under the same par resulted from the higher vpd in the afternoon lin et al 2019 besides with the increase in et during midday periods 12 00 15 00 nee did not increase accordingly at most stages fig 10 i e nee reached the plateau ahead of et fig 4 this phenomenon suggested that excessive et at midday time in arid areas would decrease wue which can becalled luxury et sinclair et al 2005 the hourly coupling of et and nee and decreased wue at midday time agreed with our previous inference that midday depression improves wue through comparing water productivity under different wtds wang et al 2020a we can make a unit conversion to connect excessive et threshold in this study and maize transpiration in wang et al 2020a if excessive et rate e g 15 mm d 1 from fig 10a at midday time was completely converted into maize transpiration rate according to the planting density 1 20 m2 plant 1 it is about 75 g h 1 the observed sap velocity at midday time under the shallower wtd average 1 6 m was mostly larger than this converted threshold please see fig 6 in wang et al 2020a thus excess transpiration had no significant positive effect on nee and yield accumulation the hourly coupling of water carbon fluxes better explains the reason for inefficient water use and strongly supports wue improvement under the relatively deeper wtd average about 2 m in arid areas the results could largely help improve irrigation and drainage regimes in arid areas with shallow water table depth 4 3 dominant effect of vpd on the coupling of nee and et the influence of the environmental factors on et and carbon fluxes were discussed in previous literature bai et al 2015 suyker and verma 2010 wagle et al 2018 while the responses of hourly fluxes over irrigated maize field have not been well examined par was the primary driver controlling daytime nee and et and its effect did not show light saturation fig 6 and fig s2 the positive relationship of nee par was similar in the morning and in the afternoon pingintha et al 2010 while a hysteresis was observed for et par fig s3 this was attributed to the opposite response of nee and et to vpd fig 6 resulting from the conjoint regulation of leaves stomata on photosynthesis and transpiration this coupling process was closely related to crop physiological responses instantaneous stomatal action to drought meteorological conditions lawson and vialet chabrand 2019 carbon flux was suggested to be affected by physiological controls more than h2o flux in response to increased t and vpd in an arid grassland wagle et al 2015 during midday time maize stomata were inhibited by high vpd resulting in constrained carbon flux while et relied on not only stomatal aperture but also vpd gradient the increased et suggested that the increasing effect of vpd on et was stronger than stomatal limitation at noon the effect of vpd on the coupling of water and carbon fluxes would be regulated by soil water availability stomatal behavior of maize in the u s corn belt was identified to be dominated by vpd over swc especially when vpd and swc were decoupled under high vpd and high swc situation kimm et al 2020 the dominant effect of vpd on stomatal behavior and the coupling of water and carbon fluxes would significantly affect agricultural production and irrigation management ort and long 2014 stressed the limit on future maize yield in united states by the increasing vpd and drought sensitivity rigden et al 2020 illustrated that daily average vpd beyond about 1 3 kpa was detrimental for maize yield in dry years vpd is predicted to increase in the future which may limit the future increase in maize yields without irrigation delucia et al 2019 besides the effect of vpd on carbon flux we also identified the effect of increasing vpd on et nee and wue of irrigated maize field in arid areas it was found that wue could decreased under high vpd breeding better drought tolerant crops and controlling water availability in a suitable range to limit et under drought condition are necessary to prevent inefficient crop water use 5 conclusions based on the measurements by ec system over irrigated maize field in arid areas the coupling of et and nee fluxes at different temporal scales and their responses to environmental factors were analyzed during two maize growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 the average daytime wue was the highest at heading stage the hourly coupling of nee et and their diurnal dynamics suggested that when et was increasing at midday time under high vpd nee did not increase resulting in the decline in wue this could be attributed to their opposite responses to the increasing vpd both nee and et had a significantly positive correlation with par however the slope of the linear relationship of et par increased with the increasing vpd from 0 to 3 3 kpa while the slope of the linear relationship of nee par decreased with vpd at daily scale the relationship between nee and et was generally linear which could be attributed to their similar sensitivities in response to the environmental factors the maize field net absorbed 8 59 g co2 when consumed 1 kg h2o per day during the growing season in addition the coupling of et and nee in responses to irrigations varied at different stages which was regulated by crop physiological activity better understanding the coupling of water and carbon fluxes and the influencing factors of irrigated cropland in arid areas provides valuable information for water resources management and food production under climate
