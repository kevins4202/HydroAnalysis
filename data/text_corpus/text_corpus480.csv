2400,exploring the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought and its potential influence factors is crucial for early warning of hydrological drought as a case study in the xijiang river basin xrb south china the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized runoff index sri series from 1961 to 2013 were used to represent the meteorological drought and hydrological drought with daily runoff generated by vic model an identification process for the threshold and the mechanism of drought propagation was conducted based on rank order analysis and copula theory the drought propagation regulations of drought variables geographical location and lag time were established by linear or non linear functions eventually the propagation regulations were applied to the hydrological drought prediction from 2021 to 2050 results indicated that 1 the spatial temporal patterns of meteorological drought are the critical factors in triggering drought propagation and the effects of meteorological drought area drought severity drought duration drought spatial concentration and drought persistent duration increase successively the critical threshold for triggering drought propagation is the combined frequency of the above five drought variables greater than 0 14 2 the geographic location center number duration severity and area of two drought types follow the linear two piecewise power linear and logarithmic functions respectively drought mainly propagation from west to east in three dimensional space and the lag time was less than three months with the maximum being 78 days unlike triggering drought propagation driving drought propagation is synthetically associated with meteorological soil water groundwater and topography conditions 3 under the mri esm2 0 model the severity and area of hydrological drought under different scenarios in the 2021 2050 will increase compared with the reference period 1961 2013 and the extreme hydrological drought exceeding history may occur under scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 the findings can help policy makers manage the early stages of hydrological drought based on meteorological drought conditions and thus reduce the negative impact of drought hazards keywords spi sri drought propagation drought prediction xijiang river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is one of the most damaging environmental disasters and has significant environmental economic and social impacts worldwide fang et al 2019 guo et al 2019 depending on the deficit of different hydrologic features drought is commonly divided into meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought alahacoon and edirisinghe 2022 the transmission of water deficit among different drought categories is called drought propagation gevaert et al 2018 bhardwaj et al 2020 meteorological drought caused by insufficient precipitation generally develops rapidly as the first stage and then the long term precipitation deficit leads to runoff and groundwater inadequately replenished yu et al 2020 ding et al 2021 li et al 2021b accompanied by water consumption such as evaporation and water intake the water storage is lower than average and eventually forms a hydrological drought generally it is relatively easy to assess meteorological droughts worldwide with readily available precipitation data records dutra et al 2014 huang et al 2015 spinoni et al 2019 however limited gauge runoff records hindered hydrological drought monitor therefore investigation of the propagation process from meteorological to hydrological drought and its potential influence factors has essential significance for establishing an effective monitoring and warning system of hydrological drought sattar and kim 2018 xu et al 2019 fang et al 2021 li et al 2021a lohpaisankrit and techamahasaranont 2021 currently research on drought propagation is mainly investigating the statistical relation between meteorological and hydrological drought indices by correlation analysis wavelet transform and mutual entropy etc junqueira et al 2020 yu et al 2020 ding et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 rose and chithra 2022 these researchers pointed out that drought propagation has the typical characteristics of pooling lag and lengthening shin et al 2018 sur et al 2020 lohpaisankrit and techamahasaranont 2021 wu et al 2022 the findings have improved our understanding of the relationship between long term drought index series however a disastrous drought is more of a random event with multi variable attributes and it seems more necessary to identify the propagation regulations and mechanisms between drought variables extracted from drought indices in this respect some studies focus on exploring the time lag and its potential influence factors on drought events edossa et al 2010 sattar et al 2019 liu et al 2020 meanwhile some research uses linear or nonlinear models to investigate the propagation regulations between drought numbers onset and terminal times duration area severity and return period zhu et al 2019 wu et al 2022 furtherly several researchers adopt probabilistic statistical methods e g conditional probability theory and bayesian model to understand drought propagation processes including response rate and response probability sattar et al 2019 nevertheless the results show that drought propagation has obvious regional regulation due to the climate background and the physical geographical characteristics sattar et al 2018 li et al 2020b yao et al 2020 meanwhile most studies are still limited by mainly revealing the propagation regulation from a statistical point of view and a knowledge gap still exists in driving factors and mechanisms of drought propagation li et al 2020b wang et al 2021 global warming has profoundly affected the energy balance and material cycle of the climate system and significantly changed the spatial temporal distribution patterns of meteorological and hydrological drought gu et al 2020 khan et al 2020 unlike meteorological and hydrological droughts are sensitive to climate warming the correlation between different drought types is relatively stable and does not change significantly in south china gu et al 2021 thus the hydrological drought can be predicted through meteorological drought information when the propagation regulations are revealed currently most pre existed researches focus on forecasting the spatial temporal patterns of meteorological drought based on different global climate model gcm sung et al 2020 lockart et al 2020 shiru et al 2020 das et al 2022 yet seldom forecasting the hydrological drought dynamics therefore it has a great application prospect to explore the hydrological drought characteristics under future scenarios based on drought propagation regulation the xijiang river is the longest river in the pearl river system which is the largest and most economically important river in south china fischer et al 2013 in the later part of the 20th century the basin experienced severe droughts with disaster area account about 5 of the total area in 1962 1963 niu et al 2015 and suffered continuous drought for nine years between 1984 and 1992 wu et al 2015 lin et al 2017 since the beginning of the 21st century extraordinarily severe and long lasting continuous droughts seem to have been frequent especially in 2004 2006 and 2010 2014 han et al 2021 taking the xijiang river basin as the study area the primary objectives of this study are 1 to reveal the mechanism and thresholds of triggering drought propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 2 to investigate the propagation regulations of drought variables three dimension locations and lag times and 3 to detect hydrological drought conditions based on drought propagation regulations in future climate scenarios 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the xijiang river basin in south china fig 1 flows through four provinces of yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong affecting the total water resource distribution in zhuhai and macau cities its catchment area is about 3 53 105 km2 and the average annual runoff at the outlet gaoyao station is approximately 2 2 1011 m3 the basin belongs to a sub tropical to tropical monsoon climate with the mean annual precipitation and runoff are 1447 mm and 668 6 mm for the period of 1952 2000 niu and chen 2010 respectively with the runoff ratio of 0 46 niu et al 2015 fischer et al 2013 although there is abundant precipitation over the basin the intra annual precipitation distribution is heterogeneous with non flood season precipitation generally accounting for only 20 to 40 of the annual rainfall niu 2013 meanwhile the fragile karst landforms with poor surface water retention capacity are distributed in the partial area resulting in drought events that frequently occur in the xrb 2 2 data preprocessing the meteorological datasets daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature at 34 gauging stations fig 1 within the xrb are retrieved from the national meteorological information center nmic at the china meteorological administration cma https data cma cn over the period from january 1 1961 through december 31 2013 meanwhile the dataset of 0 5 0 5 gridded precipitation in china version 2 0 from cma was used to calculate grid spi this dataset was developed using the thin plate spline method to grid the daily precipitation data of more than 2400 stations the dataset quality is strictly controlled the gridded precipitation was interpolated to 0 1 0 1 with kriging s method the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 is a new phase designed as a collaborative framework for gcms to improve knowledge of climate change meresa et al 2022 luo et al 2022 previous studies on the applicability evaluation of cmip6 climate models have shown that the mri esm2 0 model can reasonably simulate the meteorological data in southeast asia adjacent to xrb and global humid regions yazdandoost et al 2020 iqbal et al 2021 therefore seven scenario pattern comparison scenarios ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp4 3 4 ssp4 6 0 and ssp5 8 5 of the mri esm2 0 model were selected to predict daily precipitation 1 125 1 12 in this work similarly kriging s method was used to resample the precipitation dataset to 0 1 0 1 for the underlying surface the global 10 km soil profile dataset reynolds et al 2000 and global 1 km land cover classification dataset hansen et al 2000 were used to obtain the soil and vegetation parameters respectively measured daily streamflow including qianjiang guigang liuzhou and gaoyao stations water surface width velocity and other hydrological data mainly came from the water information center of the ministry of water resources of china the missing value percentages of in situ daily discharge records at four hydrological stations are 2 21 5 42 0 50 and 4 35 respectively the measured and the simulated streamflow from the hydrological model were assumed to have equal frequency on the same missing day then the value in the measured series with that frequency was chosen to insert 3 methodology 3 1 vic model in xrb the variable infiltration capacity vic model was developed by xu liang at the university of washington liang et al 1994 and later improved by lohmann et al 1998 and liang and xie 2001 it is a macro scale hydrological model based on a soil vegetationatmosphere transfer scheme svats notably it includes 1 both water balance and energy balance parameterization 2 two types of runoff yielding mechanisms based on saturation and infiltration excess 3 consideration of sun grid scale soil heterogeneity and 4 processes of snow accumulation and melt 5 soil freezing and thawing because it has a better physical mechanism and model struct wang et al 2012 the vic has been widely used all around the world to explicitly represent the spatial temporal sub grid scale variability of precipitation infiltration vegetation and soil on water fluxes throughout the landscape das et al 2018 srivastava et al 2020 according to our previous studies lin et al 2022 vic was run over a regional domain of 3417 grids at a spatial resolution of 10 km with a 24 h time step in the xrb for each grid the meteorological forcing data were generated by the inverse distance weighting method based on 34 meteorological stations main use calibrated hydrological parameters were calibrated with an auto optimization procedure based on rosenbrock 1960 under manual intervention the calibrated and validated vic can reasonably depict the characteristics of hydrological processes with the bias in five representative gauges varying from 4 12 and 1 02 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 ranges from 0 73 to 0 89 exceed 0 7 for more detailed parameter calibration and result verification information interested readers are referred to lin et al 2022 3 2 drought analysis 3 2 1 standardized drought indices for the meteorological drought characterization the standardized precipitation index spi initially proposed by mckee et al 1993 is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo it assumed that precipitation followed a probability distribution usually a gamma function and normalized it to indicate the precipitation deficits in a specific period since the spi has the advantages of simple calculation and multi scales 1 3 6 9 12 24 months it has been increasingly witnessed in the hydrological community for drought monitoring bazrafshan et al 2014 fang et al 2021 similarly the standardized runoff index sri was proposed by shukla and wood 2008 in reference to spi to describe the runoff deficit herein the log normal distribution is adopted for the sri calculation due to its good performance in the xrb wu et al 2015 lin et al 2017 standardized drought indices classify the drought as light drought 1 0 s p i s r i 0 5 moderate drought 1 5 s p i s r i 1 0 severe drought 2 0 s p i s r i 1 5 and extreme drought s p i s r i 2 0 since spi has multiple time scales selecting an appropriate scale to investigate drought propagation is necessary accordingly the correlations between drought variables extracted from spi n and sri were analyzed and the results were listed in table 1 in table 1 the 30 90 180 and 360 represent accumulation precipitation in the previous 30 90 180 and 360 days respectively the table shows that the simultaneous drought severity and area characterized by spi n and sri have the highest correlation among different lag time series among them drought variables monitored by spi 180 have the highest correlation with that of sri this conclusion is consistent with the correlation analysis results based on gauge streamflow in the nanpanjiang river sub basin zhang et al 2014 thus the spi 180 was selected to identify meteorological drought in this work 3 2 2 drought description this work mainly adopted six drought variables that identified with run theory herbst et al 1966 to describe drought spatial temporal dynamics including four widely used variables drought duration drought severity drought area and drought center drought duration d days refers to the period from a drought onset to end drought severity s spi sri represents the absolute accumulate amount of spi sri less than 0 5 during a drought event drought area a is the average proportion of grids in which daily spi sri is less than 0 5 during a drought event the drought center describes the drought location and transfer route in three dimensional space it is represented by the grid position of maximum drought severity in a certain period additionally two constructed variables of drought persistence degree and drought spatial concentration were used to descript the drought dynamic characteristics drought persistence degree pd refers to the average ratio of the total drought days and precipitation restoration numbers in grids drought spatial concentration sc is used to describe the uneven spatial distribution of drought expressed by the standard deviation of drought days in grids and then divided by 30 days a month to transfer into a dimensionless quantity 3 2 3 drought identification three thresholds of drought duration d c drought area a c and drought interval days τ c should be determined to identify regional drought the drought recognition process is as follows 1 the grid proportion of spi sri less than 0 5 per day is counted as the drought area a i 2 the number of consecutive days d with drought area a i greater than threshold a c was counted then a drought would form when d was greater than threshold d c 3 when the interval day τ of adjacent droughts is less than the threshold τ c the adjacent droughts are combined into one event referring to the previous work lin et al 2022 the recommended thresholds are d c 60 days a c 10 and τ c 5 days in the xrb under the threshold levels 56 and 53 meteorological and hydrological droughts were identified in the xrb from 1961 to 2013 respectively fig 2 3 2 4 drought event categories there are four corresponding relations between meteorological drought and hydrological drought according to whether they have a time overlap meteorological and hydrological compound drought type d1 meteorological drought occurs without triggering hydrological drought type d2 hydrological drought occurs without meteorological drought type d3 meteorological drought and hydrological drought independent occur type d4 additionally type d1 also contains three subtypes one meteorological drought corresponding to one hydrological drought one meteorological drought corresponding to multiple hydrological droughts and multiple meteorological droughts corresponding to one hydrological drought in the xrb the numbers of type d1 d2 and d3 were 37 19 and 2 and type d4 is temporarily unrecognizable in type d1 there were 25 of one meteorological drought events corresponding to one hydrological drought event 10 of one meteorological drought events corresponding to multiple hydrological drought events and 2 of multiple meteorological droughts corresponded to one hydrological drought see fig 2 3 3 copula function copula function was selected for fitting joint frequency of different drought variables it was first proposed by sklar 1959 based on connecting unary marginal distribution function with multivariate joint distribution function it has become essential for constructing multivariate joint distribution and analyzing the correlation structure among random variables as a critical category of the copula family archimedean copula is widely used to describe drought characteristics ayantobo et al 2018 fang et al 2020 based on our existed research wu et al 2015 the frank function of archimedean copula was applicable in the xrb so it was selected as the multivariate joint function and implemented the computation with the copula r package kojadinovic and yan 2010 he and zhu 2013 4 results 4 1 the impact factors and threshold for triggering drought propagation most meteorological droughts can cause hydrological droughts but some are not serious enough to trigger them in this work the influencing factors for triggering drought propagation were explored from the perspective of 19 independent meteorological droughts the key factors considered mainly include meteorological drought conditions pre soil moisture shortage pre groundwater deficit and geographical factors with reference to the spi the soil moisture shortage and groundwater deficit were represented by standardized soil moisture index ssi and standardized groundwater index sgi respectively in fig 3 the frequency ranks of potential factors for 19 independent meteorological droughts are indicated by color grids if an element significantly influences drought propagation its color grids will arrange collectively in front thus the effects of meteorological drought duration severity and area on triggering hydrological drought are from great to small however the maximum frequency rank of independent meteorological drought is still high rank 39 even when using the drought duration as the evaluation element by comparison two constructed drought variables drought spatial concentration and drought persistent duration significantly influence drought propagation more considerably than the above three traditional factors conversely the color grids of soil moisture and groundwater on pre n days have not shown consistent low frequency ranks indicating that soil and groundwater have a limited effect on triggering drought propagation meanwhile the color grids of the topographic factors such as elevation slope aspect latitude and longitude are more scattered suggesting that the topographic factors are also not the key influence factors of triggering drought propagation comprehensively the key factors triggering drought propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought were meteorological drought patterns the influence in descending order is drought persistent duration drought spatial concentration drought duration drought severity and drought area however drought propagation is usually influenced by multiple factors therefore the joint influence was detected with the copula function and the results are shown in fig 4 a the combination scenario of factors in fig 4 a is set according to their critical contribution the rank of the color marked grid shows that the combined frequency of five elements has the best effect than other combination scenarios and unique drought variables taking the maximum combined frequency of independent drought as the threshold the critical threshold for meteorological drought to trigger hydrological drought is 0 14 to verify the propagation threshold three typical sub basins yujiang guigang station liujiang liuzhou station and hongshuihe qianjiang station river basins were selected for validation in each sub basins 61 44 and 51 meteorological drought events were identified based on spi 180 therein the numbers of independent meteorological droughts are 21 17 and 17 respectively the joint frequencies of the drought variables were calculated with the copula function and the independent droughts were shown by color gird in fig 4 b we can see the color grids are ranked ahead indicating the multi factor joint frequency can better represent the independent meteorological drought in sub basins according to the triggering threshold of drought propagation the pseudo compound drought events were identified and corrected as independent meteorological drought and independent hydrological drought events fig 5 shows that after correction there were 30 compound droughts type d1 20 independent meteorological drought events type d2 2 independent hydrological drought events type d3 and 6 independent occurring meteorological and hydrological drought events type d4 in the xrb 4 2 drought propagation regulations and potential influence factors exploring the quantitative propagation regulations between drought variables duration severity and area is beneficial for forecasting the hydrological drought conditions in the future in table 2 the cross validation method was used to construct the propagation relationship models for 30 compound drought events by linear power and logarithmic functions respectively the optimal response relationship model of drought variables was determined according to the validation results for better comparison we split the data into three groups groups 1 to 3 used 1 10 11 20 and 21 30 drought events to verify the model and the remaining 20 drought events were taken to establish the model table 2 shows the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse values for fitting drought variables the location of the maximum cc and minimum rmse reveals the optimal fitting functions of drought duration drought severity drought area are power linear and logarithmic functions respectively for three variables group 2 consistently best fits with the lowest rmse therefore the optimal propagation model of drought duration is y 0 74 x 0 99 that of drought severity and drought area are y 0 89 x 125 33 and y 33 6 l n x 83 3 respectively the fitting functions and experience points are shown in fig 6 a c according to different potential influence factors the drought factors are divided into three groups and the average values of cc among each group were calculated fig 6 d shows that unlike triggering drought propagation meteorological soil moisture groundwater and geographical factors all have influence on driving drought propagation especially the soil moisture and groundwater among them elevation synchronism soil water shortage and spatial concentration of meteorological drought were the main factors affecting drought duration propagation and groundwater deficit also had a significant impact accumulated soil water shortage in pre 30 days accumulated groundwater deficit in pre 180 days and longitude were the major three factors affecting drought severity propagation similarly soil water shortage in pre 30 days and pre 90 days and longitude were the primary three factors affecting the drought area propagation comprehensively driving drought propagation is related to the complex influence of meteorological underlying surface and topography in addition to traditional drought variables the compound drought events may have a particular propagation relationship in geographical and dynamic patterns to this end the propagation regulation of the geographical average elevation latitude and longitude and the dynamic patterns migration route center numbers and lag time were also investigated and shown in fig 7 in fig 7 a c the average elevation latitude and longitude of compound drought showed a good linear relationship combined with box and whisker statistics in the figure the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in xrb presents the characteristics of spreading from high elevation latitude to low elevation latitude and from west to east on average the compound drought traveled 57 4 m vertically downward 3 5 km from north to south and 25 3 km from west to east therefore the compound drought propagation in the xrb is mainly west east direction fig 7 d e shows the migration route of drought centers in different development stages of meteorological drought and hydrological drought during 2009 2010 typical drought events it can be seen that hydrological drought obviously lags behind and the center numbers decreased affected by the runoff confluence path the migration trajectory of the two drought types is different but their overall direction is relatively consistent especially from june to september 2010 the migration trajectories of other 29 compound droughts were also analyzed but it was difficult to form a consistent response regulation on the contrary the center numbers seem to obey certain regulation fig 7 f shows there existed a logarithmic correlation between drought duration and the center number of meteorological droughts in fig 7 g we can see that the center number relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought comprises two parts when the center number of meteorological droughts is less than eight that of hydrological drought is between one and three when center numbers exceed eight it seems to have a logarithmic relationship between them fig 7 h shows the lag relationship between two drought types among 30 compound droughts 18 meteorological droughts occurred before the hydrological drought and the drought propagation time is less than three months with a maximum value is 78 days meanwhile 2 compound droughts occurred simultaneously and 10 hydrological droughts occurred earlier the advanced time of hydrological drought was within 15 days which may be caused by evaporation increase caused by higher temperature in an earlier period comprehensively although hydrological drought can occur earlier it generally occurs later than meteorological drought with 3 months 4 3 hydrological drought prediction based on propagation regulations based on precipitation data under different emission scenarios of the mri esm2 0 model the spi 180 was calculated to identify the meteorological drought events the results showed that 30 27 28 30 24 24 and 29 meteorological droughts occurred under ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp4 3 4 ssp4 6 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively in fig 8 a c the average duration of the meteorological drought was 188 0 192 5 206 7 213 0 233 4 252 1 and 203 7 days among them the duration of ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 increased compared with 214 6 days of the reference period 1961 2013 the average severities of meteorological drought were 901 2 963 6 861 4 879 4 912 7 953 1 and 908 6 spi all emission scenarios surpassed 831 9 spi of the reference periods the average areas of meteorological drought were 47 2 51 1 45 3 46 6 49 3 50 2 and 47 6 all exceed 39 4 of the reference period in fig 8 d e drought persistent durations were 46 6 47 5 48 7 50 1 47 2 55 5 and 47 8 days from low to high emissions all exceeding 43 4 days of the reference period the spatial concentration of meteorological drought was 1 55 1 54 1 63 1 49 1 78 1 92 and 1 58 respectively the ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 scenarios exceeded the baseline period value in general the meteorological drought severity will increase the scope will further expand and the persistence duration will prolong under different emission scenarios from 2021 to 2050 additionally the meteorological drought lasts longer and is more concentrated in spatial under ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 scenarios the copula function is used to calculate the joint frequency of drought concentration persistence duration severity and area taking the joint frequency greater than 0 14 as the triggering threshold the hydrological drought events under different scenarios from ssp1 1 9 to ssp5 8 5 are obtained fig 9 in fig 9 the numbers of meteorological droughts that can cause hydrological drought from low to high emissions are 16 15 14 17 13 9 and 16 thus the drought propagation rates are 53 3 55 6 50 0 56 7 54 2 37 5 and 55 2 respectively meteorological drought transmissibility is slightly higher under the ssp3 7 0 emission scenario according to the propagation regulation of drought duration drought severity and drought area the hydrological drought variables under different scenarios were deduced fig 10 in fig 10 a c the average duration of hydrological drought from low to high emission scenarios were 175 7 183 5 211 1 213 9 226 0 259 5 and 193 0 days respectively compared with the average duration of 222 1 days in the reference period the average duration in ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 increased yet other scenarios decreased similarly the average severities of hydrological drought were 1136 1 1144 8 1251 7 1104 3 1251 4 1310 3 and 1223 2 sri the average areas of hydrological drought were 49 5 53 2 52 0 50 2 50 2 53 5 53 6 and 51 8 respectively the drought severity and drought area in different scenarios all surpassed 1084 6 sri and 45 6 of the reference periods under the ssp4 6 0 emission scenario the occurrence frequency of hydrological drought was the lowest but the drought duration drought severity and drought area were relatively greater the maximum drought duration and drought area under different emission scenarios are 489 3 days and 63 7 both in ssp3 7 0 respectively which are smaller than 697 days and 67 2 of the reference period 1961 2013 thus there may not be extreme drought with duration and area exceeding the history in the future however the maximum drought severities under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios were 2332 4 2370 8 and 2379 2 sri respectively which exceeded the maximum value of 2217 sri in the reference period so that the hydrological drought exceeding the historical water shortage might occur in the future fig 10 d f shows the dynamic trend of hydrological drought variables under different scenarios the figure shows an increasing trend in the duration severity and area of hydrological drought in six scenarios except ssp4 6 0 therefore more serious hydrological drought events should be warned in the future 5 discussion 5 1 effects of climate and catchment properties on triggering and driving drought propagation the result of this work shows that triggering drought propagation majority depends on meteorological drought conditions that is meteorological conditions most of the present research revealed the propagation threshold based on run theory correlation analysis and non linear response methods wu et al 2021 the control conditions are only meteorological drought variables without considering the underlying surface and topography this work proved these methods have certain rationality notably the traditional variables of meteorological drought duration drought severity and drought area were not the most important influencing factors the impact of drought spatial concentration and drought persistent duration exceeded them are there any other meteorological drought morphological parameters affecting drought propagation new variables can be further explored under the method framework in this work different from triggering drought propagation driving drought propagation includes the comprehensive influence of soil water groundwater topography etc the role of soil water deserves attention for it accounts for a large proportion of annual precipitation he and chen 2013 indicate that the soil factors affecting hydrological drought are complex including relative soil roughness relative soil coverage relative soil humidity and soil type meanwhile there was a strong linear correlation between the effects of very fine grain fine grain and coarse grain on hydrological drought due to the data collection limitation and soil properties being complex in different watersheds there are still few studies in depth exploring the impact of soil properties on drought propagation the mechanism of soil affecting drought propagation needs to be further explored the elevation and topography do not directly affect the drought propagation but indirectly through precipitation soil water and groundwater specifically the elevation increases will lead to precipitation decrease and the high elevation mountain is not conducive to the entry of marine water vapor thereupon the weak alleviating effect of precipitation during drought events makes drought propagation faster and longer for the topography when the slope terrain and soil depth are great steep and shallow the alleviating effect for precipitation deficit is weak and the drought propagation is fast li et al 2020a if the groundwater level near the ridge is high the groundwater will rapidly replenish the soil water and provides evaporation after the occurrence of meteorological drought which makes the response of hydrological drought fast he et al 2018 it can be seen that drought propagation has regional characteristics causing hydrological drought prediction based on precipitation deficit in un gauged watersheds still facing challenges 5 2 the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought some studies proposed that the drought index sequence of hydrological drought lags behind meteorological drought based on time delay correlation and cross wavelet analysis yu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 this paper shows some differences in the results of time delay analyses with drought events rather than index sequences the difference is not a lag but a lead time from hydrological drought to meteorological drought in some compound drought events this indicates that hydrological drought may not always be driven by a precipitation deficit these could be for example a heat wave drought causing an increase in evapotranspiration mo and lettenmaier 2015 and reducing generated runoff despite a precipitation event sarah et al 2021 when drought propagation is a lag time however its duration is highly variable fig 7 h the wide range of values reflects the impact of factors aside from precipitation such as land cover soil type and initial conditions however the correlation coefficients between eighteen elements in fig 3 and propagation time are less than 0 4 thus no factor can independently affect the lag characteristic of drought propagation some studies have explored the propagation time and its influence mechanism they put forward that long lag times are likely due to the lack of dense vegetation cover accelerating desertification and increasing evaporation from the bare soil li et al 2017 patrick 2017 or due to the large scale atmospheric circulation anomaly such as enso and ao affect propagation through evaporation huang et al 2017 more complicated than that apparent seasonal differences confound homogeneous patterns in propagation time potopová et al 2019 peña gallardo et al 2019 therefore the influencing factors of lag time are complicated and the predict of propagation time is still difficult 5 3 future drought in the xrb in different emission scenarios the duration severity and extent of meteorological drought will increase and expand from 2021 to 2050 guo et al 2020 used precis regional climate model to simulate precipitation in the pearl river basin including the xrb and analyze the precipitation variation from 2021 to 2050 the result shows that precipitation in the study area is decreased with increasing volatility and the frequency of light rain will decrease meanwhile although the heavy rain will increase the precipitation area will be polarized precipitation may be only concentrated in a few significant precipitation processes which more easily cause flood and drought disasters the dynamics of meteorological drought in this paper are consistent with the results of guo et al 2020 which indicates that the scenario based meteorological drought prediction has certain rationality several pre existed studies have shown that the aridification trend is more obvious under high emission scenarios mo et al 2018 this work shows that the duration severity area of meteorological and hydrological drought and transfer rate of compound droughts are closely under different scenarios the drought factors in the low emission scenario even exceed those in the high emission scenario ssp5 8 5 indicating that when the carbon dioxide emission concentration is too high it may alleviate the attenuation trend of precipitation and reduce the drought in the ssp4 6 0 scenario although the wetting of precipitation effect was lower than the aridification effect of rising temperature it reduced the frequency of extreme drought in general six of the seven scenarios show that the xrb will face a broad drought trend in the first half of the 21st century hence adaptation and mitigation policies need to be formulated 5 4 limitation and extension in addition to the aspects mentioned above that require further study other parts also deserve attention the relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought is more complex in areas with strong human disturbance human beings have changed the evolution process of the water cycle through the development and utilization of water resources resulting in the reduction of surface water or underground water due to limited data collection this paper studied the drought propagation characteristics under natural conditions future research needs to embed human impact modules in hydrological models to consider propagation characteristics under the simultaneous effects of climate change and human activities meanwhile this work revealed the future drought characteristics in different scenarios of the mri esm2 0 model however other gcm models may provide different prediction results of regional precipitation and temperature leading to uncertainties in assessing drought dynamics under future climate scenarios it appears that the ensemble average and probability distribution investigation of multi model prediction needs to be carried out to compensate for the uncertainty of a single model and provide a more reliable forecast and risk warning for future climate change 6 conclusion it is essential to investigate the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought and its potential influence factors which not only helps reveal the drought process and regime but also helps develop a hydrological drought warning system based on meteorological drought information thus this study presented a helpful method to examine the regulation and mechanism for drought propagation with two standardized drought indices spi and sri and applied the propagation regulation to hydrological drought prediction in future scenarios the primary conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 meteorological and hydrological droughts in the xijiang river basin have a synchronous dynamic trend the meteorological drought conditions strongly triggered drought propagation and the influence of meteorological drought variables on drought propagation according to the descending order is drought persistent duration drought spatial concentration drought duration drought severity and drought area the critical threshold for triggering drought propagation can be described by the nonlinear function model when the combined frequency of meteorological drought persistent duration spatial concentration duration severity and area exceeds 0 14 then hydrological drought will be triggered 2 there is an apparent functional relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought variables the geographical position of meteorological and hydrological drought has a good linear association and drought is mainly propagated from east to west in three dimensional spatial the relation of drought center numbers can be represented by a piecewise function meanwhile the propagation regulation of drought duration drought severity and drought area can be represented by a power function linear function and logarithmic function respectively 3 the mechanism of driving drought propagation is complex elevation synchronism soil water shortage and spatial concentration of meteorological drought were the main factors affecting the propagation of drought duration meanwhile pre 30 days soil water shortage pre 180 days groundwater water deficit and longitude were the key factors influencing the propagation of drought severity in addition pre 30 days pre 90 days soil water shortages and longitude was the majority three factors affecting the propagation of drought area hydrological drought generally lags behind meteorological drought within three months but it may advance by half a month due to high temperature evaporation 4 the meteorological drought severity scope and persistence duration will increase under majority emission scenarios of mri esm2 0 from 2021 to 2050 under ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 scenarios drought duration will be longer and more concentrated in spatial more than half of meteorological droughts could trigger hydrological droughts and the drought transmissibility from low to high emissions are 53 3 55 6 50 0 56 7 54 2 37 5 and 55 2 respectively moreover the severity and area of hydrological drought will increase under all scenarios the extreme hydrological drought with the water deficit exceeding the reference period may occur under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios declaration of competing interest the

2400,exploring the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought and its potential influence factors is crucial for early warning of hydrological drought as a case study in the xijiang river basin xrb south china the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized runoff index sri series from 1961 to 2013 were used to represent the meteorological drought and hydrological drought with daily runoff generated by vic model an identification process for the threshold and the mechanism of drought propagation was conducted based on rank order analysis and copula theory the drought propagation regulations of drought variables geographical location and lag time were established by linear or non linear functions eventually the propagation regulations were applied to the hydrological drought prediction from 2021 to 2050 results indicated that 1 the spatial temporal patterns of meteorological drought are the critical factors in triggering drought propagation and the effects of meteorological drought area drought severity drought duration drought spatial concentration and drought persistent duration increase successively the critical threshold for triggering drought propagation is the combined frequency of the above five drought variables greater than 0 14 2 the geographic location center number duration severity and area of two drought types follow the linear two piecewise power linear and logarithmic functions respectively drought mainly propagation from west to east in three dimensional space and the lag time was less than three months with the maximum being 78 days unlike triggering drought propagation driving drought propagation is synthetically associated with meteorological soil water groundwater and topography conditions 3 under the mri esm2 0 model the severity and area of hydrological drought under different scenarios in the 2021 2050 will increase compared with the reference period 1961 2013 and the extreme hydrological drought exceeding history may occur under scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 the findings can help policy makers manage the early stages of hydrological drought based on meteorological drought conditions and thus reduce the negative impact of drought hazards keywords spi sri drought propagation drought prediction xijiang river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is one of the most damaging environmental disasters and has significant environmental economic and social impacts worldwide fang et al 2019 guo et al 2019 depending on the deficit of different hydrologic features drought is commonly divided into meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought alahacoon and edirisinghe 2022 the transmission of water deficit among different drought categories is called drought propagation gevaert et al 2018 bhardwaj et al 2020 meteorological drought caused by insufficient precipitation generally develops rapidly as the first stage and then the long term precipitation deficit leads to runoff and groundwater inadequately replenished yu et al 2020 ding et al 2021 li et al 2021b accompanied by water consumption such as evaporation and water intake the water storage is lower than average and eventually forms a hydrological drought generally it is relatively easy to assess meteorological droughts worldwide with readily available precipitation data records dutra et al 2014 huang et al 2015 spinoni et al 2019 however limited gauge runoff records hindered hydrological drought monitor therefore investigation of the propagation process from meteorological to hydrological drought and its potential influence factors has essential significance for establishing an effective monitoring and warning system of hydrological drought sattar and kim 2018 xu et al 2019 fang et al 2021 li et al 2021a lohpaisankrit and techamahasaranont 2021 currently research on drought propagation is mainly investigating the statistical relation between meteorological and hydrological drought indices by correlation analysis wavelet transform and mutual entropy etc junqueira et al 2020 yu et al 2020 ding et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 rose and chithra 2022 these researchers pointed out that drought propagation has the typical characteristics of pooling lag and lengthening shin et al 2018 sur et al 2020 lohpaisankrit and techamahasaranont 2021 wu et al 2022 the findings have improved our understanding of the relationship between long term drought index series however a disastrous drought is more of a random event with multi variable attributes and it seems more necessary to identify the propagation regulations and mechanisms between drought variables extracted from drought indices in this respect some studies focus on exploring the time lag and its potential influence factors on drought events edossa et al 2010 sattar et al 2019 liu et al 2020 meanwhile some research uses linear or nonlinear models to investigate the propagation regulations between drought numbers onset and terminal times duration area severity and return period zhu et al 2019 wu et al 2022 furtherly several researchers adopt probabilistic statistical methods e g conditional probability theory and bayesian model to understand drought propagation processes including response rate and response probability sattar et al 2019 nevertheless the results show that drought propagation has obvious regional regulation due to the climate background and the physical geographical characteristics sattar et al 2018 li et al 2020b yao et al 2020 meanwhile most studies are still limited by mainly revealing the propagation regulation from a statistical point of view and a knowledge gap still exists in driving factors and mechanisms of drought propagation li et al 2020b wang et al 2021 global warming has profoundly affected the energy balance and material cycle of the climate system and significantly changed the spatial temporal distribution patterns of meteorological and hydrological drought gu et al 2020 khan et al 2020 unlike meteorological and hydrological droughts are sensitive to climate warming the correlation between different drought types is relatively stable and does not change significantly in south china gu et al 2021 thus the hydrological drought can be predicted through meteorological drought information when the propagation regulations are revealed currently most pre existed researches focus on forecasting the spatial temporal patterns of meteorological drought based on different global climate model gcm sung et al 2020 lockart et al 2020 shiru et al 2020 das et al 2022 yet seldom forecasting the hydrological drought dynamics therefore it has a great application prospect to explore the hydrological drought characteristics under future scenarios based on drought propagation regulation the xijiang river is the longest river in the pearl river system which is the largest and most economically important river in south china fischer et al 2013 in the later part of the 20th century the basin experienced severe droughts with disaster area account about 5 of the total area in 1962 1963 niu et al 2015 and suffered continuous drought for nine years between 1984 and 1992 wu et al 2015 lin et al 2017 since the beginning of the 21st century extraordinarily severe and long lasting continuous droughts seem to have been frequent especially in 2004 2006 and 2010 2014 han et al 2021 taking the xijiang river basin as the study area the primary objectives of this study are 1 to reveal the mechanism and thresholds of triggering drought propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 2 to investigate the propagation regulations of drought variables three dimension locations and lag times and 3 to detect hydrological drought conditions based on drought propagation regulations in future climate scenarios 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the xijiang river basin in south china fig 1 flows through four provinces of yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong affecting the total water resource distribution in zhuhai and macau cities its catchment area is about 3 53 105 km2 and the average annual runoff at the outlet gaoyao station is approximately 2 2 1011 m3 the basin belongs to a sub tropical to tropical monsoon climate with the mean annual precipitation and runoff are 1447 mm and 668 6 mm for the period of 1952 2000 niu and chen 2010 respectively with the runoff ratio of 0 46 niu et al 2015 fischer et al 2013 although there is abundant precipitation over the basin the intra annual precipitation distribution is heterogeneous with non flood season precipitation generally accounting for only 20 to 40 of the annual rainfall niu 2013 meanwhile the fragile karst landforms with poor surface water retention capacity are distributed in the partial area resulting in drought events that frequently occur in the xrb 2 2 data preprocessing the meteorological datasets daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature at 34 gauging stations fig 1 within the xrb are retrieved from the national meteorological information center nmic at the china meteorological administration cma https data cma cn over the period from january 1 1961 through december 31 2013 meanwhile the dataset of 0 5 0 5 gridded precipitation in china version 2 0 from cma was used to calculate grid spi this dataset was developed using the thin plate spline method to grid the daily precipitation data of more than 2400 stations the dataset quality is strictly controlled the gridded precipitation was interpolated to 0 1 0 1 with kriging s method the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 is a new phase designed as a collaborative framework for gcms to improve knowledge of climate change meresa et al 2022 luo et al 2022 previous studies on the applicability evaluation of cmip6 climate models have shown that the mri esm2 0 model can reasonably simulate the meteorological data in southeast asia adjacent to xrb and global humid regions yazdandoost et al 2020 iqbal et al 2021 therefore seven scenario pattern comparison scenarios ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp4 3 4 ssp4 6 0 and ssp5 8 5 of the mri esm2 0 model were selected to predict daily precipitation 1 125 1 12 in this work similarly kriging s method was used to resample the precipitation dataset to 0 1 0 1 for the underlying surface the global 10 km soil profile dataset reynolds et al 2000 and global 1 km land cover classification dataset hansen et al 2000 were used to obtain the soil and vegetation parameters respectively measured daily streamflow including qianjiang guigang liuzhou and gaoyao stations water surface width velocity and other hydrological data mainly came from the water information center of the ministry of water resources of china the missing value percentages of in situ daily discharge records at four hydrological stations are 2 21 5 42 0 50 and 4 35 respectively the measured and the simulated streamflow from the hydrological model were assumed to have equal frequency on the same missing day then the value in the measured series with that frequency was chosen to insert 3 methodology 3 1 vic model in xrb the variable infiltration capacity vic model was developed by xu liang at the university of washington liang et al 1994 and later improved by lohmann et al 1998 and liang and xie 2001 it is a macro scale hydrological model based on a soil vegetationatmosphere transfer scheme svats notably it includes 1 both water balance and energy balance parameterization 2 two types of runoff yielding mechanisms based on saturation and infiltration excess 3 consideration of sun grid scale soil heterogeneity and 4 processes of snow accumulation and melt 5 soil freezing and thawing because it has a better physical mechanism and model struct wang et al 2012 the vic has been widely used all around the world to explicitly represent the spatial temporal sub grid scale variability of precipitation infiltration vegetation and soil on water fluxes throughout the landscape das et al 2018 srivastava et al 2020 according to our previous studies lin et al 2022 vic was run over a regional domain of 3417 grids at a spatial resolution of 10 km with a 24 h time step in the xrb for each grid the meteorological forcing data were generated by the inverse distance weighting method based on 34 meteorological stations main use calibrated hydrological parameters were calibrated with an auto optimization procedure based on rosenbrock 1960 under manual intervention the calibrated and validated vic can reasonably depict the characteristics of hydrological processes with the bias in five representative gauges varying from 4 12 and 1 02 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 ranges from 0 73 to 0 89 exceed 0 7 for more detailed parameter calibration and result verification information interested readers are referred to lin et al 2022 3 2 drought analysis 3 2 1 standardized drought indices for the meteorological drought characterization the standardized precipitation index spi initially proposed by mckee et al 1993 is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo it assumed that precipitation followed a probability distribution usually a gamma function and normalized it to indicate the precipitation deficits in a specific period since the spi has the advantages of simple calculation and multi scales 1 3 6 9 12 24 months it has been increasingly witnessed in the hydrological community for drought monitoring bazrafshan et al 2014 fang et al 2021 similarly the standardized runoff index sri was proposed by shukla and wood 2008 in reference to spi to describe the runoff deficit herein the log normal distribution is adopted for the sri calculation due to its good performance in the xrb wu et al 2015 lin et al 2017 standardized drought indices classify the drought as light drought 1 0 s p i s r i 0 5 moderate drought 1 5 s p i s r i 1 0 severe drought 2 0 s p i s r i 1 5 and extreme drought s p i s r i 2 0 since spi has multiple time scales selecting an appropriate scale to investigate drought propagation is necessary accordingly the correlations between drought variables extracted from spi n and sri were analyzed and the results were listed in table 1 in table 1 the 30 90 180 and 360 represent accumulation precipitation in the previous 30 90 180 and 360 days respectively the table shows that the simultaneous drought severity and area characterized by spi n and sri have the highest correlation among different lag time series among them drought variables monitored by spi 180 have the highest correlation with that of sri this conclusion is consistent with the correlation analysis results based on gauge streamflow in the nanpanjiang river sub basin zhang et al 2014 thus the spi 180 was selected to identify meteorological drought in this work 3 2 2 drought description this work mainly adopted six drought variables that identified with run theory herbst et al 1966 to describe drought spatial temporal dynamics including four widely used variables drought duration drought severity drought area and drought center drought duration d days refers to the period from a drought onset to end drought severity s spi sri represents the absolute accumulate amount of spi sri less than 0 5 during a drought event drought area a is the average proportion of grids in which daily spi sri is less than 0 5 during a drought event the drought center describes the drought location and transfer route in three dimensional space it is represented by the grid position of maximum drought severity in a certain period additionally two constructed variables of drought persistence degree and drought spatial concentration were used to descript the drought dynamic characteristics drought persistence degree pd refers to the average ratio of the total drought days and precipitation restoration numbers in grids drought spatial concentration sc is used to describe the uneven spatial distribution of drought expressed by the standard deviation of drought days in grids and then divided by 30 days a month to transfer into a dimensionless quantity 3 2 3 drought identification three thresholds of drought duration d c drought area a c and drought interval days τ c should be determined to identify regional drought the drought recognition process is as follows 1 the grid proportion of spi sri less than 0 5 per day is counted as the drought area a i 2 the number of consecutive days d with drought area a i greater than threshold a c was counted then a drought would form when d was greater than threshold d c 3 when the interval day τ of adjacent droughts is less than the threshold τ c the adjacent droughts are combined into one event referring to the previous work lin et al 2022 the recommended thresholds are d c 60 days a c 10 and τ c 5 days in the xrb under the threshold levels 56 and 53 meteorological and hydrological droughts were identified in the xrb from 1961 to 2013 respectively fig 2 3 2 4 drought event categories there are four corresponding relations between meteorological drought and hydrological drought according to whether they have a time overlap meteorological and hydrological compound drought type d1 meteorological drought occurs without triggering hydrological drought type d2 hydrological drought occurs without meteorological drought type d3 meteorological drought and hydrological drought independent occur type d4 additionally type d1 also contains three subtypes one meteorological drought corresponding to one hydrological drought one meteorological drought corresponding to multiple hydrological droughts and multiple meteorological droughts corresponding to one hydrological drought in the xrb the numbers of type d1 d2 and d3 were 37 19 and 2 and type d4 is temporarily unrecognizable in type d1 there were 25 of one meteorological drought events corresponding to one hydrological drought event 10 of one meteorological drought events corresponding to multiple hydrological drought events and 2 of multiple meteorological droughts corresponded to one hydrological drought see fig 2 3 3 copula function copula function was selected for fitting joint frequency of different drought variables it was first proposed by sklar 1959 based on connecting unary marginal distribution function with multivariate joint distribution function it has become essential for constructing multivariate joint distribution and analyzing the correlation structure among random variables as a critical category of the copula family archimedean copula is widely used to describe drought characteristics ayantobo et al 2018 fang et al 2020 based on our existed research wu et al 2015 the frank function of archimedean copula was applicable in the xrb so it was selected as the multivariate joint function and implemented the computation with the copula r package kojadinovic and yan 2010 he and zhu 2013 4 results 4 1 the impact factors and threshold for triggering drought propagation most meteorological droughts can cause hydrological droughts but some are not serious enough to trigger them in this work the influencing factors for triggering drought propagation were explored from the perspective of 19 independent meteorological droughts the key factors considered mainly include meteorological drought conditions pre soil moisture shortage pre groundwater deficit and geographical factors with reference to the spi the soil moisture shortage and groundwater deficit were represented by standardized soil moisture index ssi and standardized groundwater index sgi respectively in fig 3 the frequency ranks of potential factors for 19 independent meteorological droughts are indicated by color grids if an element significantly influences drought propagation its color grids will arrange collectively in front thus the effects of meteorological drought duration severity and area on triggering hydrological drought are from great to small however the maximum frequency rank of independent meteorological drought is still high rank 39 even when using the drought duration as the evaluation element by comparison two constructed drought variables drought spatial concentration and drought persistent duration significantly influence drought propagation more considerably than the above three traditional factors conversely the color grids of soil moisture and groundwater on pre n days have not shown consistent low frequency ranks indicating that soil and groundwater have a limited effect on triggering drought propagation meanwhile the color grids of the topographic factors such as elevation slope aspect latitude and longitude are more scattered suggesting that the topographic factors are also not the key influence factors of triggering drought propagation comprehensively the key factors triggering drought propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought were meteorological drought patterns the influence in descending order is drought persistent duration drought spatial concentration drought duration drought severity and drought area however drought propagation is usually influenced by multiple factors therefore the joint influence was detected with the copula function and the results are shown in fig 4 a the combination scenario of factors in fig 4 a is set according to their critical contribution the rank of the color marked grid shows that the combined frequency of five elements has the best effect than other combination scenarios and unique drought variables taking the maximum combined frequency of independent drought as the threshold the critical threshold for meteorological drought to trigger hydrological drought is 0 14 to verify the propagation threshold three typical sub basins yujiang guigang station liujiang liuzhou station and hongshuihe qianjiang station river basins were selected for validation in each sub basins 61 44 and 51 meteorological drought events were identified based on spi 180 therein the numbers of independent meteorological droughts are 21 17 and 17 respectively the joint frequencies of the drought variables were calculated with the copula function and the independent droughts were shown by color gird in fig 4 b we can see the color grids are ranked ahead indicating the multi factor joint frequency can better represent the independent meteorological drought in sub basins according to the triggering threshold of drought propagation the pseudo compound drought events were identified and corrected as independent meteorological drought and independent hydrological drought events fig 5 shows that after correction there were 30 compound droughts type d1 20 independent meteorological drought events type d2 2 independent hydrological drought events type d3 and 6 independent occurring meteorological and hydrological drought events type d4 in the xrb 4 2 drought propagation regulations and potential influence factors exploring the quantitative propagation regulations between drought variables duration severity and area is beneficial for forecasting the hydrological drought conditions in the future in table 2 the cross validation method was used to construct the propagation relationship models for 30 compound drought events by linear power and logarithmic functions respectively the optimal response relationship model of drought variables was determined according to the validation results for better comparison we split the data into three groups groups 1 to 3 used 1 10 11 20 and 21 30 drought events to verify the model and the remaining 20 drought events were taken to establish the model table 2 shows the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse values for fitting drought variables the location of the maximum cc and minimum rmse reveals the optimal fitting functions of drought duration drought severity drought area are power linear and logarithmic functions respectively for three variables group 2 consistently best fits with the lowest rmse therefore the optimal propagation model of drought duration is y 0 74 x 0 99 that of drought severity and drought area are y 0 89 x 125 33 and y 33 6 l n x 83 3 respectively the fitting functions and experience points are shown in fig 6 a c according to different potential influence factors the drought factors are divided into three groups and the average values of cc among each group were calculated fig 6 d shows that unlike triggering drought propagation meteorological soil moisture groundwater and geographical factors all have influence on driving drought propagation especially the soil moisture and groundwater among them elevation synchronism soil water shortage and spatial concentration of meteorological drought were the main factors affecting drought duration propagation and groundwater deficit also had a significant impact accumulated soil water shortage in pre 30 days accumulated groundwater deficit in pre 180 days and longitude were the major three factors affecting drought severity propagation similarly soil water shortage in pre 30 days and pre 90 days and longitude were the primary three factors affecting the drought area propagation comprehensively driving drought propagation is related to the complex influence of meteorological underlying surface and topography in addition to traditional drought variables the compound drought events may have a particular propagation relationship in geographical and dynamic patterns to this end the propagation regulation of the geographical average elevation latitude and longitude and the dynamic patterns migration route center numbers and lag time were also investigated and shown in fig 7 in fig 7 a c the average elevation latitude and longitude of compound drought showed a good linear relationship combined with box and whisker statistics in the figure the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in xrb presents the characteristics of spreading from high elevation latitude to low elevation latitude and from west to east on average the compound drought traveled 57 4 m vertically downward 3 5 km from north to south and 25 3 km from west to east therefore the compound drought propagation in the xrb is mainly west east direction fig 7 d e shows the migration route of drought centers in different development stages of meteorological drought and hydrological drought during 2009 2010 typical drought events it can be seen that hydrological drought obviously lags behind and the center numbers decreased affected by the runoff confluence path the migration trajectory of the two drought types is different but their overall direction is relatively consistent especially from june to september 2010 the migration trajectories of other 29 compound droughts were also analyzed but it was difficult to form a consistent response regulation on the contrary the center numbers seem to obey certain regulation fig 7 f shows there existed a logarithmic correlation between drought duration and the center number of meteorological droughts in fig 7 g we can see that the center number relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought comprises two parts when the center number of meteorological droughts is less than eight that of hydrological drought is between one and three when center numbers exceed eight it seems to have a logarithmic relationship between them fig 7 h shows the lag relationship between two drought types among 30 compound droughts 18 meteorological droughts occurred before the hydrological drought and the drought propagation time is less than three months with a maximum value is 78 days meanwhile 2 compound droughts occurred simultaneously and 10 hydrological droughts occurred earlier the advanced time of hydrological drought was within 15 days which may be caused by evaporation increase caused by higher temperature in an earlier period comprehensively although hydrological drought can occur earlier it generally occurs later than meteorological drought with 3 months 4 3 hydrological drought prediction based on propagation regulations based on precipitation data under different emission scenarios of the mri esm2 0 model the spi 180 was calculated to identify the meteorological drought events the results showed that 30 27 28 30 24 24 and 29 meteorological droughts occurred under ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp4 3 4 ssp4 6 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively in fig 8 a c the average duration of the meteorological drought was 188 0 192 5 206 7 213 0 233 4 252 1 and 203 7 days among them the duration of ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 increased compared with 214 6 days of the reference period 1961 2013 the average severities of meteorological drought were 901 2 963 6 861 4 879 4 912 7 953 1 and 908 6 spi all emission scenarios surpassed 831 9 spi of the reference periods the average areas of meteorological drought were 47 2 51 1 45 3 46 6 49 3 50 2 and 47 6 all exceed 39 4 of the reference period in fig 8 d e drought persistent durations were 46 6 47 5 48 7 50 1 47 2 55 5 and 47 8 days from low to high emissions all exceeding 43 4 days of the reference period the spatial concentration of meteorological drought was 1 55 1 54 1 63 1 49 1 78 1 92 and 1 58 respectively the ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 scenarios exceeded the baseline period value in general the meteorological drought severity will increase the scope will further expand and the persistence duration will prolong under different emission scenarios from 2021 to 2050 additionally the meteorological drought lasts longer and is more concentrated in spatial under ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 scenarios the copula function is used to calculate the joint frequency of drought concentration persistence duration severity and area taking the joint frequency greater than 0 14 as the triggering threshold the hydrological drought events under different scenarios from ssp1 1 9 to ssp5 8 5 are obtained fig 9 in fig 9 the numbers of meteorological droughts that can cause hydrological drought from low to high emissions are 16 15 14 17 13 9 and 16 thus the drought propagation rates are 53 3 55 6 50 0 56 7 54 2 37 5 and 55 2 respectively meteorological drought transmissibility is slightly higher under the ssp3 7 0 emission scenario according to the propagation regulation of drought duration drought severity and drought area the hydrological drought variables under different scenarios were deduced fig 10 in fig 10 a c the average duration of hydrological drought from low to high emission scenarios were 175 7 183 5 211 1 213 9 226 0 259 5 and 193 0 days respectively compared with the average duration of 222 1 days in the reference period the average duration in ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 increased yet other scenarios decreased similarly the average severities of hydrological drought were 1136 1 1144 8 1251 7 1104 3 1251 4 1310 3 and 1223 2 sri the average areas of hydrological drought were 49 5 53 2 52 0 50 2 50 2 53 5 53 6 and 51 8 respectively the drought severity and drought area in different scenarios all surpassed 1084 6 sri and 45 6 of the reference periods under the ssp4 6 0 emission scenario the occurrence frequency of hydrological drought was the lowest but the drought duration drought severity and drought area were relatively greater the maximum drought duration and drought area under different emission scenarios are 489 3 days and 63 7 both in ssp3 7 0 respectively which are smaller than 697 days and 67 2 of the reference period 1961 2013 thus there may not be extreme drought with duration and area exceeding the history in the future however the maximum drought severities under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios were 2332 4 2370 8 and 2379 2 sri respectively which exceeded the maximum value of 2217 sri in the reference period so that the hydrological drought exceeding the historical water shortage might occur in the future fig 10 d f shows the dynamic trend of hydrological drought variables under different scenarios the figure shows an increasing trend in the duration severity and area of hydrological drought in six scenarios except ssp4 6 0 therefore more serious hydrological drought events should be warned in the future 5 discussion 5 1 effects of climate and catchment properties on triggering and driving drought propagation the result of this work shows that triggering drought propagation majority depends on meteorological drought conditions that is meteorological conditions most of the present research revealed the propagation threshold based on run theory correlation analysis and non linear response methods wu et al 2021 the control conditions are only meteorological drought variables without considering the underlying surface and topography this work proved these methods have certain rationality notably the traditional variables of meteorological drought duration drought severity and drought area were not the most important influencing factors the impact of drought spatial concentration and drought persistent duration exceeded them are there any other meteorological drought morphological parameters affecting drought propagation new variables can be further explored under the method framework in this work different from triggering drought propagation driving drought propagation includes the comprehensive influence of soil water groundwater topography etc the role of soil water deserves attention for it accounts for a large proportion of annual precipitation he and chen 2013 indicate that the soil factors affecting hydrological drought are complex including relative soil roughness relative soil coverage relative soil humidity and soil type meanwhile there was a strong linear correlation between the effects of very fine grain fine grain and coarse grain on hydrological drought due to the data collection limitation and soil properties being complex in different watersheds there are still few studies in depth exploring the impact of soil properties on drought propagation the mechanism of soil affecting drought propagation needs to be further explored the elevation and topography do not directly affect the drought propagation but indirectly through precipitation soil water and groundwater specifically the elevation increases will lead to precipitation decrease and the high elevation mountain is not conducive to the entry of marine water vapor thereupon the weak alleviating effect of precipitation during drought events makes drought propagation faster and longer for the topography when the slope terrain and soil depth are great steep and shallow the alleviating effect for precipitation deficit is weak and the drought propagation is fast li et al 2020a if the groundwater level near the ridge is high the groundwater will rapidly replenish the soil water and provides evaporation after the occurrence of meteorological drought which makes the response of hydrological drought fast he et al 2018 it can be seen that drought propagation has regional characteristics causing hydrological drought prediction based on precipitation deficit in un gauged watersheds still facing challenges 5 2 the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought some studies proposed that the drought index sequence of hydrological drought lags behind meteorological drought based on time delay correlation and cross wavelet analysis yu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 this paper shows some differences in the results of time delay analyses with drought events rather than index sequences the difference is not a lag but a lead time from hydrological drought to meteorological drought in some compound drought events this indicates that hydrological drought may not always be driven by a precipitation deficit these could be for example a heat wave drought causing an increase in evapotranspiration mo and lettenmaier 2015 and reducing generated runoff despite a precipitation event sarah et al 2021 when drought propagation is a lag time however its duration is highly variable fig 7 h the wide range of values reflects the impact of factors aside from precipitation such as land cover soil type and initial conditions however the correlation coefficients between eighteen elements in fig 3 and propagation time are less than 0 4 thus no factor can independently affect the lag characteristic of drought propagation some studies have explored the propagation time and its influence mechanism they put forward that long lag times are likely due to the lack of dense vegetation cover accelerating desertification and increasing evaporation from the bare soil li et al 2017 patrick 2017 or due to the large scale atmospheric circulation anomaly such as enso and ao affect propagation through evaporation huang et al 2017 more complicated than that apparent seasonal differences confound homogeneous patterns in propagation time potopová et al 2019 peña gallardo et al 2019 therefore the influencing factors of lag time are complicated and the predict of propagation time is still difficult 5 3 future drought in the xrb in different emission scenarios the duration severity and extent of meteorological drought will increase and expand from 2021 to 2050 guo et al 2020 used precis regional climate model to simulate precipitation in the pearl river basin including the xrb and analyze the precipitation variation from 2021 to 2050 the result shows that precipitation in the study area is decreased with increasing volatility and the frequency of light rain will decrease meanwhile although the heavy rain will increase the precipitation area will be polarized precipitation may be only concentrated in a few significant precipitation processes which more easily cause flood and drought disasters the dynamics of meteorological drought in this paper are consistent with the results of guo et al 2020 which indicates that the scenario based meteorological drought prediction has certain rationality several pre existed studies have shown that the aridification trend is more obvious under high emission scenarios mo et al 2018 this work shows that the duration severity area of meteorological and hydrological drought and transfer rate of compound droughts are closely under different scenarios the drought factors in the low emission scenario even exceed those in the high emission scenario ssp5 8 5 indicating that when the carbon dioxide emission concentration is too high it may alleviate the attenuation trend of precipitation and reduce the drought in the ssp4 6 0 scenario although the wetting of precipitation effect was lower than the aridification effect of rising temperature it reduced the frequency of extreme drought in general six of the seven scenarios show that the xrb will face a broad drought trend in the first half of the 21st century hence adaptation and mitigation policies need to be formulated 5 4 limitation and extension in addition to the aspects mentioned above that require further study other parts also deserve attention the relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought is more complex in areas with strong human disturbance human beings have changed the evolution process of the water cycle through the development and utilization of water resources resulting in the reduction of surface water or underground water due to limited data collection this paper studied the drought propagation characteristics under natural conditions future research needs to embed human impact modules in hydrological models to consider propagation characteristics under the simultaneous effects of climate change and human activities meanwhile this work revealed the future drought characteristics in different scenarios of the mri esm2 0 model however other gcm models may provide different prediction results of regional precipitation and temperature leading to uncertainties in assessing drought dynamics under future climate scenarios it appears that the ensemble average and probability distribution investigation of multi model prediction needs to be carried out to compensate for the uncertainty of a single model and provide a more reliable forecast and risk warning for future climate change 6 conclusion it is essential to investigate the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought and its potential influence factors which not only helps reveal the drought process and regime but also helps develop a hydrological drought warning system based on meteorological drought information thus this study presented a helpful method to examine the regulation and mechanism for drought propagation with two standardized drought indices spi and sri and applied the propagation regulation to hydrological drought prediction in future scenarios the primary conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 meteorological and hydrological droughts in the xijiang river basin have a synchronous dynamic trend the meteorological drought conditions strongly triggered drought propagation and the influence of meteorological drought variables on drought propagation according to the descending order is drought persistent duration drought spatial concentration drought duration drought severity and drought area the critical threshold for triggering drought propagation can be described by the nonlinear function model when the combined frequency of meteorological drought persistent duration spatial concentration duration severity and area exceeds 0 14 then hydrological drought will be triggered 2 there is an apparent functional relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought variables the geographical position of meteorological and hydrological drought has a good linear association and drought is mainly propagated from east to west in three dimensional spatial the relation of drought center numbers can be represented by a piecewise function meanwhile the propagation regulation of drought duration drought severity and drought area can be represented by a power function linear function and logarithmic function respectively 3 the mechanism of driving drought propagation is complex elevation synchronism soil water shortage and spatial concentration of meteorological drought were the main factors affecting the propagation of drought duration meanwhile pre 30 days soil water shortage pre 180 days groundwater water deficit and longitude were the key factors influencing the propagation of drought severity in addition pre 30 days pre 90 days soil water shortages and longitude was the majority three factors affecting the propagation of drought area hydrological drought generally lags behind meteorological drought within three months but it may advance by half a month due to high temperature evaporation 4 the meteorological drought severity scope and persistence duration will increase under majority emission scenarios of mri esm2 0 from 2021 to 2050 under ssp4 3 4 and ssp4 6 0 scenarios drought duration will be longer and more concentrated in spatial more than half of meteorological droughts could trigger hydrological droughts and the drought transmissibility from low to high emissions are 53 3 55 6 50 0 56 7 54 2 37 5 and 55 2 respectively moreover the severity and area of hydrological drought will increase under all scenarios the extreme hydrological drought with the water deficit exceeding the reference period may occur under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios declaration of competing interest the

2401,understanding the impact of wildfires on soils exposed to fire is critical especially in the current climate scenario where an increase in the occurrence of wildfires is expected near surface soil physical properties are affected by temperature increases caused by wildfires therefore changes in the soil water retention curve swrc are expected parameters describing the swrc can be obtained either by measuring or deriving using pedotransfer functions ptf however ptfs have been developed using data from agricultural soils without major heating events therefore it is uncertain whether the estimation of parameters in fire affected soils is reliable this study evaluated changes in the hydraulic properties of near surface soil due to fire during three wildfire events of different magnitudes the objectives were a to identify changes in soil properties and swrc due to wildfires b to assess the ptf performance rosetta versions 1 2 and 3 of non affected and fire affected soils and

entire range of suctions although it did not accurately estimate θs or ksat among rosetta s estimations ksat showed the highest variations which were more marked in fire affected soils when measured values were 15 85 cm d 1 while those estimated were 79 14 cm d 1 on average the implications for hydrologic modelling were translated into lower annual water content and higher infiltration when using rosetta inputs compared to inputs based on the measured swrc keywords burnt soils pyrohydrology soil post fire soil water retention curve wildfires data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wildfires can affect soil hydraulic properties resulting in reduced infiltration and organic matter om loss moody et al 2016 the om consumption has impacts on bulk density bd and water storage capacity which tend to increase and decrease in response to high temperatures respectively ebel 2012 in addition the hydrophobicity induced by wildfires can generate temporary changes in the hydraulic properties of soils jiménez morillo et al 2022 changes in soil hydraulic properties trigger shifts in hydrologic processes including infiltration runoff and deep percolation ebel 2013 therefore proper water flow modelling in soils affected by wildfires is important filipović et al 2019 the soil water retention curve swrc is a critical input for modelling the soil moisture dynamics soil plant water relationships and water balance when the richards equation is used ebel 2012 matula et al 2008 swrc shifts have been reported at various severities of fire events however results from previous studies are contradictory at higher temperatures stoof et al 2010 demonstrated that the presence of ash did not alter soil texture but increased water retention chen et al 2020 found lower water content in non affected soil than in fire affected soil with the soil water content negatively correlated with water repellency in contrast according to ebel and moody 2020 the primary effect of wildlife on swrc corresponds to a significant decrease in saturated soil water content θs geographically broad soil sampling may help address the variability of changes in the swrc due to wildfires however proper soil sampling and measurement of soil hydraulic properties are time consuming labor intensive and expensive wösten et al 2001 indeed after a wildfire event collecting homogeneous post wildfire soil for large scale experiments is nearly impossible movasat and tomac 2021 using pedotransfer functions ptfs which are empirical relationships between soil hydraulics and easily measurable properties may reduce the time and effort required for water flow modelling among the ptfs for estimating the parameters for the swrc rosetta is emphasized because of its reliable results baker and ellison 2008 several studies have underscored the advantages of rosetta over regression analysis in estimating these parameters highlighting its performance and reliability schaap et al 2001 however as most ptfs rosetta seem to have been developed from soils under conventional agriculture or wildlands cueff et al 2021 shuster et al 2021 wösten et al 2001 and the available ptfs have not yet been evaluated with respect to unburned and fire affected soils the inconsistent evidence on how the swrc behaves after a wildfire leads us to hypothesize that if a ptf such as rosetta is limited to the sample data on which it was built it could be inaccurate for estimating curves after wildfire events the aims of this study were to a identify changes in basic soil properties and the swrc as a result of wildfires b assess ptf performance in unburned soils affected by wildfires and c evaluate changes in the swrc due to wildfires and subsequent water flow behavior changes through modelling 2 materials and methods 2 1 measuring soil properties three soils affected by wildfires were sampled at a depth of 0 10 cm one five months after the wildfire event hereafter referred to as fire affected soils soil samples were collected from the topsoils of natural wildfires in chile s central and southern regions 33 s to 36 s where wildfires occurred between 2019 and 2020 fire affected soil samples were collected near surface soil during three fire events moderately severe a moderately severe b and highly severe categorized according to martínez et al 2022 baseline samples were collected from neighboring unburned areas named unaffected soils based on the methodology proposed by varela et al 2015 in both moderately severe events non woody vegetation was consumed whereas in the highly severe event all vegetation was consumed and a layer of gray ash was observed fig 1 the sand silt and clay fractions were determined using the hydrometer method following om removal acevedo et al 2021 the om was measured by oxidation using a mixture of dichromate and sulfuric acid ph was measured using the standard method for chilean soils in a 1 2 5 ratio sadzawka et al 2006 except for soil texture n 1 average intriplicate measurementsfor eachsoil sample were performed for om and ph to obtain the soil hydraulic properties swrc and ksat undisturbed samples cores were collected at each site using 250 cm3 sampling rings and then refrigerated 4 c until analysis the soil rings were then saturated according to their soil texture and electrical conductivity once saturation was reached the saturated soil core was carefully placed in a ksat device meter and kept saturated by passing a cacl2 solution the falling head method was then selected based on the soil texture not clayey soils the swrc was then measured using a hyprop device meter group pullman wa usa the measurements water loss in the soil core vs time were recorded until the suction values from both tensiometers were close to zero after the hyprop measurement the soil core was sliced into four layers and each layer was measured using a wp4c dewpoint potentiometer acevedo et al 2020 kirste et al 2019 to obtain a moisture gradient through the soil core the final water content and bd of the soil core were measured after oven drying at 105 c except for ksat n 1 average induplicate measurementsfor eachsoil sample were performed for bd and swrc 2 2 water flow modelling using hydrus 1 d after obtaining the swrc data point measurements the curves were fitted to van genuchten parameters using the soilhyp r package dettmann 2019 using the fitshp function the parameters for the unimodal van genuchten model saturated θs residual θr n unitless alpha 1 cm 1 and ksat were estimated using rosetta version 1 2 and 3 schaap et al 2001 2004 zhang and schaap 2017 based on sand silt and clay contents field capacity and bd after obtaining the soil hydraulic properties using ptf rosetta or measurements a one year climatic scenario using hydrus 1d software was performed for both the fire affected and non affected soils hydrus 1d solves richard s equation using the finite element method šimůnek et al 2008 for the one year simulation meteorological data from nearby meteorological stations were used as the model inputs the surface boundary condition was an atmospheric boundary with surface runoff šimůnek and genuchten 2008 parameterized with the reported daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which were calculated using the net radiation air temperatures minimum and maximum relative humidity and wind speed the bottom boundary had free drainage the simulated soil dominion was 20 cm long where the first 5 cm corresponded to the topsoil fire affected and non affected soil and the remaining 15 cm corresponded to loamy soil the observation point was located at a depth of 2 5 cm a shallow dominion was selected because for loamy and sandy soils hydrus 1d have been recommended as a reasonable method to estimate soil water content holländer et al 2016 2 3 data analysis and statistics to compare the fitting between the swrc measurements and ptf estimates the root mean squared error rmse was computed as follows eq 1 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i o i 2 where e i and o i are the ith estimated and observed water content value and n is the number of observations respectively the coefficient of variation cv 100 standard deviation mean was used as a measure the degree of variation between measurements replicates the following statistical analyses and r packages were used tidyverse wickham et al 2019 and ggplot2 wickham 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in soil properties due to wildfires fig 2 shows the basic soil properties sampled at 0 10 cm and ksat and bd measurements from soil cores at 0 5 cm depth for the non affected and fire affected soils at the three wildfire events the sampling depth were selected based on previous studies stating that changes in soil properties after wildfires rarely exceed 10 cm agbeshie et al 2022 wieting et al 2017 carter and gregorich 2007 proposed that cv of soil properties can be categorized into low 15 moderate 15 35 high 35 75 and very high 75 variability excepting for soil texture ph and om measurements from disturbed samples showed low and moderate cv 1 06 and 16 6 respectively regarding undisturbed samples except for ksat bd and volumetric water contents showed low cv values 5 8 and 4 0 respectively despite the natural variability of soil properties after wildfires movasat and tomac 2021 the soil sampling performed in this study was able to obtain results with low and moderate variability a reduction in om was observed in moderately severe b and highly severe soils that was greater at high temperatures as has been reported in previous studies at similar depth stoof et al 2010 terefe et al 2008 the increase in om in the moderately severe a event could be a rapid ecosystemic restoration due to bioturbation of rodents observed in the field campaign in the three wildfire events studied fire affected soils showed an increase in ph owing to ash accumulation and cation release from burned om memoli et al 2020 in the three wildfire events a decrease in ksat was observed in fire affected soils in contrast to the findings of moody et al 2016 the ksat decreases in the three fire events were similar 63 12 on average and the magnitude of the decrease did not increase substantially with wildfire severity the main element contributing to the decrease in ksat was inferred to be hydrophobicity which was observed during the field campaign this hydrophobicity is translated into the ksat measurement even though the soil samples require total saturation which may decrease water repellency diamantopoulos and durner 2013 increases in near surface bd as observed in highly severe wildfire events have been reported in other studies ferreira et al 2005 stoof et al 2010 a decrease in bd in moderately severe a was found which correlates with an increase in om jordán et al 2011 clay and sand did not differ significantly between the non affected and fire affected soils except for clay in the moderately severe b event as stoof et al 2010 demonstrated that the presence of ash and high temperatures did not alter soil texture it is likely that clay differences were due to field sampling rather than wildfire effects martínez et al 2022 3 2 changes in the soil water retention curves due to wildfires the soil water retention curves from soil cores at 0 5 cm depth are shown in fig 3 where the solid lines represent the average vg unimodal fitting the standard hyprop device is suitable for cylindrical samples measuring 5 cm in height which is consistent with studies where soil temperature during a wildfire typically affects between 2 and 5 cm in depth badía et al 2017 similar to the findings of filipović et al 2019 the fitted curves had comparable shapes for all three fire events slightly higher water content near saturation was observed in the fire affected soils than in the non affected soils in both moderately severe events this increase in water content could indicate structural changes in the soil surface gonzález pelayo et al 2006 promoting ash incorporation and water retention during high temperature events the passing of fire causes homogeneous soil conditions to alter macropores tending to decrease water content as observed by gonzales pelayo et al 2006 and ebel 2012 in addition lower water content has also been found in water repellent soil compared to regular soil movasat and tomac 2021 which is comparable to soil affected by high temperature events table 1 summarizes the average values of the unimodal van genuchten parameters and ksat based on swrc and ksat measurements the van genuchten parameters α n and residual θr water content did not show noticeable differences after the wildfire as reported by ebel and moody 2020 a decrease in θs was expected in fire affected soils because of the reduction in porosity shown by the increase in bd the decrease in θs has been reported by ebel and moody 2020 and stoof et al 2010 and this discrepancy may be owing to methodological differences in the swrc measurements for example ebel and moody 2020 and stoof et al 2010 used pressure plates versus the simplified evaporation method in this study the water content in sandy soils derived from the simplified evaporation method tends to be higher than that of pressure plates schelle et al 2013 values of θr for both conditions fire affected and non affected soils show values near zero assuming θr zero in coarse soils as the soils presented in this study does not make much difference using their estimated value however in fine textured soils with large surface areas θr is likely to be larger than zero because of the presence of adsorbed water van genuchten and pachepsky 2011 an accurate θr improves the srwc model estimates when predicting values beyond the driest measured point 3 3 estimation of swrc parameters using pedotransfer functions similar to the results reported by ebel 2012 our data show that wildfires decrease om content and increase bd however this does not translate into major changes in shape and water content in the swrc this suggests that using ptfs for estimating curves after wildfire events could be inaccurate fig 4 shows a comparison between the swrc fitted based on measurements and rosetta versions 1 2 and 3 the inputs used for each rosetta model corresponded to sand silt and clay bd and field capacity 33 kpa table 2 shows the rmse of the entire swrc and for the wet 333 hpa and dry 333 hpa parts of the swrc obtained from versions 1 2 and 3 rosetta v 1 could be the best option to estimate swrc parameters based on the rmse for the swrc showing a lower rmse for the entire curve rmse ranging between 0 023 and 0 055 as well as the wet rmse ranging between 0 027 and 0 080 and dry rmse ranging between 0 014 and 0 022 parts of the swrc the division of the swrc into two parts wassar et al 2016 highlights the discrepancy in the decrease in om and increase in bd without having an effect on θs values this is shown by the higher value of rmse in the wet part in contrast to the entire curve and the dry part this trend is similar to that reported by vero et al 2014 where rosetta v 1 fitting in the wet part of the swrc diverged with respect to θs relative to the swrc based on the measurements 3 4 wildfire effects on soil physical properties used as inputs in water flow modelling the simulations for an entire year volumetric water content at 2 5 cm and infiltration at the bottom are presented in fig 5 table 3 compares the swrc parameters based on measurements using rosetta v 1 estimations values of θs and α tend to be lower in rosetta estimates as compared to its curve fitting estimate while values of n and ksat are higher so lower θ values and higher bottom infiltration are expected in the modeling based on estimated rosetta parameters as a main result of the θ modelling fig 5a making the comparison only on simulations with experimentally obtained swrc and ksat data changes in θ are mainly observable at 2 5 cm depth for the highly severe wildfire event whereas moderately severe a and b events had similar soil water dynamic the simulated maximum θ values after the highest volume rainfall event for each location showed a 34 increase in the highly severe wildfire event whereas moderately severe a and b events showed a decrease of 21 30 and 5 25 respectively this is contrary to expectations since similar or lower water contents have been observed in soils burned at high temperatures in rainfall simulation experiments wieting et al 2017 as a main result of the θ modelling for comparing ptf and swrc and ksat measurements the fire affected soil in the moderately severe b wildfire event and both soils in the highly severe wildfire event presented discrepancies when using the rosetta v 1 ptf instead of parameters obtained based on measurements the differences in volumetric water content between the rosetta v 1 estimates and the measurement based data inputs were small for both water content and time of occurrence as expected the differences among the simulated water contents between the measurements and rosetta v 1 were directly linked to the estimated parameters soil water content was positively correlated with α and θ s halwatura et al 2017 which were both underestimated by rosetta v 1 it may be added that the observed differences between the rosetta parameter estimation and parameters derived from real measurements cannot be differentiated from the wildfire effect exclusively by hydrus 1d modelling in that case additional criteria such as more extensive soil and fire dataset need to be studied the main result from the bottom infiltration modelling fig 5b when comparing simulations with parameters obtained from the swrc and ksat measurements is that rosetta parameters tend to underestimate infiltration in hydrus 1 d compared of using those from measured swrc this underestimation in contrast to the measured swrc was more noticeable in fire affected than in non affected soils rosetta tended to overestimate n and ksat ksat showed the highest variations ranging from 3 77 to 2 977 which were more marked in fire affected soils in the soil dominions with moderately severe event topsoils a and b slightly higher infiltration to the bottom was observed in comparison to soil dominions with unaffected topsoils the maximum simulated bottom infiltration values between day of the year 220 and 250 showed a 4 15 decrease in the highly severe wildfire event whereas moderately severe a and b events showed 20 49 and 7 88 respectively fire affected topsoils had lower θs and higher ksat than that in the lower layer loamy soil the saturation occurred at lower soil water content and translated into greater infiltration to the bottom domínguez niño et al 2020 in fire affected soils the difference between rosetta estimated ksat in the topsoil and the lower layer average 54 18 cm d 1 as higher than that in not affected soils average 45 76 cm d 1 favoring a hydraulic barrier which accumulates water at the surface decreasing cumulative bottom infiltration guedessou et al 2021 scott 2000 the use of ptfs coupled with hydrological models such as hydrus 1d has been recommended in exploratory studies and for the quantification of potential effects islam et al 2006 owing to systematic deviations between measurements of water processes and their estimations vero et al 2014 the observations of this study suggest that θs and ksat can be conveniently determined using laboratory measurements and the use of ptfs can be limited for the fitting parameters α n and θr 4 conclusions this study analyzed the changes in basic soil properties after fire events and expanded upon previous studies to incorporate soil hydraulic properties natural soil conditions were studied and soil samples were collected within and outside fire affected areas after natural wildfires in the three different study areas basic soil properties confirmed changes in all three studied wildfire events in comparison with the non affected soils the main shifts were observed in om and ksat as decreases and in ph and bd as increases in contrast swrc shape changes were not observed markedly during any fire event except for a slight increase in water content in the case of fire affected soils the decrease in om content and the increase in bd did not translate into significant changes in water content in the swrc the parametric ptf rosetta was evaluated in its three available versions to determine its accuracy in both non affected and fire affected soils with particular emphasis on the latter because there are few studies on ptf and fire affected soils rosetta version 1 yielded the best estimates for both fire affected and non affected soils evaluating the swrc over the entire range of suctions the swrc parameters based on rosetta according to version 1 show differences with vg parameters based on the measured swrc the parameters θs and α were underestimated whereas n and ksat were overestimated however the parametric ptf rosetta showed similar accuracy for estimating vg parameters after wildfire events in comparison to non affected soil still the ksat estimates in fire affected soils were highly overestimated in comparison to the measured ksat values failing to estimate the hydrological behavior after wildfires when higher bottom infiltration in moderated fire events was observed owing to the discrepancies in ksat a simple soil dominion 5 cm of the studied soils 15 cm of a loamy soil was simulated using hydrus 1 d to compare the wildfire effects in the measured and estimated vg parameters used as inputs in water flow modelling the estimation of the swrc parameters showed differences when used as inputs in hydrus 1d in terms of simulating volumetric moisture content and bottom infiltration for both conditions fire affected and non affected the ksat and θs rosetta misestimating showed an impact on decreasing annual θ and infiltration at the bottom compared to parametrization based on measured values in conclusion in the case of fire affected soils rosetta can generate acceptable estimates for vg parameters yet it cannot properly capture ksat changes affecting its use in water modelling credit

limited to the sample data on which it was built it could be inaccurate for estimating curves after wildfire events the aims of this study were to a identify changes in basic soil properties and the swrc as a result of wildfires b assess ptf performance in unburned soils affected by wildfires and c evaluate changes in the swrc due to wildfires and subsequent water flow behavior changes through modelling 2 materials and methods 2 1 measuring soil properties three soils affected by wildfires were sampled at a depth of 0 10 cm one five months after the wildfire event hereafter referred to as fire affected soils soil samples were collected from the topsoils of natural wildfires in chile s central and southern regions 33 s to 36 s where wildfires occurred between 2019 and 2020 fire affected soil samples were collected near surface soil during three fire events moderately severe a moderately severe b and highly severe categorized according to martínez et al 2022 baseline samples were collected from neighboring unburned areas named unaffected soils based on the methodology proposed by varela et al 2015 in both moderately severe events non woody vegetation was consumed whereas in the highly severe event all vegetation was consumed and a layer of gray ash was observed fig 1 the sand silt and clay fractions were determined using the hydrometer method following om removal acevedo et al 2021 the om was measured by oxidation using a mixture of dichromate and sulfuric acid ph was measured using the standard method for chilean soils in a 1 2 5 ratio sadzawka et al 2006 except for soil texture n 1 average intriplicate measurementsfor eachsoil sample were performed for om and ph to obtain the soil hydraulic properties swrc and ksat undisturbed samples cores were collected at each site using 250 cm3 sampling rings and then refrigerated 4 c until analysis the soil rings were then saturated according to their soil texture and electrical conductivity once saturation was reached the saturated soil core was carefully placed in a ksat device meter and kept saturated by passing a cacl2 solution the falling head method was then selected based on the soil texture not clayey soils the swrc was then measured using a hyprop device meter group pullman wa usa the measurements water loss in the soil core vs time were recorded until the suction values from both tensiometers were close to zero after the hyprop measurement the soil core was sliced into four layers and each layer was measured using a wp4c dewpoint potentiometer acevedo et al 2020 kirste et al 2019 to obtain a moisture gradient through the soil core the final water content and bd of the soil core were measured after oven drying at 105 c except for ksat n 1 average induplicate measurementsfor eachsoil sample were performed for bd and swrc 2 2 water flow modelling using hydrus 1 d after obtaining the swrc data point measurements the curves were fitted to van genuchten parameters using the soilhyp r package dettmann 2019 using the fitshp function the parameters for the unimodal van genuchten model saturated θs residual θr n unitless alpha 1 cm 1 and ksat were estimated using rosetta version 1 2 and 3 schaap et al 2001 2004 zhang and schaap 2017 based on sand silt and clay contents field capacity and bd after obtaining the soil hydraulic properties using ptf rosetta or measurements a one year climatic scenario using hydrus 1d software was performed for both the fire affected and non affected soils hydrus 1d solves richard s equation using the finite element method šimůnek et al 2008 for the one year simulation meteorological data from nearby meteorological stations were used as the model inputs the surface boundary condition was an atmospheric boundary with surface runoff šimůnek and genuchten 2008 parameterized with the reported daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which were calculated using the net radiation air temperatures minimum and maximum relative humidity and wind speed the bottom boundary had free drainage the simulated soil dominion was 20 cm long where the first 5 cm corresponded to the topsoil fire affected and non affected soil and the remaining 15 cm corresponded to loamy soil the observation point was located at a depth of 2 5 cm a shallow dominion was selected because for loamy and sandy soils hydrus 1d have been recommended as a reasonable method to estimate soil water content holländer et al 2016 2 3 data analysis and statistics to compare the fitting between the swrc measurements and ptf estimates the root mean squared error rmse was computed as follows eq 1 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i o i 2 where e i and o i are the ith estimated and observed water content value and n is the number of observations respectively the coefficient of variation cv 100 standard deviation mean was used as a measure the degree of variation between measurements replicates the following statistical analyses and r packages were used tidyverse wickham et al 2019 and ggplot2 wickham 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in soil properties due to wildfires fig 2 shows the basic soil properties sampled at 0 10 cm and ksat and bd measurements from soil cores at 0 5 cm depth for the non affected and fire affected soils at the three wildfire events the sampling depth were selected based on previous studies stating that changes in soil properties after wildfires rarely exceed 10 cm agbeshie et al 2022 wieting et al 2017 carter and gregorich 2007 proposed that cv of soil properties can be categorized into low 15 moderate 15 35 high 35 75 and very high 75 variability excepting for soil texture ph and om measurements from disturbed samples showed low and moderate cv 1 06 and 16 6 respectively regarding undisturbed samples except for ksat bd and volumetric water contents showed low cv values 5 8 and 4 0 respectively despite the natural variability of soil properties after wildfires movasat and tomac 2021 the soil sampling performed in this study was able to obtain results with low and moderate variability a reduction in om was observed in moderately severe b and highly severe soils that was greater at high temperatures as has been reported in previous studies at similar depth stoof et al 2010 terefe et al 2008 the increase in om in the moderately severe a event could be a rapid ecosystemic restoration due to bioturbation of rodents observed in the field campaign in the three wildfire events studied fire affected soils showed an increase in ph owing to ash accumulation and cation release from burned om memoli et al 2020 in the three wildfire events a decrease in ksat was observed in fire affected soils in contrast to the findings of moody et al 2016 the ksat decreases in the three fire events were similar 63 12 on average and the magnitude of the decrease did not increase substantially with wildfire severity the main element contributing to the decrease in ksat was inferred to be hydrophobicity which was observed during the field campaign this hydrophobicity is translated into the ksat measurement even though the soil samples require total saturation which may decrease water repellency diamantopoulos and durner 2013 increases in near surface bd as observed in highly severe wildfire events have been reported in other studies ferreira et al 2005 stoof et al 2010 a decrease in bd in moderately severe a was found which correlates with an increase in om jordán et al 2011 clay and sand did not differ significantly between the non affected and fire affected soils except for clay in the moderately severe b event as stoof et al 2010 demonstrated that the presence of ash and high temperatures did not alter soil texture it is likely that clay differences were due to field sampling rather than wildfire effects martínez et al 2022 3 2 changes in the soil water retention curves due to wildfires the soil water retention curves from soil cores at 0 5 cm depth are shown in fig 3 where the solid lines represent the average vg unimodal fitting the standard hyprop device is suitable for cylindrical samples measuring 5 cm in height which is consistent with studies where soil temperature during a wildfire typically affects between 2 and 5 cm in depth badía et al 2017 similar to the findings of filipović et al 2019 the fitted curves had comparable shapes for all three fire events slightly higher water content near saturation was observed in the fire affected soils than in the non affected soils in both moderately severe events this increase in water content could indicate structural changes in the soil surface gonzález pelayo et al 2006 promoting ash incorporation and water retention during high temperature events the passing of fire causes homogeneous soil conditions to alter macropores tending to decrease water content as observed by gonzales pelayo et al 2006 and ebel 2012 in addition lower water content has also been found in water repellent soil compared to regular soil movasat and tomac 2021 which is comparable to soil affected by high temperature events table 1 summarizes the average values of the unimodal van genuchten parameters and ksat based on swrc and ksat measurements the van genuchten parameters α n and residual θr water content did not show noticeable differences after the wildfire as reported by ebel and moody 2020 a decrease in θs was expected in fire affected soils because of the reduction in porosity shown by the increase in bd the decrease in θs has been reported by ebel and moody 2020 and stoof et al 2010 and this discrepancy may be owing to methodological differences in the swrc measurements for example ebel and moody 2020 and stoof et al 2010 used pressure plates versus the simplified evaporation method in this study the water content in sandy soils derived from the simplified evaporation method tends to be higher than that of pressure plates schelle et al 2013 values of θr for both conditions fire affected and non affected soils show values near zero assuming θr zero in coarse soils as the soils presented in this study does not make much difference using their estimated value however in fine textured soils with large surface areas θr is likely to be larger than zero because of the presence of adsorbed water van genuchten and pachepsky 2011 an accurate θr improves the srwc model estimates when predicting values beyond the driest measured point 3 3 estimation of swrc parameters using pedotransfer functions similar to the results reported by ebel 2012 our data show that wildfires decrease om content and increase bd however this does not translate into major changes in shape and water content in the swrc this suggests that using ptfs for estimating curves after wildfire events could be inaccurate fig 4 shows a comparison between the swrc fitted based on measurements and rosetta versions 1 2 and 3 the inputs used for each rosetta model corresponded to sand silt and clay bd and field capacity 33 kpa table 2 shows the rmse of the entire swrc and for the wet 333 hpa and dry 333 hpa parts of the swrc obtained from versions 1 2 and 3 rosetta v 1 could be the best option to estimate swrc parameters based on the rmse for the swrc showing a lower rmse for the entire curve rmse ranging between 0 023 and 0 055 as well as the wet rmse ranging between 0 027 and 0 080 and dry rmse ranging between 0 014 and 0 022 parts of the swrc the division of the swrc into two parts wassar et al 2016 highlights the discrepancy in the decrease in om and increase in bd without having an effect on θs values this is shown by the higher value of rmse in the wet part in contrast to the entire curve and the dry part this trend is similar to that reported by vero et al 2014 where rosetta v 1 fitting in the wet part of the swrc diverged with respect to θs relative to the swrc based on the measurements 3 4 wildfire effects on soil physical properties used as inputs in water flow modelling the simulations for an entire year volumetric water content at 2 5 cm and infiltration at the bottom are presented in fig 5 table 3 compares the swrc parameters based on measurements using rosetta v 1 estimations values of θs and α tend to be lower in rosetta estimates as compared to its curve fitting estimate while values of n and ksat are higher so lower θ values and higher bottom infiltration are expected in the modeling based on estimated rosetta parameters as a main result of the θ modelling fig 5a making the comparison only on simulations with experimentally obtained swrc and ksat data changes in θ are mainly observable at 2 5 cm depth for the highly severe wildfire event whereas moderately severe a and b events had similar soil water dynamic the simulated maximum θ values after the highest volume rainfall event for each location showed a 34 increase in the highly severe wildfire event whereas moderately severe a and b events showed a decrease of 21 30 and 5 25 respectively this is contrary to expectations since similar or lower water contents have been observed in soils burned at high temperatures in rainfall simulation experiments wieting et al 2017 as a main result of the θ modelling for comparing ptf and swrc and ksat measurements the fire affected soil in the moderately severe b wildfire event and both soils in the highly severe wildfire event presented discrepancies when using the rosetta v 1 ptf instead of parameters obtained based on measurements the differences in volumetric water content between the rosetta v 1 estimates and the measurement based data inputs were small for both water content and time of occurrence as expected the differences among the simulated water contents between the measurements and rosetta v 1 were directly linked to the estimated parameters soil water content was positively correlated with α and θ s halwatura et al 2017 which were both underestimated by rosetta v 1 it may be added that the observed differences between the rosetta parameter estimation and parameters derived from real measurements cannot be differentiated from the wildfire effect exclusively by hydrus 1d modelling in that case additional criteria such as more extensive soil and fire dataset need to be studied the main result from the bottom infiltration modelling fig 5b when comparing simulations with parameters obtained from the swrc and ksat measurements is that rosetta parameters tend to underestimate infiltration in hydrus 1 d compared of using those from measured swrc this underestimation in contrast to the measured swrc was more noticeable in fire affected than in non affected soils rosetta tended to overestimate n and ksat ksat showed the highest variations ranging from 3 77 to 2 977 which were more marked in fire affected soils in the soil dominions with moderately severe event topsoils a and b slightly higher infiltration to the bottom was observed in comparison to soil dominions with unaffected topsoils the maximum simulated bottom infiltration values between day of the year 220 and 250 showed a 4 15 decrease in the highly severe wildfire event whereas moderately severe a and b events showed 20 49 and 7 88 respectively fire affected topsoils had lower θs and higher ksat than that in the lower layer loamy soil the saturation occurred at lower soil water content and translated into greater infiltration to the bottom domínguez niño et al 2020 in fire affected soils the difference between rosetta estimated ksat in the topsoil and the lower layer average 54 18 cm d 1 as higher than that in not affected soils average 45 76 cm d 1 favoring a hydraulic barrier which accumulates water at the surface decreasing cumulative bottom infiltration guedessou et al 2021 scott 2000 the use of ptfs coupled with hydrological models such as hydrus 1d has been recommended in exploratory studies and for the quantification of potential effects islam et al 2006 owing to systematic deviations between measurements of water processes and their estimations vero et al 2014 the observations of this study suggest that θs and ksat can be conveniently determined using laboratory measurements and the use of ptfs can be limited for the fitting parameters α n and θr 4 conclusions this study analyzed the changes in basic soil properties after fire events and expanded upon previous studies to incorporate soil hydraulic properties natural soil conditions were studied and soil samples were collected within and outside fire affected areas after natural wildfires in the three different study areas basic soil properties confirmed changes in all three studied wildfire events in comparison with the non affected soils the main shifts were observed in om and ksat as decreases and in ph and bd as increases in contrast swrc shape changes were not observed markedly during any fire event except for a slight increase in water content in the case of fire affected soils the decrease in om content and the increase in bd did not translate into significant changes in water content in the swrc the parametric ptf rosetta was evaluated in its three available versions to determine its accuracy in both non affected and fire affected soils with particular emphasis on the latter because there are few studies on ptf and fire affected soils rosetta version 1 yielded the best estimates for both fire affected and non affected soils evaluating the swrc over the entire range of suctions the swrc parameters based on rosetta according to version 1 show differences with vg parameters based on the measured swrc the parameters θs and α were underestimated whereas n and ksat were overestimated however the parametric ptf rosetta showed similar accuracy for estimating vg parameters after wildfire events in comparison to non affected soil still the ksat estimates in fire affected soils were highly overestimated in comparison to the measured ksat values failing to estimate the hydrological behavior after wildfires when higher bottom infiltration in moderated fire events was observed owing to the discrepancies in ksat a simple soil dominion 5 cm of the studied soils 15 cm of a loamy soil was simulated using hydrus 1 d to compare the wildfire effects in the measured and estimated vg parameters used as inputs in water flow modelling the estimation of the swrc parameters showed differences when used as inputs in hydrus 1d in terms of simulating volumetric moisture content and bottom infiltration for both conditions fire affected and non affected the ksat and θs rosetta misestimating showed an impact on decreasing annual θ and infiltration at the bottom compared to parametrization based on measured values in conclusion in the case of fire affected soils rosetta can generate acceptable estimates for vg parameters yet it cannot properly capture ksat changes affecting its use in water modelling credit

2402,understanding seasonal variation of the transit time distribution of stream discharge and evapotranspiration is crucial in exploring the flow pathways and the rainfall storage streamflow processes in a watershed of interest here both time variant and time invariant storage selection sas functions were adopted to estimate the transit time distribution in a moso bamboo watershed under the east asian monsoon climate daily stable isotopic compositions δ18o δ2h of precipitation and streamflow at the watershed outlet from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2020 were measured to calibrate the model parameters the time variant sas method considering watershed wetness performs slightly better than the time invariant sas method implying adding a watershed wetness indicator in the time variant model results in only a minor improvement young water fraction and median age as two streamflow age measures were derived from the time variant sas model the median age decreases abruptly within several days at three periods one is in january 2020 and the other two periods are in meiyu season with larger uncertainty while the estimated young water fraction varies gradually with much smaller uncertainty the young water fraction derived from the time variant sas method appears to be more reliable than that estimated by the tracer cycle damping method for stream discharge the storage preferentially releases younger water to discharge under wetter conditions in the east asian summer monsoon easm june september period while this phenomenon does not occur in the east asian winter monsoon eawm october may period the larger hourly rainfall intensity for the whole easm period mean intensity 2 08 mm h likely enhances direct contribution of event water to streamflow than that in the eawm period mean intensity 0 75 mm h the evapotranspiration is estimated to extract older water than stream discharge in both the eawm period and the easm period that is likely related to the occurrence of ecohydrological separation and root water uptake below the soil bedrock interface keywords stable isotopes sas functions young water fraction gamma distribution moso bamboo watershed east asian monsoon region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the transit time i e the time spent by a parcel of water through a watershed from input as precipitation to any of outflows away from the catchment is a variable useful for exploring flow pathways storage dynamics and water sources in a watershed of interest harman 2015 botter et al 2011 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 at any given time a watershed outflow e g stream discharge is composed of water from different parts of the watershed storage via various pathways thus has a wide range of transit times the transit time distribution ttd is the probability density function of water transit time in an outflow and has been widely accepted as a fundamental watershed descriptor of flow pathways and hydrologic processes jing et al 2021 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 another fundamental watershed descriptor residence time distribution rtd is defined as the age distribution of water parcels within the storage that has not yet exited the system these two watershed descriptors are correlated they both integrate flow path heterogeneity and encapsulate the hydrological processes as a function however they are different concepts streamflow is not a uniform mixture of all water stored in the watershed of different ages rodriguez et al 2018 kim et al 2016 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 thus using a lumped watershed residence time for streamflow transit time estimation is problematic for example previous studies have found that a perfect mixing between precipitation and storage within the whole watershed is not adequate to simulate the variation of tracer concentration in outlet discharge knighton et al 2017 hrachowitz et al 2015 thus non uniform distribution models are required for transit time characterization these include time invariant and time variant models in contrast to a time invariant model a time variant model is more suitable to capture short term behavior of a watershed rodriguez et al 2018 benettin et al 2017b hrachowitz et al 2010 for a time invariant model a basic assumption in most previous studies is that the hydrologic system is in a steady state condition therefore the long term releasing processes from the storage to outlet discharge can be characterized by a hydrological time invariant transit time distribution for example a gamma distribution mcguire et al 2005 kirchner et al 2000 an exponential distribution ogrinc et al 2018 or an advection dispersion equation mosquera et al 2016 wienhöfer et al 2009 however the limitations of the time invariant models are obvious i e temporal variations in flow pathways storage dynamics and hydrometeorological forcing are ignored a time variant model is favored in recent studies because of its better performance and more information about the timing and magnitude of peak tracer fluxes stockinger et al 2014 hrachowitz et al 2010 many time variant models have been successfully used in simulating the temporal variation of tracers in streamflow they include the tracer aided conceptual model stevenson et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b lagrangian particle tracking model jing et al 2021 and storage selection function sas zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2020 harman 2015 the functions of the sas model have recently been developed to relate the age structure in storage and outflow under transient conditions in which a master equation me is solved to express the relationship between residence time distribution and transit time distribution botter et al 2011 once the relationship between age distribution of storage and outflow has been established the water and solute transport processes can also be identified the sas functions form a parsimonious lumped model which spatially integrates the flow pathways and hydrological processes into a unified framework therefore the parameters of an sas model are the lumped representation of the tracer transport processes in a watershed an sas model can be applied in either a time invariant or time variant manner the time variant sas model has been applied to effectively simulate the rainfall storage streamflow processes at the watershed scale sprenger et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 fang et al 2019 benettin et al 2017b they have been tested on artificial hillslopes kim et al 2022 kim and harman 2022 and lysimeter experiments meira neto et al 2022 kim et al 2016 on the other hand the time invariant sas model with a default parameter kq 0 5 which determines the affinity of discharge for relatively younger or older water in storage seems to work well in the brundtland burn catchment benettin et al 2017b one problem in applying an sas model is that the equifinality of different parameter sets can result in the deviation between the simulation and reality sprenger et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 kirchner 2019 thus higher resolution isotopic composition data of streamflow and other water compartments are required to provide more detailed information for the hydrological models and to decrease the parameter uncertainty young water fraction has been widely used as one representative age metric of streamflow when using the sas models benettin et al 2020 kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b young water fraction is defined as the fraction of streamflow younger than a threshold age and can be estimated from a simple using amplitude ratio as ap and a complex using phase shift φ s φ p tracer cycle damping method or derived from transit time models kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b young water fraction generally shows the seasonal variation when it derived from a time variant transit time model but it is a fixed value when it estimated from a simple or a complex tracer cycle damping method benettin et al 2020 comparing young water fraction estimated from these three methods is worth investigating for improving understanding of the solute transport processes in a watershed of interest median age defined as the age which is smaller than that of 50 water particles is another representative age metric of streamflow when using the sas models rodriguez et al 2018 benettin et al 2017b benettin et al 2015 the median age is more easily derived from transit time models than that of young water fraction because the threshold age of young water fraction needs to be obtained from another method for estimating young water fraction in general both metrics are independent of the older water components as they do not need to specify maximum age which is highly uncertain in most estimation approaches benettin et al 2017b previous studies have used one of the two to represent relative age of streamflow zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2020 rodriguez et al 2018 harman 2015 however which one has lower uncertainty has not been discussed in previous studies benettin et al 2017a in this study an sas model is applied to investigate the flow pathways and rainfall storage streamflow processes in moso bamboo watershed moso bamboo phyllostachys edulis a temperate species is widely distributed in subtropical regions and native to china li and feng 2019 the area of moso bamboo coverage in china is approximately 4 67 mha accounting for 70 of the total bamboo forest area in china and approximately 16 of global bamboo forest area zhang et al 2019a the area of moso bamboo continues to increase at a rate of 3 annually in china due to its rapid growth rate high economic benefits and ecological benefits li et al 2013 this change has caused some concerns given that the area expansion of moso bamboo and changes in vegetation types may alter the hydrological processes and water balance at the watershed scale shinohara et al 2019 ide et al 2010 previous studies have found that the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in a moso bamboo watershed tends to be larger than that in other types of vegetation cover and lateral subsurface flow seems to be more common than in other forests zhou et al 2012 ide et al 2010 wang and liu 1995 although several studies have explored hydrological processes by monitoring mass fluxes of water and selected constituents in moso bamboo watersheds han et al 2021 han et al 2020 the age distribution of evapotranspiration water and stream discharge is not well understood for such watersheds these age distributions if known could provide insights into solute transport processes and improve understanding of nutrient attenuation they can be estimated by long term and high resolution tracer s data of precipitation and streamflow in a watershed of interest benettin et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the subtropical regions in china are entirely controlled by east asian monsoon characterized by hot and humid in the east asian summer monsoon period and cold and dry in the east asian winter monsoon period the hydrologic response of a watershed to the precipitation are quite different under different monsoon periods because of the seasonal variation of rainfall intensity han et al 2020 watershed wetness han et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b and evapotranspiration zhang et al 2019a in addition previous studies on hydrologic transit time using time invariant models e g a lumped parameter convolution method could not explore the factors determining the seasonal variation of water ages in the east asian monsoon region dai et al 2022 hu et al 2020 in this study seasonal variation of transit time distribution is investigated using a time variant sas model the stable isotopic compositions of precipitation groundwater streamflow at multiple locations soil water at different depths from continuous sampling with regular time interval from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2020 and two field campaigns were used to investigate flow pathways storage dynamics and water sources in a moso bamboo watershed in the subtropical region the objectives of this research are to 1 investigate the seasonal variation of transit time distribution of streamflow and evapotranspiration 2 examine the suitability of the published default parameter kq of the time invariant sas model for the studied watershed 3 compare young water fraction estimated from the time variant sas model and the tracer cycle damping method 4 analyze the uncertainty of young water fraction and median age from the time variant sas method 2 study

vegetable type han et al 2022 liu et al 2012 sandy loam sand and loamy sand soil are the dominant soil texture types according to the united states department of agriculture usda classification system

hydrometeorological observation and field sampling 3 1 1 hydrometeorological observation at the hemuqiao watershed outlet g4 a v notch weir was established an hobo u20 water level logger onset computer corporation bourne mam usa with a time interval of 5 min was equipped in this weir to automatically record water level in addition to the discharge data meteorological data was also obtained from a meteorological station near the watershed outlet fig 1 including temperature relative humidity and wind with a time interval of 6 min daily free water surface evaporation data was obtained from hangzhou meteorological station 50 km away from the study area free water surface evaporation et0 observation adopted the national standard using a pan evaporator e601b model in the meteorological station zhang et al 2019a reported the annual actual evapotranspiration values in a moso bamboo watershed 18 km away from our study watershed from 2012 to 2014 based on an eddy covariance system the average ratio of actual evapotranspiration using eddy covariance measurement to free water surface evaporation in hangzhou meteorological station approximately equal to 0 78 from 2012 to 2014 thus the

continuous isotope data precipitation and watershed outlet streamflow were sampled daily and the g1 g2 and g3 streamflow were sampled weekly from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2020 weekly groundwater sampling was conducted in a groundwater well 2 5 m deep in the middle reach of this watershed from 1 january 2019 to 31 december 2020 but the groundwater level was not recorded 3 1 3 flood event sampling two sampling campaigns meiyu from 17 06 2019 to 07 07 2019 and typhoon rainfall from 07 08 2019 to 16 08 2019 were focused on the watershed response to two wetting episodes in the summer of 2019 samples of precipitation were collected during each wetting episode soil water streamflow and groundwater were sampled prior to each episode to represent antecedent water hourly precipitation was collected in the middle reach of watershed about 220 m sea level height and were transferred into 30 ml polyethylene vials hourly streamflow samplings were collected from g1 g2 gs and watershed outlet g4 all hourly samplings were conducted in the daytime from 8 00 to 18 00 during these two rainfall events daily groundwater was collected at 8 00 every day distributed and stratified 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil samples were collected in a soil profile on a hillslope fig 1 at 8 00 and 18 00 every day sealed in ziplock bags and placed in coolers for transport 3 1 4 stable isotope analysis the collected soil samples were extracted using a fully automatic cryogenic vacuum extraction system li 2100 automatic water extraction system lica united technology soil water samples were extracted for 90 min at a high temperature of 105 to ensure that the bulk water in the soil samples was completely extracted west et al 2006 all water samples were filtered with 0 22 μm filter paper into 2 ml vials the stable isotopic compositions of δ18o and δ2h were measured with thermo fishher mat 253 in the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering in hohai university repeated analysis of every water sample for 6 times and the first three results were deleted to minimize the memory of machine the arithmetic mean of the last three results was used to represent the sample isotopic composition analytical precision for δ18o and δ2h was 0 1 and 2 respectively 3 2 the storage selection sas approach and calibration this study adopted the age ranked storage st to label the volumes of precipitation that entered the watershed at different times in the past and have not been released yet benettin et al 2017b harman 2015 the time varying age ranked storage is the volume of water storage younger than a given age kim et al 2022 harman 2015 when assigning each outflow discharge or evapotranspiration an appropriate sas function the time evolution of relationship between the age ranked water in storage and in outflow can be identified benettin et al 2017b harman 2015 1 s t t t t s t t t t j t q t ω q s t t t t e t t ω et s t t t t where j t q t and et t is precipitation discharge and evapotranspiration at time t respectively s t t t is the volume in the storage younger than t at time t ω q s t t ω et s t t is the sas function and represent the fraction of total discharge evapotranspiration which is produced by s t t t at any time t in this study power law shaped functions are used to express the sas function ω q s t t and ω et s t t zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2017b queloz et al 2015 2 ω q s t t s t t t s t k q 3 ω et s t t s t t t s t k et the kq 0 and ket 0 determine the affinity of discharge and evapotranspiration for relatively younger or older water in storage benettin and bertuzzo 2018 kq 1 represents random sampling where the water with different ages completely mixed in the storage kq less than 1 kq 1 implies more proportion of younger water older water in the storage releases for discharge the same explanation applies to ket both the time variant and time invariant models are tested in this study here the time invariant model represents that both kq and ket are constant in the time variant model kq changes between two end members kq1 and kq2 over time benettin et al 2017b the interpolation between two end numbers is related to watershed wetness ws which can be expressed as a function of discharge that is because the discharge is closely related to the watershed storage and discharge data is more accessible than storage data kirchner 2009 4 w s t q t q min q max q min 5 k q t k q 1 1 w s t k q 2 k q 1 where qmax and qmin represent the maximum and minimum discharge during the study period q t represents the discharge at time t kq1 and kq2 are two parameters which determine the range of kq the discharge and evapotranspiration age distribution can be obtained from eq 1 and expressed as following zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2017b 6 p q t t ω q s t t s t t 7 p et t t ω et s t t s t t where p q t t and p et t t represent the age distribution in discharge and evapotranspiration respectively ω q s t t and ω et s t t are the probability density function of ω q s t t and ω et s t t respectively eqs 6 and 7 express that how the age ranked storage releases for the discharge and evapotranspiration the same selection process can be used to describe the stable isotopic compositions that are released from the storage to discharge and evapotranspiration the stable isotopic compositions in discharge c q t and evapotranspiration c et t can be expressed in the following equations 8 c q t 0 c s s t t ω q s t t d s t 9 c et t 0 c s s t t ω et s t t d s t where c s s t t represents the stable isotopic compositions of storage s t t t it is worth noting that evaporation is depleted in heavy isotopic compositions compared to storage this depletion causes the remaining water in storage enriched in heavy isotopic compositions benettin et al 2017b in general plant water uptake does not cause isotopic fractionation xiao et al 2018 it is difficult for us to divide the evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration based on our current investigation data thus in this study we lump evaporation and transpiration fluxes together queloz et al 2015 according to the water mass and isotope mass balance the isotopic compositions of age ranked storage can be expressed as zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2017b 10 d δ s t t t i dt 1 α et e t t t i ω et s t t t i δ s t t t i where ti is the time step and α et is the fractionation factor the initial ranges of the parameters kq1 kq2 ket for the time variant model and kq ket for the time invariant model were set according to the previous study table 2 benettin et al 2017b the α et was set to 0 9 1 larger than that of 0 95 1 used by benettin et al 2017b because evapotranspiration in our watershed 800 mm yr 1 is much larger than that in bruntland burn catchment 400 mm yr 1 sprenger et al 2017 for initial watershed storage s0 the upper bound was estimated according to the maximum soil depth about 1 5 m on hillslopes and 2 5 m in the valley multiplied by the average porosity of 40 plus water stored in the fractured rock below the soil bedrock interface 170 mm han et al 2021 the upper bound of s0 is similar with the storage derived from water balance in a nearby moso bamboo watershed 18 km away from our watershed zhang et al 2019a the isotopic composition δ18o of initial st was assumed to be the long term flow weighted average δ18o in discharge 6 52 during the study period the model was primed using the data from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2018 and then fit with the measured δ18o in outlet streamflow from 1 january 2019 to 31 december 2020 calibration period a total of 100 000 parameter groups were randomly generated from the initial ranges using the monte carlo approach table 2 the model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the nse is sensitive to time series peaks stockinger et al 2016 nash and sutcliffe 1970 only the 200 parameter groups with the highest nse values were retained for analyzing the uncertainty of each parameter 95 confidence interval table 2 the age distributions derived from the sas model at any time steps can be fitted by a gamma distribution function following benettin et al 2017b the gamma distribution function can be used to characterize the long term releasing processes from the storage to the discharge and et as well as to estimate the mean transit time a similar monte carlo approach was also used to assess the uncertainty of gamma distribution function fitting and the initial ranges of shape parameter αsas and scale parameter βsas were set to 0 1 and 0 2000 respectively 3 3 young water fraction calculation the young water fraction can be accurately predicted by using the relationship between seasonal tracer cycles of precipitation and streamflow kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b it can be calculated from the cumulative transit time distribution if the threshold age of young water fraction of a watershed is known in this study the young water fraction fyw was estimated using three methods including the simple tracer cycle damping method the complex tracer cycle damping method and a derivation from the time variant sas model the time variant method requires threshold age which is estimated by the complex tracer cycle damping method to calculate young water fraction both the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods use sine waves to fit time series of δ18o in precipitation and outlet discharge by using the iteratively reweighted least squares method respectively in rstudio the weight for δ18o in precipitation and outlet discharge were daily precipitation amount and daily runoff depth respectively 11 c p t a p c o s 2 π f t b p s i n 2 π f t k p 12 c s t a s c o

respectively kp and ks are the vertical shift of sine waves and f is the frequency of the fitted sine wave set to 1 365 days ap bp as bs are the coefficients for determining the amplitude and phase shift of seasonal cycles ap and as are the amplitudes of fitted sine waves φp and φs are the phase shifts of fitted sine waves young water fraction can be calculated from the simple tracer cycle

expressed as a function of the shape parameter αyw stockinger et al 2016 15 φ s φ p α yw tan 1 a s a p 2 α yw 1 according to eq 15 the shape parameter can be obtained by numerical iteration the scale

threshold age were conducted using the monte carlo approach the standard error of each fitted parameter i e ap bp as bs in eq 11 and eq 12 can be obtained in rstudio the 95 confidence interval for these parameters were defined as average 2 standard error respectively a total of 2000 parameter groups were randomly generated from 95 confidence interval for each parameter and ranges of young water fraction and threshold age could be calculated both simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods calculate fyw based on daily δ18o in outlet discharge for different time periods one is the entire study period from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2020 another is the calibration period in addition the young water fraction derived from the time variant sas model is based on the fixed threshold age in eq 17 using the isotope data of the entire study period from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2020 3 4 statistical analysis linear regression was applied to explore linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o in different water sources and an analysis of covariance ancova was used to assess the difference of linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o in different water sources coefficient of variations cv defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean was used to compare the frequency distribution of median age and young water fraction calculated from 200 best parameter combinations at any time step the correlation coefficient r and significance test p were analyzed by pearson s correlation test and two tailed t test respectively statistical analyses were conducted in ibm spss statistics 24 4 results 4 1 hydrologic and isotopic characterization precipitation in the hemuqiao watershed is unevenly distributed throughout the year in the easm period precipitation accounts for 56 9 of its annual precipitation with high evapotranspiration rates 2 61 mm day fig 2 in the eawm period monthly mean precipitation 77 8 mm month is less than that in the easm period 210 mm month and the daily evapotranspiration 1 44 mm day is relatively less than that in the easm period the mean annual runoff coefficient during the study period is 0 51 and the hydrograph in the watershed outlet exhibits a flashy response to precipitation even during the dry period the isotopic composition δ18o in precipitation ranges from 11 53 to 4 06 is relatively more variable throughout the year than that in outlet streamflow ranges from 8 86 to 3 54 fig 3 table 3 in the monsoon transition period from the eawm period to the easm period there is a decreasing trend of δ18o values in precipitation from may to june the beginning of meiyu season fig 3 precipitation gradually enriched in heavy isotope at the beginning of the eawm period the δ18o in outlet streamflow shows a similar seasonal variation with δ18o in precipitation in addition the volume weighted δ18o in streamflow 6 52 is slightly less negative than amount weighted δ18o in precipitation 6 66 during the study period however this difference is very minor the local meteoric water line lmwl was established based on the monthly amount weighted mean isotopic compositions in the hemuqiao watershed fig 4 table 3 δ2h 8 08 δ18o 10 38 n 27 r2 0 91 the slope and intercept of lwml are similar with those of global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 and the slope and intercept for linear regressions between δ2h and δ18o in streamflow at multiple locations and groundwater are relatively lower than those of lmwl table 3 fig 4 an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between δ2h and δ18o shows significant difference between precipitation and streamflow at multiple locations p 0 001 and there is insignificant difference between groundwater and streamflow at multiple locations p 0 476 both δ2h and δ18o in groundwater and streamflow at multiple locations exhibit significant positive linear relationship respectively r 0 85 p 0 01 table 4 4 2 performance of the time variant and time invariant sas models the results of posterior distribution of the time variant and the time invariant model parameters are shown in fig 5 and summarized in table 2 for the parameter ket and s0 of these two models the ranges mean values and the standard deviations are very similar table 2 and these parameters are clearly identified fig 5 the mean ket for both models is 0 7 which is less than 1 indicating the et flux tends to extract water of younger age the mean fractionation parameter α et for both models are 0 99 implying et flux only leads to very minor enrichment in heavy isotope in storage the initial storage parameter s0 for both models are approximated to 750 mm in addition the parameter kq for time invariant model is clearly identified and the optimal parameter is 0 51 this value is very close to a previous investigation of the bruntland burn catchment which has an optimal parameter kq of 0 5 benettin et al 2017b this result shows that the default kq of 0 5 also applies for the hemuqiao watershed as for the time variant model the kq2 is clearly identified optimal value is 0 49 but the kq1 is an insensitive parameter and could not clearly be identified optimal value is 0 39 nevertheless given that kq1 under wet condition is supposed to be smaller than kq2 for dry condition the optimal value of 0 39 seems to be reasonable the maximum objective function value of nse for the time variant 0 63 model is slightly larger than that of the time invariant model 0 58 indicating that the time invariant model seems to work well and adding a watershed wetness indicator in the time variant models results in a minor improvement fig 5 in this study we focus more on the results from the time variant model to explore the response of δ18o in streamflow to the δ18o in the precipitation inputs the daily measured and simulated δ18o in outlet streamflow using the time variant sas approach are shown in fig 6 the result shows that the model is able to capture the dynamics of the measured δ18o in streamflow with nse 0 63 for the calibration period the model was able to reproduce the δ18o peaks in late may every year and unusually lowest δ18o values measured in streamflow in super typhoon lekima 08 09 2019 11 08 2019 can also be well reproduced fig 6 however the simulated streamflow is more depleted in heavy isotopic composition than that measured in streamflow from january to may in 2019 the most likely explanation for this is that the extraordinary evaporation in 2018 may lead to a systemic shift in the initial conditions in the simulated storage 4 3 young water fraction estimated by three methods young water fraction as an age metric of streamflow is examined in this study based on the two tracer cycle damping methods the threshold ages of young water estimated from different time periods entire study period or calibration period are consistent but the young water fractions calculated from these two periods are quite different for entire study period the threshold age of young water is estimated to be 51 days with an uncertainty range of 47 56 days according to the complex tracer cycle damping method kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b table 5 young water fraction ranges from 23 to 35 with an average of 29 according to the complex tracer cycle damping method applying the simple tracer cycle damping method the young water fraction ranges from 21 to 33 with an average of 27 young water fraction obtained by these two methods are similar around 28 when we just calculate the young water fraction using the data from 1 january 2019 to 31 december 2020 calibration period the threshold age for young water fraction is similar to the result calculated by the entire study period however the young water fraction based on calibration period data estimated by the complex tracer cycle damping method ranges from 32 to 50 with an average of 41 and the simple tracer cycle damping method ranges from 29 to 46 with an average of 39 are both higher than the young water fraction estimated based on the whole study period the age distribution calculated at any time in the time variant sas modelling can be used to obtain the young water fraction τyw 51 days and median age of the streamflow at the corresponding time step the temporal variation of young water fraction and median age are shown in fig 7 the volume weighted young water fraction of the best parameter combination kq1 0 39 kq2 0 49 ket 0 72 s0 790 mm α et 0 99 is 51 which is larger than those estimated by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping method about 40 in addition both young water fraction and median age derived from the sas model exhibit the notable seasonal variability with relatively high young water fraction mean value 53 and low median age mean 43 days in the easm period relatively low young water fraction mean value 35 and large median age mean 93 days in the eawm period fig 7 4 4 comparison of time variant sas derived young water fraction and median age there is a significant negative correlation between young water fraction and median age over the entire study period r 0 781 p 0 001 and the negative correlation is more significant in the easm period r 0 790 p 0 001 than that in the eawm period r 0 550 p 0 001 in the meiyu season a sharp decrease in the median age from 100 days to 20 days within several days and the young water fraction gradually increases from 45 to 65 within about a month another sharp decrease in the median age occurs in late january 2020 the median age decreases from 140 days to 60 days but the young water fraction does not follow a gradual increasing trend as for the meiyu season fig 7 mean vwc in these two periods are high 30 indicating that the watershed is in wet condition in addition to the sharp decrease in the median age the cv values of median age at most time steps 484 731 days are relatively higher than those of young water fraction fig 8 the higher cv value is the larger uncertainty in the corresponding age metrics of streamflow is in general the uncertainty in median age in the eawm period cv 0 15 is less than that in the easm period cv 0 21 and the uncertainty in young water fraction the eawm period cv 0 07 the easm period cv 0 10 is less than that of the median age in both the easm period and the easm period 4 5 the seasonal variation of transit time distribution 4 5 1 seasonal variation of the storage effect the storage effect refers to the proportional water of different ages in the output in comparison to the watershed storage two types of storage effects are defined in the literature which are the direct and inverse storage effects the direct storage effect means an increase of old water fraction in discharge under high storage conditions while the inverse storage effect means an increase of young water fraction in discharge under high storage conditions harman 2015 previous studies suggested that these two effects are closely related to the hydrologic flow pathways temporal dynamics of connectivity and runoff generation mechanisms zhang et al 2021 rodriguez et al 2018 kim et al 2016 harman 2015 in this study we explore the inverse storage effect by establishing the relationship between storage and young water fraction rather than the median age the positive relationship between storage and young water fraction suggests an inverse storage effect and the negative relationship indicates a direct storage effect no significant relationship is shown between storage and young water fraction in the eawm period r 0 017 p 0 798 apparent positive correlation between storage and young water fraction in the easm period r 0 175 p 0 006 suggests that the watershed preferentially releases younger water to discharge under high storage conditions 4 5 2 transit time distribution in stream discharge and evapotranspiration water the flow weighted gamma fitting of stream discharge in the easm and the eawm period from the best parameter combination are shown in fig 9 and the ranges of parameters and mean transit time from the flow weighted calculations are summarized in table 6 for the eawm period flow weighted mean transit time ranges from 139 to 171 days with an average of 153 days for the easm period the flow weighted mean transit time ranges from 104 to 135 days with an average of 119 days in addition the flow weighted gamma distribution fitting predicts that 27 of the streamflow is younger than 7 days flood usually last 3 7 days which is almost twice of that in the eawm period 15 indicating the event water plays an important role in determining the age ranked water in streamflow more details of the event water transport processes in the easm period are included in the section 4 5 3 the flux weighted gamma distribution fitting was also conducted to estimate the mean transit time of et in the eawm and the easm period respectively fig 9 table 6 in general the flux weighted mean transit time of et is larger than that of streamflow both in the eawm and the easm period for the eawm period flux weighted mean transit time ranges from 184 to 217 days with an average of 203 days for the easm period flux weighted mean transit time ranges from 147 to 183 days with an average of 165 days in addition the flux weighted gamma distribution fitting predicts that 17 of the et is younger than 7 days in the easm period which is almost three times larger than that in the eawm period 4 9 in addition the event water fraction in et is less than those in streamflow both in the eawm and the easm period 4 5 3 watershed hydrological response and stable isotopic characteristic sub daily isotopic compositions in various water sources were used to investigate the watershed hydrological response to two wetting episodes in the hemuqiao watershed in 2019 one is a meiyu episode and the other is a typhoon episode fig 10 table s1 the first sampling campaign was conducted during a meiyu episode occurring on 17 june to 7 july 2019 fig 10 the precipitation was 248 8 mm and the peak rainfall intensity was 34 mm h table s1 the streamflow at multiple locations and groundwater depleted in heavy isotope of oxygen as the discharge first increased and δ18o in outlet streamflow reached the minimum value at 11 00 21st june after 140 mm rainfall then these water sources showed relatively stable δ18o values range from 6 to 8 the isotopic compositions in soil water at different depths exhibited similar temporal variation person correlation between soil water at different depths are shown in table s2 r 0 55 p less than 0 01 the mean δ18o in soil water reached the minimum value 8 67 at the same days as that in outlet streamflow the second sampling campaign was conducted during a typhoon episode super typhoon lekima occurring on 7th august 2019 fig 10 the precipitation was 189 3 mm over 50 h with a low peak rainfall intensity 13 8 mm h table s1 the streamwater at multiple locations and groundwater depleted in heavy isotope of oxygen as the discharge increased and δ18o in outlet streamflow reached the minimum value at 9 00 11th august then these water sources showed relatively stable δ18o values in a small range of 7 10 the isotopic compositions in soil water at different depths also exhibited similar temporal variation table s2 r 0 86 p 0 01 the mean δ18o in soil water reached the minimal value 12 78 at the same time as that in outlet streamflow 5 discussion 5 1 difference in the estimated young water fraction from the three methods in this study we found that young water fraction has a lower uncertainty than median age derived from the time variant sas model fig 8 we also found that the young water fractions estimated by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods using isotope data of calibration period are approximately 41 which is larger than the previous studies conducted in the east asian monsoon region dai et al 2022 hu et al 2020 jasechko et al 2016 the lower topographic wetness index associated with higher drainage density in the hemuqiao watershed mean twi 1 87 mean drainage density 9 30 km km2 lead to a higher young water fraction than other watershed in zhejiang province mean twi 6 35 mean drainage density 2 28 km km2 young water fraction 0 33 hu et al 2020 von freyberg et al 2018 the seasonal variation of young water fraction cannot be revealed by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods which is considered one limitation of these methods kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b however the seasonal variation of young water fraction can be estimated by the time variant sas model and the volume weighted young water fraction 51 obtained from the sas model is larger than that estimated by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods using isotope data of the period 41 these three young water fractions calculated by different methods are comparable on the basis of having the same threshold age and the threshold age of young water is selected according to the complex tracer cycle damping method the threshold age of young water is insensitive to tracer data of different periods and sampling frequency according to kirchner method kirchner 2016a stockinger et al 2016 table 5 so the threshold age of young water for these three methods is reasonable the uncertainty in the estimated young water fraction is considered another limitation of the cycle damping method table 5 shows the interannual variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation leads to differences in estimated young water fractions using simple and complex tracer cycle damping gallart et al 2020 for example the amount weighted δ18o in precipitation from october to december in 2018 is 8 61 which is more negative than that in other years 5 08 in 2017 5 55 in 2019 6 58 in 2020 so the wave trough of sine wave fitting using precipitation isotope data of the entire study period 8 75 is lower than that using isotope data of calibration period 8 07 this results in different young water fractions estimated based on the tracer data of the calibration period 40 and that of the entire study period 30 kirchner 2016a b another piece of evidence is that the volume unweighted young water fraction obtained from the time variant sas model is about 40 which is similar with the results estimated by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods in general the young water fraction derived from the time variant sas model is more reliable the tracer cycle damping methods provide estimation of young water fraction only for one threshold age this threshold age does not necessarily align well with those of the processes of interest in contrast the time variant sas model can provide estimation of water fraction for any age thresholds making it more flexible for investigating watershed processes benettin et al 2020 for example factors controlling solute transport in event scale can be revealed using a small threshold age less than 1 week benettin et al 2017a this study the weathering processes of si can be investigated using a threshold age of 2 weeks calibrated kinetic constant for si benettin et al 2017a investigation of long term fate of nitrate removal process requires a large threshold age e g 1 year guillaumot et al 2021 5 2 preferential release of younger water to summer discharge under wetter conditions in the moso bamboo watershed under the east asian monsoon climate the inverse storage effect exists during the easm period however this effect does not occur during the eawm period which is similar with a previous study conducted in a karst catchment in the east asian monsoon region zhang et al 2021 the flow weighted gamma distribution suggests that 27 of the streamflow is younger than 7 days during the easm period which is almost two times of that in the eawm period 15 this result is consistent with previous studies which suggest that the event water plays an important role in determining the inverse storage effect zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2017b harman 2015 another piece of evidence is that the difference of event water proportion 12 accounts for 2 3 of the difference of young water fraction 18 between the easm period and the eawm period fig 9 isotopic composition data of a high sampling frequency streamflow and other water sources in two wetting episodes in 2019 are used to explore how the event water rapidly contributes to the streamflow during the easm period fig 10 the different soil types in each sub watershed do not cause the significant difference in isotopic compositions in streamflow at multiple locations from both weekly and sub daily sampling frequencies fig 3 fig 10 table 4 the spatial differences in soil types generally lead to the spatial difference in saturated hydraulic conductivity in this watershed the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from 34 to 161 mm h with an average of 101 mm h fig s1 the lowest soil saturated hydraulic conductivity is close to the maximum precipitation intensity 34 6 mm h in 26 july 2018 during the study period indicating that the hortonian overland flow rarely occurs in this watershed and the heterogeneous soil types have little effect on runoff generation mechanism in different sub watersheds in addition isotopic compositions in soil water at different depths exhibit similar temporal variation at the event scale implying that subsurface flow in the soil above the soil bedrock interface is mainly vertical furthermore more depleted in heavy isotopic composition of oxygen in soil water than that in groundwater and streamflow suggests that precipitation and pre event water have been well mixed as soil water transfers to groundwater and streamflow through the soil bedrock interface han et al 2020 2021 fig 10 this is also supported by prior findings that the tracer signals from different parts of the catchment become well mixed within the valley bottoms lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016 the difference of event water proportion between the eawm and the easm period are very likely associated with the hourly rainfall intensity and the different hourly rainfall intensity generally leads to difference in flow pathways of a watershed of interest xiao et al 2022 han et al 2020 yang and chu 2013 in the easm period the large hourly rainfall intensity generally leads to high event water proportion in streamflow while in the eawm period the small hourly rainfall intensity 0 75 mm h does not trigger preferential flow as much as that in the easm period the hydrological processes in the hemuqiao watershed were dominated by subsurface saturation excess during heavy rainfall events han et al 2020 liu et al 2012 the mean hourly rainfall intensity for the whole time in the eawm period 0 75 mm h is less than that of the easm period 2 08 mm h fig 11 indicating the larger hourly rainfall intensity in the easm period tend to facilitate mobilization event water to streamflow than that in the eawm period 5 3 evapotranspiration extracting older water than streamflow in this study the parameter for et ket is clearly identified from both the time variant and time invariant models in addition the correlation coefficients between ket and other parameters of 200 best parameter combinations is relatively low less than 0 3 both in time invariant and time variant sas model fig s2 fig s3 the fitted ket in both models is larger than parameter kq implying that et tends to extract older water than stream discharge fig 5 table 2 consistently the mean transit time of et are larger than those of streamflow both in the eawm and the easm periods table 6 it is widely accepted that the et tends to extract younger water from storage compared to streamflow zhang et al 2021 asenjan and danesh yazdi 2020 visser et al 2019 harman 2015 because the evaporation from topsoil and transpiration from plants tend to release younger water from storage as long as they are available to them asenjan and danesh yazdi 2020 only few studies reported the opposite situation in which et tends to extract older water than streamflow benettin et al 2020 benettin et al 2017b however in these studies the ket is not clearly identified benettin et al 2017b or the ket value is considered controversial even though it can be identified benettin et al 2020 we argue that the sas modelling result may reflect the reality of the hemuqiao watershed one possibility is related to the so called ecohydrological separation this is consistent to previous study conducted in a mediterranean catchment sprenger et al 2022 ecohydrological separation hypothesis have been reported in various climate regions which suggests that the streamflow and plants tends to have water originated from different water pools in vadose zone immobile water for plant uptake and mobile water for streamflow jia et al 2022 luo et al 2022 ma et al 2021 geris et al 2015 mcdonnell 2014 brooks et al 2010 the previous studies found that the very first rainfall event of wet seasonal can replenish and support the plants over the wet season and subsequent dry seasons xu et al 2019 and most precipitation in wet season become streamflow through large pores and does not contribute to plant water uptake luo et al 2019 this is likely to occur in the hemuqiao watershed because the strong hydrological connectivity can rapidly transport precipitation to streamflow through macro pores especially during the high intensity rainfall events han et al 2020 so the transit time for the streamflow is relatively small water in the small pores is relatively immobile and has longer transit time than that in large pores another possibility is that the plants can take up deeper water below the soil bedrock interface the main vegetation type in this watershed is bamboo and this vegetation not only takes up the soil water from the surface to the soi bedrock interface but also likely takes up the deeper water below the soil bedrock interface han et al 2022 the soil layer on the hillslope mean 1 5 m with soil saturated hydraulic conductivity exponential decreasing along the vertical section results in the age of water below the soil bedrock is relatively older than that in soil water from soil surface to soil bedrock interface han et al 2020 however we cannot exclude the problem similar to what is said in benettin et al 2020 though different tracers are used between our study and their study the isotopic composition in et is not available and the et dynamics have little effect on the isotopic composition in streamflow in this study the evapotranspiration fractionation slightly increases the flow weighted δ18o in streamflow from 6 80 best parameter combination with α et 0 99 to 6 78 best parameter combination with α et 1 i e no fractionation during entire calibration period according to the benettin et al 2017b method the temporal variation of δ18o enrichment in streamflow influenced by et fractionation effect is shown in fig s4 the maximum value of enriched in δ18o in streamflow caused by et fractionation effect is 0 035 which is smaller than the analytical precision with our present data we could not identify which of these three explanations is more realistic this is the limitation of our study that we just fit the δ18o in streamflow and we did not have long term δ18o data of soil and plants to validate the result of the time variant sas model to address this issue the tracer aided conceptual model may be conducted in the future for this watershed to cross validate our result stevenson et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b 6 conclusions in this article the sas approach is applied to explore the time variant transit time distribution as well as the rainfall storage streamflow processes in a moso bamboo watershed results show that the time invariant sas model with a default kq value 0 5 performs nearly as good as the time variant sas model in simulating the dynamic isotopic composition in streamflow for the hemuqiao watershed this implies that the default kq value could be applied to other similar bamboo catchments the performance of the time variant model nse 0 63 is slightly better than that of the time invariant model nse 0 58 implying adding a watershed wetness indicator in the time variant model results in only minor improvement both young water fraction and median age exhibit the marked seasonal variability from the time variant model the median age decreases abruptly within several days at three time periods one is in january 2020 and the other two periods are in meiyu season and has a higher uncertainty than young water fraction the volume weighted young water fraction derived from the time variant sas method appears to be 0 1 larger than that from the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods the difference becomes smaller if young water fraction from the sas method when the age is not volume weighted in addition the young water fraction derived from the time variant sas method has seasonal variation these findings improve our understanding of solute transport processes and nutrient attenuation in moso bamboo watersheds for stream discharge the watershed preferentially releases younger water under high storage conditions during the east asian summer monsoon easm period and the flow weighted gamma distribution fitting predicts that 27 of the streamflow is younger than 7 days which is almost twice of that in the east asian winter monsoon eawm period indicating that event water plays an important role in determining the age composition in streamflow in the easm period this is likely related to the rainfall runoff generation processes in this watershed the larger hourly rainfall intensity in the easm period tends to enhance the direct contribution of event water to streamflow than that in the eawm period evapotranspiration is estimated to extract older water than stream discharge in both the eawm and the easm periods that is likely related to the occurrence of ecohydrological separation and root water uptake below the soil bedrock interface

2402,understanding seasonal variation of the transit time distribution of stream discharge and evapotranspiration is crucial in exploring the flow pathways and the rainfall storage streamflow processes in a watershed of interest here both time variant and time invariant storage selection sas functions were adopted to estimate the transit time distribution in a moso bamboo watershed under the east asian monsoon climate daily stable isotopic compositions δ18o δ2h of precipitation and streamflow at the watershed outlet from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2020 were measured to calibrate the model parameters the time variant sas method considering watershed wetness performs slightly better than the time invariant sas method implying adding a watershed wetness indicator in the time variant model results in only a minor improvement young water fraction and median age as two streamflow age measures were derived from the time variant sas model the median age decreases abruptly within several days at three periods one is in january 2020 and the other two periods are in meiyu season with larger uncertainty while the estimated young water fraction varies gradually with much smaller uncertainty the young water fraction derived from the time variant sas method appears to be more reliable than that estimated by the tracer cycle damping method for stream discharge the storage preferentially releases younger water to discharge under wetter conditions in the east asian summer monsoon easm june september period while this phenomenon does not occur in the east asian winter monsoon eawm october may period the larger hourly rainfall intensity for the whole easm period mean intensity 2 08 mm h likely enhances direct contribution of event water to streamflow than that in the eawm period mean intensity 0 75 mm h the evapotranspiration is estimated to extract older water than stream discharge in both the eawm period and the easm period that is likely related to the occurrence of ecohydrological separation and root water uptake below the soil bedrock interface keywords stable isotopes sas functions young water fraction gamma distribution moso bamboo watershed east asian monsoon region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the transit time i e the time spent by a parcel of water through a watershed from input as precipitation to any of outflows away from the catchment is a variable useful for exploring flow pathways storage dynamics and water sources in a watershed of interest harman 2015 botter et al 2011 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 at any given time a watershed outflow e g stream discharge is composed of water from different parts of the watershed storage via various pathways thus has a wide range of transit times the transit time distribution ttd is the probability density function of water transit time in an outflow and has been widely accepted as a fundamental watershed descriptor of flow pathways and hydrologic processes jing et al 2021 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 another fundamental watershed descriptor residence time distribution rtd is defined as the age distribution of water parcels within the storage that has not yet exited the system these two watershed descriptors are correlated they both integrate flow path heterogeneity and encapsulate the hydrological processes as a function however they are different concepts streamflow is not a uniform mixture of all water stored in the watershed of different ages rodriguez et al 2018 kim et al 2016 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 thus using a lumped watershed residence time for streamflow transit time estimation is problematic for example previous studies have found that a perfect mixing between precipitation and storage within the whole watershed is not adequate to simulate the variation of tracer concentration in outlet discharge knighton et al 2017 hrachowitz et al 2015 thus non uniform distribution models are required for transit time characterization these include time invariant and time variant models in contrast to a time invariant model a time variant model is more suitable to capture short term behavior of a watershed rodriguez et al 2018 benettin et al 2017b hrachowitz et al 2010 for a time invariant model a basic assumption in most previous studies is that the hydrologic system is in a steady state condition therefore the long term releasing processes from the storage to outlet discharge can be characterized by a hydrological time invariant transit time distribution for example a gamma distribution mcguire et al 2005 kirchner et al 2000 an exponential distribution ogrinc et al 2018 or an advection dispersion equation mosquera et al 2016 wienhöfer et al 2009 however the limitations of the time invariant models are obvious i e temporal variations in flow pathways storage dynamics and hydrometeorological forcing are ignored a time variant model is favored in recent studies because of its better performance and more information about the timing and magnitude of peak tracer fluxes stockinger et al 2014 hrachowitz et al 2010 many time variant models have been successfully used in simulating the temporal variation of tracers in streamflow they include the tracer aided conceptual model stevenson et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b lagrangian particle tracking model jing et al 2021 and storage selection function sas zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2020 harman 2015 the functions of the sas model have recently been developed to relate the age structure in storage and outflow under transient conditions in which a master equation me is solved to express the relationship between residence time distribution and transit time distribution botter et al 2011 once the relationship between age distribution of storage and outflow has been established the water and solute transport processes can also be identified the sas functions form a parsimonious lumped model which spatially integrates the flow pathways and hydrological processes into a unified framework therefore the parameters of an sas model are the lumped representation of the tracer transport processes in a watershed an sas model can be applied in either a time invariant or time variant manner the time variant sas model has been applied to effectively simulate the rainfall storage streamflow processes at the watershed scale sprenger et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 fang et al 2019 benettin et al 2017b they have been tested on artificial hillslopes kim et al 2022 kim and harman 2022 and lysimeter experiments meira neto et al 2022 kim et al 2016 on the other hand the time invariant sas model with a default parameter kq 0 5 which determines the affinity of discharge for relatively younger or older water in storage seems to work well in the brundtland burn catchment benettin et al 2017b one problem in applying an sas model is that the equifinality of different parameter sets can result in the deviation between the simulation and reality sprenger et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 kirchner 2019 thus higher resolution isotopic composition data of streamflow and other water compartments are required to provide more detailed information for the hydrological models and to decrease the parameter uncertainty young water fraction has been widely used as one representative age metric of streamflow when using the sas models benettin et al 2020 kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b young water fraction is defined as the fraction of streamflow younger than a threshold age and can be estimated from a simple using amplitude ratio as ap and a complex using phase shift φ s φ p tracer cycle damping method or derived from transit time models kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b young water fraction generally shows the seasonal variation when it derived from a time variant transit time model but it is a fixed value when it estimated from a simple or a complex tracer cycle damping method benettin et al 2020 comparing young water fraction estimated from these three methods is worth investigating for improving understanding of the solute transport processes in a watershed of interest median age defined as the age which is smaller than that of 50 water particles is another representative age metric of streamflow when using the sas models rodriguez et al 2018 benettin et al 2017b benettin et al 2015 the median age is more easily derived from transit time models than that of young water fraction because the threshold age of young water fraction needs to be obtained from another method for estimating young water fraction in general both metrics are independent of the older water components as they do not need to specify maximum age which is highly uncertain in most estimation approaches benettin et al 2017b previous studies have used one of the two to represent relative age of streamflow zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2020 rodriguez et al 2018 harman 2015 however which one has lower uncertainty has not been discussed in previous studies benettin et al 2017a in this study an sas model is applied to investigate the flow pathways and rainfall storage streamflow processes in moso bamboo watershed moso bamboo phyllostachys edulis a temperate species is widely distributed in subtropical regions and native to china li and feng 2019 the area of moso bamboo coverage in china is approximately 4 67 mha accounting for 70 of the total bamboo forest area in china and approximately 16 of global bamboo forest area zhang et al 2019a the area of moso bamboo continues to increase at a rate of 3 annually in china due to its rapid growth rate high economic benefits and ecological benefits li et al 2013 this change has caused some concerns given that the area expansion of moso bamboo and changes in vegetation types may alter the hydrological processes and water balance at the watershed scale shinohara et al 2019 ide et al 2010 previous studies have found that the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in a moso bamboo watershed tends to be larger than that in other types of vegetation cover and lateral subsurface flow seems to be more common than in other forests zhou et al 2012 ide et al 2010 wang and liu 1995 although several studies have explored hydrological processes by monitoring mass fluxes of water and selected constituents in moso bamboo watersheds han et al 2021 han et al 2020 the age distribution of evapotranspiration water and stream discharge is not well understood for such watersheds these age distributions if known could provide insights into solute transport processes and improve understanding of nutrient attenuation they can be estimated by long term and high resolution tracer s data of precipitation and streamflow in a watershed of interest benettin et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the subtropical regions in china are entirely controlled by east asian monsoon characterized by hot and humid in the east asian summer monsoon period and cold and dry in the east asian winter monsoon period the hydrologic response of a watershed to the precipitation are quite different under different monsoon periods because of the seasonal variation of rainfall intensity han et al 2020 watershed wetness han et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b and evapotranspiration zhang et al 2019a in addition previous studies on hydrologic transit time using time invariant models e g a lumped parameter convolution method could not explore the factors determining the seasonal variation of water ages in the east asian monsoon region dai et al 2022 hu et al 2020 in this study seasonal variation of transit time distribution is investigated using a time variant sas model the stable isotopic compositions of precipitation groundwater streamflow at multiple locations soil water at different depths from continuous sampling with regular time interval from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2020 and two field campaigns were used to investigate flow pathways storage dynamics and water sources in a moso bamboo watershed in the subtropical region the objectives of this research are to 1 investigate the seasonal variation of transit time distribution of streamflow and evapotranspiration 2 examine the suitability of the published default parameter kq of the time invariant sas model for the studied watershed 3 compare young water fraction estimated from the time variant sas model and the tracer cycle damping method 4 analyze the uncertainty of young water fraction and median age from the time variant sas method 2 study area the hemuqiao watershed 119 47 e 30 34 n is a 1 35 km2 subbasin of taihu basin located northwest of zhejiang province in the lower reach of the yangtze river and is surrounded by low hilly terrain fig 1 the climate is controlled by the east asian monsoon with two distinct monsoon periods hot and humid in the east asian summer monsoon period easm june september and cold and dry in the east asian winter monsoon period eawm october may there are two active rainy seasons in the lower reach of yangtze river during the easm period meiyu season june mid july and typhoon season july september chen 2004 the average annual temperature is 14 and average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration are 1580 mm and 805 mm respectively liu et al 2012 the topography of the hemuqiao watershed has an altitudinal range of 160 to 600 m a s l with an average slope of 36 table 1 topographic wetness index twi ranges from 0 to 17 3 with an overall average of 1 87 the drainage density is about 9 30 km km2 based on dem data with a 1 m 1 m resolution and a flow accumulation threshold of 10000 the study area is mostly composed of devonian quartz sandstone han et al 2016 and moso bamboo is the dominant vegetable type han et al 2022 liu et al 2012 sandy loam sand and loamy sand soil are the dominant soil texture types according to the united states department of agriculture usda classification system they account for 42 62 29 51 and 18 03 of total watershed area han et al 2016 respectively soil depth is less than 1 5 m on hillslopes and increases sharply to 2 5 m in the valley han et al 2021 the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of topsoil e g 0 40 cm is about 150 mm h fig s1 and declines exponentially with soil depth the ks of soil near the bedrock soil interface is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the topsoil han et al 2020 the hemuqiao watershed can be divided into four sub watersheds namely g1 g2 g3 and gs based on the dem data watershed areas fig 1 range from 0 05 to 0 93 km2 and the watershed characteristics are summarized in table 1 the topographic gradient twi and drainage density of each sub watershed are similar with those of the overall watershed g4 the soil texture of g1 g2 gs is quite different for g1 sandy loam is the dominant soil type but for g2 and gs the proportion of sandy loam soil is very small fig 1 3 methods 3 1 hydrometeorological observation and field sampling 3 1 1 hydrometeorological observation at the hemuqiao watershed outlet g4 a v notch weir was established an hobo u20 water level logger onset computer corporation bourne mam usa with a time interval of 5 min was equipped in this weir to automatically record water level in addition to the discharge data meteorological data was also obtained from a meteorological station near the watershed outlet fig 1 including temperature relative humidity and wind with a time interval of 6 min daily free water surface evaporation data was obtained from hangzhou meteorological station 50 km away from the study area free water surface evaporation et0 observation adopted the national standard using a pan evaporator e601b model in the meteorological station zhang et al 2019a reported the annual actual evapotranspiration values in a moso bamboo watershed 18 km away from our study watershed from 2012 to 2014 based on an eddy covariance system the average ratio of actual evapotranspiration using eddy covariance measurement to free water surface evaporation in hangzhou meteorological station approximately equal to 0 78 from 2012 to 2014 thus the actual evapotranspiration et was estimated to be 0 78 et0 the discharge precipitation and actual evapotranspiration data were available from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2020 for soil volumetric water content vwc data three ech2o ec 5 volumetric water content sensors meter group inc pullman wa usa were installed in a soil pit in the upper reach of this watershed fig 1 the probes were located at 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm soil bedrock interface with a 6 min sampling interval the vwc data of different soil depth was measured from 24 may 2019 to 31 december 2020 3 1 2 long term sampling in addition to the hydrometeorological data stable isotope data of different water sources were measured at a regular time interval and two field campaigns were conducted during the study period for the continuous isotope data precipitation and watershed outlet streamflow were sampled daily and the g1 g2 and g3 streamflow were sampled weekly from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2020 weekly groundwater sampling was conducted in a groundwater well 2 5 m deep in the middle reach of this watershed from 1 january 2019 to 31 december 2020 but the groundwater level was not recorded 3 1 3 flood event sampling two sampling campaigns meiyu from 17 06 2019 to 07 07 2019 and typhoon rainfall from 07 08 2019 to 16 08 2019 were focused on the watershed response to two wetting episodes in the summer of 2019 samples of precipitation were collected during each wetting episode soil water streamflow and groundwater were sampled prior to each episode to represent antecedent water hourly precipitation was collected in the middle reach of watershed about 220 m sea level height and were transferred into 30 ml polyethylene vials hourly streamflow samplings were collected from g1 g2 gs and watershed outlet g4 all hourly samplings were conducted in the daytime from 8 00 to 18 00 during these two rainfall events daily groundwater was collected at 8 00 every day distributed and stratified 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil samples were collected in a soil profile on a hillslope fig 1 at 8 00 and 18 00 every day sealed in ziplock bags and placed in coolers for transport 3 1 4 stable isotope analysis the collected soil samples were extracted using a fully automatic cryogenic vacuum extraction system li 2100 automatic water extraction system lica united technology soil water samples were extracted for 90 min at a high temperature of 105 to ensure that the bulk water in the soil samples was completely extracted west et al 2006 all water samples were filtered with 0 22 μm filter paper into 2 ml vials the stable isotopic compositions of δ18o and δ2h were measured with thermo fishher mat 253 in the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering in hohai university repeated analysis of every water sample for 6 times and the first three results were deleted to minimize the memory of machine the arithmetic mean of the last three results was used to represent the sample isotopic composition analytical precision for δ18o and δ2h was 0 1 and 2 respectively 3 2 the storage selection sas approach and calibration this study adopted the age ranked storage st to label the volumes of precipitation that entered the watershed at different times in the past and have not been released yet benettin et al 2017b harman 2015 the time varying age ranked storage is the volume of water storage younger than a given age kim et al 2022 harman 2015 when assigning each outflow discharge or evapotranspiration an appropriate sas function the time evolution of relationship between the age ranked water in storage and in outflow can be identified benettin et al 2017b harman 2015 1 s t t t t s t t t t j t q t ω q s t t t t e t t ω et s t t t t where j t q t and et t is precipitation discharge and evapotranspiration at time t respectively s t t t is the volume in the storage younger than t at time t ω q s t t ω et s t t is the sas function and represent the fraction of total discharge evapotranspiration which is produced by s t t t at any time t in this study power law shaped functions are used to express the sas function ω q s t t and ω et s t t zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2017b queloz et al 2015 2 ω q s t t s t t t s t k q 3 ω et s t t s t t t s t k et the kq 0 and ket 0 determine the affinity of discharge and evapotranspiration for relatively younger or older water in storage benettin and bertuzzo 2018 kq 1 represents random sampling where the water with different ages completely mixed in the storage kq less than 1 kq 1 implies more proportion of younger water older water in the storage releases for discharge the same explanation applies to ket both the time variant and time invariant models are tested in this study here the time invariant model represents that both kq and ket are constant in the time variant model kq changes between two end members kq1 and kq2 over time benettin et al 2017b the interpolation between two end numbers is related to watershed wetness ws which can be expressed as a function of discharge that is because the discharge is closely related to the watershed storage and discharge data is more accessible than storage data kirchner 2009 4 w s t q t q min q max q min 5 k q t k q 1 1 w s t k q 2 k q 1 where qmax and qmin represent the maximum and minimum discharge during the study period q t represents the discharge at time t kq1 and kq2 are two parameters which determine the range of kq the discharge and evapotranspiration age distribution can be obtained from eq 1 and expressed as following zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2017b 6 p q t t ω q s t t s t t 7 p et t t ω et s t t s t t where p q t t and p et t t represent the age distribution in discharge and evapotranspiration respectively ω q s t t and ω et s t t are the probability density function of ω q s t t and ω et s t t respectively eqs 6 and 7 express that how the age ranked storage releases for the discharge and evapotranspiration the same selection process can be used to describe the stable isotopic compositions that are released from the storage to discharge and evapotranspiration the stable isotopic compositions in discharge c q t and evapotranspiration c et t can be expressed in the following equations 8 c q t 0 c s s t t ω q s t t d s t 9 c et t 0 c s s t t ω et s t t d s t where c s s t t represents the stable isotopic compositions of storage s t t t it is worth noting that evaporation is depleted in heavy isotopic compositions compared to storage this depletion causes the remaining water in storage enriched in heavy isotopic compositions benettin et al 2017b in general plant water uptake does not cause isotopic fractionation xiao et al 2018 it is difficult for us to divide the evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration based on our current investigation data thus in this study we lump evaporation and transpiration fluxes together queloz et al 2015 according to the water mass and isotope mass balance the isotopic compositions of age ranked storage can be expressed as zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2017b 10 d δ s t t t i dt 1 α et e t t t i ω et s t t t i δ s t t t i where ti is the time step and α et is the fractionation factor the initial ranges of the parameters kq1 kq2 ket for the time variant model and kq ket for the time invariant model were set according to the previous study table 2 benettin et al 2017b the α et was set to 0 9 1 larger than that of 0 95 1 used by benettin et al 2017b because evapotranspiration in our watershed 800 mm yr 1 is much larger than that in bruntland burn catchment 400 mm yr 1 sprenger et al 2017 for initial watershed storage s0 the upper bound was estimated according to the maximum soil depth about 1 5 m on hillslopes and 2 5 m in the valley multiplied by the average porosity of 40 plus water stored in the fractured rock below the soil bedrock interface 170 mm han et al 2021 the upper bound of s0 is similar with the storage derived from water balance in a nearby moso bamboo watershed 18 km away from our watershed zhang et al 2019a the isotopic composition δ18o of initial st was assumed to be the long term flow weighted average δ18o in discharge 6 52 during the study period the model was primed using the data from 1 october 2017 to 31 december 2018 and then fit with the measured δ18o in outlet streamflow from 1 january 2019 to 31 december 2020 calibration period a total of 100 000 parameter groups were randomly generated from the initial ranges using the monte carlo approach table 2 the model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the nse is sensitive to time series peaks stockinger et al 2016 nash and sutcliffe 1970 only the 200 parameter groups with the highest nse values were retained for analyzing the uncertainty of each parameter 95 confidence interval table 2 the age distributions derived from the sas model at any time steps can be fitted by a gamma distribution function following benettin et al 2017b the gamma distribution function can be used to characterize the long term releasing processes from the storage to the discharge and et as well as to estimate the mean transit time a similar monte carlo approach was also used to assess the uncertainty of gamma distribution function fitting and the initial ranges of shape parameter αsas and scale parameter βsas were set to 0 1 and 0 2000 respectively 3 3 young water fraction calculation the young water fraction can be accurately predicted by using the relationship between seasonal tracer cycles of precipitation and streamflow kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b it can be calculated from the cumulative transit time distribution if the threshold age of young water fraction of a watershed is known in this study the young water fraction fyw was estimated using three methods including the simple tracer cycle damping method the complex tracer cycle damping method and a derivation from the time variant sas model the time variant method requires threshold age which is estimated by the complex tracer cycle damping method to calculate young water fraction both the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods use sine waves to fit time series of δ18o in precipitation and outlet discharge by using the iteratively reweighted least squares method respectively in

statistics 24 4 results 4 1 hydrologic and isotopic characterization precipitation in the hemuqiao watershed is unevenly distributed throughout the year in the easm period precipitation accounts for 56 9 of its annual precipitation with high evapotranspiration rates 2 61 mm day fig 2 in the eawm period monthly mean precipitation 77 8 mm month is less than that in the easm period 210 mm month and the daily evapotranspiration 1 44 mm day is relatively less than that in the easm period the mean annual runoff coefficient during the study period is 0 51 and the hydrograph in the watershed outlet exhibits a flashy response to precipitation even during the dry period the isotopic composition δ18o in precipitation ranges from 11 53 to 4 06 is relatively more variable throughout the year than that in outlet streamflow ranges from 8 86 to 3 54 fig 3 table 3 in the monsoon transition period from the eawm period to the easm period there is a decreasing trend of δ18o values in precipitation from may to june the beginning of meiyu season fig 3 precipitation gradually enriched in heavy isotope at the beginning of the eawm period the δ18o in outlet streamflow shows a similar seasonal variation with δ18o in precipitation in addition the volume weighted δ18o in streamflow 6 52 is slightly less negative than amount weighted δ18o in precipitation 6 66 during the study period however this difference is very minor the local meteoric water line lmwl was established based on the monthly amount weighted mean isotopic compositions in the hemuqiao watershed fig 4 table 3 δ2h 8 08 δ18o 10 38 n 27 r2 0 91 the slope and intercept of lwml are similar with those of global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 and the slope and intercept for linear regressions between δ2h and δ18o in streamflow at multiple locations and groundwater are relatively lower than those of lmwl table 3 fig 4 an analysis of covariance ancova on the relationship between δ2h and δ18o shows significant difference between precipitation and streamflow at multiple locations p 0 001 and there is insignificant difference between groundwater and streamflow at multiple locations p 0 476 both δ2h and δ18o in groundwater and streamflow at multiple locations exhibit significant positive linear relationship respectively r 0 85 p 0 01 table 4 4 2 performance of the time variant and time invariant sas models the results of posterior distribution of the time variant and the time invariant model parameters are shown in fig 5 and summarized in table 2 for the parameter ket and s0 of these two models the ranges mean values and the standard deviations are very similar table 2 and these parameters are clearly identified fig 5 the mean ket for both models is 0 7 which is less than 1 indicating the et flux tends to extract water of younger age the mean fractionation parameter α et for both models are 0 99 implying et flux only leads to very minor enrichment in heavy isotope in storage the initial storage parameter s0 for both models are approximated to 750 mm in addition the parameter kq for time invariant model is clearly identified and the optimal parameter is 0 51 this value is very close to a previous investigation of the bruntland burn catchment which has an optimal parameter kq of 0 5 benettin et al 2017b this result shows that the default kq of 0 5 also applies for the hemuqiao watershed as for the time variant model the kq2 is clearly identified optimal value is 0 49 but the kq1 is an insensitive parameter and could not clearly be identified optimal value is 0 39 nevertheless given that kq1 under wet condition is supposed to be smaller than kq2 for dry condition the optimal value of 0 39 seems to be reasonable the maximum objective function value of nse for the time variant 0 63 model is slightly larger than that of the time invariant model 0 58 indicating that the time invariant model seems to work well and adding a watershed wetness indicator in the time variant models results in a minor improvement fig 5 in this study we focus more on the results from the time variant model to explore the response of δ18o in streamflow to the δ18o in the precipitation inputs the daily measured and simulated δ18o in outlet streamflow using the time variant sas approach are shown in fig 6 the result shows that the model is able to capture the dynamics of the measured δ18o in streamflow with nse 0 63 for the calibration period the model was able to reproduce the δ18o peaks in late may every year and unusually lowest δ18o values measured in streamflow in super typhoon lekima 08 09 2019 11 08 2019 can also be well reproduced fig 6 however the simulated streamflow is more depleted in heavy isotopic composition than that measured in streamflow from january to may in 2019 the most likely explanation for this is that the extraordinary evaporation in 2018 may lead to a systemic shift in the initial conditions in the simulated storage 4 3 young water fraction estimated by three methods young water fraction as an age metric of streamflow is examined in this study based on the two tracer cycle damping methods the threshold ages of young water estimated from different time periods entire study period or calibration period are consistent but the young water fractions calculated from these two periods are quite different for entire study period the threshold age of young water is estimated to be 51 days with an uncertainty range of 47 56 days according to the complex tracer cycle damping method kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b table 5 young water fraction ranges from 23 to 35 with an average of 29 according to the complex tracer cycle damping method applying the simple tracer cycle damping method the young water fraction ranges from 21 to 33 with an average of 27 young water fraction obtained by these two methods are similar around 28 when we just calculate the young water fraction using the data from 1 january 2019 to 31 december 2020 calibration period the threshold age for young water fraction is similar to the result calculated by the entire study period however the young water fraction based on calibration period data estimated by the complex tracer cycle damping method ranges from 32 to 50 with an average of 41 and the simple tracer cycle damping method ranges from 29 to 46 with an average of 39 are both higher than the young water fraction estimated based on the whole study period the age distribution calculated at any time in the time variant sas modelling can be used to obtain the young water fraction τyw 51 days and median age of the streamflow at the corresponding time step the temporal variation of young water fraction and median age are shown in fig 7 the volume weighted young water fraction of the best parameter combination kq1 0 39 kq2 0 49 ket 0 72 s0 790 mm α et 0 99 is 51 which is larger than those estimated by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping method about 40 in addition both young water fraction and median age derived from the sas model exhibit the notable seasonal variability with relatively high young water fraction mean value 53 and low median age mean 43 days in the easm period relatively low young water fraction mean value 35 and large median age mean 93 days in the eawm period fig 7 4 4 comparison of time variant sas derived young water fraction and median age there is a significant negative correlation between young water fraction and median age over the entire study period r 0 781 p 0 001 and the negative correlation is more significant in the easm period r 0 790 p 0 001 than that in the eawm period r 0 550 p 0 001 in the meiyu season a sharp decrease in the median age from 100 days to 20 days within several days and the young water fraction gradually increases from 45 to 65 within about a month another sharp decrease in the median age occurs in late january 2020 the median age decreases from 140 days to 60 days but the young water fraction does not follow a gradual increasing trend as for the meiyu season fig 7 mean vwc in these two periods are high 30 indicating that the watershed is in wet condition in addition to the sharp decrease in the median age the cv values of median age at most time steps 484 731 days are relatively higher than those of young water fraction fig 8 the higher cv value is the larger uncertainty in the corresponding age metrics of streamflow is in general the uncertainty in median age in the eawm period cv 0 15 is less than that in the easm period cv 0 21 and the uncertainty in young water fraction the eawm period cv 0 07 the easm period cv 0 10 is less than that of the median age in both the easm period and the easm period 4 5 the seasonal variation of transit time distribution 4 5 1 seasonal variation of the storage effect the storage effect refers to the proportional water of different ages in the output in comparison to the watershed storage two types of storage effects are defined in the literature which are the direct and inverse storage effects the direct storage effect means an increase of old water fraction in discharge under high storage conditions while the inverse storage effect means an increase of young water fraction in discharge under high storage conditions harman 2015 previous studies suggested that these two effects are closely related to the hydrologic flow pathways temporal dynamics of connectivity and runoff generation mechanisms zhang et al 2021 rodriguez et al 2018 kim et al 2016 harman 2015 in this study we explore the inverse storage effect by establishing the relationship between storage and young water fraction rather than the median age the positive relationship between storage and young water fraction suggests an inverse storage effect and the negative relationship indicates a direct storage effect no significant relationship is shown between storage and young water fraction in the eawm period r 0 017 p 0 798 apparent positive correlation between storage and young water fraction in the easm period r 0 175 p 0 006 suggests that the watershed preferentially releases younger water to discharge under high storage conditions 4 5 2 transit time distribution in stream discharge and evapotranspiration water the flow weighted gamma fitting of stream discharge in the easm and the eawm period from the best parameter combination are shown in fig 9 and the ranges of parameters and mean transit time from the flow weighted calculations are summarized in table 6 for the eawm period flow weighted mean transit time ranges from 139 to 171 days with an average of 153 days for the easm period the flow weighted mean transit time ranges from 104 to 135 days with an average of 119 days in addition the flow weighted gamma distribution fitting predicts that 27 of the streamflow is younger than 7 days flood usually last 3 7 days which is almost twice of that in the eawm period 15 indicating the event water plays an important role in determining the age ranked water in streamflow more details of the event water transport processes in the easm period are included in the section 4 5 3 the flux weighted gamma distribution fitting was also conducted to estimate the mean transit time of et in the eawm and the easm period respectively fig 9 table 6 in general the flux weighted mean transit time of et is larger than that of streamflow both in the eawm and the easm period for the eawm period flux weighted mean transit time ranges from 184 to 217 days with an average of 203 days for the easm period flux weighted mean transit time ranges from 147 to 183 days with an average of 165 days in addition the flux weighted gamma distribution fitting predicts that 17 of the et is younger than 7 days in the easm period which is almost three times larger than that in the eawm period 4 9 in addition the event water fraction in et is less than those in streamflow both in the eawm and the easm period 4 5 3 watershed hydrological response and stable isotopic characteristic sub daily isotopic compositions in various water sources were used to investigate the watershed hydrological response to two wetting episodes in the hemuqiao watershed in 2019 one is a meiyu episode and the other is a typhoon episode fig 10 table s1 the first sampling campaign was conducted during a meiyu episode occurring on 17 june to 7 july 2019 fig 10 the precipitation was 248 8 mm and the peak rainfall intensity was 34 mm h table s1 the streamflow at multiple locations and groundwater depleted in heavy isotope of oxygen as the discharge first increased and δ18o in outlet streamflow reached the minimum value at 11 00 21st june after 140 mm rainfall then these water sources showed relatively stable δ18o values range from 6 to 8 the isotopic compositions in soil water at different depths exhibited similar temporal variation person correlation between soil water at different depths are shown in table s2 r 0 55 p less than 0 01 the mean δ18o in soil water reached the minimum value 8 67 at the same days as that in outlet streamflow the second sampling campaign was conducted during a typhoon episode super typhoon lekima occurring on 7th august 2019 fig 10 the precipitation was 189 3 mm over 50 h with a low peak rainfall intensity 13 8 mm h table s1 the streamwater at multiple locations and groundwater depleted in heavy isotope of oxygen as the discharge increased and δ18o in outlet streamflow reached the minimum value at 9 00 11th august then these water sources showed relatively stable δ18o values in a small range of 7 10 the isotopic compositions in soil water at different depths also exhibited similar temporal variation table s2 r 0 86 p 0 01 the mean δ18o in soil water reached the minimal value 12 78 at the same time as that in outlet streamflow 5 discussion 5 1 difference in the estimated young water fraction from the three methods in this study we found that young water fraction has a lower uncertainty than median age derived from the time variant sas model fig 8 we also found that the young water fractions estimated by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods using isotope data of calibration period are approximately 41 which is larger than the previous studies conducted in the east asian monsoon region dai et al 2022 hu et al 2020 jasechko et al 2016 the lower topographic wetness index associated with higher drainage density in the hemuqiao watershed mean twi 1 87 mean drainage density 9 30 km km2 lead to a higher young water fraction than other watershed in zhejiang province mean twi 6 35 mean drainage density 2 28 km km2 young water fraction 0 33 hu et al 2020 von freyberg et al 2018 the seasonal variation of young water fraction cannot be revealed by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods which is considered one limitation of these methods kirchner 2016a kirchner 2016b however the seasonal variation of young water fraction can be estimated by the time variant sas model and the volume weighted young water fraction 51 obtained from the sas model is larger than that estimated by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods using isotope data of the period 41 these three young water fractions calculated by different methods are comparable on the basis of having the same threshold age and the threshold age of young water is selected according to the complex tracer cycle damping method the threshold age of young water is insensitive to tracer data of different periods and sampling frequency according to kirchner method kirchner 2016a stockinger et al 2016 table 5 so the threshold age of young water for these three methods is reasonable the uncertainty in the estimated young water fraction is considered another limitation of the cycle damping method table 5 shows the interannual variation of isotopic compositions in precipitation leads to differences in estimated young water fractions using simple and complex tracer cycle damping gallart et al 2020 for example the amount weighted δ18o in precipitation from october to december in 2018 is 8 61 which is more negative than that in other years 5 08 in 2017 5 55 in 2019 6 58 in 2020 so the wave trough of sine wave fitting using precipitation isotope data of the entire study period 8 75 is lower than that using isotope data of calibration period 8 07 this results in different young water fractions estimated based on the tracer data of the calibration period 40 and that of the entire study period 30 kirchner 2016a b another piece of evidence is that the volume unweighted young water fraction obtained from the time variant sas model is about 40 which is similar with the results estimated by the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods in general the young water fraction derived from the time variant sas model is more reliable the tracer cycle damping methods provide estimation of young water fraction only for one threshold age this threshold age does not necessarily align well with those of the processes of interest in contrast the time variant sas model can provide estimation of water fraction for any age thresholds making it more flexible for investigating watershed processes benettin et al 2020 for example factors controlling solute transport in event scale can be revealed using a small threshold age less than 1 week benettin et al 2017a this study the weathering processes of si can be investigated using a threshold age of 2 weeks calibrated kinetic constant for si benettin et al 2017a investigation of long term fate of nitrate removal process requires a large threshold age e g 1 year guillaumot et al 2021 5 2 preferential release of younger water to summer discharge under wetter conditions in the moso bamboo watershed under the east asian monsoon climate the inverse storage effect exists during the easm period however this effect does not occur during the eawm period which is similar with a previous study conducted in a karst catchment in the east asian monsoon region zhang et al 2021 the flow weighted gamma distribution suggests that 27 of the streamflow is younger than 7 days during the easm period which is almost two times of that in the eawm period 15 this result is consistent with previous studies which suggest that the event water plays an important role in determining the inverse storage effect zhang et al 2021 benettin et al 2017b harman 2015 another piece of evidence is that the difference of event water proportion 12 accounts for 2 3 of the difference of young water fraction 18 between the easm period and the eawm period fig 9 isotopic composition data of a high sampling frequency streamflow and other water sources in two wetting episodes in 2019 are used to explore how the event water rapidly contributes to the streamflow during the easm period fig 10 the different soil types in each sub watershed do not cause the significant difference in isotopic compositions in streamflow at multiple locations from both weekly and sub daily sampling frequencies fig 3 fig 10 table 4 the spatial differences in soil types generally lead to the spatial difference in saturated hydraulic conductivity in this watershed the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from 34 to 161 mm h with an average of 101 mm h fig s1 the lowest soil saturated hydraulic conductivity is close to the maximum precipitation intensity 34 6 mm h in 26 july 2018 during the study period indicating that the hortonian overland flow rarely occurs in this watershed and the heterogeneous soil types have little effect on runoff generation mechanism in different sub watersheds in addition isotopic compositions in soil water at different depths exhibit similar temporal variation at the event scale implying that subsurface flow in the soil above the soil bedrock interface is mainly vertical furthermore more depleted in heavy isotopic composition of oxygen in soil water than that in groundwater and streamflow suggests that precipitation and pre event water have been well mixed as soil water transfers to groundwater and streamflow through the soil bedrock interface han et al 2020 2021 fig 10 this is also supported by prior findings that the tracer signals from different parts of the catchment become well mixed within the valley bottoms lazo et al 2019 mosquera et al 2016 the difference of event water proportion between the eawm and the easm period are very likely associated with the hourly rainfall intensity and the different hourly rainfall intensity generally leads to difference in flow pathways of a watershed of interest xiao et al 2022 han et al 2020 yang and chu 2013 in the easm period the large hourly rainfall intensity generally leads to high event water proportion in streamflow while in the eawm period the small hourly rainfall intensity 0 75 mm h does not trigger preferential flow as much as that in the easm period the hydrological processes in the hemuqiao watershed were dominated by subsurface saturation excess during heavy rainfall events han et al 2020 liu et al 2012 the mean hourly rainfall intensity for the whole time in the eawm period 0 75 mm h is less than that of the easm period 2 08 mm h fig 11 indicating the larger hourly rainfall intensity in the easm period tend to facilitate mobilization event water to streamflow than that in the eawm period 5 3 evapotranspiration extracting older water than streamflow in this study the parameter for et ket is clearly identified from both the time variant and time invariant models in addition the correlation coefficients between ket and other parameters of 200 best parameter combinations is relatively low less than 0 3 both in time invariant and time variant sas model fig s2 fig s3 the fitted ket in both models is larger than parameter kq implying that et tends to extract older water than stream discharge fig 5 table 2 consistently the mean transit time of et are larger than those of streamflow both in the eawm and the easm periods table 6 it is widely accepted that the et tends to extract younger water from storage compared to streamflow zhang et al 2021 asenjan and danesh yazdi 2020 visser et al 2019 harman 2015 because the evaporation from topsoil and transpiration from plants tend to release younger water from storage as long as they are available to them asenjan and danesh yazdi 2020 only few studies reported the opposite situation in which et tends to extract older water than streamflow benettin et al 2020 benettin et al 2017b however in these studies the ket is not clearly identified benettin et al 2017b or the ket value is considered controversial even though it can be identified benettin et al 2020 we argue that the sas modelling result may reflect the reality of the hemuqiao watershed one possibility is related to the so called ecohydrological separation this is consistent to previous study conducted in a mediterranean catchment sprenger et al 2022 ecohydrological separation hypothesis have been reported in various climate regions which suggests that the streamflow and plants tends to have water originated from different water pools in vadose zone immobile water for plant uptake and mobile water for streamflow jia et al 2022 luo et al 2022 ma et al 2021 geris et al 2015 mcdonnell 2014 brooks et al 2010 the previous studies found that the very first rainfall event of wet seasonal can replenish and support the plants over the wet season and subsequent dry seasons xu et al 2019 and most precipitation in wet season become streamflow through large pores and does not contribute to plant water uptake luo et al 2019 this is likely to occur in the hemuqiao watershed because the strong hydrological connectivity can rapidly transport precipitation to streamflow through macro pores especially during the high intensity rainfall events han et al 2020 so the transit time for the streamflow is relatively small water in the small pores is relatively immobile and has longer transit time than that in large pores another possibility is that the plants can take up deeper water below the soil bedrock interface the main vegetation type in this watershed is bamboo and this vegetation not only takes up the soil water from the surface to the soi bedrock interface but also likely takes up the deeper water below the soil bedrock interface han et al 2022 the soil layer on the hillslope mean 1 5 m with soil saturated hydraulic conductivity exponential decreasing along the vertical section results in the age of water below the soil bedrock is relatively older than that in soil water from soil surface to soil bedrock interface han et al 2020 however we cannot exclude the problem similar to what is said in benettin et al 2020 though different tracers are used between our study and their study the isotopic composition in et is not available and the et dynamics have little effect on the isotopic composition in streamflow in this study the evapotranspiration fractionation slightly increases the flow weighted δ18o in streamflow from 6 80 best parameter combination with α et 0 99 to 6 78 best parameter combination with α et 1 i e no fractionation during entire calibration period according to the benettin et al 2017b method the temporal variation of δ18o enrichment in streamflow influenced by et fractionation effect is shown in fig s4 the maximum value of enriched in δ18o in streamflow caused by et fractionation effect is 0 035 which is smaller than the analytical precision with our present data we could not identify which of these three explanations is more realistic this is the limitation of our study that we just fit the δ18o in streamflow and we did not have long term δ18o data of soil and plants to validate the result of the time variant sas model to address this issue the tracer aided conceptual model may be conducted in the future for this watershed to cross validate our result stevenson et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b 6 conclusions in this article the sas approach is applied to explore the time variant transit time distribution as well as the rainfall storage streamflow processes in a moso bamboo watershed results show that the time invariant sas model with a default kq value 0 5 performs nearly as good as the time variant sas model in simulating the dynamic isotopic composition in streamflow for the hemuqiao watershed this implies that the default kq value could be applied to other similar bamboo catchments the performance of the time variant model nse 0 63 is slightly better than that of the time invariant model nse 0 58 implying adding a watershed wetness indicator in the time variant model results in only minor improvement both young water fraction and median age exhibit the marked seasonal variability from the time variant model the median age decreases abruptly within several days at three time periods one is in january 2020 and the other two periods are in meiyu season and has a higher uncertainty than young water fraction the volume weighted young water fraction derived from the time variant sas method appears to be 0 1 larger than that from the simple and complex tracer cycle damping methods the difference becomes smaller if young water fraction from the sas method when the age is not volume weighted in addition the young water fraction derived from the time variant sas method has seasonal variation these findings improve our understanding of solute transport processes and nutrient attenuation in moso bamboo watersheds for stream discharge the watershed preferentially releases younger water under high storage conditions during the east asian summer monsoon easm period and the flow weighted gamma distribution fitting predicts that 27 of the streamflow is younger than 7 days which is almost twice of that in the east asian winter monsoon eawm period indicating that event water plays an important role in determining the age composition in streamflow in the easm period this is likely related to the rainfall runoff generation processes in this watershed the larger hourly rainfall intensity in the easm period tends to enhance the direct contribution of event water to streamflow than that in the eawm period evapotranspiration is estimated to extract older water than stream discharge in both the eawm and the easm periods that is likely related to the occurrence of ecohydrological separation and root water uptake below the soil bedrock interface

a critical component of the hydrological cycle and plays a key role in the redistribution of global energy and water accurate estimation of et enables the quantification of surface water and energy budgets prediction of extreme events e g floods and droughts and diagnosis of climate change fisher et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 in situ measurement techniques such as lysimeters eddy covariance ec large aperture scintillometers las and the bowen ratio method provide credible observations to monitor et at site and local scales fisher et al 2011 however the relatively high cost and small spatial fetch of these instruments limit their temporal and spatial coverages compared to meteorological variables and pose a challenge to the representativeness of these site scale observations for large scale heterogeneous land surfaces especially for data sparse regions allen et al 2011 jiménez et al 2011 owing to the limitations of in situ measurement and a desire for creating a more universal approach a variety of models based on diverse mechanisms with different complexity of parameterization schemes have been developed to estimate et as a result of progress in observation and boundary layer theory see reviews of allen et al 2007 kalma et al 2008 li et al 2009 wang and dickinson 2012 chen and liu 2020 based on models that meet the requirements of being easy to implement globally the

discrepancies have been evident among et datasets as a consequence of different model assumptions calibration approaches parameterization schemes and forcing data khan et al 2018 extensive studies share the overarching objective of scrutinizing the distinctions of different et products in detail the landflux eval project https www iac ethz ch url research landflux eval aims to evaluate and compare currently available et datasets within the dedicated landflux eval initiative jiménez et al 2011 inspected 12 et products reported as latent heat fluxes and found good agreements among the products but with uncertainties up to 50 of the total mean annual et values in a complementary investigation mueller et al 2011 evaluated the annual means and global patterns of 30 datasets and found similarities with respect to global spatial distributions and levels of uncertainty interquartile ranges in most regions furthermore mueller et al 2013 examined et trends or multiannual variations from the landflux eval datasets and showed differences in the multiyear mean despite similar large scale spatial patterns and consistent interannual variations in these datasets to facilitate the common goal of landflux eval the european space agency esa has conducted the water cycle multimission observation strategy for evapotranspiration wacmos et https wacmoset estellus eu to assess available et algorithms and underlying global outcomes on varying temporal spatial scales by using a series of identical forcing wacmos et analyzed and appraised four selected models the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl fisher tu and baldocchi 2008 the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 the penman monteith algorithm from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer evaporation product pm mod mu et al 2011 mu et al 2007 and the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 in the first paper the above four models were run with a set of wacmos et compiled forcing data on daily and subdaily timescales michel et al 2016 in a companion article miralles et al 2016 further compared geographical patterns and seasonality of consequent global scale outputs in other supporting articles mccabe et al 2016 offered insight into the impact of multiscale forcing on model estimation by implementing parallel simulations using two types of input data tower based and global grid based products their results indicated that there is a tendency for grid data driven products to perform worse than tower data driven ones in general wacmos et experiments indicated that gleam and pt jpl might be good models for global application they also verified the finding that no single algorithm maintains the best performance across all biomes and forcing types ground based measurements from the ec instrument have been used as a touchstone to validate et estimations at the site scale ershadi et al 2014 fisher et al 2008 hu et al 2015 xu et al 2019 however validation against in situ measurements does not increase the confidence in the product s performance due to deficiencies of the ec tower and mismatch between the tower footprint and et products li et al 2008 an alternative methodology for large scale evaluation is water balance derived et wbet where et is calculated as a residual of the water budget wbet can be derived from residual precipitation and runoff data under the assumption that total water storage change twsc was negligible at annual and longer timescales miralles et al 2016 velpuri et al 2013 however the regional water balance may be altered by human activities and natural factors such as reservoir operations climate change and surface biology leading to changes in water storage ahmed et al 2014 haddeland et al 2014 mao et al 2016 with the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite in march 2002 https grace jpl nasa gov data get data we can quantify monthly water storage changes over large river basins with high accuracy han et al 2005 swenson et al 2006 swenson et al 2003 wahr et al 2006 wahr et al 2004 previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of considering grace data to drive the realistic estimation of wbet ramillien et al 2005 rodell et al 2004a 2011 zhong et al 2020 this grace combined water balance method is considered a benchmark for validating et over basins for example long longuevergne and scanlon 2014 quantified the uncertainty in lsm or rs based et products using two different sources of grace data and two approaches of grace derived twsc liu et al 2016 reported that et products have a better performance in dry basins than in wet basins zeng et al 2014 analyzed spatiotemporal changes in world et estimation from the perspective of water balance pascolini campbell et al 2020 employed this method to evaluate rs and lsm et products for eleven major river basins in the contiguous united states these studies assessed et products on various scales but it is unclear whether the validation method has any effect on evaluations investigating the variations of results at site and basin scales is essential to the evaluation of high fidelity and ensures that the model or product is accurate in characterization of the et process at various scales as trust in validation methods is requisite to appraise results and thus rate et products in addition numerous previous efforts have investigated the performance of et products but have had a regional focus or limited temporal spans for example velpuri et al 2013 compared two modis et products over conterminous united states from 2001 to 2007 hu et al 2015 compared two et products over europe in 2011 bai and liu 2018 evaluated three global high resolution et products across china during the period 1982 2013 with only eight flux towers these reports might be related to process procedure and the uniqueness of sites and thus undermine fidelity over other areas or across the globe allen et al 2011 haughton et al 2018 few efforts have been made to investigate their performance in specific regions with respect to the varying dominions of climates ecosystems and elevation such evaluation is significant to selecting the proper products and can offer insights into deficiencies in et process modeling in specific regions moreover existing et products may have since improved and new et products have occurred for instance significant progress has been made in the land information system lis framework to run advanced lsms in global land data assimilation systems gldas e g upgrading noah2 8 to noah3 6 the famine early warning systems network fews net land data assimilation system fldas also benefited from the upgraded lis framework and has been applied worldwide other than focusing on africa fluxcom which is a new gridded product using flux tower sites from the fluxnet to train machine learning models for upscaling fluxes jung et al 2019b was not extensively evaluated these advances in et products appeal to an updated product assessment to inform the latest estimated level of global et products the primary objectives of this paper are to 1 compare and evaluate the newest global terrestrial et products against the basin water balance et and fluxnet ec tower and 2 explore the difference in evaluation methods between the site scale and the basin scale these products include data driven one for combined datasets and one for upscaling of ground based observations and process based four for rs approaches and four for lsms estimates see sect 2 1 validation at the site scale and basin scale was used to investigate the performance of both methods and products to our best knowledge there has been no study to explore the difference between the two methods and their influence on the results considering the proliferation in the number of efforts to produce global terrestrial et products comprehensively parallel multiscale assessments with multisource datasets are instructive for the appropriateness of models adapted for global estimation advising the selection of suitable products for global application and understanding the deficiencies of et process modeling at different scales 2 data 2 1 overview of et product datasets in this study we compared and validated 10 global products for comparison purposes we chose products that all have a monthly time resolution although some products may have a shorter or longer temporal resolution a summary of the et products evaluated in this study is listed in table 1 a brief description is provided in the appendix and further details can be found in the reference therein 2 2 validation and auxiliary data 2 2 1 fluxnet 2015 a set of ec data was extracted

2016 the linear interpolation of the adjacent months in the same year was used to fill the gap in grace 3 methods 3 1 validation at the site scale we concentrate on the best available overlapping period of 2003 2013 to ensure that an unbiased comparison is conducted the et products were validated at their original resolution all ec sites for which data were not available during the period of 2003 2013 were excluded which resulted in 197 sites fig 1 shows the location of the ec tower sites used for validation and additional site information is summarized in table a1 these sites are distributed across the extensive biome climate regimes and elevation levels to assess the et products from various perspectives all of the 197 sites were used and stratified according to the following method we categorized these sites into five main climate regimes i e a tropical b arid c temperate d cold e polar according to koppen geiger and three elevation levels i e 500 m 500 2000 m and 2000 m for simplicity biomes from the igbp are grouped into six main land cover types as follows forest comprises evergreen needleleaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf and mixed forest mf grassland is grassland gra cropland includes cropland cro and cropland natural vegetation mosaic cvm wetland is wetland wet shrubland includes open shrublands osh and closed shrublands csh and savanna includes savannas sav and woody savannas wsa for each of the individual towers biomes and elevations are obtained from fluxnet metadata records and five main climate regimes are taken from the koppen geiger climate classification https www gloh2o org koppen last accessed may 21 2022 table 2 lists the number of ec towers in each stratification 3 2 validation at the basin scale we selected eleven large river basins from the major continents worldwide excluding antarctica that cover a wide range of climates with watershed areas exceeding 200 000 km2 considering the direct proportion between the accuracy of grace measurements and the area of the basin wahr et al 2004 fig 2 shows the locations of eleven selected globally distributed river basins drainage basin polygons were collected from the grdc major river basins of the world mrb https www bafg de grdc en 01 grdc grdc node html last accessed may 23 2022 the monthly areal mean et was driven by the water balance equation which can be expressed as follows ramillien et al 2005 2 wbet p r ds dt where p is precipitation r is runoff depth and ds dt is the change in total water storage which is calculated from grace tws the double difference derivative of twsa was then computed to obtain twsc to approximate ds dt as follows long et al 2014 3 ds dt dtwsa dt twsa t 1 t w s a t 1 2 δ t where δt is the temporal sampling of grace twsa i e 1 month and t 1 and t 1 are the preceding and following months respectively for intercomparison all et products were aggregated to 0 5 0 5 grid using an area weighted average to correspond with the grace data the wbet was first calculated at the grid level which means each grid inside the basin has its value finally all grid cells within the watershed for each month were aggregated to obtain a time series on the watershed scale by using latitude cosine as weighting gleisner 2011 resulting in 132 value points for each basin the final step was also used for every et product to obtain its time series i e every et product has 132 value points for each basin 3 3 comparison of validation method validation at the site scale and validation at the basin scale are both used to evaluate et products but few studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of the various validation methods on results in this part we compare those differences to ensure an unbiased comparison we further filtered the basins and ec sites within them based on availability the basins having at least one ec site with a minimum of one year of observation over the period of 2003 2013 and their internal sites were selected yielding a total of 29 ec sites distributed across six basins data not shown 3 4 statistical metrics of evaluations several metrics were employed to comprehensively measure the overall performances of et products against reference et from the ec tower measurements and water balance equation including root mean square error rmse pearson correlation coefficient r mean absolute bias mbe and taylor skill score ts these metrics are expressed as follows mbe 1 n i 1 n et mod i et ref i r i 1 m et mod i et mod i et ref i et ref i i 1 n et mod i et mod i 2 i 1 n et ref i et ref i 2 rmse i 1 n et mod i et ref i 2 n ts 4 1 r σ 1 σ 2 1 r 0 wherenrepresents the sample number e t m o d and e t r e f represent the et product and reference et respectively while et mod l and et ref l are the means of et respectively subscript i denotes the i th sample moreover r0 is the maximum theoreticalr equal to 1 in this study and σ indicates the standard deviation of et estimates normalized by the standard deviation of reference et in general the higher the ts and r are and the closer to zero the mbe and rmse the better the et product performs 4 results 4 1 validation at the site scale with flux tower observations 4 1 1 overall performance fig 3 shows the overall performance for each product compared to all available sites in the statistical measures i e mbe rmse r and ts the corresponding scatterplots indicate that monthly et estimates of all products are reasonable to reproduce estimations of et and capture the seasonality well with metrics ranging from 8 9 mm mon to 6 7 mm mon for mbe 21 9 mm mon to 33 mm mon for rmse 0 65 to 0 85 for r and 0 86 to 0 91 for ts for comparison at the site scale one long outstanding issue that should be considered is that the inaccuracy of estimation can be attributed to a mismatch between pixel grid and the footprints and error from energy closure techniques the disparity between the best fitted linear regression line dashed line and the 1 1 line solid line illustrates a tendency that all et products underestimate in lower et ranges whereas they overestimate in higher et ranges as expected fluxcom achieved the best performance with the highest values in r and ts and the lowest value in rmse since the overlapping ec sites from fluxnet were used to train the ml algorithms a suboptimal result following fluxcom is presented by synthesiset which is reconstructed by the best parts from the different products see sec 2 1 fldas and gldas which share a common model with different forcing data have similar scores except for mbe where the former is 20 fold higher than the latter 6 71 mm mon compared to 0 34 mm mon the difference between gldas and the fldas is ascribed to the input data particularly the precipitation data agutu et al 2020 these two noah model products are also the only ones that generally overestimate the et value gleam generally agrees well with gldas although they are two different models driving with different forcing data gldas and gleam have the same r value r 0 77 while gldas is slightly higher than gleam in terms of mbe and ts mbe of 0 34 mm mon to 1 26 mm mon and ts of 0 88 to 0 86 for gldas compared to gleam and the opposite is seen for rmse 28 08 mm mon to 26 29 mm mon terraclimate shows poor skill compared to other products which is acceptable considering it s an extremely simple algorithm we note that no significant difference is shown in r values and ts for all products other than the relatively lower r of the terraclimate product the four rs products mod16 ntsg pt jplsm and ssebop perform comparably to the lsm products among the individual rs products pt jplsm has a good overall performance with rmse 25 5 mm mon r 0 82 and ts 0 89 despite the largest mbe value i e 8 93 mm mon the poor mbe is a result that pt jplsm uses soil moisture to improve the overestimation at lower et values without adjusting the underestimation of higher et values that are usually found in areas with little moisture limitation ntsg following the pt jplsm shows a more favorable performance than mod16 and implies an advantage of the influence of variable wind speed and atmospheric co2 concentrations in canopy conductance for the retrieval of realistic canopy transpiration the results from the mod16 and ssebop products indicate reasonable agreement with the ec sites which is consistent with the results reported by velpuri et al 2013 both mod16 and ntsg underestimate the et compared to other products ntsg performs slightly better than mod16 which could be the more realistic parameterization of the conductance term in the pm equation based on ndvi used in ntsg rather than lai used in mod16 yebra et al 2013 the use of global modeling and assimilation office gmao meteorological measurements with coarse resolution and misclassification of land cover types was identified as the contributor to the error in mod16 ruhoff et al 2013 the negative higher mbe from ssebop can be partially attributed to the bias in the absolute magnitude of reference et up to 20 senay et al 2013 as well as extraterrestrial solar radiation chen et al 2016 liu et al 2011 while the negative mbe in mod16 could be due to the underlying algorithm michel et al 2016 the substantially different performance between ssebop and synthesiset suggests a weak finding that the pml product could be a good product despite the pml not being directly evaluated against the ec tower gleam and pt jplsm which use the pt equation as the core algorithm to estimate pet and thereby reduce to aet outperform the products that use p m as the core algorithm including mod16 ntsg gldas and fldas these situations might be related to the effective use of biological and environmental constraints in the pt jpl model instead of the p m model ershadi et al 2014 note that these results need to be treated with caution with respect to the skill of products because they represent different spatial resolutions 4 1 2 validation over biomes fig 4 presents the results against the flux data grouped by biomes in the taylor diagrams taylor diagrams provide a statistical summary in terms of correlation root mean square difference and standard deviation which are typically employed to concisely present and visually compare the performance of different products in a specific category taylor 2001 however caution must be applied as the findings might be nonpersuasive for particular classes at which the number of ec sites is limited for the evaluation of biomes unsurprisingly almost all products vary with land cover type generally all products showed high correlation mostly r 0 8 over savanna and grassland and most rmse values are below or slightly exceeding 30 mm mon most products have the lowest rmse 25 mm mon for shrublands while they have moderate performance with r in the range of 0 6 0 85 and rmse between 20 and 35 mm mon over forest over wetlands and cropland these products perform relatively poorly and show large differences between products with r ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 and rmse in the range of 25 45 mm mon the relatively poor results for wetlands may be because these products do not take water evaporation into account the poor results for cropland regions are likely due to the low temporal resolution of the land cover used in some products which does not account for the large seasonal local perturbations such as land use and irrigation for example gleam uses the global vegetation continuous fields product mod44b as a fraction of land cover types but mod44b is offered annually that might not take the phenology of cropland into account despite using the vod to implicitly present the effect of phenological constraints on evaporation martens et al 2017 additionally un differentiated finer vegetation classes which mean land cover classified as cropland as opposed to more specific agrotypes e g corn and soybean may also cause this poor result mccabe and wood 2006 the reduced surface soil moisture retrieval accuracy from space in densely forested and agricultural regions might induce potential issues for products coupled with soil moisture purdy et al 2018 which might contribute to the relatively poor result of gleam over forest and cropland compared to other biomes furthermore neither noah model based products nor mod16 which are strongly tied to greenness and or precipitation represent the hydrological characteristics of irrigated agricultural areas or regions affected by shallow water tables well yilmaz et al 2014 this reason might explain the poor performance of such products over croplands and wetlands with the exception of fldas and terraclimate et products show a stable performance in all vegetation dominated regions i e wetland excluded indicating the robustness of the corresponding algorithms for global applications considering that fldas and gldas share the same algorithm we attribute the poor performance of fldas to the bias introduced by the forcing data and its downscaling mcnally et al 2017 stettz et al 2019 fluxcom similar to the previous overall results had the best performance synthesiset also had relatively good performance over most biomes except for its poor performance on shrubs and moderate performance on grassland this finding indicated that neither ssebop nor pml performed well over the two land covers during the study period gldas and fldas have low r and high rmse 40 mm mon on cropland the lsm products generally have better performance than the rs products in grassland and shrubland while the opposite was true for the remaining biomes gleam was found to have lower rmse and higher r than gldas over all vegetation types which was also found in a recent report by muhammad sarfraz khan et al 2018 they attribute this result to more detailed parameterization and the use of microwave and soil moisture data in gleam khan et al 2018 the relatively poor performance of the mod16 dataset in the forest ecosystem specifically could be attributed to its algorithm which was originally designed for short canopies based on the penman monteith equation terraclimate performed relatively poorly even in wetlands interestingly ssebop performed well over wetland and cropland compared to other biomes these findings must be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to subbiomes for example xu et al 2019 discovered that et products differ from dbf and enf evergreen needleleaf forests which are merged into the forest group in our study 4 1 3 validation for elevation levels given the influence of altitude on factors affecting evaporation such as radiation temperature wind and atmospheric pressure it is advantageous to know how different products behave at different altitudes mcvicar et al 2007 fig 5 exhibits the validation results over three elevation levels these results indicate that elevation influences the accuracy of the et dataset most products have better skills at the medium level than at the low level except for the products ssebop and ntsg which have worse skills at the medium level than at the low level the general best results were obtained at medium altitude levels 500 2000 m with r 0 7 rmse 30 mm mon and std 40 mon despite the minor difference among products at the low elevation level all products show moderate performance with r ranging from 0 6 to 0 85 and rmse between 20 and 40 mm mon while the discrepancy among products at high elevation level has been evident with r ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 rmse ranging from 15 mm mon to 40 mm mon and std ranging from 15 mm mon to 50 mm mon for individual products fluxcom generally shows the best results synthesiset fails to perform second best at high and medium levels compared to other products overall rs products outmatch the lsm products at low levels and the opposite is true at higher levels gleam and pt jpl have similar scores and outperform the p m based product mod16 flads terraclimate and ssebop are of low accuracy at high altitudes where the other products perform well a decrease in the rmse of ssebop and mod16 at the medium level was also reported by velpuri et al 2013 for the poor performance at high levels one of the reasons why ssebop and mod16 underperformed at high elevation levels is because of the errors in the lst satellite data xu et al 2019 terraclimate has a consistent but poor performance at all altitudes the greatest differences between fldas and gldas occur at high altitudes as they do between pt jplsm and gleam and between mod16 and ntsg the low r and high rmse of ssebop at high levels might be attributed to the differential lapse rate which results in an overestimation of et senay 2018 mod16 and fldas are not able to reproduce et at high altitudes by comparing the number of sites of different vegetation types in each elevation level data not shown a similar pattern was found for sites at low elevations to that of the forest dominated regions in the vegetation type which may indicate that the results largely reflect that the unexpected performance of the products at lower elevations may be dominated by the poor performance of et products over forest compared to the low level the lack of crop dominated sites and the few two wetland type sites at the medium level which happen to be areas of poor product performance may explain the overall better product performance at the medium level we speculate that the role of elevation in evapotranspiration is dominant or at least partial enough to be indirectly reflected by the influence of vegetation goulden et al 2012 williams et al 2012 the lack of representation of the sublimation process may be related to the poor performance of some products at high levels another caution that needs to be taken into account is that the result at high levels might be problematic due to very limited measurements as well as the systematic bias from the ec site in complex mountainous terrain hindering the observational data from the ground truth baldocchi 2003 yi et al 2008 in short et products show different trends with altitude altitude does have an effect on et but there is no convincing evidence to put forward that altitude is a decisive factor for determining et and the model appears to be more critical more research which includes more fluxnet sites at extensive altitudes is required to investigate the influence of elevations on et and draw explicit conclusions that may vary markedly over a finer spatial resolution 4 1 4 validation for climate regimes the validation results over the five main climate regimes are displayed in fig 6 overall most of the products except for terraclimate and ssebop perform well in the cold and polar regions where r is 0 8 and rmse is 30 mm mon the rs products and the lsm products exhibit a mixed trend in these regions given the low number of ec towers in the polar regions only 10 towers it may be less representative of the accuracy of the products the sparse ec sites also explain the suboptimal results of fluxcom in the polar regions a large variation was shown across products in temperate region with r ranging from approximately 0 45 to 0 8 0 45 for terraclimate and 0 8 for fluxcom and rmse ranging from 20 mm mon to 40 mm mon which were presented by fluxcom and terraclimate for the lowest and highest rmse respectively the overall manifestations of all lsm products in the tropical climate are better than the temperate zone results except for terraclimate which has the worse result in temperate region interestingly the r of the rs products is slightly higher than that of the lsm products in the temperate climate while the opposite is true in the tropics indicating different abilities of the two types of products to reproduce et in the temperate and tropical zones the rs products performed poorly compared to the lsm products especially the mod16 and ntsg products which have the worst results in arid regions within all climate regimes the different products show substantial metric deviations in arid regions the extremely low r r 0 1 and high rmse approximately 35 mm mon of the ntsg indicate its shortcomings in estimating et in arid regions which is most likely caused by the lack of water balance constraint and subsequent lagged response to the moisture deficit sörensson and ruscica 2018 as evidenced by the better performance of the products that considered soil moisture or used precipitation as input in arid regions including gldas fldas gleam and pt jplsm mu et al 2007 illustrated the underestimation of water stress in dry regions where water is strictly limited by using vapor pressure deficit vpd alone as an indicator mod16 suffers from poor performance for the same reason ssebop may be affected by high variations in land surface temperature at lower latitudes tropical climate in arid regions the accuracy of lst tends to be lower due to the error prone emissivity and albedo values chen et al 2016 terraclimate suffers from little water in arid regions and thus has poor performance a less pronounced difference is shown between gldas and fldas in temperate and tropical regions where larger magnitudes of climatic variables are typically captured reflecting the slightly higher accuracy of the input dataset used to reproduce the global climatic patterns in gldas compared to that used by fldas in addition the ability of the fluxcom product to characterize et is decreased step by step in the order of cold polar temperate arid and tropical climates suggesting that temperature likely contributes to its prediction capacity if we exclude extreme environments i e polar and arid climates synthesiset has the best performance metrics in arid and tropical climates where other products perform poorly the high albedo and high emissivity over snow or ice areas can introduce a substantial bias in lst and the resulting et of ssebop in polar region gleam and pt jplsm which are both based on the p t equation by using different parameterization schemes have good performances in all climate regimes indicating the reliability and advantages of the pt base algorithm 4 2 validation at the basin scale with water balance driven et fig 7 shows the statistical metrics of all products over eleven river basins the multi basin averaged performances across the products are similar with the mbe ranging from 4 8 mm mon to 11 mm mon rmse varying from 21 mm mon to 26 mm mon r between 0 8 and 0 86 and ts in a range of 0 88 0 93 overall the result illustrates that all et products chosen in our study reasonably estimate the wbet in the basin at the monthly timescale all products show the closest agreement with wbet in nontropical basins versus a relatively poor performance in tropical basins especially in wet basins we confirm that consistency across products was found for a given watershed in terms of rmse r and ts while obvious discrepancies were found for mbe larger deviations tend to occur in tropical wet basins which illustrates the complexity and difficulty of estimating et in tropical regions in addition our analysis revealed that the grace missing data has little or no impact on our results data not shown for the mbe in a given basin no consensus with regard to whether overestimating or underestimating et at the basin scale is reached even in gldas and fldas which is also controversial in terms of results as we find the adverse mbe value between gldas and fldas in the mekong river indus river and yangtze river basins changes in input data have an effect on variation not only in amplitude but also in tendency therefore it is difficult to conclude that a particular algorithm has a specific tendency in a basin over all basins gleam and ntsg produce higher values than pt jplsm and mod16 respectively which is found at the site scale evaluation neither the perspective of individual products in all basins nor a single basin in all products shows a consistent tendency in terms of estimations however we deem that the multi basin mean value may reflect the estimated level of the product especially for products fldas pt jplsm and fluxcom since they only show the opposite sign on a certain basin considering that it may be related to the choice of basins and that the absolute multi basin mean value is somewhat balanced by the converse signal value among basins more basins need to be studied to make definitive conclusions in terms of rmse r and ts all products have a clear pattern and consistent estimates for a given basin especially for those products based on a similar core algorithm mod16 and ntsg use the p m algorithm gldas and fldas use the noah model and gleam and pt jplsm use the pt algorithm these products tend to have the same performance additionally mod16 and ntsg have higher rmse and lower r and ts in the murray darling basin which reflect their misestimation for this river their errors in arid regions are also reflected in the site scale assessment fig 4 gldas and fldas show slightly better performance than other products the results of these products that based on similar algorithms show that different parameterization schemes make little fundamental difference at least at the basin scale fluxcom which was the best product in the site scale evaluation has relatively poor results in the basin scale evaluation conversely it is surprising that et products with poor performance at the site scale has better performance at the basin scale especially the terraclimate product which has the lowest bias and good performance ssebop has a low bias and does not substantially differ from other products in terms of other evaluation criteria fldas shows a high meb but has consistent metrics with other products 4 3 characteristics of et seasonal trends in basins to recognize when and how much et was generated for a given timeframe of the year and further illustrate the performance of the products for the basins we plotted the seasonal patterns of all products for the various basins as shown in fig 8 almost all products show consistency over all basins however some et products are incapable of reproducing wbet well over tropical basins particularly wetter basins including the amazon conge mekong indus and niger river basins over the amazon a large divergence and even inverse seasonality between the et products and wbet on the shape of the seasonal cycle is observed which emphasizes the inadequately characterized amazon hydrological cycle we will analyze this problem and possible reasons in the next section for other tropical basins where et products and wbet have a consensus on seasonal patterns but lack agreement on magnitude the difference is proportional to the range of magnitude large variations are generally found in the peak season at which a comparatively minor difference will lead to a large absolute change in value due to the large range of et in addition most et products especially ntsg and ssebop have little match with wbet over the murry darling basin and they sharply fluctuate compared with the other products which are assumed to the misestimation of arid areas within the basin the over or undervaluation profiles are found among et products and they are usually distributed on both sides of the wbet fluxcom and lsm products have tendency to overestimate et over basins while rs products tend to underestimate the spread among the products in the seasonal cycle exemplifies that the integration of information from different sources is favorable note that the occurrence of a sudden increase or decrease in wbet in some months might be attributed to the effects of water management which is not explicitly accounted for in runoff data 4 4 validation at both the basin and the site scales table 3 lists the comparison of results against the basins and the ec site therein the et products at the site scale show a significant difference in performance with the mbe ranging from 16 05 mm mon to 3 28 mm mon rmse varying from 23 64 mm mon to 38 82 mm mon r between 0 59 and 0 87 and ts in a range of 0 72 0 92 the results at the basin scale over the corresponding six basins indicated that these products have agreement on the performances with the mbe ranging from 2 73 mm mon to 10 2 mm mon rmse varying from 21 58 mm mon to 24 65 mm mon r between 0 82 and 0 87 and ts in a range of 0 85 0 94 in terms of mbe pt jplsm and mod16 have better metrics at the site scale compared to those at the basin scale while other products either maintain their metrics or worse some products might show a opposite tendency to estimate et at the different scales for example ntsg overestimates et mbe 4 04 mm mon at the site scale but underestimates et at the basin scale mbe 6 57 mm mon these results indicated that the conclusion to evaluate the estimation tendency of et products at any single scale might be unreliable moreover the mbe of gldas increases from the site scale to the basin scale while the mbe of pt jplsm decreases which indicates that there is no clear pattern of the mbe change between the two scales and it varies with the et products for the rmse r and ts at different scales most et products show enhanced at the basin scale compared to results at the site scale except for the fluxcom which has similar or worse results from the site scale to the basin scale despite the enhancements of most products in terms of rmse r and ts at the basin scale their improved magnitude is different therefore the ranking of et products according to the metrics will change for instance according to ts the best product at the site scale would be synthesiset while gldas will take over that badge at the basin scale in short a discrepancy varying with the product is found between the results validated at the site scale and those validated at the basin scale and this discrepancy is varying with product 5 discussion 5 1 analysis of the amazon basin as shown in fig 8 the et products and wbet exhibit a large discrepancy in annual cycles in the amazon et products show a trough in the winter dry season in contrast wbet depicted a peak the causes for the inadequately characterized amazon et cycle and the opposite seasonality patterns in the dry season are multiple first net radiation was thestrongest driver of et in the tropics fisher et al 2009 hutyra et al 2007 increased evapotranspiration theoretically arises from reduced cloud cover related to little precipitation and high solar radiation during the dry season bonal et al 2016 water limitation is constrained or absent in intact or most amazon forests giardina et al 2018 hutyra et al 2007 root water dynamics including the deep root system hydraulic redistribution and dynamic root functioning are considered to supply water to the forest and thus continue transpiring in the dry season jipp et al 1998 kim et al 2012 on the other hand leaf phenology i e new leaf emergence and litterfall maintaining the canopy green up for access to light has been proposed as a plausible reason to explain greater et in the dry season restrepo coupe et al 2013 wu et al 2016 the models of most products inadequately represent phenology the peak during the dry season may also be facilitated by the regulation of leaf stomata that connect photosynthesis to et these aforementioned mechanisms and their complex interactions are overlooked in all products and lead to an underestimation of et products in the amazon during the dry season for those products that use the vegetation index to represent terrestrial dynamics and retrieve et the saturation of vi over dense canopies and its insufficiency to capture photosynthetic dynamics might explain the trough of corresponding et products including mod16 ntsg pt jplsm and fluxcom wu et al 2016 yan et al 2016 in addition complicated vertical canopy profiles and high species diversity call into question the suitability of current process model predictions for the amazon tropical forest fisher et al 2009 scarce rainfall in the dry season will impose excessive water stress on gleam moreover biases in reanalysis forcing such as radiation clearlyinfluence model performance and determine the deviations in et products gomis cebolla et al 2019 the averaged aggregation of sub basins within the amazon basin also affects the results in fact simulations and local scale observations in previous studies demonstrated that seasonal et varies with regions and the zonal ability of et products to capture the variation baker et al 2021 da rocha et al 2009 sörensson and ruscica 2018 for example decreased vi and consequently reduced et have been found in pasture and savanna areas in the dry season brando et al 2010 huete et al 2006 myneni et al 2007 the heterogeneity of vegetation and nonsynchronous regional patterns for the whole basin might lead to the reflection of weak seasonal cycles in et products the differences in validation results listed in table 3 compared to the watershed and its internal sites also illustrate the impact of different scales for describing product performance therefore it is worth noting that our results and analysis might only be suitable for the whole amazon basin subbasins or specific regions might have different patterns as the location is significant to interpret any et cycle for such a large basin werth and avissar 2004 5 2 difference in evaluation methods and suggestions to future evaluation validation at the site scale and the basin scale shows consistent results obtained by the two methods compared to the ec site the results using the basin water balance method show an improvement in evaluation metrics which might be attributed to the offset of positive and negative biases within the region with the exception of fluxcom and terraclimate the results of other physical process based and integrated products including complex surface model products and rs products are in good agreement the interrelationships between products are also reflected in the two validation methods although there are slight differences in the metrics anomalies in some cases were observed for both methods for example misestimation of dry areas by mod16 and ntsg were found the overestimation relationship among mod16 ntsg gleam and pt jplsm is reflected in the results of both validation methods however we also found that products that perform best on the site scale may perform relatively worse on the watershed scale and vice versa typical examples are fluxcom and terraclimate fluxcom upscaled from the observation site has the best performance compared to the ec tower but reduced performance compared to the water balance approach in contrast the performance of terraclimate which estimated et using the simple water balance approach shows substantial enhancement from site scale evaluation to basin scale evaluation the difference in performance between these two products at both scales suggests that the similar relationship between the estimation and validation methods also affects the assessment results in general the validation results of et products at the basin scale are better than those validation at the site scale the particular relationship between the product models and the validation method for certain products may determine their performance on different scales the differences in results between validation at the site scale and validation at the basin scale vary by product making it impossible to deduce et product performance at the basin scale from the result at the site scale and vice versa therefore a combination of both methods for validation can better assess product performance both at the site scale and at the watershed scale 5 3 instruction for products application the proliferation of et products improves our understanding of et but presents difficulties in the selection for application our extensive evaluation can provide advice on product applicability gldas pt jplsm synthesiset and fluxcom have similar performances and outperform other products synthesiset has outstanding performance but it is not produced in near real time fluxcom has distinct performance at the site scale but its poor performance largest mbe and rmse at the basin scale questions its suitability at a large or even global scale pt jplsm has almost the same performance as gldas at the basin scale and better metrics in terms of rmse r and ts at the site scale its largest mbe approximately 26 times by gldas makes it fail the competition with gldas but a potential competitor to best products thus our results of the evaluation at both the site and basin scales combined with the availability of products suggest that gldas is the best product for global application in addition gleam with good performance at both scales has a four decade time span and are produced in near real time allowing us to steadily track et changes over decades for local or regional applications products with finer spatial resolution play an important role these products are terraclimate mod16 ntsg ssebop fluxcom and synthesiset synthesiset without doubt is the best product if applied in its time span ntsg following the synthesiset shows a relatively good performance in the period of 1982 2013 terracliamte has the worst performance at the site scale for the products that are produced in near real time i e mod16 and ssebop mod16 has a better performance compared to seebop however mod16 fails to estimate the et in specific regions see sect 4 1 for the performance of mod16 in different regions such as regions dominated by arid climates and the murry darling basin while ssebop shows a stable performance across the globe in addition caution should be exercised with respect to the application of fluxcom and terraclimate as the similarity of their underlying methods and validation methods weakens the reliability of their results in summary we recommend synthesiset for most applications for applications where the duration of products is particularly required gldas may be more suitable to estimate the magnitude of global et and gleam to analyze the temporal change while mod16 is more suitable for regional applications if not in those areas where it is defective otherwise ssebop is recommended 5 4 potential improvement to et models and products advances in observational techniques and insights and collaborations across disciplines allow us to better understand the mechanisms of the et process and to some extent characterize new perceptions by improving the representation of fundamental processes and optimizing parameters müller et al 2014 demonstrated that a better representation of land cover data that couples with land surface biophysical properties enhances the model performance to a more realistic et in comparison with the use of fixed land cover types adding a photosynthesis based transpiration scheme into the noah model improves the capacity to simulate et kumar et al 2011 shan et al 2019 integrated a solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif signal into the stomatal conductance model to improve the modeling of regional et promising performance with coupled water and carbon assimilation to estimate transpiration was reported by y zhang et al 2019b wang et al 2021 wang and liang 2008 proposed using a diurnal surface temperature range to minimize sensitivity to temperature and account for the influence of soil moisture sm model calibration will affect the outcome xu et al 2019 kun zhang et al 2019a argued that the mod16 model with optimized parameters has a more reliable et estimation by recalibrating the intrinsic parameters through a more comprehensive bioclimatic site multi model or product integration shows potential paradigms to improve terrestrial et estimation elnashar et al 2021 mccabe et al 2016 models with multi parameterization options can enhance the reproducibility of surface fluxes in the noah model niu et al 2011 ershadi et al 2014 also confirmed that the ensemble mean of the models has good overall performance yin et al 2021 utilized gaussian process regression to combine five process based et models and acquire higher accuracy and reliable performance more accurate input data including site data used to extrapolate to large scale et and meteorological and reanalysis data to drive process based models will be helpful to improve product performance 6 conclusion developing robust global products is a difficult task in this study we evaluated and compared 10 state of the art et products including 4 rs products ssebop mod16 ntsg and pt jplsm 4 lsm products gldas fldas terraclimate and gleam 1 ml upscaling of ec sites fluxcom and 1 integrated product synthesiset both against ec site data from the fluxnet2015 dataset and basin et derived from a water balance approach combined with grace data for the period of 2003 to 2013 at both the site scale and basin scale at the site scale evaluation practices were conducted for different classes grouped by land cover elevation and climate zone the metrics of et products range from 8 9 mm mon to 6 7 mm mon for mbe 21 9 mm mon to 33 mm mon for rmse 0 65 to 0 85 for r and 0 86 to 0 91 for ts overall the results show that no single product performs best in all classes et products have a disperse performance in wetland and cropland at high elevation in tropical and arid climate zones fluxcom tended to have the best performance synthesiset following fluxcom shows a second best performance the complex process based model products with the exception of the fldas products which have relatively poor results outperform the simple water balance and simplified surface energy balance model products i e terraclimate and ssebop expanded observation networks are essential to increase our confidence in assessment and to better understand the et process at the basin scale good agreement in overall performance was found across products even though large differences were observed in particular basins the metrics of et products range from 4 8 mm mon to 11 mm mon for mbe 21 mm mon to 26 mm mon for rmse 0 8 to 0 86 for r and 0 89 to 0 93 for ts most products generally reproduced basin et well but the results were relatively poor in tropical basins especially in the amazon basin where none of the products captured the variability and seasonal trends in et well gldas shows the best performance synthesiset which is an ensemble product maintains the superior performance caution should be taken with fluxcom in large scale applications due to the largest mbe and rmse values over basins ssebop and fldas still have relatively poor results the remaining products including gleam pt jplsm ntsg mod16 and terraclimate lie between the above products more research is needed due to the lack of direct observations at large scales such as basins when comparing the two validation methods the results of products are better at the basin scale than at the site scale whereas the performance of fluxcom is consistent or slightly decreased terraclimate has the largest improvement in metrics the results of both validation methods indicate that the current products perform relatively poorly in arid and tropical regions the particular relationship between the products and the validation methods affects the credibility of their assessment results anomalies of behavior at specific regions and trends between different products are observed at both evaluation scales the differences in results between validation at the site scale and at the basin scale will vary with product the absence and uncertainty of the observation data hampers assessments we extend previous studies to analyze and compare the current status and differences among existing products over extensive area for the long term comprehensive evaluation and comparisons should be valuable for the selection of product applications modeling improvement and comparison of validation methods

2403,evapotranspiration et is a key variable in terrestrial water energy and carbon cycles et products have proliferated this study evaluates ten monthly globally available products including one product from the upscaling of in situ observations fluxcom one ensemble product synthesiset four remote sensing based products ssebop mod16 numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg and pt jplsm and four products from land surface models global land data assimilation system gldas fldas terraclimate and global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam the assessments are conducted during the period of 2003 2013 using fluxnet2015 eddy covariance datasets at the site scale which are grouped by land cover elevation and climate and grace based water balance et at basin scales the results indicate that all products show comparable performance and that no single product shows the best performance fluxcom and gldas have outstanding performances at both the site and basin scales respectively synthesiset tends to have suboptimal performance at both validation scales while fldas ssebop and terraclimate show relatively poor results other products reproduced et moderately well the metrics of the two validation methods are compared the results indicated that the performance of products at the basin scale is usually better than that at the site scale the anomalies in specific regions and the trends among et products are observed at both scales in addition the special relationship between the products and the validation methods will affect the credibility of their assessment results this study contributes to the assessment of the performance of products to identify proper candidates for hydrological analysis and improve the et algorithm keywords evapotranspiration products remote sensing based land surface model eddy covariance water balance data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a critical component of the hydrological cycle and plays a key role in the redistribution of global energy and water accurate estimation of et enables the quantification of surface water and energy budgets prediction of extreme events e g floods and droughts and diagnosis of climate change fisher et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 in situ measurement techniques such as lysimeters eddy covariance ec large aperture scintillometers las and the bowen ratio method provide credible observations to monitor et at site and local scales fisher et al 2011 however the relatively high cost and small spatial fetch of these instruments limit their temporal and spatial coverages compared to meteorological variables and pose a challenge to the representativeness of these site scale observations for large scale heterogeneous land surfaces especially for data sparse regions allen et al 2011 jiménez et al 2011 owing to the limitations of in situ measurement and a desire for creating a more universal approach a variety of models based on diverse mechanisms with different complexity of parameterization schemes have been developed to estimate et as a result of progress in observation and boundary layer theory see reviews of allen et al 2007 kalma et al 2008 li et al 2009 wang and dickinson 2012 chen and liu 2020 based on models that meet the requirements of being easy to implement globally the traditional instrumental limitation has been complemented by several freely available gridded datasets these large scale et datasets can be divided into four categories empirical upscaling of ground based observations remote sensing rs based land surface model lsm andreanalysis datasets in addition a combined dataset using these four categories of datasets forms the fifth category however large discrepancies have been evident among et datasets as a consequence of different model assumptions calibration approaches parameterization schemes and forcing data khan et al 2018 extensive studies share the overarching objective of scrutinizing the distinctions of different et products in detail the landflux eval project https www iac ethz ch url research landflux eval aims to evaluate and compare currently available et datasets within the dedicated landflux eval initiative jiménez et al 2011 inspected 12 et products reported as latent heat fluxes and found good agreements among the products but with uncertainties up to 50 of the total mean annual et values in a complementary investigation mueller et al 2011 evaluated the annual means and global patterns of 30 datasets and found similarities with respect to global spatial distributions and levels of uncertainty interquartile ranges in most regions furthermore mueller et al 2013 examined et trends or multiannual variations from the landflux eval datasets and showed differences in the multiyear mean despite similar large scale spatial patterns and consistent interannual variations in these datasets to facilitate the common goal of landflux eval the european space agency esa has conducted the water cycle multimission observation strategy for evapotranspiration wacmos et https wacmoset estellus eu to assess available et algorithms and underlying global outcomes on varying temporal spatial scales by using a series of identical forcing wacmos et analyzed and appraised four selected models the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl fisher tu and baldocchi 2008 the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 the penman monteith algorithm from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer evaporation product pm mod mu et al 2011 mu et al 2007 and the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 in the first paper the above four models were run with a set of wacmos et compiled forcing data on daily and subdaily timescales michel et al 2016 in a companion article miralles et al 2016 further compared geographical patterns and seasonality of consequent global scale outputs in other supporting articles mccabe et al 2016 offered insight into the impact of multiscale forcing on model estimation by implementing parallel simulations using two types of input data tower based and global grid based products their results indicated that there is a tendency for grid data driven products to perform worse than tower data driven ones in general wacmos et experiments indicated that gleam and pt jpl might be good models for global application they also verified the finding that no single algorithm maintains the best performance across all biomes and forcing types ground based measurements from the ec instrument have been used as a touchstone to validate et estimations at the site scale ershadi et al 2014 fisher et al 2008 hu et al 2015 xu et al 2019 however validation against in situ measurements does not increase the confidence in the product s performance due to deficiencies of the ec tower and mismatch between the tower footprint and et products li et al 2008 an alternative methodology for large scale evaluation is water balance derived et wbet where et is calculated as a residual of the water budget wbet can be derived from residual precipitation and runoff data under the assumption that total water storage change twsc was negligible at annual and longer timescales miralles et al 2016 velpuri et al 2013 however the regional water balance may be altered by human activities and natural factors such as reservoir operations climate change and surface biology leading to changes in water storage ahmed et al 2014 haddeland et al 2014 mao et al 2016 with the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite in march 2002 https grace jpl nasa gov data get data we can quantify monthly water storage changes over large river basins with high accuracy han et al 2005 swenson et al 2006 swenson et al 2003 wahr et al 2006 wahr et al 2004 previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of considering grace data to drive the realistic estimation of wbet ramillien et al 2005 rodell et al 2004a 2011 zhong et al 2020 this grace combined water balance method is considered a benchmark for validating et over basins for example long longuevergne and scanlon 2014 quantified the uncertainty in lsm or rs based et products using two different sources of grace data and two approaches of grace derived twsc liu et al 2016 reported that et products have a better performance in dry basins than in wet basins zeng et al 2014 analyzed spatiotemporal changes in world et estimation from the perspective of water balance pascolini campbell et al 2020 employed this method to evaluate rs and lsm et products for eleven major river basins in the contiguous united states these studies assessed et products on various scales but it is unclear whether the validation method has any effect on evaluations investigating the variations of results at site and basin scales is essential to the evaluation of high fidelity and ensures that the model or product is accurate in characterization of the et process at various scales as trust in validation methods is requisite to appraise results and thus rate et products in addition numerous previous efforts have investigated the performance of et products but have had a regional focus or limited temporal spans for example velpuri et al 2013 compared two modis et products over conterminous united states from 2001 to 2007 hu et al 2015 compared two et products over europe in 2011 bai and liu 2018 evaluated three global high resolution et products across china during the period 1982 2013 with only eight flux towers these reports might be related to process procedure and the uniqueness of sites and thus undermine fidelity over other areas or across the globe allen et al 2011 haughton et al 2018 few efforts have been made to investigate their performance in specific regions with respect to the varying dominions of climates ecosystems and elevation such evaluation is significant to selecting the proper products and can offer insights into deficiencies in et process modeling in specific regions moreover existing et products may have since improved and new et products have occurred for instance significant progress has been made in the land information system lis framework to run advanced lsms in global land data assimilation systems gldas e g upgrading noah2 8 to noah3 6 the famine early warning systems network fews net land data assimilation system fldas also benefited from the upgraded lis framework and has been applied worldwide other than focusing on africa fluxcom which is a new gridded product using flux tower sites from the fluxnet to train machine learning models for upscaling fluxes jung et al 2019b was not extensively evaluated these advances in et products appeal to an updated product assessment to inform the latest estimated level of global et products the primary objectives of this paper are to 1 compare and evaluate the newest global terrestrial et products against the basin water balance et and fluxnet ec tower and 2 explore the difference in evaluation methods between the site scale and the basin scale these products include data driven one for combined datasets and one for upscaling of ground based observations and process based four for rs approaches and four for lsms estimates see sect 2 1 validation at the site scale and basin scale was used to investigate the performance of both methods and products to our best knowledge there has been no study to explore the difference between the two methods and their influence on the results considering the proliferation in the number of efforts to produce global terrestrial et products comprehensively parallel multiscale assessments with multisource datasets are instructive for the appropriateness of models adapted for global estimation advising the selection of suitable products for global application and understanding the deficiencies of et process modeling at different scales 2 data 2 1 overview of et product datasets in this study we compared and validated 10 global products for comparison purposes we chose products that all have a monthly time resolution although some products may have a shorter or longer temporal resolution a summary of the et products evaluated in this study is listed in

period of 2003 2013 to ensure that an unbiased comparison is conducted the et products were validated at their original resolution all ec sites for which data were not available during the period of 2003 2013 were excluded which resulted in 197 sites fig 1 shows the location of the ec tower sites used for validation and additional site information is summarized in table a1 these sites are distributed across the extensive biome climate regimes and elevation levels to assess the et products from various perspectives all of the 197 sites were used and stratified according to the following

scale we selected eleven large river basins from the major continents worldwide excluding antarctica that cover a wide range of climates with watershed areas exceeding 200 000 km2 considering the direct proportion between the accuracy of grace measurements and the area of the basin wahr et al 2004 fig 2 shows the locations of eleven selected globally distributed river basins drainage basin polygons were collected from the grdc major river basins of the world mrb https www bafg de grdc en 01 grdc grdc node html last accessed may 23 2022 the monthly areal mean et was driven by the water balance equation which can be expressed as follows ramillien et al 2005 2 wbet p r ds dt where p is precipitation r is runoff depth and ds dt is the change in total water storage which is calculated from grace tws the double difference derivative of twsa was then computed to obtain twsc to approximate ds dt as follows long et al 2014 3 ds dt dtwsa dt twsa t 1 t w s a t 1 2 δ t where δt is the temporal sampling of grace twsa i e 1 month and t 1 and t 1 are the preceding and following months respectively for intercomparison all et products were aggregated to 0 5 0 5 grid using an area weighted average to correspond with the grace data the wbet was first calculated at the grid level which means each grid inside the basin has its value finally all grid cells within the watershed for each month were aggregated to obtain a time series on the watershed scale by using latitude cosine as weighting gleisner 2011 resulting in 132 value points for each basin the final step was also used for every et product to obtain its time series i e every et product has 132 value points for each basin 3 3 comparison of validation method validation at the site scale and validation at the basin scale are both used to evaluate et products but few studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of the various validation methods on results in this part we compare those differences to ensure an unbiased comparison we further filtered the basins and ec sites within them based on availability the basins having at least one ec site with a minimum of one year of observation over the period of 2003 2013 and their internal sites were selected yielding a total of 29 ec sites distributed across six basins data not shown 3 4 statistical metrics of evaluations several metrics were employed to comprehensively measure the overall performances of et products against reference et from the ec tower measurements and water balance equation including root mean square error rmse pearson correlation coefficient r mean absolute bias mbe and taylor skill score ts these metrics are expressed as follows mbe 1 n i 1 n et mod i et ref i r i 1 m et mod i et mod i et ref i et ref i i 1 n et mod i et mod i 2 i 1 n et ref i et ref i 2 rmse i 1 n et mod i et ref i 2 n ts 4 1 r σ 1 σ 2 1 r 0 wherenrepresents the sample number e t m o d and e t r e f represent the et product and reference et respectively while et mod l and et ref l are the means of et respectively subscript i denotes the i th sample moreover r0 is the maximum theoreticalr equal to 1 in this study and σ indicates the standard deviation of et estimates normalized by the standard deviation of reference et in general the higher the ts and r are and the closer to zero the mbe and rmse the better the et product performs 4 results 4 1 validation at the site scale with flux tower observations 4 1 1 overall performance fig 3 shows the overall performance for each product compared to all available sites in the statistical measures i e mbe rmse r and ts the corresponding scatterplots indicate that monthly et estimates of all products are reasonable to reproduce estimations of et and capture the seasonality well with metrics ranging from 8 9 mm mon to 6 7 mm mon for mbe 21 9 mm mon to 33 mm mon for rmse 0 65 to 0 85 for r and 0 86 to 0 91 for ts for comparison at the site scale one long outstanding issue that should be considered is that the inaccuracy of estimation can be attributed to a mismatch between pixel grid and the footprints and error from energy closure techniques the disparity between the best fitted linear regression line dashed line and the 1 1 line solid line illustrates a tendency that all et products underestimate in lower et ranges whereas they overestimate in higher et ranges as expected fluxcom achieved the best performance with the highest values in r and ts and the lowest value in rmse since the overlapping ec sites from fluxnet were used to train the ml algorithms a suboptimal result following fluxcom is presented by synthesiset which is reconstructed by the best parts from the different products see sec 2 1 fldas and gldas which share a common model with different forcing data have similar scores except for mbe where the former is 20 fold higher than the latter 6 71 mm mon compared to 0 34 mm mon the difference between gldas and the fldas is ascribed to the input data particularly the precipitation data agutu et al 2020 these two noah model products are also the only ones that generally overestimate the et value gleam generally agrees well with gldas although they are two different models driving with different forcing data gldas and gleam have the same r value r 0 77 while gldas is slightly higher than gleam in terms of mbe and ts mbe of 0 34 mm mon to 1 26 mm mon and ts of 0 88 to 0 86 for gldas compared to gleam and the opposite is seen for rmse 28 08 mm mon to 26 29 mm mon terraclimate shows poor skill compared to other products which is acceptable considering it s an extremely simple algorithm we note that no significant difference is shown in r values and ts for all products other than the relatively lower r of the terraclimate product the four rs products mod16 ntsg pt jplsm and ssebop perform comparably to the lsm products among the individual rs products pt jplsm has a good overall performance with rmse 25 5 mm mon r 0 82 and ts 0 89 despite the largest mbe value i e 8 93 mm mon the poor mbe is a result that pt jplsm uses soil moisture to improve the overestimation at lower et values without adjusting the underestimation of higher et values that are usually found in areas with little moisture limitation ntsg following the pt jplsm shows a more favorable performance than mod16 and implies an advantage of the influence of variable wind speed and atmospheric co2 concentrations in canopy conductance for the retrieval of realistic canopy transpiration the results from the mod16 and ssebop products indicate reasonable agreement with the ec sites which is consistent with the results reported by velpuri et al 2013 both mod16 and ntsg underestimate the et compared to other products ntsg performs slightly better than mod16 which could be the more realistic parameterization of the conductance term in the pm equation based on ndvi used in ntsg rather than lai used in mod16 yebra et al 2013 the use of global modeling and assimilation office gmao meteorological measurements with coarse resolution and misclassification of land cover types was identified as the contributor to the error in mod16 ruhoff et al 2013 the negative higher mbe from ssebop can be partially attributed to the bias in the absolute magnitude of reference et up to 20 senay et al 2013 as well as extraterrestrial solar radiation chen et al 2016 liu et al 2011 while the negative mbe in mod16 could be due to the underlying algorithm michel et al 2016 the substantially different performance between ssebop and synthesiset suggests a weak finding that the pml product could be a good product despite the pml not being directly evaluated against the ec tower gleam and pt jplsm which use the pt equation as the core algorithm to estimate pet and thereby reduce to aet outperform the products that use p m as the core algorithm including mod16 ntsg gldas and fldas these situations might be related to the effective use of biological and environmental constraints in the pt jpl model instead of the p m model ershadi et al 2014 note that these results need to be treated with caution with respect to the skill of products because they represent different spatial resolutions 4 1 2 validation over biomes fig 4 presents the results against the flux data grouped by biomes in the taylor diagrams taylor diagrams provide a statistical summary in terms of correlation root mean square difference and standard deviation which are typically employed to concisely present and visually compare the performance of different products in a specific category taylor 2001 however caution must be applied as the findings might be nonpersuasive for particular classes at which the number of ec sites is limited for the evaluation of biomes unsurprisingly almost all products vary with land cover type generally all products showed high correlation mostly r 0 8 over savanna and grassland and most rmse values are below or slightly exceeding 30 mm mon most products have the lowest rmse 25 mm mon for shrublands while they have moderate performance with r in the range of 0 6 0 85 and rmse between 20 and 35 mm mon over forest over wetlands and cropland these products perform relatively poorly and show large differences between products with r ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 and rmse in the range of 25 45 mm mon the relatively poor results for wetlands may be because these products do not take water evaporation into account the poor results for cropland regions are likely due to the low temporal resolution of the land cover used in some products which does not account for the large seasonal local perturbations such as land use and irrigation for example gleam uses the global vegetation continuous fields product mod44b as a fraction of land cover types but mod44b is offered annually that might not take the phenology of cropland into account despite using the vod to implicitly present the effect of phenological constraints on evaporation martens et al 2017 additionally un differentiated finer vegetation classes which mean land cover classified as cropland as opposed to more specific agrotypes e g corn and soybean may also cause this poor result mccabe and wood 2006 the reduced surface soil moisture retrieval accuracy from space in densely forested and agricultural regions might induce potential issues for products coupled with soil moisture purdy et al 2018 which might contribute to the relatively poor result of gleam over forest and cropland compared to other biomes furthermore neither noah model based products nor mod16 which are strongly tied to greenness and or precipitation represent the hydrological characteristics of irrigated agricultural areas or regions affected by shallow water tables well yilmaz et al 2014 this reason might explain the poor performance of such products over croplands and wetlands with the exception of fldas and terraclimate et products show a stable performance in all vegetation dominated regions i e wetland excluded indicating the robustness of the corresponding algorithms for global applications considering that fldas and gldas share the same algorithm we attribute the poor performance of fldas to the bias introduced by the forcing data and its downscaling mcnally et al 2017 stettz et al 2019 fluxcom similar to the previous overall results had the best performance synthesiset also had relatively good performance over most biomes except for its poor performance on shrubs and moderate performance on grassland this finding indicated that neither ssebop nor pml performed well over the two land covers during the study period gldas and fldas have low r and high rmse 40 mm mon on cropland the lsm products generally have better performance than the rs products in grassland and shrubland while the opposite was true for the remaining biomes gleam was found to have lower rmse and higher r than gldas over all vegetation types which was also found in a recent report by muhammad sarfraz khan et al 2018 they attribute this result to more detailed parameterization and the use of microwave and soil moisture data in gleam khan et al 2018 the relatively poor performance of the mod16 dataset in the forest ecosystem specifically could be attributed to its algorithm which was originally designed for short canopies based on the penman monteith equation terraclimate performed relatively poorly even in wetlands interestingly ssebop performed well over wetland and cropland compared to other biomes these findings must be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to subbiomes for example xu et al 2019 discovered that et products differ from dbf and enf evergreen needleleaf forests which are merged into the forest group in our study 4 1 3 validation for elevation levels given the influence of altitude on factors affecting evaporation such as radiation temperature wind and atmospheric pressure it is advantageous to know how different products behave at different altitudes mcvicar et al 2007 fig 5 exhibits the validation results over three elevation levels these results indicate that elevation influences the accuracy of the et dataset most products have better skills at the medium level than at the low level except for the products ssebop and ntsg which have worse skills at the medium level than at the low level the general best results were obtained at medium altitude levels 500 2000 m with r 0 7 rmse 30 mm mon and std 40 mon despite the minor difference among products at the low elevation level all products show moderate performance with r ranging from 0 6 to 0 85 and rmse between 20 and 40 mm mon while the discrepancy among products at high elevation level has been evident with r ranging from 0 5 to 0 9 rmse ranging from 15 mm mon to 40 mm mon and std ranging from 15 mm mon to 50 mm mon for individual products fluxcom generally shows the best results synthesiset fails to perform second best at high and medium levels compared to other products overall rs products outmatch the lsm products at low levels and the opposite is true at higher levels gleam and pt jpl have similar scores and outperform the p m based product mod16 flads terraclimate and ssebop are of low accuracy at high altitudes where the other products perform well a decrease in the rmse of ssebop and mod16 at the medium level was also reported by velpuri et al 2013 for the poor performance at high levels one of the reasons why ssebop and mod16 underperformed at high elevation levels is because of the errors in the lst satellite data xu et al 2019 terraclimate has a consistent but poor performance at all altitudes the greatest differences between fldas and gldas occur at high altitudes as they do between pt jplsm and gleam and between mod16 and ntsg the low r and high rmse of ssebop at high levels might be attributed to the differential lapse rate which results in an overestimation of et senay 2018 mod16 and fldas are not able to reproduce et at high altitudes by comparing the number of sites of different vegetation types in each elevation level data not shown a similar pattern was found for sites at low elevations to that of the forest dominated regions in the vegetation type which may indicate that the results largely reflect that the unexpected performance of the products at lower elevations may be dominated by the poor performance of et products over forest compared to the low level the lack of crop dominated sites and the few two wetland type sites at the medium level which happen to be areas of poor product performance may explain the overall better product performance at the medium level we speculate that the role of elevation in evapotranspiration is dominant or at least partial enough to be indirectly reflected by the influence of vegetation goulden et al 2012 williams et al 2012 the lack of representation of the sublimation process may be related to the poor performance of some products at high levels another caution that needs to be taken into account is that the result at high levels might be problematic due to very limited measurements as well as the systematic bias from the ec site in complex mountainous terrain hindering the observational data from the ground truth baldocchi 2003 yi et al 2008 in short et products show different trends with altitude altitude does have an effect on et but there is no convincing evidence to put forward that altitude is a decisive factor for determining et and the model appears to be more critical more research which includes more fluxnet sites at extensive altitudes is required to investigate the influence of elevations on et and draw explicit conclusions that may vary markedly over a finer spatial resolution 4 1 4 validation for climate regimes the validation results over the five main climate regimes are displayed in fig 6 overall most of the products except for terraclimate and ssebop perform well in the cold and polar regions where r is 0 8 and rmse is 30 mm mon the rs products and the lsm products exhibit a mixed trend in these regions given the low number of ec towers in the polar regions only 10 towers it may be less representative of the accuracy of the products the sparse ec sites also explain the suboptimal results of fluxcom in the polar regions a large variation was shown across products in temperate region with r ranging from approximately 0 45 to 0 8 0 45 for terraclimate and 0 8 for fluxcom and rmse ranging from 20 mm mon to 40 mm mon which were presented by fluxcom and terraclimate for the lowest and highest rmse respectively the overall manifestations of all lsm products in the tropical climate are better than the temperate zone results except for terraclimate which has the worse result in temperate region interestingly the r of the rs products is slightly higher than that of the lsm products in the temperate climate while the opposite is true in the tropics indicating different abilities of the two types of products to reproduce et in the temperate and tropical zones the rs products performed poorly compared to the lsm products especially the mod16 and ntsg products which have the worst results in arid regions within all climate regimes the different products show substantial metric deviations in arid regions the extremely low r r 0 1 and high rmse approximately 35 mm mon of the ntsg indicate its shortcomings in estimating et in arid regions which is most likely caused by the lack of water balance constraint and subsequent lagged response to the moisture deficit sörensson and ruscica 2018 as evidenced by the better performance of the products that considered soil moisture or used precipitation as input in arid regions including gldas fldas gleam and pt jplsm mu et al 2007 illustrated the underestimation of water stress in dry regions where water is strictly limited by using vapor pressure deficit vpd alone as an indicator mod16 suffers from poor performance for the same reason ssebop may be affected by high variations in land surface temperature at lower latitudes tropical climate in arid regions the accuracy of lst tends to be lower due to the error prone emissivity and albedo values chen et al 2016 terraclimate suffers from little water in arid regions and thus has poor performance a less pronounced difference is shown between gldas and fldas in temperate and tropical regions where larger magnitudes of climatic variables are typically captured reflecting the slightly higher accuracy of the input dataset used to reproduce the global climatic patterns in gldas compared to that used by fldas in addition the ability of the fluxcom product to characterize et is decreased step by step in the order of cold polar temperate arid and tropical climates suggesting that temperature likely contributes to its prediction capacity if we exclude extreme environments i e polar and arid climates synthesiset has the best performance metrics in arid and tropical climates where other products perform poorly the high albedo and high emissivity over snow or ice areas can introduce a substantial bias in lst and the resulting et of ssebop in polar region gleam and pt jplsm which are both based on the p t equation by using different parameterization schemes have good performances in all climate regimes indicating the reliability and advantages of the pt base algorithm 4 2 validation at the basin scale with water balance driven et fig 7 shows the statistical metrics of all products over eleven river basins the multi basin averaged performances across the products are similar with the mbe ranging from 4 8 mm mon to 11 mm mon rmse varying from 21 mm mon to 26 mm mon r between 0 8 and 0 86 and ts in a range of 0 88 0 93 overall the result illustrates that all et products chosen in our study reasonably estimate the wbet in the basin at the monthly timescale all products show the closest agreement with wbet in nontropical basins versus a relatively poor performance in tropical basins especially in wet basins we confirm that consistency across products was found for a given watershed in terms of rmse r and ts while obvious discrepancies were found for mbe larger deviations tend to occur in tropical wet basins which illustrates the complexity and difficulty of estimating et in tropical regions in addition our analysis revealed that the grace missing data has little or no impact on our results data not shown for the mbe in a given basin no consensus with regard to whether overestimating or underestimating et at the basin scale is reached even in gldas and fldas which is also controversial in terms of results as we find the adverse mbe value between gldas and fldas in the mekong river indus river and yangtze river basins changes in input data have an effect on variation not only in amplitude but also in tendency therefore it is difficult to conclude that a particular algorithm has a specific tendency in a basin over all basins gleam and ntsg produce higher values than pt jplsm and mod16 respectively which is found at the site scale evaluation neither the perspective of individual products in all basins nor a single basin in all products shows a consistent tendency in terms of estimations however we deem that the multi basin mean value may reflect the estimated level of the product especially for products fldas pt jplsm and fluxcom since they only show the opposite sign on a certain basin considering that it may be related to the choice of basins and that the absolute multi basin mean value is somewhat balanced by the converse signal value among basins more basins need to be studied to make definitive conclusions in terms of rmse r and ts all products have a clear pattern and consistent estimates for a given basin especially for those products based on a similar core algorithm mod16 and ntsg use the p m algorithm gldas and fldas use the noah model and gleam and pt jplsm use the pt algorithm these products tend to have the same performance additionally mod16 and ntsg have higher rmse and lower r and ts in the murray darling basin which reflect their misestimation for this river their errors in arid regions are also reflected in the site scale assessment fig 4 gldas and fldas show slightly better performance than other products the results of these products that based on similar algorithms show that different parameterization schemes make little fundamental difference at least at the basin scale fluxcom which was the best product in the site scale evaluation has relatively poor results in the basin scale evaluation conversely it is surprising that et products with poor performance at the site scale has better performance at the basin scale especially the terraclimate product which has the lowest bias and good performance ssebop has a low bias and does not substantially differ from other products in terms of other evaluation criteria fldas shows a high meb but has consistent metrics with other products 4 3 characteristics of et seasonal trends in basins to recognize when and how much et was generated for a given timeframe of the year and further illustrate the performance of the products for the basins we plotted the seasonal patterns of all products for the various basins as shown in fig 8 almost all products show consistency over all basins however some et products are incapable of reproducing wbet well over tropical basins particularly wetter basins including the amazon conge mekong indus and niger river basins over the amazon a large divergence and even inverse seasonality between the et products and wbet on the shape of the seasonal cycle is observed which emphasizes the inadequately characterized amazon hydrological cycle we will analyze this problem and possible reasons in the next section for other tropical basins where et products and wbet have a consensus on seasonal patterns but lack agreement on magnitude the difference is proportional to the range of magnitude large variations are generally found in the peak season at which a comparatively minor difference will lead to a large absolute change in value due to the large range of et in addition most et products especially ntsg and ssebop have little match with wbet over the murry darling basin and they sharply fluctuate compared with the other products which are assumed to the misestimation of arid areas within the basin the over or undervaluation profiles are found among et products and they are usually distributed on both sides of the wbet fluxcom and lsm products have tendency to overestimate et over basins while rs products tend to underestimate the spread among the products in the seasonal cycle exemplifies that the integration of information from different sources is favorable note that the occurrence of a sudden increase or decrease in wbet in some months might be attributed to the effects of water management which is not explicitly accounted for in runoff data 4 4 validation at both the basin and the site scales table 3 lists the comparison of results against the basins and the ec site therein the et products at the site scale show a significant difference in performance with the mbe ranging from 16 05 mm mon to 3 28 mm mon rmse varying from 23 64 mm mon to 38 82 mm mon r between 0 59 and 0 87 and ts in a range of 0 72 0 92 the results at the basin scale over the corresponding six basins indicated that these products have agreement on the performances with the mbe ranging from 2 73 mm mon to 10 2 mm mon rmse varying from 21 58 mm mon to 24 65 mm mon r between 0 82 and 0 87 and ts in a range of 0 85 0 94 in terms of mbe pt jplsm and mod16 have better metrics at the site scale compared to those at the basin scale while other products either maintain their metrics or worse some products might show a opposite tendency to estimate et at the different scales for example ntsg overestimates et mbe 4 04 mm mon at the site scale but underestimates et at the basin scale mbe 6 57 mm mon these results indicated that the conclusion to evaluate the estimation tendency of et products at any single scale might be unreliable moreover the mbe of gldas increases from the site scale to the basin scale while the mbe of pt jplsm decreases which indicates that there is no clear pattern of the mbe change between the two scales and it varies with the et products for the rmse r and ts at different scales most et products show enhanced at the basin scale compared to results at the site scale except for the fluxcom which has similar or worse results from the site scale to the basin scale despite the enhancements of most products in terms of rmse r and ts at the basin scale their improved magnitude is different therefore the ranking of et products according to the metrics will change for instance according to ts the best product at the site scale would be synthesiset while gldas will take over that badge at the basin scale in short a discrepancy varying with the product is found between the results validated at the site scale and those validated at the basin scale and this discrepancy is varying with product 5 discussion 5 1 analysis of the amazon basin as shown in fig 8 the et products and wbet exhibit a large discrepancy in annual cycles in the amazon et products show a trough in the winter dry season in contrast wbet depicted a peak the causes for the inadequately characterized amazon et cycle and the opposite seasonality patterns in the dry season are multiple first net radiation was thestrongest driver of et in the tropics fisher et al 2009 hutyra et al 2007 increased evapotranspiration theoretically arises from reduced cloud cover related to little precipitation and high solar radiation during the dry season bonal et al 2016 water limitation is constrained or absent in intact or most amazon forests giardina et al 2018 hutyra et al 2007 root water dynamics including the deep root system hydraulic redistribution and dynamic root functioning are considered to supply water to the forest and thus continue transpiring in the dry season jipp et al 1998 kim et al 2012 on the other hand leaf phenology i e new leaf emergence and litterfall maintaining the canopy green up for access to light has been proposed as a plausible reason to explain greater et in the dry season restrepo coupe et al 2013 wu et al 2016 the models of most products inadequately represent phenology the peak during the dry season may also be facilitated by the regulation of leaf stomata that connect photosynthesis to et these aforementioned mechanisms and their complex interactions are overlooked in all products and lead to an underestimation of et products in the amazon during the dry season for those products that use the vegetation index to represent terrestrial dynamics and retrieve et the saturation of vi over dense canopies and its insufficiency to capture photosynthetic dynamics might explain the trough of corresponding et products including mod16 ntsg pt jplsm and fluxcom wu et al 2016 yan et al 2016 in addition complicated vertical canopy profiles and high species diversity call into question the suitability of current process model predictions for the amazon tropical forest fisher et al 2009 scarce rainfall in the dry season will impose excessive water stress on gleam moreover biases in reanalysis forcing such as radiation clearlyinfluence model performance and determine the deviations in et products gomis cebolla et al 2019 the averaged aggregation of sub basins within the amazon basin also affects the results in fact simulations and local scale observations in previous studies demonstrated that seasonal et varies with regions and the zonal ability of et products to capture the variation baker et al 2021 da rocha et al 2009 sörensson and ruscica 2018 for example decreased vi and consequently reduced et have been found in pasture and savanna areas in the dry season brando et al 2010 huete et al 2006 myneni et al 2007 the heterogeneity of vegetation and nonsynchronous regional patterns for the whole basin might lead to the reflection of weak seasonal cycles in et products the differences in validation results listed in table 3 compared to the watershed and its internal sites also illustrate the impact of different scales for describing product performance therefore it is worth noting that our results and analysis might only be suitable for the whole amazon basin subbasins or specific regions might have different patterns as the location is significant to interpret any et cycle for such a large basin werth and avissar 2004 5 2 difference in evaluation methods and suggestions to future evaluation validation at the site scale and the basin scale shows consistent results obtained by the two methods compared to the ec site the results using the basin water balance method show an improvement in evaluation metrics which might be attributed to the offset of positive and negative biases within the region with the exception of fluxcom and terraclimate the results of other physical process based and integrated products including complex surface model products and rs products are in good agreement the interrelationships between products are also reflected in the two validation methods although there are slight differences in the metrics anomalies in some cases were observed for both methods for example misestimation of dry areas by mod16 and ntsg were found the overestimation relationship among mod16 ntsg gleam and pt jplsm is reflected in the results of both validation methods however we also found that products that perform best on the site scale may perform relatively worse on the watershed scale and vice versa typical examples are fluxcom and terraclimate fluxcom upscaled from the observation site has the best performance compared to the ec tower but reduced performance compared to the water balance approach in contrast the performance of terraclimate which estimated et using the simple water balance approach shows substantial enhancement from site scale evaluation to basin scale evaluation the difference in performance between these two products at both scales suggests that the similar relationship between the estimation and validation methods also affects the assessment results in general the validation results of et products at the basin scale are better than those validation at the site scale the particular relationship between the product models and the validation method for certain products may determine their performance on different scales the differences in results between validation at the site scale and validation at the basin scale vary by product making it impossible to deduce et product performance at the basin scale from the result at the site scale and vice versa therefore a combination of both methods for validation can better assess product performance both at the site scale and at the watershed scale 5 3 instruction for products application the proliferation of et products improves our understanding of et but presents difficulties in the selection for application our extensive evaluation can provide advice on product applicability gldas pt jplsm synthesiset and fluxcom have similar performances and outperform other products synthesiset has outstanding performance but it is not produced in near real time fluxcom has distinct performance at the site scale but its poor performance largest mbe and rmse at the basin scale questions its suitability at a large or even global scale pt jplsm has almost the same performance as gldas at the basin scale and better metrics in terms of rmse r and ts at the site scale its largest mbe approximately 26 times by gldas makes it fail the competition with gldas but a potential competitor to best products thus our results of the evaluation at both the site and basin scales combined with the availability of products suggest that gldas is the best product for global application in addition gleam with good performance at both scales has a four decade time span and are produced in near real time allowing us to steadily track et changes over decades for local or regional applications products with finer spatial resolution play an important role these products are terraclimate mod16 ntsg ssebop fluxcom and synthesiset synthesiset without doubt is the best product if applied in its time span ntsg following the synthesiset shows a relatively good performance in the period of 1982 2013 terracliamte has the worst performance at the site scale for the products that are produced in near real time i e mod16 and ssebop mod16 has a better performance compared to seebop however mod16 fails to estimate the et in specific regions see sect 4 1 for the performance of mod16 in different regions such as regions dominated by arid climates and the murry darling basin while ssebop shows a stable performance across the globe in addition caution should be exercised with respect to the application of fluxcom and terraclimate as the similarity of their underlying methods and validation methods weakens the reliability of their results in summary we recommend synthesiset for most applications for applications where the duration of products is particularly required gldas may be more suitable to estimate the magnitude of global et and gleam to analyze the temporal change while mod16 is more suitable for regional applications if not in those areas where it is defective otherwise ssebop is recommended 5 4 potential improvement to et models and products advances in observational techniques and insights and collaborations across disciplines allow us to better understand the mechanisms of the et process and to some extent characterize new perceptions by improving the representation of fundamental processes and optimizing parameters müller et al 2014 demonstrated that a better representation of land cover data that couples with land surface biophysical properties enhances the model performance to a more realistic et in comparison with the use of fixed land cover types adding a photosynthesis based transpiration scheme into the noah model improves the capacity to simulate et kumar et al 2011 shan et al 2019 integrated a solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif signal into the stomatal conductance model to improve the modeling of regional et promising performance with coupled water and carbon assimilation to estimate transpiration was reported by y zhang et al 2019b wang et al 2021 wang and liang 2008 proposed using a diurnal surface temperature range to minimize sensitivity to temperature and account for the influence of soil moisture sm model calibration will affect the outcome xu et al 2019 kun zhang et al 2019a argued that the mod16 model with optimized parameters has a more reliable et estimation by recalibrating the intrinsic parameters through a more comprehensive bioclimatic site multi model or product integration shows potential paradigms to improve terrestrial et estimation elnashar et al 2021 mccabe et al 2016 models with multi parameterization options can enhance the reproducibility of surface fluxes in the noah model niu et al 2011 ershadi et al 2014 also confirmed that the ensemble mean of the models has good overall performance yin et al 2021 utilized gaussian process regression to combine five process based et models and acquire higher accuracy and reliable performance more accurate input data including site data used to extrapolate to large scale et and meteorological and reanalysis data to drive process based models will be helpful to improve product performance 6

water balance approach combined with grace data for the period of 2003 to 2013 at both the site scale and basin scale at the site scale evaluation practices were conducted for different classes

basin et well but the results were relatively poor in tropical basins especially in the amazon basin where none of the products captured the variability and seasonal trends in et well gldas shows the best performance synthesiset which is an ensemble product maintains the superior performance caution should be taken with fluxcom in large scale applications due to the largest mbe and rmse values over basins ssebop and fldas still have relatively poor results the remaining products including gleam pt jplsm ntsg mod16 and terraclimate lie between the above products more research is needed due to the lack of direct observations at large scales such as basins when comparing the two validation methods the results of products are better at the basin scale than at the site scale whereas the performance of fluxcom is consistent or slightly decreased terraclimate has the largest improvement in metrics the results of both validation methods indicate that the current products perform relatively poorly in arid and tropical regions the particular relationship between the products and the validation methods affects the credibility of their assessment results anomalies of behavior at specific regions and trends between different products are observed at both evaluation scales the differences in results between validation at the site scale and at the basin scale will vary with product the absence and uncertainty of the observation data hampers assessments we extend previous studies to analyze and compare the current status and differences among existing products over extensive area for the long term comprehensive evaluation and comparisons should be valuable for the selection of product applications modeling improvement and comparison of validation methods

2404,global warming has led to increase in climate extremes which altered both hydrological cycles and soil erosion processes however the responses of river sediment load to climate change especially climate extremes have not been well understood due to a lack of comprehensive assessment this study investigated the temporal trends and spatial patterns of sediment load at 70 hydrological stations during the period of 1956 2019 in ten major river basins in china both the partial linear square regression model and the double mass curve method were used to quantify the contribution of key climatic indices and anthropogenic driving forces overall the annual total sediment load exhibited a significant negative trend p 0 01 decreasing from 1842 18 mt yr in 1960 s to 322 72 mt yr in 2010 s 82 48 the significant decline of sediment load was particularly obvious in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin the abrupt changes of sediment load mostly occurred in 1985 2000 human activities were primarily response for sediment load changes in most basins the sediment load in mainstream was mainly regulated by reservoirs while the tributaries were largely affected by soil and water conservation measures intensive human activities have led to substantial changes in land surface and resulted in weakened correlation between sediment load and climate extremes generally precipitation erosive rainfall and precipitation amount in flood period were closely related to sediment load in the southwest river basin and northwest river basin the sediment load had a relatively good relationship with extreme temperature which was related to alpine snowmelt and permafrost degradation due to climate warming this study provides good insights for a better understanding of the interaction between river sediment load and climate extremes variables which will be valuable for decision making in river basin management keywords sediment load climate extremes attribution analysis human activities chinese river basins data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the terrestrial environment on the earth has been altered greatly due to climate change ren et al 2002 and increasingly intensive human activities miao et al 2011 global climate warming has resulted in significant changes in regional hydrological cycles whereas intensive human activities altered hydrological pathways by damming and reduced soil erosion and sediment yield through vegetation restoration it has been found that sediment load of approximately 40 large rivers experienced significant changes most notably declining trends in asia s large rivers beechie et al 2010 li et al 2020 changes in sediment load have an important impact on river erosion carbon and nitrogen transport and nutrient migration therefore research on changes in sediment load is of great significance to global environmental protection sustainable development of watershed and carbon neutrality recently many studies have reported that global climate change resulted in significant changes in river sediment load lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 li et al 2021b min et al 2013 wentz et al 2007 arias 2021 and zhou and qian 2021 found evident increase of precipitation extremes showed evident increase with global warming which led to changes in both hydrological and erosion processes generally a few precipitation extreme events can produce a large amount of sediment which probably resulted in vast majority of annual soil loss estrany et al 2010 han et al 2017 indicated that rainstorms played a dominant role in soil loss and was the key factor for sediment yield in many regions of the world climate extreme events such as regionally persistent heavy rainfall have great potential to induce severe floods and extraordinarily high soil erosion lenzi and marchi 2000 li et al 2022b the river runoff and sediment load in mainland china have experienced dramatic changes in recent decades hassan et al 2008 walling 2006 wang et al 2021b yang et al 2022 li et al 2018 found a significant decreasing trend of sediment load in nine major rivers in china during the past six decades annual sediment load decreased from 1 92 gt yr during 1954 1968 to 0 34 gt yr during 2000 2016 the yellow river and yangtze river are the two largest rivers in china and the changing trends of their stream flow and sediment load have extracted considerable attentions recently li et al 2008 in the yellow river basin the sediment load had decreased by approximately 90 over the past 70 years and human activities were the main driving forces omer et al 2020 wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2017a similarly the sediment load in the yangtze river had significant decline and dam construction was the dominant factor 88 climate change was responsible for a slight increase in sediment load approximately 3 dai et al 2008 overall the spatiotemporal changes of sediment load in different chinese rivers have been investigated however most of these studies selected the hydrological gauging stations at the river mouths which can t characterize spatial heterogeneity of sediment yield furthermore the climate extremes have significant contribution to total sediment yield whereas the relationship between sediment load and climate extremes have not been clarified therefore the primary objectives of this study are to 1 assess the temporal and spatial changes of sediment load at 70 hydrological stations as well as the climate extremes during 1956 2019 in the mainland china 2 explore the relationship between sediment load and climate extremes indices the results are expected to provide a good reference for river basin management and hydraulic construction in the major rivers in china 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area china is located in the east of asia on the west shore of the pacific ocean and the climate is strongly influenced by continents and oceans it is characterized of monsoon climate with high spatial heterogeneity of precipitation and temperature from south to north china has numerous rivers making it one of the countries with the most rivers in the world according to topography and river networks the mainland of china was divided into ten river basins fig 1 songhuajiang river basin shrb liaohe river basin lrb haihe river basin hairb huaihe river basin huairb yangtze river basin yzrb yellow river basin yrb pearl river basin prb southeast river basin serb southwest river basin swrb and northwest river basin nwrb additional geographic information for the ten rivers was listed in supplementary table 1 2 2 dataset the annual sediment load data of 70 hydrological stations fig 1 from 1956 to 2019 were obtained from the water resources committee and the river sediment bulletin of china among these 53 stations had 63 years continuous observed data in the period of 1956 to 2019 9 stations had over 40 years data mainly in the lrb hairb and serb and the remaining 8 stations had 30 years continuous observed data mostly in the nwrb and serb a total of 781 climate stations with daily meteorological variables including temperature and precipitation were obtained from the china national climate center http data cma cn all the hydro climatic data have been checked to guarantee their quality and consistency the dams and reservoirs data were obtained from the geo referenced global dam and reservoir database wang et al 2021a the terraces data in 2018 were obtained from cao et al 2021 the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index of the study area at 1998 2008 and 2018 was synthesized data based on spot vegetation proba v 1 km product xu 2018 3 methodologies 3 1 temporal trends and abrupt changes trends in sediment load and climate extremes were analyzed by means of the non parametric mann kendall mk test kendall 1990 mann 1945 and sen s slope sen and kumar 1968 these methods have been frequently used to quantify the significance of trends in hydro meteorological time series douglas et al 2000 partal and kahya 2006 pettitt test method was employed to detect the abrupt changing year of the annual sediment load during the study time series pettitt 1979 yacoub and tayfur 2019 zhao et al 2009 according to the abrupt changing points the entire study period was divided into two stages reference period named period i and changing period named period ii 3 2 climate indices climate extremes were the driving forces of many natural disasters such as floods droughts heat waves leading to severe disaster risk in regions a total of 27 climate extremes indices have been defined by the ipcc to investigate climate extreme changes and their potential risks alexander et al 2006 dulière et al 2011 min et al 2013 sillmann et al 2013 in addition heavy rain r25 rainstorm r50 erosive rainfall daily rainfall 12 mm r12 and erosive rainfall days rd12 were considered as important indices affecting soil erosion and sediment load angulo martínez and beguería 2009 wang et al 2016c in total we selected 15 climate extremes indices table 1 since they were confirmed to strongly influence the sediment load lenzi and marchi 2000 xie et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 among the selected fifteen indices two indices reflect the temperature annual mean temperature tmean and max daily temperature tmax and seven indices are related to precipitation extremes including heavy precipitation amount r25 heavy precipitation days rd25 rainstorm amount r50 rainstorm days rd50 and the maximum precipitation amount in 3 d rx3 5 d rx5 and 7 d rx7 the remaining metrics are annual total wet day precipitation pwet potential evapotranspiration pet rainy days rds erosive rainfall r12 erosive rainfall days rd12 and precipitation amount in flood period fsptot the daily pet was calculated according to the penman monteith equation allen 1998 and then summed to the annual value 3 3 partial least squares regression in this study we used the partial least squares regression plsr to detect the linkages between annual sediment load and climate extremes indices the plsr explores the relationships between an independent set of climate variables x n m arranged in a matrix with n observations and m variables and the dependent vector of annual sediment load y the plsr searches the components of x that best predict y abdi 2010 carrascal et al 2009 the first step of plsr is to decompose the independent and dependent variables expressed as 1 x t p t e x 2 y u w t e y where t and u are the n k scores matrices k is the number of components p and w are the m k weights matrices and e is the residual matrix n m x and y are maintained by 4 u b t where b n n is determined by least squares minimization to further obtain the regression coefficient a key step to obtain a model with an acceptable predictive capability is the selection of the optimal number of plsr components this number was determined by cross validation to achieve an optimal balance between the explained variation in the response r2 and the predictive ability of the model goodness of prediction q2 abdi 2010 onderka et al 2012 another goodness of fit criterion recommended by asce task committee 1993 is nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 calculated with the eq 6 the value of nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 an efficiency of 1 0 corresponds to a perfect match between observed and modelled data whereas a negative value of nse represents unreliable model 5 r 2 t 1 n p i p m o i o m 2 t 1 n p i p m 2 o i o m 2 6 q 2 1 0 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 7 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 where p i and q i are the predicted and observed annual sediment load for the ith year of an n year data series and m is the number of plsr components p i is the predicted sediment load for the leave one out sample the optimal number of plsr components frequently corresponds to a minimal rmse and maximum q cum 2 lopez et al 2008 luedeling and gassner 2012 8 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n then a set of regression coefficients b plsr were calibrated from the optimized plsr model these coefficients were then applied to predict the dependent variable y pred as 9 y pred x b plsr e for the reference period the mean of the predicted sediment load in matrix y pred was equal to the observed sediment load thus a regression equation between climatic variables and sediment load was developed and evaluated the meaning of each component was indicated by the weights w i attained in matrix p t which can be used to quantify the relationship between the predictors and response in different components lopez et al 2008 the importance of the variable was represented by vip the variable importance for the projection which was equal to the sum of the squares of the plsr weights across all components a variable with a score greater than one was considered to be a significant predominant predictor for sediment load luedeling and gassner 2012 3 4 double mass curve the double mass curve dmc has been widely used in hydrologic analysis as it can be easily used to estimate the stage change of hydrological series and quantify the influencing factors through eliminating minor trend effects in the time series deng et al 2021 li et al 2022a restrepo and syvitski 2006 searcy and hardison 1960 walling 2006 the dmc between annual precipitation and sediment load clearly reflects the impacts of human activities the period i represents the reference period when no intensive human activities occurred while the period ii represents the changing period which is associated with significant human activities thus for a given sediment load time series the total change in mean annual sediment load δ s l tot can be calculated as 10 δ s l tot s l 2 obs s l 1 obs where s l 1 obs and s l 2 obs are the mean annual sediment load observed in the period i and period ii respectively the regression equation obtained according to the optimal climate indicator determined by plsr for a given catchment during the period i was used to predict climate driven sediment load in period ii the difference between the predicted mean sediment load in period ii and the observed value for the period i represents the change in mean annual sediment load due to climate variability δ s l c lim 11 δ s l c lim s l 2 c lim s l 1 obs where s l 2 c lim is the mean annual sediment load predicted by climate variables in period ii which assumed that the sediment load has not been influenced by significant human activities therefore the δ s l c lim is the change in sediment load due to climate only similarly the difference between s l 2 c lim and s l 2 obs is the sediment load change resulted from human activities δ s l hum during the period 12 δ s l hum s l 2 obs s l 2 c lim 4 results 4 1 changes of sediment load 4 1 1 temporal trends of sediment load the temporal changing trends of sediment load were detected by mann kendall test and sen s slope test in the past six decades fig 2 the results showed that 54 of the 70 hydrological stations had a significant decreasing trend in sediment load and only 2 stations had an increasing trend the remaining stations showed no significant trend and were mainly concentrated in the nwrb and serb when focusing on the river mouth stations fig 3 annual total sediment load in ten rivers had been decreased from 1842 18 mt yr in the 1960s to 322 72 mt yr in the 2010s with a decrease of 82 48 in the 1960s the yrb yzrb and prb delivered the highest sediment load accounting for 96 22 of the total sediment load in the mainland china however by the 2010s the yrb yzrb and nwrb became the main sediment load basins accounting for 88 64 of the total the sediment load contribution rates of yrb decreased from 65 36 in the 1960s to 39 15 in the 2010s whereas yzrb increased from 26 73 to 37 65 during the same period the sediment load of the yrb reached more than 1 6 billion t yr in the 1960s much higher than those of other river basins but it dropped to about 170 mt yr with the highest reduction rate of the ten river basins by the 2010s in the 1960s the annual sediment load of the yzrb ranged from 400 to 500 mt yr reduced to 100 mt yr in the 2010s the changes in the middle and lower yzrb were responsible for the significant reduction the sediment load of mainstream stations in the prb was 50 60 mt yr in the 1950s and reduced by 80 in the 2010s in the 1960s annual sediment load in the lrb hairb and huairb were all lower than 30 mt yr during 2010s it reduced to 3 mt yr the hairb even decreased to zero the trend of sediment load in other basins was not obvious relatively 4 1 2 abrupt changes in annual sediment load as fig 4 and fig 5 shown the results of the pettitt test indicated that most of the river basins had significant abrupt changing points p 0 01 mainly occurred during 1985 2002 for example the annual sediment load at stations in the yrb had abrupt changes during 1985 2002 especially during 1994 2002 in the upper and middle reaches the changing points of shrb occurred after 1982 and the changing points in the lrb concentrated in 1994 2002 the significant change points in the hairb were concentrated in 1979 1999 however the abrupt changes in the nwrb and swrb were not significant the remaining abrupt changes of sediment load mainly occurred after 2002 concentrated in the nwrb and swrb which may be related to the construction and operation of hydropower facilities especially in the heihe river reservoir construction began in 2001 and seven cascade hydropower stations were built successively the construction of hydropower stations changed the natural hydrological process of the river and affected the change of sediment load 4 2 changes in climate extremes indices fig 6 displayed the changing trends of the selected extreme climatic indices the temporal trends of tmax varied from 0 03 to 0 07 c yr 1 with positive trends in the northern and central china and negative trends in the northwestern and southeastern china tmean showed an increasing trend in the mainland of china the temperature increased gradually from south to north especially in northern china the range of trends for pwet 3 54 3 61 mm yr 1 r12 3 00 3 95 mm yr 1 was similar with positive slopes across the chinese mainland except for a small area had negative slopes negative slopes of r50 1 93 3 58 mm yr 1 were observed in the most of the study region with positive slopes only in the southeast the trends of fsptot ranged from 3 28 to 2 45 mm yr 1 with positive trends in the majority of study area and negative trends in the northeast the rds trends varied from 0 25 to 0 41 d yr 1 with positive slopes observed in the majority of study areas and negative slopes in the central china positive trend of rd12 was observed across the majority of the study area with negative values in the parts of western and eastern in contrast the changing trends of rd25 0 05 0 09 d yr 1 and rd50 0 04 0 04 d yr 1 decreased throughout the study area except for a small area in the southeast it can be observed that temperature and precipitation amounts across the study area increased and climate extremes became relatively more intense the changing trends of these climatic extremes had high spatial heterogeneity resulting in substantial influences on sediment load change 4 3 relationship between sediment load and climate extremes indices 4 3 1 correlation analysis the pearson method was applied to investigate the correlation between sediment load and the selected climate extremes supplementary fig 1 negative correlation coefficients were found between sediment load and the tmean tmax and pet at the majority of hydrological stations whereas positive correlation coefficients of tmean and tmax were observed in the shrb most of the rainfall extreme indices were positively correlated with sediment load in majority of basins for example the correlation coefficients between annual sediment load and pwet were higher than 0 6 in the yrb huairb and serb showing their strong correlation positive correlation was examined between sediment load and fsptot in the huairb and serb compared with period i the correlation between sediment load and extreme climate during the period ii became weaker in most basins especially in yrb and yzrb for instance the correlation between pwet and fsptot and sediment load mostly decreased from about 0 6 to 0 4 in the yrb in other basins there was no significant change in correlation between sediment load and climate extremes while the relationship was enhanced in a few basins such as shrb and huairb 4 3 2 plsr modeling the plsr model was constructed for each catchment in period i to reveal the relationship between annual sediment load and climate extreme variables table 2 summarized the statistical results of the plsr models for the major rivers in period i overall most models cumulatively explained more than 60 of the total variance in the annual sediment load whereas the first component appeared to explain over 40 of the total variance indicating the robustness of the plsr model the results of plsr model were reliable with low values of rmse and high nse according to the correlation coefficients and vip values of climate extremes obtained by plsr we determined the key climate extreme variables that dominantly influenced the annual sediment load changes as shown in fig 7 the horizontal and vertical axes represented the first and second correlation coefficients respectively the circle size denotes the vip value the red circles have the vip 1 0 and the blue circles have the vip 1 0 the variables with scores greater than 1 can be considered as dominant factor influencing sediment load taking yanchi station of hairb as an example r50 was the most significant influencing factor to sediment load according to both correlation coefficient and vip value the dominant factors affecting sediment load for each basin were determined by the plsr method the correlations between sediment load and climate extreme indices showed high spatial patterns in different river basins fig 8 lu et al 2013 in contrast pwet r12 and fsptot were found to be the dominant influencing factors in most river basins pwet played a key role in sediment load changes in the yzrb and yrb the changes of sediment load in the prb were most closely related to r12 and r50 in the nwrb swrb and serb fsptot was observed to be the most important factors influencing sediment load 4 3 3 contribution of sediment load changes the contribution of climate change and human activities to the variations of sediment load was estimated by the dmc between sediment load and selected climate extremes variables fig 9 obviously human activities were found to be the dominant factor to the changes of sediment load in the study basins the contribution rates of human activities ranged from 56 to 99 in the yrb human activities had relatively higher contributions to sediment load changes than those in the other river basins with the contribution of more than 85 at many stations in the yzrb we found that human activities accounted for more than 80 on sediment load changes at 64 stations sediment load changes at only approximately 17 of the stations which were mainly distributed in the shrb nwrb swrb and serb can be dominantly attributed to climate change and the contributions of climate change ranged from 84 to 99 but human activities had a negative effect on sediment load changes at these stations 5 discussion 5 1 changes of sediment load and attributions annual sediment load of the most rivers experienced significantly decreasing trends p 0 01 especially the yzrb and yrb whereas sediment load in the serb nwrb and swrb showed no significant trends and even slightly increase in some stations apparently sediment load showed increase trend in the tibetan rivers due to evident warming li et al 2021a whereas the annual sediment load in nwrb showed consistent trends since the climate was getting wetter tian et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in shrb both climate warming and human activities aggravated soil erosion resulting in a larger sediment load meanwhile a series of ecological restoration projects such as natural forest protection project and returning farmland to forest and grassland had led to significant reduction in sediment load at some stations li et al 2009 sui et al 2018 as for the yrb and yzrb human activities induced significant reduction in annual sediment load wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2017b it can be clearly seen that abrupt changes of annual sediment load were ascribed to the construction of hydraulic engineering works fig 10 and the implementation of water and soil conservation projects generally reservoirs construction was an important factor for sediment load changes in the mainstream stations boix fayos et al 2007 smith et al 2016 for instance the three gorge dam tgd was responsible for the abrupt change in sediment load at datong and yichang stations indicating their substantial trapping effects guo et al 2022 zhao et al 2017b in the yrb several large scale reservoirs built in the 1980s such as bapanxia reservoir longyangxia reservoir and lijiaxia reservoir were the dominate factor for abrupt changes of sediment load at lanzhou and tougaoduai stations in addition zhang et al 2012b and zhang and lu 2009 found that the alteration of sediment load at boluo station was the result of the construction of fengshuba reservoir and xinfengjiang reservoir in the prb for tributaries soil and water conservation measures and small and medium sized water conservancy projects jointly affected the change of sediment load such as terraces fig 11 and vegetation restoration fig 12 table 3 for example significant abrupt changes were detected in 1999 in many tributaries due to the initiation of the grain for green project in the yrb guan et al 2019 miao et al 2011 and more than 58 000 check dams and 5 5 104 km2 terraces have been built and the vegetation coverage has increased from 28 8 in 1980 to 65 in 2020 in the loess plateau leading to approximately 90 reduction of sediment load in the yrb ran et al 2020 wu et al 2020a similarly a total of 11 931 reservoirs have been built up by the end of 1980s with a total storage capacity of 20 5 billion m3 in the yzrb china river sediment bulletin these reservoirs have trapped large amount of sediment from upstream similar results were also found in other basins such as shrb serb and prb where large reservoirs in the mainstream played significant role in sediment trapping and the soil and water conservation measures had great effects on sediment load changes in the tributaries dai et al 2007 guo et al 2012 wu et al 2016 especially in the 1980s intensive human activities such as soil conservation projects irrigation water abstraction mining etc resulted in abrupt changes in sediment load fig 5 zhang et al 2012 a large number of studies have found that intensive human activities were the mainly driving forces to the changes in sediment load wang et al 2016b wu et al 2020b zhao et al 2017a many of them indicated that climate change contributed 20 30 to sediment load changes in the yrb zhao et al 2009 zhao et al 2017a 3 28 in the yzrb dai et al 2008 guo et al 2022 wei and he 2012 and 12 80 in the prb liu et al 2014a liu et al 2014b while the results of our study showed that precipitation changes contributed far 20 in the yrb and yzrb and about 20 in the prb in these basins the rainfall variables had upwards trends and supposed to result in increase of soil erosion and sediment load however such increases might be offset by reservoir trapping and other activities dai et al 2008 in the lrb hairb and huairb precipitation variable showed decreasing trends which led to a downward trend in sediment load this indicated that human activities such as reservoirs construction soil and water conservation vegetation restoration and land use changes could greatly reduce soil erosion and sediment load in the basins buendia et al 2016 latrubesse et al 2009 rengers et al 2016 topping et al 2018 5 2 linkage between sediment load and climate extremes the changes of sediment load were closely related to extreme precipitation such as pwet r12 and fsptot and were weakly related to extreme temperatures it has been confirmed that extreme precipitation was a key factor influencing the changes of sediment load dulière et al 2011 nowbuth 2016 especially in the regions with large scale soil conservation measures pan et al 2013 rengers et al 2016 for example the loess plateau experienced significant changes land surface with large amount of terraces and dams construction and vegetation improvement large storms with high rainfall erosivity contributed great proportion to the total sediment load in the rivers feng et al 2020 teng et al 2019 yin et al 2019 in this study annual sediment load at hejin huayuankou and lijin stations was more closely related to r25 and r50 in yrb similarly good correlation between sediment load and r25 was detected in the karst area of the xijiang river the largest tributary of the prb li et al 2021b extreme rainfall has strong effect on soil erosion processes which in turn affects river sediment load raindrops strike soil surface causing more splash erosion furthermore heavy rainfall can more easily saturates the soil yielding surface water which flushes the surface soil forming rills and gullies thus intense or prolonged rainfall has the most important role in the formation of ephemeral gullies and the generation of muddy floods leading to high sediment load boardman 2015 li et al 2021c rengers et al 2016 wei et al 2007 in the nwrb and swrb sediment load were more closely related to extreme temperature which can be ascribed to the snowmelt in mountains tian et al 2020 similarly zhang et al 2020 found that sediment load changes were more sensitive to temperature in tibet the increase in temperature led to the melting of glaciers and increase of runoff resulted in increased erosive power and transport capacity of the river flow additionally permafrost degradation became potential sediment sources resulting in increase of sediment load due to prolonged unfrozen time and freezing thawing cycles zeng et al 2018 the relationship between sediment load and climate extremes became weaker when comparing the period ii to period i at many stations in the basins particularly in the yrb and yzrb annual sediment load decreased due to various human activities e g soil and water conservation measures optimized the topography and vegetation restoration projects catam et al 2002 ouchi 2015 rmkens et al 2002 in period ii whereas the climate extremes showed no significant changes however sediment load was more closely related to climate extremes in the shrb and huairb according to the changes of ndvi in table 3 the vegetation coverage in these two basins did not increase rapidly many studies suggested that inappropriate human activities disturbed land surface and destroyed forested land which intensified the soil erosion in the basins sui et al 2018 zhong et al 2017 5 3 perspectives for basin management overall annual sediment load showed significant decrease in many river basins p 0 01 particularly in the yrb and yzrb human activities such as dams reservoirs and vegetation restoration contributed more than 80 to sediment changes great reduction of sediment load may result in delta erosion and shoreline retreat which in turn made delta shrink and sea water intrusion and further induced heavy damages in flood mitigation and habitats environment blum and roberts 2009 grams and schmidt 2005 topping et al 2018 the dramatic changes in sediment load may generate additional challenges in river basin management due to delta changes river channel flushing reservoirs deposition and nutrients and organic matters transport through land to ocean gao et al 2018 kong et al 2015 wang et al 2016b among the major rivers only several hydrological stations had increasing trends in annual sediment load mainly distributed in nwrb swrb and shrb climate warming is the dominant driving force inducing glacier melting and permafrost degradation the river sediment in the nwrb and swrb more sensitive to temperature increase tian et al 2020 zeng et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 thus great efforts are needed to reduce carbon emission and promote sustainable climate smart practices to slow climate warming though numerous ecological restoration measures have been implemented in majority of the river basins leading to great reduction in annual sediment load some regions were still suffered from unreasonable reclamation the extreme rainfall events could produce severe floods and considerable soil erosion on the disturbed soil destro et al 2018 gonzalez hidalgo et al 2007 pingping et al 2018 such as areas in shrb in such case sustainable agricultural measures should be undertaken during the farming activities apparently a series of soil and water conservation measures have been undertaken in large areas in china accordingly the vegetation cover has increased 11 and the terraced arable land reached 5 85 105 km2 and about one hundred thousand dams have been built cao et al 2021 song et al 2020 wang et al 2021a these measures resulted in significant reduction in annual sediment load at many stations in the studied rivers it convinced the success of soil and water conservation measures in reducing soil erosion and improvement of ecological environment however extreme events occurred more frequently and led to more severe flood disasters alimohammadlou et al 2014 osterkamp and friedman 2000 pingping et al 2018 this presented great challenges for soil conservation measures to adapt extreme climate events high quality and optimized layout of conservation measures are needed to protect regions suffered from large floods and severe soil loss 6 conclusions this study demonstrated temporal trends and spatial patterns of sediment load variations in chinese major rivers during the past sixty decades meanwhile using plsr and correlation analysis to select crucial factors affecting sediment load changes and quantify the contribution of climate and human activities to sediment load the main conclusions as follows the annual sediment load of most rivers in china 77 1 decreased significantly p 0 01 especially in the yzrb and yrb the sediment load of the nwrb and swrb was detected with no significant change most of the change points of sediment load were concentrated in 1985 2000 showing high spatial and temporal heterogeneities due to various human activities overall temperature and precipitation across the study area increased and extremes became relatively more intense the correlation between sediment load and climate extremes decreased after changing point in the most of study areas the dominant climate variables affecting sediment load were precipitation extremes including pwet annual total wet day precipitation r12 erosive precipitation and fsptot precipitation amount in flood period extreme temperature affected sediment load changes in nwrb and swrb which was related to snowmelt in the mountains and permafrost degradation the changes of sediment load were mostly dominated by human activities with different contribution proportions in different basins the large reservoirs or dams were responsible for sediment load changes in the mainstream whereas climate extremes events and soil conservation projects were responsible for the changes in tributaries changes in extreme precipitation had critical roles in sediment load

2404,global warming has led to increase in climate extremes which altered both hydrological cycles and soil erosion processes however the responses of river sediment load to climate change especially climate extremes have not been well understood due to a lack of comprehensive assessment this study investigated the temporal trends and spatial patterns of sediment load at 70 hydrological stations during the period of 1956 2019 in ten major river basins in china both the partial linear square regression model and the double mass curve method were used to quantify the contribution of key climatic indices and anthropogenic driving forces overall the annual total sediment load exhibited a significant negative trend p 0 01 decreasing from 1842 18 mt yr in 1960 s to 322 72 mt yr in 2010 s 82 48 the significant decline of sediment load was particularly obvious in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin the abrupt changes of sediment load mostly occurred in 1985 2000 human activities were primarily response for sediment load changes in most basins the sediment load in mainstream was mainly regulated by reservoirs while the tributaries were largely affected by soil and water conservation measures intensive human activities have led to substantial changes in land surface and resulted in weakened correlation between sediment load and climate extremes generally precipitation erosive rainfall and precipitation amount in flood period were closely related to sediment load in the southwest river basin and northwest river basin the sediment load had a relatively good relationship with extreme temperature which was related to alpine snowmelt and permafrost degradation due to climate warming this study provides good insights for a better understanding of the interaction between river sediment load and climate extremes variables which will be valuable for decision making in river basin management keywords sediment load climate extremes attribution analysis human activities chinese river basins data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the terrestrial environment on the earth has been altered greatly due to climate change ren et al 2002 and increasingly intensive human activities miao et al 2011 global climate warming has resulted in significant changes in regional hydrological cycles whereas intensive human activities altered hydrological pathways by damming and reduced soil erosion and sediment yield through vegetation restoration it has been found that sediment load of approximately 40 large rivers experienced significant changes most notably declining trends in asia s large rivers beechie et al 2010 li et al 2020 changes in sediment load have an important impact on river erosion carbon and nitrogen transport and nutrient migration therefore research on changes in sediment load is of great significance to global environmental protection sustainable development of watershed and carbon neutrality recently many studies have reported that global climate change resulted in significant changes in river sediment load lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 li et al 2021b min et al 2013 wentz et al 2007 arias 2021 and zhou and qian 2021 found evident increase of precipitation extremes showed evident increase with global warming which led to changes in both hydrological and erosion processes generally a few precipitation extreme events can produce a large amount of sediment which probably resulted in vast majority of annual soil loss estrany et al 2010 han et al 2017 indicated that rainstorms played a dominant role in soil loss and was the key factor for sediment yield in many regions of the world climate extreme events such as regionally persistent heavy rainfall have great potential to induce severe floods and extraordinarily high soil erosion lenzi and marchi 2000 li et al 2022b the river runoff and sediment load in mainland china have experienced dramatic changes in recent decades hassan et al 2008 walling 2006 wang et al 2021b yang et al 2022 li et al 2018 found a significant decreasing trend of sediment load in nine major rivers in china during the past six decades annual sediment load decreased from 1 92 gt yr during 1954 1968 to 0 34 gt yr during 2000 2016 the yellow river and yangtze river are the two largest rivers in china and the changing trends of their stream flow and sediment load have extracted considerable attentions recently li et al 2008 in the yellow river basin the sediment load had decreased by approximately 90 over the past 70 years and human activities were the main driving forces omer et al 2020 wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2017a similarly the sediment load in the yangtze river had significant decline and dam construction was the dominant factor 88 climate change was responsible for a slight increase in sediment load approximately 3 dai et al 2008 overall the spatiotemporal changes of sediment load in different chinese rivers have been investigated however most of these studies selected the hydrological gauging stations at the river mouths which can t characterize spatial heterogeneity of sediment yield furthermore the climate extremes have significant contribution to total sediment yield whereas the relationship between sediment load and climate extremes have not been clarified therefore the primary objectives of this study are to 1 assess the temporal and spatial changes of sediment load at 70 hydrological stations as well as the climate extremes during 1956 2019 in the mainland china 2 explore the relationship between sediment load and climate extremes indices the results are expected to provide a good reference for river basin management and hydraulic construction in the major rivers in china 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area china is located in the east of asia on the west shore of the pacific ocean and the climate is strongly influenced by continents and oceans it is characterized of monsoon climate with high spatial heterogeneity of precipitation and temperature from south to north china has numerous rivers making it one of the countries with the most rivers in the world according to topography and river networks the mainland of china was divided into ten river basins fig 1 songhuajiang river basin shrb liaohe river basin lrb haihe river basin hairb huaihe river basin huairb yangtze river basin yzrb yellow river basin yrb pearl river basin prb southeast river basin serb southwest river basin swrb and northwest river basin nwrb additional geographic information for the ten rivers was listed in supplementary table 1 2 2 dataset the annual sediment load data of 70 hydrological stations fig 1 from 1956 to 2019 were obtained from the water resources committee and the river sediment bulletin of china among these 53 stations had 63 years continuous observed data in the period of 1956 to 2019 9 stations had over 40 years data mainly in the lrb hairb and serb and the remaining 8 stations had 30 years continuous observed data mostly in the nwrb and serb a total of 781 climate stations with daily meteorological variables including temperature and precipitation were obtained from the china national climate center http data cma cn all the hydro climatic data have been checked to guarantee their quality and consistency the dams and reservoirs data were obtained from the geo referenced global dam and reservoir database wang et al 2021a the terraces data in 2018 were obtained from cao et al 2021 the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index of the study area at 1998 2008 and 2018 was synthesized data based on spot vegetation proba v 1 km product xu 2018 3 methodologies 3 1 temporal trends and abrupt changes trends in sediment load and climate extremes were analyzed by means of the non parametric mann kendall mk test kendall 1990 mann 1945 and sen s slope sen and kumar 1968 these methods have been frequently used to quantify the significance of trends in hydro meteorological time series douglas et al 2000 partal and kahya 2006 pettitt test method was employed to detect the abrupt changing year of the annual sediment load during the study time series pettitt 1979 yacoub and tayfur 2019 zhao et al 2009 according to the abrupt changing points the entire study period was divided into two stages reference period named period i and changing period named period ii 3 2 climate indices climate extremes were the driving forces of many natural disasters such as floods droughts heat waves leading to severe disaster risk in regions a total of 27 climate extremes indices have been defined by the ipcc to investigate climate extreme changes and their potential risks alexander et al 2006 dulière et al 2011 min et al 2013 sillmann et al 2013 in addition heavy rain r25 rainstorm r50 erosive rainfall daily rainfall 12 mm r12 and erosive rainfall days rd12 were considered as important indices affecting soil erosion and sediment load angulo martínez and beguería 2009 wang et al 2016c in total we selected 15 climate extremes indices table 1 since they were confirmed to strongly influence the sediment load lenzi and marchi 2000 xie et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 among the selected fifteen indices two indices reflect the temperature annual mean temperature tmean and max daily temperature tmax and seven indices are related to precipitation extremes including heavy precipitation amount r25 heavy precipitation days rd25 rainstorm amount r50 rainstorm days rd50 and the maximum precipitation amount in 3 d rx3 5 d rx5 and 7 d rx7 the remaining metrics are annual total wet day precipitation pwet potential evapotranspiration pet rainy days rds erosive rainfall r12 erosive rainfall days rd12 and precipitation amount in flood period fsptot the daily pet was calculated according to the penman monteith equation allen 1998 and then summed to the annual value 3 3 partial least squares regression in this study we used the partial least squares regression plsr to detect the linkages between annual sediment load and climate extremes indices the plsr explores the relationships between an independent set of climate variables x n m arranged in a matrix with n observations and m variables and the dependent vector of annual sediment load y the plsr searches the components of x that best predict y abdi 2010 carrascal et al 2009 the first step of plsr is to decompose the independent and dependent variables expressed as 1 x t p t e x 2 y u w t e y where t and u are the n k scores matrices k is the number of components p and w are the m k weights matrices and e is the residual matrix n m x and y are maintained by 4 u b t where b n n is determined by least squares minimization to further obtain the regression coefficient a key step to obtain a model with an acceptable predictive capability is the selection of the optimal number of plsr components this number was determined by cross validation to achieve an optimal balance between the explained variation in the response r2 and the predictive ability of the model goodness of prediction q2 abdi 2010 onderka et al 2012 another goodness of fit criterion recommended by asce task committee 1993 is nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 calculated with the eq 6 the value of nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 an efficiency of 1 0 corresponds to a perfect match between observed and modelled data whereas a negative value of nse represents unreliable model 5 r 2 t 1 n p i p m o i o m 2 t 1 n p i p m 2 o i o m 2 6 q 2 1 0 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 7 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 where p i and q i are the predicted and observed annual sediment load for the ith year of an n year data series and m is the number of plsr components p i is the predicted sediment load for the leave one out sample the optimal number of plsr components frequently corresponds to a minimal rmse and maximum q cum 2 lopez et al 2008 luedeling and gassner 2012 8 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n then a set of regression coefficients b plsr were calibrated from the optimized plsr model these coefficients were then applied to predict the dependent variable y pred as 9 y pred x b plsr e for the reference period the mean of the predicted sediment load in matrix y pred was equal to the observed sediment load thus a regression equation between climatic variables and sediment load was developed and evaluated the meaning of each component was indicated by the weights w i attained in matrix p t which can be used to quantify the relationship between the predictors and response in different components lopez et al 2008 the importance of the variable was represented by vip the variable importance for the projection which was equal to the sum of the squares of the plsr weights across all components a variable with a score greater than one was considered to be a significant predominant predictor for sediment load luedeling and gassner 2012 3 4 double mass curve the double mass curve dmc has been widely used in hydrologic analysis as it can be easily used to estimate the stage change of hydrological series and quantify the influencing factors through eliminating minor trend effects in the time series deng et al 2021 li et al 2022a restrepo and syvitski 2006 searcy and hardison 1960 walling 2006 the dmc between annual precipitation and sediment load clearly reflects the impacts of human activities the period i represents the reference period when no intensive human activities occurred while the period ii represents the changing period which is associated with significant human activities thus for a given sediment load time series the total change in mean annual sediment load δ s l tot can be calculated as 10 δ s l tot s l 2 obs s l 1 obs where s l 1 obs and s l 2 obs are the mean annual sediment load observed in the period i and period ii respectively the regression equation obtained according to the optimal climate indicator determined by plsr for a given catchment during the period i was used to predict climate driven sediment load in period ii the difference between the predicted mean sediment load in period ii and the observed value for the period i represents the change in mean annual sediment load due to climate variability δ s l c lim 11 δ s l c lim s l 2 c lim s l 1 obs where s l 2 c lim is the mean annual sediment load predicted by climate variables in period ii which assumed that the sediment load has not been influenced by significant human activities therefore the δ s l c lim is the change in sediment load due to climate only similarly the difference between s l 2 c lim and s l 2 obs is the sediment load change resulted from human activities δ s l hum during the period 12 δ s l hum s l 2 obs s l 2 c lim 4 results 4 1 changes of sediment load 4 1 1 temporal trends of sediment load the temporal changing trends of sediment load were detected by mann kendall test and sen s slope test in the past six decades fig 2 the results showed that 54 of the 70 hydrological stations had a significant decreasing trend in sediment load and only 2 stations had an increasing trend the remaining stations showed no significant trend and were mainly concentrated in the nwrb and serb when focusing on the river mouth stations fig 3 annual total sediment load in ten rivers had been decreased from 1842 18 mt yr in the 1960s to 322 72 mt yr in the 2010s with a decrease of 82 48 in the 1960s the yrb yzrb and prb delivered the highest sediment load accounting for 96 22 of the total sediment load in the mainland china however by the 2010s the yrb yzrb and nwrb became the main sediment load basins accounting for 88 64 of the total the sediment load contribution rates of yrb decreased from 65 36 in the 1960s to 39 15 in the 2010s whereas yzrb increased from 26 73 to 37 65 during the same period the sediment load of the yrb reached more than 1 6 billion t yr in the 1960s much higher than those of other river basins but it dropped to about 170 mt yr with the highest reduction rate of the ten river basins by the 2010s in the 1960s the annual sediment load of the yzrb ranged from 400 to 500 mt yr reduced to 100 mt yr in the 2010s the changes in the middle and lower yzrb were responsible for the significant reduction the sediment load of mainstream stations in the prb was 50 60 mt yr in the 1950s and reduced by 80 in the 2010s in the 1960s annual sediment load in the lrb hairb and huairb were all lower than 30 mt yr during 2010s it reduced to 3 mt yr the hairb even decreased to zero the trend of sediment load in other basins was not obvious relatively 4 1 2 abrupt changes in annual sediment load as fig 4 and fig 5 shown the results of the pettitt test indicated that most of the river basins had significant abrupt changing points p 0 01 mainly occurred during 1985 2002 for example the annual sediment load at stations in the yrb had abrupt changes during 1985 2002 especially during 1994 2002 in the upper and middle reaches the changing points of shrb occurred after 1982 and the changing points in the lrb concentrated in 1994 2002 the significant change points in the hairb were concentrated in 1979 1999 however the abrupt changes in the nwrb and swrb were not significant the remaining abrupt changes of sediment load mainly occurred after 2002 concentrated in the nwrb and swrb which may be related to the construction and operation of hydropower facilities especially in the heihe river reservoir construction began in 2001 and seven cascade hydropower stations were built successively the construction of hydropower stations changed the natural hydrological process of the river and affected the change of sediment load 4 2 changes in climate extremes indices fig 6 displayed the changing trends of the selected extreme climatic indices the temporal trends of tmax varied from 0 03 to 0 07 c yr 1 with positive trends in the northern and central china and negative trends in the northwestern and southeastern china tmean showed an increasing trend in the mainland of china the temperature increased gradually from south to north especially in northern china the range of trends for pwet 3 54 3 61 mm yr 1 r12 3 00 3 95 mm yr 1 was similar with positive slopes across the chinese mainland except for a small area had negative slopes negative slopes of r50 1 93 3 58 mm yr 1 were observed in the most of the study region with positive slopes only in the southeast the trends of fsptot ranged from 3 28 to 2 45 mm yr 1 with positive trends in the majority of study area and negative trends in the northeast the rds trends varied from 0 25 to 0 41 d yr 1 with positive slopes observed in the majority of study areas and negative slopes in the central china positive trend of rd12 was observed across the majority of the study area with negative values in the parts of western and eastern in contrast the changing trends of rd25 0 05 0 09 d yr 1 and rd50 0 04 0 04 d yr 1 decreased throughout the study area except for a small area in the southeast it can be observed that temperature and precipitation amounts across the study area increased and climate extremes became relatively more intense the changing trends of these climatic extremes had high spatial heterogeneity resulting in substantial influences on sediment load change 4 3 relationship between sediment load and climate extremes indices 4 3 1 correlation analysis the pearson method was applied to investigate the correlation between sediment load and the selected climate extremes supplementary fig 1 negative correlation coefficients were found between sediment load and the tmean tmax and pet at the majority of hydrological stations whereas positive correlation coefficients of tmean and tmax were observed in the shrb most of the rainfall extreme indices were positively correlated with sediment load in majority of basins for example the correlation coefficients between annual sediment load and pwet were higher than 0 6 in the yrb huairb and serb showing their strong correlation positive correlation was examined between sediment load and fsptot in the huairb and serb compared with period i the correlation between sediment load and extreme climate during the period ii became weaker in most basins especially in yrb and yzrb for instance the correlation between pwet and fsptot and sediment load mostly decreased from about 0 6 to 0 4 in the yrb in other basins there was no significant change in correlation between sediment load and climate extremes while the relationship was enhanced in a few basins such as shrb and huairb 4 3 2 plsr modeling the plsr model was constructed for each catchment in period i to reveal the relationship between annual sediment load and climate extreme variables table 2 summarized the statistical results of the plsr models for the major rivers in period i overall most models cumulatively explained more than 60 of the total variance in the annual sediment load whereas the first component appeared to explain over 40 of the total variance indicating the robustness of the plsr model the results of plsr model were reliable with low values of rmse and high nse according to the correlation coefficients and vip values of climate extremes obtained by plsr we determined the key climate extreme variables that dominantly influenced the annual sediment load changes as shown in fig 7 the horizontal and vertical axes represented the first and second correlation coefficients respectively the circle size denotes the vip value the red circles have the vip 1 0 and the blue circles have the vip 1 0 the variables with scores greater than 1 can be considered as dominant factor influencing sediment load taking yanchi station of hairb as an example r50 was the most significant influencing factor to sediment load according to both correlation coefficient and vip value the dominant factors affecting sediment load for each basin were determined by the plsr method the correlations between sediment load and climate extreme indices showed high spatial patterns in different river basins fig 8 lu et al 2013 in contrast pwet r12 and fsptot were found to be the dominant influencing factors in most river basins pwet played a key role in sediment load changes in the yzrb and yrb the changes of sediment load in the prb were most closely related to r12 and r50 in the nwrb swrb and serb fsptot was observed to be the most important factors influencing sediment load 4 3 3 contribution of sediment load changes the contribution of climate change and human activities to the variations of sediment load was estimated by the dmc between sediment load and selected climate extremes variables fig 9 obviously human activities were found to be the dominant factor to the changes of sediment load in the study basins the contribution rates of human activities ranged from 56 to 99 in the yrb human activities had relatively higher contributions to sediment load changes than those in the other river basins with the contribution of more than 85 at many stations in the yzrb we found that human activities accounted for more than 80 on sediment load changes at 64 stations sediment load changes at only approximately 17 of the stations which were mainly distributed in the shrb nwrb swrb and serb can be dominantly attributed to climate change and the contributions of climate change ranged from 84 to 99 but human activities had a negative effect on sediment load changes at these stations 5 discussion 5 1 changes of sediment load and attributions annual sediment load of the most rivers experienced significantly decreasing trends p 0 01 especially the yzrb and yrb whereas sediment load in the serb nwrb and swrb showed no significant trends and even slightly increase in some stations apparently sediment load showed increase trend in the tibetan rivers due to evident warming li et al 2021a whereas the annual sediment load in nwrb showed consistent trends since the climate was getting wetter tian et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in shrb both climate warming and human activities aggravated soil erosion resulting in a larger sediment load meanwhile a series of ecological restoration projects such as natural forest protection project and returning farmland to forest and grassland had led to significant reduction in sediment load at some stations li et al 2009 sui et al 2018 as for the yrb and yzrb human activities induced significant reduction in annual sediment load wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2017b it can be clearly seen that abrupt changes of annual sediment load were ascribed to the construction of hydraulic engineering works fig 10 and the implementation of water and soil conservation projects generally reservoirs construction was an important factor for sediment load changes in the mainstream stations boix fayos et al 2007 smith et al 2016 for instance the three gorge dam tgd was responsible for the abrupt change in sediment load at datong and yichang stations indicating their substantial trapping effects guo et al 2022 zhao et al 2017b in the yrb several large scale reservoirs built in the 1980s such as bapanxia reservoir longyangxia reservoir and lijiaxia reservoir were the dominate factor for abrupt changes of sediment load at lanzhou and tougaoduai stations in addition zhang et al 2012b and zhang and lu 2009 found that the alteration of sediment load at boluo station was the result of the construction of fengshuba reservoir and xinfengjiang reservoir in the prb for tributaries soil and water conservation measures and small and medium sized water conservancy projects jointly affected the change of sediment load such as terraces fig 11 and vegetation restoration fig 12 table 3 for example significant abrupt changes were detected in 1999 in many tributaries due to the initiation of the grain for green project in the yrb guan et al 2019 miao et al 2011 and more than 58 000 check dams and 5 5 104 km2 terraces have been built and the vegetation coverage has increased from 28 8 in 1980 to 65 in 2020 in the loess plateau leading to approximately 90 reduction of sediment load in the yrb ran et al 2020 wu et al 2020a similarly a total of 11 931 reservoirs have been built up by the end of 1980s with a total storage capacity of 20 5 billion m3 in the yzrb china river sediment bulletin these reservoirs have trapped large amount of sediment from upstream similar results were also found in other basins such as shrb serb and prb where large reservoirs in the mainstream played significant role in sediment trapping and the soil and water conservation measures had great effects on sediment load changes in the tributaries dai et al 2007 guo et al 2012 wu et al 2016 especially in the 1980s intensive human activities such as soil conservation projects irrigation water abstraction mining etc resulted in abrupt changes in sediment load fig 5 zhang et al 2012 a large number of studies have found that intensive human activities were the mainly driving forces to the changes in sediment load wang et al 2016b wu et al 2020b zhao et al 2017a many of them indicated that climate change contributed 20 30 to sediment load changes in the yrb zhao et al 2009 zhao et al 2017a 3 28 in the yzrb dai et al 2008 guo et al 2022 wei and he 2012 and 12 80 in the prb liu et al 2014a liu et al 2014b while the results of our study showed that precipitation changes contributed far 20 in the yrb and yzrb and about 20 in the prb in these basins the rainfall variables had upwards trends and supposed to result in increase of soil erosion and sediment load however such increases might be offset by reservoir trapping and other activities dai et al 2008 in the lrb hairb and huairb precipitation variable showed decreasing trends which led to a downward trend in sediment load this indicated that human activities such as reservoirs construction soil and water conservation vegetation restoration and land use changes could greatly reduce soil erosion and sediment load in the basins buendia et al 2016 latrubesse et al 2009 rengers et al 2016 topping et al 2018 5 2 linkage between sediment load and climate extremes the changes of sediment load were closely related to extreme precipitation such as pwet r12 and fsptot and were weakly related to extreme temperatures it has been confirmed that extreme precipitation was a key factor influencing the changes of sediment load dulière et al 2011 nowbuth 2016 especially in the regions with large scale soil conservation measures pan et al 2013 rengers et al 2016 for example the loess plateau experienced significant changes land surface with large amount of terraces and dams construction and vegetation improvement large storms with high rainfall erosivity contributed great proportion to the total sediment load in the rivers feng et al 2020 teng et al 2019 yin et al 2019 in this study annual sediment load at hejin huayuankou and lijin stations was more closely related to r25 and r50 in yrb similarly good correlation between sediment load and r25 was detected in the karst area of the xijiang river the largest tributary of the prb li et al 2021b extreme rainfall has strong effect on soil erosion processes which in turn affects river sediment load raindrops strike soil surface causing more splash erosion furthermore heavy rainfall can more easily saturates the soil yielding surface water which flushes the surface soil forming rills and gullies thus intense or prolonged rainfall has the most important role in the formation of ephemeral gullies and the generation of muddy floods leading to high sediment load boardman 2015 li et al 2021c rengers et al 2016 wei et al 2007 in the nwrb and swrb sediment load were more closely related to extreme temperature which can be ascribed to the snowmelt in mountains tian et al 2020 similarly zhang et al 2020 found that sediment load changes were more sensitive to temperature in tibet the increase in temperature led to the melting of glaciers and increase of runoff resulted in increased erosive power and transport capacity of the river flow additionally permafrost degradation became potential sediment sources resulting in increase of sediment load due to prolonged unfrozen time and freezing thawing cycles zeng et al 2018 the relationship between sediment load and climate extremes became weaker when comparing the period ii to period i at many stations in the basins particularly in the yrb and yzrb annual sediment load decreased due to various human activities e g soil and water conservation measures optimized the topography and vegetation restoration projects catam et al 2002 ouchi 2015 rmkens et al 2002 in period ii whereas the climate extremes showed no significant changes however sediment load was more closely related to climate extremes in the shrb and huairb according to the changes of ndvi in table 3 the vegetation coverage in these two basins did not increase rapidly many studies suggested that inappropriate human activities disturbed land surface and destroyed forested land which intensified the soil erosion in the basins sui et al 2018 zhong et al 2017 5 3 perspectives for basin management overall annual sediment load showed significant decrease in many river basins p 0 01 particularly in the yrb and yzrb human activities such as dams reservoirs and vegetation restoration contributed more than 80 to sediment changes great reduction of sediment load may result in delta erosion and shoreline retreat which in turn made delta shrink and sea water intrusion and further induced heavy damages in flood mitigation and habitats environment blum and roberts 2009 grams and schmidt 2005 topping et al 2018 the dramatic changes in sediment load may generate additional challenges in river basin management due to delta changes river channel flushing reservoirs deposition and nutrients and organic matters transport through land to ocean gao et al 2018 kong et al 2015 wang et al 2016b among the major rivers only several hydrological stations had increasing trends in annual sediment load mainly distributed in nwrb swrb and shrb climate warming is the dominant driving force inducing glacier melting and permafrost degradation the river sediment in the nwrb and swrb more sensitive to temperature increase tian et al 2020 zeng et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 thus great efforts are needed to reduce carbon emission and promote sustainable climate smart practices to slow climate warming though numerous ecological restoration measures have been implemented in majority of the river basins leading to great reduction in annual sediment load some regions were still suffered from unreasonable reclamation the extreme rainfall events could produce severe floods and considerable soil erosion on the disturbed soil destro et al 2018 gonzalez hidalgo et al 2007 pingping et al 2018 such as areas in shrb in such case sustainable agricultural measures should be undertaken during the farming activities apparently a series of soil and water conservation measures have been undertaken in large areas in china accordingly the vegetation cover has increased 11 and the terraced arable land reached 5 85 105 km2 and about one hundred thousand dams have been built cao et al 2021 song et al 2020 wang et al 2021a these measures resulted in significant reduction in annual sediment load at many stations in the studied rivers it convinced the success of soil and water conservation measures in reducing soil erosion and improvement of ecological environment however extreme events occurred more frequently and led to more severe flood disasters alimohammadlou et al 2014 osterkamp and friedman 2000 pingping et al 2018 this presented great challenges for soil conservation measures to adapt extreme climate events high quality and optimized layout of conservation measures are needed to protect regions suffered from large floods and severe soil loss 6 conclusions this study demonstrated temporal trends and spatial patterns of sediment load variations in chinese major rivers during the past sixty decades meanwhile using plsr and correlation analysis to select crucial factors affecting sediment load changes and quantify the contribution of climate and human activities to sediment load the main conclusions as follows the annual sediment load of most rivers in china 77 1 decreased significantly p 0 01 especially in the yzrb and yrb the sediment load of the nwrb and swrb was detected with no significant change most of the change points of sediment load were concentrated in 1985 2000 showing high spatial and temporal heterogeneities due to various human activities overall temperature and precipitation across the study area increased and extremes became relatively more intense the correlation between sediment load and climate extremes decreased after changing point in the most of study areas the dominant climate variables affecting sediment load were precipitation extremes including pwet annual total wet day precipitation r12 erosive precipitation and fsptot precipitation amount in flood period extreme temperature affected sediment load changes in nwrb and swrb which was related to snowmelt in the mountains and permafrost degradation the changes of sediment load were mostly dominated by human activities with different contribution proportions in different basins the large reservoirs or dams were responsible for sediment load changes in the mainstream whereas climate extremes events and soil conservation projects were responsible for the changes in tributaries changes in extreme precipitation had critical roles in sediment load changes in the shrb nwrb and swrb where the influences of soil conservation measures human activities were limited credit authorship contribution statement yatong zhang conceptualization formal
