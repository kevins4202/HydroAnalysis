23750,fluid structure investigations in hydraulic machines using coupled simulations based on dynamical re mesh are particularly time consuming this paper presents an implementation of an immersed boundary ib method for dynamical boundary flowing problem in a flow solver based on the fractional time step method and the finite different method which is validated by a basic numerical example the hydrofoil which is surrounded by incompressible flow is modeled with forced pitching motions to seek better understanding of the coupled hydrodynamic performance of an oscillating fully active hydrofoil a forced motion of non sinusoidal oscillating is investigated for different pitching frequencies f and maximum angle amplitude θ 0 as well as profile parameter β effects of non sinusoidal pitching motion on the hydrodynamic load and power input performance are investigated under different pitching motional parameters the results show that the time averaged input power gradually increases with both the pitching frequency f and profile parameter β while it decreases with the maximum pitching amplitudeθ 0 the instantaneous peak value of input power also increases with both the pitching frequency f and profile parameter β rising up in addition the flow fields for different motional parameters are discussed the different vortex evolutions for various β and pitching frequency remind us that the flow around a flapping foil is complicated and strongly related to the unsteady hydrodynamics the present research results are helpful to control strategy design for the hydrofoil movement in the operating process of turbine unit keywords hydrofoil hydrodynamic performance non sinusoidal oscillating profile immersed boundary method power input 1 introduction fluid structure interactions play a significant role in many engineering applications design and control especially in hydraulic machinery for instance marine and hydrokinetic devices for capturing energy from waves tides and currents in oceans rivers and streams are at the developing stage but have significant potential to contribute to the future supply of renewable clean energy and a pump turbine often need to transfer between the pump case and turbine case with the operation of a hydrofoil or guide vane a rotor stator interaction will induce pressure fluctuations in the turbine passage which can lead to vibration of the guide vane blade or resonance in the distributor channels zobeiri et al 2006 nicolet et al 2006 the vortex shedding and pressure fluctuations can also induce the runner blade vibration and fracture wang et al 2010a b zhang et al 2009 the flow induced vibrations of the guide vane excited by a periodic vortex shedding ausoni et al 2007 can also lead to premature cracks furthermore transient processes in hydraulic turbines are transitions from one operating point to another controlled by the rotation of a hydrofoil or guide vane as well as valves or wicket gates opening upstream the application of a payload to the generator or other means examples of such processes are power increase decrease runaway and emergency turbine shutdown the majority pass far from the best efficiency point in areas of unstable operation where strong unsteadiness of the flow is observed wang et al 2009 cherny et al 2010 li et al 2010 moreover most of the transient processes are associated with significant discharge changes causing water hammer waves that travel back and forth through the whole water system furthermore vortices shed around the rotating guide vane may enter into the runner blade passage and often induces strong vibration of the unit gorla et al 2005 jiang et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 wang et al 2009 these characteristics of transient processes make the task of simulating them rather complex thus there is strong interest to study the forced oscillating behavior of hydrofoil or guide vane to design safe and reliable turbines or pump turbines in recent years many studies are mainly concentrated in the fully active flapping foils the role of a number of parameters is investigated including foil kinematics foil and system geometry as well as flow physics effects young et al 2014 kinsey and dumas 2008 investigated the power generation capability of a single naca0015 foil with a viscous navier stokes flow solver and their subsequent work has become a de facto standard against which to validate the performance of numerical codes in the power generation problem campobasso and drofelnik 2012a b yu and wang 2013 le et al 2013 tian et al 2014a b 2015 wu et al 2015a b c wu et al 2015a b c wu et al 2014 2015 found that the power extraction performance could be improved by placing the foil near a wall on sinusoidal oscillating motions have also been introduced to enhance the efficiency of energy harvesting system xiao et al 2012 adopted a trapezoidal like pitching profile by varying the key parameter which controls the shape of the pitching profile they found an optimal profile which was proved to dramatically increase the power output and energy harvesting efficiency over a wide range of strouhal numbers ashraf et al 2011 reported that 15 enhancement of efficiency could be achieved by adopting non sinusoidal pitch plunge motions a comparison between the effects of different non sinusoidal motions was carried out by lu et al 2014 according to the numerical simulations by xie et al 2014 they believed that relatively high flapping frequency and large pitching amplitude should be chosen for the best energy harvesting performance platzer et al 2009 also indicated that the feasibility of efficiency enhancement by non sinusoidal motions at different operation parameters had not been well investigated munch et al 2010 presented an alternative method that linearizes the hydrodynamic load of a rigid oscillating hydrofoil the hydrofoil which is modeled with forced and free pitching motions where the mean incidence angle is 0 with a maximum angle amplitude of 2 though all studies reviewed above focused on fully active flapping foils their efforts indicate a possibility of increasing the operating efficiency of a foil by adopting non sinusoidal pitching motions however we note that none of these studies has covered the true movement parametric range for a forced movement of hydrofoil or guide vane of turbine therefore clarification on this issue is required by investigating the input power and hydrodynamic behaviors adopting a wider parameter range and more movement mode furthermore the effects of energy input and hydrodynamic performance under sinusoidal motions are less investigated for different pitching motions for the hydrofoil or guide vane movement of the hydro turbine simultaneously we also notice that the flowing mechanism around hydrofoil is closely interrelated to the flow reynolds number in this paper an intermediate reynolds number at experimental condition in lab is selected although it is largely lower than that of the prototype hydraulic machines these basic regular flowing patterns in low reynolds number is also deserved to study coupled simulations for complex geometries like hydraulic machines are extremely time consuming using either the classical or integrated method based on the re meshing technology the traditional method is straightforward domain time discretizations with accurate and efficient numerical algorithm and good results are usually achieved for flows involving stationary boundaries and simple geometries in fact industrially relevant flows usually involve moving boundaries and complex geometries where the computation becomes more computationally expensive and less efficient and even failure due to the complexities of the geometries in addition traditional body fitted methods usually need tedious grid generation from the solid boundary these arguments support the common statement that the adequate treatment of complex geometric configurations is one of the main obstacles for the application of cfd as a standard design tool in industry therefore great effort has been made to develop adaptive fixed mesh technologies in the last two decades one of them is the immersed boundary ib method therefore in this paper an implicit direct forcing ib method based on the fixed mesh is proposed to simulation for a rigid oscillating hydrofoil or guide vane in the ib method the solid part can act as an elastic body or a rigid body traditionally the ib approaches for complex flows involving moving boundaries and complex geometries can be divided into two main categories the feedback forcing approach and the direct forcing approach the feedback forcing ib approach developed by goldstein et al 1993 determines the singular body force using the differences of velocity and displacement between the ib calculated values and the physical ones on the ib points with two empirical constants although this feedback forcing approach has proved successful for simulating flows past both stationary and moving cylinders le et al 2009 the empirical constants are arbitrary and vary for different flows in addition this method suffers from the instability caused by the inherent feedback nature of the method to overcome this difficulty the direct forcing ib approach was introduced fadlun et al 2000 vikhansky 2003 chiu et al 2010 tian et al 2014a b in this approach the body force is directly deduced from the momentum equation by setting the velocity at ib points to the desired velocity using interpolation distribution functions in this manner the boundary conditions are satisfied on the ib points the direct forcing ib method has been used successfully by many researchers in a variety of applications for example wu and shu 2009 developed a correction method for the velocity on the cartesian grids near the immersed boundary directly to the boundary conditions on the fluid solid interface instead of using the interpolation distribution functions this method is simple robust and easy of implementation which were demonstrated by simulating several benchmark problems based on the idea of ref wu and shu 2009 ren et al 2012 used boundary condition enforced immersed boundary method for thermal flow problems with the dirichlet temperature condition easy implementation and robustness in stability were reported in this paper a direct forcing ib method solver for flow a forced motion of a guide vane of turbine is simulated the rest of this paper is organized as follows the governing equations and its relation to the ib method will be introduced in section 2 1 and the velocity correction and space discretization are simply described in section 2 2 and section 2 3 respectively then the validity of the numerical method is shown in section 2 4 the case study and describes is introduced in section 3 the numerical simulations results of the non sinusoidal forced oscillating of guide vane are then discussed in section 4 finally the paper is concluded by closing remarks in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations the influence of the immersed boundary on the fluid is often represented by forces exerted on the fluid to impose the no slip condition at the immersed boundary therefore the governing equations of this fluid structure interaction system are the usual incompressible navier stokes equations the conservative form of the second order adams bashforth temporal discretized governing equations of incompressible fluid flow using the ib method are 1 u n 1 0 and 2 u n 1 u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 3 2 p n 1 2 p n 1 f n 1 2 δ t where u and p are respectively the velocity and pressure δ t is time step the superscript n represents nth time step r s h u u ν u u t comprised of the convection and diffusive terms and f represents the boundary body force density ν is the kinetic viscosity here we introduce two functions c ϕ and d φ which represent the interpolation and distribution functions respectively note that the distribution function maps the physical field from the ib points to the cartesian grids on the other hand the interpolation function projects the physical field from the cartesian grids back to the ib points the lower case ϕ represents the variables on the cartesian mesh x j such as u p f etc and the upper case φ indicates the variables on the ib points x i e g u f etc suppose that the immersed boundary is represented by a set of ib points x i i 1 2 m and the fluid field is discretized by a fixed uniform cartesian mesh x j j 1 2 n with mesh spacing δ x δ y h furthermore the variable φ x i on the ib points can be calculated as 3 φ x i c ϕ x i j δ j i ϕ x j h 2 j 1 2 n i 1 2 m where the discrete delta function adopted is those suggested by peskin 2002 i e 4 δ j i δ x i x j 1 h 2 φ x i x j h φ y i y j h where φ r can be written as 5 φ r 1 8 3 2 r 1 4 r 4 r 2 0 r 1 1 8 5 2 r 7 12 r 4 r 2 1 r 2 0 2 r the same way the variable ϕ x j on the cartesian grids can be calculated as 6 ϕ x j d φ x j i δ i j φ x i h 2 j 1 2 n i 1 2 m the purpose of ib method is to set the boundary conditions on the immersed boundary exactly namely satisfies the no slip and no penetration conditions for a viscous fluid the velocity at the ib point interpolated from the corrected fluid velocity field via the smooth delta function δ i j must be equal to the boundary physical velocity v n 1 at the same position this can be expressed as 7 u n 1 v n 1 where 8 u n 1 c u n 1 substituting the discretized momentum equation eq 2 and eq 8 into eq 7 gives 9 v n 1 u n 1 c u n 1 c u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 3 2 p n 1 2 p n 1 c f n 1 2 δ t we noted that f n 1 2 δ t c f n 1 2 δ t in which f n 1 2 represents the boundary body force density on the ib points then we distribute this body force f n 1 2 to the cartesian grids as 10 d f n 1 2 δ t d c f n 1 2 δ t d v n 1 c u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 3 2 p n 1 2 p n 1 this body force on the cartesian grids is finally defined as 11 f n 1 2 δ t d v n 1 c u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 3 2 p n 1 2 p n 1 2 2 velocity correction with the help of classical fractional step technique the velocity field can be obtained in the following predictor corrector steps 2 2 1 prediction step start with the normal navier stokes equations without the forcing term calculate the intermediate velocity u n 12 u n u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 1 2 p n 1 then the immediate velocity u n is corrected to the predicted velocity u n by the following form 13 u n u n δ t 3 2 p n before the use of eq 13 the pressure field should be obtained first by solving the following poisson equation which is derived from satisfying of continuity equation by u n 14 2 p n 2 3 δ t u n once the pressure field is known which can be substituted into eq 11 the forcing term f n 1 2 can be obtained in the specific implementation process a staggered grid is used for the finite difference discretization of eq 12 that is scalar variable like pressure is defined at the center of each cell while velocity components are defined at the cell faces 2 2 2 corrector step the corrected velocity field can be obtained by solving the following equation with the forcing term f n 1 2 15 u n 1 u n δ t f n 1 2 in this velocity correction method the body force is not pre calculated but implicitly determined in such a way that the velocity at the immersed boundary interpolated from the corrected velocity field accurately satisfies the no slip and no penetration conditions in our paper we use the implicit velocity correction method combined finite different discretized method to simulate fluid flow 2 3 space discretization we assume that φ is the fluid variable on the interior cartesian node the convective term such as ϕ ϕ x etc can be discretized as 16 ϕ ϕ x ϕ i j 2 δ x ϕ i 1 j ϕ i 1 j ϕ c f δ x ϕ i 1 j 3 ϕ i j 3 ϕ i 1 j ϕ i 2 j ϕ c f δ x ϕ i 2 j 3 ϕ i 1 j 3 ϕ i j ϕ i 1 j where φ 1 2 φ i j φ i j φ 1 2 φ i j φ i j c f 0 125 to diffusive terms such as 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 etc can be discretized as 17 2 φ x 2 φ i 1 j 2 φ i j φ i 1 j δ x 2 2 φ y 2 φ i j 1 2 φ i j φ i j 1 δ y 2 the pressure poisson equation can be discretized as 18 p i 1 j 2 p i j p i 1 j δ x 2 p i j 1 2 p i j p i j 1 δ y 2 2 3 δ t u i 1 j u i 1 j 2 δ x v i j 1 v i j 1 2 δ y to the boundary cartesian nodes the upwind discretization is used such as to the left boundary i 0 diffusive terms can be expressed as 19 2 φ x 2 φ i j 2 φ i 1 j φ i 2 j δ x 2 φ 0 j 2 φ 1 j φ 2 j δ x 2 and the right term of pressure poisson equation can be expressed as 20 2 3 x u δ t y v δ t 2 3 δ t u 1 j u 0 j δ x v 0 j 1 v 0 j 1 2 δ y 2 4 validity of the numerical method flow over a static and rotating circular cylinder is simulated to verify that the present immersed boundary method predicts flow phenomena such as separation and vortex shedding very well the size of the computational domain is 15d 10d where d denotes the diameter of the cylinder which is shown in fig 1 computations are performed for re 200 based on the free stream velocity u and the diameter with the maximum cfl number of 0 8 the numbers of uniform grid points are 600 400 in the streamwise x and transverse y directions respectively and 126 grid points in each direction are uniformly distributed within the cylinder diameter a dirichlet boundary condition u u v 0 is used at the inflow and far field boundaries and a convective boundary condition u x v x 0 is used for the outflow boundary computations are performed at three different rotating velocities of the cylinder namely ω 0 5 ω 1 and ω 2 0 the time step is δ t 2 10 3 prior to t 160 the cylinder is static afterwards the cylinder is uniformly rotating here all physical quantities are non dimensional by the length scale d and time scale d u once the velocity field and pressure fields have been computed the drag and lift coefficients and the strouhal number can be computed from the force at the control points in table 1 the drag and lift coefficients as well as the strouhal number at re 200 for the static cylinder case are compared to other numerical simulations for the static cylinder case the mean drag obtained by our algorithm is in good agreement with those computed by other researchers liu et al 1998 calhoun 2002 russell and wang 2003 le et al 2006 and slightly lower than experimental data schliching and gersten 2000 only by 3 6 the lift coefficient calculated by our method for re 200 is near to the values obtained by other researchers and our strouhal numbers are in good agreement with those given in refs liu et al 1998 calhoun 2002 russell and wang 2003 le et al 2006 for the rotating cylinder case the mean drag and lift coefficients are lower than those of the static cylinder however the amplitude of the lift coefficient is larger it is also seen that the mean drag coefficient decreases and the amplitude of the lift coefficient increases together with the rotating angular velocity increasing the strouhal number however remains mostly the same through variation of the rotating angular velocity fig 2 show the variations in time for the drag and lift coefficients these figures depict the development of the vortex shedding into a periodic state with time at re 200 it can be seen that the two minimum values are obtained in the periods under the ω 0 5 and ω 1 0 cases and contribute to the second vortex of the rotating cylinder fig 3 shows the evolution of the streamline in time the characteristics of the startup flow at this reynolds number and rotating velocity consist of a primary eddy evolving at the top of the cylinder and a second eddy developing below the x axis of symmetry fig 3a d the second eddy moves upward fig 3c and d inducing two secondary vortices fig 3f which merge to form a single vortex at time t t fig 3h the stream function contours obtained by the current study are in remarkable agreement with experimental observations coutanceau and menard 1985 and previous computational results badr and dennis 1985 to further valid our numerical method flow over a two dimensional flat plate at different large amplitude pitch up hold pitch down maneuver cases is simulated compared to the high fidelity direct numerical simulating results by brunton et al 2013 the length of flat plate is l with the thickness of 0 01 l the size of the computational domain is 10l 6l the coordinate origin point lies in the left down corner and the centre of the flat plate is in 3l 3l the flowing reynolds numbers are equal to 100 and 300 respectively based on the free stream velocity u and the length of flat plate a dirichlet boundary condition u u v 0 is used at the inflow and far field boundaries and a convective boundary condition u x v x 0 is used for the outflow boundary computations are performed at the numbers of uniform grid points is 1 000 600 in the streamwise x and transverse y directions and 202 grid points are uniformly distributed along the surface of the flat plate the time step is δ t 2 10 3 a large amplitude pitch up hold pitch down manoeuvre developed by eldredge et al 2009 to study separation phenomena in pitching aerofoils is given by the following 21 α t α 0 α m a x g t max g t g t log cosh a t t 1 cosh a t t 4 cosh a t t 2 cosh a t t 3 the manoeuvre from 21 is also used by brunton et al 2013 and the present study where α 0 is the initial angle of attack α m a x is the amplitude of pitch the parameter a 11 determines how sharp the corners are in the manoeuvre and t 1 1 t 2 3 t 3 4 t 4 6 where t is a is non dimensional time using the length of flat plate l and the free stream velocity u three cases are studied namely case 1 α 0 0 α m a x 32 re 300 and the pitch point is mid chord point and does not pitch back down to α 0 case 2 α 0 10 α m a x 15 re 100 and the pitch point is the leading edge case 3 α 0 0 α m a x 45 re 100 and the pitch point is the leading edge to valid the grid independent for case 1 three different grid scales finest middle coarse are used namely the numbers of uniform grid points are 1 500 900 1 000 600 500 300 in the streamwise x and transverse y directions respectively the intel xeon cpu 3 30ghz is used the computational time for each time step for finest middle and coarse grid are 58 534s 25 757s and 11 443s respectively fig 4 shows the variations in time for the drag and lift coefficients for case 1 at finest middle and coarse grid respectively these figures depict the development of the vortex shedding into a periodic state with time when the flat plate holding a static angle α 32 on three different meshes the results show average lift coefficients calculated by the coarse medium and fine mesh are 1 185 1 156 and 1 128 respectively and average drag coefficients are 0 927 0 918 and 0 910 respectively the difference of average lift coefficients between the medium mesh and the fine mesh is less than 3 and the difference of average lift coefficients between the medium mesh and the fine mesh is only 0 8 therefore we adopt the medium mesh of 1 000 600 in the following simulations it is also seen that the amplitude of lift and drag coefficients by brunton et al 2013 is little higher than our present results the comparison of present computational results for case 2 with dns results brunton et al 2013 is shown in fig 5 we can see that the present lift coefficient matches the dns very closely although there are some different to predict the local peak value at the sharp transferring times among the pitch up hold and pitch down stages it is also shown the vorticity distribution at different time in a steady oscillating period which is similar to dns results brunton et al 2013 it is important to predict the lift coefficient at large amplitude manoeuvres with significant flow separation for this reason we consider a number of large amplitude pitch manoeuvres and investigate the predicting performance case 3 for the pitch up hold pitch down manoeuvre from 0 to 45 and back down given by eq 21 and shown in fig 6 it is also seen that the changing trend of lift coefficient with time does surprisingly well with the dns results brunton et al 2013 considering the large separated flow structures although there is a little difference during each phase of the manoeuvre 3 set up the hydrofoil used in the numerical cases is a guide vane of a test hydro turbine model a two dimensional foil is shown in fig 7 the chord length of the foil is a the maximum thick of the hydrofoil h 0 179a the relative camber of the hydrofoil is 0 019 the pivoting point is located at the center line of the foil with a distance b 0 466 a from the leading edge the upstream flow velocity is denoted by u the flow reynolds number re u a ν 800 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water the size of the computational domain is 15a 10a the numbers of uniform grid points are 600 400 in the streamwise x and transverse y directions respectively and 101 grid points are uniformly distributed along the hydrofoil curve surface line a dirichlet boundary condition u u v 0 is used at the inflow and far field boundaries and a convective boundary condition u x v x 0 is used for the outflow boundary for the forced motion case as seen in fig 8 the instantaneous angle of attack is denoted by θ and is expressed as 22 θ θ 0 sin β ω t 0 t π 2 β ω θ 0 π 2 β ω t π 2 ω 2 1 β θ 0 sin β ω t π 1 β π 2 ω 2 1 β t π 2 ω 2 1 β θ 0 π 2 ω 2 1 β t π 2 ω 4 1 β θ 0 sin β ω t 2 π 1 β π 2 ω 4 1 β t 2 π ω where θ 0 is the pitching amplitude the angular flapping frequency ω 2 π f it is noted that when β 1 the foil pitches sinusoidally while the pitching profile tends to be trapezoidal as β in fig 8 we plot the time variation of the pitching profile θ t for some typical values of β there is a gradual change from a sinusoid to a square wave as β increases from one dimensionless coefficients for lift drag moment and power input are defined as respectively the drag coefficient is defined as 23 c d t f d t 1 2 ρ u 2 a c where ρ is the fluid density c is the unit foil span here for two dimensional situation c 1 is selected the drag can be computed from the force along the hydrofoil interface as 24 f d t γ f x t d s where f x t is the instantaneous x component of the solid boundary force the lift coefficient is defined as 25 c l t f l t 1 2 ρ u 2 a c the lift can be computed from the force along the hydrofoil interface as 26 f l t γ f y t d s where f y t is the instantaneous y component of the solid boundary force the moment coefficient is defined as 27 c m t m t 1 2 ρ u 2 a 2 c the moment can be computed from the force along the hydrofoil interface as 28 m t γ f r d s where r is the vector from pivoting point to the foil boundary the instantaneous coefficient of power input 29 c p t p t 1 2 ρ u 3 a where the instantaneous power input actuating the pitching motion of the foil can be calculated by p t m t θ t where m t is the torque about the pivoting point and θ t is the angular velocity of the foil a 2 π a 2 2 b 2 2 a b θ 0 360 is the swept area of a flapping foil the time mean coefficients for lift drag torque and power input are calculated by the integration of instantaneous coefficients for lift drag torque and power input over five cycles 30 c d a 1 5 t u 0 5 t c d t d t c l a 1 5 t u 0 5 t c l t d t c m a 1 5 t u 0 5 t c m t d t c p a 1 5 t u 0 5 t c p t d t where t is the oscillating period of foil 4 results 4 1 statistical results fig 9 shows the time averaged drag coefficient with different pitch frequency f maximum pitching amplitude θ 0 and profile parameter β it is investigated that the time averaged drag coefficient is firstly escalation to a maximum then to decreased with f rising up at a same θ 0 when β 2 but it is abnormal when β 2 5 where the time averaged drag coefficient is sharply increased with the pitch frequency rising when the θ 0 70 which is relation with the vortex involve along the foil surface which is shown later also we can see that the time averaged drag coefficient always increased with the rising of θ 0 at a same f and β simultaneously which is also increased with the β rising at a same f and θ 0 we also notice that the time averaged drag coefficients are all positive under our present pitching parameters fig 10 is the time averaged lift coefficient with f θ 0 and β it can be seen that the time averaged lift coefficient has a slight increase in positive y direction then rapidly go down and change direction continuously keep to an upward trend in negative y direction till up to a peak value with f rising up however it is abnormal when θ 0 65 and β 2 5 also it is shown that the maximum of time average lift coefficient of each case is always variety for different β for example the maximum of time average lift coefficient is achieved at θ 0 65 for β 1 0 however which is achieved at θ 0 50 for β 2 0 in fact these differences also suggested that the complexity of flowing structure under different movement parameters such as the leading and tailing edge vortex forming and evolving as the engineering attention form the figs 9 and 10 it is concluded that the maximum shear stress to shaft of guide vane will be achieved at θ 0 75 β 2 5 and f 0 24 which is helpful to deeply understand the changing trend well and know how to use it property under different operating cases fig 11 plots the time averaged moment coefficient with d f θ 0 and β it can be seen that time averaged moment coefficient in most cases have changed the direction first it is clockwise direction positive when the pitch frequency is low then is counter clockwise negative and gradually increase with f rising up which means that more rapid of foil rotating larger input torque is required it is also can be seen that the maximum time averaged moment is achieved at θ 0 65 β 1 5 and f 1 5 case fig 12 is the time averaged input power coefficient with f θ 0 and β it is investigated that the time averaged input power coefficient shows excellent regular chance versus β which is always increasing with f rising up at the same θ 0 and β these results are also agreement with the refs lu et al 2014 teng et al 2016 these figures also show that the time averaged input power coefficient will become less when θ 0 is larger at a same pitch frequency from these figures we can conclude that more input power is required when θ 0 is more little and more rapid of pitching it is to be worth mentioning that the maximum time averaged input power is achieved at θ 0 50 β 2 5 and f 0 24 which is not the same case for maximum shear stress for shaft of guide vane 4 2 unsteady results fig 13 shows the drag lift moment and input power coefficient against time with different β in a rotating periodic at θ 0 75 and f 0 08 firstly maximum instantaneous value of drag lift and moment coefficient is increased with β rising up i e approaching a trapezoidal wave so it is shown that the maximum instantaneous value of drag lift and moment as well as input power coefficient are all achieved at β 2 5 secondly we can see that the maximum lift coefficient is achieved at near zero attacking angle which is corresponding to the minimum drag coefficient moreover there is a peak of moment and input power coefficient which is also corresponding to a large ratio of lift to drag finally for β 1 the magnitude of the lift force has a peak twice in each cycle however as β increases the time history of lift force changes its shape from sinusoidal like to trapezoidal like with two peaks appearing instead of a single peak the peak value has also been increased which appears earlier than the single peak fig 14 shows the drag lift moment and input power coefficient against time with different f in a rotating periodic at θ 0 75 and β 2 5 firstly maximum instantaneous value of drag lift moment and input power coefficient are all upward with f going up at β 2 5 it is shown that the peak of instantaneous value of drag and lift are all achieved at nearly t t 0 025 and t t 0 525 namely corresponding the attack angle is at θ 2 3 however from fig 14a b it is shown that the pitch frequency is largely influence on the ratio of lift to drag against time which leads to the sharp changes of moment and input power coefficient namely with the pitch frequency rising the input power is largely nonlinear rising up for example the ratio of maximum input power with f 0 20 to that with f 0 16 is 2 78 furthermore the ratio of maximum input power with f 0 24 to that with f 0 16 is 3 95 from figs 13d and 14d we also notice that the pitch frequency have a larger influence on the input power comparing to the β in fact fig 12 also displays the same conclusion fig 15 show the drag lift moment and input power coefficient against time with θ 0 in a rotating periodic at f 0 08 and β 2 5 firstly it can be seen that drag coefficient increases and lift coefficient decreases with the θ 0 rising up at the same time when f 0 08 and β 2 5 which means that the ratio of lift to drag is down with θ 0 rising up it is also shown that the peak of instantaneous value of drag and lift are all achieved at a same attack angle to different θ 0 moreover it can be seen that the maximum pitching amplitude θ 0 has a little influence on moment and input power coefficient from fig 14c d 4 3 vorticity to develop an understanding of the physical mechanism of the effect of variation of β in fig 16 we show the vorticity contours at five instants between t 0t and t 0 2t during which the lift and drag force dramatically changes as shown in fig 13 firstly at t 0 the leading edge vortex lev has traveled to the trailing edge of the foil for β 1 0 but is still attached to the foil while for β 1 5 it has separated from the foil indicating different timings of vortex shedding with variety β moreover the vortex separates more quickly when β is more large which is suggested that the inverse pressure gradient increased along the upper surface of the foil with the β rising these phonemes contribute to the larger attack angle with the β rising at the same time from fig 8 it is also noticed that there is a small leading vortex formed at t 0t and then travels downstream along the upper surface of the foil in the time interval of t 0 0 1t due to the rotating of foil the lev maybe secondly attach the upper surface of foil moreover the reattaching position and time is largely different for example it is attachment of the lev for β 1 0 at t 0 05t however it isn t reattached for β 1 5 at t 0 05t and lev has a chance to reattach the tail of the upper surface of foil for β 2 at t 0 05t but the behavior has not occur until t 0 1t for β 2 5 this good attachment of the flow during this time interval is due to the so called stall delay we also notice that the lift forces behave differently against effective angle of attacks for different β this may be caused by the kramer effect and it relates to the leading edge vortex we further notice that during t 0t 0 1 t the flow is attached well to lower surfaces of the foil indicating the retaining of the lift force at a high level in this time interval while for t 0 1t 0 2t a leading vortex is forming below the foil the corresponding forces thereby drop rapidly because actual stall maybe happens we furtherly note that the leading edge vortex attached to the lower surface of the foil when traveling along the surface can somewhat keep the lift force at a high level such as the case for t 0 2t for β 1 0 however if the lev attached to the lower surface of the foil separated earlier the benefit gained from the leading edge vortex has been degraded with β increasing which is shown a lower lift when β increasing the different vortex evolutions for various β remind us that the flow around a flapping foil is complicated and strongly related to unsteady hydrodynamics the low of this energy dissipate system by applying sinusoidal pitching is achieved by tuning the flow to an appropriate forming of the leading vortex and a good timing of its shedding from the foil to better understanding of the physical mechanism of the effect of variation of f in fig 14 the vortices contours at five instants between t 0t and t 0 2t are also shown in fig 17 it is found that the lev along the upper surface of the foil occurs at t 0t while observed that the increasing of f leads to the lev occurs later as the lev evolves along the foil upper surface a region with low pressure is generated thus resulting in a high lift coefficient we also notice that the lev can all reattach the upper surface at t 0 05t except f 0 08 case plotted in fig 16 moreover the reattaching position is more near to the leading edge of foil when the rotation of foil is more fast the lev and the corresponding lower pressure region will be located on the upper surface which suggested that there is a larger lift as the same showing in fig 11 we furtherly note that lev attached to the lower surface is separated later with f increasing which is also helpful to maintain the high pressure on the lower surface and showing a higher lift as the lev evolves along the foil upper surface it is also shown that there is two vortex reattach the upper surface at f 0 16 and t 0 1t which means two local low pressure regions are generated can somewhat keep the lift force fluctuation due to the pressure wave movement along the surface of foil 5 conclusions in this paper we have studied the effects of non sinusoidal pitching motion on the hydrodynamic load and power input performance by a full active pitching foil the incompressible navier stokes equations are solved using a finite different method based on fractional time step method with ib method both sinusoidal and trapezoidal pitching profiles are investigated first effects of non sinusoidal pitching motion on the hydrodynamic load and power input performance are investigated for different pitching motions the statistical results of drag lift moment and input power coefficient show well regular for β 2 for instance the time averaged input power coefficient always increased with f rising up or θ 0 decreasing and it is slightly upward with β enlarging we also investigated that the maximum shear stress to shaft of guide vane will be achieved at θ 0 75 β 2 5 and f 0 24 and the maximum time averaged input power is achieved at θ 0 50 β 2 5 and f 0 24 second the drag lift moment and input power coefficient against time with different β θ 0 and f in a rotating periodic have been also investigated it has found that the pitch frequency has a larger influence on the maximum input power comparing to the β and the effect of θ 0 on it is slight finally we also investigated the instantaneously flowing behavior of time history around hydrofoil under different motional parameters to better understand the physical mechanism of the effect of variation of β and f the hydrodynamic load and power input performance relate with the lev evolves along the upper and lower surface of foil these results are helpful to deeply understand the changing discipline well and know how to use it property under different cases the current study reminds us that it might be more appropriate to focus on the optimal operating parameters in a more extended parameter range which would give us a comprehensive figure to design the control improvement strategies however we note the trapezoidal like pitching profile adopted in this paper can only represent one kind of many non sinusoidal pitching strategies and other non sinusoidal pitching profiles such as combining in line motion are still worth further investigating also the further studies considering fluid structure interaction and more high flowing reynolds number as well as cavity are deserved in the future acknowledgements the work described in this paper is funded by the research

23750,fluid structure investigations in hydraulic machines using coupled simulations based on dynamical re mesh are particularly time consuming this paper presents an implementation of an immersed boundary ib method for dynamical boundary flowing problem in a flow solver based on the fractional time step method and the finite different method which is validated by a basic numerical example the hydrofoil which is surrounded by incompressible flow is modeled with forced pitching motions to seek better understanding of the coupled hydrodynamic performance of an oscillating fully active hydrofoil a forced motion of non sinusoidal oscillating is investigated for different pitching frequencies f and maximum angle amplitude θ 0 as well as profile parameter β effects of non sinusoidal pitching motion on the hydrodynamic load and power input performance are investigated under different pitching motional parameters the results show that the time averaged input power gradually increases with both the pitching frequency f and profile parameter β while it decreases with the maximum pitching amplitudeθ 0 the instantaneous peak value of input power also increases with both the pitching frequency f and profile parameter β rising up in addition the flow fields for different motional parameters are discussed the different vortex evolutions for various β and pitching frequency remind us that the flow around a flapping foil is complicated and strongly related to the unsteady hydrodynamics the present research results are helpful to control strategy design for the hydrofoil movement in the operating process of turbine unit keywords hydrofoil hydrodynamic performance non sinusoidal oscillating profile immersed boundary method power input 1 introduction fluid structure interactions play a significant role in many engineering applications design and control especially in hydraulic machinery for instance marine and hydrokinetic devices for capturing energy from waves tides and currents in oceans rivers and streams are at the developing stage but have significant potential to contribute to the future supply of renewable clean energy and a pump turbine often need to transfer between the pump case and turbine case with the operation of a hydrofoil or guide vane a rotor stator interaction will induce pressure fluctuations in the turbine passage which can lead to vibration of the guide vane blade or resonance in the distributor channels zobeiri et al 2006 nicolet et al 2006 the vortex shedding and pressure fluctuations can also induce the runner blade vibration and fracture wang et al 2010a b zhang et al 2009 the flow induced vibrations of the guide vane excited by a periodic vortex shedding ausoni et al 2007 can also lead to premature cracks furthermore transient processes in hydraulic turbines are transitions from one operating point to another controlled by the rotation of a hydrofoil or guide vane as well as valves or wicket gates opening upstream the application of a payload to the generator or other means examples of such processes are power increase decrease runaway and emergency turbine shutdown the majority pass far from the best efficiency point in areas of unstable operation where strong unsteadiness of the flow is observed wang et al 2009 cherny et al 2010 li et al 2010 moreover most of the transient processes are associated with significant discharge changes causing water hammer waves that travel back and forth through the whole water system furthermore vortices shed around the rotating guide vane may enter into the runner blade passage and often induces strong vibration of the unit gorla et al 2005 jiang et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 wang et al 2009 these characteristics of transient processes make the task of simulating them rather complex thus there is strong interest to study the forced oscillating behavior of hydrofoil or guide vane to design safe and reliable turbines or pump turbines in recent years many studies are mainly concentrated in the fully active flapping foils the role of a number of parameters is investigated including foil kinematics foil and system geometry as well as flow physics effects young et al 2014 kinsey and dumas 2008 investigated the power generation capability of a single naca0015 foil with a viscous navier stokes flow solver and their subsequent work has become a de facto standard against which to validate the performance of numerical codes in the power generation problem campobasso and drofelnik 2012a b yu and wang 2013 le et al 2013 tian et al 2014a b 2015 wu et al 2015a b c wu et al 2015a b c wu et al 2014 2015 found that the power extraction performance could be improved by placing the foil near a wall on sinusoidal oscillating motions have also been introduced to enhance the efficiency of energy harvesting system xiao et al 2012 adopted a trapezoidal like pitching profile by varying the key parameter which controls the shape of the pitching profile they found an optimal profile which was proved to dramatically increase the power output and energy harvesting efficiency over a wide range of strouhal numbers ashraf et al 2011 reported that 15 enhancement of efficiency could be achieved by adopting non sinusoidal pitch plunge motions a comparison between the effects of different non sinusoidal motions was carried out by lu et al 2014 according to the numerical simulations by xie et al 2014 they believed that relatively high flapping frequency and large pitching amplitude should be chosen for the best energy harvesting performance platzer et al 2009 also indicated that the feasibility of efficiency enhancement by non sinusoidal motions at different operation parameters had not been well investigated munch et al 2010 presented an alternative method that linearizes the hydrodynamic load of a rigid oscillating hydrofoil the hydrofoil which is modeled with forced and free pitching motions where the mean incidence angle is 0 with a maximum angle amplitude of 2 though all studies reviewed above focused on fully active flapping foils their efforts indicate a possibility of increasing the operating efficiency of a foil by adopting non sinusoidal pitching motions however we note that none of these studies has covered the true movement parametric range for a forced movement of hydrofoil or guide vane of turbine therefore clarification on this issue is required by investigating the input power and hydrodynamic behaviors adopting a wider parameter range and more movement mode furthermore the effects of energy input and hydrodynamic performance under sinusoidal motions are less investigated for different pitching motions for the hydrofoil or guide vane movement of the hydro turbine simultaneously we also notice that the flowing mechanism around hydrofoil is closely interrelated to the flow reynolds number in this paper an intermediate reynolds number at experimental condition in lab is selected although it is largely lower than that of the prototype hydraulic machines these basic regular flowing patterns in low reynolds number is also deserved to study coupled simulations for complex geometries like hydraulic machines are extremely time consuming using either the classical or integrated method based on the re meshing technology the traditional method is straightforward domain time discretizations with accurate and efficient numerical algorithm and good results are usually achieved for flows involving stationary boundaries and simple geometries in fact industrially relevant flows usually involve moving boundaries and complex geometries where the computation becomes more computationally expensive and less efficient and even failure due to the complexities of the geometries in addition traditional body fitted methods usually need tedious grid generation from the solid boundary these arguments support the common statement that the adequate treatment of complex geometric configurations is one of the main obstacles for the application of cfd as a standard design tool in industry therefore great effort has been made to develop adaptive fixed mesh technologies in the last two decades one of them is the immersed boundary ib method therefore in this paper an implicit direct forcing ib method based on the fixed mesh is proposed to simulation for a rigid oscillating hydrofoil or guide vane in the ib method the solid part can act as an elastic body or a rigid body traditionally the ib approaches for complex flows involving moving boundaries and complex geometries can be divided into two main categories the feedback forcing approach and the direct forcing approach the feedback forcing ib approach developed by goldstein et al 1993 determines the singular body force using the differences of velocity and displacement between the ib calculated values and the physical ones on the ib points with two empirical constants although this feedback forcing approach has proved successful for simulating flows past both stationary and moving cylinders le et al 2009 the empirical constants are arbitrary and vary for different flows in addition this method suffers from the instability caused by the inherent feedback nature of the method to overcome this difficulty the direct forcing ib approach was introduced fadlun et al 2000 vikhansky 2003 chiu et al 2010 tian et al 2014a b in this approach the body force is directly deduced from the momentum equation by setting the velocity at ib points to the desired velocity using interpolation distribution functions in this manner the boundary conditions are satisfied on the ib points the direct forcing ib method has been used successfully by many researchers in a variety of applications for example wu and shu 2009 developed a correction method for the velocity on the cartesian grids near the immersed boundary directly to the boundary conditions on the fluid solid interface instead of using the interpolation distribution functions this method is simple robust and easy of implementation which were demonstrated by simulating several benchmark problems based on the idea of ref wu and shu 2009 ren et al 2012 used boundary condition enforced immersed boundary method for thermal flow problems with the dirichlet temperature condition easy implementation and robustness in stability were reported in this paper a direct forcing ib method solver for flow a forced motion of a guide vane of turbine is simulated the rest of this paper is organized as follows the governing equations and its relation to the ib method will be introduced in section 2 1 and the velocity correction and space discretization are simply described in section 2 2 and section 2 3 respectively then the validity of the numerical method is shown in section 2 4 the case study and describes is introduced in section 3 the numerical simulations results of the non sinusoidal forced oscillating of guide vane are then discussed in section 4 finally the paper is concluded by closing remarks in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations the influence of the immersed boundary on the fluid is often represented by forces exerted on the fluid to impose the no slip condition at the immersed boundary therefore the governing equations of this fluid structure interaction system are the usual incompressible navier stokes equations the conservative form of the second order adams bashforth temporal discretized governing equations of incompressible fluid flow using the ib method are 1 u n 1 0 and 2 u n 1 u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 3 2 p n 1 2 p n 1 f n 1 2 δ t where u and p are respectively the velocity and pressure δ t is time step the superscript n represents nth time step r s h u u ν u u t comprised of the convection and diffusive terms and f represents the boundary body force density ν is the kinetic viscosity here we introduce two functions c ϕ and d φ which represent the interpolation and distribution functions respectively note that the distribution function maps the physical field from the ib points to the cartesian grids on the other hand the interpolation function projects the physical field from the cartesian grids back to the ib points the lower case ϕ represents the variables on the cartesian mesh x j such as u p f etc and the upper case φ indicates the variables on the ib points x i e g u f etc suppose that the immersed boundary is represented by a set of ib points x i i 1 2 m and the fluid field is discretized by a fixed uniform cartesian mesh x j j 1 2 n with mesh spacing δ x δ y h furthermore the variable φ x i on the ib points can be calculated as 3 φ x i c ϕ x i j δ j i ϕ x j h 2 j 1 2 n i 1 2 m where the discrete delta function adopted is those suggested by peskin 2002 i e 4 δ j i δ x i x j 1 h 2 φ x i x j h φ y i y j h where φ r can be written as 5 φ r 1 8 3 2 r 1 4 r 4 r 2 0 r 1 1 8 5 2 r 7 12 r 4 r 2 1 r 2 0 2 r the same way the variable ϕ x j on the cartesian grids can be calculated as 6 ϕ x j d φ x j i δ i j φ x i h 2 j 1 2 n i 1 2 m the purpose of ib method is to set the boundary conditions on the immersed boundary exactly namely satisfies the no slip and no penetration conditions for a viscous fluid the velocity at the ib point interpolated from the corrected fluid velocity field via the smooth delta function δ i j must be equal to the boundary physical velocity v n 1 at the same position this can be expressed as 7 u n 1 v n 1 where 8 u n 1 c u n 1 substituting the discretized momentum equation eq 2 and eq 8 into eq 7 gives 9 v n 1 u n 1 c u n 1 c u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 3 2 p n 1 2 p n 1 c f n 1 2 δ t we noted that f n 1 2 δ t c f n 1 2 δ t in which f n 1 2 represents the boundary body force density on the ib points then we distribute this body force f n 1 2 to the cartesian grids as 10 d f n 1 2 δ t d c f n 1 2 δ t d v n 1 c u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 3 2 p n 1 2 p n 1 this body force on the cartesian grids is finally defined as 11 f n 1 2 δ t d v n 1 c u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 3 2 p n 1 2 p n 1 2 2 velocity correction with the help of classical fractional step technique the velocity field can be obtained in the following predictor corrector steps 2 2 1 prediction step start with the normal navier stokes equations without the forcing term calculate the intermediate velocity u n 12 u n u n δ t 3 2 r s h n 1 2 r s h n 1 1 2 p n 1 then the immediate velocity u n is corrected to the predicted velocity u n by the following form 13 u n u n δ t 3 2 p n before the use of eq 13 the pressure field should be obtained first by solving the following poisson equation which is derived from satisfying of continuity equation by u n 14 2 p n 2 3 δ t u n once the pressure field is known which can be substituted into eq 11 the forcing term f n 1 2 can be obtained in the specific implementation process a staggered grid is used for the finite difference discretization of eq 12 that is scalar variable like pressure is defined at the center of each cell while velocity components are defined at the cell faces 2 2 2 corrector step the corrected velocity field can be obtained by solving the following equation with the forcing term f n 1 2 15 u n 1 u n δ t f n 1 2 in this velocity correction method the body force is not pre calculated but implicitly determined in such a way that the velocity at the immersed boundary interpolated from the corrected velocity field accurately satisfies the no slip and no penetration conditions in our paper we use the implicit velocity correction method combined finite different discretized method to simulate fluid flow 2 3 space discretization we assume that φ is the fluid variable on the interior cartesian node the convective term such as ϕ ϕ x etc can be discretized as 16 ϕ ϕ x ϕ i j 2 δ x ϕ i 1 j ϕ i 1 j ϕ c f δ x ϕ i 1 j 3 ϕ i j 3 ϕ i 1 j ϕ i 2 j ϕ c f δ x ϕ i 2 j 3 ϕ i 1 j 3 ϕ i j ϕ i 1 j where φ 1 2 φ i j φ i j φ 1 2 φ i j φ i j c f 0 125 to diffusive terms such as 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 etc can be discretized as 17 2 φ x 2 φ i 1 j 2 φ i j φ i 1 j δ x 2 2 φ y 2 φ i j 1 2 φ i j φ i j 1 δ y 2 the pressure poisson equation can be discretized as 18 p i 1 j 2 p i j p i 1 j δ x 2 p i j 1 2 p i j p i j 1 δ y 2 2 3 δ t u i 1 j u i 1 j 2 δ x v i j 1 v i j 1 2 δ y to the boundary cartesian nodes the upwind discretization is used such as to the left boundary i 0 diffusive terms can be expressed as 19 2 φ x 2 φ i j 2 φ i 1 j φ i 2 j δ x 2 φ 0 j 2 φ 1 j φ 2 j δ x 2 and the right term of pressure

simulated to verify that the present immersed boundary method predicts flow phenomena such as separation and vortex shedding very well the size of the computational domain is 15d 10d where d denotes the diameter of the cylinder which is shown in fig 1 computations are performed for re 200 based on the free stream velocity u and the diameter with the maximum cfl number of 0 8 the numbers of uniform grid points are 600 400 in the streamwise x and transverse y directions respectively and 126 grid points in each direction are uniformly distributed within the cylinder diameter a dirichlet boundary condition u u v 0 is used at the inflow and far field boundaries and a convective boundary condition u x v x 0 is used for the outflow boundary computations are performed at three different rotating velocities of the cylinder namely ω 0 5 ω 1 and ω 2 0 the time step is δ t 2 10 3 prior to t 160 the cylinder is static afterwards the cylinder is uniformly rotating here all physical quantities are non dimensional by the length scale d and time scale d u once the velocity field and pressure fields have been computed the drag and lift coefficients and the strouhal number can be computed from the force at the control points in table 1 the drag and lift coefficients as well as the strouhal number at re 200 for the static cylinder case are compared to other numerical simulations for the static cylinder case the mean drag obtained by our algorithm is in good agreement with those computed by other researchers liu et al 1998 calhoun 2002 russell and wang 2003 le et al 2006 and slightly lower than experimental data schliching and gersten 2000 only by 3 6 the lift coefficient calculated by our method for re 200 is near to the values obtained by other researchers and our strouhal numbers are in good agreement with those given in refs liu et al 1998 calhoun 2002 russell and wang 2003 le et al 2006 for the rotating cylinder case the mean drag and lift coefficients are lower than those of the static cylinder however the amplitude of the lift coefficient is larger it is also seen that the mean drag coefficient decreases and the amplitude of the lift coefficient increases together with the rotating angular velocity increasing the strouhal number however remains mostly the same through variation of the rotating angular velocity fig 2 show the variations in time for the drag and lift coefficients these figures depict the development of the vortex shedding into a periodic state with time at re 200 it can be seen that the two minimum values are obtained in the periods under the ω 0 5 and ω 1 0 cases and contribute to the second vortex of the rotating cylinder fig 3 shows the evolution of the streamline in time the characteristics of the startup flow at this reynolds number and rotating velocity consist of a primary eddy evolving at the top of the cylinder and a second eddy developing below the x axis of symmetry fig 3a d the second eddy moves upward fig 3c and d inducing two secondary vortices fig 3f which merge to form a single vortex at time t t fig 3h the stream function contours obtained by the current study are in remarkable agreement with experimental observations coutanceau and menard 1985 and previous computational results badr and dennis 1985 to further valid our numerical method flow over a two dimensional flat plate at different large amplitude pitch up hold pitch down maneuver cases is simulated compared to the high fidelity direct numerical simulating results by brunton et al 2013 the length of flat plate is l with the thickness of 0 01 l the size of the computational domain is 10l 6l the coordinate origin point lies in the left down corner and the centre of the flat plate is in 3l 3l the flowing reynolds numbers are equal to 100 and 300 respectively based on the free stream velocity u and the length of flat plate a dirichlet boundary condition u u v 0 is used at the inflow and far field boundaries and a convective boundary condition u x v x 0 is used for the outflow boundary computations are performed at the numbers of uniform grid points is 1 000 600 in the streamwise x and transverse y directions and 202 grid points are uniformly distributed along the surface of the flat plate the time step is δ t 2 10 3 a large amplitude pitch up hold pitch down manoeuvre developed by eldredge et al 2009 to study separation phenomena in pitching aerofoils is given by the following 21 α t α 0 α m a x g t max g t g t log cosh a t t 1 cosh a t t 4 cosh a t t 2 cosh a t t 3 the manoeuvre from 21 is also used by brunton et al 2013 and the present study where α 0 is the initial angle of attack α m a x is the amplitude of pitch the parameter a 11 determines how sharp the corners are in the manoeuvre and t 1 1 t 2 3 t 3 4 t 4 6 where t is a is non dimensional time using the length of flat plate l and the free stream velocity u three cases are studied namely case 1 α 0 0 α m a x 32 re 300 and the pitch point is mid chord point and does not pitch back down to α 0 case 2 α 0 10 α m a x 15 re 100 and the pitch point is the leading edge case 3 α 0 0 α m a x 45 re 100 and the pitch point is the leading edge to valid the grid independent for case 1 three different grid scales finest middle coarse are used namely the numbers of uniform grid points are 1 500 900 1 000 600 500 300 in the streamwise x and transverse y directions respectively the intel xeon cpu 3 30ghz is used the computational time for each time step for finest middle and coarse grid are 58 534s 25 757s and 11 443s respectively fig 4 shows the variations in time for the drag and lift coefficients for case 1 at finest middle and coarse grid respectively these figures depict the development of the vortex shedding into a periodic state with time when the flat plate holding a static angle α 32 on three different meshes the results show average lift coefficients calculated by the coarse medium and fine mesh are 1 185 1 156 and 1 128 respectively and average drag coefficients are 0 927 0 918 and 0 910 respectively the difference of average lift coefficients between the medium mesh and the fine mesh is less than 3 and the difference of average lift coefficients between the medium mesh and the fine mesh is only 0 8 therefore we adopt the medium mesh of 1 000 600 in the following simulations it is also seen that the amplitude of lift and drag coefficients by brunton et al 2013 is little higher than our present results the comparison of present computational results for case 2 with dns results brunton et al 2013 is shown in fig 5 we can see that the present lift coefficient matches the dns very closely although there are some different to predict the local peak value at the sharp transferring times among the pitch up hold and pitch down stages it is also shown the vorticity distribution at different time in a steady oscillating period which is similar to dns results brunton et al 2013 it is important to predict the lift coefficient at large amplitude manoeuvres with significant flow separation for this reason we consider a number of large amplitude pitch manoeuvres and investigate the predicting performance case 3 for the pitch up hold pitch down manoeuvre from 0 to 45 and back down given by eq 21 and shown in fig 6 it is also seen that the changing trend of lift coefficient with time does surprisingly well with the dns results brunton et al 2013 considering the large separated flow structures although there is a little difference during each phase of the manoeuvre 3 set up the hydrofoil used in the numerical cases is a guide vane of a test hydro turbine model a two dimensional foil is shown in fig 7 the chord length of the foil is a the maximum thick of the hydrofoil h 0 179a the relative camber of the hydrofoil is 0 019 the pivoting point is located at the center line of the foil with a distance b 0 466 a from the leading edge the upstream flow

400 in the streamwise x and transverse y directions respectively and 101 grid points are uniformly distributed along the hydrofoil curve surface line a dirichlet boundary condition u u v 0 is used at the inflow and far field boundaries and a convective boundary condition u x v x 0 is used for the outflow boundary for the forced motion case as seen in fig 8 the instantaneous angle of attack is denoted by θ and is expressed as 22 θ θ 0 sin β ω t 0 t π 2 β ω θ 0 π 2 β ω t π 2 ω 2 1 β θ 0 sin β ω t π 1 β π 2 ω 2 1 β t π 2 ω 2 1 β θ 0 π 2 ω 2 1 β t π 2 ω 4 1 β θ 0 sin β ω t 2 π 1 β π 2 ω 4 1 β t 2 π ω where θ 0 is the pitching amplitude the angular flapping frequency ω 2 π f it is noted that when β 1 the foil pitches sinusoidally while the pitching profile tends to be trapezoidal as β in fig 8 we plot the time variation of the pitching profile θ t for some typical values of β there is a gradual change from a sinusoid to a square wave as β increases from one dimensionless coefficients for lift drag moment and power input are defined as respectively the drag coefficient is defined as 23 c d t f d t 1 2 ρ u 2 a c where ρ is the fluid density c is the unit foil span here for two

where r is the vector from pivoting point to the foil boundary the instantaneous coefficient of power input 29 c p t p t 1 2 ρ u 3 a where the instantaneous power input actuating the pitching motion

the time averaged drag coefficient with different pitch frequency f maximum pitching amplitude θ 0 and profile parameter β it is investigated that the time averaged drag coefficient is firstly escalation to a maximum then to decreased with f rising up at a same θ 0 when β 2 but it is abnormal when β 2 5 where the time averaged drag coefficient is sharply increased with the pitch frequency rising when the θ 0 70 which is relation with the vortex involve along the foil surface which is shown later also we can see that the time averaged drag coefficient always increased with the rising of θ 0 at a same f and β simultaneously which is also increased with the β rising at a same f and θ 0 we also notice that the time averaged drag coefficients are all positive under our present pitching parameters fig 10 is the time averaged lift coefficient with f θ 0 and β it can be seen that the time averaged lift coefficient has a slight increase in positive y direction then rapidly go down and change direction continuously keep to an upward trend in negative y direction till up to a peak value with f rising up however it is abnormal when θ 0 65 and β 2 5 also it is shown that the maximum of time average lift coefficient of each case is always variety for different β for example the maximum of time average lift coefficient is achieved at θ 0 65 for β 1 0 however which is achieved at θ 0 50 for β 2 0 in fact these differences also suggested that the complexity of flowing structure under different movement parameters such as the leading and tailing edge vortex forming and evolving as the engineering attention form the figs 9 and 10 it is concluded that the maximum shear stress to shaft of guide vane will be achieved at θ 0 75 β 2 5 and f 0 24 which is helpful to deeply understand the changing trend well and know how to use it property under different operating cases fig 11 plots the time averaged moment coefficient with d f θ 0 and β it can be seen that time averaged moment coefficient in most cases have changed the direction first it is clockwise direction positive when the pitch frequency is low then is counter clockwise negative and gradually increase with f rising up which means that more rapid of foil rotating larger input torque is required it is also can be seen that the maximum time averaged moment is achieved at θ 0 65 β 1 5 and f 1 5 case fig 12 is the time averaged input power coefficient with f θ 0 and β it is investigated that the time averaged input power coefficient shows excellent regular chance versus β which is always increasing with f rising up at the same θ 0 and β these results are also agreement with the refs lu et al 2014 teng et al 2016 these figures also show that the time averaged input power coefficient will become less when θ 0 is larger at a same pitch frequency from these figures we can conclude that more input power is required when θ 0 is more little and more rapid of pitching it is to be worth mentioning that the maximum time averaged input power is achieved at θ 0 50 β 2 5 and f 0 24 which is not the same case for maximum shear stress for shaft of guide vane 4 2 unsteady results fig 13 shows the drag lift moment and input power coefficient against time with different β in a rotating periodic at θ 0 75 and f 0 08 firstly maximum instantaneous value of drag lift and moment coefficient is increased with β rising up i e approaching a trapezoidal wave so it is shown that the maximum instantaneous value of drag lift and moment as well as input power coefficient are all achieved at β 2 5 secondly we can see that the maximum lift coefficient is achieved at near zero attacking angle which is corresponding to the minimum drag coefficient moreover there is a peak of moment and input power coefficient which is also corresponding to a large ratio of lift to drag finally for β 1 the magnitude of the lift force has a peak twice in each cycle however as β increases the time history of lift force changes its shape from sinusoidal like to trapezoidal like with two peaks appearing instead of a single peak the peak value has also been increased which appears earlier than the single peak fig 14 shows the drag lift moment and input power coefficient against time with different f in a rotating periodic at θ 0 75 and β 2 5 firstly maximum instantaneous value of drag lift moment and input power coefficient are all upward with f going up at β 2 5 it is shown that the peak of instantaneous value of drag and lift are all achieved at nearly t t 0 025 and t t 0 525 namely corresponding the attack angle is at θ 2 3 however from fig 14a b it is shown that the pitch frequency is largely influence on the ratio of lift to drag against time which leads to the sharp changes of moment and input power coefficient namely with the pitch frequency rising the input power is largely nonlinear rising up for example the ratio of maximum input power with f 0 20 to that with f 0 16 is 2 78 furthermore the ratio of maximum input power with f 0 24 to that with f 0 16 is 3 95 from figs 13d and 14d we also notice that the pitch frequency have a larger influence on the input power comparing to the β in fact fig 12 also displays the same conclusion fig 15 show the drag lift moment and input power coefficient against time with θ 0 in a rotating periodic at f 0 08 and β 2 5 firstly it can be seen that drag coefficient increases and lift coefficient decreases with the θ 0 rising up at the same time when f 0 08 and β 2 5 which means that the ratio of lift to drag is down with θ 0 rising up it is also shown that the peak of instantaneous value of drag and lift are all achieved at a same attack angle to different θ 0 moreover it can be seen that the maximum pitching amplitude θ 0 has a little influence on moment and input power coefficient from fig 14c d 4 3 vorticity to develop an understanding of the physical mechanism of the effect of variation of β in fig 16 we show the vorticity contours at five instants between t 0t and t 0 2t during which the lift and drag force dramatically changes as shown in fig 13 firstly at t 0 the leading edge vortex lev has traveled to the trailing edge of the foil for β 1 0 but is still attached to the foil while for β 1 5 it has separated from the foil indicating different timings of vortex shedding with variety β moreover the vortex separates more quickly when β is more large which is suggested that the inverse pressure gradient increased along the upper surface of the foil with the β rising these phonemes contribute to the larger attack angle with the β rising at the same time from fig 8 it is also noticed that there is a small leading vortex formed at t 0t and then travels downstream along the upper surface of the foil in the time interval of t 0 0 1t due to the rotating of foil the lev maybe secondly attach the upper surface of foil moreover the reattaching position and time is largely different for example it is attachment of the lev for β 1 0 at t 0 05t however it isn t reattached for β 1 5 at t 0 05t and lev has a chance to reattach the tail of the upper surface of foil for β 2 at t 0 05t but the behavior has not occur until t 0 1t for β 2 5 this good attachment of the flow during this time interval is due to the so called stall delay we also notice that the lift forces behave differently against effective angle of attacks for different β this may be caused by the kramer effect and it relates to the leading edge vortex we further notice that during t 0t 0 1 t the flow is attached well to lower surfaces of the foil indicating the retaining of the lift force at a high level in this time interval while for t 0 1t 0 2t a leading vortex is forming below the foil the corresponding forces thereby drop rapidly because actual stall maybe happens we furtherly note that the leading edge vortex attached to the lower surface of the foil when traveling along the surface can somewhat keep the lift force at a high level such as the case for t 0 2t for β 1 0 however if the lev attached to the lower surface of the foil separated earlier the benefit gained from the leading edge vortex has been degraded with β increasing which is shown a lower lift when β increasing the different vortex evolutions for various β remind us that the flow around a flapping foil is complicated and strongly related to unsteady hydrodynamics the low of this energy dissipate system by applying sinusoidal pitching is achieved by tuning the flow to an appropriate forming of the leading vortex and a good timing of its shedding from the foil to better understanding of the physical mechanism of the effect of variation of f in fig 14 the vortices contours at five instants between t 0t and t 0 2t are also shown in fig 17 it is found that the lev along the upper surface of the foil occurs at t 0t while observed that the increasing of f leads to the lev occurs later as the lev evolves along the foil upper surface a region with low pressure is generated thus resulting in a high lift coefficient we also notice that the lev can all reattach the upper surface at t 0 05t except f 0 08 case plotted in fig 16 moreover the reattaching position is more near to the leading edge of foil when the rotation of foil is more fast the lev and the corresponding lower pressure region will be located on the upper surface which suggested that there is a larger lift as the same showing in fig 11 we furtherly note that lev attached to the lower surface is separated later with f increasing which is also helpful to maintain the high pressure on the lower surface and showing a higher lift as the lev evolves along the foil upper surface it is also shown that there is two vortex reattach the upper surface at f 0 16 and t 0 1t which means two local low pressure regions are generated can somewhat keep the lift force fluctuation due to the pressure wave movement along the surface of foil 5 conclusions in this paper we have studied the effects of non sinusoidal pitching motion on the hydrodynamic load and power input performance by a full active pitching foil the incompressible navier stokes equations are solved using a finite different method based on fractional time step method with ib method both sinusoidal and trapezoidal pitching profiles are investigated first effects of non sinusoidal pitching motion on the hydrodynamic load and power input performance are investigated for different pitching motions the statistical results of drag lift moment and input power coefficient show well regular for β 2 for instance the time averaged input power coefficient always increased with f rising up or θ 0 decreasing and it is slightly upward with β enlarging we also investigated that the maximum shear stress to shaft of guide vane will be achieved at θ 0 75 β 2 5 and f 0 24 and the maximum time averaged input power is achieved at θ 0 50 β 2 5 and f 0 24 second the drag lift moment and input power coefficient against time with different β θ 0 and f in a rotating periodic have been also investigated it has found that the pitch frequency has a larger influence on the maximum input power comparing to the β and the effect of θ 0 on it is slight finally we also investigated the instantaneously flowing behavior of time history around hydrofoil under different motional parameters to better understand the physical mechanism of the effect of variation of β and f the hydrodynamic load and power input performance relate with the lev evolves along the upper and lower surface of foil these results are helpful to deeply understand the changing discipline well and know how to use it property under different cases the current study reminds us that it might be more appropriate to focus on the optimal operating parameters in a more extended parameter range which would give us a comprehensive figure to design the control improvement strategies however we note the trapezoidal like pitching profile adopted in this paper can only represent one kind of many non sinusoidal pitching strategies and other non sinusoidal pitching profiles such as combining in line motion are still worth further investigating also the further studies considering fluid structure interaction and more high flowing reynolds number as well as cavity are deserved in the future acknowledgements the work described in this paper is funded by the research

23751,this paper presents the use of a virtual environment for investigating risks associated with human responses in emergency situations on offshore installations the virtual environment and the risk management can be used to analyze risks associated with human responses by investigating the effectiveness of existing safety measures identifying areas of improvement and proposing new designs for safety measures problems dealing with emergency scenarios on offshore installations is a tremendous undertaking the interaction of personnel using the safety measures in emergency situations can be affected by hazards environment conditions malfunctioning equipment and inadequate emergency preparedness such factors have the potential to prevent personnel from arriving at a safe area increase the level of risks and consequently cause injuries or fatalities to personnel risks associated with human responses in emergency scenarios are often unforeseen due to difficulties with modeling realistic emergency scenarios objective the objective of the research is to study demonstrate the use of virtual environments for investigating and managing risks associated with human responses in emergencies method risk management is employed to assess and manage risks associated with human responses in emergency scenarios the risk management is tested using experimental data collected from past studies of human responses in virtual environments results risks associated with human responses during emergency scenarios are determined by safety measures the environment and the egress route choices that have been taught participants performance and interaction with improved safety measures are better than the performance of participants without safety measures conclusion this paper provides a demonstration of the utility of virtual environments to assess risks associated with human responses in emergency situations application the findings of this study may be useful for offshore energy operations keywords emergency situation harsh environment human responses offshore installation risk management 1 introduction the organization or operator of offshore installations should prioritize the emergency response plan and safety barriers for escape in emergency situations safety measures for escape can include an alarm system primary and alternative escape routes muster stations and personal protective equipment e g health and safety executive hse 1997 canadian association of petroleum producers capp 2010 for offshore installations operating in harsh environmental conditions both escape routes and muster stations can be heat traced and fully enclosed to protect individuals when performing escape activities in cold temperatures eikill et al 2007 the organization must ensure that personnel practice emergency drills to familiarize themselves with the equipment and procedures and identify limitations potential hazards and risks in performing escape from hazardous areas the challenges and risks of performing escape depend on an individual s skills and experience teamwork procedures roles and responsibilities communication as well as the emergency response plan environment conditions and reliability of emergency equipment hse 2007 capp 2010a 2010b all of these factors influence the effectiveness of safety barriers the success of escape operations and the safety of individuals should an emergency occur the potential of hazards cannot be eliminated totally emergency situations in the presence of hazards can worsen when personnel fail to interact with emergency equipment and follow procedures consistently the effects of fires explosions and poor environmental conditions can cause failures of both personnel responses and the escape the probability of failure will increase further when escape is performed in adverse weather conditions or harsh environments such as in the presence of ice and snow cold temperatures darkness or strong winds mould 2001 kjellén 2007 there are many studies that have introduced or proposed effective tools and techniques as safety measures in emergency situations on offshore installation dimattia et al 2005 and deacon et al 2010 proposed prevention and mitigation barriers in risk management focusing on personnel performing escape evacuation and rescue eer activities andersen and mostue 2012 presented integrated operations io on risk management approaches using real time data collaborative techniques and multiple expertise in making better decisions and implementations for the norwegian oil and gas industry simulation based studies have been used before to investigate human performance in emergency scenarios doheny and fraser 1996 modelled an individual making decisions in an emergency scenario on offshore installations while considering the offshore facility relatively sparsely populated in a study of individuals behaviours conducted by ha et al 2014 walking direction was determined based on destination obstacles and visibility during emergency scenarios kim et al 2004 integrated both individuals behaviours and a dynamic model in the study of evacuation during marine accidents joo et al 2013 investigated dynamic individual actions interacting with emergent hazards such as fire using an agent based simulation duarte et al 2014 used a virtual environment to investigate dynamic versus static signs on human behaviour during emergency evacuation augustijn beckers et al 2010 studied pre evacuation behaviour and exit choice during emergency scenarios involving a group of individuals using a virtual environment of an offshore installation bradbury squires 2013 assessed efficacy of active and hybrid learning modes on task performance during emergency training smith 2015 and smith et al 2015 studied the effectiveness of simulation training on individual s competency and learning during emergency situations colombo and golzio 2016 introduced a simulation based approach to training teams including operators and managers in making decisions and increasing their competencies as a team in critical situations poor performance or lack of response in emergency situations can result in injuries and fatalities to personnel there is a need to reduce and manage risks associated with personnel performance in emergency situations on offshore installations the objective of the present work is to demonstrate the use of virtual environments for investigating and managing risks associated with human responses in emergencies engineered and procedural safety measures are studied and discussed in this paper see sections 3 1 2 and 3 2 2 the approach uses experimental data of human responses obtained from previous studies that used virtual environments duarte et al 2014 smith 2015 section 2 describes the risk calculation and its formulation section 3 explains experimental studies of human responses using virtual environments sections 4 and 5 present and conclude the risk management study 2 calculation of risks in this paper risk is assessed with regard to the probability of failures only in case studies used here we treat consequences of failure as neutral i e risk is proportional to probability only the probability of failures is calculated by considering the performance score in the emergency scenarios from two experimental studies as further explained in section 3 the performance score is analysed to determine the mean and standard deviation duarte et al 2014 smith 2015 information on mean and standard deviation is used to calculate a probability based on a normal distribution modarres 2006 this paper assumes a normal distribution to simplify the calculations the probability is calculated considering a normal distribution function a normal density function in equation 1 1 f x μ σ 1 2 π σ 2 exp x μ 2 2 σ 2 where x is the passing score μ is the average of overall scores σ is the standard deviation of scores σ2 is the variance in the distribution the next step is to estimate the risks associated with the human responses by comparing two different failure probabilities one is the emergency situation equipped with safety measures and the other is the emergency situation without safety measures the calculation of the change in risk is formulated as shown in equation 2 2 δ risk p r obability without safety measures probability with safety measures confidence intervals are employed to verify the calculation of probabilities and risks kumamoto and henley 1996 equation 3 is a formula for determining confidence interval the sample size mean and standard deviation are used to calculate the confidence interval of the mean the calculation is based on a normal distribution and a 95 percent confidence interval the results are presented in section 4 4 3 c i μ α σ n where α is the desired confidence level and n is the sample size 3 case studies of emergency scenarios in virtual environment data from two published experimental studies of different virtual environments have been selected to provide data for this risk management study the first experimental study entitled the effect of virtual environment training on participant competence and learning in offshore emergency egress scenarios is the source of data on human responses in an emergency scenario on an offshore installation smith 2015 the second experimental study entitled behavioural compliance for dynamic versus static signs in an immersive virtual environment is the source of data on behavioural compliance with signage duarte et al 2014 both experimental studies were conducted using virtual environments ve with the purpose to observe human responses and behaviours during emergency conditions duarte et al 2014 smith 2015 smith et al 2015 simulating emergency conditions in the ve can provide a safe medium for participants to acquire artificial experience which is otherwise impractical and risky to obtain in a real situation details of emergency scenarios in the ve are explained in sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 1 offshore emergency egress scenario on an offshore installation smith 2015 studied the effectiveness of simulation training on individual s competency and learning during emergency situations using the all hands virtual emergency response trainer avert software the layout in avert includes accommodations and a muster station and lifeboat station both located on the main deck three routes were provided as egress routes the primary route characterized as an interior route with an inside stairwell and secondary and tertiary routes characterized as exterior routes with an outside stairwell in the study smith 2015 the simulation scenarios begin with the activation of an emergency alarm general platform alarm that requires all personnel onboard to move to a muster station using one of the designated escape routes in the case of an escalating event an evacuation alarm prepare to abandon platform alarm is triggered to notify personnel to muster directly at the lifeboat station hazards such as blackouts fire and smoke were implemented in avert to create credible emergency scenarios the emergency scenario with the presence of hazards required participants to find a safe route to the muster or lifeboat station by avoiding the escape routes blocked by hazards smith 2015 3 1 1 participants of study in the study conducted by smith 2015 thirty six volunteers participated the participants ages ranged between 19 to 55 years old smith 2015 distributed a video game experience questionnaire to participants prior to dividing them into two groups that were balanced in terms of video game experience in the experiment the amount of practice the participants received differed according to the group participants in group 1 had repeated training participants in group 2 had a single exposure to training smith 2015 smith et al 2015 the 17 participants in group 1 reviewed training tutorials and repeated avert practice scenarios in preparation for the test scenarios the 19 participants in group 2 received the initial tutorial training and no avert practice scenarios 3 1 2 avert emergency response test scenarios of 12 emergency scenarios in the study done by smith 2015 four 4 emergency scenarios in avert were selected for this paper as listed in table 1 the four scenarios provide information related to engineered and procedural safety measures normal emergency lighting is categorized as an engineered safety measure for emergency scenarios emergency response procedures are the procedural measures used in the study these relate to the participants competence to respond to emergency scenarios this paper uses different performance scoring criteria than presented in smith 2015 details of performance scores are described in section 3 1 3 emergency lighting provided in the event of emergency is considered as an engineered safety measure the participants performance is compared to responses during two different emergency scenarios a in a normal lighting condition ta1 and b a blackout scenario ta3 according to smith 2015 wayfinding reflects the participants spatial knowledge of the platform specifically their understanding of the layout and egress routes in this paper the wayfinding is assessed by considering a the route selection primary secondary and tertiary routes b the arrival at the correct muster or lifeboat station and c incorrect deviations along the route the participants performance is compared to responses during two different emergency scenarios which are a in a normal lighting condition ta1 and b a blackout scenario ta3 ii competency of participants smith 2015 defined competence as the demonstration of knowledge related to alarm recognition routes and mapping and hazards avoidance which participants gained in the training tutorials the participants were evaluated based on their performance in recognizing types of alarm re routing and taking the safest routes avoiding hazards on route and arriving at the correct muster or lifeboat station smith 2015 participant s competency is considered as procedural safety this paper uses evaluation of participants competency in two emergency scenarios th1 and th2 as presented in table 1 with escalating events that required them to re route smith 2015 the criteria in the study performed by smith 2015 are selected as a subset for assessing and managing risks associated with human responses table 2 lists the subset criteria according to emergency scenario i equipped with the engineered safety measures and ii required knowledge of procedural safety 3 1 3 score for performance in test scenarios this paper uses a different scoring scheme than that used by smith 2015 because only a subset of smith s criteria are used here performance scores for the test scenarios in ta1 and ta3 are based on route selection and arrival at the correct location according to the type of alarm both ta1 and ta3 have 15 points as the total performance scores see table 3 test scenarios in th1 and th2 have performance scores based on route selection re routing when the route has been blocked hazard avoidance and arrival at the correct location both th1 and th2 have 35 points as the total performance scores 3 1 4 mean and standard deviation of emergency response test scenarios the performance scores are used to calculate mean and standard deviations for each test scenario this is followed by calculating the probability of failure based on the mean and standard deviations considering a normal distribution the probability of failure shows the numbers of actions failed according to the subset criteria in table 3 the probability of failure is shown in the range between 0 and 1 in this paper table 4 presents the mean standard deviation and probability of failure for the test scenarios of ta1 and ta3 the mean standard deviation and probability of failure in test scenarios th1 and th2 are listed in table 5 the mean and standard deviation in tables 4 and 5 are scores out of the total performance scores 3 2 behavioural compliance for dynamic versus static signs in a building evacuation researchers duarte et al 2014 used a virtual environment known as ergovr to investigate dynamic versus static signs on human behaviour during emergency evacuation ergovr simulated a building consisting of four 4 rooms meeting room laboratory cafeteria and warehouse the walls of the rooms and hallway have safety signs and exit signs the experiment required participants to go to every room and look for instructions for the given tasks in the scenario there was an emergency scenario involving an explosion followed by a fire when the participants entered a warehouse the fire alarm was triggered due to the explosion and fire in the ve all corridors except the exit route were affected by the hazard and blocked by flames and smoke the emergency scenario required participants to follow the exit signs in order to safely evacuate the building 3 2 1 participants of study a total of 90 participants consisting of university students were involved in the experimental study thirty 30 participants were assigned to each of the following groups according to the different types of exit signs a a minimal design b in a static configuration and c in a dynamic configuration duarte et al 2014 3 2 2 types of exit signage in the study conducted by duarte et al 2014 available egress routes were marked by exit signs consisting of an arrow and a running figure in a doorway the experiment varied the number of exit signs available and the type of exit signs static and dynamic signs three different types of exit signs are described in table 6 the objective of the study was to investigate human behaviour in complying with exit signs the participants were expected to move toward the exit door following the exit signs in order to evacuate the building safely they were given scores for the performance of safe evacuation duarte et al 2014 3 2 3 scores for behavioural measures the behaviour and performance of participants were assessed according to specific criteria duarte et al 2014 this paper uses complying with exit signage as one criteria to give six 6 points as the total performance score table 7 describes the criteria and scores for participants behavioural compliance in the simulation 3 2 4 mean and standard deviation of behavioural simulation using the results reported by duarte et al 2014 the participants performance scores were calculated to get the values of the mean and standard deviation for each type of exit sign provided in the simulation this was followed by calculating the probability of failure based on the mean and standard deviation assuming a normal distribution the mean standard deviation and probability of failure are listed in table 8 4 risk management of in emergency scenarios sections 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 present the results of data analysis for the following factors wayfinding in normal lighting conditions compared to blackout scenario competency of participants in emergency offshore evacuation and behavioural compliance with exit signs respectively the risk management in emergency scenarios are categorized into i engineered safety measures which are normal lighting and exit signage and ii procedural safety which reflects participants competence the results in sections 4 1 4 3 are supported by confidence intervals in section 4 4 4 1 impact of lighting condition and blackout scenario on wayfinding two scenarios from smith s study 2015 were used to look at the effect of visibility on the risk associated with making wayfinding errors ta1 represents a normal lighting condition ta3 represents a blackout condition the change in risk represents the difference between the probabilities of failure for the blackout and normal lighting scenarios denoted as δriskblackout as indicated in fig 1 the risk is 0 04 the risk of making wayfinding errors is high due to the difference between participants route selection in the two scenarios participants showed a tendency to select the primary route in normal lighting conditions however during the blackout scenario participants seemed to use any of the available routes i e primary secondary and tertiary 4 2 competence this paper assigns scenario ta1 as a baseline for assessing the performance of participants in emergency situations the probability of failure in ta1 is 0 66 4 2 1 emergency scenario requiring hazards avoidance and re routing th1 based on performance scores in this paper the probability of failure in group 1 in th1 is 0 93 of 17 participants in group 1 four 4 participants re routed from the primary to the secondary egress route after hearing the evacuation alarm papa and three 3 participants changed their route from the primary to the secondary egress route after encountering the hazards the difference in probabilities between ta1 and th1 is denoted as δriskgroup1 with a value of 0 27 the risk is shown in fig 2 the performance in ta1 and th1 show that participants preferred to use the primary route as their main means to the muster and lifeboat stations referring to performance scores in table 3 the probability of failure in group 2 in th1 is 0 84 the comparison of the probabilities of failure between th1 and ta1 results in a δriskgroup2 of 0 17 as shown in fig 2 one potential factor contributing to the risk is a small number of participants who did not change the route from the primary to the secondary egress route even after they heard the evacuation alarm papa and failed to arrive at the lifeboat station 4 2 2 emergency scenario requiring hazards avoidance and re routing th2 based on the performance scores used in this paper the probability of failure in group 1 in test scenario th2 is 0 72 comparing the data of ta1 as a baseline to assess performance in th2 it is found that δriskgroup1 is 0 06 as presented in fig 3 the potential factor contributing to the risk value is four 4 participants who failed to re route after hearing the papa alarm or after encountering the hazards there was also one participant who became lost and therefore failed to reach at the lifeboat station the probability of failure in group 2 in th2 is 0 85 the difference in probability of failure between ta1 and th2 is denoted as δriskgroup2 0 19 as shown in fig 3 some participants smith 2015 used the secondary egress route as a way to the lifeboat station no matter what the circumstances these participants did not re route even after they heard the papa alarm and after they encountered the hazard 4 3 behavioural compliance with exit signs duarte et al 2014 4 3 1 minimal signs as a baseline exit signs with a minimal design were used as a baseline in the case study duarte et al 2014 the probability of failure to follow minimal design of exit signs is 0 25 the highest probability of failure as shown in table 8 4 3 2 static exit signs and dynamic exit signs in fig 4 δriskstatic represents the difference in probability of failure between minimal exit signs and static exit signs it has a value of 0 19 this change in risk shows that the influence of static exit signs resulted in better performance than a group of participants using minimal exit signs during emergency duarte et al 2014 in the experimental study the probability of failure of participants to take egress routes following the direction shown by a dynamic exit signs is 0 01 using the minimal design of exit signs as a baseline with the probability of 0 25 the comparison of participants behavioural compliance with dynamic exit signs is denoted as δriskdynamic as shown in fig 4 δriskdynamic has a value of 0 24 the dynamic exit signs had more impact on participants decision to take egress routes during emergency than the static exit signs 4 4 confidence interval the confidence interval can show the uncertainty level the confidence interval is expressed as the upper and lower limits for the mean performance scores a small difference between the upper and lower limits indicates the less uncertainty 4 4 1 confidence interval for test scenarios in ta1 and ta3 fig 5 shows the confidence interval for avert emergency responses in ta1 and ta3 table a1 lists the mean and both the upper and lower limits for the test scenarios ta1 and ta3 the differences between the upper and lower limits of ta1 and ta3 are 4 01 and 5 67 respectively this indicates that the mean performance scores in ta1 based on the performance scores used in this paper is better than the mean performance scores in ta3 4 4 2 confidence interval for th1 referring to table a1 the differences between the upper and lower limits of groups 1 and 2 are 14 76 and 14 98 respectively as illustrated in fig 6 the uncertainty levels of of the means for groups 1 and 2 are considered high 4 4 3 confidence interval for th2 fig 7 presents the confidence interval of the mean for th2 as shown in table a1 the difference between the upper and lower limits of groups 1 and 2 are 14 41 and 15 92 respectively the big gap between the upper and lower limits indicates a high level of uncertainty in groups 1 and 2 4 4 4 confidence interval for behavioural compliance in exit signs the confidence interval for behavioural compliance to different types of exit signs is demonstrated in fig 8 referring to table a2 the difference between the upper and lower limits of the minimal static and dynamic signs are 1 00 1 21 and 0 99 respectively dynamic signage has the highest mean value and the lowest confidence interval compared to the other two types of exit signs this reflects that many participants took the exit route as directed by the dynamic signs 5 discussion and conclusion based on the experimental studies done by smith 2015 and duarte et al 2014 this paper analysed risks of emergency situations with and without engineered and procedural safety measures sections 5 1 to 5 3 discuss the use of virtual environments for assessing and managing risks in emergency scenarios 5 1 introducing individuals to emergency scenarios on offshore installations two experimental studies related to performance in emergency scenarios were used in this paper smith 2015 developed credible offshore emergency scenarios in a virtual environment ve to allow participants to practice emergency operations in the other study duarte et al 2014 participants were exposed to emergencies involving building evacuation in both studies the performance of participants was measured 5 2 designing and implementing new safety measures the use of virtual environments in a risk management study is a starting point for decision making on the design and implementation of new or existing structures or safety measures a virtual environment can be used to experiment with and implement new safety measures for emergency situations the decision to modify safety measures can be based on the performance of individuals interacting with the safety measures in a virtual environment 5 3 providing evidence to improve safety measures data on performance in emergency scenarios using virtual environments could provide support and evidence to improve engineered and procedural safety measures risks associated with performance in emergency scenarios using virtual environments can demonstrate the need for improvement of the existing safety measures key points virtual environment can be used to assess human responses and to provide data on risks associated with human responses during emergency situations human behaviour during emergency scenarios is dependent on the egress route choices and the training provided additional safety measures can improve performance during an emergency the new safety measures can be tested in a virtual environment prior to implementation in real life further testing is required to establish the long term effects of virtual environments on participants performance

23751,this paper presents the use of a virtual environment for investigating risks associated with human responses in emergency situations on offshore installations the virtual environment and the risk management can be used to analyze risks associated with human responses by investigating the effectiveness of existing safety measures identifying areas of improvement and proposing new designs for safety measures problems dealing with emergency scenarios on offshore installations is a tremendous undertaking the interaction of personnel using the safety measures in emergency situations can be affected by hazards environment conditions malfunctioning equipment and inadequate emergency preparedness such factors have the potential to prevent personnel from arriving at a safe area increase the level of risks and consequently cause injuries or fatalities to personnel risks associated with human responses in emergency scenarios are often unforeseen due to difficulties with modeling realistic emergency scenarios objective the objective of the research is to study demonstrate the use of virtual environments for investigating and managing risks associated with human responses in emergencies method risk management is employed to assess and manage risks associated with human responses in emergency scenarios the risk management is tested using experimental data collected from past studies of human responses in virtual environments results risks associated with human responses during emergency scenarios are determined by safety measures the environment and the egress route choices that have been taught participants performance and interaction with improved safety measures are better than the performance of participants without safety measures conclusion this paper provides a demonstration of the utility of virtual environments to assess risks associated with human responses in emergency situations application the findings of this study may be useful for offshore energy operations keywords emergency situation harsh environment human responses offshore installation risk management 1 introduction the organization or operator of offshore installations should prioritize the emergency response plan and safety barriers for escape in emergency situations safety measures for escape can include an alarm system primary and alternative escape routes muster stations and personal protective equipment e g health and safety executive hse 1997 canadian association of petroleum producers capp 2010 for offshore installations operating in harsh environmental conditions both escape routes and muster stations can be heat traced and fully enclosed to protect individuals when performing escape activities in cold temperatures eikill et al 2007 the organization must ensure that personnel practice emergency drills to familiarize themselves with the equipment and procedures and identify limitations potential hazards and risks in performing escape from hazardous areas the challenges and risks of performing escape depend on an individual s skills and experience teamwork procedures roles and responsibilities communication as well as the emergency response plan environment conditions and reliability of emergency equipment hse 2007 capp 2010a 2010b all of these factors influence the effectiveness of safety barriers the success of escape operations and the safety of individuals should an emergency occur the potential of hazards cannot be eliminated totally emergency situations in the presence of hazards can worsen when personnel fail to interact with emergency equipment and follow procedures consistently the effects of fires explosions and poor environmental conditions can cause failures of both personnel responses and the escape the probability of failure will increase further when escape is performed in adverse weather conditions or harsh environments such as in the presence of ice and snow cold temperatures darkness or strong winds mould 2001 kjellén 2007 there are many studies that have introduced or proposed effective tools and techniques as safety measures in emergency situations on offshore installation dimattia et al 2005 and deacon et al 2010 proposed prevention and mitigation barriers in risk management focusing on personnel performing escape evacuation and rescue eer activities andersen and mostue 2012 presented integrated operations io on risk management approaches using real time data collaborative techniques and multiple expertise in making better decisions and implementations for the norwegian oil and gas industry simulation based studies have been used before to investigate human performance in emergency scenarios doheny and fraser 1996 modelled an individual making decisions in an emergency scenario on offshore installations while considering the offshore facility relatively sparsely populated in a study of individuals behaviours conducted by ha et al 2014 walking direction was determined based on destination obstacles and visibility during emergency scenarios kim et al 2004 integrated both individuals behaviours and a dynamic model in the study of evacuation during marine accidents joo et al 2013 investigated dynamic individual actions interacting with emergent hazards such as fire using an agent based simulation duarte et al 2014 used a virtual environment to investigate dynamic versus static signs on human behaviour during emergency evacuation augustijn beckers et al 2010 studied pre evacuation behaviour and exit choice during emergency scenarios involving a group of individuals using a virtual environment of an offshore installation bradbury squires 2013 assessed efficacy of active and hybrid learning modes on task performance during emergency training smith 2015 and smith et al 2015 studied the effectiveness of simulation training on individual s competency and learning during emergency situations colombo and golzio 2016 introduced a simulation based approach to training teams including operators and managers in making decisions and increasing their competencies as a team in critical situations poor performance or lack of response in emergency situations can result in injuries and fatalities to personnel there is a need to reduce and manage risks associated with personnel performance in emergency situations on offshore installations the objective of the present work is to demonstrate the use of virtual environments for investigating and managing risks associated with human responses in emergencies engineered and procedural safety measures are studied and discussed in this paper see sections 3 1 2 and 3 2 2 the approach uses experimental data of human responses obtained from previous studies that used virtual environments duarte et al 2014 smith 2015 section 2 describes the risk calculation and its formulation section 3 explains experimental studies of human responses using virtual environments sections 4 and 5 present and conclude the risk management study 2 calculation of risks in this paper risk is assessed with regard to the probability of failures only in case studies used here we treat consequences of failure as neutral i e risk is proportional to probability only the probability of failures is calculated by considering the performance score in the emergency scenarios from two experimental studies as further explained in section 3 the performance score is analysed to determine the mean and standard deviation duarte et al 2014 smith 2015 information on mean and standard deviation is used to calculate a probability based on a normal distribution modarres 2006 this paper assumes a normal distribution to simplify the calculations the probability is calculated considering a normal distribution function a normal density function in equation 1 1 f x μ σ 1 2 π σ 2 exp x μ 2 2 σ 2 where x is the passing score μ is the average of overall scores σ is the standard deviation of scores σ2 is the variance in the distribution the next step is to estimate the risks associated with the human responses by comparing two different failure probabilities one is the emergency situation equipped with safety measures and the other is the emergency situation without safety measures the calculation of the change in risk is formulated as shown in equation 2 2 δ risk p r obability without safety measures probability with safety measures confidence intervals are employed to verify the calculation of probabilities and risks kumamoto and henley 1996 equation 3 is a formula for determining confidence interval the sample size mean and standard deviation are used to calculate the confidence interval of the mean the calculation is based on a normal distribution and a 95 percent confidence interval the results are presented in section 4 4 3 c i μ α σ n where α is the desired confidence level and n is the sample size 3 case studies of emergency scenarios in virtual environment data from two published experimental studies of different virtual environments have been selected to provide data for this risk management study the first experimental study entitled the effect of virtual environment training on participant competence and learning in offshore emergency egress scenarios is the source of data on human responses in an emergency scenario on an offshore installation smith 2015 the second experimental study entitled behavioural compliance for dynamic versus static signs in an immersive virtual environment is the source of data on behavioural compliance with signage duarte et al 2014 both experimental studies were conducted using virtual environments ve with the purpose to observe human responses and behaviours during emergency conditions duarte et al 2014 smith 2015 smith et al 2015 simulating emergency conditions in the ve can provide a safe medium for participants to acquire artificial experience which is otherwise impractical and risky to obtain in a real situation details of emergency scenarios in the ve are explained in sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 1 offshore emergency egress scenario on an offshore installation smith 2015 studied the effectiveness of simulation training on individual s competency and learning during emergency situations using the all hands virtual emergency response trainer avert software the layout in avert includes accommodations and a muster station and lifeboat station both located on the main deck three routes were provided as egress routes the primary route characterized as an interior route with an inside stairwell and secondary and tertiary routes characterized as exterior routes with an outside stairwell in the study smith 2015 the simulation scenarios begin with the activation of an emergency alarm general platform alarm that requires all personnel onboard to move to a muster station using one of the designated escape routes in the case of an escalating event an evacuation alarm prepare to abandon platform alarm is triggered to notify personnel to muster directly at the lifeboat station hazards such as blackouts fire and smoke were implemented in avert to create credible emergency scenarios the emergency scenario with the presence of hazards required participants to find a safe route to the muster or lifeboat station by avoiding the escape routes blocked by hazards smith 2015 3 1 1 participants of study in the study conducted by smith 2015 thirty six volunteers participated the participants ages ranged between 19 to 55 years old smith 2015 distributed a video game experience questionnaire to participants prior to dividing them into two groups that were balanced in terms of video game experience in the experiment the amount of practice the participants received differed according to the group participants in group 1 had repeated training participants in group 2 had a single exposure to training smith 2015 smith et al 2015 the 17 participants in group 1 reviewed training tutorials and repeated avert practice scenarios in preparation for the test scenarios the 19 participants in group 2 received the initial tutorial training and no avert practice scenarios 3 1 2 avert emergency response test scenarios of 12 emergency scenarios in the study done by smith 2015 four 4 emergency scenarios in avert were selected for this paper as listed in table 1 the four scenarios provide information related to engineered and procedural safety measures normal emergency lighting is categorized as an engineered safety measure for emergency scenarios emergency response procedures are the procedural measures used in the study these relate to the participants competence to respond to emergency scenarios this paper uses different performance scoring criteria than presented in smith 2015 details of performance scores are described in section 3 1 3 emergency lighting provided in the event of emergency is considered as an engineered safety measure the participants performance is compared to responses during two different emergency scenarios a in a normal lighting condition ta1 and b a blackout scenario ta3 according to smith 2015 wayfinding reflects the participants spatial knowledge of the platform specifically their understanding of the layout and egress routes in this paper the wayfinding is assessed by considering a the route selection primary secondary and tertiary routes b the arrival at the correct muster or lifeboat station and c incorrect deviations along the route the participants performance is compared to responses during two different emergency scenarios which are a in a normal lighting condition ta1 and b a blackout scenario ta3 ii competency of participants smith 2015 defined competence as the demonstration of knowledge related to alarm recognition routes and mapping and hazards avoidance which participants gained in the training tutorials the participants were evaluated based on their performance in recognizing types of alarm re routing and taking the safest routes avoiding hazards on route and arriving at the correct muster or lifeboat station smith 2015 participant s competency is considered as procedural safety this paper uses evaluation of participants competency in two emergency scenarios th1 and th2 as presented in table 1 with escalating events that required them to re route smith 2015 the criteria in the study performed by smith 2015 are selected as a subset for assessing and managing risks associated with human responses table 2 lists the subset criteria according to emergency scenario i equipped with the engineered safety measures and ii required knowledge of procedural safety 3 1 3 score for performance in test scenarios this paper uses a different scoring scheme than that used by smith 2015 because only a subset of smith s criteria are used here performance scores for the test scenarios in ta1 and ta3 are based on route selection and arrival at the correct location according to the type of alarm both ta1 and ta3 have 15 points as the total performance scores see table 3 test scenarios in th1 and th2 have performance scores based on route selection re routing when the route has been blocked hazard avoidance and arrival at the correct location both th1 and th2 have 35 points as the total performance scores 3 1 4 mean and standard deviation of emergency response test scenarios the performance scores are used to calculate mean and standard deviations for each test scenario this is followed by calculating the probability of failure based on the mean and standard deviations considering a normal distribution the probability of failure shows the numbers of actions failed according to the subset criteria in table 3 the probability of failure is shown in the range between 0 and 1 in this paper table 4 presents the mean standard deviation and probability of failure for the test scenarios of ta1 and ta3 the mean standard deviation and probability of failure in test scenarios th1 and th2 are listed in table 5 the mean and standard deviation in tables 4 and 5 are scores out of the total performance scores 3 2 behavioural compliance for dynamic versus static signs in a building evacuation researchers duarte et al 2014 used a virtual environment known as ergovr to investigate dynamic versus static signs on human behaviour during emergency evacuation ergovr simulated a building consisting of four 4 rooms meeting room laboratory cafeteria and warehouse the walls of the rooms and hallway have safety signs and exit signs the experiment required participants to go to every room and look for instructions for the given tasks in the scenario there was an emergency scenario involving an explosion followed by a fire when the participants entered a warehouse the fire alarm was triggered due to the explosion and fire in the ve all corridors except the exit route were affected by the hazard and blocked by flames and smoke the emergency scenario required participants to follow the exit signs in order to safely evacuate the building 3 2 1 participants of study a total of 90 participants consisting of university students were involved in the experimental study thirty 30 participants were assigned to each of the following groups according to the different types of exit signs a a minimal design b in a static configuration and c in a dynamic configuration duarte et al 2014 3 2 2 types of exit signage in the study conducted by duarte et al 2014 available egress routes were marked by exit signs consisting of an arrow and a running figure in a doorway the experiment varied the number of exit signs available and the type of exit signs static and dynamic signs three different types of exit signs are described in table 6 the objective of the study was to investigate human behaviour in complying with exit signs the participants were expected to move toward the exit door following the exit signs in order to evacuate the building safely they were given scores for the performance of safe evacuation duarte et al 2014 3 2 3 scores for behavioural measures the behaviour and performance of participants were assessed according to specific criteria duarte et al 2014 this paper uses complying with exit signage as one criteria to give six 6 points as the total performance score table 7 describes the criteria and scores for participants behavioural compliance in the simulation 3 2 4 mean and standard deviation of behavioural simulation using the results reported by duarte et al 2014 the participants performance scores were calculated to get the values of the mean and standard deviation for each type of exit sign provided in the simulation this was followed by calculating the probability of failure based on the mean and standard deviation assuming a normal distribution the mean standard deviation and probability of failure are listed in table 8 4 risk management of in emergency scenarios sections 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 present the results of data analysis for the following factors wayfinding in normal lighting conditions compared to blackout scenario competency of participants in emergency offshore evacuation and behavioural compliance with exit signs respectively the risk management in emergency scenarios are categorized into i engineered safety measures which are normal lighting and exit signage and ii procedural safety which reflects participants competence the results in sections 4 1 4 3 are supported by confidence intervals in section 4 4 4 1 impact of lighting condition and blackout scenario on wayfinding two scenarios from smith s study 2015 were used to look at the effect of visibility on the risk associated with making wayfinding errors ta1 represents a normal lighting condition ta3 represents a blackout condition the change in risk represents the difference between the probabilities of failure for the blackout and normal lighting scenarios denoted as δriskblackout as indicated in fig 1 the risk is 0 04 the risk of making wayfinding errors is high due to the difference between participants route selection in the two scenarios participants showed a tendency to select the primary route in normal lighting conditions however during the blackout scenario participants seemed to use any of the available routes i e primary secondary and tertiary 4 2 competence this paper assigns scenario ta1 as a baseline for assessing the performance of participants in emergency situations the probability of failure in ta1 is 0 66 4 2 1 emergency scenario requiring hazards avoidance and re routing th1 based on performance scores in this paper the probability of failure in group 1 in th1 is 0 93 of 17 participants in group 1 four 4 participants re routed from the primary to the secondary egress route after hearing the evacuation alarm papa and three 3 participants changed their route from the primary to the secondary egress route after encountering the hazards the difference in probabilities between ta1 and th1 is denoted as δriskgroup1 with a value of 0 27 the risk is shown in fig 2 the performance in ta1 and th1 show that participants preferred to use the primary route as their main means to the muster and lifeboat stations referring to performance scores in table 3 the probability of failure in group 2 in th1 is 0 84 the comparison of the probabilities of failure between th1 and ta1 results in a δriskgroup2 of 0 17 as shown in fig 2 one potential factor contributing to the risk is a small number of participants who did not change the route from the primary to the secondary egress route even after they heard the evacuation alarm papa and failed to arrive at the lifeboat station 4 2 2 emergency scenario requiring hazards avoidance and re routing th2 based on the performance scores used in this paper the probability of failure in group 1 in test scenario th2 is 0 72 comparing the data of ta1 as a baseline to assess performance in th2 it is found that δriskgroup1 is 0 06 as presented in fig 3 the potential factor contributing to the risk value is four 4 participants who failed to re route after hearing the papa alarm or after encountering the hazards there was also one participant who became lost and therefore failed to reach at the lifeboat station the probability of failure in group 2 in th2 is 0 85 the difference in probability of failure between ta1 and th2 is denoted as δriskgroup2 0 19 as shown in fig 3 some participants smith 2015 used the secondary egress route as a way to the lifeboat station no matter what the circumstances these participants did not re route even after they heard the papa alarm and after they encountered the hazard 4 3 behavioural compliance with exit signs duarte et al 2014 4 3 1 minimal signs as a baseline exit signs with a minimal design were used as a baseline in the case study duarte et al 2014 the probability of failure to follow minimal design of exit signs is 0 25 the highest probability of failure as shown in table 8 4 3 2 static exit signs and dynamic exit signs in fig 4 δriskstatic represents the difference in probability of failure between minimal exit signs and static exit signs it has a value of 0 19 this change in risk shows that the influence of static exit signs resulted in better performance than a group of participants using minimal exit signs during emergency duarte et al 2014 in the experimental study the probability of failure of participants to take egress routes following the direction shown by a dynamic exit signs is 0 01 using the minimal design of exit signs as a baseline with the probability of 0 25 the comparison of participants behavioural compliance with dynamic exit signs is denoted as δriskdynamic as shown in fig 4 δriskdynamic has a value of 0 24 the dynamic exit signs had more impact on participants decision to take egress routes during emergency than the static exit signs 4 4 confidence interval the confidence interval can show the uncertainty level the confidence interval is expressed as the upper and lower limits for the mean performance scores a small difference between the upper and lower limits indicates the less uncertainty 4 4 1 confidence interval for test scenarios in ta1 and ta3 fig 5 shows the confidence interval for avert emergency responses in ta1 and ta3 table a1 lists the mean and both the upper and lower limits for the test scenarios ta1 and ta3 the differences between the upper and lower limits of ta1 and ta3 are 4 01 and 5 67 respectively this indicates that the mean performance scores in ta1 based on the performance scores used in this paper is better than the mean performance scores in ta3 4 4 2 confidence interval for th1 referring to table a1 the differences between the upper and lower limits of groups 1 and 2 are 14 76 and 14 98 respectively as illustrated in fig 6 the uncertainty levels of of the means for groups 1 and 2 are considered high 4 4 3 confidence interval for th2 fig 7 presents the confidence interval of the mean for th2 as shown in table a1 the difference between the upper and lower limits of groups 1 and 2 are 14 41 and 15 92 respectively the big gap between the upper and lower limits indicates a high level of uncertainty in groups 1 and 2 4 4 4 confidence interval for behavioural compliance in exit signs the confidence interval for behavioural compliance to different types of exit signs is demonstrated in fig 8 referring to table a2 the difference between the upper and lower limits of the minimal static and dynamic signs are 1 00 1 21 and 0 99 respectively dynamic signage has the highest mean value and the lowest confidence interval compared to the other two types of exit signs this reflects that many participants took the exit route as directed by the dynamic signs 5 discussion and conclusion based on the experimental studies done by smith 2015 and duarte et al 2014 this paper analysed risks of emergency situations with and without engineered and procedural safety measures sections 5 1 to 5 3 discuss the use of virtual environments for assessing and managing risks in emergency scenarios 5 1 introducing individuals to emergency scenarios on offshore installations two experimental studies related to performance in emergency scenarios were used in this paper smith 2015 developed credible offshore emergency scenarios in a virtual environment ve to allow participants to practice emergency operations in the other study duarte et al 2014 participants were exposed to emergencies involving building evacuation in both studies the performance of participants was measured 5 2 designing and implementing new safety measures the use of virtual environments in a risk management study is a starting point for decision making on the design and implementation of new or existing structures or safety measures a virtual environment can be used to experiment with and implement new safety measures for emergency situations the decision to modify safety measures can be based on the performance of individuals interacting with the safety measures in a virtual environment 5 3 providing evidence to improve safety measures data on performance in emergency scenarios using virtual environments could provide support and evidence to improve engineered and procedural safety measures risks associated with performance in emergency scenarios using virtual environments can demonstrate the need for improvement of the existing safety measures key points virtual environment can be used to assess human responses and to provide data on risks associated with human responses during emergency situations human behaviour during emergency scenarios is dependent on the egress route choices and the training provided additional safety measures can improve performance during an emergency the new safety measures can be tested in a virtual environment prior to implementation in real life further testing is required to establish the long term effects of virtual environments on participants performance

23752,numerical models are becoming a valid supplement and even a substitute to physical model testing for the investigation of fluid structure interaction due to improved methods and a continuous increase in computational power this research presents an extensive validation of a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank for the simulation of complex fluid structure interaction of moored floating structures the validation is carried out against laboratory measurements including recent and unpublished laboratory measurements of the oc5 floating offshore wind turbine subjected to waves the numerical wave tank is based on the navier stokes 6 dof solver interdymfoam provided by the open source cfd toolbox openfoam extended with the wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam and an implementation for restraints of floating structures two methods are evaluated to address the instability issues of the partitioned navier stokes 6 dof solver which are associated with artificial added mass the model has been shown capable of computing detailed fluid structure interactions including dynamic motion response of a rigid structure in waves however instabilities due to numerical added mass is observed and discussed and it is concluded that further research is needed in order to establish a efficient yet stable scheme overall good agreement is achieved between the numerical model and the physical model results keywords floating offshore wind turbines openfoam coupled cfd 6 dof waves2foam mooring lines 1 introduction in recent years a transformation in energy supply from burning of fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources such as solar wind and hydropower is seen in northern europe this change is mainly driven by wind energy and lately also offshore wind energy the increase in wind energy capacity is expected to continue for several decades partly by replacing existing capacity with newer larger and more efficient turbines but for the greater part by the installation of new wind farms pineda et al 2014 offshore wind energy installations are expected to produce approximately 2 9 of the total european union energy demand by 2020 this foreseen growth will move offshore wind energy from an emerging and immature technology to a key component of the energy mix arapogianni et al 2011 current developments of offshore wind are primarily based on bottom mounted foundations and the vast majority of those on monopile foundations gravity based substructures are the second most common foundation type followed by jacket structures however many countries have limited suitable sites in sufficiently shallow water to economically install offshore wind turbines on bottom mounted substructures floating offshore wind turbine fowt concepts are seen as a promising solution to unlock the offshore potential in deeper waters this technology is still at an early stage of development and well validated modelling tools capable of simulating dynamic behaviour are necessary to improve the design of these floating structures arapogianni et al 2013 one of the challenges for fowt at intermediate water depth 50 m h 120 m is optimizing the dynamic behaviour of the mooring system while retaining a limited footprint optimization of mooring systems for semi submersibles and fowt foundations are discussed in robertson et al 2011 brommundt et al 2012 huijs 2015 the common approach for these studies is to use numerical models to analyse different load cases including the effect of wind and wave however not discussed in this paper the presented and validated numerical model is suitable for such analysis and one of the reasons why this research was initialized the international energy agency has facilitated a series of international collaboration projects to improve offshore wind modelling tools these projects aim to verify and validate the accuracy of complex engineering tools through code to code and code to data comparisons jonkman and musial 2010 popko et al 2012 robertson et al 2014b the most recent of these projects is the offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation oc5 this project continues with the improvement of modelling tools based on the dynamic analysis of the deepcwind design koo et al 2014 robertson et al 2014a this semi submersible design features a 5 mw horizontal axis wind turbine with pitch controlled blades developed by the national renewable energy laboratory jonkman et al 2009 popko et al 2012 the simulation tools applied in these research projects are frequency domain potential flow models such as aqwa ansys 2010 and wamit lee and newman 2006 these lower order numerical models are used to determine the frequency dependent added mass and damping coefficients the output from these models is used in a time domain model e g fast jonkman et al 2014 to perform the transient analysis especially for the analysis of a fowt in extreme conditions where these lower order models may be less reliable it could be beneficial to use a higher order numerical model for describing the fluid structure interaction higher order numerical models like computational fluid dynamics cfd combined with 6 dof simulations have been successfully used as a tool in many areas of engineering with cfd models it is possible to use higher order wave models and even accurately simulate wave breaking the major benefit of using a higher order cfd 6 dof model is the capability of solving the fluid structure interaction problem based on the geometry and mass properties of the floating structure without predetermining coefficients however the accuracy of predictions and numerical convergence needs to be validated in order to use cfd 6 dof models as a reliable design tool for floating offshore structures the objective of this research is to establish a well validated fully nonlinear numerical wave tank for the accurate simulation of complex fluid structure interaction of moored floating offshore structures using a higher order cfd 6 dof model based on the opensource cfd toolbox openfoam weller et al 1998 section 2 provides an overview of the numerical models used to set up the numerical wave tank in section 3 the numerical model is validated against theoretical and experimental data this validation consists of three approaches first a wave load and decay case with a two dimensional cylinder are presented where the model is validated against benchmark experimental and theoretical data from dixon et al 1979 ito 1977 and maskell and ursell 1970 secondly the model is used to simulate three dimensional moored decay of a fowt from the oc5 projects lastly the moored fowt is subjected to regular incoming waves both the decay and wave loading cases with the oc5 fowt are validated against physical experiments these tests were carried out in the concept basin at marin and besides focusing on hydrodynamic loading also the effect of the wind turbine controller on the dynamics of the floater was investigated 2 material and methods the multiphase interdymfoam solver of openfoam is a segregated fluid structure interaction solver where the flow dependent motions of a rigid body are obtained by solving the navier stokes and 6 dof equations in a coupled manner the coupled navier stokes 6 dof solver has an unstable nature as discussed in seng 2012 and dunbar et al 2015 in the present work two different methods for stabilizing such a solver are evaluated here the standard interdymfoam solver provided by the opensource cfd toolbox openfoam weller et al 1998 version 2 3 1 is extended with the wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 this combination is referred to as the wavedymfoam solver furthermore an implementation for the restraints of floating structures was developed the structure of this section is as follows first the governing equations for the navier stokes volume of fluid vof solver are presented in section 2 1 the differences between the two stabilizing methods are described in section 2 2 in section 2 3 the restraints implementation is presented the applied boundary conditions are presented in section 2 4 wave generation and absorption with relaxation zones is described in section 2 5 and finally the spatial and temporal discretization is described in section 2 6 2 1 governing equations navier stokes vof the wavedymfoam solver utilizes the two phase incompressible navier stokes equations in combination with a vof surface capturing scheme hirt and nichols 1981 to compute fluid structure interaction the governing equations used in the navier stokes vof solver for conservation of mass and momentum of an incompressible flow of air and water are given by 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u t p g x ρ μ u where x y z is the three dimensional gradient operator u u v w is the velocity field in cartesian coordinates g is the gravitational acceleration and p is pressure in excess of the hydrostatic pressure which relates to the total pressure p by 3 p p ρ g x furthermore the local density ρ and viscosity μ are given by the water volume fraction α consistent with 4 ρ α ρ w a t e r ρ a i r 1 α 5 μ α μ w a t e r μ a i r 1 α where α is zero for air one for water and a mixture of the two for all intermediate values openfoam uses a vof method for tracking the air water interface after obtaining the velocity field by solving equations 1 and 2 for the two phase flow of air and water the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 can be used to advance the α field in time with the following scalar advection equation 6 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 using a standard finite volume approximation for solving the hyperbolic advection equation 6 would lead to significant smearing of the interface this is significantly reduced by the introduction of an interface compression term as discussed in berberović et al 2009 in equation 6 this is the last term of the left hand side the interface compression term is only active in the vicinity of the interface 0 α 1 where its strength is governed by the relative velocity u r it is stressed that even though u r has the dimension of m s it lacks any physical meaning to ensure stability a multi dimensional flux limited scheme mules is used for solving the scalar advection equation 6 2 2 stability of a coupled navier stokes 6 dof solver in order to simulate the flow dependent motion response of a floating structure a partitioned fluid structure interaction model is used here the rigid body motion is obtained by separately solving the navier stokes and 6 dof motion equations for the fluid and the solid for numerical models with a loos coupling between the fluid solver and the motion of the body the discrete time integration may become unstable leading to non physical motion of the object effectively these instabilities appear as a numerical added mass and hence change the behaviour of the structure if the density difference between the fluid and the body becomes smaller the fluid has a larger influence on the motions of the body and numerical simulations are more prone to instabilities the temporal discretization of the numerical simulation was also found to have a significant effect on the stability of the solution thorough discussions on instabilities in partitioned fluid structure interaction models as a result of artificial added mass can be found in the work by causin et al 2005 förster et al 2007 and seng 2012 a common solution to counter the instabilities due to artificial added mass is to implement a tighter coupling in tighter coupled solvers the solutions for both the fluid and the rigid body motion are more converged before the simulation advances to the next time step both piro and maki 2013 and dunbar et al 2015 were able to increase the numerical stability in complex fluid structure interaction problems by introducing a subiteration loop around the navier stokes and 6 dof motion solvers and applying dynamic relaxation to the body force the open source cfd toolbox openfoam version 2 3 1 provides two methods for in increasing numerical stability in fluid structure interaction problems an under relaxation and a predictor corrector method both methods will be evaluated in the present work the difference between the two methods is in the pimple loop which is used to perform time stepping for a comprehensive review of the pimple method the reader is referred to ferziger and peric 2012 2 2 1 under relaxation method the under relaxation method is embedded in the 6 dof loop as can be observed from the algorithm presented at the end of this section in this method an under relaxation factor is applied to the acceleration of the rigid body in the 6 dof loop first the forces and moments on the body are calculated from these forces and moments the displacement and rotation of the body is determined for a certain time step with the under relaxation method the acceleration of the center of gravity cog of the structure is relaxed by an under relaxation factor f a according to 7 a i f a a i 1 f a a i 1 where a i is the under relaxed acceleration of the cog of the structure at the instantaneous time step please note that a can be directional and rotational acceleration furthermore the relaxation of a only starts from the second time step the applied under relaxation method effectively acts as a low pass filter removing high frequency oscillations from the time integration by doing so the stability of the solver is improved however it also introduces a diffusive term to the numerical model which can have a negative effect on the convergence rate of the solution throughout the present research the default under relaxation factor of 0 5 is used this value was found to provide acceptable stability while maintaining sufficient level of accuracy image 1 2 2 2 predictor corrector method the predictor corrector method implements a subiteration loop around the navier stokes and 6 dof solvers as well as under relaxation of the pressure field as can be seen from the algorithm presented at the end of this section the subiteration loop allows the numerical model to make an initial predictor step and one or more corrector steps in the predictor step first the displacement of the body is estimated from the forces acting on the body as is also done in the standard solver the second step is to update the pressure field and recalculate the corrected displacement of the body to smooth the convergence an under relaxation factor f p is applied to the pressure field according to 8 p i f p p i 1 f p p i 1 where p i is the under relaxed pressure field in contrast to the work of dunbar et al 2015 no dynamic relaxation was applied however a constant under relaxation factor f p of 0 5 was applied note that the under relaxation factor for the pressure field is reset to 1 for the last subiteration loop to ensure time consistence throughout the present work the number of subiterations was fixed to 3 image 2 2 3 restraints for moving boundaries two types of restraints for moving boundaries are implemented a linear spring and a simple catenary type mooring line it should be noted that this simple mooring line implementation does not take the interaction with the fluid into account thus it is not influenced by waves or current 2 3 1 linear spring the linear spring is implemented without any damping and the line is given a simple constant stiffness and a rest length force formulation of the spring follows hooke s law the spring is defined such that the force in the spring is zero when the length of the spring is equal to the rest length 2 3 2 mooring line the simple catenary type mooring line implementation is used for anchoring a floating structure to the seabed where the shape and force formulations are adopted from krenk 2001 it should be noted that a flat horizontal seabed is assumed in the presented mooring line implementation three different mooring line states are defined simple state resting state and hanging state see fig 1 2 3 2 1 simple state in the simple state see fig 1a the mooring line is completely in suspension i e the anchor point p 0 is equal to the touchdown point p t the formulation follows the restoring force in a catenary line between two attachment points where the distance between the attachment points is less than the length of the line krenk 2001 the line cannot break while the distance between the connected objects can exceed the defined length of the line beyond this defined length the line is treated as a linear spring where the stiffness of the line is based on the magnitude of the restraining force in the catenary line at the limit of its length 2 3 2 2 resting state the resting state see fig 1b is the mooring line state where the floating structure is so close to the anchor point that a part of the catenary line is resting on the sea bed the remainder of the cable will behave as a catenary line as defined in the simple state the touchdown point p t is evaluated by finding the resting length of the line that ensures that the slope of the line at the touchdown point is horizontal krenk 2001 2 3 2 3 hanging state the hanging state is defined as the state where the floating object is so close to the anchor point that the piecewise linear configuration of the mooring line is shorter than the length of the mooring line see fig 1c only a vertical force acts in the attachment point which is equal to the weight of the suspended part of the line 2 4 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations of the navier stokes vof solver boundary conditions are specified for all surfaces in the numerical domain before going into the allocation of particular boundary conditions the general denomination of the boundary surfaces is given in a schematic representation of the numerical domain see fig 2 it should be noted that a structure will be present inside the numerical domain at the inlet and outlet boundary surfaces the velocities u and the α field are given by a closed form analytic wave theory this technique works well and allows minimisation of the start up time by initialising the free surface with the incident wave profile at the surface of the body a slip condition is applied which means that the viscous boundary layer near the body is not resolved however the governing equations still contains the effect of viscosity and turbulence generation due to internal stresses and the free surface motion near the structure i e viscous effects due to wave breaking or splashing near the structure are included the viscous boundary layer is not resolved as this requires the usage of a turbulence model which often influences the evolution of the free surface brown et al 2014 development of turbulence models which can model a structural boundary layer without influencing the propagation of the free surface is on going research the viscous boundary layer at the seabed is neglected since typically the propagation of waves with a cfd solver is limited to only a couple of wave lengths and in such simulations the influence of the seabed on the wave dissipation is small a slip condition is applied to the side walls of the three dimensional numerical wave tank as presented in section 3 3 while for the two dimensional computations as presented in section 3 1 and 3 2 an empty condition was applied to the front and back walls at the atmosphere boundary layer of the numerical domain an atmospheric boundary condition is applied for the velocity u and the α field this means that air and water are allowed to leave the numerical domain while only air is allowed to flow back in furthermore the total pressure at the atmosphere boundary is equal to zero 2 5 relaxation zones in present work the wave generation toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 was used to implement relaxation zones in the numerical domain for the validation cases without incoming waves as presented in section 3 2 and 3 3 1 relaxation zones are implemented at the in and outlet of the domain to absorb waves generated by the structure s motion the relaxation zones for the two validation cases where a structure is subjected to incoming waves as presented in section 3 1 and 3 3 2 are set up to generate a continuous propagating wave the relaxation zone at the inlet is used to generate the incoming waves while the relaxation zone at the outlet is set up to produce the undisturbed incoming wave profile thus minimizing reflections from the inlet and outlet boundary layers see bruinsma 2016 for a more detailed description of this particular relaxation zone set up as the physical wave maker signal is unknown an exact reproduction of hydrodynamic conditions used in the various benchmark cases is not possible instead fully nonlinear stream function waves fenton 1990 of the required height and period are used 2 6 spatial and temporal discretization the numerical domains used in this research are created using the blockmesh and snappyhexmesh utilities provided by openfoam the numerical wave tank is formed as a box domain which is generated with blockmesh and snappyhexmesh is used to sculpt the surface boundary of the structure inside the mesh generation of the structure surface boundary is done by local refinement and reconstruction of cells where 2 2 and 4 4 levels of refinement were used for the two and three dimensional domains this local refinement allows for a high resolution interface while keeping the total number of computational cells relatively low the spatial discretization of the numerical domains is based on the cell size next to the structure surface boundary which in turn is defined by the number of points per cylinder diameter p p c d as 9 δ d p p c d this means that for the two dimensional cases the cells closest to the structure surface boundary have a dimension equal to the number of p p c d whereas the cells outside the refinement zone are 4 times as large for the temporal discretization i e determining the time step of the numerical simulations the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is used throughout the present research a courant number equal to 0 25 is applied 3 results this section presents the results of the benchmark cases performed to validate the numerical model the first case presented in section 3 1 regards the simulation of wave loading on a fixed partially submerged horizontal cylinder in a two dimensional fixed mesh here the numerical results are compared against experimental data from dixon et al 1979 in section 3 2 the two stabilizing methods for the navier stokes 6 dof coupling are evaluated on the basis of the heave decay of a free floating horizontal cylinder in a two dimensional numerical domain with a dynamic mesh where the numerical result is compared to theoretical work by maskell and ursell 1970 and experimental work by ito 1977 please note that for these two validation cases the application of a 2d domain was part of the validation and since there is good agreement with the experimental results the 2d approach is justified in section 3 3 the numerical model is validated with a number of three dimensional physical model tests with the moored oc5 fowt first the moored heave pitch and roll decay tests are evaluated in section 3 3 1 and finally the floating structure is subjected to unidirectional regular waves the results from this numerical simulation are presented in section 3 3 2 3 1 flow induced pressures on a fixed body in this first validation case the numerical model is used to reproduce results from the wave loading experiments from the work of dixon et al 1979 these simulations are performed to determine whether the navier stokes solver is capable of accurately simulating fluid structure interaction so without the additional complexities of moving meshes and the coupling of the navier stokes and 6 dof solvers the work by dixon et al 1979 presents a series of physical experiments where vertical and horizontal forces on a fixed horizontal cylinder induced by regular waves were determined for various wave amplitudes and levels of cylinder submergence it was discovered that the cylinder s varying buoyancy can play an equally large role as the inertial force in the resultant vertical force in particular cases this led to negative vertical force profiles which act at twice the wave frequency in these cases the inertial coefficient c m in morison s equation becomes negative by introducing a varying volume and buoyancy term to morison s equation dixon et al were able to reformulate the analytical description thus achieving better correspondence with the experimental results table 2 shows a selection of the experimental and theoretical results of dixon et al for various relative wave amplitudes and a constant submergence depth of the cylinder d equal to zero here d is measured from the cylinders centroid to the still water level i e the cylinder is half submerged the relative wave amplitude a is the ratio of the wave amplitude a to the cylinder diameter d for the comparison of the various results the dimensionless root mean square rms vertical force is calculated using 10 f r m s 1 n k 1 n f k 2 where f r m s is the rms force and f k the relative vertical force component at each time step which is the total vertical force on the cylinder divided by the buoyancy force of the totally submerged cylinder fig 3 shows a schematic representation of the numerical domain used for the two dimensional cases presented in this section and section 3 2 for this section the domain dimensions are l 4 λ d 0 5 m a 0 25 m d 0 1 m and d 0 0 m the boundary conditions relaxation zones and numerical discretization are defined according to the two dimensional set up described in section 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 to verify grid independence a grid sensitivity analysis is carried out for one of the wave loading cases the applied spatial discretizations are presented in table 1 in fig 4 the numerical results for the vertical force on the cylinder are presented along with the experimental solutions from dixon et al 1979 it can be observed that the numerical solution is converging with increasing grid resolution please note that since the cfl condition is used to determine the time step an increase in the spatial resolution also results in an increase in the temporal resolution the highest resolution was selected for all further simulations in this section in order to ensure a high level of convergence five simulations are performed with a constant relative axis depth d 0 0 while the relative amplitude of the wave is varying from 0 1 to 0 5 for all simulations the rms force f r m s is computed and these are presented in table 2 where the error with respect to the experimental data from dixon et al 1979 is also presented it can be observed that the numerically computed rms forces are slightly underestimating the experimental data and the offset with the experimental rms force increases for the higher amplitude waves this underestimation could be a result of not resolving the viscous boundary layer near the body and this is an interesting topic for future research the rms forces show that the numerical model is able to determine the general forcing over a single wave period however for a more detailed evaluation of the accuracy of the numerical model the force profiles are presented in fig 5 it may be observed that for the smaller amplitude waves both the theoretical and numerical forcing show good correspondence with the experimental data however for relative amplitudes larger than 0 2 the theoretical formulation lacks accuracy in the loading caused by the wave crest passing the cylinder much better consensus is achieved between the experimental data and the numerical results the force profiles are in general better aligned and especially the prediction of the peak forces caused by the passing wave crest is more in line with the experimental results overall it may be concluded that the navier stokes solver was able to accurately simulate the wave loading on a fixed horizontal cylinder 3 2 flow induced motions of a free floating body from section 3 1 it follows that the numerical wave tank can be used to accurately calculate flow induced pressures on a fixed body in the present section the ability of the numerical wave tank to simulate flow induced motions of a free floating two dimensional horizontal cylinder is evaluated as described in section 2 2 artificial added mass may cause instabilities in loosely coupled partitioned solvers this section explores whether the under relaxation and predictor corrector method can improve the stability of the navier stokes 6 dof solver while maintaining a high level of accuracy the validation is performed on a benchmark case of the heave decay of a free floating horizontal cylinder with theoretical results from maskell and ursell 1970 and experimental results from ito 1977 in their work maskell and ursell 1970 present a theoretical formulation for the decay of heave motion of a free floating horizontal cylinder this theory was later validated by experimental work from ito 1977 the numerical domain set up for the simulation of the heaving cylinder is similar to the one used for the validation cases presented in section 3 1 a schematic representation is presented in fig 3 where l 6 m d 1 24 m a 0 2 m and d 0 1524 m the initial vertical displacement of the cylinders cog with respect to the still water level is equal to one sixth of the cylinder diameter or d 0 0254 m relaxation zones with a length of 1 m are implemented at both ends of the domain to absorb waves generated by the heaving cylinder the boundary layer conditions relaxation zones and numerical discretization are defined according to the two dimensional set up described in section 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 the vertical displacement of a the cylinder s cog relative to the still water level is presented in fig 6 please note that the cylinder density of the cylinder is half that of the fluid and that the cylinder is half submerged in the equilibrium the cylinder was dropped from an initial displacement of d 0 0254 m note that the initial velocity of the cylinder is equal to zero the spatial discretization of the computational domain is presented in table 3 where the grid resolution of 40 p p c d is adopted from the grid sensitivity study of the wave loading simulation discussed in section 3 1 overall it can be concluded from the transient heave responses presented in fig 6 that in spite of the small differences introduced by different stabilizing methods the numerical solver is able to provide an accurate solution to the physical problem from the error in the period and amplitude of the first peak response in the cylinder s transient motion presented in table 4 it can be observed that both transient motions of the simulations without a stabilizer and with the under relaxation method show slight overestimations of amplitude while result obtained with the predictor corrector method is found to be in better correspondence with the experimental result from ito 1977 to examine the reliability of the solver in terms of stability the velocity and force profiles are evaluated fig 7 presents the normalized vertical velocity of the cylinder s cog and in fig 8 the vertical force on the cylinder is presented oscillation in the velocity and force profiles are a sign of instabilities in the numerical model no significant disturbances could be observed in the velocity profiles of the three numerical simulations while in the force profiles clear disturbances can be observed for the un stabilized numerical simulation severe oscillations start to appear as the maximum negative displacement is reached at around t g d 4 when the under relaxation method is applied it can be seen that the force profile stabilizes to some degree however some oscillations and a number of large force spikes can still be observed it may be observed that the predictor corrector method provides the most stability as only minor oscillations and no force spikes are visible in the resulting force profile it should be noted that the added stability comes at a price for the predictor corrector method the execution time increases due to the additional iteration loops and for the under relaxation method the accuracy of the solution decreases as a result of under relaxation of the acceleration while time stepping furthermore the execution time is slightly increased with respect to the unstabilized simulation the predictor corrector method was selected for all further computations because of its high level of accuracy and stability for engineering purposes it might in some cases be more useful to apply the under relaxation method as decent result are obtained at lower computational cost 3 3 flow induced motions of a moored floating wind turbine from section 3 2 it follows that the numerical wave tank can be used to accurately calculate flow induced motions of a free floating two dimensional horizontal cylinder and that the numerical stability can be improved significantly by using the predictor corrector method described in section 2 2 2 the present section evaluates the capability of the numerical wave tank to simulate the motions of a moored three dimensional floating body the aim of this section is to validate the numerical model against physical experiments with the generic oc5 fowt that were performed in the concept basin at marin these scale model tests were part of the to2 floating wind research project which was carried out by dutch research institutes deltares ecn marin and nlr see bruinsma 2016 first a series of three simulations of moored decay tests is presented in section 3 3 1 after which the simulation of a wave loading test is evaluated in section 3 3 2 the wave tank used for the physical experiments is depicted in fig 9 note that a 1 50 froude scaling is applied and that unless otherwise stated all dimensions and properties are presented in model scale due to the limited width of the physical wave tank the oc5 s original three line spread mooring system could not be installed instead the mooring system consisted of a front and back mooring line in combination with two horizontal linear springs which were designed so that restoring properties of the system would be close to those of the original three line system a schematic representation of the numerical domain used for the validation cases in this section is presented in fig 10 for the simulation of heave pitch and roll decay presented in section 3 3 1 the length l is equal to 4 0 m as is the width of the physical domain and the height is equal to 5 0 m of which 4 0 m is the water depth relaxation zones with a length of 1 m are implemented at both ends of the domain to absorb waves generated by the motions of the floating structure for the simulation of the wave loading on the oc5 fowt presented in section 3 3 2 the length of the domain is slightly larger to allow for more lateral movement of the floating structure the total length of the domain is equal to one wave length l 6 4 m and the relaxation zones used for the generation and absorption of waves are equal to a quarter of a wave length as the physical wave maker signal is unknown an exact reproduction of the experiments is not possible instead fully nonlinear stream function waves of the same height h 0 14 m and period t 1 71 s is used fenton 1990 the boundary layer conditions relaxation zones and numerical discretization are defined according to the descriptions in section 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 it may be noted that the length of the numerical domain is much smaller than that of the physical wave tank this is possible due to the simple mooring line implementation see section 2 3 2 which is simulated as a force in the attachment points on the fowt and thereby they do not limit the domain size this also means that although the adjusted mooring system is used the numerical simulation could be performed equally well with the original oc5 three line spread mooring system furthermore the sub structure turbine tower nacelle and blades are considered as one rigid body with a single moment of inertia and cog since mainly the fluid structure interaction is considered only the sub structure is modelled in the numerical domain 3 3 1 decay tests with a moored floating wind turbine for all the heave pitch and roll simulations the initial position of the sub structure is modelled in the base mesh the physical properties of the floating wind turbine and the mooring system are presented in table 5 the pre tension in the horizontal springs in the physical mooring system is not measured therefore marin provided a best estimate pre tension of 0 256 n for a more detailed discussion on the numerical set up and the physical properties of the floating structure and mooring system the reader is referred to bruinsma 2016 to verify grid independence a grid sensitivity analysis is carried out on the heave decay test with the moored fowt the applied spatial discretizations are presented in table 6 in fig 11 the numerical results for the vertical displacement of the cog of the fowt are presented along with the results from the physical model tests it can be observed that the transient response of the fowt is converging with increasing spatial and temporal resolution it may be argued that the lowest resolution of 5 p p c d is not high enough to resolve the challenging physics of this heave decay test however for the higher resolution the numerical solution matches the experimental result quite well this is especially true for the first two heave periods after which the numerical and experimental results start to disagree more significantly it may be noted that in the experimental results a slight increase in the downward amplitude of the heave displacement can be observed at t t 2 5 the source is not explained however it is speculated that it is related to the mooring system in particular to the horizontal springs to evaluate the simulation in terms of the numerical stability as was done for the two dimensional decaying cylinder the vertical velocity of the cog of the floating structure and vertical force on the floating structure are presented in figs 12 and 13 respectively from these figures it may be concluded that as only minor disturbances can be observed in the force profiles the predictor corrector method is able to provide a stable solution to keep the computational demand relatively low the spatial resolution of 10 p p c d is selected for all further computations since the obtained accuracy with respect to the experimental solution was seen to be in the order of one percent both in term of amplitude and period see table 7 where the error after one heave period is presented the numerical and experimental results of the moored pitch decay test are presented in fig 14 to isolate the pitch rotation the numerical model was restricted to the pitch rotation while it was free to translate in the x y and z direction it may be observed that the damping of the pitch motion is slightly lower in the numerical simulation resulting in a larger response amplitude with respect to the experimental solution an overestimation of approximately 18 per cent was observed for the first response amplitude presented in table 7 on the other hand the period of the pitch decay motion is slightly lower than the experimental result the numerical and experimental results of the moored roll decay test are presented in fig 15 it can be observed that an excellent correspondence with the experimental result was achieved as only small differences are observed in terms of amplitude and period of the pitch response see table 7 note that the experimental roll angle shows a irregularity at negative roll angles so when the floater is leaning to port side although this abnormality does not seem to have a significant influence on the general progression of the roll signal it should be noted that the interpretation of these results needs to be done with great care it was observed that the horizontal springs used in the mooring system were at times hitting the water surface when they became slack this unintended interaction with the water is not modelled in the numerical simulation it is argued that these and other assumptions with respect to the numerical representation of the model scale experiment may have resulted in the differences observed in the accuracy between the description of the pitch and roll motion 3 3 2 wave loading on a moored floating wind turbine finally the numerical model is used to simulate the interaction of unidirectional regular waves with the moored oc5 fowt a snapshot of the numerical simulation is presented in fig 16 the numerical model is validated against measurements from the physical experiments the numerical domain set up used in this section is similar to the one described in section 3 3 1 where the main differences are that the length of the domain and the relaxation zones were slightly larger to improve the generation and absorption of waves the total length of the domain is equal to one wave length l 6 4 m and the relaxation zones are equal to a quarter of a wave length the wave generation and absorption technique is similar to the one discussed in section 3 1 as is also presented in section 2 5 as the physical wave maker signal is unknown a fully nonlinear stream function waves fenton 1990 of the same height h 0 14 m and period t 1 71 s is used as in the experiments the wave amplitude is ramped up over 4 wave periods it should be noted that it can be quite difficult to generate regular linear waves in a physical wave tank a slight overshoot of the wave amplitude is observed in the free surface elevation signal of the experimental simulation at t t 4 4 and afterwords a small decrease in the wave amplitude is noticeable see the free surface elevation presented in fig 17 a the motions of the floating structure are mainly in heave and pitch direction as the waves come from a head on position and the floating structure and mooring system are symmetrical in the vertical plane parallel to the wave direction the heave response of the structures cog is presented as a function of time in fig 17b and the vertical displacement relative to the initial position of the floater is normalized by the wave height of the undisturbed incoming waves in terms of the heave motion of the floating structure it can be observed that in general there is a build up in the motion response over the first four wave periods during this build up the numerically determined motion response is higher than the experimental result directly after this build up period the numerically computed heave response slightly reduced after which it stabilizes over the next couple of wave periods in the experimental simulation it takes more time for the heave response to stabilize this could be a result of the irregularities found in the experimental wave signal the pitch motion of the floating structure is presented in fig 17c similar to the heave motion response the pitch motion is seen to build up over the first four wave period again a higher response can be observed in the numerical result however this may be expected as the pitch decay test presented in section 3 3 1 shows that the damping of the pitch motion is lower in the numerical simulation the numerically computed pitch response shows a small decrease after the initial build up after which also the pitch motion stabilizes in the experimental result a higher order motion response can be observed this could indicate that natural pitch frequency of the fowt is exited by the wave overall the numerical simulation has shown to provide stable solution with quite good correspondence with the experimental result 4 conclusions the presented work describes the extensive validation of a state of the art numerical model with respect to complex fluid structure interaction the fully nonlinear navier stokes 6 dof solver is used to successfully reproduce results from benchmark physical model experiments with circular cylinders and a moored fowt the accuracy of the fluid structure interaction in a fixed mesh is evaluated with a comparison against experimental data for the wave loading on a two dimensional fixed horizontal cylinder excellent comparison is achieved in terms of the force profiles of the vertical loading on the cylinder the numerical model is used for the simulations of the free heave decay of a two dimensional horizontal cylinder and good agreement is obtained with both experimental and theoretical results however the standard coupling between the navier stokes and 6 dof solvers is shown to cause stability issues which were observed in the form of force oscillations the use of two stabilizing methods the under relaxation and the predictor corrector method is evaluated both of these stabilizing methods significantly improve the stability of the numerical model however the predictor corrector method is seen to be more effective at eliminating the oscillations in the force profile further validation of the numerical model including the predictor corrector method and the mooring line implementation is done with data from a number of three dimensional physical model tests with the moored oc5 fowt it is concluded from the performed moored heave pitch and roll decay tests that the numerical model is capable of providing stable numerical results that are in good agreement with the physical results especially considering the difficulties involved in evaluating such experiment the numerical model is used to simulate the heave and pitch motions of the moored oc5 fowt subjected to regular incoming waves the results from this numerical simulation compares well with the physical model experiments it is therefore concluded that the model can be used to provide accurate and stable numerical solutions for complex fluid structure interaction using the predictor corrector method for stabilizing the coupling between the navier stokes and 6 dof solvers furthermore the simple mooring line implementation presented in the present work is used to provide results with an high level of correspondence with physical model experiments even though the model has been shown capable of computing highly detailed fluid structure interactions including dynamic motion response of a ridgid structure further improvement and validation is still required multi directional phase focused waves show the potential to introduce larger peak forces than unidirectional waves to extend the spatial and temporal reach of the model to investigate these types of wave loading phenomena a domain decomposition strategy can be applied the fully nonlinear navier stokes 6 dof solver can be coupled with a fully nonlinear potential flow solver oceanwave3d developed by engsig karup et al 2009 this fully parallel one way domain coupling is established and validated by paulsen 2013 and paulsen et al 2014 for fixed mesh problems however the use of this method remains to be validated for the simulation of complex three dimensional fluid structure interactions with moored floating structures for future research it is also important to extend and further validate the mooring line implementation as for design purposes it is important to know the forces in mooring line and anchor points during extreme wave events and the current mooring line implementation only allows for the evaluation of forces in the attachment points on the structure acknowledgements we thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions on the written material furthermore we thank the dutch research institutes deltares ecn marin and nlr who participated in the to2 floating wind

23752,numerical models are becoming a valid supplement and even a substitute to physical model testing for the investigation of fluid structure interaction due to improved methods and a continuous increase in computational power this research presents an extensive validation of a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank for the simulation of complex fluid structure interaction of moored floating structures the validation is carried out against laboratory measurements including recent and unpublished laboratory measurements of the oc5 floating offshore wind turbine subjected to waves the numerical wave tank is based on the navier stokes 6 dof solver interdymfoam provided by the open source cfd toolbox openfoam extended with the wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam and an implementation for restraints of floating structures two methods are evaluated to address the instability issues of the partitioned navier stokes 6 dof solver which are associated with artificial added mass the model has been shown capable of computing detailed fluid structure interactions including dynamic motion response of a rigid structure in waves however instabilities due to numerical added mass is observed and discussed and it is concluded that further research is needed in order to establish a efficient yet stable scheme overall good agreement is achieved between the numerical model and the physical model results keywords floating offshore wind turbines openfoam coupled cfd 6 dof waves2foam mooring lines 1 introduction in recent years a transformation in energy supply from burning of fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources such as solar wind and hydropower is seen in northern europe this change is mainly driven by wind energy and lately also offshore wind energy the increase in wind energy capacity is expected to continue for several decades partly by replacing existing capacity with newer larger and more efficient turbines but for the greater part by the installation of new wind farms pineda et al 2014 offshore wind energy installations are expected to produce approximately 2 9 of the total european union energy demand by 2020 this foreseen growth will move offshore wind energy from an emerging and immature technology to a key component of the energy mix arapogianni et al 2011 current developments of offshore wind are primarily based on bottom mounted foundations and the vast majority of those on monopile foundations gravity based substructures are the second most common foundation type followed by jacket structures however many countries have limited suitable sites in sufficiently shallow water to economically install offshore wind turbines on bottom mounted substructures floating offshore wind turbine fowt concepts are seen as a promising solution to unlock the offshore potential in deeper waters this technology is still at an early stage of development and well validated modelling tools capable of simulating dynamic behaviour are necessary to improve the design of these floating structures arapogianni et al 2013 one of the challenges for fowt at intermediate water depth 50 m h 120 m is optimizing the dynamic behaviour of the mooring system while retaining a limited footprint optimization of mooring systems for semi submersibles and fowt foundations are discussed in robertson et al 2011 brommundt et al 2012 huijs 2015 the common approach for these studies is to use numerical models to analyse different load cases including the effect of wind and wave however not discussed in this paper the presented and validated numerical model is suitable for such analysis and one of the reasons why this research was initialized the international energy agency has facilitated a series of international collaboration projects to improve offshore wind modelling tools these projects aim to verify and validate the accuracy of complex engineering tools through code to code and code to data comparisons jonkman and musial 2010 popko et al 2012 robertson et al 2014b the most recent of these projects is the offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation oc5 this project continues with the improvement of modelling tools based on the dynamic analysis of the deepcwind design koo et al 2014 robertson et al 2014a this semi submersible design features a 5 mw horizontal axis wind turbine with pitch controlled blades developed by the national renewable energy laboratory jonkman et al 2009 popko et al 2012 the simulation tools applied in these research projects are frequency domain potential flow models such as aqwa ansys 2010 and wamit lee and newman 2006 these lower order numerical models are used to determine the frequency dependent added mass and damping coefficients the output from these models is used in a time domain model e g fast jonkman et al 2014 to perform the transient analysis especially for the analysis of a fowt in extreme conditions where these lower order models may be less reliable it could be beneficial to use a higher order numerical model for describing the fluid structure interaction higher order numerical models like computational fluid dynamics cfd combined with 6 dof simulations have been successfully used as a tool in many areas of engineering with cfd models it is possible to use higher order wave models and even accurately simulate wave breaking the major benefit of using a higher order cfd 6 dof model is the capability of solving the fluid structure interaction problem based on the geometry and mass properties of the floating structure without predetermining coefficients however the accuracy of predictions and numerical convergence needs to be validated in order to use cfd 6 dof models as a reliable design tool for floating offshore structures the objective of this research is to establish a well validated fully nonlinear numerical wave tank for the accurate simulation of complex fluid structure interaction of moored floating offshore structures using a higher order cfd 6 dof model based on the opensource cfd toolbox openfoam weller et al 1998 section 2 provides an overview of the numerical models used to set up the numerical wave tank in section 3 the numerical model is validated against theoretical and experimental data this validation consists of three approaches first a wave load and decay case with a two dimensional cylinder are presented where the model is validated against benchmark experimental and theoretical data from dixon et al 1979 ito 1977 and maskell and ursell 1970 secondly the model is used to simulate three dimensional moored decay of a fowt from the oc5 projects lastly the moored fowt is subjected to regular incoming waves both the decay and wave loading cases with the oc5 fowt are validated against physical experiments these tests were carried out in the concept basin at marin and besides focusing on hydrodynamic loading also the effect of the wind turbine controller on the dynamics of the floater was investigated 2 material and methods the multiphase interdymfoam solver of openfoam is a segregated fluid structure interaction solver where the flow dependent motions of a rigid body are obtained by solving the navier stokes and 6 dof equations in a coupled manner the coupled navier stokes 6 dof solver has an unstable nature as discussed in seng 2012 and dunbar et al 2015 in the present work two different methods for stabilizing such a solver are evaluated here the standard interdymfoam solver provided by the opensource cfd toolbox openfoam weller et al 1998 version 2 3 1 is extended with the wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 this combination is referred to as the wavedymfoam solver furthermore an implementation for the restraints of floating structures was developed the structure of this section is as follows first the governing equations for the navier stokes volume of fluid vof solver are presented in section 2 1 the differences between the two stabilizing methods are described in section 2 2 in section 2 3 the restraints implementation is presented the applied boundary conditions are presented in section 2 4 wave generation and absorption with relaxation zones is described in section 2 5 and finally the spatial and temporal discretization is described in section 2 6 2 1 governing equations navier stokes vof the wavedymfoam solver utilizes the two phase incompressible navier stokes equations in combination with a vof surface capturing scheme hirt and nichols 1981 to compute fluid structure interaction the governing equations used in the navier stokes vof solver for conservation of mass and momentum of an incompressible flow of air and water are given by 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u t p g x ρ μ u where x y z is the three dimensional gradient operator u u v w is the velocity field in cartesian coordinates g is the gravitational acceleration and p is pressure in excess of the hydrostatic pressure which relates to the total pressure p by 3 p p ρ g x furthermore the local density ρ and viscosity μ are given by the water volume fraction α consistent with 4 ρ α ρ w a t e r ρ a i r 1 α 5 μ α μ w a t e r μ a i r 1 α where α is zero for air one for water and a mixture of the two for all intermediate values openfoam uses a vof method for tracking the air water interface after obtaining the velocity field by solving equations 1 and 2 for the two phase flow of air and water the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 can be used to advance the α field in time with the following scalar advection equation 6 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 using a standard finite volume approximation for solving the hyperbolic advection equation 6 would lead to significant smearing of the interface this is significantly reduced by the introduction of an interface compression term as discussed in berberović et al 2009 in equation 6 this is the last term of the left hand side the interface compression term is only active in the vicinity of the interface 0 α 1 where its strength is governed by the relative velocity u r it is stressed that even though u r has the dimension of m s it lacks any physical meaning to ensure stability a multi dimensional flux limited scheme mules is used for solving the scalar advection equation 6 2 2 stability of a coupled navier stokes 6 dof solver in order to simulate the flow dependent motion response of a floating structure a partitioned fluid structure interaction model is used here the rigid body motion is obtained by separately solving the navier stokes and 6 dof motion equations for the fluid and the solid for numerical models with a loos coupling between the fluid solver and the motion of the body the discrete time integration may become unstable leading to non physical motion of the object effectively these instabilities appear as a numerical added mass and hence change the behaviour of the structure if the density difference between the fluid and the body becomes smaller the fluid has a larger influence on the motions of the body and numerical simulations are more prone to instabilities the temporal discretization of the numerical simulation was also found to have a significant effect on the stability of the solution thorough discussions on instabilities in partitioned fluid structure interaction models as a result of artificial added mass can be found in the work by causin et al 2005 förster et al 2007 and seng 2012 a common solution to counter the instabilities due to artificial added mass is to implement a tighter coupling in tighter coupled solvers the solutions for both the fluid and the rigid body motion are more converged before the simulation advances to the next time step both piro and maki 2013 and dunbar et al 2015 were able to increase the numerical stability in complex fluid structure interaction problems by introducing a subiteration loop around the navier stokes and 6 dof motion solvers and applying dynamic relaxation to the body force the open source cfd toolbox openfoam version 2 3 1 provides two methods for in increasing numerical stability in fluid structure interaction problems an under relaxation and a predictor corrector method both methods will be evaluated in the present work the difference between the two methods is in the pimple loop which is used to perform time stepping for a comprehensive review of the pimple method the reader is referred to ferziger and peric 2012 2 2 1 under relaxation method the under relaxation method is embedded in the 6 dof loop as can be observed from the algorithm presented at the end of this section in this method an under relaxation factor is applied to the acceleration of the rigid body in the 6 dof loop first the forces and moments on the body are calculated from these forces and moments the displacement and rotation of the body is determined for a certain time step with the under relaxation method the acceleration of the center of gravity cog of the structure is relaxed by an under relaxation factor f a according to 7 a i f a a i 1 f a a i 1 where a i is the under relaxed acceleration of the cog of the structure at the instantaneous time step please note that a can be directional and rotational acceleration furthermore the relaxation of a only starts from the second time step the applied under relaxation method effectively acts as a low pass filter removing high frequency oscillations from the time integration by doing so the stability of the solver is improved however it also introduces a diffusive term to the numerical model which can have a negative effect on the convergence rate of the solution throughout the present research the default under relaxation factor of 0 5 is used this value was found to provide acceptable stability while maintaining sufficient level of accuracy image 1 2 2 2 predictor corrector method the predictor corrector method implements a subiteration loop around the navier stokes and 6 dof solvers as well as under relaxation of the pressure field as can be seen from the algorithm presented at the end of this section the subiteration loop allows the numerical model to make an initial predictor step and one or more corrector steps in the predictor step first the displacement of the body is estimated from the forces acting on the body as is also done in the standard solver the second step is to update the pressure field and recalculate the corrected displacement of the body to smooth the convergence an under relaxation factor f p is applied to the pressure field according to 8 p i f p p i 1 f p p i 1 where p i is the under relaxed pressure field in contrast to the work of dunbar et al 2015 no dynamic relaxation was applied however a constant under relaxation factor f p of 0 5 was applied note that the under relaxation factor for the pressure field is reset to 1 for the last subiteration loop to ensure time consistence throughout the present work the number of subiterations was fixed to 3 image 2 2 3 restraints for moving boundaries two types of restraints for moving boundaries are implemented a linear spring and a simple catenary type mooring line it should be noted that this simple mooring line implementation does not take the interaction with the fluid into account thus it is not influenced by waves or current 2 3 1 linear spring the linear spring is implemented without any damping and the line is given a simple constant stiffness and a rest length force formulation of the spring follows hooke s law the spring is defined such that the force in the spring is zero when the length of the spring is equal to the rest length 2 3 2 mooring line the simple catenary type mooring line implementation is used for anchoring a floating structure to the seabed where the shape and force formulations are adopted from krenk 2001 it should be noted that a flat horizontal seabed is assumed in the presented mooring line implementation three different mooring line states are defined simple state resting state and hanging state see fig 1 2 3 2 1 simple state in the simple state see fig 1a the mooring line is completely in suspension i e the anchor point p 0 is equal to the touchdown point p t the formulation follows the restoring force in a catenary line between two attachment points where the distance between the attachment points is less than the length of the line krenk 2001 the line cannot break while the distance between the connected objects can exceed the defined length of the line beyond this defined length the line is treated as a linear spring where the stiffness of the line is based on the magnitude of the restraining force in the catenary line at the limit of its length 2 3 2 2 resting state the resting state see fig 1b is the mooring line state where the floating structure is so close to the anchor point that a part of the catenary line is resting on the sea bed the remainder of the cable will behave as a catenary line as defined in the simple state the touchdown point p t is evaluated by finding the resting length of the line that ensures that the slope of the line at the touchdown point is horizontal krenk 2001 2 3 2 3 hanging state the hanging state is defined as the state where the floating object is so close to the anchor point that the piecewise linear configuration of the mooring line is shorter than the length of the mooring line see fig 1c only a vertical force acts in the attachment point which is equal to the weight of the suspended part of the line 2 4 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations of the navier stokes vof solver boundary conditions are specified for all surfaces in the numerical domain before going into the allocation of particular boundary conditions the general denomination of the boundary surfaces is given in a schematic representation of the numerical domain see fig 2 it should be noted that a structure will be present inside the numerical domain at the inlet and outlet boundary surfaces the velocities u and the α field are given by a closed form analytic wave theory this technique works well and allows minimisation of the start up time by initialising the free surface with the incident wave profile at the surface of the body a slip condition is applied which means that the viscous boundary layer near the body is not resolved however the governing equations still contains the effect of viscosity and turbulence generation due to internal stresses and the free surface motion near the structure i e viscous effects due to wave breaking or splashing near the structure are included the viscous boundary layer is not resolved as this requires the usage of a turbulence model which often influences the evolution of the free surface brown et al 2014 development of turbulence models which can model a structural boundary layer without influencing the propagation of the free surface is on going research the viscous boundary layer at the seabed is neglected since typically the propagation of waves with a cfd solver is limited to only a couple of wave lengths and in such simulations the influence of the seabed on the wave dissipation is small a slip condition is applied to the side walls of the three dimensional numerical wave tank as presented in section 3 3 while for the two dimensional computations as presented in section 3 1 and 3 2 an empty condition was applied to the front and back walls at the atmosphere boundary layer of the numerical domain an atmospheric boundary condition is applied for the velocity u and the α field this means that air and water are allowed to leave the numerical domain while only air is allowed to flow back in furthermore the total pressure at the atmosphere boundary is equal to zero 2 5 relaxation zones in present work the wave generation toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 was used to implement relaxation zones in the numerical domain for the validation cases without incoming waves as presented in section 3 2 and 3 3 1 relaxation zones are implemented at the in and outlet of the domain to absorb waves generated by the structure s motion the relaxation zones for the two validation cases where a structure is subjected to incoming waves as presented in section 3 1 and 3 3 2 are set up to generate a continuous propagating wave the relaxation zone at the inlet is used to generate the incoming waves while the relaxation zone at the outlet is set up to produce the undisturbed incoming wave profile thus minimizing reflections from the inlet and outlet boundary layers see bruinsma 2016 for a more detailed description of this particular relaxation zone set up as the physical wave maker signal is unknown an exact reproduction of hydrodynamic conditions used in the various benchmark cases is not possible instead fully nonlinear stream function waves fenton 1990 of the required height and period are used 2 6 spatial and temporal discretization the numerical domains used in this research are created using the blockmesh and snappyhexmesh utilities provided by openfoam the numerical wave tank is formed as a box domain which is generated with blockmesh and snappyhexmesh is used to sculpt the surface boundary of the structure inside the mesh generation of the structure surface boundary is done by local refinement and reconstruction of cells where 2 2 and 4 4 levels of refinement were used for the two and three dimensional domains this local refinement allows for a high resolution interface while keeping the total number of computational cells relatively low the spatial discretization of the numerical domains is based on the cell size next to the structure surface boundary which in turn is defined by the number of points per cylinder diameter p p c d as 9 δ d p p c d this means that for the two dimensional cases the cells closest to the structure surface boundary have a dimension equal to the number of p p c d whereas the cells outside the refinement zone are 4 times as large for the temporal discretization i e determining the time step of the numerical simulations the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is used throughout the present research a courant number equal to 0 25 is applied 3 results this section presents the results of the benchmark cases performed to validate the numerical model the first case presented in section 3 1 regards the simulation of wave loading on a fixed partially submerged horizontal cylinder in a two dimensional fixed mesh here the numerical results are compared against experimental data from dixon et al 1979 in section 3 2 the two stabilizing methods for the navier stokes 6 dof coupling are evaluated on the basis of the heave decay of a free floating horizontal cylinder in a two dimensional numerical domain with a dynamic mesh where the numerical result is compared to theoretical work by maskell and ursell 1970 and experimental work by ito 1977 please note that for these two validation cases the application of a 2d domain was part of the validation and since there is good agreement with the experimental results the 2d approach is justified in section 3 3 the numerical model is validated with a number of three dimensional physical model tests with the moored oc5 fowt first the moored heave pitch and roll decay tests are evaluated in section 3 3 1 and finally the floating structure is subjected to unidirectional regular waves the results from this numerical simulation are presented in section 3 3 2 3 1 flow induced pressures on a fixed body in this first validation case the numerical model is used to reproduce results from the wave loading experiments from the work of dixon et al 1979 these simulations are performed to determine whether the navier stokes solver is capable of accurately simulating fluid structure interaction so without the additional complexities of moving meshes and the coupling of the navier stokes and 6 dof solvers the work by dixon et al 1979 presents a series of physical experiments where vertical and horizontal forces on a fixed horizontal cylinder induced by regular waves were determined for various wave amplitudes and levels of cylinder submergence it was discovered that the cylinder s varying buoyancy can play an equally large role as the inertial force in the resultant vertical force in particular cases this led to negative vertical force profiles which act at twice the wave frequency in these cases the inertial coefficient c m in morison s equation becomes negative by introducing a varying volume and buoyancy term to morison s equation dixon et al were able to reformulate the analytical description thus achieving better correspondence with the experimental results table 2 shows a selection of the experimental and theoretical results of dixon et al for various relative wave amplitudes and a constant submergence depth of the cylinder d equal to zero here d is measured from the cylinders centroid to the still water level i e the cylinder is half submerged the relative wave amplitude a is the ratio of the wave amplitude a to the cylinder diameter d for the comparison of the various results the dimensionless root mean square rms vertical force is calculated using 10 f r m s 1 n k 1 n f k 2 where f r m s is the rms force and f k the relative vertical force component at each time step which is the total vertical force on the cylinder divided by the buoyancy force of the totally submerged cylinder fig 3 shows a schematic representation of the numerical domain used for the two dimensional cases presented in this section and section 3 2 for this section the domain dimensions are l 4 λ d 0 5 m a 0 25 m d 0 1 m and d 0 0 m the boundary conditions relaxation zones and numerical discretization are defined according to the two dimensional set up described in section 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 to verify grid independence a grid sensitivity analysis is carried out for one of the wave loading cases the applied spatial discretizations are presented in table 1 in fig 4 the numerical results for the vertical force on the cylinder are presented along with the experimental solutions from dixon et al 1979 it can be observed that the numerical solution is converging with increasing grid resolution please note that since the cfl condition is used to determine the time step an increase in the spatial resolution also results in an increase in the temporal resolution the highest resolution was selected for all further simulations in this section in order to ensure a high level of convergence five simulations are performed with a constant relative axis depth d 0 0 while the relative amplitude of the wave is varying from 0 1 to 0 5 for all simulations the rms force f r m s is computed and these are presented in table 2 where the error with respect to the experimental data from dixon et al 1979 is also presented it can be observed that the numerically computed rms forces are slightly underestimating the experimental data and the offset with the experimental rms force increases for the higher amplitude waves this underestimation could be a result of not resolving the viscous boundary layer near the body and this is an interesting topic for future research the rms forces show that the numerical model is able to determine the general forcing over a single wave period however for a more detailed evaluation of the accuracy of the numerical model the force profiles are presented in fig 5 it may be observed that for the smaller amplitude waves both the theoretical and numerical forcing show good correspondence with the experimental data however for relative amplitudes larger than 0 2 the theoretical formulation lacks accuracy in the loading caused by the wave crest passing the cylinder much better consensus is achieved between the experimental data and the numerical results the force profiles are in general better aligned and especially the prediction of the peak forces caused by the passing wave crest is more in line with the experimental results overall it may be concluded that the navier stokes solver was able to accurately simulate the wave loading on a fixed horizontal cylinder 3 2 flow induced motions of a free floating body from section 3 1 it follows that the numerical wave tank can be used to accurately calculate flow induced pressures on a fixed body in the present section the ability of the numerical wave tank to simulate flow induced motions of a free floating two dimensional horizontal cylinder is evaluated as described in section 2 2 artificial added mass may cause instabilities in loosely coupled partitioned solvers this section explores whether the under relaxation and predictor corrector method can improve the stability of the navier stokes 6 dof solver while maintaining a high level of accuracy the validation is performed on a benchmark case of the heave decay of a free floating horizontal cylinder with theoretical results from maskell and ursell 1970 and experimental results from ito 1977 in their work maskell and ursell 1970 present a theoretical formulation for the decay of heave motion of a free floating horizontal cylinder this theory was later validated by experimental work from ito 1977 the numerical domain set up for the simulation of the heaving cylinder is similar to the one used for the validation cases presented in section 3 1 a schematic representation is presented in fig 3 where l 6 m d 1 24 m a 0 2 m and d 0 1524 m the initial vertical displacement of the cylinders cog with respect to the still water level is equal to one sixth of the cylinder diameter or d 0 0254 m relaxation zones with a length of 1 m are implemented at both ends of the domain to absorb waves generated by the heaving cylinder the boundary layer conditions relaxation zones and numerical discretization are defined according to the two dimensional set up described in section 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 the vertical displacement of a the cylinder s cog relative to the still water level is presented in fig 6 please note that the cylinder density of the cylinder is half that of the fluid and that the cylinder is half submerged in the equilibrium the cylinder was dropped from an initial displacement of d 0 0254 m note that the initial velocity of the cylinder is equal to zero the spatial discretization of the computational domain is presented in table 3 where the grid resolution of 40 p p c d is adopted from the grid sensitivity study of the wave loading simulation discussed in section 3 1 overall it can be concluded from the transient heave responses presented in fig 6 that in spite of the small differences introduced by different stabilizing methods the numerical solver is able to provide an accurate solution to the physical problem from the error in the period and amplitude of the first peak response in the cylinder s transient motion presented in table 4 it can be observed that both transient motions of the simulations without a stabilizer and with the under relaxation method show slight overestimations of amplitude while result obtained with the predictor corrector method is found to be in better correspondence with the experimental result from ito 1977 to examine the reliability of the solver in terms of stability the velocity and force profiles are evaluated fig 7 presents the normalized vertical velocity of the cylinder s cog and in fig 8 the vertical force on the cylinder is presented oscillation in the velocity and force profiles are a sign of instabilities in the numerical model no significant disturbances could be observed in the velocity profiles of the three numerical simulations while in the force profiles clear disturbances can be observed for the un stabilized numerical simulation severe oscillations start to appear as the maximum negative displacement is reached at around t g d 4 when the under relaxation method is applied it can be seen that the force profile stabilizes to some degree however some oscillations and a number of large force spikes can still be observed it may be observed that the predictor corrector method provides the most stability as only minor oscillations and no force spikes are visible in the resulting force profile it should be noted that the added stability comes at a price for the predictor corrector method the execution time increases due to the additional iteration loops and for the under relaxation method the accuracy of the solution decreases as a result of under relaxation of the acceleration while time stepping furthermore the execution time is slightly increased with respect to the unstabilized simulation the predictor corrector method was selected for all further computations because of its high level of accuracy and stability for engineering purposes it might in some cases be more useful to apply the under relaxation method as decent result are obtained at lower computational cost 3 3 flow induced motions of a moored floating wind turbine from section 3 2 it follows that the numerical wave tank can be used to accurately calculate flow induced motions of a free floating two dimensional horizontal cylinder and that the numerical stability can be improved significantly by using the predictor corrector method described in section 2 2 2 the present section evaluates the capability of the numerical wave tank to simulate the motions of a moored three dimensional floating body the aim of this section is to validate the numerical model against physical experiments with the generic oc5 fowt that were performed in the concept basin at marin these scale model tests were part of the to2 floating wind research project which was carried out by dutch research institutes deltares ecn marin and nlr see bruinsma 2016 first a series of three simulations of moored decay tests is presented in section 3 3 1 after which the simulation of a wave loading test is evaluated in section 3 3 2 the wave tank used for the physical experiments is depicted in fig 9 note that a 1 50 froude scaling is applied and that unless otherwise stated all dimensions and properties are presented in model scale due to the limited width of the physical wave tank the oc5 s original three line spread mooring system could not be installed instead the mooring system consisted of a front and back mooring line in combination with two horizontal linear springs which were designed so that restoring properties of the system would be close to those of the original three line system a schematic representation of the numerical domain used for the validation cases in this section is presented in fig 10 for the simulation of heave pitch and roll decay presented in section 3 3 1 the length l is equal to 4 0 m as is the width of the physical domain and the height is equal to 5 0 m of which 4 0 m is the water depth relaxation zones with a length of 1 m are implemented at both ends of the domain to absorb waves generated by the motions of the floating structure for the simulation of the wave loading on the oc5 fowt presented in section 3 3 2 the length of the domain is slightly larger to allow for more lateral movement of the floating structure the total length of the domain is equal to one wave length l 6 4 m and the relaxation zones used for the generation and absorption of waves are equal to a quarter of a wave length as the physical wave maker signal is unknown an exact reproduction of the experiments is not possible instead fully nonlinear stream function waves of the same height h 0 14 m and period t 1 71 s is used fenton 1990 the boundary layer conditions relaxation zones and numerical discretization are defined according to the descriptions in section 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 it may be noted that the length of the numerical domain is much smaller than that of the physical wave tank this is possible due to the simple mooring line implementation see section 2 3 2 which is simulated as a force in the attachment points on the fowt and thereby they do not limit the domain size this also means that although the adjusted mooring system is used the numerical simulation could be performed equally well with the original oc5 three line spread mooring system furthermore the sub structure turbine tower nacelle and blades are considered as one rigid body with a single moment of inertia and cog since mainly the fluid structure interaction is considered only the sub structure is modelled in the numerical domain 3 3 1 decay tests with a moored floating wind turbine for all the heave pitch and roll simulations the initial position of the sub structure is modelled in the base mesh the physical properties of the floating wind turbine and the mooring system are presented in table 5 the pre tension in the horizontal springs in the physical mooring system is not measured therefore marin provided a best estimate pre tension of 0 256 n for a more detailed discussion on the numerical set up and the physical properties of the floating structure and mooring system the reader is referred to bruinsma 2016 to verify grid independence a grid sensitivity analysis is carried out on the heave decay test with the moored fowt the applied spatial discretizations are presented in table 6 in fig 11 the numerical results for the vertical displacement of the cog of the fowt are presented along with the results from the physical model tests it can be observed that the transient response of the fowt is converging with increasing spatial and temporal resolution it may be argued that the lowest resolution of 5 p p c d is not high enough to resolve the challenging physics of this heave decay test however for the higher resolution the numerical solution matches the experimental result quite well this is especially true for the first two heave periods after which the numerical and experimental results start to disagree more significantly it may be noted that in the experimental results a slight increase in the downward amplitude of the heave displacement can be observed at t t 2 5 the source is not explained however it is speculated that it is related to the mooring system in particular to the horizontal springs to evaluate the simulation in terms of the numerical stability as was done for the two dimensional decaying cylinder the vertical velocity of the cog of the floating structure and vertical force on the floating structure are presented in figs 12 and 13 respectively from these figures it may be concluded that as only minor disturbances can be observed in the force profiles the predictor corrector method is able to provide a stable solution to keep the computational demand relatively low the spatial resolution of 10 p p c d is selected for all further computations since the obtained accuracy with respect to the experimental solution was seen to be in the order of one percent both in term of amplitude and period see table 7 where the error after one heave period is presented the numerical and experimental results of the moored pitch decay test are presented in fig 14 to isolate the pitch rotation the numerical model was restricted to the pitch rotation while it was free to translate in the x y and z direction it may be observed that the damping of the pitch motion is slightly lower in the numerical simulation resulting in a larger response amplitude with respect to the experimental solution an overestimation of approximately 18 per cent was observed for the first response amplitude presented in table 7 on the other hand the period of the pitch decay motion is slightly lower than the experimental result the numerical and experimental results of the moored roll decay test are presented in fig 15 it can be observed that an excellent correspondence with the experimental result was achieved as only small differences are observed in terms of amplitude and period of the pitch response see table 7 note that the experimental roll angle shows a irregularity at negative roll angles so when the floater is leaning to port side although this abnormality does not seem to have a significant influence on the general progression of the roll signal it should be noted that the interpretation of these results needs to be done with great care it was observed that the horizontal springs used in the mooring system were at times hitting the water surface when they became slack this unintended interaction with the water is not modelled in the numerical simulation it is argued that these and other assumptions with respect to the numerical representation of the model scale experiment may have resulted in the differences observed in the accuracy between the description of the pitch and roll motion 3 3 2 wave loading on a moored floating wind turbine finally the numerical model is used to simulate the interaction of unidirectional regular waves with the moored oc5 fowt a snapshot of the numerical simulation is presented in fig 16 the numerical model is validated against measurements from the physical experiments the numerical domain set up used in this section is similar to the one described in section 3 3 1 where the main differences are that the length of the domain and the relaxation zones were slightly larger to improve the generation and absorption of waves the total length of the domain is equal to one wave length l 6 4 m and the relaxation zones are equal to a quarter of a wave length the wave generation and absorption technique is similar to the one discussed in section 3 1 as is also presented in section 2 5 as the physical wave maker signal is unknown a fully nonlinear stream function waves fenton 1990 of the same height h 0 14 m and period t 1 71 s is used as in the experiments the wave amplitude is ramped up over 4 wave periods it should be noted that it can be quite difficult to generate regular linear waves in a physical wave tank a slight overshoot of the wave amplitude is observed in the free surface elevation signal of the experimental simulation at t t 4 4 and afterwords a small decrease in the wave amplitude is noticeable see the free surface elevation presented in fig 17 a the motions of the floating structure are mainly in heave and pitch direction as the waves come from a head on position and the floating structure and mooring system are symmetrical in the vertical plane parallel to the wave direction the heave response of the structures cog is presented as a function of time in fig 17b and the vertical displacement relative to the initial position of the floater is normalized by the wave height of the undisturbed incoming waves in terms of the heave motion of the floating structure it can be observed that in general there is a build up in the motion response over the first four wave periods during this build up the numerically determined motion response is higher than the experimental result directly after this build up period the numerically computed heave response slightly reduced after which it stabilizes over the next couple of wave periods in the experimental simulation it takes more time for the heave response to stabilize this could be a result of the irregularities found in the experimental wave signal the pitch motion of the floating structure is presented in fig 17c similar to the heave motion response the pitch motion is seen to build up over the first four wave period again a higher response can be observed in the numerical result however this may be expected as the pitch decay test presented in section 3 3 1 shows that the damping of the pitch motion is lower in the numerical simulation the numerically computed pitch response shows a small decrease after the initial build up after which also the pitch motion stabilizes in the experimental result a higher order motion response can be observed this could indicate that natural pitch frequency of the fowt is exited by the wave overall the numerical simulation has shown to provide stable solution with quite good correspondence with the experimental result 4 conclusions the presented work describes the extensive validation of a state of the art numerical model with respect to complex fluid structure interaction the fully nonlinear navier stokes 6 dof solver is used to successfully reproduce results from benchmark physical model experiments with circular cylinders and a moored fowt the accuracy of the fluid structure interaction in a fixed mesh is evaluated with a comparison against experimental data for the wave loading on a two dimensional fixed horizontal cylinder excellent comparison is achieved in terms of the force profiles of the vertical loading on the cylinder the numerical model is used for the simulations of the free heave decay of a two dimensional horizontal cylinder and good agreement is obtained with both experimental and theoretical results however the standard coupling between the navier stokes and 6 dof solvers is shown to cause stability issues which were observed in the form of force oscillations the use of two stabilizing methods the under relaxation and the predictor corrector method is evaluated both of these stabilizing methods significantly improve the stability of the numerical model however the predictor corrector method is seen to be more effective at eliminating the oscillations in the force profile further validation of the numerical model including the predictor corrector method and the mooring line implementation is done with data from a number of three dimensional physical model tests with the moored oc5 fowt it is concluded from the performed moored heave pitch and roll decay tests that the numerical model is capable of providing stable numerical results that are in good agreement with the physical results especially considering the difficulties involved in evaluating such experiment the numerical model is used to simulate the heave and pitch motions of the moored oc5 fowt subjected to regular incoming waves the results from this numerical simulation compares well with the physical model experiments it is therefore concluded that the model can be used to provide accurate and stable numerical solutions for complex fluid structure interaction using the predictor corrector method for stabilizing the coupling between the navier stokes and 6 dof solvers furthermore the simple mooring line implementation presented in the present work is used to provide results with an high level of correspondence with physical model experiments even though the model has been shown capable of computing highly detailed fluid structure interactions including dynamic motion response of a ridgid structure further improvement and validation is still required multi directional phase focused waves show the potential to introduce larger peak forces than unidirectional waves to extend the spatial and temporal reach of the model to investigate these types of wave loading phenomena a domain decomposition strategy can be applied the fully nonlinear navier stokes 6 dof solver can be coupled with a fully nonlinear potential flow solver oceanwave3d developed by engsig karup et al 2009 this fully parallel one way domain coupling is established and validated by paulsen 2013 and paulsen et al 2014 for fixed mesh problems however the use of this method remains to be validated for the simulation of complex three dimensional fluid structure interactions with moored floating structures for future research it is also important to extend and further validate the mooring line implementation as for design purposes it is important to know the forces in mooring line and anchor points during extreme wave events and the current mooring line implementation only allows for the evaluation of forces in the attachment points on the structure acknowledgements we thank the anonymous

23753,this paper compares the performance of different grid based and grid free modelling approaches to predict the tip vortex evolution in both near and far wing wake fields the grid based methods cover different turbulence modelling approaches adaptive mesh refinement and the adaptive vorticity confinement vc method using the openfoam code computational vortex method cvm coupled with the openfoam simulation of the near field is utilised to properly predict the tip vortex behaviour in the far field all simulation results are compared to results of the wind tunnel experiments conducted by devenport et al 1996 the comparison is based on the analysis of the vortex core parameters the core size the peak tangential velocity and the axial velocity deficit additionally the results are compared with another numerical study by wells 2009 2010 it turns out that turbulence modelling plays an important role since simple one and two equation models overpredict the turbulence intensity in the vortex core resulting in its fast decay the potential of the adaptive vc method depends on the underlying turbulence model grid free vortex method shows a good potential to improve the simulation accuracy keywords tip vortex grid free vortex method turbulence modelling adaptive mesh refinement adaptive vorticity confinement 1 introduction wing tip vortices decay slowly and extend far downstream in the wake strong tip vortices with a large lifetime can be observed in many engineering applications with rotating lifting surfaces in marine engineering the most important application is the marine propeller hydrodynamics in case of submerged ship propellers tip vortex cavitation may create noise and lead to erosion of the rudder the noise prediction is of big importance because it disturbs animals like whales and reduces comfort of people on board ship the propeller slipstream including the tip vortices prescribes the flow at the rudder and therewith influences the rudder forces lifting foils are used in shipbuilding to damp ship roll motions and for the creation of the dynamic lift on hydrofoil ships in these cases the trailing tip vortices may influence the inflow of the propeller or foils moving downstream in the wake a further important area where tip vortices play a dominant role is the wake of aircraft the evolution of the tip vortices of landing and starting aircraft has been extensively studied with respect to the hazard of wake encounter by other craft flying close to the big one also for wing in ground wig effect vehicles the wake and tip vortex evolution has a strong influence on the flight stability see e g kornev and matveev 2003 rozhdestvensky 2006 the prediction of tip vortices with computational fluid dynamics cfd is a challenge as inherent artificial dissipation effects lead to an unphysically strong decay of the vortices the artificial dissipation or numerical diffusion results from numerical errors due to the discretisation and turbulence modelling feder and abdel maksoud 2016b provide further information on this topic in conjunction with the numerical prediction of tip vortices an accurate numerical prediction of the tip vortex evolution is limited by a huge amount of necessary computational resources and imperfection of available mathematical models several numerical and experimental studies deal with the evolution of tip vortices and the difficulties concerning their prediction gerz holzäpfel and misaka worked extensively on the numerical prediction of tip vortices within the wake of aircraft see e g gerz et al 2002 holzäpfel et al 2003 misaka et al 2013 and stephan et al 2014 or chow et al 1994 their approach is usually based on the application of large eddy simulations les targeting to predict the vortex decay of aircraft including the influence of the ground effect on the tip vortices and their evolution in the atmospheric boundary layer several studies deal with the analysis of tip vortex evolution in the near field so up to a few chord lengths downstream an interesting study is published by samal et al 2013 who investigated the flow structure of a wing tip vortex behind a sweptback and tapered naca 0015 wing at r e 181000 their simulation results showed a good agreement with experimental results further studies by nash at et al 2013 have been conducted to analyse the wake in the near field of a naca 0012 wing this paper focuses on grid based and grid free methods to capture the details of vortices especially further downstream after the vortex has rolled up and started to decay kornev and abbas 2016 studied cfd performance to predict the near vortex field in the wake of an oscillating wing at distances of one and half chords from the trailing edge they showed a good agreement with experimental results of birch and lee 2005 experimental investigations of wing tip vortices in wind tunnels confirm that tip vortices extend for long distances in the wake devenport et al 1996 carried out an extensive study of a tip vortex trailing from a naca 0012 wing until 30 chord lengths downstream of the wing they present experimental data of turbulence properties as well as the tangential and axial velocities in the vicinity of the vortex core the quality of the experimental data is superior to many other investigations because they were corrected for the wandering of the tip vortex core caused by instability of wind tunnel flow and possible wing vibration wells published a numerical study for the devenport test case and analysed the performance of different turbulence models see wells 2009 wells et al 2010 in the near field the accuracy of the simulation results using a reynolds stress turbulence model is very good further downstream wells observes excessive diffusion of the tip vortex which is not supported by experimental results within this study different grid based and grid free simulation approaches are validated for prediction of the tip vortex evolution using the devenport test case according to the measurements of devenport et al 1996 the flow in the vicinity of the vortex core is laminar utilisation of standard reynolds averaged navier stokes rans turbulence models based on boussinesq approach leads to an overprediction of the turbulence viscosity within the vortex core which in turn results in its increased decay rate as a remedy of this disadvantage several improved turbulence models validated in this paper were proposed by different authors curvature corrections for rans models hybrid rans les methods and reynolds stress transport models the artificial numerical viscosity can be reduced by adaptive mesh refinement amr and the adaptive vorticity confinement vc methods which are also in the focus of this paper the first approach refines the mesh in the vicinity of the vortex core and the second approach introduces a momentum source term which should counteract the numerical diffusion the vc method was developed by steinhoff and colleagues in 1992 steinhoff et al 1992 steinhoff and underhill 1994 and steinhoff et al 2005 and further developed by several authors it overcomes the significant deficiency of the previous vc formulations as it lacks the necessity of a user defined forcing coefficient recent applications of the vc method showed its potential for ship propeller hydrodynamics see e g zhang et al 2014 another work to be mentioned here is presented by o regan et al see o regan et al 2016 who demonstrated that the potential of vc is larger in conjunction with les turbulence modelling than with any urans approach this behaviour was observed also by feder and abdel maksoud in feder and abdel maksoud 2016a for the adaptive vc method 2 test case this study targets to validate cfd models using the benchmark test case thoroughly studied in wind tunnel measurements presented in devenport et al 1996 the basic setup of the experiment is shown in fig 1 during the experiment the evolution of a tip vortex generated by a rectangular wing with the naca 0012 profile was studied the wing with a blunt tip has the following dimensions a span of 0 879 m and a chord length of c 0 203 m the wind tunnel has a quadratic test section of 1 83 m width and 7 33 m length devenport et al provide the most extensive data for the reynolds number r e 530000 based on the chord length and for 5 angle of attack there the vortex is tracked downstream until 30 chord lengths behind the leading edge of the wing experimental data are provided for axial and tangential velocity profiles through the vortex core and for turbulence properties e g the turbulent kinetic energy the target of the simulation approaches used in this paper is to predict the evolution of tip vortices until large distances downstream for this purpose the test case of devenport et al is more informative than other experiments at which the tip vortices are tracked only in the near wake of wings besides another advantage of this wind tunnel data is the proper correction for the vortex wandering motion this slow side to side movement is usually observed for wind tunnel generated tip vortices without a proper correction of this effect the experimental data would suggest an increased vortex decay the way how the experimental data is corrected is presented in details in devenport et al 1996 feder and abdel maksoud 2016b did not observe wandering within a similar previous numerical study this observation was based on the hexpress mesh with 6 0 m cells and the sa ddes turbulence model the solver settings were equal to the ones used for the transient simulations within this study as no wandering was observed within the simulations the corresponding correction is not necessary the postprocessing of the simulation results will be presented in section 4 1 3 numerical setup the simulations are conducted with openfoam see weller et al 1998 on grids with hexahedral cells generated with hexpress and structured grids generated with ansys icem cfd the coordinate system is set according to devenport et al 1996 and displayed in fig 2 a the origin is placed at the leading edge on the wing tip the x axis points downstream and the y axis points along the wing the computational domain is shown in fig 2a the inlet boundary is located at x c 7 4 whereas the outlet at x c 46 7 the boundaries with y and z normals denote the walls of the wind tunnel s test section the size of the domain s cross section corresponds to the measuring section of the wind tunnel and the location of the wing in the cross section is identical to the experimental one 3 1 grids 3 1 1 hexpress low re number grid the low reynolds number mesh was generated with hexpress version 5 1 the turbulent boundary layer is well resolved up to the viscous sublayer fig 2a shows the medium mesh at certain boundaries an advantage of the hexpress mesh is the possibility to attain a homogeneous cell size with a desired refinement level in the vicinity of the vortex core the cell size around the tip vortex in the measurement section x c 5 30 is chosen to obtain about eight cells inside the mean measured core diameter the total cell number is approximately 6 0 m since the first cell height is small 2 10 5 m which yields y 1 no wall functions are applied within the simulation a few cell about 20 layers are used within the boundary layer this mesh was also used within the previous studies by feder and abdel maksoud on the devenport test case there the influence of static mesh refinement was investigated 3 1 2 icem high re number grid three meshes of different resolutions are generated in ansys icem cfd the first mesh with 2 7 million of cells is initially coarse in the whole computational domain while gets a little finer in the regions close to the wing see fig 3 by the use of the special routine of openfoam two boxes are introduced for static refinement within the vortex core the first box extends from the leading edge to x c 10 distance while the second one extends further to x c 20 in all the three directions each cell in the first box is refined with the factor of two while this factor in the second box is four this results in intermediate fine 7 2 million mesh grid further refining the 7 2 million mesh in both boxes by doubling the cell number in all three directions results in the finest mesh of 42 2 million cells see fig 4 the non dimensional position of the first node y is varied between 5 and 40 on the wing for all grids since the refinement is done only in the zone around the tip vortex thus the inner part of the boundary is not resolved and these grids can be ascribed to the so called high re number grids in this the application of wall functions is necessary in what follows for the sake of brevity the grids are referred to as hexpress and icem grids 3 2 improvement of grid resolution using adaptive mesh refinement adaptive mesh refinement amr allows one to refine the grid locally within the vortex core using e g the q criterion for instance such a technology developed by jasak and tukovic 2010 is based on the computed numerical error gradients in the flow each mesh cell was split into two and four subcells in all three directions referring them further as to q1 and q2 refinement respectively this method was applied on the icem meshes described above and adapted at each time step buffering of the mesh was also introduced which takes into account the refinement layers of the neighbours of the cells which are set for refinement the mesh gets refined only in the region of the tip vortex as shown see fig 5 amr was applied only to simulations with curvature corrected turbulence models 3 3 solver settings and turbulence models several simulations summarised in table 1 were carried out the following paragraphs provide further detailed information on the used numerical methods and models in case of the unsteady simulations the flow passed the measurement domain δ x 30 c thirty times the chordlength at least twice and for most cases 3 5 times for each case the simulation was stopped when the mean vortex flow converged rans and urans models several different turbulence models are compared with the same solver settings the following list gives an overview one equation turbulence model spalart allmaras presented by spalart and allmaras 1994 termed sa one equation turbulence model spalart allmaras with curvature correction presented by shur et al 2000 termed sa cc two equation turbulence model k ω sst presented by menter et al 2003a termed sst two equation turbulence model k ω sst with curvature correction presented by smirnov and menter 2009 termed sst cc launder reece rodi reynolds stress turbulence model presented by launder et al termed lrr for the above rans simulations following settings were taken the spatial discretisation of the convective term is performed using the filtered linear scheme implemented in openfoam this scheme calculates the face values using blending of linear interpolation with a particular amount of upwind depending on the ratio of the background in cell gradient and face gradient the amount of upwind is limited to 30 the laplacian term was discretised using the linear scheme with explicit non orthogonal correction pressure gradient was reconstructed using linear scheme based on the green gauss theorem the equations for k and ω were discretised in the same manner except the convective term for which a tvd scheme with sweby flux limiter was applied without turbulence modelling as mentioned above one of a serious disadvantages of turbulence models which leads to a fast vortex decay is the overprediction of the turbulence intensity in the vicinity of the tip vortex core to analyse this issues some simulations are carried out without turbulence modelling i e the unsteady navier stokes equations are solved this can be classified as an underresolved very large eddy simulation vles without a sub grid model termed here w o in case of the 42 m icem mesh the simulation was carried out in an unsteady mode using the piso algorithm running four times for pressure correction loop to reach convergence time derivatives discretisation has been done using the backward difference scheme and the maximum courant number was approximately ten considering the hexpress mesh the time derivatives were discretised like for the hybrid rans les models see tab 1 for an overview of settings hybrid rans les models several hybrid turbulence models termed detached eddy simulation des are used to account for the typical deficiency of standard rans models which overpredict the turbulence viscosity in the vortex core this deficiency can be overcome if les is applied in the vicinity of the tip vortex downstream of the wing the des models are based on the one equation spalart allmaras sa see spalart and allmaras 1994 and the two equation k ω sst sst see menter and esch 2001 turbulence models spalart allmaras delayed des presented by spalart et al 2006 termed sa ddes spalart allmaras improved delayed des presented by shur et al 2008 termed sa iddes k ω sst delayed des presented by gritskevich et al 2012 termed sst ddes k ω sst improved delayed des presented by gritskevich et al 2012 termed sst iddes all simulations with hybrid turbulence models are conducted with the pimplefoam solver a large time step transient solver using the piso and the simple algorithms see e g ferziger and perić 2002 the relaxation factor is set to 0 3 for all variables during each time step the simple algorithm is run 20 times with one pressure correction loop each to reach convergence for the high maximum courant number of approximately 160 the convection term of the momentum equation is discretised with a linear upwind discretisation scheme luds the time is discretised using the first order implicit euler scheme 3 4 adaptive vorticity confinement the approach vorticity confinement vc describes methods which reinforce vortices and therewith act against the dissipation due to numerical errors within all vc methods an artificial source term s is introduced into the momentum conservation equations e g for incompressible flow 1 u t u u 1 ρ p ν δ u s with the velocity u the density ρ the pressure p and the kinematic viscosity ν for different vc methods s can be generalised to 2 s ε s the proportionality factor unit m s controls the strength of the source term the vector s unit 1 s is defined by 3 s ω ω ω where ω is the vorticity thus s points along vorticity magnitude contour lines different formulations of the vector s are not considered in this study because firstly the adaptive vc method which will be evaluated in this paper uses the presented formulation and secondly the disadvantages listed subsequently refer to ε and cannot be compensated by another choice of s the influence of the vc source term was described smartly by hahn and iaccarino 2009 considering an axisymmetric vortex tube where the vector ω points outward from the vortex centre the source term convects vorticity back toward the vortex centre as it diffuses outward the original vc technique was proposed by steinhoff and colleagues in 1992 steinhoff et al 1992 steinhoff and underhill 1994 and steinhoff et al 2005 the factor was set to a user defined value which is constant over the domain several authors improved this method including the local grid size and vortical fields like the helicity in the calculation of the source term this improves the results of vc but still there is no universal approach to determine the appropriate value of the user defined factor the trial and error approach to find the appropriate value is time consuming and not reliable a wrong choice leads to an unphysical vortex flow the adaptive vc method introduces a momentum source term counteracting the error of the convection discretisation in an adaptive manner the magnitude of the source term is proportional to the estimated numerical diffusion defined with the difference between the central scheme introducing no diffusive error and the utilised scheme hahn and iaccarino 2009 proposed the adaptive vc method where is determined automatically based on an estimation of the numerical diffusion due to the convective discretisation this leads to the advantage compared to all other vc methods that there is no need for a user defined proportionality factor furthermore the target of the adaptive method differs from all others the adaptive method tries to compensate only for the numerical diffusion due to the convection discretisation whereas all other methods just reinforce vortices to compensate for any kind of dissipation accordingly it might be possible to generate stronger vortices with other methods compared to the adaptive method but it would be questionable whether the stronger vortex is closer to the physically correct result the derivation of the adaptive vc method is based on the estimation of the diffusive truncation error due to the discretisation of the convection term inside the momentum conservation equation with a scheme apart from the central one hahn and iaccarino used the upwind discretisation scheme this diffusive error d is estimated as the difference between two different discretisations of the convection term the central discretisation cds and the upwind discretisation uds the latter one should be modified in accordance with the used discretisation scheme within the solver settings 4 d u u cds u u uds which has the unit m s 2 this approach is consistent with the overall numerical approximation as d approaches zero if the corresponding numerical diffusion vanishes e g in case of infinitely fine mesh the adaptive definition for is the dot product of the difference d with the vector s divided by the squared magnitude of s 5 ε 1 s 2 d s for more information on the derivation see hahn and iaccarino 2009 in this study the adaptive method is used in conjunction with the linear upwind discretisation scheme termed luds following the difference in eq 4 is calculated as the difference between cds and luds especially if the adaptive method is used in conjunction with high order convection hoc schemes abrupt local unphysical changes of the sign of may occur in the vicinity of the vortex core see feder and abdel maksoud 2016a for that it is important to modify the adaptive method an appropriate solution is using the absolute value of 6 s ε s this still scales with the magnitude of the numerical diffusion and always points along s hence convects the vorticity back to the vortex centre and acts against numerical diffusion furthermore the vc source term will be restricted to the vicinity of the vortex therefore the local vortex identification criterion λ 2 will be used see jeong and hussain 1995 for λ 2 0 the adaptive source term will be set to zero the influence of the modified source term according to eq 6 and due to the restriction of the vc source term have been analysed by feder and abdel maksoud 2016b the following remarks concern the settings of the vc method within the simulations as the vc source term would introduce huge errors applied in the boundary layer flow the vicinity of the wing is excluded the vc source term is faded linearly after a wall distance of d 0 01 m within the layer 0 01 m d 0 02 m besides the source term is switched off near the inlet x c 2 and outlet x c 35 boundaries furthermore in order to smooth the sudden impact due to the activation of the model the source term is faded in linearly in time within 0 01 s after the simulation without vc has converged 3 5 boundary conditions for grid based methods the boundary conditions bcs are defined straightforward with the exception of those for the walls of the wind tunnel these walls may either be modelled by a no slip bc to represent the real wind tunnel flow with a closed test section or by a slip bc to save computational effort the modelling of the boundary layer flow on the wind tunnel walls is expensive because a fine mesh is required fig 6 a shows the standard hexpress mesh presented in fig 2 used with a slip bc on the walls and subfigure b shows the modified mesh that contains about 4 7 million cells more corresponding to approximately 80 to treat the wind tunnel walls both meshes are very similar in the vicinity of the wing the no slip bc wind tunnel wall is modelled via high re wall treatment in the results section the influence of the different bcs on the vortex evolution will be analysed see section 4 2 at the inlet the inflow velocity has the fixed value u the pressure was zero at the outlet and satisfies the zero gradient bc both on the wing and at the inlet on the wing surface the no slip boundary condition is enforced at the outlet the zero gradient bc are enforced for velocity k and ω fields wall functions for k and ω proposed in menter et al 2003b are applied on the wing for the high re number icem grids 3 6 grid free vortex method as shown below the application of grid based methods encounter difficulties with the accuracy of vortex tip simulation therefore we have also applied the grid free computational vortex method as an alternative to grid based one grid based methods are a very efficient and well developed tool to resolve the turbulent and laminar boundary layers close to the body on the contrary the particle based methods have many difficulties with formulation of boundary conditions and smooth representation of thin near wall flows therefore there are not much applications of vortex methods for real three dimensional configurations at high reynolds numbers however as will be shown further in this paper grid based techniques have a substantial artificial numerical viscosity in the wake resulting in a non realistic damping of vortex structures including tip vortices a natural way to escape these difficulties and to overcome disadvantages of grid based and particle based techniques is the application of domain decomposition close to bodies a grid based method is applied whereas far from the body a grid free one in this paper we use the domain decomposition procedure originally developed by cottet group see cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 sec 8 3 2 to improve the resolution of tip vortices by coupling the vortex method and the openfoam code the domain is decomposed into the upstream zone a and downstream zone b sub domains fig 7 in the zone a the openfoam is used whereas the flow in the zone b is handled using the vortex method the outlet conditions for the a domain solution are taken from the b domain by direct calculation of velocities induced by vortex elements located in b the vorticity is calculated at the interface and flows into the domain b where it is handled by a vortex method the schwartz alternating algorithm is applied to match the solutions in a and b at the interface x x 1 the abscissa x 1 is chosen from the condition that the grid based simulation is quite accurate at x 1 and can be used as an initial solution for the grid free method the vortex elements move and change their strength according to trajectory and vorticity transport equations the particle strength exchange pse method see for instance cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 is applied to take the diffusion effect into account the velocity induced by the wing and the tip vortices located in a a a b zone where a b is the overlapping zone positioned between x 1 and x 2 in the zone b is taken into account by the poincare identity see formula 4 3 19 in cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 or by the sources and dipoles continuously distributed on the faces of the a domain the source and dipole strengths are equal to the normal and tangential velocities on the faces the experience shows that for the problem under consideration an acceptable accuracy is attained if the sources and dipoles are distributed only on the face f i e in the section x x 1 in numerical simulations the continuous distributions are represented by a set of point sources and dipoles located at the centers of grid cell faces within the section x x 1 the distance x 2 x 1 is chosen being equal to the influence length of the source and dipole layers which is relatively short since the velocity induced by them decays as r 2 like all particle based methods the vortex element method runs in unsteady mode the time step is dictated by the accuracy of the calculation of velocities induced at vortex elements by the discrete sources and dipoles a preliminary study revealed that a proper accuracy is attained at the distance of δ m i n δ y δ z from the face f where δ y z are sizes of the cell face at a smaller distance the velocity rapidly increases due to a singular nature of point sources and dipoles larger distances are not desirable because of an overall resolution decrease from this consideration we get the time step estimation δ t δ u the results presented below are obtained using the vortex elements proposed by winckelmans and leonard 1993 which induce the velocity at any point x i according to formula 7 u i x i j 1 m γ j x i j 4 π σ j 3 ρ 5 2 ρ 1 5 2 where x i j x i x j and ρ x i j 2 σ j 2 σ j is a size of the vortex element which was taken as σ β δ where δ is the size of the grid at the outlet of the a subdomain the factor β 2 secures the overlapping between elements vortex elements are distributed nearly uniformly in space to get a proper element overlapping and stability of simulations see cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 to fulfill this requirement the vortices should uniformly be distributed already at the interface b 1 for that the openfoam results obtained on a non uniform grid are mapped onto a uniform grid at each schwartz iteration the openfoam mapped data are used to generate new vortex elements from the grid based solution using the following procedure when the discrete particles are used in the zone b the most natural condition to set the vortex element strength is 8 γ j ω o f x j v o l j where ω o f x j is the vorticity of the grid simulation at point x j and v o l j δ 3 is the volume of cell within which the vorticity is replaced by the j t h vortex element in what follows the index o f stands for quantities of the grid based solution when the resolution grows δ 0 the vortex elements with the strengths 8 induce the velocity u which is the same as the grid solution u o f at moderate δ for strong concentrated vortices there is a big discrepancy between u and u o f namely u o f u to match the velocities at the interface we perform additional adaption at each time instant using the condition of matching between vorticity induced by vortex elements and vorticity of the grid solution 9 u o f u from our experience it is better to use the condition 10 u o f x i p u x i p j 1 m γ j x i j 4 π σ j 3 ρ 5 2 ρ 1 5 2 where p stands for the projection of velocities u onto the grid the equations with unknowns γ j 10 can be solved as a system of 3 3 linear equations however it is a very consuming procedure that is why we project 10 on x axis since the vector γ has a dominant component along x axis and use the iteration process 11 α i m α i m 1 ε u o f x i p j 1 m γ j x i j 4 π σ j 3 ρ 5 2 ρ 1 5 2 i where ε is relaxation and α is amplification parameter once the iteration process is converged the strengths are updated 12 γ j α j m γ j this method which is very similar to the beale s iterative method see cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 pages 208 209 has a very good convergence at moderate overlapping β at large β the accuracy of approximation sufficiently degrades this is the reflection of the singular matrix problem when the radial based functions with a large overlapping are used for approximation the vortex method is used without turbulence model i e in dns direct numerical simulation mode 4 results 4 1 description of the data evaluation procedure numerical results are compared with measurements for the vortex core radius r 1 the peak tangential velocity v θ 1 and the axial velocity at the vortex center u 0 they are extracted from simulations without the correction of vortex wandering which was not documented in simulations although it occurs under real measurement conditions due to instabilities of the wind tunnel flow and small wing oscillations the vortex center at each x position is determined by the local minimum of λ 2 criterion in the x c o n s t plane the difference in results using any other criterion for instance q or λ c i is negligible the axial velocity u 0 is evaluated at the center at each radius r measured from the vortex center the tangential velocity is averaged in circumferential direction the vortex core is defined as the radius r 1 at which the averaged tangential velocity reaches its maximum value the vortex core parameters are analysed at the x positions of the measurements x c 5 10 30 and additionally at x c 1 5 2 3 4 upstream of x c 1 5 the concentrated tip vortex is hard to identify since the roll up process is not completed if the core radius exceeds 0 4 c at large distances from the wing the vortex core parameters are not evaluated because the vortex becomes too smooth and dissipates to a weak level the evaluation of the unsteady simulations starts after 0 6 s in this time the flow passes the distance of interest x c 30 more than three times what is enough to exclude the start up transitional phase the unsteady simulations results are averaged in time within the period of 0 1 s which is large enough to guarantee the convergence of statistical data for a proper validation it is important to compare our results not only with measurements but also with other numerical simulations unfortunately we found only one available simulation data for the devenport et al test case performed by wells et al 2010 who applied various turbulence models to assess their performance in predicting a tip vortex flow the one equation model of spalart allmaras with and without curvature correction and the reynolds stress transport model rsm lrr proposed by launder et al 1975 a structured mesh with 11 9 m cells and wall functions for the resolution of the boundary layer flow on the wing were utilised unfortunately there is no information available on the grid resolution in the vicinity of the vortex core wells determined the tip vortex parameters in a slightly different way than in this study the vortex center is determined by the maximum helicity the tangential velocity profile used to determine r 1 and v θ 1 is evaluated only along one line parallel to the z axis through the vortex core without averaging in circumferential direction the main conclusion of his work is the superiority of the rsm model in comparison with others its application leads to results which match very well the experimental ones at small x c unfortunately no information is presented downstream of x c 10 because of strong dissipation of the tip vortex in the far field 4 2 influence of the boundary condition of the wind tunnel walls this section deals with the influence of different boundary conditions bcs applied to the wind tunnel walls slip or no slip ones devenport et al 1996 observed a slight streamwise pressure gradient d c p d x 0 3 m 1 along the wind tunnel due to the evolution of the boundary layer this obvious phenomenon leads to an acceleration of the flow the question is whether the boundary layer evolution on the tunnel walls needs to be considered for a proper prediction of the tip vortex evolution therefore two simulations will be carried out on the no slip mesh see fig 6b using the sa ddes turbulence model one with a slip and one with a no slip bc realised on the tunnel walls following the high re wall treatment of the tunnel walls the mean max y value is about 95 150 and justifies the use of wall functions for the attached boundary layer flow the numerical settings are similar to the ones used for the hybrid rans les turbulence models on the hexpress slip mesh the influence of the different boundary conditions on the vortex strength until x c 30 is negligible comparing with the no slip condition the core radius increases by about 0 2 and the peak tangential velocity decreases by about 0 8 for the slip condition both values show no clear tendency behind the wing besides the axial velocity at the vortex centre decreases by about 1 4 using the slip condition the difference between the slip and no slip result increases monotonously in the streamwise direction both points are reasonable because the boundary layer evolution accelerates the free flow thus the neglected boundary layer evolution leads to a slight deceleration of the axial vortex flow and can be considered in simulations however the slip bc is proven to be sufficiently accurate for the objective of the current paper comparison of different approaches to predict a tip vortex flow hence it will be used in the following simulations 4 3 comparison of different turbulence models on icem and hexpress meshes 4 3 1 icem mesh fig 8 illustrates the influence of the mesh resolution and the curvature correction for the icem mesh first of all it is to note a strong degradation of the concentrated tip vortex in the far wake field the maximum tangential velocity and consequently the vortex strength losses about two thirds of its initial value whereas the vortex core is spread up with the factor of four and more large discrepancy between measurement and simulations underlines the importance of the problem considered in the present paper simulations are not capable of predicting the tip vortex flows at distances from the wing x c 5 which are relatively moderate and quite typical for marine applications for instance helicoidal tip vortices of propellers interact with rudders in the far vortex wake therefore such a discrepancy makes impossible numerical analysis of some important practical problems for instance of the tip vortex cavitation influence on the rudder erosion in this paper we are going to clear which models and grids are able to improve the simulation accuracy grid independence study showed that convergence is attained on the grid with 7 2 million cells with and without curvature correction models for this resolution the influence of the curvature corrections is positive but insufficient for a radical improvement of the modelling accuracy as seen the confining effect of both curvature correction models on the vortex radius is big at coarse resolution 2 7 m and becomes negligible at finer resolutions it is hard to find any advantage of one model with respect to the other their effects are comparable fig 9 shows the comparison for the core parameters obtained using different turbulence models among these turbulence models lrr yields the best result the reason is that the rsm models take the anisotropy of the flow into account and the consideration of the rotation effects is an inherent part of the modelling unfortunately the application of the rsm has a strong limitation because of numerical instabilities which were documented in our case at meshes finer than 7 2 million cells the most promising results were obtained using no turbulence model termed w o as seen in fig 9 the lowest rate of vortex decay occurs without turbulence modelling followed first by lrr and then by sa ddes fig 8 shows that the turbulence models based on one and two equation eddy viscosity models with curvature correction lead to inferior results the strong decay of the vortex strength and the vortex core spreading downstream of x c 20 illustrated in fig 9 is due to coarsening of the grid at x c 20 here it should be noted that as stated by devenport et al 1996 the flow on the wing and the tip vortex depend on the tripping of the boundary layer on wing at x c 10 for different locations of tripping the radius r 1 is changed between 0 033 and 0 037 whereas without tripping it was 0 038 the tangential velocity is varied between 0 263 and 0 286 being equal to 0 291 without tripping these differences are around ten percent and cannot be used as an explanation of big discrepancy between numerical results with and without turbulence modeling the parameter most affected by the turbulence tripping is the axial velocity since its distribution is strongly dependent of the wing boundary layer which is in turn depends on the flow regime on the wing with tripping the axial velocity deficit u 0 u u is varied between 0 152 and 0 182 whereas it is two times less without tripping 0 086 the latter value is in a good agreement with the solution obtained on the finest mesh without turbulence modelling fig 9 the circulation γ was found using the classical definition γ r v θ d c r where c r is the circle with the radius r c numerical integration along the circle is performed using l 360 points the velocity v θ at the points is calculated using a linear interpolation between neighbouring grid cell centres increase of l doesn t lead to the increase of accuracy because the distance between the integration points is smaller than grid cell size the circulation of the solution without turbulence modelling inside of the tip vortex is higher than this of the solutions based on turbulence models what is in accordance with relations stated above for the tangential velocity outside of the vortex core at r c 0 05 the circulation γ obtained without a turbulence modelling approach is proved to be smaller than these of the turbulent calculations it can be explained as follows as seen in fig 10 the roll up process is not completed up to x c 5 and the circulation continues to grow in the range up to r c 0 5 due to vortex sheet shed from the trailing edge contrary to the turbulent solution the solution without turbulence modelling is very unsteady with creation of vorticity of opposite signs in the vortex sheet the contribution of the sheet vorticity with rotations opposite to this of the tip vortex reduces the growth of the circulation and makes its dependency on r non monotonic as result γ of the w o model solution becomes smaller outside the vortex core increase of resolution in turbulent simulations from 7 2 m to 42 m of cells which reduces the discretisation errors and artificial viscosity show no improvement in the numerical results therefore the superiority of the solution without turbulence modelling leads to the conclusion that this model is physically more relevant than turbulent models and the flow inside the tip vortex is rather laminar than turbulent although the reynolds number is high enough to expect the turbulent character of the flow both on the wing and in the wake this simulation supports the conclusion of devenport et al 1996 that flow in the core is laminar and that velocity fluctuations experienced here are inactive motions produced as the core is buffeted by turbulence from the surrounding wake the shapes of the profiles do change however and at a rate that is not inconsistent with laminar diffusion devenport et al 1996 4 3 2 hexpress mesh fig 11 shows the influence of different turbulence models on the evolution of the tip vortex core parameters both spalart allmaras and k ω sst with curvature correction cc and hybrid models with improved delayed des iddes as well as delayed des ddes models besides the approach without turbulence modelling termed w o is considered too a peculiar point about these results is that sa cc leads to an overprediction of the axial velocity deficit considering both other vortex core parameters shows that the agreement with the experimental results is worst for sa cc model a possible reason is the overestimation of the boundary layer thickness in the spalart allmaras model resulting in overestimation of the vortex radius and axial velocity deficit the use of k ω sst leads to a stronger vortex compared to the result gained with spalart allmaras in case of sst cc and sst iddes but not in case of sst ddes sa ddes is more accurate the strongest vortex and therewith the highest accuracy concerning the core size and the peak tangential velocity is obtained without turbulence modelling compared to sa ddes the core is smaller and the peak tangential velocity is equal comparing the result obtained without turbulence modelling with the experimental one at x c 30 the core radius is about 2 3 times larger the peak tangential velocity is about 29 smaller and the axial velocity is about 8 6 higher the axial velocity deficit is about 45 smaller for the numerical prediction although the deviation of the nondimensional axial velocity deficit between the numerical predictions and the experimental value is quite high around 50 and more the deviation of the predicted axial velocity itself is much lower deviation around 10 considering the mesh refinements of the icem mesh or that of the hexpress mesh in feder and abdel maksoud 2016b the accuracy of the core radius and peak tangential velocity prediction can be significantly increased refining the mesh in the vicinity of the tip vortex for the des models and the approach without turbulence modelling wells 2009 evaluates the simulation results only until x c 10 as he remarks excessive dissipation of the tip vortex further downstream this can be seen in fig 11 especially the decrease of the peak tangential velocity is very high compared to the results obtained within this study nevertheless the accuracy of all three vortex core parameters at x c 5 is very good and the result is clearly superior in comparison to the results obtained here a possible explanation for the decrease between x c 5 and x c 10 is a change in the mesh coarsening unfortunately wells 2009 provides no detailed information concerning the mesh density in the vicinity of the vortex core which would allow to draw more detailed explanations of the difference between both simulations 4 4 potential of adaptive mesh refinement fig 12 shows the icem mesh after the adaptive refinement in the vicinity of the vortex core resulting in the mesh with 30 million of cells the initial mesh before refinement contains 7 2 m of cells the mesh topology at the boundary of vortex is skewed which could cause numerical errors negatively affecting the solution accuracy in the area surrounding the vortex core unfortunately the hope to improve the accuracy of the simulation using amr in the vortex core was not justified as seen in fig 13 the application of the amr has a negligible positive effect on the calculation results 4 5 comparison of results for two meshes 7 2 m icem and 6 0 m hexpress the tangential velocity close to the wing is proportional to the vortex circulation and therefore to the lift the lift coefficient of the wing using the vles w o without turbulence modelling approach on the fine icem mesh 42 million grid points is around 0 46 this value is equal to this obtained from the panel code autowing see kornev 2016 for the cases run on the icem meshes based on two equation turbulence models and the des version the lift coefficient is between approximately 0 41 and 0 42 larger lift for the finer meshes the turbulent simulations on the hexpress grid provide a lift coefficient between approximately 0 45 turbulence models based on sa and vles and 0 47 based on sst which is roughly ten percent higher compared to the icem meshes and similar to c l from the panel method we suppose that at small angle of attack of 5 the lift coefficient should be independent on the viscous effects therefore the results for inviscid flow and flow with and without turbulence modelling should be close to each other a possible reason for the low lift coefficient on the icem grid is the inaccuracy in the turbulent boundary layer modelling using wall functions applied in the buffer zone region between 5 y 30 as a result the boundary layer thickness is overestimated what results in the overestimation of the displacement effects and reduction of the lift coefficient while on the icem grid both models sa cc and k ω sst cc provide almost the same results at moderate and fine resolutions there is a big difference between two models on the hexpress grid see fig 11 this can be explained by different treatment of the boundary layer on the wing on icem grid the inner part of the layer is modelled by wall function making the difference between models negligible when the boundary layer is well resolved the advantage of the k ω sst approach for boundary layer modelling comes into play the thickness of the boundary layer which has a strong impact on the tip vortex core radius is predicted more accurately by the k ω sst model the core radius from sa model is obviously overestimated with respect to both measurement and k ω sst results what leads to the underestimation of the tangential velocity as result the accuracy of the k ω sst cc model outperforms this of the sa cc model with the other words the advantages of the k ω sst cc model are due to advantages of the pure k ω sst model over the pure sa model fig 14 shows the influence of different meshes for two turbulence models k ω sst with curvature correction and spalart allmaras delayed des for the hexpress mesh the length of the mesh cells l in the vicinity of the tip vortex core in the x plane is about l c 0 0088 for the icem mesh with 7 2 m cells the cell size changes in the vicinity of the vortex in the x plane because of the mesh structure the average cell size is approximately l c 0 01074 i e about 22 larger than for the hexpress mesh based on the results gained with the des approach it is clear that the result on the hexpress mesh is superior compared to the one on the icem mesh the core size is smaller the peak tangential velocity is higher and the axial velocity deficit is also smaller all this results in a smaller discrepancy with experimental data for each quantity one reason for the superiority of the hexpress mesh might be the increased mesh density in the vicinity of the vortex core another possible reason is the different wall treatment icem mesh has large y values and requires utilisation of wall functions whereas fine resolution of the turbulence boundary layer is performed on hexpress mesh 4 6 potential of vorticity confinement feder and abdel maksoud showed in feder and abdel maksoud 2016a for the devenport test case that the potential of vc depends on the turbulence modelling for the standard spalart allmaras model the increase of the vortex strength was much less compared to the increase using spalart allmaras delayed des a possible reason for the strong dissipation of the tip vortex is the huge overprediction of turbulence intensity created by the spalart allmaras model this also leads to a small vc source term which is proportional to the vorticity hence the numerical diffusion due to the overprediction of the turbulent viscosity cannot be balanced by vc in this section the potential of the adaptive vc method in conjunction with sa sst iddes and sa sst ddes and an approach without turbulence modelling termed w o is compared the vortex core parameters are shown in fig 15 firstly the influence of vc on the vortex is negligible in case of sa sst iddes compared to the effect in case of sa sst ddes a possible explanation is that the vortex is considerably weaker in case of sa sst iddes without vc about twice the core radius and about two third to three quarter the peak tangential velocity of the result of sa sst ddes hence as the vc source magnitude is proportional to the vorticity the source term is smaller and therewith the effect of vc considering the approaches based on ddes and without turbulence modelling the application of vc leads to a significant reduction of the vortex core radius and a significant increase of the peak tangential velocity besides the axial velocity at the vortex centre is increased also in the following the effect of the vc method will be described in detail using the relative change of the core parameters r 1 and v θ 1 at the measurement points x c 5 10 30 for both iddes turbulence models the effect is negligible less than 2 for the approaches sa ddes sst ddes and without turbulence modelling the core radius is reduced in average by about 9 20 and 32 respectively the peak tangential velocity for these approaches is increased in average by about 10 19 and 17 the results of sa ddes and sst ddes with vc are comparable considering the core size one turbulence model is superior considering the peak tangential velocity the other one is superior however the sst ddes model shows higher accuracy in terms of the axial velocity which leads to its overall superiority the strongest vortex in terms of small core size and high rotational velocity is obtained without turbulence modelling vles approach and vc which leads also to the smallest error compared to the experimental results feder and abdel maksoud 2016b analyse the potential of the adaptive vc method in conjunction with different resolutions of the mesh in the vicinity of the tip vortex therefore the sa ddes turbulence model with the same settings for the same test case is used the results show that the relative change of the core radius and the peak tangential velocity due to the application of the adaptive vc method is nearly equal if the cells in the wake are refined or coarsened by the factor two 4 7 grid free lagrangian simulations using computational vortex method cvm the previous results gained with grid based methods showed that the vortex decay is large in each case compared to the experimental result the reason for that is the inherent numerical diffusion due to insufficient mesh resolution and insufficiently accurate turbulence modelling therefore the potential of grid free vortex methods will be evaluated in this section the algorithm presented in section 3 6 was implemented into openfoam toolkit results obtained using lagrangian simulation are presented in figs 16 and 17 the grid used was uniform with the size δ x y z δ velocity field necessary for inlet conditions at the interface between openfoam and cvm domain was mapped onto the uniform grid the ordinary differential equations describing the particle motion are integrated using the predictor corrector or euler corrected method with the trapezoidal rule as mentioned above the time step δ t is chosen so that the particles paths close to the interface within δ t is around δ i e δ t m i n δ u u x where u x is the perturbation velocity induced by vortex and wing in simulations presented below it was around δ t 1 04 10 4 s to reduce the computational time the number of vortex element is limited when the vortices are identified at the interface f from the openfoam solution only vortices with the vorticity magnitude larger than 10 percent of the maximum vorticity enter into the domain b the discrete vortices at the interface f at x c 4 are determined on the uniform grid with the size δ using the matching algorithm described above the grid free simulation was matched with the openfoam grid simulation using k ω sst model with 7 2 m cells at δ c 2 e 2 the computational domain of the vortex method is occupied by 86 500 vortex elements with 61 elements in the tip vortex cross section at x c 4 see fig 16 the vortex core parameters presented in fig 17 were obtained by averaging within 0 01 s the maximum tangential velocity related to that at the interface between the grid based and grid free computational domains is presented a similar ratio is presented for the vortex core radius it should be noted that despite a discrete representation of vorticity by vortex elements the distribution of the velocity and radius remain smooth and regular up to the end of the computational domain excepting a very short initial range close to the interface the reason is the transition of the solution from the grid based to the grid free ones which is still not accurately simulated due to discrete representation of the continuous source and dipole layers and an inaccuracy in matching between two computational domains as seen from fig 17 the radius of the tip vortex is slightly grows by fourteen percent along the whole computational domain at 4 x c 34 the maximum tangential velocity decreases only by seven percent at the end of the domain this is the best numerical solution obtained so far it shows a strong potential of the grid free method to radically improve the quality of numerical simulation of the tip vortex flow however this method has two substantial restrictions first since the method has a sufficiently reduced numerical viscosity the stability of the pure lagrangian simulation can be critical for strong concentrated vortices at large reynolds numbers second improvement of the tip vortex resolution by increase of particle number is limited due to high computational costs when the particle number increasing therefore study of the cvm method properties as well as the development of efficient algorithms will be continued in the future works of the authors 5 conclusions a proper prediction of the tip vortex evolution is a big challenge for computational fluid mechanics despite of many efforts to solve this classical problem having a big practical importance in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics in numerical simulations the tip vortex rapidly degrades loosing its strength and spreads up already at distances of a few dozens of the wing chord as a result numerical analysis of important practical problems for instance of the tip vortex cavitation influence on the rudder erosion with an acceptable accuracy becomes impossible in this paper we tried to find an efficient way to improve the simulation accuracy using different numerical methods grids and turbulence models it was shown that the application of curvature correction cc to standard two equation turbulence models of spalart allmaras and k ω sst improved results at a rate which depends on the grid for the coarse grid the improvement is substantial for fine grids with large y and an approximate treatment of the boundary layers using wall functions the influence of the curvature correction is negligible on the contrary the grids with well resolved boundary layer and small y show a strong sensitivity to curvature corrections the k ω sst model with curvature correction according to smirnov and menter 2009 has a clear advantage over the corrected spalart allmaras model in conjunction with adaptive mesh refinement amr these turbulence models showed insignificant improvement for fine grid resolution the performance of the detached eddy simulation models like ddes and iddes is proved to be much better than this of the one and two equation turbulence models the highest accuracy among des models is provided by the delayed des approach which prevents the vortex from large diffusion the highest accuracy among all u rans turbulence models is attained with the lrr reynolds stress transport models rsm which takes the anisotropy of the turbulent wake into account and the rotation effects are an inherent part of modelling in this technique the most promising results among grid based methods were obtained using the approach without turbulence modelling which can be classified as an underresolved very large eddy simulation without a subgrid model the superiority of this solution leads to the conclusion that the used turbulence models do not reproduce the flow relaminarization in the vicinity of the tip vortex core which is the reason for the very slow tip vortex decay this simulation supports the conclusion of devenport et al 1996 that the flow in the core is laminar and that velocity fluctuations experienced here are inactive motions produced as the core is buffeted by turbulence from the surrounding wake this fact explains also the improvement of numerical solution when des is applied indeed in des the turbulent viscosity within the tip vortex is reduced by switching the turbulent solution to les one in this way the total viscosity approaches to the laminar one and the accuracy of the numerical solution is improved the potential of the adaptive vorticity confinement method depends on the underlying turbulence model its application reinforced the vortex flow but also can lead to an acceleration of the axial flow component a further extensive investigation is needed to determine the drive mechanism for this acceleration to further reduce the artificial vortex diffusion a pure lagrangian grid free vortex method is applied to simulate the tip vortex dynamics in the far wake grid free simulation is coupled with the grid based one in the near wake where the vortex diffusion can be considered as small the flow on the wing and in the near wake is treated using grid based method whereas the remaining flow part is calculated using the grid free approach grid free vortex method provides the most promising results showing the lowest rate of the vortex strength decay and vortex core spreading however this method has two substantial restrictions firstly since the method has a sufficiently reduced numerical viscosity the stability of the pure lagrangian simulation can be critical for strong concentrated vortices at large reynolds numbers second improvement of the tip vortex resolution by increase of particle number is limited due to high computational costs when the particle number increasing further development of the grid free vortex and grid based vortex confinement methods as well as their coupling seem to be a very promising way for a radical improvement of the accuracy of tip vortex dynamics

23753,this paper compares the performance of different grid based and grid free modelling approaches to predict the tip vortex evolution in both near and far wing wake fields the grid based methods cover different turbulence modelling approaches adaptive mesh refinement and the adaptive vorticity confinement vc method using the openfoam code computational vortex method cvm coupled with the openfoam simulation of the near field is utilised to properly predict the tip vortex behaviour in the far field all simulation results are compared to results of the wind tunnel experiments conducted by devenport et al 1996 the comparison is based on the analysis of the vortex core parameters the core size the peak tangential velocity and the axial velocity deficit additionally the results are compared with another numerical study by wells 2009 2010 it turns out that turbulence modelling plays an important role since simple one and two equation models overpredict the turbulence intensity in the vortex core resulting in its fast decay the potential of the adaptive vc method depends on the underlying turbulence model grid free vortex method shows a good potential to improve the simulation accuracy keywords tip vortex grid free vortex method turbulence modelling adaptive mesh refinement adaptive vorticity confinement 1 introduction wing tip vortices decay slowly and extend far downstream in the wake strong tip vortices with a large lifetime can be observed in many engineering applications with rotating lifting surfaces in marine engineering the most important application is the marine propeller hydrodynamics in case of submerged ship propellers tip vortex cavitation may create noise and lead to erosion of the rudder the noise prediction is of big importance because it disturbs animals like whales and reduces comfort of people on board ship the propeller slipstream including the tip vortices prescribes the flow at the rudder and therewith influences the rudder forces lifting foils are used in shipbuilding to damp ship roll motions and for the creation of the dynamic lift on hydrofoil ships in these cases the trailing tip vortices may influence the inflow of the propeller or foils moving downstream in the wake a further important area where tip vortices play a dominant role is the wake of aircraft the evolution of the tip vortices of landing and starting aircraft has been extensively studied with respect to the hazard of wake encounter by other craft flying close to the big one also for wing in ground wig effect vehicles the wake and tip vortex evolution has a strong influence on the flight stability see e g kornev and matveev 2003 rozhdestvensky 2006 the prediction of tip vortices with computational fluid dynamics cfd is a challenge as inherent artificial dissipation effects lead to an unphysically strong decay of the vortices the artificial dissipation or numerical diffusion results from numerical errors due to the discretisation and turbulence modelling feder and abdel maksoud 2016b provide further information on this topic in conjunction with the numerical prediction of tip vortices an accurate numerical prediction of the tip vortex evolution is limited by a huge amount of necessary computational resources and imperfection of available mathematical models several numerical and experimental studies deal with the evolution of tip vortices and the difficulties concerning their prediction gerz holzäpfel and misaka worked extensively on the numerical prediction of tip vortices within the wake of aircraft see e g gerz et al 2002 holzäpfel et al 2003 misaka et al 2013 and stephan et al 2014 or chow et al 1994 their approach is usually based on the application of large eddy simulations les targeting to predict the vortex decay of aircraft including the influence of the ground effect on the tip vortices and their evolution in the atmospheric boundary layer several studies deal with the analysis of tip vortex evolution in the near field so up to a few chord lengths downstream an interesting study is published by samal et al 2013 who investigated the flow structure of a wing tip vortex behind a sweptback and tapered naca 0015 wing at r e 181000 their simulation results showed a good agreement with experimental results further studies by nash at et al 2013 have been conducted to analyse the wake in the near field of a naca 0012 wing this paper focuses on grid based and grid free methods to capture the details of vortices especially further downstream after the vortex has rolled up and started to decay kornev and abbas 2016 studied cfd performance to predict the near vortex field in the wake of an oscillating wing at distances of one and half chords from the trailing edge they showed a good agreement with experimental results of birch and lee 2005 experimental investigations of wing tip vortices in wind tunnels confirm that tip vortices extend for long distances in the wake devenport et al 1996 carried out an extensive study of a tip vortex trailing from a naca 0012 wing until 30 chord lengths downstream of the wing they present experimental data of turbulence properties as well as the tangential and axial velocities in the vicinity of the vortex core the quality of the experimental data is superior to many other investigations because they were corrected for the wandering of the tip vortex core caused by instability of wind tunnel flow and possible wing vibration wells published a numerical study for the devenport test case and analysed the performance of different turbulence models see wells 2009 wells et al 2010 in the near field the accuracy of the simulation results using a reynolds stress turbulence model is very good further downstream wells observes excessive diffusion of the tip vortex which is not supported by experimental results within this study different grid based and grid free simulation approaches are validated for prediction of the tip vortex evolution using the devenport test case according to the measurements of devenport et al 1996 the flow in the vicinity of the vortex core is laminar utilisation of standard reynolds averaged navier stokes rans turbulence models based on boussinesq approach leads to an overprediction of the turbulence viscosity within the vortex core which in turn results in its increased decay rate as a remedy of this disadvantage several improved turbulence models validated in this paper were proposed by different authors curvature corrections for rans models hybrid rans les methods and reynolds stress transport models the artificial numerical viscosity can be reduced by adaptive mesh refinement amr and the adaptive vorticity confinement vc methods which are also in the focus of this paper the first approach refines the mesh in the vicinity of the vortex core and the second approach introduces a momentum source term which should counteract the numerical diffusion the vc method was developed by steinhoff and colleagues in 1992 steinhoff et al 1992 steinhoff and underhill 1994 and steinhoff et al 2005 and further developed by several authors it overcomes the significant deficiency of the previous vc formulations as it lacks the necessity of a user defined forcing coefficient recent applications of the vc method showed its potential for ship propeller hydrodynamics see e g zhang et al 2014 another work to be mentioned here is presented by o regan et al see o regan et al 2016 who demonstrated that the potential of vc is larger in conjunction with les turbulence modelling than with any urans approach this behaviour was observed also by feder and abdel maksoud in feder and abdel maksoud 2016a for the adaptive vc method 2 test case this study targets to validate cfd models using the benchmark test case thoroughly studied in wind tunnel measurements presented in devenport et al 1996 the basic setup of the experiment is shown in fig 1 during the experiment the evolution of a tip vortex generated by a rectangular wing with the naca 0012 profile was studied the wing with a blunt tip has the following dimensions a span of 0 879 m and a chord length of c 0 203 m the wind tunnel has a quadratic test section of 1 83 m width and 7 33 m length devenport et al provide the most extensive data for the reynolds number r e 530000 based on the chord length and for 5 angle of attack there the vortex is tracked downstream until 30 chord lengths behind the leading edge of the wing experimental data are provided for axial and tangential velocity profiles through the vortex core and for turbulence properties e g the turbulent kinetic energy the target of the simulation approaches used in this paper is to predict the evolution of tip vortices until large distances downstream for this purpose the test case of devenport et al is more informative than other experiments at which the tip vortices are tracked only in the near wake of wings besides another advantage of this wind tunnel data is the proper correction for the vortex wandering motion this slow side to side movement is usually observed for wind tunnel generated tip vortices without a proper correction of this effect the experimental data would suggest an increased vortex decay the way how the experimental data is corrected is presented in details in devenport et al 1996 feder and abdel maksoud 2016b did not observe wandering within a similar previous numerical study this observation was based on the hexpress mesh with 6 0 m cells and the sa ddes turbulence model the solver settings were equal to the ones used for the transient simulations within this study as no wandering was observed within the simulations the corresponding correction is not necessary the postprocessing of the simulation results will be presented in section 4 1 3 numerical setup the simulations are conducted with openfoam see weller et al 1998 on grids with hexahedral cells generated with hexpress and structured grids generated with ansys icem cfd the coordinate system is set according to devenport et al 1996 and displayed in fig 2 a the origin is placed at the leading edge on the wing tip the x axis points downstream and the y axis points along the wing the computational domain is shown in fig 2a the inlet boundary is located at x c 7 4 whereas the outlet at x c 46 7 the boundaries with y and z normals denote the walls of the wind tunnel s test section the size of the domain s cross section corresponds to the measuring section of the wind tunnel and the location of the wing in the cross section is identical to the experimental one 3 1 grids 3 1 1 hexpress low re number grid the low reynolds number mesh was generated with hexpress version 5 1 the turbulent boundary layer is well resolved up to the viscous sublayer fig 2a shows the medium mesh at certain boundaries an advantage of the hexpress mesh is the possibility to attain a homogeneous cell size with a desired refinement level in the vicinity of the vortex core the cell size around the tip vortex in the measurement section x c 5 30 is chosen to obtain about eight cells inside the mean measured core diameter the total cell number is approximately 6 0 m since the first cell height is small 2 10 5 m which yields y 1 no wall functions are applied within the simulation a few cell about 20 layers are used within the boundary layer this mesh was also used within the previous studies by feder and abdel maksoud on the devenport test case there the influence of static mesh refinement was investigated 3 1 2 icem high re number grid three meshes of different resolutions are generated in ansys icem cfd the first mesh with 2 7 million of cells is initially coarse in the whole computational domain while gets a little finer in the regions close to the wing see fig 3 by the use of the special routine of openfoam two boxes are introduced for static refinement within the vortex core the first box extends from the leading edge to x c 10 distance while the second one extends further to x c 20 in all the three directions each cell in the first box is refined with the factor of two while this factor in the second box is four this results in intermediate fine 7 2 million mesh grid further refining the 7 2 million mesh in both boxes by doubling the cell number in all three directions results in the finest mesh of 42 2 million cells see fig 4 the non dimensional position of the first node y is varied between 5 and 40 on the wing for all grids since the refinement is done only in the zone around the tip vortex thus the inner part of the boundary is not resolved and these grids can be ascribed to the so called high re number grids in this the application of wall functions is necessary in what follows for the sake of brevity the grids are referred to as hexpress and icem grids 3 2 improvement of grid resolution using adaptive mesh refinement adaptive mesh refinement amr allows one to refine the grid locally within the vortex core using e g the q criterion for instance such a technology developed by jasak and tukovic 2010 is based on the computed numerical error gradients in the flow each mesh cell was split into two and four subcells in all three directions referring them further as to q1 and q2 refinement respectively this method was applied on the icem meshes described above and adapted at each time step buffering of the mesh was also introduced which takes into account the refinement layers of the neighbours of the cells which are set for refinement the mesh gets refined only in the region of the tip vortex as shown see fig 5 amr was applied only to simulations with curvature corrected turbulence models 3 3 solver settings and turbulence models several simulations summarised in table 1 were carried out the following paragraphs provide further detailed information on the used numerical methods and models in case of the unsteady simulations the flow passed the measurement domain δ x 30 c thirty times the chordlength at least twice and for most cases 3 5 times for each case the simulation was stopped when the mean vortex flow converged rans and urans models several different turbulence models are compared with the same solver settings the following list gives an overview one equation turbulence model spalart allmaras presented by spalart and allmaras 1994 termed sa one equation turbulence model spalart allmaras with curvature correction presented by shur et al 2000 termed sa cc two equation turbulence model k ω sst presented by menter et al 2003a termed sst two equation turbulence model k ω sst with curvature correction presented by smirnov and menter 2009 termed sst cc launder reece rodi reynolds stress turbulence model presented by launder et al termed lrr for the above rans simulations following settings were taken the spatial discretisation of the convective term is performed using the filtered linear scheme implemented in openfoam this scheme calculates the face values using blending of linear interpolation with a particular amount of upwind depending on the ratio of the background in cell gradient and face gradient the amount of upwind is limited to 30 the laplacian term was discretised using the linear scheme with explicit non orthogonal correction pressure gradient was reconstructed using linear scheme based on the green gauss theorem the equations for k and ω were discretised in the same manner except the convective term for which a tvd scheme with sweby flux limiter was applied without turbulence modelling as mentioned above one of a serious disadvantages of turbulence models which leads to a fast vortex decay is the overprediction of the turbulence intensity in the vicinity of the tip vortex core to analyse this issues some simulations are carried out without turbulence modelling i e the unsteady navier stokes equations are solved this can be classified as an underresolved very large eddy simulation vles without a sub grid model termed here w o in case of the 42 m icem mesh the simulation was carried out in an unsteady mode using the piso algorithm running four times for pressure correction loop to reach convergence time derivatives discretisation has been done using the backward difference scheme and the maximum courant number was approximately ten considering the hexpress mesh the time derivatives were discretised like for the hybrid rans les models see tab 1 for an overview of settings hybrid rans les models several hybrid turbulence models termed detached eddy simulation des are used to account for the typical deficiency of standard rans models which overpredict the turbulence viscosity in the vortex core this deficiency can be overcome if les is applied in the vicinity of the tip vortex downstream of the wing the des models are based on the one equation spalart allmaras sa see spalart and allmaras 1994 and the two equation k ω sst sst see menter and esch 2001 turbulence models spalart allmaras delayed des presented by spalart et al 2006 termed sa ddes spalart allmaras improved delayed des presented by shur et al 2008 termed sa iddes k ω sst delayed des presented by gritskevich et al 2012 termed sst ddes k ω sst improved delayed des presented by gritskevich et al 2012 termed sst iddes all simulations with hybrid turbulence models are conducted with the pimplefoam solver a large time step transient solver using the piso and the simple algorithms see e g ferziger and perić 2002 the relaxation factor is set to 0 3 for all variables during each time step the simple algorithm is run 20 times with one pressure correction loop each to reach convergence for the high maximum courant number of approximately 160 the convection term of the momentum equation is discretised with a linear upwind discretisation scheme luds the time is discretised using the first order implicit euler scheme 3 4 adaptive vorticity confinement the approach vorticity confinement vc describes methods which reinforce vortices and therewith act against the dissipation due to numerical errors within all vc methods an artificial source term s is introduced into the momentum conservation equations e g for incompressible flow 1 u t u u 1 ρ p ν δ u s with the velocity u the density ρ the pressure p and the kinematic viscosity ν for different vc methods s can be generalised to 2 s ε s the proportionality factor unit m s controls the strength of the source term the vector s unit 1 s is defined by 3 s ω ω ω where ω is the vorticity thus s points along vorticity magnitude contour lines different formulations of the vector s are not considered in this study because firstly the adaptive vc method which will be evaluated in this paper uses the presented formulation and secondly the disadvantages listed subsequently refer to ε and cannot be compensated by another choice of s the influence of the vc source term was described smartly by hahn and iaccarino 2009 considering an axisymmetric vortex tube where the vector ω points outward from the vortex centre the source term convects vorticity back toward the vortex centre as it diffuses outward the original vc technique was proposed by steinhoff and colleagues in 1992 steinhoff et al 1992 steinhoff and underhill 1994 and steinhoff et al 2005 the factor was set to a user defined value which is constant over the domain several authors improved this method including the local grid size and vortical fields like the helicity in the calculation of the source term this improves the results of vc but still there is no universal approach to determine the appropriate value of the user defined factor the trial and error approach to find the appropriate value is time consuming and not reliable a wrong choice leads to an unphysical vortex flow the adaptive vc method introduces a momentum source term counteracting the error of the convection discretisation in an adaptive manner the magnitude of the source term is proportional to the estimated numerical diffusion defined with the difference between the central scheme introducing no diffusive error and the utilised scheme hahn and iaccarino 2009 proposed the adaptive vc method where is determined automatically based on an estimation of the numerical diffusion due to the convective discretisation this leads to the advantage compared to all other vc methods that there is no need for a user defined proportionality factor furthermore the target of the adaptive method differs from all others the adaptive method tries to compensate only for the numerical diffusion due to the convection discretisation whereas all other methods just reinforce vortices to compensate for any kind of dissipation accordingly it might be possible to generate stronger vortices with other methods compared to the adaptive method but it would be questionable whether the stronger vortex is closer to the physically correct result the derivation of the adaptive vc method is based on the estimation of the diffusive truncation error due to the discretisation of the convection term inside the momentum conservation equation with a scheme apart from the central one hahn and iaccarino used the upwind discretisation scheme this diffusive error d is estimated as the difference between two different discretisations of the convection term the central discretisation cds and the upwind discretisation uds the latter one should be modified in accordance with the used discretisation scheme within the solver settings 4 d u u cds u u uds which has the unit m s 2 this approach is consistent with the overall numerical approximation as d approaches zero if the corresponding numerical diffusion vanishes e g in case of infinitely fine mesh the adaptive definition for is the dot product of the difference d with the vector s divided by the squared magnitude of s 5 ε 1 s 2 d s for more information on the derivation see hahn and iaccarino 2009 in this study the adaptive method is used in conjunction with the linear upwind discretisation scheme termed luds following the difference in eq 4 is calculated as the difference between cds and luds especially if the adaptive method is used in conjunction with high order convection hoc schemes abrupt local unphysical changes of the sign of may occur in the vicinity of the vortex core see feder and abdel maksoud 2016a for that it is important to modify the adaptive method an appropriate solution is using the absolute value of 6 s ε s this still scales with the magnitude of the numerical diffusion and always points along s hence convects the vorticity back to the vortex centre and acts against numerical diffusion furthermore the vc source term will be restricted to the vicinity of the vortex therefore the local vortex identification criterion λ 2 will be used see jeong and hussain 1995 for λ 2 0 the adaptive source term will be set to zero the influence of the modified source term according to eq 6 and due to the restriction of the vc source term have been analysed by feder and abdel maksoud 2016b the following remarks concern the settings of the vc method within the simulations as the vc source term would introduce huge errors applied in the boundary layer flow the vicinity of the wing is excluded the vc source term is faded linearly after a wall distance of d 0 01 m within the layer 0 01 m d 0 02 m besides the source term is switched off near the inlet x c 2 and outlet x c 35 boundaries furthermore in order to smooth the sudden impact due to the activation of the model the source term is faded in linearly in time within 0 01 s after the simulation without vc has converged 3 5 boundary conditions for grid based methods the boundary conditions bcs are defined straightforward with the exception of those for the walls of the wind tunnel these walls may either be modelled by a no slip bc to represent the real wind tunnel flow with a closed test section or by a slip bc to save computational effort the modelling of the boundary layer flow on the wind tunnel walls is expensive because a fine mesh is required fig 6 a shows the standard hexpress mesh presented in fig 2 used with a slip bc on the walls and subfigure b shows the modified mesh that contains about 4 7 million cells more corresponding to approximately 80 to treat the wind tunnel walls both meshes are very similar in the vicinity of the wing the no slip bc wind tunnel wall is modelled via high re wall treatment in the results section the influence of the different bcs on the vortex evolution will be analysed see section 4 2 at the inlet the inflow velocity has the fixed value u the pressure was zero at the outlet and satisfies the zero gradient bc both on the wing and at the inlet on the wing surface the no slip boundary condition is enforced at the outlet the zero gradient bc are enforced for velocity k and ω fields wall functions for k and ω proposed in menter et al 2003b are applied on the wing for the high re number icem grids 3 6 grid free vortex method as shown below the application of grid based methods encounter difficulties with the accuracy of vortex tip simulation therefore we have also applied the grid free computational vortex method as an alternative to grid based one grid based methods are a very efficient and well developed tool to resolve the turbulent and laminar boundary layers close to the body on the contrary the particle based methods have many difficulties with formulation of boundary conditions and smooth representation of thin near wall flows therefore there are not much applications of vortex methods for real three dimensional configurations at high reynolds numbers however as will be shown further in this paper grid based techniques have a substantial artificial numerical viscosity in the wake resulting in a non realistic damping of vortex structures including tip vortices a natural way to escape these difficulties and to overcome disadvantages of grid based and particle based techniques is the application of domain decomposition close to bodies a grid based method is applied whereas far from the body a grid free one in this paper we use the domain decomposition procedure originally developed by cottet group see cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 sec 8 3 2 to improve the resolution of tip vortices by coupling the vortex method and the openfoam code the domain is decomposed into the upstream zone a and downstream zone b sub domains fig 7 in the zone a the openfoam is used whereas the flow in the zone b is handled using the vortex method the outlet conditions for the a domain solution are taken from the b domain by direct calculation of velocities induced by vortex elements located in b the vorticity is calculated at the interface and flows into the domain b where it is handled by a vortex method the schwartz alternating algorithm is applied to match the solutions in a and b at the interface x x 1 the abscissa x 1 is chosen from the condition that the grid based simulation is quite accurate at x 1 and can be used as an initial solution for the grid free method the vortex elements move and change their strength according to trajectory and vorticity transport equations the particle strength exchange pse method see for instance cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 is applied to take the diffusion effect into account the velocity induced by the wing and the tip vortices located in a a a b zone where a b is the overlapping zone positioned between x 1 and x 2 in the zone b is taken into account by the poincare identity see formula 4 3 19 in cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 or by the sources and dipoles continuously distributed on the faces of the a domain the source and dipole strengths are equal to the normal and tangential velocities on the faces the experience shows that for the problem under consideration an acceptable accuracy is attained if the sources and dipoles are distributed only on the face f i e in the section x x 1 in numerical simulations the continuous distributions are represented by a set of point sources and dipoles located at the centers of grid cell faces within the section x x 1 the distance x 2 x 1 is chosen being equal to the influence length of the source and dipole layers which is relatively short since the velocity induced by them decays as r 2 like all particle based methods the vortex element method runs in unsteady mode the time step is dictated by the accuracy of the calculation of velocities induced at vortex elements by the discrete sources and dipoles a preliminary study revealed that a proper accuracy is attained at the distance of δ m i n δ y δ z from the face f where δ y z are sizes of the cell face at a smaller distance the velocity rapidly increases due to a singular nature of point sources and dipoles larger distances are not desirable because of an overall resolution decrease from this consideration we get the time step estimation δ t δ u the results presented below are obtained using the vortex elements proposed by winckelmans and leonard 1993 which induce the velocity at any point x i according to formula 7 u i x i j 1 m γ j x i j 4 π σ j 3 ρ 5 2 ρ 1 5 2 where x i j x i x j and ρ x i j 2 σ j 2 σ j is a size of the vortex element which was taken as σ β δ where δ is the size of the grid at the outlet of the a subdomain the factor β 2 secures the overlapping between elements vortex elements are distributed nearly uniformly in space to get a proper element overlapping and stability of simulations see cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 to fulfill this requirement the vortices should uniformly be distributed already at the interface b 1 for that the openfoam results obtained on a non uniform grid are mapped onto a uniform grid at each schwartz iteration the openfoam mapped data are used to generate new vortex elements from the grid based solution using the following procedure when the discrete particles are used in the zone b the most natural condition to set the vortex element strength is 8 γ j ω o f x j v o l j where ω o f x j is the vorticity of the grid simulation at point x j and v o l j δ 3 is the volume of cell within which the vorticity is replaced by the j t h vortex element in what follows the index o f stands for quantities of the grid based solution when the resolution grows δ 0 the vortex elements with the strengths 8 induce the velocity u which is the same as the grid solution u o f at moderate δ for strong concentrated vortices there is a big discrepancy between u and u o f namely u o f u to match the velocities at the interface we perform additional adaption at each time instant using the condition of matching between vorticity induced by vortex elements and vorticity of the grid solution 9 u o f u from our experience it is better to use the condition 10 u o f x i p u x i p j 1 m γ j x i j 4 π σ j 3 ρ 5 2 ρ 1 5 2 where p stands for the projection of velocities u onto the grid the equations with unknowns γ j 10 can be solved as a system of 3 3 linear equations however it is a very consuming procedure that is why we project 10 on x axis since the vector γ has a dominant component along x axis and use the iteration process 11 α i m α i m 1 ε u o f x i p j 1 m γ j x i j 4 π σ j 3 ρ 5 2 ρ 1 5 2 i where ε is relaxation and α is amplification parameter once the iteration process is converged the strengths are updated 12 γ j α j m γ j this method which is very similar to the beale s iterative method see cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 pages 208 209 has a very good convergence at moderate overlapping β at large β the accuracy of approximation sufficiently degrades this is the reflection of the singular matrix problem when the radial based functions with a large overlapping are used for approximation the vortex method is used without turbulence model i e in dns direct numerical simulation mode 4 results 4 1 description of the data evaluation procedure numerical results are compared with measurements for the vortex core radius r 1 the peak tangential velocity v θ 1 and the axial velocity at the vortex center u 0 they are extracted from simulations without the correction of vortex wandering which was not documented in simulations although it occurs under real measurement conditions due to instabilities of the wind tunnel flow and small wing oscillations the vortex center at each x position is determined by the local minimum of λ 2 criterion in the x c o n s t plane the difference in results using any other criterion for instance q or λ c i is negligible the axial velocity u 0 is evaluated at the center at each radius r measured from the vortex center the tangential velocity is averaged in circumferential direction the vortex core is defined as the radius r 1 at which the averaged tangential velocity reaches its maximum value the vortex core parameters are analysed at the x positions of the measurements x c 5 10 30 and additionally at x c 1 5 2 3 4 upstream of x c 1 5 the concentrated tip vortex is hard to identify since the roll up process is not completed if the core radius exceeds 0 4 c at large distances from the wing the vortex core parameters are not evaluated because the vortex becomes too smooth and dissipates to a weak level the evaluation of the unsteady simulations starts after 0 6 s in this time the flow passes the distance of interest x c 30 more than three times what is enough to exclude the start up transitional phase the unsteady simulations results are averaged in time within the period of 0 1 s which is large enough to guarantee the convergence of statistical data for a proper validation it is important to compare our results not only with measurements but also with other numerical simulations unfortunately we found only one available simulation data for the devenport et al test case performed by wells et al 2010 who applied various turbulence models to assess their performance in predicting a tip vortex flow the one equation model of spalart allmaras with and without curvature correction and the reynolds stress transport model rsm lrr proposed by launder et al 1975 a structured mesh with 11 9 m cells and wall functions for the resolution of the boundary layer flow on the wing were utilised unfortunately there is no information available on the grid resolution in the vicinity of the vortex core wells determined the tip vortex parameters in a slightly different way than in this study the vortex center is determined by the maximum helicity the tangential velocity profile used to determine r 1 and v θ 1 is evaluated only along one line parallel to the z axis through the vortex core without averaging in circumferential direction the main conclusion of his work is the superiority of the rsm model in comparison with others its application leads to results which match very well the experimental ones at small x c unfortunately no information is presented downstream of x c 10 because of strong dissipation of the tip vortex in the far field 4 2 influence of the boundary condition of the wind tunnel walls this section deals with the influence of different boundary conditions bcs applied to the wind tunnel walls slip or no slip ones devenport et al 1996 observed a slight streamwise pressure gradient d c p d x 0 3 m 1 along the wind tunnel due to the evolution of the boundary layer this obvious phenomenon leads to an acceleration of the flow the question is whether the boundary layer evolution on the tunnel walls needs to be considered for a proper prediction of the tip vortex evolution therefore two simulations will be carried out on the no slip mesh see fig 6b using the sa ddes turbulence model one with a slip and one with a no slip bc realised on the tunnel walls following the high re wall treatment of the tunnel walls the mean max y value is about 95 150 and justifies the use of wall functions for the attached boundary layer flow the numerical settings are similar to the ones used for the hybrid rans les turbulence models on the hexpress slip mesh the influence of the different boundary conditions on the vortex strength until x c 30 is negligible comparing with the no slip condition the core radius increases by about 0 2 and the peak tangential velocity decreases by about 0 8 for the slip condition both values show no clear tendency behind the wing besides the axial velocity at the vortex centre decreases by about 1 4 using the slip condition the difference between the slip and no slip result increases monotonously in the streamwise direction both points are reasonable because the boundary layer evolution accelerates the free flow thus the neglected boundary layer evolution leads to a slight deceleration of the axial vortex flow and can be considered in simulations however the slip bc is proven to be sufficiently accurate for the objective of the current paper comparison of different approaches to predict a tip vortex flow hence it will be used in the following simulations 4 3 comparison of different turbulence models on icem and hexpress meshes 4 3 1 icem mesh fig 8 illustrates the influence of the mesh resolution and the curvature correction for the icem mesh first of all it is to note a strong degradation of the concentrated tip vortex in the far wake field the maximum tangential velocity and consequently the vortex strength losses about two thirds of its initial value whereas the vortex core is spread up with the factor of four and more large discrepancy between measurement and simulations underlines the importance of the problem considered in the present paper simulations are not capable of predicting the tip vortex flows at distances from the wing x c 5 which are relatively moderate and quite typical for marine applications for instance helicoidal tip vortices of propellers interact with rudders in the far vortex wake therefore such a discrepancy makes impossible numerical analysis of some important practical problems for instance of the tip vortex cavitation influence on the rudder erosion in this paper we are going to clear which models and grids are able to improve the simulation accuracy grid independence study showed that convergence is attained on the grid with 7 2 million cells with and without curvature correction models for this resolution the influence of the curvature corrections is positive but insufficient for a radical improvement of the modelling accuracy as seen the confining effect of both curvature correction models on the vortex radius is big at coarse resolution 2 7 m and becomes negligible at finer resolutions it is hard to find any advantage of one model with respect to the other their effects are comparable fig 9 shows the comparison for the core parameters obtained using different turbulence models among these turbulence models lrr yields the best result the reason is that the rsm models take the anisotropy of the flow into account and the consideration of the rotation effects is an inherent part of the modelling unfortunately the application of the rsm has a strong limitation because of numerical instabilities which were documented in our case at meshes finer than 7 2 million cells the most promising results were obtained using no turbulence model termed w o as seen in fig 9 the lowest rate of vortex decay occurs without turbulence modelling followed first by lrr and then by sa ddes fig 8 shows that the turbulence models based on one and two equation eddy viscosity models with curvature correction lead to inferior results the strong decay of the vortex strength and the vortex core spreading downstream of x c 20 illustrated in fig 9 is due to coarsening of the grid at x c 20 here it should be noted that as stated by devenport et al 1996 the flow on the wing and the tip vortex depend on the tripping of the boundary layer on wing at x c 10 for different locations of tripping the radius r 1 is changed between 0 033 and 0 037 whereas without tripping it was 0 038 the tangential velocity is varied between 0 263 and 0 286 being equal to 0 291 without tripping these differences are around ten percent and cannot be used as an explanation of big discrepancy between numerical results with and without turbulence modeling the parameter most affected by the turbulence tripping is the axial velocity since its distribution is strongly dependent of the wing boundary layer which is in turn depends on the flow regime on the wing with tripping the axial velocity deficit u 0 u u is varied between 0 152 and 0 182 whereas it is two times less without tripping 0 086 the latter value is in a good agreement with the solution obtained on the finest mesh without turbulence modelling fig 9 the circulation γ was found using the classical definition γ r v θ d c r where c r is the circle with the radius r c numerical integration along the circle is performed using l 360 points the velocity v θ at the points is calculated using a linear interpolation between neighbouring grid cell centres increase of l doesn t lead to the increase of accuracy because the distance between the integration points is smaller than grid cell size the circulation of the solution without turbulence modelling inside of the tip vortex is higher than this of the solutions based on turbulence models what is in accordance with relations stated above for the tangential velocity outside of the vortex core at r c 0 05 the circulation γ obtained without a turbulence modelling approach is proved to be smaller than these of the turbulent calculations it can be explained as follows as seen in fig 10 the roll up process is not completed up to x c 5 and the circulation continues to grow in the range up to r c 0 5 due to vortex sheet shed from the trailing edge contrary to the turbulent solution the solution without turbulence modelling is very unsteady with creation of vorticity of opposite signs in the vortex sheet the contribution of the sheet vorticity with rotations opposite to this of the tip vortex reduces the growth of the circulation and makes its dependency on r non monotonic as result γ of the w o model solution becomes smaller outside the vortex core increase of resolution in turbulent simulations from 7 2 m to 42 m of cells which reduces the discretisation errors and artificial viscosity show no improvement in the numerical results therefore the superiority of the solution without turbulence modelling leads to the conclusion that this model is physically more relevant than turbulent models and the flow inside the tip vortex is rather laminar than turbulent although the reynolds number is high enough to expect the turbulent character of the flow both on the wing and in the wake this simulation supports the conclusion of devenport et al 1996 that flow in the core is laminar and that velocity fluctuations experienced here are inactive motions produced as the core is buffeted by turbulence from the surrounding wake the shapes of the profiles do change however and at a rate that is not inconsistent with laminar diffusion devenport et al 1996 4 3 2 hexpress mesh fig 11 shows the influence of different turbulence models on the evolution of the tip vortex core parameters both spalart allmaras and k ω sst with curvature correction cc and hybrid models with improved delayed des iddes as well as delayed des ddes models besides the approach without turbulence modelling termed w o is considered too a peculiar point about these results is that sa cc leads to an overprediction of the axial velocity deficit considering both other vortex core parameters shows that the agreement with the experimental results is worst for sa cc model a possible reason is the overestimation of the boundary layer thickness in the spalart allmaras model resulting in overestimation of the vortex radius and axial velocity deficit the use of k ω sst leads to a stronger vortex compared to the result gained with spalart allmaras in case of sst cc and sst iddes but not in case of sst ddes sa ddes is more accurate the strongest vortex and therewith the highest accuracy concerning the core size and the peak tangential velocity is obtained without turbulence modelling compared to sa ddes the core is smaller and the peak tangential velocity is equal comparing the result obtained without turbulence modelling with the experimental one at x c 30 the core radius is about 2 3 times larger the peak tangential velocity is about 29 smaller and the axial velocity is about 8 6 higher the axial velocity deficit is about 45 smaller for the numerical prediction although the deviation of the nondimensional axial velocity deficit between the numerical predictions and the experimental value is quite high around 50 and more the deviation of the predicted axial velocity itself is much lower deviation around 10 considering the mesh refinements of the icem mesh or that of the hexpress mesh in feder and abdel maksoud 2016b the accuracy of the core radius and peak tangential velocity prediction can be significantly increased refining the mesh in the vicinity of the tip vortex for the des models and the approach without turbulence modelling wells 2009 evaluates the simulation results only until x c 10 as he remarks excessive dissipation of the tip vortex further downstream this can be seen in fig 11 especially the decrease of the peak tangential velocity is very high compared to the results obtained within this study nevertheless the accuracy of all three vortex core parameters at x c 5 is very good and the result is clearly superior in comparison to the results obtained here a possible explanation for the decrease between x c 5 and x c 10 is a change in the mesh coarsening unfortunately wells 2009 provides no detailed information concerning the mesh density in the vicinity of the vortex core which would allow to draw more detailed explanations of the difference between both simulations 4 4 potential of adaptive mesh refinement fig 12 shows the icem mesh after the adaptive refinement in the vicinity of the vortex core resulting in the mesh with 30 million of cells the initial mesh before refinement contains 7 2 m of cells the mesh topology at the boundary of vortex is skewed which could cause numerical errors negatively affecting the solution accuracy in the area surrounding the vortex core unfortunately the hope to improve the accuracy of the simulation using amr in the vortex core was not justified as seen in fig 13 the application of the amr has a negligible positive effect on the calculation results 4 5 comparison of results for two meshes 7 2 m icem and 6 0 m hexpress the tangential velocity close to the wing is proportional to the vortex circulation and therefore to the lift the lift coefficient of the wing using the vles w o without turbulence modelling approach on the fine icem mesh 42 million grid points is around 0 46 this value is equal to this obtained from the panel code autowing see kornev 2016 for the cases run on the icem meshes based on two equation turbulence models and the des version the lift coefficient is between approximately 0 41 and 0 42 larger lift for the finer meshes the turbulent simulations on the hexpress grid provide a lift coefficient between approximately 0 45 turbulence models based on sa and vles and 0 47 based on sst which is roughly ten percent higher compared to the icem meshes and similar to c l from the panel method we suppose that at small angle of attack of 5 the lift coefficient should be independent on the viscous effects therefore the results for inviscid flow and flow with and without turbulence modelling should be close to each other a possible reason for the low lift coefficient on the icem grid is the inaccuracy in the turbulent boundary layer modelling using wall functions applied in the buffer zone region between 5 y 30 as a result the boundary layer thickness is overestimated what results in the overestimation of the displacement effects and reduction of the lift coefficient while on the icem grid both models sa cc and k ω sst cc provide almost the same results at moderate and fine resolutions there is a big difference between two models on the hexpress grid see fig 11 this can be explained by different treatment of the boundary layer on the wing on icem grid the inner part of the layer is modelled by wall function making the difference between models negligible when the boundary layer is well resolved the advantage of the k ω sst approach for boundary layer modelling comes into play the thickness of the boundary layer which has a strong impact on the tip vortex core radius is predicted more accurately by the k ω sst model the core radius from sa model is obviously overestimated with respect to both measurement and k ω sst results what leads to the underestimation of the tangential velocity as result the accuracy of the k ω sst cc model outperforms this of the sa cc model with the other words the advantages of the k ω sst cc model are due to advantages of the pure k ω sst model over the pure sa model fig 14 shows the influence of different meshes for two turbulence models k ω sst with curvature correction and spalart allmaras delayed des for the hexpress mesh the length of the mesh cells l in the vicinity of the tip vortex core in the x plane is about l c 0 0088 for the icem mesh with 7 2 m cells the cell size changes in the vicinity of the vortex in the x plane because of the mesh structure the average cell size is approximately l c 0 01074 i e about 22 larger than for the hexpress mesh based on the results gained with the des approach it is clear that the result on the hexpress mesh is superior compared to the one on the icem mesh the core size is smaller the peak tangential velocity is higher and the axial velocity deficit is also smaller all this results in a smaller discrepancy with experimental data for each quantity one reason for the superiority of the hexpress mesh might be the increased mesh density in the vicinity of the vortex core another possible reason is the different wall treatment icem mesh has large y values and requires utilisation of wall functions whereas fine resolution of the turbulence boundary layer is performed on hexpress mesh 4 6 potential of vorticity confinement feder and abdel maksoud showed in feder and abdel maksoud 2016a for the devenport test case that the potential of vc depends on the turbulence modelling for the standard spalart allmaras model the increase of the vortex strength was much less compared to the increase using spalart allmaras delayed des a possible reason for the strong dissipation of the tip vortex is the huge overprediction of turbulence intensity created by the spalart allmaras model this also leads to a small vc source term which is proportional to the vorticity hence the numerical diffusion due to the overprediction of the turbulent viscosity cannot be balanced by vc in this section the potential of the adaptive vc method in conjunction with sa sst iddes and sa sst ddes and an approach without turbulence modelling termed w o is compared the vortex core parameters are shown in fig 15 firstly the influence of vc on the vortex is negligible in case of sa sst iddes compared to the effect in case of sa sst ddes a possible explanation is that the vortex is considerably weaker in case of sa sst iddes without vc about twice the core radius and about two third to three quarter the peak tangential velocity of the result of sa sst ddes hence as the vc source magnitude is proportional to the vorticity the source term is smaller and therewith the effect of vc considering the approaches based on ddes and without turbulence modelling the application of vc leads to a significant reduction of the vortex core radius and a significant increase of the peak tangential velocity besides the axial velocity at the vortex centre is increased also in the following the effect of the vc method will be described in detail using the relative change of the core parameters r 1 and v θ 1 at the measurement points x c 5 10 30 for both iddes turbulence models the effect is negligible less than 2 for the approaches sa ddes sst ddes and without turbulence modelling the core radius is reduced in average by about 9 20 and 32 respectively the peak tangential velocity for these approaches is increased in average by about 10 19 and 17 the results of sa ddes and sst ddes with vc are comparable considering the core size one turbulence model is superior considering the peak tangential velocity the other one is superior however the sst ddes model shows higher accuracy in terms of the axial velocity which leads to its overall superiority the strongest vortex in terms of small core size and high rotational velocity is obtained without turbulence modelling vles approach and vc which leads also to the smallest error compared to the experimental results feder and abdel maksoud 2016b analyse the potential of the adaptive vc method in conjunction with different resolutions of the mesh in the vicinity of the tip vortex therefore the sa ddes turbulence model with the same settings for the same test case is used the results show that the relative change of the core radius and the peak tangential velocity due to the application of the adaptive vc method is nearly equal if the cells in the wake are refined or coarsened by the factor two 4 7 grid free lagrangian simulations using computational vortex method cvm the previous results gained with grid based methods showed that the vortex decay is large in each case compared to the experimental result the reason for that is the inherent numerical diffusion due to insufficient mesh resolution and insufficiently accurate turbulence modelling therefore the potential of grid free vortex methods will be evaluated in this section the algorithm presented in section 3 6 was implemented into openfoam toolkit results obtained using lagrangian simulation are presented in figs 16 and 17 the grid used was uniform with the size δ x y z δ velocity field necessary for inlet conditions at the interface between openfoam and cvm domain was mapped onto the uniform grid the ordinary differential equations describing the particle motion are integrated using the predictor corrector or euler corrected method with the trapezoidal rule as mentioned above the time step δ t is chosen so that the particles paths close to the interface within δ t is around δ i e δ t m i n δ u u x where u x is the perturbation velocity induced by vortex and wing in simulations presented below it was around δ t 1 04 10 4 s to reduce the computational time the number of vortex element is limited when the vortices are identified at the interface f from the openfoam solution only vortices with the vorticity magnitude larger than 10 percent of the maximum vorticity enter into the domain b the discrete vortices at the interface f at x c 4 are determined on the uniform grid with the size δ using the matching algorithm described above the grid free simulation was matched with the openfoam grid simulation using k ω sst model with 7 2 m cells at δ c 2 e 2 the computational domain of the vortex method is occupied by 86 500 vortex elements with 61 elements in the tip vortex cross section at x c 4 see fig 16 the vortex core parameters presented in fig 17 were obtained by averaging within 0 01 s the maximum tangential velocity related to that at the interface between the grid based and grid free computational domains is presented a similar ratio is presented for the vortex core radius it should be noted that despite a discrete representation of vorticity by vortex elements the distribution of the velocity and radius remain smooth and regular up to the end of the computational domain excepting a very short initial range close to the interface the reason is the transition of the solution from the grid based to the grid free ones which is still not accurately simulated due to discrete representation of the continuous source and dipole layers and an inaccuracy in matching between two computational domains as seen from fig 17 the radius of the tip vortex is slightly grows by fourteen percent along the whole computational domain at 4 x c 34 the maximum tangential velocity decreases only by seven percent at the end of the domain this is the best numerical solution obtained so far it shows a strong potential of the grid free method to radically improve the quality of numerical simulation of the tip vortex flow however this method has two substantial restrictions first since the method has a sufficiently reduced numerical viscosity the stability of the pure lagrangian simulation can be critical for strong concentrated vortices at large reynolds numbers second improvement of the tip vortex resolution by increase of particle number is limited due to high computational costs when the particle number increasing therefore study of the cvm method properties as well as the development of efficient algorithms will be continued in the future works of the authors 5 conclusions a proper prediction of the tip vortex evolution is a big challenge for computational fluid mechanics despite of many efforts to solve this classical problem having a big practical importance in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics in numerical simulations the tip vortex rapidly degrades loosing its strength and spreads up already at distances of a few dozens of the wing chord as a result numerical analysis of important practical problems for instance of the tip vortex cavitation influence on the rudder erosion with an acceptable accuracy becomes impossible in this paper we tried to find an efficient way to improve the simulation accuracy using different numerical methods grids and turbulence models it was shown that the application of curvature correction cc to standard two equation turbulence models of spalart allmaras and k ω sst improved results at a rate which depends on the grid for the coarse grid the improvement is substantial for fine grids with large y and an approximate treatment of the boundary layers using wall functions the influence of the curvature correction is negligible on the contrary the grids with well resolved boundary layer and small y show a strong sensitivity to curvature corrections the k ω sst model with curvature correction according to smirnov and menter 2009 has a clear advantage over the corrected spalart allmaras model in conjunction with adaptive mesh refinement amr these turbulence models showed insignificant improvement for fine grid resolution the performance of the detached eddy simulation models like ddes and iddes is proved to be much better than this of the one and two equation turbulence models the highest accuracy among des models is provided by the delayed des approach which prevents the vortex from large diffusion the highest accuracy among all u rans turbulence models is attained with the lrr reynolds stress transport models rsm which takes the anisotropy of the turbulent wake into account and the rotation effects are an inherent part of modelling in this technique the most promising results among grid based methods were obtained using the approach without turbulence modelling which can be classified as an underresolved very large eddy simulation without a subgrid model the superiority of this solution leads to the conclusion that the used turbulence models do not reproduce the flow relaminarization in the vicinity of the tip vortex core which is the reason for the very slow tip vortex decay this simulation supports the conclusion of devenport et al 1996 that the flow in the core is laminar and that velocity fluctuations experienced here are inactive motions produced as the core is buffeted by turbulence from the surrounding wake this fact explains also the improvement of numerical solution when des is applied indeed in des the turbulent viscosity within the tip vortex is reduced by switching the turbulent solution to les one in this way the total viscosity approaches to the laminar one and the accuracy of the numerical solution is improved the potential of the adaptive vorticity confinement method depends on the underlying turbulence model its application reinforced the vortex flow but also can lead to an acceleration of the axial flow component a further extensive investigation is needed to determine the drive mechanism for this acceleration to further reduce the artificial vortex diffusion a pure lagrangian grid free vortex method is applied to simulate the tip vortex dynamics in the far wake grid free simulation is coupled with the grid based one in the near wake where the vortex diffusion can be considered as small the flow on the wing and in the near wake is treated using grid based method whereas the remaining flow part is calculated using the grid free approach grid free vortex method provides the most promising results showing the lowest rate of the vortex strength decay and vortex core spreading however this method has two substantial restrictions firstly since the method has a sufficiently reduced numerical viscosity the stability of the pure lagrangian simulation can be critical for strong concentrated vortices at large reynolds numbers second improvement of the tip vortex resolution by increase of particle number is limited due to high computational costs when the particle number increasing further development of the grid free vortex and grid based vortex confinement methods as well as their coupling seem to be a very promising way for a radical improvement of the accuracy of tip vortex dynamics

environments including pile foundations spudcans and anchors gaudin et al 2011 zhu et al 2012 bao et al 2014 abbasa et al 2015 tian et al 2015 since these structures are subjected to repeated environmental loadings such as wave or wind loadings cyclic response needs to be taken into consideration in the design of these foundations marine clay deposits generally in a sedimentary environment and usually formed specific structure during tens of thousands of years the influence of this special structure especially when subjected to cyclic loads is one of the major concerns in the design of foundations for marine and onshore structures many experimental studies have been conducted on response of clays due to cyclic or repeated loads in the last few decades sangrey et al 1978 procter and khaffaf 1984 ansal and erken 1989 hyde et al 1993 matasovic and vucetic 1995 zhou and gong 2001 li et al 2011 gu et al 2012 wichtmann et al 2013 the results of these studies indicate that the soil response are progressive the effective stress and pore water pressure depend on several factors which can be classified into two categories 1 loading conditions including cyclic stress level loading frequency and loading directions and 2 soil characteristics including over consolidation ratio stress status and atterberg limits however to authors best knowledge researches that focused on the influence of soil structure on shanghai marine clay under repeated loads are quite limited burland 1990 reported that the soil structure could make a significant difference on mechanical properties between natural undisturbed and artificial remoulded clay thus they have proposed the concept of porosity index to measure soil structure influence leroueil and vaughan 1990 summarized previous studies and concluded that the soil structure led to a stiffer and lower compression property of soil and the soil structure should be treated as a basic concept of equal importance to initial void ratio and stress history many other static experimental researches were conducted considering the influence of the soil structure amorosi and rampello 2007 callisto and calabresi 1998 cotecchia and chandler 1998 gasparre et al 2007 the results of these studies all indicated that the soil structure had a significant influence on the soil properties from the experimental results many structure

procedures of cyclic triaxial test schemes are presented in this section strain development effective stress path and pore water pressure of both samples that subjected to cyclic loads were measured and analyzed in section 3 to facilitate engineering practice a partition diagram is proposed to evaluate the accumulated pore water pressure of clay in different sensitivities based on the test data and results main conclusions are given in section 4 2 shanghai marine clay and laboratory testing scheme 2 1 shanghai marine clay shanghai is located in the southern edge of the yangtze river delta in east china in the past 20 000 years with the rise of sea level a large amount of fine sediments carried by the yangtze river have been deposited and formed the modern yangtze river delta shanghai clays are typical soft deltaic deposits with a thickness of 30 40 m the clays are almost horizontally distributed representing a fully holocene transgression regression sequence in the yangtze delta area the clays can be divided into five major layers and each layer possesses different physical and mechanical characteristics due to differences in depositional history wu et al 2015 in this study layer 4 of shanghai clay which is a typical marine soft clay with a high water content and a low strength was chosen for experiment soil samples were taken from a construction site at songjiang district shanghai all samples were obtained from the same layer about 11 13 m deep the physical properties of the soil are as follows specific gravity g s 2 7 water content w 48 liquid limit w l 50 plastic limit w p 22 plasticity index i p 28 compression index c c 0 44 initial void ratio e 0 1 30 and natural density ρ 1 74 103 kg m3 2 2 remoulded clay to achieve fully disturbed and remoulded clay the undisturbed sample was crushed from clay lump to powder by artificial vibrations water was then added and mixed thoroughly so as to form slurry the water content of the slurry was kept above twice the liquid limit this slurry was transferred to a cylindrical mould of 150 mm diameter with 400 mm height and then it was consolidated by applying vertical stress of 100 kpa which was the pre consolidation pressure of the natural clay after the consolidation drainage was completed the remoulded clay sample was completed 2 3 test procedure both undisturbed clay and remoulded clay were made to samples with 50 mm diameter and 100 mm height the samples were isotopically consolidated under an effective confining stress of 100 kpa as in previous experimental studies on clays ye et al 2013 2015 the isotropic consolidation took about 5 6 days full saturation was confirmed by measuring the skempton s b value which was required to be greater than 0 96 in this study a cyclic undrained test with a sinusoidal wave was performed after consolidation in the cyclic tests a cyclic two way axial loading was applied in a load controlled mode using a pneumatic loading system a servo control system made sure the stability of the loading wave in order to obtain the threshold cyclic stress ratio of shanghai marine clay which referred to a minimum value for a failure of specimens tests with different frequencies f 0 02 hz 0 5 hz 2 hz and cyclic stress ratios r c 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 were performed the cyclic stress ratio is defined as the ratio of the cyclic axial stress to twice the confining pressure expressed as 1 r c σ d 2 σ s in which σ d is the cyclic axial stress and σ s is the confining pressure to investigate the influence of soil structure on dynamic response tests with remoulded samples were performed using a loading frequency of f 0 02 hz the tests were terminated when the double amplitude axial strain ε d reached 10 in this study the cyclic axial strain ε a all be taken for double amplitude strain ε d table 1 summarises the test scheme and the number of cycles n at which the tests were terminated 3 test results and discussion 3 1 development of axial strain and threshold cyclic stress ratio the relationships between double amplitude strain ε d and cyclic numbers n of both undisturbed and remoulded samples are plotted in fig 1 it can be observed from fig 1 a that the relationship between double ε d and n depends on the variation of the cyclic stress ratio when the cyclic stress ratio reached 0 2 the strain increased slowly in the first few cycles then increased more abruptly in the cycles afterwards furthermore the strain development curves had an inflexion when the strain ε d reached the inflexion the soil strength declined rapidly and happened to failure finally however there would be a significant difference in the curve of the cyclic stress ratios of 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 in comparison to r c 0 1 the strain ε d grew slowly with the increase in the numbers of cycles and was still very small until being loaded 10 000 times the strain curves of remoulded samples presented similar development pattern as that in fig 1 b table 1 summarises the test scheme and the number of cycles n at which the tests were terminated in the test scheme undisturbed samples tests with different frequencies f 0 02 hz 0 5 hz 2 hz with cyclic stress ratios r c 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and remoulded samples tests with frequencies f 0 02 hz having different cyclic stress ratios r c 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 were performed in the undisturbed samples tests when the cyclic stress ratio was lower than 0 2 the strain accumulated very slowly and was in a small level 0 5 even when the number of cycles reached 10 000 with different frequencies f 0 02 hz 0 5 hz 2 hz the data shows that the threshold cyclic stress ratio of shanghai clay exists and is between 0 1 and 0 2 on the other hand in the remoulded samples tests when the cyclic stress ratio was lower than 0 2 the strain also stayed in a small level as the same with the undisturbed samples tests it can be concluded that the structure of clay had minor influence on the threshold cyclic stress ratio 3 2 effective stress path fig 2 shows the effective stress paths of both undisturbed and remoulded samples it can be observed that shear stress q oscillated under cyclic stress and the mean effective stress p reduced it also can be seen that the effective stress paths of undisturbed samples showed a more ductile behaviour than those of remoulded samples the stress path number of the undisturbed samples was much more than the number of the remoulded samples meanwhile the mean effective stress p of undisturbed samples declined more rapidly especially in the first few cycles and was smaller finally on the other hand the mean effective stress p of remoulded samples almost reduced uniformly with the numbers of cycles in the conditions of cyclic stress ratio r c 0 2 and 0 3 the mean effective stress p of undisturbed samples declined with the growth of shear stress q in the former cycles as shown in fig 2 a and c however for the remoulded samples the mean effective stress p increased with the increasing of shear stress q as shown in fig 2 b and d in each cyclic load the results indicated that the remoulded samples generated little pore water pressure and made a remarkable mean effective stress initially due to the loss of soil structure furthermore when the samples happened to failure undisturbed samples had similar effective stress path shape with remoulded samples the area of the effective stress path became larger and larger and an inflexion occurred in the effective stress path with the decrease in mean effective stress p 3 3 development of pore water pressure the relationships between maximum pore water pressure u m and cyclic numbers of both undisturbed and remoulded samples are presented in fig 3 a it can be seen that the original maximum pore water pressure u m of remoulded samples were almost same under different cyclic stress ratio however the original maximum pore water pressure of undisturbed samples rose with the cyclic stress ratio it may be due to the various pore water pressure amplitudes therefore the residual pore water pressure u r the average pore water pressure and the oscillatory pore water pressure u o the pore water pressure amplitude were analyzed separately fig 3 b shows the residual pore water pressure u r increased with the growth of strain ε d as can be observed the residual pore water curves of undisturbed samples and remoulded samples presented similar development pattern residual pore water pressure u r rose rapidly with the growth of strain at the early stage then increase more slowly afterwards however under the same cyclic stress ratio the undisturbed samples had larger residual pore water pressure than the remoulded samples fig 3 c shows the relationships between the oscillatory pore water pressure u o and strain ε d in the initial stage of strain development the oscillatory pore water pressures of both undisturbed samples and remoulded samples developed rapidly then the oscillatory pore water pressures of undisturbed samples tended to be stable on the contrary the oscillatory pore water pressures of remoulded samples accumulated constantly in addition the oscillatory pore water pressures of undisturbed samples were larger than the oscillatory pore water pressure of remoulded samples the main difference between undisturbed soil and remoulded soil is in the soil structure so it can be concluded that the soil structure had a significant influence on the development of pore water pressure 3 4 residual pore water evaluated by strain and cyclic stress ratio the structure of clay is generally quantified by the sensitivity s t the sensitivity of remoulded clay is defined as 1 in this study the sensitivity of the undisturbed shanghai marine clay was measured by unconfined compression tests the sensitivity of structural clay is defined as the ratio of unconfined compressive strength of undisturbed sample to that of remoulded sample from the unconfined compression tests the unconfined compressive strength of undisturbed sample was 51 4 kpa and that of remoulded sample was 10 2 kpa furthermore the measured sensitivity st of shanghai marine clay was 5 the residual pore water pressure u r has strong correlation with the effective stress and has obvious influence on the soil strength hence the residual pore water pressure analysis need to be focused on in the analysis of soil structure influence on dynamic response fig 4 shows the relationships between the residual pore water pressure u r and strain ε d in different cyclic stress ratio r c and sensitivity s t it can be seen that the residual pore water pressure strain diagram can be categorized into three regions by strain 1 when the strain was less than 0 5 where the cyclic stress ratio was lower than the threshold cyclic stress ratio 2 when the strain was between 0 5 and 2 in this region the residual pore water pressure was not large and increased rapidly 3 when the strain was larger than 2 in this region the residual pore water pressure was large and rose slowly it can be concluded that the residual pore water pressure had different development pattern in various strain ranges of 0 0 25 and 0 25 2 25 and greater than 2 25 as expressed in fig 4 in addition the diagram can also be categorized by cyclic stress ratio it can be summarized that the residual pore water pressure would shift upward with the increasing of sensitivity in all cyclic stress ratio of ranges between 0 and 17 kpa 17 kpa 51 kpa and greater than 51 kpa therefore the final residual pore water pressure in different sensitivity can be obtained qualitatively under the certain cyclic stress ratio besides the final residual pore water pressure range under various cyclic stress ratios can also be offered such as larger than 50 kpa with r c 0 2 20 50 kpa with r c 0 3 and 0 5 20 kpa with r c 0 4 with a few more supplementary tests the residual pore water pressure in different sensitivity can be predicted more accurately 4 conclusions in this study the influence of soil structure for soft marine clays is proposed based on cyclic triaxial tests results for both undisturbed and remoulded shanghai marine clay the following conclusion can be drawn from the results presented 1 the double amplitude strain ε d development curves had an inflexion in both undisturbed and disturbed samples when the strain ε d reached the inflexion the soil strength declined rapidly and finally led to failure similarly the soil structure of clay has minor influence on the threshold cyclic stress ratio 2 the mean effective stress p of undisturbed samples declined more rapidly in q p plot and was less than that of remoulded samples meanwhile the effective stress paths of undisturbed samples showed a more ductile behaviour than those of remoulded samples the loss of soil structure in remoulded sample led to generating a little pore water pressure and produced a remarkable mean effective stress initially 3 a residual pore water pressure strain diagram is proposed in which the residual pore water pressure of clay in different sensitivities can be evaluated easily from the axial strain and the cyclic stress ratio in various strain ranges the residual pore water pressure had different development pattern besides in various cyclic stress ratio ranges the residual pore water pressure of clay in different sensitivity can be predicted acknowledgments the authors are grateful for the financial support from the national natural science foundation of china grant no 41602282 and no 41372284

pore water pressure u m and cyclic numbers of both undisturbed and remoulded samples are presented in fig 3 a it can be seen that the original maximum pore water pressure u m of remoulded samples were almost same under different cyclic stress ratio however the original maximum pore water pressure of undisturbed samples rose with the cyclic stress ratio it may be due to the various pore water pressure amplitudes therefore the residual pore water pressure u r the average pore water pressure and the oscillatory pore water pressure u o the pore water pressure amplitude were analyzed separately fig 3 b shows the residual pore water pressure u r increased with the growth of strain ε d as can be observed the residual pore water curves of undisturbed samples and remoulded samples presented similar development pattern residual pore water pressure u r rose rapidly with the growth of strain at the early stage then increase more slowly afterwards however under the same cyclic stress ratio the undisturbed samples had larger residual pore water pressure than the remoulded samples fig 3 c shows the relationships between the oscillatory pore water pressure u o and strain ε d in the initial stage of strain development the oscillatory pore water pressures of both undisturbed samples and remoulded samples developed rapidly then the oscillatory pore water pressures of undisturbed samples tended to be stable on the contrary the oscillatory pore water pressures of remoulded samples accumulated constantly in addition the oscillatory pore water pressures of undisturbed samples were larger than the oscillatory pore water pressure of remoulded samples the main difference between undisturbed soil and remoulded soil is in the soil structure so it can be concluded that the soil structure had a significant influence on the development of pore water pressure 3 4 residual pore water evaluated by strain and cyclic stress ratio the structure of clay is generally quantified by the sensitivity s t the sensitivity of remoulded clay is defined as 1 in this study the sensitivity of the undisturbed shanghai marine clay was measured by unconfined compression tests the sensitivity of structural clay is defined as the ratio of unconfined compressive strength of undisturbed sample to that of remoulded sample from the unconfined compression tests the unconfined compressive strength of undisturbed sample was 51 4 kpa and that of remoulded sample was 10 2 kpa furthermore the measured sensitivity st of shanghai marine clay was 5 the residual pore water pressure u r has strong correlation with the effective stress and has obvious influence on the soil strength hence the residual pore water pressure analysis need to be focused on in the analysis of soil structure influence on dynamic response fig 4 shows the relationships between the residual pore water pressure u r and strain ε d in different cyclic stress ratio r c and sensitivity s t it can be seen that the residual pore water pressure strain diagram can be categorized into three regions by strain 1 when the strain was less than 0 5 where the cyclic stress ratio was lower than the threshold cyclic stress ratio 2 when the strain was between 0 5 and 2 in this region the residual pore water pressure was not large and increased rapidly 3 when the strain was larger than 2 in this region the residual pore water pressure was large and rose slowly it can be concluded that the residual pore water pressure had different development pattern in various strain ranges of 0 0 25 and 0 25 2 25 and greater than 2 25 as expressed in fig 4 in addition the diagram can also be categorized by cyclic stress ratio it can be summarized that the residual pore water pressure would shift upward with the increasing of sensitivity in all cyclic stress ratio of ranges between 0 and 17 kpa 17 kpa 51 kpa and greater than 51 kpa therefore the final residual pore water pressure in different sensitivity can be obtained qualitatively under the certain cyclic stress ratio besides the final residual pore water pressure range under various cyclic stress ratios can also be offered such as larger than 50 kpa with r c 0 2 20 50 kpa with r c 0 3 and 0 5 20 kpa with r c 0 4 with a few more supplementary tests the residual pore water pressure in different sensitivity can be predicted more accurately 4 conclusions in this study the influence of soil structure for soft marine clays is proposed based on cyclic triaxial tests results for both undisturbed and remoulded shanghai marine clay the following conclusion can be drawn from the results presented 1 the double amplitude strain ε d development curves had an inflexion in both undisturbed and disturbed samples when the strain ε d reached the inflexion the soil strength declined rapidly and finally led to failure similarly the soil structure of clay has minor influence on the threshold cyclic stress ratio 2 the mean effective stress p of undisturbed samples declined more rapidly in q p plot and was less than that of remoulded samples meanwhile the effective stress paths of undisturbed samples showed a more ductile behaviour than those of remoulded samples the loss of soil structure in remoulded sample led to generating a little pore water pressure and produced a remarkable mean effective stress initially 3 a residual pore water pressure strain diagram is proposed in which the residual pore water pressure of clay in different sensitivities can be evaluated easily from the axial strain and the cyclic stress ratio in various strain ranges the residual pore water pressure had different development pattern besides in various cyclic stress ratio ranges the residual pore water pressure of clay in different sensitivity can be
