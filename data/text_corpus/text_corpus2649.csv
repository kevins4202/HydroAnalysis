13245,three different ion exchange resins amberlyst 15 36 and ir120 were used as heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification of the secondary sludge lipids catalyst performance was evaluated based on the biodiesel yield and quality the best biodiesel yield with the best properties was obtained with amberlyst ir120 microwaves mw and ultrasounds us were studied as a pre treatment step to increase lipid extraction us treatment shows the highest biodiesel yield providing a biodiesel that fulfils the current regulations the sludge particle size effect was also studied obtaining the best results using the smallest one however in these conditions ultrasound damage the lipids decreasing the biodiesel yield temperature and catalyst sludge ratio have been optimized the maximum biodiesel yield 32 9 fames lipids was obtained with amberlyst ir120 catalyst sludge ratio 1 2 meoh sludge ratio 33 1 120 c 21 h reaction time and us as pre treatment the catalyst was also reused for six times under the optimal reaction conditions with negligible catalytic activity loss graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biodiesel sewage sludge heterogeneous catalysis ion exchange resins pre treatments 1 introduction despite its environmental and technological advantages biodiesel mainly fatty acids methyl esters fames is usually more expensive than petroleum based diesel especially when it is produced from vegetable oils or animal fats 1 in addition its current manufacture competes with the food industry since it is synthesized from edible oils and fats 2 therefore new raw materials are needed for reducing costs and avoid competition with food supply in this way several authors propose the use of waste cooking oil 3 4 or microalgae 5 9 as raw materials another potential feedstock is sewage sludge a by product of biological wastewater treatment plants the fatty acid content of the sludge is mainly in the range of c10 to c18 which can yield appropriate biodiesel qualities 10 wastewater treatment plants produce large quantities of sludge as a by product which make them a good feedstock for biodiesel production previous studies have demonstrated the potential of sewage sludge as feedstock by in situ transesterification with acid or basic homogeneous catalyst but both methods have several drawbacks in the case of basic catalysts when free fatty acids ffa are present soap formation can take place consuming the catalyst and reducing biodiesel yields 11 on the other hand homogeneous acid catalysts provide a lower reaction rate as well as important corrosion problems 12 to overcome the drawbacks of homogeneous catalysts heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed these catalysts improve the transesterification efficiency and enable catalyst separation and reutilization 13 although there are several studies about the use of heterogeneous catalysts very few propose sludge as raw material when the ffa content is higher than 1 an alkali catalyst is not recommended since the reaction is inhibited by the ffas leading to soap formation 14 15 for this reason recent advances are focused on heterogeneous acid catalysts since they provide several advantages such as high catalytic efficiency removal of biodiesel washing step ease of recovery and reuse and reducing corrosion of reactors 16 siddiquee et al and zhang et al checked different acid heterogeneous catalysts under a two step process extraction reaction siddiquee et al obtained a biodiesel yield of 30 14 based on lipids using sba 15 impregnated with a heteropolyacid pw12 as catalyst without studying the catalyst reuse 17 zhang and co workers prepared different so4 2 al2o3 sno2 catalysts reporting biodiesel yields close to 73 weight of biodiesel product weight of dried crude fat also without catalyst reuse 18 on the other hand melero et al studied the catalytic behaviour of the acid catalyst zr sba 15 obtaining a maximum fames yield of 15 5 fames dry sludge demonstrating the high potential of the catalyst 19 in this case they also studied the catalyst reusability in a second consecutive run with negligible decreases of the fames yields although the use of heterogeneous catalysts for sludge based processes is scarce solid acid catalysts were proposed for biodiesel production from common oils zeolites organic polymers acidic ion exchange resins heteropolyacids etc many of these studies are focussed on the esterification of fatty acids using ion exchange resins as catalysts since they present good properties in terms of esterification efficiency 11 20 22 acidity seems to be a determining factor in transesterification reactions therefore strong acidic ion exchange resins are an attractive alternative 1 with appropriate thermal and mechanical stability 11 on the other hand resins are more hydrophobic than other inorganic materials which is also considered as a key factor for these reactions 23 however to the best of our knowledge ion exchange resins have not been used before for sludge transesterification although catalyst selection is a key parameter to obtain a good esterification efficiency biodiesel yield also depends on the extraction process of the lipids present in the sludge the extraction is carried out with an organic solvent but it can be improved by different physical processes for promoting mass transfer from sludge particles to the liquid medium microwaves and ultrasounds among other pre treatments have been used to increase lipids extraction 24 25 although it has been shown that these pre treatments increase the lipid extraction yield there is no agreement about the best technique as it is highly dependent on the considered raw material on the other hand since the extraction depends on the contact between the sludge and the organic solvent milling and sieving of the raw material could increase the mass transfer thus increasing the extraction capacity for this reason a study about the particle size effect is also interesting in the present study three different ion exchange resins amberlyst 15 36 and ir120 with different physico chemical properties were selected as heterogeneous acid catalysts for biodiesel production from sewage sludge by in situ transesterification the screening was performed to select the catalyst providing the best results both in terms of yield and quality of the resulting biodiesel the effect of reaction conditions such as temperature catalyst loading as well as catalyst reusability for several reaction cycles were also studied analysing the results based on biodiesel yield and quality an additional investigation was done to determine the effect of pre treatments microwaves and ultrasound and the effect of sludge particle size on the performance and quality of the biodiesel 2 materials and methods samples of floating sludge correspond to the sewage treatment plant of la reguerona in gijón spain three different commercial resins were used as heterogeneous acid catalyst amberlyst 15 a 15 sigma aldrich amberlyst 36 a 36 sigma aldrich and amberlyst ir120 a ir120 merck chloroform 99 8 baker was used for determining the total lipid content in the sludge samples for the in situ transesterification process methanol meoh 99 8 vwr was employed as solvent sodium hydroxide 98 sigma aldrich and sodium chloride 99 sigma aldrich were used to titrate the catalyst acid sites a commercial mixture of 37 fames from c4 to c24 supplied by supelco was used for identification and quantification of the fatty acid methyl esters fames 2 1 sample preparation and characterization the total lipid content was determined according to the method proposed by siddiquee and rohani 26 this method uses chloroform 99 8 j t baker as solvent with a dry sludge solvent ratio of 1 g 25 ml at 75 c for 4 h under stirring after extraction the samples were filtered and residual particles were removed by centrifugation using a kubota 6500 centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 min the solvent of the supernatant was removed in a heidolph vv 2000 rotavapor at 70 c and the lipids were weighted in order to obtain the lipid content expresses as lipid g dry sludge g the swelling capacities were obtained according to the method proposed by özbay et al 1 the resins were dried in an oven at 105 c then a volume of each resin was placed into a measured tube and methanol was added the contact was kept at 50 60 c for 2 h and the initial and final volume of the resins were measured percentage of swelling can be calculated according to the following equation 1 swelling swollen volume initial volume 100 2 2 catalyst characterization the textural characterization of the resins was based on nitrogen adsorption tests and performed in a micromeritics asap 2020 surface analyser the catalysts acidity was measured by acid base titration following the method proposed by melero et al with naoh as ion exchange agent 27 2 3 experimental procedure the reactions were carried out by in situ transesterification in a 0 5 l stirred batch autoclave reactor with a pid temperature controller and a back pressure regulator autoclave engineers mawp 5500 psi three different ion exchange resins were checked as catalyst amberlyst 15 36 and ir120 for the study of the different catalysts the reactor was loaded with 0 3 l of methanol and meoh sludge ratio of 33 1 and sludge catalyst ratio of 2 1 following the optimum ratio proposed by carrero et al 2 the reactor was heated up to the desired temperature 120 c while stirring at 1000 rpm using a reaction time of 21 h long enough to ensure maximum lipid extraction has been achieved once the optimal catalyst has been selected different pre treatments were checked for maximizing extraction efficiency microwaves at 2450 mhz for 10 min and sonication at 10 khz during 50 min the sludges underwent these pre treatments before being introduced in the transesterification reactor 28 on the other hand since the sludge particle size can affect the extraction step three different fractions 50 100 μm 100 255 μm and 255 350 μm were tested in all cases experiments were performed at the same experimental conditions that the catalyst selection experiments to optimize the experimental conditions different temperatures were studied from 40 c to 120 c whereas different catalyst sludge ratios was also tested 1 1 1 2 and 1 4 2 4 fames analysis product distribution was evaluated by gas chromatography the qualitative analysis of fames was analysed using a shimadzu gc ms qp2010 plus with a trb 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm column 1 μl of the sample was injected with a split ratio of 30 injection port temperature was kept at 260 c ms source at 200 c and interface temperature 250 c column temperature was operated to start at 100 c kept for 5 min then raised from 100 c to 240 c with a rate of 4 c min and held at this temperature for 30 min the quantitative analysis was carried out using a shimadzu gc2010 with a fid detector and a cp sil 8cb 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm column the detector temperature was 260 c and the temperature program was the same than for the qualitative analysis fames yield φfame was calculated according to the eq 2 expressed as g fame g lipid 2 φ fame c i fame v t tl 100 where ci fame is the concentration of all detected fames vt the total volume and tl the total lipid content 2 5 biodiesel properties the main physicochemical properties of biodiesel produced were obtained since these properties are closely related to the composition profile of the obtained fames all the physicochemical properties long chain saturated factor lcsf saponification value sv degree of unsaturation du cold filter plugging point cfpp iodine number in kinematic viscosity density higher heating value hhv and cetane number cn were estimated according to the equations shown in different articles 4 29 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst selection the reaction profile for the different catalysts is shown in fig 1a the activity of the studied catalysts expressed as fames lipids yield decreases in the order a ir120 21 23 a 36 20 20 a 15 14 98 results obtained for a ir120 and a 36 are very similar reaching the maximum biodiesel yield after 16 h reaction time in the case of a 15 the slope obtained during the first 16 h is much lower but the yield also stabilizes after this reaction time taking into account the catalysts properties table 1 surface acidity and pore diameter are the key parameters governing catalyst performance among these two properties acidity has the most evident effect since in the case of a 36 and a ir120 although a 36 presents the highest particle diameter the final yield obtained is lower than for a ir120 the catalyst with the highest acidity when the fames yield is normalized per acid sites an opposite trend than the described in fig 1a is obtained a ir120 8 23 a 36 9 27 a 15 14 41 this fact indicates that even though a ir120 has a higher acidity value not all active sites are used in the selective fames production obtained results suggest that diffusional effects on the resins play a key role in the catalyst performance which is consistent with the large molecular size of the triglycerides involved in the reaction thus the low porosity material that also has the acid sites in the external surface present the best performance whereas in the case of mesoporous materials a large fraction of the acid sites is not fully accessible to the reactants on the other hand previous studies have demonstrated that resins with lower crosslinking have higher swelling capacity which affects positively in the esterification rate 1 the swelling capacity follows the order a ir120 37 a 36 22 a 15 10 which matches with the trends observed for the biodiesel yields thus high acidity and swelling capacity play a more determinant role than the other morphological parameters this fact is congruent with the low esterification rate obtained with a 15 with higher surface area and mesoporous volume but lower acidity and swelling capacity besides park et al found that the water produced during the esterification reaction acts as inhibitor form the acid sites of the resin a 15 22 they also compared a 15 with a bd20 a resin with similar sbet and vmeso than a 36 for which they obtained better results since the interaction of the acid sites with the released water is weaker keeping constant its activity 22 3 2 biodiesel quality the feasibility of a process based on wastewater sludge for obtaining biodiesel will depend not only on the fame yield but also on the quality of the resulting biodiesel obviously this quality will mainly depend on the raw sludge but catalyst can also play a role in these properties the fames profile obtained for each catalyst is shown in fig 1b in all cases the percentage of saturated fames is similar and close to 90 although the ratio between saturated and unsaturated fames can influence the biodiesel quality the optimal ratio has not been stablished yet 33 saturated fames offer better burning properties meanwhile unsaturated ones are associated with better fluidity under cold temperature 34 the fames profile is similar for a 15 and a ir120 for which the biodiesel obtained is predominantly composed of methyl esters of palmitic acid c16 0 and stearic acid c18 0 in the case of a 36 the proportion of palmitic acid decreases increasing the amount of the methyl ester of c15 0 this unexpected effect suggests a specific interaction of the triglycerides with the catalyst probably because of the abovementioned diffusional effects these effects are negligible in the a ir120 catalyst but not for the others this differentiation could be attributed to the difficulty of the compounds to access the active centers as the catalysts have different pore diameter table 1 from the fames profile the biofuel properties can be determined to study the viability of the biofuel obtained according to the standard specification for biodiesel fuel by astm d975 and en 590 table s1 the biodiesel obtained with the three different catalysts are quite similar the main differences are related to the iodine number in kinematic viscosity ηi and higher heating value hhv although astm d975 and en 590 provide no specifications for in en14111 specified a maximum value of 120 the values obtained in this study follow the order a 36 8 12 a 15 9 71 a ir120 10 41 and all of them are far from the maximum recommended in the case of the kinematic viscosity one important parameter that define the capability of fuel only the biofuel obtained with a ir120 as catalyst meets the requirements of the standard specifications with a value of 2 03 mm2 s although there is no standard requirement in the case of hhv the typical value for a diesel is close to 49 mj kg and it was found to be between 39 and 43 for biodiesel from different raw materials 35 in this case for a ir120 the value is close to that obtained for mineral diesel whereas a 15 provides a fuel more similar to conventional biodiesel in the case of a 36 the value obtained is higher than that obtained for mineral diesel in relation with the other parameters with standard specifications saponification value sv density and cetane number cn in all cases the values obtained comply with the standards without significant differences among the three catalysts as for the other properties there is not regulation fixed values for degree of saturation du since it is not a final property of biofuels long chain saturated factor lcsf is in the same situation regarding the cold filter plugging point cfpp in these cases the value is close to 58 c the cfpp for diesel fuel is between 0 and 12 c but in the case of biodiesel it is usually higher and depends on the raw material so it will be necessary additives to decrease cfpp 36 to sum up a ir120 achieved not only the maximum biodiesel yield but also the best biodiesel quality being the only catalyst that complies with all the values set by the regulations for these reasons it is the catalyst selected to carry out the optimization of the transesterification process 3 3 effect of different pre treatments on the biodiesel yield the biodiesel yield not only depends on the transesterification process but also on the extraction process in the samples obtained by the in situ transesterification with a ir120 as catalyst no lipids were detected in the final samples which suggests that all the extracted lipids have been trans esterified therefore the option of a pre treatment to favour the lipids extraction is a good alternative to increase the biodiesel yield thus pre treatments of the sludge with microwaves mw and ultrasounds us were tested for improving the extractability of the sludge as they have been shown to maximize the lipid extraction from biological samples 24 as observed in fig 2a both methods have resulted in improved lipid extraction since the maximum biodiesel yield increases with mw and us these results show that the use of these techniques favour the cellular breakdown and as a consequence larger amounts of lipids were extracted this increase leads to a significant increase in biodiesel yield the increase in the maximum yield obtained was 12 and 3 for mw yield 23 8 and us yield 27 6 respectively in both cases no lipids were detected in the final samples which suggests that all the lipids extracted have been trans esterified which confirms that extraction is a limiting step on the other hand the yield profile fig 2a is quite similar for both pre treatments mw and us during the first hours and the in situ transesterification is faster when these pre treatments are applied since more lipids are available for the transesterification process the maximum biodiesel yield is obtained after 14 h in both cases faster than without pre treatments at this point is also important to mention that no ffas were detected in the final samples which confirms that all the extracted ffas have reacted regarding to the best technique there is no unanimity in the bibliography about which pre treatment achieves a greater improvement being dependent on the raw material and the experimental conditions martinez guerra et al studied the effect of these pre treatments for the extractive transesterification of algal lipids chlorella sp obtaining the highest yield and conversion for mw although both methods produce better results than the conventional one 25 but nevertheless prabakaran and co workers obtained higher lipid content by using the sonication method when compared with mw using chlorella sp and nostoc sp as raw material 37 in this work mw and us are applied on sludge sample after a storage period in waste treatment facility thus these sludges will be more compacted than fresh sludges us pre treatment leads to sludge floccules fragmentation that enhances lipid extraction hence the best performance with us this effect is not so marked with the mw pre treatment 3 4 effect of pre treatments on the biodiesel quality although the best biodiesel yield was obtained with us it is important to check the biodiesel quality in all cases since the different pre treatments could modify the lipidic fraction and consequently the biodiesel quality as observed in fig 2b the fames profile changes when mw and us are used the fraction of palmitic acid methyl esters c16 0 increases with both pre treatments being more marked for the case of mw on the contrary the amount of c15 0 decrease drastically on the other hand with us the percentage of c18 0 increase in a small percentage meanwhile it decreases a bit for mw the fraction of saturated fames decreases from 88 no pre treatment to 85 8 and 85 7 for mw and us respectively the monounsaturated one s increase from 10 9 no pre treatment to 12 4 mw and 12 6 us the greatest difference is obtained in the case of polyunsaturated fames for which the percentage increases from 0 6 no pre treatment to close to 1 2 for mw and us however although polyunsaturated fames can lead to undesired gums formation reactions which decrease the product stability a 1 2 is considered a small percentage that would not cause problems in the interval of plant biodiesel regarding to the fuel properties regulated by the astm d975 and en590 standards table s1 there is a change when using mw as a pre treatment decreasing the kinematic viscosity below the set limits with a value of 1 94 mm2 s table s2 it is not a value very far from the standards but in the case of us it fulfils all the regulation standards this difference in terms of the fuel properties is due to the different effects of both treatments in the lipid extraction in general terms all the properties improve when the studied pre treatments are applied with the exception of the saponification value sv but they are very close to the initial ones 3 5 effect of sludge particle size on the biodiesel yield since it has been demonstrated that extraction is a limit stage it is interesting to carry out the in situ transesterification at different sludge particle sizes as a smaller particle size could favour the extraction process by increasing the contact surface as can be seen in fig 3a the biodiesel yield follows the order 50 100 μm 24 3 no sieving 21 23 100 250 μm 18 6 250 355 μm 15 2 only the particle size of 50 100 μm the smallest one get an improvement in the final yield with an increase in 14 1 even higher than the obtained with mw 23 8 the lipid content of each fraction was analysed without relevant variations in the results therefore the difference in yield cannot be due to a difference in the lipid content but an improvement in the lipid extraction this difference in performance is attributed to the fact that a smaller particle size results in a better sludge solvent contact which lead to greater lipid extraction and higher biodiesel yield since the non pre treated sludge is a mixture of all particle sizes there is not a net improvement of the extraction efficiency comparing the yield of each individual fraction and the whole sludge regarding the yield profile it is quite similar during the first 8 h and the maximum lipid extraction capacity and therefore maximum biodiesel yield was reached after 14 h for 250 355 μm and after 17 h in the case of 50 100 and 100 250 since the biodiesel yield remains constant after 17 h in all cases and no free lipids were detected in the final samples the different lipid availability in each fraction is the main responsible of the observed yield differences since us has resulted in a higher performance they were applied to the different particle sizes to check if this could further increase the maximum yield obtained giving a synergistic effect of both pre treatments sieving and us as observed in fig 3b a decrease in yield between 5 and 10 is observed compared to sieving without ultrasound being larger to smaller particle sizes these results suggest that the us can damage lipid content the smaller the particle size the greater the damage which has already been reported in previous works 38 39 when ultrasound without sieving was used the biodiesel yield was higher since the raw material contains mostly particles greater than 355 μm in fact the raw sludge is composed mainly of larger particles being the small range 50 100 μm the least representative regarding the yield profile as when sieving was checking without us it is quite similar during the first 8 h the difference after this time is due to the different amount of lipids available due to the extraction process which leads to a different final yield in the case of 100 250 and 250 355 μm a constant profile was obtaining after 14 h meanwhile for 50 100 μm it seems that more time is necessary to reach the maximum biodiesel yield 3 6 effect of sludge particle size on the biodiesel quality comparing the fames profile obtained at different particles sizes the c16 0 fraction decreases by increasing the particle size whereas c18 0 increase at increasing particle sizes fig 3c this is due to the different composition depending on the particle size of the sludge since only a differentiation by size has been carried out without modifying the starting raw material or subjecting it to any other treatment the fraction of saturated compounds remains almost constant around 88 but there are small differences in the unsaturated moieties as particle size decreases the resulting biodiesel shows a slightly higher fraction of polyunsaturated and vice versa which implies the opposite effect in the monounsaturated fame yields about the biodiesel properties table s2 these properties hardly differ from the result obtained without sieving except the kinematic viscosity this last parameter is in all cases lower than regulated standards for this reason although smaller sieving results in an increase in the biodiesel yield it is not a good alternative since the kinematic viscosity is found below the standards when sieving and us were combined fig 3d there are no major differences in the fames profile except in the amount of c18 o which increase when us is applied to the particle size 100 250 μm besides taking into account the properties of the final biodiesel shown in table s2 it does not imply an improvement in the fuel quality regarding to the regulated properties the kinematic viscosity remains below the minimum value set by the standards as in the case of the abovementioned treatments 3 7 effects of reaction temperature in situ esterification reactions were carried out at three different temperatures 40 80 and 120 c below to the upper temperature limit of the catalyst operation the catalyst selected was a ir120 with catalyst sludge ratio 1 2 meoh sludge ratio 33 1 for 21 h and us as pre treatment since it was proven to be the best alternative for an increase in the process performance as observed in fig 4 as the temperature increases the biodiesel yield also increases following the order 120 c 27 6 80 c 22 5 40 c 14 5 40 this fact is a good agreement with an endothermic equilibrium limited overall process besides the slope before to reach the maximum biodiesel yield also increase with the temperature so the reaction rate increases with temperature similar trend has been reported by other authors 11 20 21 in the final samples no lipids were detected in any case suggesting that the amount of extracted lipids increases as temperature increases therefore the slope in the biodiesel profile formation rate increases because there are more lipids available for the transesterification reaction therefore temperature plays a key role in the lipids extraction which determines the maximum biodiesel yield in the case of 40 c the maximum biodiesel yield was reached after 8 h reaction time meanwhile for 80 c and 120 c it was achieved after 11 h maximum lipid extraction was reached in all the cases since the biodiesel yield remains constant with the time in the same way negligible lipid presence was detected in the final samples suggesting that lipid extraction efficiency and therefore biodiesel yield increase as temperature increases 3 8 effect of temperature on biodiesel quality as in the previous sections it is also important to study the effect of the reaction temperature on the biodiesel quality fig 4b shows the fames profile at different temperatures in the case of 80 c and 120 c the fames profile is quiet similar with small variations in the amount of c16 0 and c18 0 but it changes drastically for 40 c not only the fames profile changes but also the fames variety at 120 c 17 different fames were obtained 15 at 80 c and only 4 at 40 c c15 0 c16 0 c18 1 and c18 0 which will affect the biodiesel properties when the temperature is lowered to 80 c the profile of saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fames is rather similar on the contrary at 40 c polyunsaturated fames are not obtained and the percentage of monounsaturated decreases from close to 12 at 120 c and 80 c respectively to 1 07 the different biodiesel properties as a function of temperature are shown in table s3 due to the drastic variation in the fames profile and the large decrease in unsaturated ones at 40 c some biodiesel properties are extremely modified such as du in kinematic viscosity and hhv of these properties the only one with a value set by the regulations is the kinematic viscosity which decrease by half far from the minimum set by the standards at 80 c although there is no great variation in the biodiesel properties the highest differences are in the hhv and kinematic viscosity where the latter no longer meets with the regulation thus considering both the biodiesel yield and quality the higher temperature offers the best results 3 9 kinetic modelling a kinetic model is proposed for gaining further understanding about the reaction mechanism and as a starting point for designing purposes the overall transesterification reaction is given by 3 tg 3 meoh 3 fame glycerine due to the large methanol excess its concentration was considered constant and the reaction was considered as irreversible a first order reaction is proposed and the concentration of fames can be obtained according to the eq 4 4 c fames 3 c tgo 1 e k t where c fames is the concentration of fames with the time mmol l 1 c tg0 is the initial concentration of triglycerides mmol l 1 limited by extraction equilibrium t the time and k is the apparent kinetic constant which can be obtained by applying the microsoft excel solver tool fig 4a shows the good fit of the proposed model at 80 c and 120 c r2 of 0 97 and 0 98 respectively whereas table s4 summarizes the values of the kinetic constant on the other hand as observed in fig 4a the model does not provide good data fitting at 40 c especially after the first hours of reaction time this fact suggests that the process is limited by lipid extraction at the lowest temperatures leading to lower biodiesel yields than the expected ones 3 10 effects of catalyst sludge ratio the sludge catalyst ratio is one of the most important reaction parameters which affect the reaction efficiency different sludge catalyst ratios were studied keeping constant the sludge loading as expected and shown in fig 5 higher catalyst loadings provide higher biodiesel yields and faster reaction rates 1 1 32 9 1 2 27 6 1 4 16 5 for 1 2 and 1 4 there is no big difference during the first 3 h although it can be seen that after this time the reaction rate is higher for 1 2 than for 1 4 which agrees with literature 11 18 as observed in the fig 5 the fames profile does not change at different catalyst sludge ratios since the amount and variety of extracted lipids does not depend on the catalyst loading this can also be corroborated from the biodiesel properties which remain unaltered in the experiments changing catalyst loadings table s3 since there are no significant variations the biodiesel quality obtained at the three different catalyst sludge ratios meets the standards so the 1 1 ratio is chosen as optimal since it results in a higher reaction rate and biodiesel yield 32 9 the summary of the properties obtained under optimal conditions can be seen in table 2 the maximum biodiesel yield obtained under optimal conditions can be compared with the obtained in other works with heterogeneous catalyst and sludge as raw material siddiquee et al studied biodiesel production using sba 15 impregnated with a heteropolyacid as heterogeneous catalysts and wastewater sludge as raw material the maximum biodiesel yield was 30 14 on the basis of lipid a little lower than that obtained in this work 17 the results can also be compared with those obtained by wu et al by using alkali catalyst for biodiesel production from sewage sludge in this case they obtained a yield of fame of 6 8 on the basis of dry sludge 41 in this work the biodiesel yield was 32 8 fames lipids taking into account that the percentage of lipids in the dry sludge is 20 54 the maximum biodiesel yield was 6 7 fames dry sludge the results obtained in this work are comparable with those obtained by wu et al adding the advantages of using heterogeneous acid catalyst already mentioned the proposed kinetic model was applied at different sludge catalyst ratio as shown in fig 5a the model fits with the experimental data in all cases with a correlation coefficient higher than 0 95 table s4 the amount of acid catalyst has a significant effect on the reaction rate table s4 mondala et al attributed this observation to the increase in the rate of formation of the reaction intermediates caused by the presence of a higher catalyst loading 42 3 11 catalyst reuse it is fully accepted that resins need to be regenerated after a period of use in order to recover their initial performance which entails an increase in operating costs that is why it is important to study the reuse of the resin in this study the catalyst was used directly after filtration for several reaction cycles the reusability reactions were carried out under optimal conditions a ir120 as catalyst catalyst sludge ratio 1 1 meoh sludge ratio 33 1 for 21 h at 120 c and us as pre treatment the amount of catalyst hardly varied in successive batch reactions since the catalyst losses during filtration were negligible as it can be observed in fig 6 the same resin has been employed for 8 reaction cycles the biodiesel yield remains constant for sixth cycles with a variation of 2 1 in the biodiesel yield values from 31 8 to 33 2 for the seventh and eighth run the performance loss is noticeable with a decrease of 16 6 and 29 7 respectively from the initial value fig 6a this behaviour on the decrease in the catalyst activity have been reported in previous studied and it has been associated to water blocking the active sites of the catalysts 11 43 regarding to the reaction profile it practically the same during the first 6 runs for the sixth and seventh runs a decrease in the reaction rate can be seen due to the decrease in the active centres available fig 6b even in the last two runs it seems that not all lipids reacted after the reaction time the catalyst reusability cannot be compared with other authors with sludge as raw material and heterogeneous catalyst since to the best of our knowledge there are no studies with several reaction cycles however the reuse of ion exchange resins to obtain biodiesel can be compared with studied that checked other raw materials zanette et al studied the catalyst reutilization in five successive batch experiments with amberlyst 15 as catalyst and jatropha curcas as raw material 13 they found a decrease in fame yield as the number of reuse increases from the first run on the other hand ilgen investigated the esterification of oleic acid with amberlyst 46 as catalyst and the conversion was almost kept constant for 10 runs 20 taking all this into account the experimental results obtained are promising and confirm the viability of amberlyst ir120 as heterogeneous catalyst for in situ transesterification with sewage sludge as raw material the catalyst not only offers good results but it can also be reuse for at least six runs without a decrease in the biodiesel yield 4 conclusions amberlyst ir120 is the catalyst with the highest biodiesel yield and the best biodiesel quality due to the catalyst acidity and swelling capacity mw and us as pre treatments improve the biodiesel yield however only the product obtained by us meet with the standards although sludge sieving 50 100 μm leads to an improvement in the lipid extraction there is a deterioration in the

13245,three different ion exchange resins amberlyst 15 36 and ir120 were used as heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification of the secondary sludge lipids catalyst performance was evaluated based on the biodiesel yield and quality the best biodiesel yield with the best properties was obtained with amberlyst ir120 microwaves mw and ultrasounds us were studied as a pre treatment step to increase lipid extraction us treatment shows the highest biodiesel yield providing a biodiesel that fulfils the current regulations the sludge particle size effect was also studied obtaining the best results using the smallest one however in these conditions ultrasound damage the lipids decreasing the biodiesel yield temperature and catalyst sludge ratio have been optimized the maximum biodiesel

under the optimal reaction conditions with negligible catalytic activity loss graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biodiesel sewage sludge heterogeneous catalysis ion exchange resins pre treatments 1 introduction despite its environmental and technological advantages biodiesel mainly fatty acids methyl esters fames is usually more expensive than petroleum based diesel especially when it is produced from vegetable oils or animal fats 1 in addition its current manufacture competes with the food industry since it is synthesized from edible oils and fats 2 therefore new raw materials are needed for reducing costs and avoid competition with food supply in this way several authors propose the use of waste cooking oil 3 4 or microalgae 5 9 as raw materials another potential feedstock is sewage sludge a by product of biological wastewater treatment plants the fatty acid content of the sludge is mainly in the range of c10 to c18 which can yield appropriate biodiesel qualities 10 wastewater treatment plants produce large quantities of sludge as a by product which make them a good feedstock for biodiesel production previous studies have demonstrated the potential of sewage sludge as feedstock by in situ transesterification with acid or basic homogeneous catalyst but both methods have several drawbacks in the case of basic catalysts when free fatty acids ffa are present soap formation can take place consuming the catalyst and reducing biodiesel yields 11 on the other hand homogeneous acid catalysts provide a lower reaction rate as well as important corrosion problems 12 to overcome the drawbacks of homogeneous catalysts heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed these catalysts improve the transesterification efficiency and enable catalyst separation and reutilization 13 although there are several studies about the use of heterogeneous catalysts very few propose sludge as raw material when the ffa content is higher than 1 an alkali catalyst is not recommended since the reaction is inhibited by the ffas leading to soap formation 14 15 for this reason recent advances are focused on heterogeneous acid catalysts since they provide several advantages such as high catalytic efficiency removal of biodiesel washing step ease of recovery and reuse and reducing corrosion of reactors 16 siddiquee et al and zhang et al checked different acid heterogeneous catalysts under a two step process extraction reaction siddiquee et al obtained a biodiesel yield of 30 14 based on lipids using sba 15 impregnated with a heteropolyacid pw12 as catalyst without studying the catalyst reuse 17 zhang and co workers prepared different so4 2 al2o3 sno2 catalysts reporting biodiesel yields close to 73 weight of biodiesel product weight of dried crude fat also without catalyst reuse 18 on the other hand melero et al studied the catalytic behaviour of the acid catalyst zr sba 15 obtaining a maximum fames yield of 15 5 fames dry sludge demonstrating the high potential of the catalyst 19 in this case they also studied the catalyst reusability in a second consecutive run with negligible decreases of the fames yields although the use of heterogeneous catalysts for sludge based processes is scarce solid acid catalysts were proposed for biodiesel production from common oils zeolites organic polymers acidic ion exchange resins heteropolyacids etc many of these studies are focussed on the esterification of fatty acids using ion exchange resins as catalysts since they present good properties in terms of esterification efficiency 11 20 22 acidity seems to be a determining factor in transesterification reactions therefore strong acidic ion exchange resins are an attractive alternative 1 with appropriate thermal and mechanical stability 11 on the other hand resins are more hydrophobic than other inorganic materials which is also considered as a key factor for these reactions 23 however to the best of our knowledge ion exchange resins have not been used before for sludge transesterification although catalyst selection is a key parameter to obtain a good esterification efficiency biodiesel yield also depends on the extraction process of the lipids present in the sludge the extraction is carried out with an organic solvent but it can be improved by different physical processes for promoting mass transfer from sludge particles to the liquid medium microwaves and ultrasounds among other pre treatments have been used to increase lipids extraction 24 25 although it has been shown that these pre treatments increase the lipid extraction yield there is no agreement about the best technique as it is highly dependent on the considered raw material on the other hand since the extraction depends on the contact between the sludge and the organic solvent milling and sieving of the raw material could increase the mass transfer thus increasing the extraction capacity for this reason a study about the particle size effect is also interesting in the present study three different ion exchange resins amberlyst 15 36 and ir120 with different physico chemical properties were selected as heterogeneous acid catalysts for biodiesel production from sewage sludge by in situ transesterification the screening was performed to select the catalyst providing the best results both in terms of yield and quality of the resulting biodiesel the effect of reaction conditions such as temperature catalyst loading as well as catalyst reusability for several reaction cycles were also studied analysing the results based on biodiesel yield and quality an additional investigation was done to determine the effect of pre treatments microwaves and ultrasound and the effect of sludge particle size on the performance and quality of the biodiesel 2 materials and methods samples of floating sludge correspond to the sewage treatment plant of la reguerona in gijón spain three different commercial resins were used as heterogeneous acid catalyst amberlyst 15 a 15 sigma aldrich amberlyst 36 a 36 sigma aldrich and amberlyst ir120 a ir120 merck chloroform 99 8 baker was used for determining the total lipid content in the sludge samples for the in situ transesterification process methanol meoh 99 8 vwr was employed as solvent sodium hydroxide 98 sigma aldrich and sodium chloride 99 sigma aldrich were used to titrate the catalyst acid sites a commercial mixture of 37 fames from c4 to c24 supplied by supelco was used for identification and quantification of the fatty acid methyl esters fames 2 1 sample preparation and characterization the total lipid content was determined according to the method proposed by siddiquee and rohani 26 this method uses chloroform 99 8 j t baker as solvent with a dry sludge solvent ratio of 1 g 25 ml at 75 c for 4 h under stirring after extraction the samples were filtered and residual particles were removed by centrifugation using a kubota 6500 centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 min the solvent of the supernatant was removed in a heidolph vv 2000 rotavapor at 70 c and the lipids were weighted in order to obtain the lipid content expresses as lipid g dry sludge g the swelling capacities were obtained according to the method proposed by özbay et al 1 the resins were dried in an oven at 105 c then a volume of each resin was placed into a measured tube and methanol was added the contact was kept at 50 60 c for 2 h and the initial and final volume of the resins were measured percentage of swelling can be calculated according to the following equation 1 swelling swollen volume initial volume 100 2 2 catalyst characterization the textural characterization of the resins was based on nitrogen adsorption tests and performed in a micromeritics asap 2020 surface analyser the catalysts acidity was measured by acid base titration following the method proposed by melero et al with naoh as ion exchange agent 27 2 3 experimental procedure the reactions were carried out by in situ transesterification in a 0 5 l stirred batch autoclave reactor with a pid temperature controller and a back pressure regulator autoclave engineers mawp 5500 psi three different ion exchange resins were checked as catalyst amberlyst 15 36 and ir120 for the study of the different catalysts the reactor was loaded with 0 3 l of methanol and meoh sludge ratio of 33 1 and sludge catalyst ratio of 2 1 following the optimum ratio proposed by carrero et al 2 the reactor was heated up to the desired temperature 120 c while stirring at 1000 rpm using a reaction time of 21 h long enough to ensure maximum lipid extraction has been achieved once the optimal catalyst has been selected different pre treatments were checked for maximizing extraction efficiency microwaves at 2450 mhz for 10 min and sonication at 10 khz during 50 min the sludges underwent these pre treatments before being introduced in the transesterification reactor 28 on the other hand since the sludge particle size can affect the extraction step three different fractions 50 100 μm 100 255 μm and 255 350 μm were tested in all cases experiments were performed at the same experimental conditions that the catalyst selection experiments to optimize the experimental conditions different temperatures were studied from 40 c to 120 c whereas different catalyst sludge ratios was also tested 1 1 1 2 and 1 4 2 4 fames analysis product distribution was evaluated by gas chromatography the qualitative analysis of fames was analysed using a shimadzu gc ms qp2010 plus with a trb 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm column 1 μl of the sample was injected with a split ratio of 30 injection port temperature was kept at 260 c ms source at 200 c and interface temperature 250 c column temperature was operated to start at 100 c kept for 5 min then raised from 100 c to 240 c with a rate of 4 c min and held at this temperature for 30 min the quantitative analysis was carried out using a shimadzu gc2010 with a fid detector and a cp sil 8cb 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm column the detector temperature was 260 c and the temperature program was the same than for the qualitative analysis fames yield φfame was calculated according to the eq 2 expressed as g fame g lipid 2 φ fame c i fame v t tl 100 where ci fame is the concentration of all detected fames vt the total volume and tl the total lipid content 2 5 biodiesel properties the main physicochemical properties of biodiesel produced were obtained since these properties are closely related to the composition profile of the obtained fames all the physicochemical properties long chain saturated factor lcsf saponification value sv degree of unsaturation du cold filter plugging point cfpp iodine number in kinematic viscosity density higher heating value hhv and cetane number cn were estimated according to the equations shown in different articles 4 29 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst selection the reaction profile for the different catalysts is shown in fig 1a the activity of the studied catalysts expressed as fames lipids yield decreases in the order a ir120 21 23 a 36 20 20 a 15 14 98 results obtained for a ir120 and a 36 are very similar reaching the maximum biodiesel yield after 16 h reaction time in the case of a 15 the slope obtained during the first 16 h is much lower but the yield also stabilizes after this reaction time taking into account the catalysts properties table 1 surface acidity and pore diameter are the key parameters governing catalyst performance among these two properties acidity has the most evident effect since in the case of a 36 and a ir120 although a 36 presents the highest particle diameter the final yield obtained is lower than for a ir120 the catalyst with the highest acidity when the fames yield is normalized per acid sites an opposite trend than the described in fig 1a is obtained a ir120 8 23 a 36 9 27 a 15 14 41 this fact indicates that even though a ir120 has a higher acidity value not all active sites are used in the selective fames production obtained results suggest that diffusional effects on the resins play a key role in the catalyst performance which is consistent with the large molecular size of the triglycerides involved in the reaction thus the low porosity material that also has the acid sites in the external surface present the best performance whereas in the case of mesoporous materials a large fraction of the acid sites is not fully accessible to the reactants on the other hand previous studies have demonstrated that resins with lower crosslinking have higher swelling capacity which affects positively in the esterification rate 1 the swelling capacity follows the order a ir120 37 a 36 22 a 15 10 which matches with the trends observed for the biodiesel yields thus high acidity and swelling capacity play a more determinant role than the other morphological parameters this fact is congruent with the low esterification rate obtained with a 15 with higher surface area and mesoporous volume but lower acidity and swelling capacity besides park et al found that the water produced during the esterification reaction acts as inhibitor form the acid sites of the resin a 15 22 they also compared a 15 with a bd20 a resin with similar sbet and vmeso than a 36 for which they obtained better results since the interaction of the acid sites with the released water is weaker keeping constant its activity 22 3 2 biodiesel quality the feasibility of a process based on wastewater sludge for obtaining biodiesel will depend not only on the fame yield but also on the quality of the resulting biodiesel obviously this quality will mainly depend on the raw sludge but catalyst can also play a role in these properties the fames profile obtained for each catalyst is shown in fig 1b in all cases the percentage of saturated fames is similar and close to 90 although the ratio between saturated and unsaturated fames can influence the biodiesel quality the optimal ratio has not been stablished yet 33 saturated fames offer better burning properties meanwhile unsaturated ones are associated with better fluidity under cold temperature 34 the fames profile is similar for a 15 and a ir120 for which the biodiesel obtained is predominantly composed of methyl esters of palmitic acid c16 0 and stearic acid c18 0 in the case of a 36 the proportion of palmitic acid decreases increasing the amount of the methyl ester of c15 0 this unexpected effect suggests a specific interaction of the triglycerides with the catalyst probably because of the abovementioned diffusional effects these effects are negligible in the a ir120 catalyst but not for the others this differentiation could be attributed to the difficulty of the compounds to access the active centers as the catalysts have different pore diameter table 1 from the fames profile the biofuel properties can be determined to study the viability of the biofuel obtained according to the standard specification for biodiesel fuel by astm d975 and en 590 table s1 the biodiesel obtained with the three different catalysts are quite similar the main differences are related to the iodine number in kinematic viscosity ηi and higher heating value hhv although astm d975 and en 590 provide no specifications for in en14111 specified a maximum value of 120 the values obtained in this study follow the order a 36 8 12 a 15 9 71 a ir120 10 41 and all of them are far from the maximum recommended in the case of the kinematic viscosity one important parameter that define the capability of fuel only the biofuel obtained with a ir120 as catalyst meets the requirements of the standard specifications with a value of 2 03 mm2 s although there is no standard requirement in the case of hhv the typical value for a diesel is close to 49 mj kg and it was found to be between 39 and 43 for biodiesel from different raw materials 35 in this case for a ir120 the value is close to that obtained for mineral diesel whereas a 15 provides a fuel more similar to conventional biodiesel in the case of a 36 the value obtained is higher than that obtained for mineral diesel in relation with the other parameters with standard specifications saponification value sv density and cetane number cn in all cases the values obtained comply with the standards without significant differences among the three catalysts as for the other properties there is not regulation fixed values for degree of saturation du since it is not a final property of biofuels long chain saturated factor lcsf is in the same situation regarding the cold filter plugging point cfpp in these cases the value is close to 58 c the cfpp for diesel fuel is between 0 and 12 c but in the case of biodiesel it is usually higher and depends on the raw material so it will be necessary additives to decrease cfpp 36 to sum up a ir120 achieved not only the maximum biodiesel yield but also the best biodiesel quality being the only catalyst that complies with all the values set by the regulations for these reasons it is the catalyst selected to carry out the optimization of the transesterification process 3 3 effect of different pre treatments on the biodiesel yield the biodiesel yield not only depends on the transesterification process but also on the extraction process in the samples obtained by the in situ transesterification with a ir120 as catalyst no lipids were detected in the final samples which suggests that all the extracted lipids have been trans esterified therefore the option of a pre treatment to favour the lipids extraction is a good alternative to increase the biodiesel yield thus pre treatments of the sludge with microwaves mw and ultrasounds us were tested for improving the extractability of the sludge as they have been shown to maximize the lipid extraction from biological samples 24 as observed in fig 2a both methods have resulted in improved lipid extraction since the maximum biodiesel yield increases with mw and us these results show that the use of these techniques favour the cellular breakdown and as a consequence larger amounts of lipids were extracted this increase leads to a significant increase in biodiesel yield the increase in the maximum yield obtained was 12 and 3 for mw yield 23 8 and us yield 27 6 respectively in both cases no lipids were detected in the final samples which suggests that all the lipids extracted have been trans esterified which confirms that extraction is a limiting step on the other hand the yield profile fig 2a is quite similar for both pre treatments mw and us during the first hours and the in situ transesterification is faster when these pre treatments are applied since more lipids are available for the transesterification process the maximum biodiesel yield is obtained after 14 h in both cases faster than without pre treatments at this point is also important to mention that no ffas were detected in the final samples which confirms that all the extracted ffas have reacted regarding to the best technique there is no unanimity in the bibliography about which pre treatment achieves a greater improvement being dependent on the raw material and the experimental conditions martinez guerra et al studied the effect of these pre treatments for the extractive transesterification of algal lipids chlorella sp obtaining the highest yield and conversion for mw although both methods produce better results than the conventional one 25 but nevertheless prabakaran and co workers obtained higher lipid content by using the sonication method when compared with mw using chlorella sp and nostoc sp as raw material 37 in this work mw and us are applied on sludge sample after a storage period in waste treatment facility thus these sludges will be more compacted than fresh sludges us pre treatment leads to sludge floccules fragmentation that enhances lipid extraction hence the best performance with us this effect is not so marked with the mw pre treatment 3 4 effect of pre treatments on the biodiesel quality although the best biodiesel yield was obtained with us it is important to check the biodiesel quality in all cases since the different pre treatments could modify the lipidic fraction and consequently the biodiesel quality as observed in fig 2b the fames profile changes when mw and us are used the fraction of palmitic acid methyl esters c16 0 increases with both pre treatments being more marked for the case of mw on the contrary the amount of c15 0 decrease drastically on the other hand with us the percentage of c18 0 increase in a small percentage meanwhile it decreases a bit for mw the fraction of saturated fames decreases from 88 no pre treatment to 85 8 and 85 7 for mw and us respectively the monounsaturated one s increase from 10 9 no pre treatment to 12 4 mw and 12 6 us the greatest difference is obtained in the case of polyunsaturated fames for which the percentage increases from 0 6 no pre treatment to close to 1 2 for mw and us however although polyunsaturated fames can lead to undesired gums formation reactions which decrease the product stability a 1 2 is considered a small percentage that would not cause problems in the interval of plant biodiesel regarding to the fuel properties regulated by the astm d975 and en590 standards table s1 there is a change when using mw as a pre treatment decreasing the kinematic viscosity below the set limits with a value of 1 94 mm2 s table s2 it is not a value very far from the standards but in the case of us it fulfils all the regulation standards this difference in terms of the fuel properties is due to the different effects of both treatments in the lipid extraction in general terms all the properties improve when the studied pre treatments are applied with the exception of the saponification value sv but they are very close to the initial ones 3 5 effect of sludge particle size on the biodiesel yield since it has been demonstrated that extraction is a limit stage it is interesting to carry out the in situ transesterification at different sludge particle sizes as a smaller particle size could favour the extraction process by increasing the contact surface as can be seen in fig 3a the biodiesel yield follows the order 50 100 μm 24 3 no sieving 21 23 100 250 μm 18 6 250 355 μm 15 2 only the particle size of 50 100 μm the smallest one get an improvement in the final yield with an increase in 14 1 even higher than the obtained with mw 23 8 the lipid content of each fraction was analysed without relevant variations in the results therefore the difference in yield cannot be due to a difference in the lipid content but an improvement in the lipid extraction this difference in performance is attributed to the fact that a smaller particle size results in a better sludge solvent contact which lead to greater lipid extraction and higher biodiesel yield since the non pre treated sludge is a mixture of all particle sizes there is not a net improvement of the extraction efficiency comparing the yield of each individual fraction and the whole sludge regarding the yield profile it is quite similar during the first 8 h and the maximum lipid extraction capacity and therefore maximum biodiesel yield was reached after 14 h for 250 355 μm and after 17 h in the case of 50 100 and 100 250 since the biodiesel yield remains constant after 17 h in all cases and no free lipids were detected in the final samples the different lipid availability in each fraction is the main responsible of the observed yield differences since us has resulted in a higher performance they were applied to the different particle sizes to check if this could further increase the maximum yield obtained giving a synergistic effect of both pre treatments sieving and us as observed in fig 3b a decrease in yield between 5 and 10 is observed compared to sieving without ultrasound being larger to smaller particle sizes these results suggest that the us can damage lipid content the smaller the particle size the greater the damage which has already been reported in previous works 38 39 when ultrasound without sieving was used the biodiesel yield was higher since the raw material contains mostly particles greater than 355 μm in fact the raw sludge is composed mainly of larger particles being the small range 50 100 μm the least representative regarding the yield profile as when sieving was checking without us it is quite similar during the first 8 h the difference after this time is due to the different amount of lipids available due to the extraction process which leads to a different final yield in the case of 100 250 and 250 355 μm a constant profile was obtaining after 14 h meanwhile for 50 100 μm it seems that more time is necessary to reach the maximum biodiesel yield 3 6 effect of sludge particle size on the biodiesel quality comparing the fames profile obtained at different particles sizes the c16 0 fraction decreases by increasing the particle size whereas c18 0 increase at increasing particle sizes fig 3c this is due to the different composition depending on the particle size of the sludge since only a differentiation by size has been carried out without modifying the starting raw material or subjecting it to any other treatment the fraction of saturated compounds remains almost constant around 88 but there are small differences in the unsaturated moieties as particle size decreases the resulting biodiesel shows a slightly higher fraction of polyunsaturated and vice versa which implies the opposite effect in the monounsaturated fame yields about the biodiesel properties table s2 these properties hardly differ from the result obtained without sieving except the kinematic viscosity this last parameter is in all cases lower than regulated standards for this reason although smaller sieving results in an increase in the biodiesel yield it is not a good alternative since the kinematic viscosity is found below the standards when sieving and us were combined fig 3d there are no major differences in the fames profile except in the amount of c18 o which increase when us is applied to the particle size 100 250 μm besides taking into account the properties of the final biodiesel shown in table s2 it does not imply an improvement in the fuel quality regarding to the regulated properties the kinematic viscosity remains below the minimum value set by the standards as in the case of the abovementioned treatments 3 7 effects of reaction temperature in situ esterification reactions were carried out at three different temperatures 40 80 and 120 c below to the upper temperature limit of the catalyst operation the catalyst selected was a ir120 with catalyst sludge ratio 1 2 meoh sludge ratio 33 1 for 21 h and us as pre treatment since it was proven to be the best alternative for an increase in the process performance as observed in fig 4 as the temperature increases the biodiesel yield also increases following the order 120 c 27 6 80 c 22 5 40 c 14 5 40 this fact is a good agreement with an endothermic equilibrium limited overall process besides the slope before to reach the maximum biodiesel yield also increase with the temperature so the reaction rate increases with temperature similar trend has been reported by other authors 11 20 21 in the final samples no lipids were detected in any case suggesting that the amount of extracted lipids increases as temperature increases therefore the slope in the biodiesel profile formation rate increases because there are more lipids available for the transesterification reaction therefore temperature plays a key role in the lipids extraction which determines the maximum biodiesel yield in the case of 40 c the maximum biodiesel yield was reached after 8 h reaction time meanwhile for 80 c and 120 c it was achieved after 11 h maximum lipid extraction was reached in all the cases since the biodiesel yield remains constant with the time in the same way negligible lipid presence was detected in the final samples suggesting that lipid extraction efficiency and therefore biodiesel yield increase as temperature increases 3 8 effect of temperature on biodiesel quality as in the previous sections it is also important to study the effect of the reaction temperature on the biodiesel quality fig 4b shows the fames profile at different temperatures in the case of 80 c and 120 c the fames profile is quiet similar with small variations in the amount of c16 0 and c18 0 but it changes drastically for 40 c not only the fames profile changes but also the fames variety at 120 c 17 different fames were obtained 15 at 80 c and only 4 at 40 c c15 0 c16 0 c18 1 and c18 0 which will affect the biodiesel properties when the temperature is lowered to 80 c the profile of saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fames is rather similar on the contrary at 40 c polyunsaturated fames are not obtained and the percentage of monounsaturated decreases from close to 12 at 120 c and 80 c respectively to 1 07 the different biodiesel properties as a function of temperature are shown in table s3 due to the drastic variation in the fames profile and the large decrease in unsaturated ones at 40 c some biodiesel properties are extremely modified such as du in kinematic viscosity and hhv of these properties the only one with a value set by the regulations is the kinematic viscosity which decrease by half far from the minimum set by the standards at 80 c although there is no great variation in the biodiesel properties the highest differences are in the hhv and kinematic viscosity where the latter no longer meets with the regulation thus considering both the biodiesel yield and quality the higher temperature offers the best results 3 9 kinetic modelling a kinetic model is proposed for gaining further understanding about the reaction mechanism and as a starting point for designing purposes the overall transesterification reaction is given by 3 tg 3 meoh 3 fame glycerine due to the large methanol excess its concentration was considered constant and the reaction was considered as irreversible a first order reaction is proposed and the concentration of fames can be obtained according to the eq 4 4 c fames 3 c tgo 1 e k t where c fames is the concentration of fames with the time mmol l 1 c tg0 is the initial concentration of triglycerides mmol l 1 limited by extraction equilibrium t the time and k is the apparent kinetic constant which can be obtained by applying the microsoft excel solver tool fig 4a shows the good fit of the proposed model at 80 c and 120 c r2 of 0 97 and 0 98 respectively whereas table s4 summarizes the values of the kinetic constant on the other hand as observed in fig 4a the model does not provide good data fitting at 40 c especially after the first hours of reaction time this fact suggests that the process is limited by lipid extraction at the lowest temperatures leading to lower biodiesel yields than the expected ones 3 10 effects of catalyst sludge ratio the sludge catalyst ratio is one of the most important reaction parameters which affect the reaction efficiency different sludge catalyst ratios were studied keeping constant the sludge loading as expected and shown in fig 5 higher catalyst loadings provide higher biodiesel yields and faster reaction rates 1 1 32 9 1 2 27 6 1 4 16 5 for 1 2 and 1 4 there is no big difference during the first 3 h although it can be seen that after this time the reaction rate is higher for 1 2 than for 1 4 which agrees with literature 11 18 as observed in the fig 5 the fames profile does not change at different catalyst sludge ratios since the amount and variety of extracted lipids does not depend on the catalyst loading this can also be corroborated from the biodiesel properties which remain unaltered in the experiments changing catalyst loadings table s3 since there are no significant variations the biodiesel quality obtained at the three different catalyst sludge ratios meets the standards so the 1 1 ratio is chosen as optimal since it results in a higher reaction rate and biodiesel yield 32 9 the summary of the properties obtained under optimal conditions can be seen in table 2 the maximum biodiesel yield obtained under optimal conditions can be compared with the obtained in other works with heterogeneous catalyst and sludge as raw material siddiquee et al studied biodiesel production using sba 15 impregnated with a heteropolyacid as heterogeneous catalysts and wastewater sludge as raw material the maximum biodiesel yield was 30 14 on the basis of lipid a little lower than that obtained in this work 17 the results can also be compared with those obtained by wu et al by using alkali catalyst for biodiesel production from sewage sludge in this case they obtained a yield of fame of 6 8 on the basis of dry sludge 41 in this work the biodiesel yield was 32 8 fames lipids taking into account that the percentage of lipids in the dry sludge is 20 54 the maximum biodiesel yield was 6 7 fames dry sludge the results obtained in this work are comparable with those obtained by wu et al adding the advantages of using heterogeneous acid catalyst already mentioned the proposed kinetic model was applied at different sludge catalyst ratio as shown in fig 5a the model fits with the experimental data in all cases with a correlation coefficient higher than 0 95 table s4 the amount of acid catalyst has a significant effect on the reaction rate table s4 mondala et al attributed this observation to the increase in the rate of formation of the reaction intermediates caused by the presence of a higher catalyst loading 42 3 11 catalyst reuse it is fully accepted that resins need to be regenerated after a period of use in order to recover their initial performance which entails an increase in operating costs that is why it is important to study the reuse of the resin in this study the catalyst was used directly after filtration for several reaction cycles the reusability reactions were carried out under optimal conditions a ir120 as catalyst catalyst sludge ratio 1 1 meoh sludge ratio 33 1 for 21 h at 120 c and us as pre treatment the amount of catalyst hardly varied in successive batch reactions since the catalyst losses during filtration were negligible as it can be observed in fig 6 the same resin has been employed for 8 reaction cycles the biodiesel yield remains constant for sixth cycles with a variation of 2 1 in the biodiesel yield values from 31 8 to 33 2 for the seventh and eighth run the performance loss is noticeable with a decrease of 16 6 and 29 7 respectively from the initial value fig 6a this behaviour on the decrease in the catalyst activity have been reported in previous studied and it has been associated to water blocking the active sites of the catalysts 11 43 regarding to the reaction profile it practically the same during the first 6 runs for the sixth and seventh runs a decrease in the reaction rate can be seen due to the decrease in the active centres available fig 6b even in the last two runs it seems that not all lipids reacted after the reaction time the catalyst reusability cannot be compared with other authors with sludge as raw material and heterogeneous catalyst since to the best of our knowledge there are no studies with several reaction cycles however the reuse of ion exchange resins to obtain biodiesel can be compared with studied that checked other raw materials zanette et al studied the catalyst reutilization in five successive batch experiments with amberlyst 15 as catalyst and jatropha curcas as raw material 13 they found a decrease in fame yield as the number of reuse increases from the first run on the other hand ilgen investigated the esterification of oleic acid with amberlyst 46 as catalyst and the conversion was almost kept constant for 10 runs 20 taking all this into account the experimental results obtained are promising and confirm the viability of amberlyst ir120 as heterogeneous catalyst for in situ transesterification with sewage sludge as raw material the catalyst not only offers good results but it can also be reuse for at least six runs without a decrease in the biodiesel yield 4 conclusions amberlyst ir120 is the catalyst with the highest biodiesel yield and the best biodiesel quality due to the catalyst acidity and swelling capacity mw and us as pre treatments improve the biodiesel yield however only the product obtained by us meet with the standards although sludge sieving 50 100 μm leads to an improvement in the lipid extraction there is a deterioration in the biodiesel quality besides us can damage lipid structure which results in lower quality fuels the maximum biodiesel yield obtained was 32 9 at the optimal conditions after reuse the activity of a ir120

13246,increasing the efficiency of aerobic greywater treatment is crucial to ensure that greywater recycling can be effectively implemented in individual and community households in this work we demonstrate that exposing greywater samples to low intensity high frequency mhz order surface acoustic waves saws during the aerobic treatment process can result in increases in the total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod removal efficiencies by 24 24 and 21 respectively over a 2 h aerobic digestion period and up to 37 tss removal efficiency over a 4 h period compared to the unexposed controls these values are considerably higher than that typically obtained with lower frequency khz order bulk ultrasound particularly because the saw does not cause denaturation of bacteria in the greywater suspension unlike its low frequency counterpart the saw enhancement in removal efficiencies can primarily be attributed to the acoustic radiation pressure and acoustic streaming that it generates which act to efficiently deagglomerate the bacterial flocculates in addition to promoting more uniform mixing of the suspended waste bacteria and dissolved oxygen in the sample also the results indicate that in the presence of air bubbles in the greywater the mhz order saw treatment remains effective additionally we show that it is possible to further increase the tss removal efficiency by about twofold through a hybrid process this ability to significantly accelerate the rate of aerobic digestion to achieve a given removal efficiency level highlights the potential of this novel low cost technology for improving domestic greywater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment surface acoustic wave aerobic process greywater ultrasound 1 introduction the rapid pace of modernization and industrialization in the last century has resulted in significant increases in water pollution that in turn has led to unprecedented levels of water scarcity in many nations across the globe 1 by 2025 it is estimated that up to half of the global population will be short of freshwater supply 2 there is therefore a pressing need to develop more effective wastewater treatment platforms and in particular systems that efficiently recycle water for reuse methods for treating wastewater can be classified into physical chemical biological treatments or a combination of these methods physical treatments typically utilize membranes to filter dissolved and suspended solids 3 6 whereas chemical treatments involve for example photodegradation for the removal of contaminants in the wastewater 7 known as greywater the wastewater recycled from domestic or commercial buildings constitutes an alternative water resource for many applications due to its low pollutant concentration and potentially large volumes 8 with proper treatment greywater can be recycled for many applications such as toilet flushing irrigation and other cleaning purposes 9 given that greywater is obtained from household or commercial wastewater streams that do no contain fecal contamination biological treatment can often be employed to effectively remove microorganisms organic compounds and particulates present in the stream such treatment can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic methods the choice of which depends on scale and cost 10 as aerobic digestion is normally operated in smaller communities and has several advantages including low initial and operating costs high stabilization rates and operation simplicity in addition to constituting an odor free process 11 it is the preferred treatment for household greywater recycling in aerobic digestion organic matter is degraded using bacteria in the presence of oxygen more specifically when aerobic microorganisms are placed in a culture containing organic matter and oxygen they utilize the oxygen to decompose the organics and convert them into other materials 12 this process is utilized in many greywater treatment technologies such as sequencing batch reactors 13 14 and membrane bioreactors 15 16 although these systems are effective in treating greywater a limitation of the process is the long duration up to days or weeks required to achieve high removal efficiencies as such there is a need for techniques to increase microbial activity in sludge to enhance greywater treatment many studies have reported the benefits of using ultrasound technology to improve sludge treatment in these systems cyclic pressure sound waves at frequencies between 20 khz and 3 mhz generated using piezoelectric transducers drives cavitation of the liquid i e the formation of low pressure voids in the liquid which draw vapor from the surrounding liquid into it as they grow and oscillate resulting in the formation of cavitation bubbles 17 these cavitation bubbles themselves grow and collapse emitting shock waves that significantly increase the localized temperature and pressure above 104 k and 1 gpa 18 which then trigger other phenomena such as microstreaming and free radical formation all of which have been shown to promote sludge disintegration for example free radicals are known to play a role in the degradation of non volatile pollutants 19 whereas the large mechanical stresses associated with cavitation are capable of breaking down sludge flocculates the elevated temperatures during cavitation however have the tendency disrupt bacterial cell membranes 20 depending on the applied frequency power input and sonication duration 17 ultrasound has also been reported to promote cell growth 15 and poliferation 21 increase enzymatic activity 22 23 or increase cell membrane permeability to effect greater mass transfer 22 by employing low power 45 w ℓ 25 khz ultrasound for just 20 mins every 3 days over 17 days ding et al 24 showed that it was possible to enhance the aerobic digestion process by improving the removal efficiency r e of the total suspended solids by 6 from r e 30 to r e 36 this was attributed to the additional mechanical stresses imposed by the ultrasonic excitation which led to the breaking down of the sludge flocculates to result in 1 an enhancement in the total surface area to volume ratio 2 the generation of bulk convective liquid recirculation acoustic streaming which leads to an enhancement in the nutrient and waste mass transfer and 3 an enhancement in enzymatic activity of the sludge due to better selectivity between the enzyme and substrate all of which result in more efficient digestion high power 2400 w ℓ 20 khz ultrasound over pre treatment durations of 30 mins for 15 days has also been demonstrated to enhance aerobic bacteria treatment increasing the total suspended solids removal efficiency by 13 from r e 25 to r e 38 25 the improvement being attributed to the increase in biodegradability and decomposition efficiency of the sludge digestion due to the breakdown of sludge flocculates despite these benefits in enhancing aerobic digestion the use of ultrasound is severely limited by the necessity for long irradiation durations a significant reduction in treatment efficacy can result if the ultrasound intensity is not carefully controlled during this time 23 24 26 due to sludge disintegration in addition to excessive cell lysis and apoptosis that decreases microbial activity 27 to circumvent this we examine the use of high frequency mhz order surface acoustic waves saws in place of the low frequency khz order ultrasound excitation besides the difference in their frequencies saws which are nanometer order amplitude electromechanical waves are confined to the surface of a piezoelectric substrate as opposed to the bulk nature of their ultrasonic counterparts and have been shown to be a markedly more efficient mechanism for coupling energy from a solid into a liquid with much lower losses 28 29 and as such have been employed for a myriad of microfluidic applications 28 31 including particle trapping sorting and manipulation 32 35 sessile and microchannel droplet translation 36 44 micropumping 45 50 micromixing and microcentrifugation 51 59 jetting 60 62 filtration 63 64 and nebulization 65 71 more importantly the lower powers and higher frequencies associated with the saw are insufficient to drive cavitation 72 and hence does not lead to the denaturation of biomolecules and cells consequently saws have been demonstrated as an efficient tool for cell stimulation to effect a number of biological and cellular processes 73 74 such as enhancing cell proliferation 75 76 seed germination 77 intracellular transport 78 80 piezochannel activation 81 exosome production 82 and acoustotaxis 83 whilst maintaining high cell viability and in the case of stem cells their ability to differentiate 84 in this work we demonstrate the effectiveness of applying these mhz order saws to enhance aerobic greywater treatment given that the aeration process can affect acoustic wave propagation in the greywater sample and hence the effectiveness of the technique the setup is configured to excite the saw devices at higher powers to effect considerably higher difference in removal efficiencies up to r e 24 thus demonstrating the effectiveness of this chipscale high frequency acoustomicrofluidic system for the treatment of aerobic bacterial sludge various operating conditions such as the airflow rate excitation power and treatment duration among others are investigated for different greywater samples moreover we also demonstrate that the removal efficiency can be increased even further by approximately twofold through a hybrid process involving the combination of pre treatment of the bacterial sludge with khz order ultrasound with the mhz order saw greywater treatment 2 experimental method and numerical simulation 2 1 saw devices the saw devices comprised 128 rotated y cut x propagating single crystal lithium niobate linbo3 piezoelectric substrates roditi ltd london uk photolithographically patterned with focusing elliptical single phase unidirectional transducers fe spudts as shown in the inset in fig 1 a a thin layer of hydrophobic coating teflon af dupont corp wilmington de usa was deposited over the transducers to prevent any possible damage when air bubbles generated at the air liquid interface come into contact with the transducers to generate the saw a sinusoidal electric signal from a function generator afg1062 tektronix inc beaverton or usa and high frequency amplifier zhl 5 w 1 mini circuits inc ny usa was applied to the fe spudt at a frequency that corresponds to the resonant frequency of the transducer f saw 30 5 mhz which is determined by the finger spacing and width to increase the efficiency of the system an amplitude modulation scheme similar to that previously reported 56 63 was employed the total input electric power of the modulated signal

at f m 1 khz 2 2 greywater and bacterial sludge mixed culture bacteria were obtained from the wastewater treatment system of a local palm oil processing plant sime darby east oil mill carey island selangor malaysia the culture was adapted to aerobic conditions and greywater prior to their use for this study through intermittent feeding of greywater and continuous aeration in the mixed culture tank prior to their extraction from the tank the entire suspension in the tank was stirred and the bacteria left to sediment on the bottom of the tank for approximately 1 h the extracted bacteria was then transferred to a beaker filled with greywater produced by the washing of hands with three different commercial facial exfoliating scrubs under a running tap sample a face clay mask scrub freeman beauty beverly hills ca usa sample b garnier pureactive anti acne white l oreal jakarta indonesia sample c simple unilever london uk the amount of face scrub the duration of washing and the amount of tap water used were carefully controlled to ensure consistency in each greywater sample for each experiment 3 mℓ of mixed culture aerobic bacteria and 12 mℓ of greywater were extracted using a syringe and mixed in a 25 mℓ beaker ϕ b 32 mm in diameter and h b 50 mm in height at a ratio of 1 4 i e one part mixed culture bacteria to 4 parts greywater the sidewalls of the beaker were fitted with four saw devices arranged orthogonally to each other as partially illustrated in fig 1 a conservatively assuming that all of the saw input electrical power i e 0 30 w p e 0 90 w is transmitted into the greywater we estimate acoustic densities in the range 20 60 w ℓ which is similar to that used in low power khz order ultrasound work reported in the literature 24 to supply air into the greywater bacterial suspension for aerobic digestion a stainless steel syringe needle of diameter ϕ n 600 μm 91 020 hamilton franklin ma usa connected to a variable air flow meter model 2510 brooks instrument hatfield pa usa and a portable mini air pump 1 w via rubber hosing was submerged in the middle of the beaker to a distance approximately h n 5 mm away between the needle tip and the bottom of the beaker see fig 1 a upon activation of the air pump air bubbles were generated at the tip of the needle with a volume flow rate q ab five different air flow rates were used q ab 0 10 ℓ min 0 15 ℓ min 0 20 ℓ min 0 25 ℓ min and 0 30 ℓ min due to their buoyancy the air bubbles moved rapidly upward to the air liquid interface at the same time driving flow within the greywater suspension the maximum velocity of the induced streaming flow v max generated either by the bubbling alone or in combination with the acoustic streaming generated by the saw was estimated by monitoring the trajectories of the bubbles at 10 frames s using a video camera am7915mzt dino lite anmo electronics taiwan with the aid of particle tracking software diatrack v3 03 semasopht north epping nsw australia 86 concurrently we also estimated the diameter of these air bubbles from the acquired images under different conditions the amount of oxygen dissolved in the greywater can change this was quantified using a dissolved oxygen meter ysi 5000 ysi inc yellow springs oh usa before and after the treatment for both samples with and without the saw the dissolved oxygen rate was estimated from dor do f do i 60 duration in mins where dof is the dissolved oxygen following treatment mg ℓ and doi is that prior to the treatment mg ℓ while the samples were exposed to the saw irradiation under a continuous supply of air over a duration of 2 h control experiments in the absence of the saw irradiation were conducted in parallel under the same aeration conditions over the same 2 h duration the density viscosity and temperature of the greywater suspension was measured at 1 h intervals during the treatment process using a force tensiometer attension sigma 702 biolin scientific gothenburg sweden viscometer sv 10 sine wave vibro viscometer a d co ltd tokyo japan and thermocouple connected to a data logger gl820 graphtec corp irvine ca usa additionally we also examined the uniformity of the bacteria flocculates or clusters in the greywater suspension for each experiment 100 μℓ was extracted from the top half of the beaker before and after the 2 h treatment process and placed atop a microscope slide the samples were then left at room temperature to dry in air and subsequently examined under brightfield microscopy bx41m olympus tokyo japan and field emission scanning electron microscopy su8010 hitachi gmbh krefeld germany given that the excitation of saws can result in a slight increase in the temperature of greywater suspensions we also conducted additional controlled experiments to examine the effect of temperature alone in the absence of the saw in these experiments the beaker containing the greywater suspension was placed on a hot plate c mag hs7 ika werke gmbh co kg cologne germany and the temperature of the suspension increased to a value similar to that measured when it is in the presence of the saw excitation 2 3 removal efficiency to quantify the removal efficiency small sample volumes were extracted from the greywater bacterial suspensions before and after the 2 h treatment specifically the suspensions were stirred for approximately 3 s and left for 10 mins for the bacteria to sediment this results in the suspension partitioning into two regions a region that comprises predominantly greywater at the top half of the beaker and a region predominantly containing mixed culture aerobic bacteria at the bottom half of the beaker 120 μℓ volume samples were then extracted from the top region with a micropipette and placed in a 1 5 mℓ microcentrifuge tube for subsequent analysis of its content for all of the extracted samples total suspended solids tss measurements were conducted in accordance with the american public health association apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 87 briefly a blank sample cell was filled with 10 mℓ of di water cleaned externally using a delicate task wipe kimtech kimberly clark worldwide inc irving tx usa and placed into the cell holder of a portable spectrophotometer dr2800 hach loveland co usa to calibrate the system at 0 mg ℓ tss the experimental sample on the other hand was prepared by diluting the extracted solution in di water by 100 from which 10 mℓ was extracted into another sample cell and placed into the cell holder of the portable spectrophotometer to measure its tss value measurements were conducted both before and after treatment and the tss removal efficiencies calculated from r e ts s i ts s f ts s i 100 in which tss i and tss f are the initial and final total suspended solid concentrations of the sample respectively the tss removal efficiencies were then estimated for the conditions of varying saw excitation power p e and flow rate of compressed air pumped into the greywater suspensions q ab in addition the effectiveness of this technique by varying the initial concentration was also investigated besides the tss removal efficiency we also quantified the removal efficiency based on chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod as specified by the apha standards 87 the cod is a measure of the amount of dissolved oxygen required for the chemical oxidation of total organic matter present in the greywater sample whereas the bod is a measure of the dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms to decompose the organic matter present in the greywater sample at a specific temperature and over a specific period for the cod test the digital reactor block drb200 hach loveland co usa was first switched on and preheated to 150 c next 100 μℓ of the sample was extracted and diluted 40 with di water the solution was stirred evenly from which a 2 mℓ sample was extracted and added into the cod vial for the selected low range 3 150 mg ℓ in the meantime 2 mℓ of di water was added into another cod vial to be used as the blank the vials were closed tightly and inverted gently several times to mix the samples thoroughly they were then placed in the preheated drb200 reactor and heated for 2 h after which the reactor was switched off and the vials left to cool in the reactor for approximately 20 mins to below 120 c the vials were then inverted again several times whilst still warm and subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature for the cod measurements both vials were cleaned externally with delicate task wipers kimtech kimberly clark worldwide inc irving tx usa prior to the measurements the blank was first inserted into the cell holder of the portable spectrophotometer to calibrate the reading to 0 mg ℓ following which the sample vial was inserted into the cell holder to measure its cod removal efficiency which can be calculated from r e co d i co d f cod 100 where codi and codf are the initial and final cod values of the samples respectively for the bod test clean jugs were first filled with clean distilled water and shaken to saturate the water with air bod nutrient buffer pillow hach loveland co usa was then shaken thoroughly before being added into the distilled water the jugs were capped and shaken vigorously for 1 min to dissolve the nutrients the prepared solution known as dilution water was then kept in an incubator at 20 c during which the samples to be measured were prepared by first diluting them 50 in di water the 30 mℓ minimum sample volume as specified by the apha standard 87 was then extracted and added to a 300 mℓ bod bottle whose remaining volume was filled with dilution water due care was adopted during this process to avoid the formation of air bubbles a stopper was inserted to cap the bottle which was then inverted several times to mix the solution thoroughly in the meantime the blank was prepared by filling another 300 mℓ bod bottle with dilution water the oxygen probe ysi 5000 ysi inc yellow springs oh usa was subsequently inserted into each bottle to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration following which both the sample bottle and the blank were sealed with stoppers and covered with caps to prevent evaporation the prepared sample bottles were then kept in an incubator at 20 c for 5 days after which the dissolved oxygen concentration in each bottle was measured the bod value was calculated from bod mg ℓ d 1 d 2 p where d 1 and d 2 represent the dissolved oxygen of the diluted sample immediately after preparation and after 5 day incubation at 20 c respectively whereas p represents the fraction wt wt of the sample to the total combined volume the bod removal efficiencies were then estimated from r e bo d i bo d f bo d i 100 where bodi and bodf are the initial and final bod values of the samples respectively 2 4 flow field simulation the flow generated by the motion of air bubbles from the needle to the air liquid interface can alter the acoustic streaming flow induced by the transmitted acoustic wave which in turn can affecting the efficiency of the aerobic treatment as such we construct a simplified two dimensional model to examine this effect by ignoring the presence of the bubbles in the suspension and assuming to first approximation that the collective effect of their motion from the needle tip directly upwards along the needle wall to the air liquid interface due to their buoyancy induces convective motion of the liquid that can be modelled as a slip condition u u ab along the needle wall at y f l f as with the bubbles we also neglect the presence of the bacteria in the simplified model to model the generation and propagation of the acoustic wave in the substrate we employ the time domain constitutive equation governing the motion of a piezoelectric solid 69 88 90 1 d i t e ijkl s kl t ϵ ik s e k t 2 t ij t c ijkl e s kl t e kil e k t where d is the electric displacement and e the electric field related by d i ϵ ik e k in which ϵ ik are the dielectric coefficients t is the time e ikl are the piezoelectric stress coefficients t ij the stress components and c ijkl the elastic stiffness coefficients the superscripts s and e denote that these quantities are measured at constant strain s and constant electric field e respectively given that the acoustic i e electromechanical wave in the piezoelectric solid propagates much faster than the elastic wave we can treat the electric field as quasi static and therefore d i t 0 together with the infinitesimal strain displacement relationship 3 s kl t 1 2 2 ξ k x l t 2 ξ l x k t eqs 1 and 2 can then be simplified to 4 e k t e ikl ε ik s 1 2 v k x i v l x k 5

which ρ s is the mass density of the material are then solved to simulate the propagation of the acoustic wave in the piezoelectric solid to compute the saw along a ln substrate or superstrate the material properties e ikl ϵ ik s and c ijkl e are required to be transformed to the correct orientation corresponding to the 128 rotated y x cut of the ln typically used to minimize wave reflection from the boundaries split field perfectly matched layers are adopted along the left right and bottom boundaries of the piezoelectric domain see fig 2 91 92 to generate the saw a sinusoidal electric potential φ φ p p sin 2πx λ saw sin ωt in which φ p p is the peak to peak voltage and ω 2πf saw is the angular frequency with f saw 30 mhz is imposed on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate the dimensions of the piezoelectric substrate are h ln 58 6λ saw and l ln 4 7λ saw the distance between computational nodes is δx ln δy ln 1 56 μm to model the acoustic wave propagation and the resulting acoustic streaming in the liquid we adopt a lattice boltzmann model 50 93 94 based on the single relaxation time bhatnagar gross krook bgk scheme on a two dimensional square lattice with nine velocities d2q9 71 95 the lattice vectors see fig 2 are e 0 0 0 e 1 1 0 e 2 1 0 e 3 0 1 e 4 0 1 e 5 1 1 e 6 1 1 e 7 1 1 and e 8 1 1 in this scheme the ideal gas law p c f 2 ρ relates the fluid pressure p to the macroscopic fluid density 7 ρ x t i 0 8 f i x t through the sound speed in the lattice unit c f 1 3 for d2q9 whereas the macroscopic fluid velocity is defined by 8 u x t 1 ρ i 0 8 f i e i in the above the particle distribution function f i spatiotemporally evolves as 9 f i x e i δt t δt f i x t f i x t f i eq x t τ wherein x denotes the position on the lattice δt the time step and τ the relaxation time which is related to the kinematic shear viscosity of the fluid by ν c f 2 τ 1 2 δx 2 δt 10 f i eq w i ρ 1 e i u c f 2 e i u 2 c f 4 u 2 2 c f 2 is the local equilibrium distribution function whose weight factors w i for the d2q9 lattice are w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 1 9 w 5 w 6 w 7 w 8 1 36 and w 0 4 9 the first term on the rhs of eq 9 constitutes the propagation of particles between neighbouring nodes whereas the second term represents the collisions between the particles both streaming and collision components are computed separately we assume the top and bottom boundaries of the liquid film x f 0 h f respectively are non deformable u 0 i e a bounce back boundary condition applies on the left boundary y f l f a vertical velocity component u x u ab is assigned to simulate the flow induced by the air bubble as mentioned above whereas the horizontal component velocity is assumed to be zero u y 0 the total number of cycles is t 600f saw 1 and the streaming velocities u dc are computed from t 100f saw 1 to t 600f saw 1 the dimensions for the liquid domain are h f l f 80λ f whereas the distance between computational nodes is δx f δy f 0 39 μmm at the interface between the piezoelectric substrate and the liquid i e y ln 0 and y f 0 the domains are coupled through continuity in the velocities and stresses we note that the reflection of the sound wave transmitted in the liquid at the walls can be neglected since the height of the liquid h f is several times larger than the attenuation length of the sound wave in the liquid i e h f α f 1 l f α f 1 4 4 wherein the attenuation coefficient is given by α f bω 2 2ρc f 3 b 4μ 3 μ b in which μ 0 05 pa s is the viscosity of the liquid μ b its bulk viscosity ω 2πf saw the angular frequency and c f the speed of sound in the liquid to ensure consistency between the flow field in the model and that in the experiment the acoustic reynolds number 96 rea ρ f u a λ f 2πb 10 1 the streaming reynolds number redc ρ f u dc α f 1 μ 100 and the reynolds number associated with the flow induced by the air bubbles reab ρ f u ab h f μ 101 are typically comparable 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow induced by the motion of air bubbles and or the saw excitation in the absence of aeration q ab 0 the flow generated in the beaker is driven purely by the acoustic streaming induced by the acoustic waves transmitted into the liquid by the saw we observe that the maximum acoustic streaming velocity between the saw excitation powers 0 30 w p e 0 90 w are less than u dc 1 mm s fig 3 in the absence of the saw excitation p e 0 the flow generated is driven purely by the motion of the air bubbles from the tip of the needle to the air liquid interface due to buoyancy forces we observe the maximum flow velocity over the range of different air flow rates explored 0 10 ℓ min q ab 0 30 ℓ min to be larger than u ab 1 mm s fig 3 as such it can be seen that the flow velocities generated by the motion of the air bubbles alone are higher than that due to the saw excitation i e u ab u dc in the presence of both the air bubbles and the saw excitation it can be seen that the velocity of the flow can be increased either by increasing the flow rate of the compressed air q ab or by increasing the saw excitation power p e the flow field characteristics can be better understood from the results obtained from the numerical model in which two cases were simulated the flow induced by the acoustic streaming alone u ab 0 fig 4 a and the resultant flow from a combination of the air bubbles and the saw acoustic streaming when the magnitude of the acoustic streaming velocity is less than the magnitude of the flow induced by the air bubbles i e u dc u ab fig 4 b when u ab 0 the acoustic streaming flow induced by the transmitted acoustic waves from the ln substrate into the liquid results in the generation of a pair of recirculatory flows that extend further into the bulk of the liquid fig 4 a which is equivalent to the case for the anaerobic process examined previously 97 this vortex pair typically partitions the flow field into top and bottom sections which can lead to slightly inefficient mixing of liquids throughout the entire container while the dual recirculation pattern is still noticeable when aeration is introduced to the system it can be seen that the flow induced by the air bubbles leads to a weakening in the partitioning and hence the flow separation between the top and bottom sections fig 4 b more uniform mixing throughout the container is therefore expected as a consequence in the aerobic process since u ab u dc for all experimental conditions similarly we expect that more bacterial clusters are exposed to the transmitted acoustic waves as a result of the increased mixing in the system which in turn increases their propensity to be deagglomerated as we shall discuss next 3 2 bacterial cluster size an examination of the images captured from the experiments after the 2 h treatment reveals the presence of bacterial aggregates or clusters suspended in the greywater sample as shown in fig 1 b in the absence of the saw the number of bacteria clusters suspended in the solution is insignificant as a large amount of bacterial sludge appeared to sediment to the bottom of the container resulting in a clear supernatant above see fig 1 b i conversely the suspension that was exposed to the saw excitation possessed a relatively murkier appearance and without the bacteria sludge sediment see fig 1 b ii closer inspection of the suspended bacteria clusters revealed that the sample exposed to the saw excitation had significantly smaller bacterial cluster mean sizes ϕ bc 10 μm compared to those in the samples that were not exposed to the saw irradiation ϕ bc 300 μm we note that prior to each treatment the average size of the bacterial clusters extracted from the cultivation tank is typically much larger to begin with ϕ bc 10 2 10 3 m similar to that observed in previous studies 98 the dimensional reduction in the bacterial clusters suspended in the samples that were not exposed to the saw excitation can be attributed to the aeration induced shear stress that aids in the deagglomeration of the sludge flocculates as air bubbles were only generated at the center of the container the effect of aeration on the cluster size further away from the center near the sidewalls is however insignificant on the other hand the larger reduction in the size of the bacterial cluster size for samples exposed to the saw excitation can mainly be attributed to the combined effects of the acoustic radiation pressure field the acoustic streaming field as well as aeration induced flow stresses all of which serve to break up the clusters by imposing an external stress on them in addition the recirculatory flow fields induced by both the bubbles and the acoustic transmission also act to convectively mix the suspension such that there is a greater possibility of individual bacterial clusters being transported closer to the saw devices and therefore being exposed to the acoustic radiation pressure field fig 4 b consequently the bacterial cluster mean sizes tend to be smaller than the wavelength of the sound field in the suspension i e ϕ bc 10 μm λ f 50 μm at f saw 30 mhz in contrast to that observed for the anaerobic case wherein the mean bacterial cluster dimensions obtained were closer to the sound wavelength in the suspension i e ϕ bc λ f 100 μm 97 3 3 removal efficiency in the absence of the saw excitation p e 0 we observe that the total suspended solids tss removal efficiency r e increases with increasing flow rate of the compressed air q ab 0 25 ℓ min as shown in fig 5 a this increase can be attributed to both the increase in flow velocity which enhances mixing between the bacterial sludge and greywater as well as the increase in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the greywater that promotes bacteria digestion nonetheless beyond q ab 0 25 ℓ min we observe a rapid reduction in the tss removal efficiency r e which can mainly be attributed to the reduction in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the greywater this is due to the increase in air bubble size with increasing q ab as a consequence of the higher air pressures generated by the air pump that results in decreasing surface area to volume ratios and hence lower dissolution rates additionally it is also possible that there is less time for the dissolution to occur due to the faster bubbling rate since the bubbles reach the air liquid interface more quickly to confirm this we estimate the dissolved oxygen rate i e the difference in the amount of oxygen dissolved in the solutions prior to and after the 2 h treatment for solutions devoid of the bacterial sludge and the saw excitation p e 0 i e greywater alone the estimated dissolved oxygen rate appears to increase with increasing airflow rate until q ab 0 25 ℓ mins beyond which the rate begins to decrease fig 5 b therefore an excessively high flow rate of compressed air has an undesirable effect that reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen even though the increased bubbling can promote better mixing in the sample a similar trend can also be observed for greywater containing the bacterial sludge fig 5 b compared to the greywater sample devoid of the sludge we however observe lower values in the dissolved oxygen rate which is due to smaller differences between the amount of oxygen in the greywater before and after the 2 h treatment as a fraction of the dissolved oxygen has been utilized by the bacteria in the process of breaking down the waste with the saw excitation 0 30 w p e 0 90 w the tss removal efficiency can be seen to increase significantly fig 5 a higher excitation powers lead to greater tss removal efficiencies since they generate a stronger acoustic radiation pressure field and more intense acoustic streaming in the sample as seen in section 3 2 both of these effects lead to smaller bacteria clusters which in turn 1 increases the surface area to volume ratio and consequently facilitates more efficient digestion of the organic compounds by the bacteria and 2 enhances mixing which both leads to more of the bacteria clusters being exposed to and hence broken down by the acoustic and hydrodynamic stresses as well as ensuring a more uniform distribution of the dissolved oxygen concentration throughout the container from the differences in the tss removal efficiency between the treatment without and with saw excitation r e we observe an enhancement in the removal efficiency due to the saw irradiation within the range 24 δr e 16 with the highest enhancement obtained when the flow rate of compressed air is q ab 0 1 ℓ min under p e 0 90 w saw excitation the effect of the saw in enhancing the removal efficiency is slightly more significant at lower q ab because the increase in the number of air bubbles with increasing q ab can lead to scattering and reflection of the acoustic waves therefore attenuating their transmission toward the center of the beaker where the air bubbles are generated thereby resulting in poorer bacterial cluster deagglomeration efficiencies from the measured dissolved oxygen rate for the greywater sample containing the bacterial sludge exposed to the saw excitation p e 0 90 w we observe lower dissolved oxygen rates compared to that if the saw excitation were not present p e 0 therefore indicating that a larger amount of oxygen has been utilized by the bacteria due to the increase in digestion promoted by the saw excitation fig 5 b such enhancements in the tss removal efficiency with the saw irradiation can alternatively be viewed from the perspective of an increase in the efficiency of the aerobic digestion rate as an example the same level in tss removal efficiency r e 55 obtained after 2 h of treatment under the saw excitation p e 0 9 w with q ab 0 1 ℓ min can be attained in the control sample without the saw irradiation p e 0 but only over 4 h we note that a further increase in the saw excitation power to p e 1 36 w can lead to a slight further increase in tss removal efficiency r e 58 however further increases beyond p e 1 36 w led to a decrease in the tss removal efficiency fig 6 a similar trend was observed with the saw treatment of anaerobic processes 97 however the highest saw excitation power that can be applied in the treatment prior to the reduction in tss removal efficiency is significantly higher for aerobic processes p e 1 36 w as compared to anaerobic processes p e 0 48 w temperature measurements reveal that the greywater suspensions subject to the saw irradiation at the highest saw excitation power p e 0 9 w were appreciably warmer approximately 29 4 c than those not exposed to the saw at room temperature around 23 4 c following the 2 h treatment to ascertain that the increase in removal efficiency observed in fig 5 a can be directly attributed to acoustic radiation pressure and acoustic streaming effects instead of thermal effects we heated identical greywater suspensions on a hotplate to 29 4 c while maintaining the air flow rate at q ab 0 1 ℓ min in the absence of the saw we observe the removal efficiency of the heated sample r e 27 54 to be only slightly lower than that of the control sample at room temperature r e 31 59 in contrast to the 55 11 p e 0 90 w obtained with the unheated sample exposed to the saw fig 5 a under the same conditions therefore indicating that thermal effects on the removal efficiency are insignificant to further confirm the trend observed in fig 5 a wherein the removal efficiency was estimated based on the measured total suspended solids tss in the sample we estimated the removal efficiency under the highest saw excitation p e 0 9 w and that of the unexposed control from the measured cod and bod levels for five different values of q ab from the results reported in figs 7 a and b we observe qualitatively similar increases in the removal efficiency with the saw excitation to maximum values of r e 70 cod and 77 bod at q ab 0 25 ℓ min before decreasing again with higher aeration through the system compared to the unexposed control we observe the efficiency enhancement due to the saw excitation to be in the range 22 δr e 24 cod and 18 δr e 21 bod these marginal changes in the enhancement values of the cod and bod removal efficiencies therefore provide further confirmation that the saw excitation is capable of accelerating greywater treatment at least in the compressed air flow range 0 1 ℓ min q ab 0 3 ℓ min examined increasing the treatment duration can significantly increase the tss removal efficiency a twofold increase in treatment duration can be seen to lead to an increase in the efficiency from δr e 24 2 h treatment to δr e 37 4 h treatment as shown in table 1 this appears to be a more dramatic increase compared to that obtained for anaerobic processes under saw excitation wherein only a slight increase in the enhancement from δr e 13 2 h treatment to δr e 17 4 h treatment was obtained 97 this can mainly be attributed to the improved mixing of the bacterial sludge and greywater in the aerobic process which allows more sludge to be exposed to the transmitted acoustic waves thereby accelerating its decomposition as compared to the anaerobic process see fig 4 a and b we note in addition that the bacterial sludge appears to still be functional after 4 h of continuous exposure to the saw in contrast to the treatment using khz order bulk ultrasonic waves in which the treatment duration is limited to either 30 mins pre treatment or multiple exposures of short intermittent bursts to prevent inflicting irreversible damage on the bacteria 24 25 by varying the initial concentration of total suspended solids we observe that the tss removal efficiency reduces with increasing initial concentration either without or with the saw excitation table 2 this is because the initial amount of bacterial sludge prior to the 2 h treatment was maintained at the same level across the different initial tss concentrations and with only a fixed amount of waste that the bacteria were able to consume within the 2 h period a higher initial tss concentration results in a larger amount of waste that remained in the greywater sample following the treatment nonetheless the enhancement in tss removal efficiencies across the three different initial tss concentrations appeared to increase slightly i e 23 δr e 26 suggesting that the saw treatment is effective over the range of these initial concentrations 975 mg ℓ tssi 2227 mg ℓ this is in contrast to that observed for the saw treatment of anaerobic processes wherein we observed a significant reduction in the enhancement in tss removal efficiency with increasing initial tss concentration chan et al 2020 chan poh ismadi yeo and tan the difference can again be attributed to more thorough mixing of the bacteria greywater and dissolved oxygen throughout the container over the duration of the aerobic treatment process and highlights the ability of the saw excitation to treat greywater with higher concentrations of waste we also demonstrate that the enhancement of the aerobic digestion with the saw is not limited to the specific greywater sample that is treated although we note that considerable sample to sample variation in the levels of enhancement were observed as seen in table 3 the highest tss removal efficiencies were obtained with greywater sample b r e 38 without saw excitation and r e 63 in the presence of the saw excitation with p e 0 9 w which consisted of facial wash without exfoliating beads followed by greywater sample a r e 31 without saw excitation and r e 55 in the presence of the saw excitation with p e 0 9 w which is a facial scrub that contains polyethylene terephthalate pet beads the lowest tss removal efficiencies were seen for greywater sample c r e 11 without saw excitation and r e 23 in the presence of the saw excitation with p e 0 9 w which comprised facial scrub that contains hydrated silica beads the variation between samples can mainly be due to the differences in the amount of oxygen that dissolved in the greywater when it was prepared with the different facewash products as can be inferred from the measured dissolved oxygen rates in the various samples devoid of bacterial sludge following 2 h of continuous aeration greywater sample a 1 69 0 13 greywater sample b 1 82 0 16 greywater sample c 1 28 0 11 mg ℓ hr we acknowledge that it is also possible that the different components in each sample can contribute to the observed differences although an identification of the compounds is beyond the scope of the present study values for the saw enhancement in tss removal efficiency were similar for greywater samples a and b δr e 24 and 25 respectively albeit lower for sample c δr e 12 finally to show the possibility of even further improving the removal efficiency we examine a hybrid process that combines pre treating the bacterial sludge with khz order ultrasonic excitation which as alluded to in section 1 has been previously reported to lead to improvements in the tss removal efficiencies with the current mhz order saw greywater treatment method in this case the pre treatment consisted of mixng a 10 mℓ extract of aerobic bacterial sludge in a 50 mℓ beaker with 40 mℓ of tap water and agitating the suspension using a 20 khz probe ultrasonicator q700 qsonica llc newtown ct usa at approximately 2 74 w of power intermittently for 30 s with a 15 s rest period in between over a total duration of 7 5 mins the intermittent excitation being necessary to prevent overheating of the sonicator which could lead to bacterial inactivation following this pre treatment we then proceeded to allow the bacterial sludge to sediment in the beaker for 40 mins before removing the excess water and carrying out the aforementioned saw aerobic treatment as can be seen in fig 8 this ultrasound pre treatment step can be seen to further enhance the saw treatment process across the excitation power range 0 p e 1 89 w by 6 δr e 15 compared to the absence of the pre treatment in other words it is possible to obtain an approximate twofold increase in the tss removal efficiency i e from r e 32 without the pre treatment to r e 64 with this hybrid treatment technique 4 conclusions we have demonstrated that the exposure of greywater samples to low power 20 60 w ℓ mhz order saw excitation in aerobic greywater treatments can enhance the removal efficiency of the process by up to 24 with a 2 h treatment duration and up to 37 for a 4 h duration this is a significant improvement over that achieved 13 with khz order bulk ultrasonic excitation at much higher powers 2400 w ℓ 25 the improvement yielded by the saw excitation is not only because the higher frequency mhz order inflicts negligible damage to the bacteria unlike lower frequency khz order ultrasound but can also be attributed to acoustic radiation pressure and acoustic streaming effects which lead to 1 deagglomeration of the bacterial flocculates in the samples to allow for more efficient bacterial digestion of the waste given the increased surface area to volume ratio and 2 enhanced homogenization of the suspended waste bacteria and dissolved oxygen throughout the sample the enhancement is dependent on the saw excitation power higher powers lead to more intense radiation pressures and acoustic streaming and hence greater removal efficiencies alternatively to achieve a given efficiency level application of the saw leads to a significant acceleration in the aerobic digestion rate moreover the technique can also be combined with a khz order ultrasonic bacterial sludge pre treatment step to yield even further increases in the tss removal efficiency by approximately twofold the technology possesses considerable promise for adoption in domestic household aerobic treatment systems particularly given the low cost typically us 1 device and chipscale dimensions of the saw devices that facilitate ease of scale up by fabricating more transducers on the ln substrate to effect larger greywater sample volumes in addition to exploiting the possibility of device parallelization to achieve typical wastewater processing throughputs for comparative purposes four saw devices at 0 9 w excitation power were required together with a 1 w portable pump for the air supply to treat 12 mℓ of greywater which suggests an equivalent treatment cost and power requirement of 0 07 ℓ for a 2 h treatment and 158 w ℓ respectively which the cost is comparable to that typical of a 4 h treatment without saws 0 07 ℓ for the portable pump as noted the discussion a similar removal efficiency can be achieved after the 4 h treatment without saws as compared to the 2 h with saws declaration of competing interest

13246,increasing the efficiency of aerobic greywater treatment is crucial to ensure that greywater recycling can be effectively implemented in individual and community households in this work we demonstrate that exposing greywater samples to low intensity high frequency mhz order surface acoustic waves saws during the aerobic treatment process can result in increases in the total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod removal efficiencies by 24 24 and 21 respectively over a 2 h aerobic digestion period and up to 37 tss removal efficiency over a 4 h period compared to the unexposed controls these values are considerably higher than that typically obtained with lower frequency khz order bulk ultrasound particularly because the saw does not cause denaturation of bacteria in the greywater suspension unlike its low frequency counterpart the saw enhancement in removal efficiencies can primarily be attributed to the acoustic radiation pressure and acoustic streaming that it generates which act to efficiently deagglomerate the bacterial flocculates in addition to promoting more uniform mixing of the suspended waste bacteria and dissolved oxygen in the sample also the results indicate that in the presence of air bubbles in the greywater the mhz order saw treatment remains effective additionally we show that it is possible to further increase the tss removal efficiency by about twofold through a hybrid process this ability to significantly accelerate the rate of aerobic digestion to achieve a given removal efficiency level highlights the potential of this novel low cost technology for improving domestic greywater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment surface acoustic wave aerobic process greywater ultrasound 1 introduction the rapid pace of modernization and industrialization in the last century has resulted in significant increases in water pollution that in turn has led to unprecedented levels of water scarcity in many nations across the globe 1 by 2025 it is estimated that up to half of the global population will be short of freshwater supply 2 there is therefore a pressing need to develop more effective wastewater treatment platforms and in particular systems that efficiently recycle water for reuse methods for treating wastewater can be classified into physical chemical biological treatments or a combination of these methods physical treatments typically utilize membranes to filter dissolved and suspended solids 3 6 whereas chemical treatments involve for example photodegradation for the removal of contaminants in the wastewater 7 known as greywater the wastewater recycled from domestic or commercial buildings constitutes an alternative water resource for many applications due to its low pollutant concentration and potentially large volumes 8 with proper treatment greywater can be recycled for many applications such as toilet flushing irrigation and other cleaning purposes 9 given that greywater is obtained from household or commercial wastewater streams that do no contain fecal contamination biological treatment can often be employed to effectively remove microorganisms organic compounds and particulates present in the stream such treatment can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic methods the choice of which depends on scale and cost 10 as aerobic digestion is normally operated in smaller communities and has several advantages including low initial and operating costs high stabilization rates and operation simplicity in addition to constituting an odor free process 11 it is the preferred treatment for household greywater recycling in aerobic digestion organic matter is degraded using bacteria in the presence of oxygen more specifically when aerobic microorganisms are placed in a culture containing organic matter and oxygen they utilize the oxygen to decompose the organics and convert them into other materials 12 this process is utilized in many greywater treatment technologies such as sequencing batch reactors 13 14 and membrane bioreactors 15 16 although these systems are effective in treating greywater a limitation of the process is the long duration up to days or weeks required to achieve high removal efficiencies as such there is a need for techniques to increase microbial activity in sludge to enhance greywater treatment many studies have reported the benefits of using ultrasound technology to improve sludge treatment in these systems cyclic pressure sound waves at frequencies between 20 khz and 3 mhz generated using piezoelectric transducers drives cavitation of the liquid i e the formation of low pressure voids in the liquid which draw vapor from the surrounding liquid into it as they grow and oscillate resulting in the formation of cavitation bubbles 17 these cavitation bubbles themselves grow and collapse emitting shock waves that significantly increase the localized temperature and pressure above 104 k and 1 gpa 18 which then trigger other phenomena such as microstreaming and free radical formation all of which have been shown to promote sludge disintegration for example free radicals are known to play a role in the degradation of non volatile pollutants 19 whereas the large mechanical stresses associated with cavitation are capable of breaking down sludge flocculates the elevated temperatures during cavitation however have the tendency disrupt bacterial cell membranes 20 depending on the applied frequency power input and sonication duration 17 ultrasound has also been reported to promote cell growth 15 and poliferation 21 increase enzymatic activity 22 23 or increase cell membrane permeability to effect greater mass transfer 22 by employing low power 45 w ℓ 25 khz ultrasound for just 20 mins every 3 days over 17 days ding et al 24 showed that it was possible to enhance the aerobic digestion process by improving the removal efficiency r e of the total suspended solids by 6 from r e 30 to r e 36 this was attributed to the additional mechanical stresses imposed by the ultrasonic excitation which led to the breaking down of the sludge flocculates to result in 1 an enhancement in the total surface area to volume ratio 2 the generation of bulk convective liquid recirculation acoustic streaming which leads to an enhancement in the nutrient and waste mass transfer and 3 an enhancement in enzymatic activity of the sludge due to better selectivity between the enzyme and substrate all of which result in more efficient digestion high power 2400 w ℓ 20 khz ultrasound over pre treatment durations of 30 mins for 15 days has also been demonstrated to enhance aerobic bacteria treatment increasing the total suspended solids removal efficiency by 13 from r e 25 to r e 38 25 the improvement being attributed to the increase in biodegradability and decomposition efficiency of the sludge digestion due to the breakdown of sludge flocculates despite these benefits in enhancing aerobic digestion the use of ultrasound is severely limited by the necessity for long irradiation durations a significant reduction in treatment efficacy can result if the ultrasound intensity is not carefully controlled during this time 23 24 26 due to sludge disintegration in addition to excessive cell lysis and apoptosis that decreases microbial activity 27 to circumvent this we examine the use of high frequency mhz order surface acoustic waves saws in place of the low frequency khz order ultrasound excitation besides the difference in their frequencies saws which are nanometer order amplitude electromechanical waves are confined to the surface of a piezoelectric substrate as opposed to the bulk nature of their ultrasonic counterparts and have been shown to be a markedly more efficient mechanism for coupling energy from a solid into a liquid with much lower losses 28 29 and as such have been employed for a myriad of microfluidic applications 28 31 including particle trapping sorting and manipulation 32 35 sessile and microchannel droplet translation 36 44 micropumping 45 50 micromixing and microcentrifugation 51 59 jetting 60 62 filtration 63 64 and nebulization 65 71 more importantly the lower powers and higher frequencies associated with the saw are insufficient to drive cavitation 72 and hence does not lead to the denaturation of biomolecules and cells consequently saws have been demonstrated as an efficient tool for cell stimulation to effect a number of biological and cellular processes 73 74 such as enhancing cell proliferation 75 76 seed germination 77 intracellular transport 78 80 piezochannel activation 81 exosome production 82 and acoustotaxis 83 whilst maintaining high cell viability and in the case of stem cells their ability to differentiate 84 in this work we demonstrate the effectiveness of applying these mhz order saws to enhance aerobic greywater treatment given that the aeration process can affect acoustic wave propagation in the greywater sample and hence the effectiveness of the technique the setup is configured to excite the saw devices at higher powers to effect considerably higher difference in removal efficiencies up to r e 24 thus demonstrating the effectiveness of this chipscale high frequency acoustomicrofluidic system for the treatment of aerobic bacterial sludge various operating conditions such as the airflow rate excitation power and treatment duration among others are investigated for different greywater samples moreover we also demonstrate that the removal efficiency can be increased even further by approximately twofold through a hybrid process involving the combination of pre treatment of the bacterial sludge with khz order ultrasound with the mhz order saw greywater treatment 2 experimental method and numerical simulation 2 1 saw devices the saw devices comprised 128 rotated y cut x propagating single crystal lithium niobate linbo3 piezoelectric substrates roditi ltd london uk photolithographically patterned with focusing elliptical single phase unidirectional transducers fe spudts as shown in the inset in fig 1 a a thin layer of hydrophobic coating teflon af dupont corp wilmington de usa was deposited over the transducers to prevent any possible damage when air bubbles generated at the air liquid interface come into contact with the transducers to generate the saw a sinusoidal electric signal from a function generator afg1062 tektronix inc beaverton or usa and high frequency amplifier zhl 5 w 1 mini circuits inc ny usa was applied to the fe spudt at a frequency that corresponds to the resonant frequency of the transducer f saw 30 5 mhz which is determined by the finger spacing and width to increase the efficiency of the system an amplitude modulation scheme similar to that previously reported 56 63 was employed the total input electric power of the modulated signal

at f m 1 khz 2 2 greywater and bacterial sludge mixed culture bacteria were obtained from the wastewater treatment system of a local palm oil processing plant sime darby east oil mill carey island selangor malaysia the culture was adapted to aerobic conditions and greywater prior to their use for this study through intermittent feeding of greywater and continuous aeration in the mixed culture tank prior to their extraction from the tank the entire suspension in the tank was stirred and the bacteria left to sediment on the bottom of the tank for approximately 1 h the extracted bacteria was then transferred to a beaker filled with greywater produced by the washing of hands with three different commercial facial exfoliating scrubs under a running tap sample a face clay mask scrub freeman beauty beverly hills ca usa sample b garnier pureactive anti acne white l oreal jakarta indonesia sample c simple unilever london uk the amount of face scrub the duration of washing and the amount of tap water used were carefully controlled to ensure consistency in each greywater sample for each experiment 3 mℓ of mixed culture aerobic bacteria and 12 mℓ of greywater were extracted using a syringe and mixed in a 25 mℓ beaker ϕ b 32 mm in diameter and h b 50 mm in height at a ratio of 1 4 i e one part mixed culture bacteria to 4 parts greywater the sidewalls of the beaker were fitted with four saw devices arranged orthogonally to each other as partially illustrated in fig 1 a conservatively assuming that all of the saw input electrical power i e 0 30 w p e 0 90 w is transmitted into the greywater we estimate acoustic densities in the range 20 60 w ℓ which is similar to that used in low power khz order ultrasound work reported in the literature 24 to supply air into the greywater bacterial suspension for aerobic digestion a stainless steel syringe needle of diameter ϕ n 600 μm 91 020 hamilton franklin ma usa connected to a variable air flow meter model 2510 brooks instrument hatfield pa usa and a portable mini air pump 1 w via rubber hosing was submerged in the middle of the beaker to a distance approximately h n 5 mm away between the needle tip and the bottom of the beaker see fig 1 a upon activation of the air pump air bubbles were generated at the tip of the needle with a volume flow rate q ab five different air flow rates were used q ab 0 10 ℓ min 0 15 ℓ min 0 20 ℓ min 0 25 ℓ min and 0 30 ℓ min due to their buoyancy the air bubbles moved rapidly upward to the air liquid interface at the same time driving flow within the greywater suspension the maximum velocity of the induced streaming flow v max generated either by the bubbling alone or in combination with the acoustic streaming generated by the saw was estimated by monitoring the trajectories of the bubbles at 10 frames s using a video camera am7915mzt dino lite anmo electronics taiwan with the aid of particle tracking software diatrack v3 03 semasopht north epping nsw australia 86 concurrently we also estimated the diameter of these air bubbles from the acquired images under different conditions the amount of oxygen dissolved in the greywater can change this was quantified using a dissolved oxygen meter ysi 5000 ysi inc yellow springs oh usa before and after the treatment for both samples with and without the saw the dissolved oxygen rate was estimated from dor do f do i 60 duration in mins where dof is the dissolved oxygen following treatment mg ℓ and doi is that prior to the treatment mg ℓ while the samples were exposed to the saw irradiation under a continuous supply of air over a duration of 2 h control experiments in the absence of the saw irradiation were conducted in parallel under the same aeration conditions over the same 2 h duration the density viscosity and temperature of the greywater suspension was measured at 1 h intervals during the treatment process using a force tensiometer attension sigma 702 biolin scientific gothenburg sweden viscometer sv 10 sine wave vibro viscometer a d co ltd tokyo japan and thermocouple connected to a data logger gl820 graphtec corp irvine ca usa additionally we also examined the uniformity of the bacteria flocculates or clusters in the greywater suspension for each experiment 100 μℓ was extracted from the top half of the beaker before and after the 2 h treatment process and placed atop a microscope slide the samples were then left at room temperature to dry in air and subsequently examined under brightfield microscopy bx41m olympus tokyo japan and field emission scanning electron microscopy su8010 hitachi gmbh krefeld germany given that the excitation of saws can result in a slight increase in the temperature of greywater suspensions we also conducted additional controlled experiments to examine the effect of temperature alone in the absence of the saw in these experiments the beaker containing the greywater suspension was placed on a hot plate c mag hs7 ika werke gmbh co kg cologne germany and the temperature of the suspension increased to a value similar to that measured when it is in the presence of the saw excitation 2 3 removal efficiency to quantify the removal efficiency small sample volumes were extracted from the greywater bacterial suspensions before and after the 2 h treatment specifically the suspensions were stirred for approximately 3 s and left for 10 mins for the bacteria to sediment this results in the suspension partitioning into two regions a region that comprises predominantly greywater at the top half of the beaker and a region predominantly containing mixed culture aerobic bacteria at the bottom half of the beaker 120 μℓ volume samples were then extracted from the top region with a micropipette and placed in a 1 5 mℓ microcentrifuge tube for subsequent analysis of its content for all of the extracted samples total suspended solids tss measurements were conducted in accordance with the american public health association apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 87 briefly a blank sample cell was filled with 10 mℓ of di water cleaned externally using a delicate task wipe kimtech kimberly clark worldwide inc irving tx usa and placed into the cell holder of a portable spectrophotometer dr2800 hach loveland co usa to calibrate the system at 0 mg ℓ tss the experimental sample on the other hand was prepared by diluting the extracted solution in di water by 100 from which 10 mℓ was extracted into another sample cell and placed into the cell holder of the portable spectrophotometer to measure its tss value measurements were conducted both before and after treatment and the tss removal efficiencies calculated from r e ts s i ts s f ts s i 100 in which tss i and tss f are the initial and final total suspended solid concentrations of the sample respectively the tss removal efficiencies were then estimated for the conditions of varying saw excitation power p e and flow rate of compressed air pumped into the greywater suspensions q ab in addition the effectiveness of this technique by varying the initial concentration was also investigated besides the tss removal efficiency we also quantified the removal efficiency based on chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod as specified by the apha standards 87 the cod is a measure of the amount of dissolved oxygen required for the chemical oxidation of total organic matter present in the greywater sample whereas the bod is a measure of the dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms to decompose the organic matter present in the greywater sample at a specific temperature and over a specific period for the cod test the digital reactor block drb200 hach loveland co usa was first switched on and preheated to 150 c next 100 μℓ of the sample was extracted and diluted 40 with di water the solution was stirred evenly from which a 2 mℓ sample was extracted and added into the cod vial for the selected low range 3 150 mg ℓ in the meantime 2 mℓ of di water was added into another cod vial to be used as the blank the vials were closed tightly and inverted gently several times to mix the samples thoroughly they were then placed in the preheated drb200 reactor and heated for 2 h after which the reactor was switched off and the vials left to cool in the reactor for approximately 20 mins to below 120 c the vials were then inverted again several times whilst still warm and subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature for the cod measurements both vials were cleaned externally with delicate task wipers kimtech kimberly clark worldwide inc irving tx usa prior to the measurements the blank was first inserted into the cell holder of the portable spectrophotometer to calibrate the reading to 0 mg ℓ following which the sample vial was inserted into the cell holder to measure its cod removal efficiency which can be calculated from r e co d i co d f cod 100 where codi and codf are the initial and final cod values of the samples respectively for the bod test clean jugs were first filled with clean distilled water and shaken to saturate the water with air bod nutrient buffer pillow hach loveland co usa was then shaken thoroughly before being added into the distilled water the jugs were capped and shaken vigorously for 1 min to dissolve the nutrients the prepared solution known as dilution water was then kept in an incubator at 20 c during which the samples to be measured were prepared by first diluting them 50 in di water the 30 mℓ minimum sample volume as specified by the apha standard 87 was then extracted and added to a 300 mℓ bod bottle whose remaining volume was filled with dilution water due care was adopted during this process to avoid the formation of air bubbles a stopper was inserted to cap the bottle which was then inverted several times to mix the solution thoroughly in the meantime the blank was prepared by filling another 300 mℓ bod bottle with dilution water the oxygen probe ysi 5000 ysi inc yellow springs oh usa was subsequently inserted into each bottle to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration following which both the sample bottle and the blank were sealed with stoppers and covered with caps to prevent evaporation the prepared sample bottles were then kept in an incubator at 20 c for 5 days after which the dissolved oxygen concentration in each bottle was measured the bod value was calculated from bod mg ℓ d 1 d 2 p where d 1 and d 2 represent the dissolved oxygen of the diluted sample immediately after preparation and after 5 day incubation at 20 c respectively whereas p represents the fraction wt wt of the sample to the total combined volume the bod removal efficiencies were then estimated from r e bo d i bo d f bo d i 100 where bodi and bodf are the initial and final bod values of the samples respectively 2 4 flow field simulation the flow generated by the motion of air bubbles from the needle to the air liquid interface can alter the acoustic streaming flow induced by the transmitted acoustic wave which in turn can affecting the efficiency of the aerobic treatment as such we construct a simplified two dimensional model to examine this effect by ignoring the presence of the bubbles in the suspension and assuming to first approximation that the collective effect of their motion from the needle tip directly upwards along the needle wall to the air liquid interface due to their buoyancy induces convective motion of the liquid that can be modelled as a slip condition u u ab along the needle wall at y f l f as with the bubbles we also neglect the presence of the bacteria in the simplified model to model the generation and propagation of the acoustic wave in the substrate we employ the time domain constitutive equation governing the motion of a piezoelectric solid 69 88 90 1 d i t e ijkl s kl t ϵ ik s e k t 2 t ij t c ijkl e s kl t e

coefficients t ij the stress components and c ijkl the elastic stiffness coefficients the superscripts s and e denote that these quantities are measured at constant strain s and constant electric field e respectively given that the acoustic i e electromechanical wave in the piezoelectric solid propagates much faster than the elastic wave we can treat the electric field as quasi static and therefore d i t 0 together with the infinitesimal strain displacement relationship 3 s kl t 1 2 2 ξ k x l t 2 ξ l x k t eqs 1 and 2 can then be simplified to 4 e k t e ikl ε ik s 1 2 v k x i v l x k 5

acoustic streaming in the liquid we adopt a lattice boltzmann model 50 93 94 based on the single relaxation time bhatnagar gross krook bgk scheme on a two dimensional square lattice with nine

between neighbouring nodes whereas the second term represents the collisions between the particles both streaming and collision components are computed separately we assume the top and bottom boundaries of the liquid film x f 0 h f respectively are non deformable u 0 i e a bounce back boundary condition applies on the left boundary y f l f a vertical velocity component u x u ab is assigned to simulate the flow induced by the air bubble as mentioned above whereas the horizontal component velocity is assumed to be zero u y 0 the total number of cycles is t 600f saw 1 and the streaming

interface between the piezoelectric substrate and the liquid i e y ln 0 and y f 0 the domains are coupled through continuity in the velocities and stresses we note that the reflection of the sound

by the motion of air bubbles and or the saw excitation in the absence of aeration q ab 0 the flow generated in the beaker is driven purely by the acoustic streaming induced by the acoustic waves transmitted into the liquid by the saw we observe that the maximum acoustic streaming velocity between the saw excitation powers 0 30 w p e 0 90 w are less than u dc 1 mm s fig 3 in the absence of the saw excitation p e 0 the flow generated is driven purely by the motion of the air bubbles from the tip of the needle to the air liquid interface due to buoyancy forces we observe the maximum flow velocity over the range of different air flow rates explored 0 10 ℓ min q ab 0 30 ℓ min to be larger than u ab 1 mm s fig 3 as such it can be seen that the flow velocities generated by the motion of the air bubbles alone are higher than that due to the saw excitation i e u ab u dc in the presence of both the air bubbles and the saw excitation it can be seen that the velocity of the flow can be increased either by increasing the flow rate of the compressed air q ab or by increasing the saw excitation power p e the flow field characteristics can be better understood from the results obtained from the numerical model in which two cases were simulated the flow induced by the acoustic streaming alone u ab 0 fig 4 a and the resultant flow from a combination of the air bubbles and the saw acoustic streaming when the magnitude of the acoustic streaming velocity is less than the magnitude of the flow induced by the air bubbles i e u dc u ab fig 4 b when u ab 0 the acoustic streaming flow induced by the transmitted acoustic waves from the ln substrate into the liquid results in the generation of a pair of recirculatory flows that extend further into the bulk of the liquid fig 4 a which is equivalent to the case for the anaerobic process examined previously 97 this vortex pair typically partitions the flow field into top and bottom sections which can lead to slightly inefficient mixing of liquids throughout the entire container while the dual recirculation pattern is still noticeable when aeration is introduced to the system it can be seen that the flow induced by the air bubbles leads to a weakening in the partitioning and hence the flow separation between the top and bottom sections fig 4 b more uniform mixing throughout the container is therefore expected as a consequence in the aerobic process since u ab u dc for all experimental conditions similarly we expect that more bacterial clusters are exposed to the transmitted acoustic waves as a result of the increased mixing in the system which in turn increases their propensity to be deagglomerated as we shall discuss next 3 2 bacterial cluster size an examination of the images captured from the experiments after the 2 h treatment reveals the presence of bacterial aggregates or clusters suspended in the greywater sample as shown in fig 1 b in the absence of the saw the number of bacteria clusters suspended in the solution is insignificant as a large amount of bacterial sludge appeared to sediment to the bottom of the container resulting in a clear supernatant above see fig 1 b i conversely the suspension that was exposed to the saw excitation possessed a relatively murkier appearance and without the bacteria sludge sediment see fig 1 b ii closer inspection of the suspended bacteria clusters revealed that the sample exposed to the saw excitation had significantly smaller bacterial cluster mean sizes ϕ bc 10 μm compared to those in the samples that were not exposed to the saw irradiation ϕ bc 300 μm we note that prior to each treatment the average size of the bacterial clusters extracted from the cultivation tank is typically much larger to begin with ϕ bc 10 2 10 3 m similar to that observed in previous studies 98 the dimensional reduction in the bacterial clusters suspended in the samples that were not exposed to the saw excitation can be attributed to the aeration induced shear stress that aids in the deagglomeration of the sludge flocculates as air bubbles were only generated at the center of the container the effect of aeration on the cluster size further away from the center near the sidewalls is however insignificant on the other hand the larger reduction in the size of the bacterial cluster size for samples exposed to the saw excitation can mainly be attributed to the combined effects of the acoustic radiation pressure field the acoustic streaming field as well as aeration induced flow stresses all of which serve to break up the clusters by imposing an external stress on them in addition the recirculatory flow fields induced by both the bubbles and the acoustic transmission also act to convectively mix the suspension such that there is a greater possibility of individual bacterial clusters being transported closer to the saw devices and therefore being exposed to the acoustic radiation pressure field fig 4 b consequently the bacterial cluster mean sizes tend to be smaller than the wavelength of the sound field in the suspension i e ϕ bc 10 μm λ f 50 μm at f saw 30 mhz in contrast to that observed for the anaerobic case wherein the mean bacterial cluster dimensions obtained were closer to the sound wavelength in the suspension i e ϕ bc λ f 100 μm 97 3 3 removal efficiency in the absence of the saw excitation p e 0 we observe that the total suspended solids tss removal efficiency r e increases with increasing flow rate of the compressed air q ab 0 25 ℓ min as shown in fig 5 a this increase can be attributed to both the increase in flow velocity which enhances mixing between the bacterial sludge and greywater as well as the increase in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the greywater that promotes bacteria digestion nonetheless beyond q ab 0 25 ℓ min we observe a rapid reduction in the tss removal efficiency r e which can mainly be attributed to the reduction in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the greywater this is due to the increase in air bubble size with increasing q ab as a consequence of the higher air pressures generated by the air pump that results in decreasing surface area to volume ratios and hence lower dissolution rates additionally it is also possible that there is less time for the dissolution to occur due to the faster bubbling rate since the bubbles reach the air liquid interface more quickly to confirm this we estimate the dissolved oxygen rate i e the difference in the amount of oxygen dissolved in the solutions prior to and after the 2 h treatment for solutions devoid of the bacterial sludge and the saw excitation p e 0 i e greywater alone the estimated dissolved oxygen rate appears to increase with increasing airflow rate until q ab 0 25 ℓ mins beyond which the rate begins to decrease fig 5 b therefore an excessively high flow rate of compressed air has an undesirable effect that reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen even though the increased bubbling can promote better mixing in the sample a similar trend can also be observed for greywater containing the bacterial sludge fig 5 b compared to the greywater sample devoid of the sludge we however observe lower values in the dissolved oxygen rate which is due to smaller differences between the amount of oxygen in the greywater before and after the 2 h treatment as a fraction of the dissolved oxygen has been utilized by the bacteria in the process of breaking down the waste with the saw excitation 0 30 w p e 0 90 w the tss removal efficiency can be seen to increase significantly fig 5 a higher excitation powers lead to greater tss removal efficiencies since they generate a stronger acoustic radiation pressure field and more intense acoustic streaming in the sample as seen in section 3 2 both of these effects lead to smaller bacteria clusters which in turn 1 increases the surface area to volume ratio and consequently facilitates more efficient digestion of the organic compounds by the bacteria and 2 enhances mixing which both leads to more of the bacteria clusters being exposed to and hence broken down by the acoustic and hydrodynamic stresses as well as ensuring a more uniform distribution of the dissolved oxygen concentration throughout the container from the differences in the tss removal efficiency between the treatment without and with saw excitation r e we observe an enhancement in the removal efficiency due to the saw irradiation within the range 24 δr e 16 with the highest enhancement obtained when the flow rate of compressed air is q ab 0 1 ℓ min under p e 0 90 w saw excitation the effect of the saw in enhancing the removal efficiency is slightly more significant at lower q ab because the increase in the number of air bubbles with increasing q ab can lead to scattering and reflection of the acoustic waves therefore attenuating their transmission toward the center of the beaker where the air bubbles are generated thereby resulting in poorer bacterial cluster deagglomeration efficiencies from the measured dissolved oxygen rate for the greywater sample containing the bacterial sludge exposed to the saw excitation p e 0 90 w we observe lower dissolved oxygen rates compared to that if the saw excitation were not present p e 0 therefore indicating that a larger amount of oxygen has been utilized by the bacteria due to the increase in digestion promoted by the saw excitation fig 5 b such enhancements in the tss removal efficiency with the saw irradiation can alternatively be viewed from the perspective of an increase in the efficiency of the aerobic digestion rate as an example the same level in tss removal efficiency r e 55 obtained after 2 h of treatment under the saw excitation p e 0 9 w with q ab 0 1 ℓ min can be attained in the control sample without the saw irradiation p e 0 but only over 4 h we note that a further increase in the saw excitation power to p e 1 36 w can lead to a slight further increase in tss removal efficiency r e 58 however further increases beyond p e 1 36 w led to a decrease in the tss removal efficiency fig 6 a similar trend was observed with the saw treatment of anaerobic processes 97 however the highest saw excitation power that can be applied in the treatment prior to the reduction in tss removal efficiency is significantly higher for aerobic processes p e 1 36 w as compared to anaerobic processes p e 0 48 w temperature measurements reveal that the greywater suspensions subject to the saw irradiation at the highest saw excitation power p e 0 9 w were appreciably warmer approximately 29 4 c than those not exposed to the saw at room temperature around 23 4 c following the 2 h treatment to ascertain that the increase in removal efficiency observed in fig 5 a can be directly attributed to acoustic radiation pressure and acoustic streaming effects instead of thermal effects we heated identical greywater suspensions on a hotplate to 29 4 c while maintaining the air flow rate at q ab 0 1 ℓ min in the absence of the saw we observe the removal efficiency of the heated sample r e 27 54 to be only slightly lower than that of the control sample at room temperature r e 31 59 in contrast to the 55 11 p e 0 90 w obtained with the unheated sample exposed to the saw fig 5 a under the same conditions therefore indicating that thermal effects on the removal efficiency are insignificant to further confirm the trend observed in fig 5 a wherein the removal efficiency was estimated based on the measured total suspended solids tss in the sample we estimated the removal efficiency under the highest saw excitation p e 0 9 w and that of the unexposed control from the measured cod and bod levels for five different values of q ab from the results reported in figs 7 a and b we observe qualitatively similar increases in the removal efficiency with the saw excitation to maximum values of r e 70 cod and 77 bod at q ab 0 25 ℓ min before decreasing again with higher aeration through the system compared to the unexposed control we observe the efficiency enhancement due to the saw excitation to be in the range 22 δr e 24 cod and 18 δr e 21 bod these marginal changes in the enhancement values of the cod and bod removal efficiencies therefore provide further confirmation that the saw excitation is capable of accelerating greywater treatment at least in the compressed air flow range 0 1 ℓ min q ab 0 3 ℓ min examined increasing the treatment duration can significantly increase the tss removal efficiency a twofold increase in treatment duration can be seen to lead to an increase in the efficiency from δr e 24 2 h treatment to δr e 37 4 h treatment as shown in table 1 this appears to be a more dramatic increase compared to that obtained for anaerobic processes under saw excitation wherein only a slight increase in the enhancement from δr e 13 2 h treatment to δr e 17 4 h treatment was obtained 97 this can mainly be attributed to the improved mixing of the bacterial sludge and greywater in the aerobic process which allows more sludge to be exposed to the transmitted acoustic waves thereby accelerating its decomposition as compared to the anaerobic process see fig 4 a and b we note in addition that the bacterial sludge appears to still be functional after 4 h of continuous exposure to the saw in contrast to the treatment using khz order bulk ultrasonic waves in which the treatment duration is limited to either 30 mins pre treatment or multiple exposures of short intermittent bursts to prevent inflicting irreversible damage on the bacteria 24 25 by varying the initial concentration of total suspended solids we observe that the tss removal efficiency reduces with increasing initial concentration either without or with the saw excitation table 2 this is because the initial amount of bacterial sludge prior to the 2 h treatment was maintained at the same level across the different initial tss concentrations and with only a fixed amount of waste that the bacteria were able to consume within the 2 h period a higher initial tss concentration results in a larger amount of waste that remained in the greywater sample following the treatment nonetheless the enhancement in tss removal efficiencies across the three different initial tss concentrations appeared to increase slightly i e 23 δr e 26 suggesting that the saw treatment is effective over the range of these initial concentrations 975 mg ℓ tssi 2227 mg ℓ this is in contrast to that observed for the saw treatment of anaerobic processes wherein we observed a significant reduction in the enhancement in tss removal efficiency with increasing initial tss concentration chan et al 2020 chan poh ismadi yeo and tan the difference can again be attributed to more thorough mixing of the bacteria greywater and dissolved oxygen throughout the container over the duration of the aerobic treatment process and highlights the ability of the saw excitation to treat greywater with higher concentrations of waste we also demonstrate that the enhancement of the aerobic digestion with the saw is not limited to the specific greywater sample that is treated although we note that considerable sample to sample variation in the levels of enhancement were observed as seen in table 3 the highest tss removal efficiencies were obtained with greywater sample b r e 38 without saw excitation and r e 63 in the presence of the saw excitation with p e 0 9 w which consisted of facial wash without exfoliating beads followed by greywater sample a r e 31 without saw excitation and r e 55 in the presence of the saw excitation with p e 0 9 w which is a facial scrub that contains polyethylene terephthalate pet beads the lowest tss removal efficiencies were seen for greywater sample c r e 11 without saw excitation and r e 23 in the presence of the saw excitation with p e 0 9 w which comprised facial scrub that contains hydrated silica beads the variation between samples can mainly be due to the differences in the amount of oxygen that dissolved in the greywater when it was prepared with the different facewash products as can be inferred from the measured dissolved oxygen rates in the various samples devoid of bacterial sludge following 2 h of continuous aeration greywater sample a 1 69 0 13 greywater sample b 1 82 0 16 greywater sample c 1 28 0 11 mg ℓ hr we acknowledge that it is also possible that the different components in each sample can contribute to the observed differences although an identification of the compounds is beyond the scope of the present study values for the saw enhancement in tss removal efficiency were similar for greywater samples a and b δr e 24 and 25 respectively albeit lower for sample c δr e 12 finally to show the possibility of even further improving the removal efficiency we examine a hybrid process that combines pre treating the bacterial sludge with khz order ultrasonic excitation which as alluded to in section 1 has been previously reported to lead to improvements in the tss removal efficiencies with the current mhz order saw greywater treatment method in this case the pre treatment consisted of mixng a 10 mℓ extract of aerobic bacterial sludge in a 50 mℓ beaker with 40 mℓ of tap water and agitating the suspension using a 20 khz probe ultrasonicator q700 qsonica llc newtown ct usa at approximately 2 74 w of power intermittently for 30 s with a 15 s rest period in between over a total duration of 7 5 mins the intermittent excitation being necessary to prevent overheating of the sonicator which could lead to bacterial inactivation following this pre treatment we then proceeded to allow the bacterial sludge to sediment in the beaker for 40 mins before removing the excess water and carrying out the aforementioned saw aerobic treatment as can be seen in fig 8 this ultrasound pre treatment step can be seen to further enhance the saw treatment process across the excitation power range 0 p e 1 89 w by 6 δr e 15 compared to the absence of the pre treatment in other words it is possible to obtain an approximate twofold increase in the tss removal efficiency i e from r e 32 without the pre treatment to r e 64 with this hybrid treatment technique 4 conclusions we have demonstrated that the exposure of greywater samples to low power 20 60 w ℓ mhz order saw excitation in aerobic greywater treatments can enhance the removal efficiency of the process by up to 24 with a 2 h treatment duration and up to 37 for a 4 h duration this is a significant improvement over that achieved 13 with khz order bulk ultrasonic excitation at much higher powers 2400 w ℓ 25 the improvement yielded by the saw excitation is not only because the higher frequency mhz order inflicts negligible damage to the bacteria unlike lower frequency khz order ultrasound but can also be attributed to acoustic radiation pressure and acoustic streaming effects which lead to 1 deagglomeration of the bacterial flocculates in the samples to allow for more efficient bacterial digestion of the waste given the increased surface area to volume ratio and 2 enhanced homogenization of the suspended waste bacteria and dissolved oxygen throughout the sample the enhancement is dependent on the saw excitation power higher powers lead to more intense radiation pressures and acoustic streaming and hence greater removal efficiencies alternatively to achieve a given efficiency level application of the saw leads to a significant acceleration in the aerobic digestion rate moreover the technique can also be combined with a khz order ultrasonic bacterial sludge pre treatment step to yield even further increases in the tss removal efficiency by approximately twofold the technology possesses considerable promise for adoption in domestic household aerobic treatment systems particularly given the low cost typically us 1 device and chipscale dimensions of the saw devices that facilitate ease of scale up by fabricating more transducers on the ln substrate to effect larger greywater sample volumes in addition to exploiting the possibility of device parallelization to achieve typical wastewater processing throughputs for comparative purposes four saw devices at 0 9 w excitation power were required together with a 1 w portable pump for the air supply to treat 12 mℓ of greywater which suggests an equivalent treatment cost and power requirement of 0 07 ℓ for a 2 h treatment and 158 w ℓ respectively which the cost is comparable to that typical of a 4 h treatment without saws 0 07 ℓ for the portable pump as noted the discussion a similar removal efficiency can be achieved after the 4 h treatment without saws as compared to the 2 h with saws declaration of competing interest

13247,studies that characterize the microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants wwtps are numerous yet similar studies in industrial wwtps treating fish canning effluents are limited the microbial communities in samples of 4 fish canning wwtps that operated under different nacl concentrations were investigated by qpcr and partial 16s rrna gene illumina sequencing the absolute abundances of key microbial populations total bacteria archaea and fungi ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob mycolata candidatus microthrix ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter presented statistical differences among the wwtps the nacl concentration negatively affected the absolute abundance of bacteria and fungi filamentous and phosphate pao and glycogen gao accumulating bacteria while aob and ca microthrix populations were statistically higher in the wwtp with higher nacl contents on the other hand the main bacterial operational taxonomic units otus were classified as members of kouleothrix chloroflexia chloroflexi and tetrasphaera actinomycetia actinobacteria family beijerinckiaceae alphaproteobacteria proteobacteria order betaproteobacteriales gammaproteobacteria proteobacteria sphingobacteriales sphingobacteriia bacteroidetes and frankiales actinobacteria actinobacteria class anaerolineae chloroflexi phylum chloroflexi and bacteria unclassified the structure of the bacterial community was highly dissimilar among the 4 wwtps as the identities of the dominant otus differed significantly among them therefore the individual characteristics of the different wwtps mainly nacl concentration were responsible for the narrow assemblage of the bacterial communities different otus belonging to the phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi gemmatimonadetes and proteobacteria were revealed as salt tolerant taking into account these results nacl content was an important driver of the abundance of microbial populations and the bacterial community structure in the analysed industrial facilities graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fish canning wwtp qpcr bacterial diversity halophilic bacteria 1 introduction in the last 30 years the total per capita consumption of fish and seafood has increased globally by 50 1 this is due to the consumer s perception that fish is a healthy alternative to other protein sources 2 to meet this demand processed fish production has been increased with a rapid growth of fish preserving and fish canning industries across the world 3 4 biological wastewater ww treatment depends mainly on the structure and function of the microbial communities that carry out the transformation of contaminants and removal of nutrients 5 effective ww treatment is necessary to avoid environmental damage after the discharge of effluents into natural water streams the abundance and diversity of the activated sludge as bacterial biomass determines the metabolic pathways that occur in the ww treatment plant wwtp that finally dictate the quality of the treated effluent different operational and environmental parameters influence the abundance of key microbial populations and regulate the assembly of the complex bacterial communities of the as 6 7 fish canning industries consume large quantities of water that are utilized in different stages of fish processing generating high amounts of ww 8 9 in general treatment of industrial ww is often much more difficult than that of urban wastewater 10 particularly fish canning wws are characterized by a high salt content and high loads of organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and fat 8 high salt concentration in wwtps results in osmotic stress causing disintegration of cells by reducing cell turgor and dehydrating cytoplasm 11 consequently a nacl increase can negatively impact on the treatment processes of these ww as biological activity can decrease if salinity raises in addition high chemical oxygen demand cod and particulate matter concentration usually hinders fish canning ww treatment due to these inconveniences these effluents can cause drastic effects on the environment if not properly managed and disposed of to cope with these problems different types of ww treatment systems have been tested 12 13 however a large knowledge gap still exists it is unclear whether microbial populations abundance and community assemblages are affected by the salinity and strength of fish canning ww furthermore the understanding of the relationships between the microbial communities and the operational environmental parameters of full scale industrial wwtps is limited therefore answers to these questions represent a challenge in the field of environmental engineering 6 14 this study investigated microbial communities structure in the as of 4 different wwtps that receive influents from fish canning industries differing in their nacl content in order to address the following questions 1 were there significant differences in the abundances of key microbial populations and the bacterial community structures among facilities 2 is there a common bacterial core among the different wwtps 3 what were the relationships between microbial populations abundances and operational variables 4 was the nacl content an important driver of the shaping of bacterial communities structure and 5 which were the halophilic halophobic bacteria of the as therefore the information collected in this study will contribute to the characterization and understanding of the microbial community structure and ecology in fish canning wwtps in addition due to the limited scientific literature addressing the effect of nacl on the bacterial diversity in this particular type of industrial facilities the assignation of the potential roles of the dominant otus found in the current work will help to understand the biological treatment of other highly saline effluents 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling ww and as from four different fish

products were cloned with the aid of the topo ta cloning system invitrogen ca usa clones carrying plasmids showing 98 and 97 identity to the sequences of the 16s rrna of accumulibacter genebank accession cp001715 1 and competibacter genebank accession ay962319 1 were used as standards 2 5 bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing amplification two independent replicates per wwtp of the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was performed using the prokaryotic specific primers pro341f 5 cctacgggnbgcascag 3 and pro805r 5 gactacnvgggtatctaatcc 3 modified by takahashi et al 21 raw data from illumina miseq sequencing were processed using the mothurmiseq guidelines in the software mothur v1 44 1 22 the different first and reverse fastq read files were combined to generate the individual files quality control primer trimming and filtering were made according to the default settings improved sequences were merged into unique sequences that were aligned against the silva seed v132 database aligned sequences were subjected to a de noise analysis three difference mismatches and putative chimeric sequences were detected and removed using the vsearch tool pairwise distances between aligned dna sequences were conducted for the remaining unique sequences and operational taxonomic units otus were defined according to their phylogeny distance 97 similarity otus with an abundance of only 1 sequence read in the whole set were considered pcr artifacts and were removed for diversity analysis the consensus sequence of the different otus was obtained through the get oturep command finally each consensus sequence was taxonomically classified using the silva seed v132 database that follows the whole genome taxonomy recently proposed by parks et al 23 rarefaction curves for the otus abundance data were constructed using the analytic rarefaction software university of georgia athens usa https strata uga edu software simpson shannon and sørensen biodiversity indices were calculated according to hill et al 24 and chao et al 25 the nucleotide sequences have been deposited in genebank under the accession numbers mw082835 mw084339 2 6 multivariate statics analysis the statistical differences of the different abiotic and biotic data sets among the samples were analysed using non parametric tests p 0 05 significance level in xlstat v2020 addinsoft new york usa the pc ord software 26 was used for the multivariate statistical analyses to determine the differences in the biotic variables abundances of bacterial groups measured by pcr or relative abundance ra of the different otus were relativized by the maximum before the construction of non parametric multidimensional scaling nms analyses according to the corresponding sørensen dissimilarity matrices the abiotic data sets logarithmic transformed were coupled into the nms in order to obtain the correlations among the ordination of samples and the physicochemical parameters of the different wwtps 3 results and discussion 3 1 samples characterization ww and as characterizations are shown in table 1 in general there was a high variability of the composition of the effluents from the 4 fish canning factories in this sense the nacl concentrations of the wws were low in f1 and f3 nacl influent concentrations 0 78 and 0 83 g l respectively moderate in f2 nacl concentration 1 66 g l and high in f4 nacl concentration 14 90 g l the toc concentrations were moderate in f1 f2 and f3 toc influent concentrations 0 49 0 26 and 0 36 g l respectively however f4 bore the highest organic load toc 1 97 g l similarly the n pollution was moderated in f1 and f4 nh4 influent concentrations ranging 13 36 37 36 mg n nh4 l and higher for f2 and f3 nh4 influent concentrations ranging 150 175 mg n nh4 l despite these differences in the salt concentration organic and n loads the removal efficiencies fulfilled the eu discharge standards 27 in the four facilities 3 2 quantification of bacterial archaeal and fungal populations quantitative qpcr was used to assess the abundance of bacteria archaea and fungi and the results were summarized in fig 1 according to the kruskal wallis and conover iman tests there were significant differences among the 4 wwtps for all genes quantified the total bacterial populations were in the range of 6 59 1013 4 81 1012 gene copies l as the highest copy numbers were found in the f1 facility intermediate values were measured in f2 and f3 with no statistical differences between both facilities and the lowest values in f4 the facility with the highest nacl concentration the abundance of total bacterial populations is a general marker of the ww treatment process in which a wide range of contaminant organic compounds are mineralized by bacteria to water and carbon dioxide 28 despite the statistical differences among wwtps the bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers were up to three orders of magnitude higher than those previously described by layton et al 29 and shu et al 30 in an industrial wwtp treating different chemically enriched wws and a municipal wwtp respectively however similar values were found by other authors in different sewage sludges 31 32 recently abzazou et al 33 proposed that higher abundances of bacteria in the as of wwtp results in better nutrient removal efficiencies regardless of the sample the absolute abundances of archaea were lower than those of bacteria and shifted over 4 orders of magnitude from 2 22 109 in f3 to 7 26 104 gene copies l as in f2 the main role of archaeal populations in wwtps is to perform the final steps of the mineralization of the organic matter 34 abzazou et al 33 found higher abundances of total archaea than those here described when they analysed the structure of microbial communities in municipal wwtps the abundance of total fungi was lower compared to the two prokaryotic domains and was higher in the f1 samples 4 36 107 1 77 107 gene copies l as with no differences among the other 3 facilities 2 05 106 1 75 105 gene copies l as fungal populations are involved in several processes in wwtps such as organic matter biodegradation the establishment of sludge flocs and detoxification 35 the abundance of fungal markers fell within the same range previously reported by maza márquez et al 36 in different municipal wwtps but with a lower 18s rrna bacterial 16s rrna ratio than that described by wei et al 37 however it must be also taken into consideration that the quantification of fungi may differ depending on the selected gene markers and primers 36 3 3 quantification of key groups involved in ww treatment the abundances of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers mycolata and microthrix accumulibacter and competibacter were also determined by qpcr fig 1 the abundance of bacterial amoa genes greatly varied among samples of the different facilities being lower in f1 2 21 104 3 96 103 gene copies l as and f2 3 29 104 1 23 104 gene copies l as intermediate in f3 4 92 105 4 61 105 gene copies l as and higher in f4 1 10 106 7 00 105 gene copies l as the amoa bearing bacteria are exploited to reduce the ammonia concentration of the effluents in wwtps in which they are primarily responsible for the initial step of nitrification converting ammonia to nitrite 29 the aob population abundances were reduced in these fish canning wwtps compared to those found in other municipal wwtps 38 39 on the other hand despite several attempts to amplify the aoa counterpart populations they were more often below the detection limit indicating that they would be hardly involved in nitrification in the analysed wwtps the lack of detection of aoa was in agreement with several previous works that have described a low aoa aob ratio in different wwtps 39 40 recently gwak et al 41 have proposed that the high level of complex mixtures of organic compounds that typically occurs in ww specifically inhibits the growth of aoa without affecting aob subsequently data of ammonia oxidizing archaea were removed from analysis henceforth microthrix actinobacteria populations were less abundant in f1 and f2 samples 4 80 109 and 6 76 109 respectively compared to those from f3 and f4 2 21 1010 and 1 82 1010 respectively on the other hand the 16s rrna copy numbers of mycolata a group of filamentous actinobacteria that contain mycolic acids in their cell wall particularly gordonia millisia mycobacterium nocardia skermania and tsukamurella 42 43 oscillated from 5 10 108 to 9 05 1010 gene copies l as measured in the f3 and f1 facilities respectively filamentous bacteria are essential for the treatment of ww as they provide the structural inner backbone necessary to form flocs or granules in as 44 however an excessive proliferation of filamentous bacterial groups is often related to severe bulking and or foaming 45 it is noteworthy that at the sampling time the f1 wwtp experimented an isolated episode of bulking taking into account that the microthrix mycolata ratio was 1 in the f1 facility the dominance of microthrix over other filamentous bacteria could be related to the observed bulking phenomenon nonetheless the gene copy numbers of both microthrix and mycolata measured here were within the ranges previously found in different wwtps 19 20 46 47 the abundance of accumulibacter was higher in f1 1 97 108 copy numbers l of as followed by f4 1 11 107 copies l as and finally f2 and f3 with no statistical differences among them 1 94 105 and 2 18 105 copies l as respectively a similar trend was observed for competibacter 1 02 109 3 26 108 6 54 107 and 6 54 107 copies l as f1 f4 f2 and f3 respectively accumulibacter is one of the main microorganisms capable of polyphosphate accumulation to remove phosphorus p from wastewater while gaos are often viewed as pao competitors as they consume carbon substrate without p removal 48 49 although both candidate genera are generally associated to enhanced biological p removal ebpr systems 50 they were found worldwide in wwtps that do not operate under ebpr conditions 51 interestingly pao and gao populations followed the same tendencies in the 4 wwtps suggesting that they were modulated by the same factors compared to other works the abundances of both populations were lower than previously reported in ebpr systems 52 53 but similar to those observed in a sbr not configured for p removal 54 the domination of gao populations over pao suggests that p removal due to accumulibacter activity in these as was minimal there were no statistical differences for the absolute abundances of total fungi mycolata pao and gao between the cas and nrr systems according to the mann whitney test fig 1 suggesting that the type of configuration of the fish canning facilities did not have an strong effect over these populations the copy numbers of total bacteria were higher in the cas systems while total archaea aob and microthrix populations were higher in the nrr systems specifically designed for nitrogen removal nitrification and denitrification besides there is to note that the highest abundance of archaea in the nrr compared to the cas systems could be linked to the use of an anaerobic digester previous to the nrr in which different archaeal groups perform key processes 55 therefore the type of configuration was a factor that only modulated the abundance of some microbial groups in agreement with that baek et al 56 found slight divergences in the gene copy numbers of total bacteria and of some functional populations in different industrial wwtps finally to take into consideration the differences in vss concentration among the different facilities the absolute abundances of the targeted bacterial populations were also expressed as the number of gene copies g vss table s2 generally considered the values followed the same trends for the different populations and facilities than when the total abundances were standardized per liter of

of otus per amplicon library was 367 27 there were no statistical differences in the numbers of otus among the samples although there were differences in both biodiversity indices the highest values of the shannon index and reciprocally the lowest of the simpson index were observed for the f2 samples suggesting that the bacterial community in this facility was more diverse and was distributed more evenly than those of the other wwtps according to marzorati et al 57 communities displaying high diversity and evenness have a low functional organization and respond better to changing environmental conditions maintaining their functionality neither the type of treatment nor the nacl gradient produced significant changes in the values of the biodiversity indices which fell within the same ranges previously reported in urban 58 and industrial food processing wwtps 59 the total number of high quality sequences was 91 817 and the average number per library was 11 477 1891

without drastic changes between samples 0 61 0 73 table s8 however the beta diversity calculated in terms of abundance showed stronger differences among the number of individuals of the shared otus table s8 being higher for f1 and f2 1 08 f2 and f4 0 97 and f3 and f4 0 98 than for the other pairwise comparisons 0 49 0 52 therefore a higher level of homology could not be linked either to the type of configuration or the nacl gradient the incidence based sørensen index was high for the pairwise comparisons without drastic changes between samples 0 61 0 73 table s8 however the beta diversity

the bacterial community composition among samples a hierarchical cluster analysis based on the bray curtis similarity matrix was performed fig s3 this analysis found a greatest level of homology between samples f2 and f3 followed by f1 and finally by f4 therefore the cluster analysis confirmed that the specific characteristics of each industrial ww and the operational parameters were more important drivers of community shaping than the type of configuration this result is in agreement with ibarbalz et al 99 and isazadeh et al 100 who have previously suggested that bacterial compositions in both urban and industrial wwtps are more drastically affected by the individual intrinsic characteristics of wwtps than by the type of configuration finally to visualize the global

parameters and microbial community structure in fish canning wwtps nonmetric multidimensional scaling nms analyses a kind of non constrained ordination were conducted taking into account the absolute abundance of key microbial populations qpcr data and the ra of the dominant otus derived from the illumina sequencing analyses the characteristics of the ww and as and the operational parameters were linked to the corresponding nms analyses aiming to go deeper into the existing relationships between the microbial community structure and those abiotic variables as demonstrated in fig 4 the different microbial populations measured by qpcr were divided in two clusters cluster 1 comprising total bacteria and fungi gao pao and mycolata and cluster 2 which grouped together total archaea aob and microthrix the samples from the 4 wwtps were distributed differently in the nms space f1 and f3 were strongly influenced by cluster 1 and cluster 2 populations abundances respectively while f2 was not highly influenced by the microbial populations and f4 located intermediately between f2 and f3 therefore the ordination of the samples was independent of the type of configuration the vectors representing the trends of the operational parameters with a magnitude r2 0 5 were overlapped on the nms plots fig 4 pairwise pearson product moment r correlations with the trends of the microbial copy numbers and those of all the abiotic parameters were calculated table s9 only strong correlations r 0 7 r 0 7 will be discussed below as demonstrated in fig 4 the different microbial populations

the same parameters ww ph ww nh4 and as nacl while the abundance of archaea was linked to different factors ww vfa and as ph suggesting an ecotype differentiation among archaea and the other two broad groups of microbes the abundance of gene markers of archaea was not significantly related to salinity table s9 in agreement with the previous knowledge of microorganisms of this domain being able to endure wide salinity fluctuations and achieve stable community structures faster than bacteria in nature 101 according to table s9 absolute abundances of both bacteria and fungi correlated negatively

broad groups of microbes the abundance of gene markers of archaea was not significantly related to salinity table s9 in agreement with the previous knowledge of microorganisms of this domain being able to endure wide salinity fluctuations and achieve stable community structures faster than bacteria in nature 101 the absolute abundances of aob were strongly correlated with as nacl accordingly pan et al 102 previously stated that the numbers of copies of amoa genes of aob in a municipal full scale cas were significantly higher at 2 5 10 g l nacl compared to salt free conditions while counts were lower at 15 g l nacl or higher in contrast no differences of the number of copies of aob amoa genes were observed at either 10 or 30 g l nacl in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor treating saline industrial ww 103 the negative effects of salinity on ammonia oxidation rates at nacl concentrations falling within the range of those in the facilities analysed here have been reported in an aerobic anoxic nitrifying sequencing batch reactor and a municipal full scale cas 102 103 the tolerance of aob to salinity widely varies depending on the species 104 hence nacl concentration may influence nitrification performance by shifting the aob community structure in this sense cortés lorenzo et al 105 observed no detrimental effects on nitrification in an aerated anoxic submerged biofilter when it was fed with municipal ww at 0 or 3 7 g l nacl while ammonia oxidation activity was significantly hampered at nacl concentrations 24 g l and the change in efficiency was concomitant with population succession leading to a higher relative abundance of aob phylotypes mostly described in saline environments pao and gao populations abundance were both negatively correlated to the variables ww ph ww nh4 and as nacl which followed very similar trends throughout the samples ordination fig 4 in this regard wang et al 106 have previously stated that concentrations 10 g l nacl inhibited accumulibacter s phosphate accumulation efficiency in batch tests while mielczarek et al 107 failed to find significant correlations among ww nh4 and accumulibacter or competibacter abundance in a survey conducted on 28 full scale municipal ebpr plants in denmark lopez vazquez et al 108 highlighted that the differences in physicochemical properties i e ph or temperature of the as have the same effect over pao and gao populations indicating that they both respond in the same manner when exposed to similar environmental conditions also it is important to note that the same niche selection makes the inhibition of the non desired gao over the beneficial pao populations difficult the abundance of gene markers of mycolata and microthrix was driven by different variables despite their belonging to the same phylum highlighting a divergence in the colonization traits between both lineages of filamentous bacteria mycolata populations abundance was strongly and negatively correlated with ww ph ww nh4 and as nacl while in the case of microthrix robust links were only detected with increasing values of ww vfa and as nacl and decreasing values of ww nh4 fig 4 table s9 strong negative correlations were previously reported among the absolute abundances of mycolata and ww ph and those of microthrix and as nh4 in studies conducted in full scale municipal wwtps 19 20 in contrast jiang et al 109 failed to find robust correlations among ww nh4 and the abundances of mycolata microthrix and other filamentous bacteria in a full scale wwtp monitored during 5 years salinity is well known as a factor inhibiting the growth of filamentous bacteria in as 110 and previous studies specifically reported a low tolerance of microthrix to nacl 103 111 thus the positive correlation observed here between the as nacl and the absolute abundance of microthrix was unexpected table s9 the abundance of gene markers of mycolata and microthrix was driven by different variables despite their belonging

physiologically different 112 the results presented here suggest that both aob and microthrix were more halotolerant than the other bacterial groups targeted by qpcr in the four fish canning wwt facilities table s9 however contradictory reports in the literature exist which highlight the need of further research to fully understand the effects of nacl over the dominance patterns of microthrix aob pao and gao populations in wwtps receiving saline influents the detrimental effects of nacl are well described in groups of bacterial populations evolutionarily and eco physiologically different 112 the results presented here suggest that both aob and microthrix were more halotolerant than the other bacterial groups targeted by qpcr in the four fish canning wwt facilities table s9 however contradictory reports in the literature exist which highlight the need of further research to fully understand the effects of nacl over the dominance patterns of microthrix aob pao and gao populations in wwtps receiving saline influents similarly to the trends observed in fig 4 the nms based on the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial otus characterized by illumina sequencing fig 5 demonstrated that the samples were distributed across the whole nms space without following any clear pattern of ordination the substantial divergence in the structure of the bacterial communities is in disagreement with the previously described results for the eukaryotic communities in the same wwtps samples which were more narrowly distributed in their corresponding nms 15 therefore the particular characteristics of fish canning effluents and operational parameters inflicted a narrower selection of the eukaryotic populations that participate in the wwtp functionality than that observed for the bacterial communities this suggests a redundant functionality in the bacterial community since different bacterial taxa can carry out the same roles in the wwtps according to the statistical analyses here employed nms plot fig 5 table s10 ww nacl was the main factor that influenced the distribution of the samples along axis 1 which explained 52 of the total variance suggesting that this variable specifically modulated the structure of the dominant otus found in the 4 fish canning wwtps despite the influence of other factors this result is supported by previous literature which highlighted the role of nacl concentration as a major factor influencing as community structure and wwtp performance 15 64 74 in addition to that other individual factors and in lesser degree the type of configuration were also involved in the assembly of the microbial communities of each wwtp in this sense the trends of ww nh4 and as vss influenced in opposite ways the bacterial community structures of both f1 and f2 facilities similarly the bacterial community structures of f3 and f4 facilities diverged mostly due to the differences of both ww nacl and as nacl although ww toc was also a very influential factor in this sense the capacity of these variables to modulate the structure of bacterial communities in wwtp has been previously and amply described in different scientific works

113 115 the otus displaying the higher or lower values of the pearson s correlation coefficient r with the concentration of nacl r 0 99 or 0 99 are shown in table 2 those otus whose ras were most positively correlated to nacl concentration could be addressed as salt tolerant and or halophilic bacteria which could perform the former functions of the halophobic bacteria in as of wwtps operated under high nacl content there is to note that the otus here considered salt tolerant halophilic were distributed among different phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi gemmatimonadetes and proteobacteria and the group of bacteria unclassified among the different mechanisms to cope with salt stress the increase of osmolytes and the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes have been described in different members of actinobacteria 116 and chloroflexi 117 and the presence of an acidic proteome has been proposed as the main adaptation to nacl stress in bacteroidetes 118 and proteobacteria 119 although some authors 120 have recently proposed gemmatimonadetes as halophilic or halotolerant bacteria the mechanisms involved in their nacl adaptation are not yet established on the other hand some genera belonging to the phylum planctomycetes have been described as well adapted to high salinity conditions in some industrial wwtps such as those from textile industries 67 however in the current work the ras of otus taxonomically affiliated to phylum planctomycetes within the total community were very low indicating that they most probably lacked important roles in these wwtps although this work was pioneer in the analysis of the nacl effect on the bacterial community in fish canning wwtps further research is needed to unravel the importance of nacl for the shaping of microbial communities in saline influents of either fish canning or other industrial wwtps in order to address their contribution to the adequate management of these saline effluents according the data here showed future studies building on the results here presented could also aim at the identification of the key players in the microbial community necessary for an optimal treatment of the industrial fish canning effluents 4 conclusion the results presented here showed that high nacl concentrations exerted a negative pressure over the absolute abundances of total bacteria and fungi mycolata paos and gaos in the as of four full scale fish canning wwtps however it was not a barrier for the proliferation of aob populations higher nacl concentrations correlated positively with an increased relative abundance of otus belonging to the phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi gemmatimonadetes and proteobacteria the bacterial communities structures were highly different among the 4 analysed wwtps indicating a strong modulating effect of the particular ww characteristics and the operational parameters of each facility rather than the type of configuration these findings provide

13247,studies that characterize the microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants wwtps are numerous yet similar studies in industrial wwtps treating fish canning effluents are limited the microbial communities in samples of 4 fish canning wwtps that operated under different nacl concentrations were investigated by qpcr and partial 16s rrna gene illumina sequencing the absolute abundances of key microbial populations total bacteria archaea and fungi ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob mycolata candidatus microthrix ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter presented statistical differences among the wwtps the nacl concentration negatively affected the absolute abundance of bacteria and fungi filamentous and phosphate pao and glycogen gao accumulating bacteria while aob and ca microthrix populations were statistically higher in the wwtp with higher nacl contents on the other hand the main bacterial operational taxonomic units otus were classified as members of kouleothrix chloroflexia chloroflexi and tetrasphaera actinomycetia actinobacteria family beijerinckiaceae alphaproteobacteria proteobacteria order betaproteobacteriales gammaproteobacteria proteobacteria sphingobacteriales sphingobacteriia bacteroidetes and frankiales actinobacteria actinobacteria class anaerolineae chloroflexi phylum chloroflexi and bacteria unclassified the structure of the bacterial community was highly dissimilar among the 4 wwtps as the identities of the dominant otus differed significantly among them therefore the individual characteristics of the different wwtps mainly nacl concentration were responsible for the narrow assemblage of the bacterial communities different otus belonging to the phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi gemmatimonadetes and proteobacteria were revealed as salt tolerant taking into account these results nacl content was an important driver of the abundance of microbial populations and the bacterial community structure in the analysed industrial facilities graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fish canning wwtp qpcr bacterial diversity halophilic bacteria 1 introduction in the last 30 years the total per capita consumption of fish and seafood has increased globally by 50 1 this is due to the consumer s perception that fish is a healthy alternative to other protein sources 2 to meet this demand processed fish production has been increased with a rapid growth of fish preserving and fish canning industries across the world 3 4 biological wastewater ww treatment depends mainly on the structure and function of the microbial communities that carry out the transformation of contaminants and removal of nutrients 5 effective ww treatment is necessary to avoid environmental damage after the discharge of effluents into natural water streams the abundance and diversity of the activated sludge as bacterial biomass determines the metabolic pathways that occur in the ww treatment plant wwtp that finally dictate the quality of the treated effluent different operational and environmental parameters influence the abundance of key microbial populations and regulate the assembly of the complex bacterial communities of the as 6 7 fish canning industries consume large quantities of water that are utilized in different stages of fish processing generating high amounts of ww 8 9 in general treatment of industrial ww is often much more difficult than that of urban wastewater 10 particularly fish canning wws are characterized by a high salt content and high loads of organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and fat 8 high salt concentration in wwtps results in osmotic stress causing disintegration of cells by reducing cell turgor and dehydrating cytoplasm 11 consequently a nacl increase can negatively impact on the treatment processes of these ww as biological activity can decrease if salinity raises in addition high chemical oxygen demand cod and particulate matter concentration usually hinders fish canning ww treatment due to these inconveniences these effluents can cause drastic effects on the environment if not properly managed and disposed of to cope with these problems different types of ww treatment systems have been tested 12 13 however a large knowledge gap still exists it is unclear whether microbial populations abundance and community assemblages are affected by the salinity and strength of fish canning ww furthermore the understanding of the relationships between the microbial communities and the operational environmental parameters of full scale industrial wwtps is limited therefore answers to these questions represent a challenge in the field of environmental engineering 6 14 this study investigated microbial communities structure in the as of 4 different wwtps that receive influents from fish canning industries differing in their nacl content in order to address the following questions 1 were there significant differences in the abundances of key microbial populations and the bacterial community structures among facilities 2 is there a common bacterial core among the different wwtps 3 what were the relationships between microbial populations abundances and operational variables 4 was the nacl content an important driver of the shaping of bacterial communities structure and 5 which were the halophilic halophobic bacteria of the as therefore the information collected in this study will contribute to the characterization and understanding of the microbial community structure and ecology in fish canning wwtps in addition due to the limited scientific literature addressing the effect of nacl on the bacterial diversity in this particular type of industrial facilities the assignation of the potential roles of the dominant otus found in the current work will help to understand the biological treatment of other highly saline effluents 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling ww and as from four different fish

intermittently aerated and 1 fully aerated compartments the nrrs f4 treated high salinity ww most of which was pumped directly into an anaerobic reactor for organic matter valorization into biogas the remaining ww was bypassed to a nrr where it was mixed with the anaerobic digestor effluent this last unit the nrr was a nitrifying denitrifying sequencing batch reactor sbr operated in cycles feeding aeration settling and withdrawal where the organic matter present in the ww supported the denitrification of the oxidized ammonia into gas nitrogen the as samples were taken from the biological

v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was performed using the prokaryotic specific primers pro341f 5 cctacgggnbgcascag 3 and pro805r 5 gactacnvgggtatctaatcc 3 modified by takahashi et al 21 raw data from illumina miseq sequencing were processed using the mothurmiseq guidelines in the software mothur v1 44 1 22 the different first and reverse fastq read files were combined to generate the individual files quality control primer trimming and filtering were made according to the default settings improved sequences were merged into unique sequences that were aligned against the silva seed v132 database aligned sequences were subjected to a de noise analysis three difference mismatches and putative chimeric sequences were detected and removed using the vsearch tool pairwise distances between aligned dna sequences were conducted for the remaining unique sequences and operational taxonomic units otus were defined according to their phylogeny distance 97 similarity otus with an abundance of only 1 sequence read in the whole set were considered pcr artifacts and were removed for diversity analysis the consensus sequence of the different otus was obtained through the get oturep command finally each consensus sequence was taxonomically classified using the silva seed v132 database that follows the whole genome taxonomy recently proposed by parks et al 23 rarefaction curves for the otus abundance data were constructed using the analytic rarefaction software university of georgia athens usa https strata uga edu software simpson shannon and sørensen biodiversity indices were calculated according to hill et al 24 and chao et al 25 the nucleotide sequences have been deposited in genebank under the accession numbers mw082835 mw084339 2 6 multivariate statics analysis the statistical differences of the different abiotic and biotic data sets among the samples were analysed using non parametric tests p 0 05 significance level in xlstat v2020 addinsoft new york usa the pc ord software 26 was used for the multivariate statistical analyses to determine the differences in the biotic variables abundances of bacterial groups measured by pcr or relative abundance ra of the different otus were relativized by the maximum before the construction of non parametric multidimensional scaling nms analyses according to the corresponding sørensen dissimilarity matrices the abiotic data sets logarithmic transformed were coupled into the nms in order to obtain the correlations among the ordination of samples and the physicochemical parameters of the different wwtps 3 results and discussion 3 1 samples characterization ww and as characterizations are shown in table 1 in general there was a high variability of the composition of the effluents from the 4 fish canning factories in this sense the nacl concentrations of the wws were low in f1 and f3 nacl influent concentrations 0 78 and 0 83 g l respectively moderate in f2 nacl concentration 1 66 g l and high in f4 nacl concentration 14 90 g l the toc concentrations were moderate in f1 f2 and f3 toc influent concentrations 0 49 0 26 and 0 36 g l respectively however f4 bore the highest organic load toc 1 97 g l similarly the n pollution was moderated in f1 and f4 nh4 influent concentrations ranging 13 36 37 36 mg n nh4 l and higher for f2 and f3 nh4 influent concentrations ranging 150 175 mg n nh4 l despite these differences in the salt concentration organic and n loads the removal efficiencies fulfilled the eu discharge standards 27 in the four facilities 3 2 quantification of bacterial archaeal and fungal populations quantitative qpcr was used to assess the abundance of bacteria archaea and fungi and the results were summarized in fig 1 according to the kruskal wallis and conover iman tests there were significant differences among the 4 wwtps for all genes quantified the total bacterial populations were in the range of 6 59 1013 4 81 1012 gene copies l as the highest copy numbers were found in the f1 facility intermediate values were measured in f2 and f3 with no statistical differences between both facilities and the lowest values in f4 the facility with the highest nacl concentration the abundance of total bacterial populations is a general marker of the ww treatment process in which a wide range of contaminant organic compounds are mineralized by bacteria to water and carbon dioxide 28 despite the statistical differences among wwtps the bacterial 16s rrna gene copy numbers were up to three orders of magnitude higher than those previously described by layton et al 29 and shu et al 30 in an industrial wwtp treating different chemically enriched wws and a municipal wwtp respectively however similar values were found by other authors in different sewage sludges 31 32 recently abzazou et al 33 proposed that higher abundances of bacteria in the as of wwtp results in better nutrient removal efficiencies regardless of the sample the absolute abundances of archaea were lower than those of bacteria and shifted over 4 orders of magnitude from 2 22 109 in f3 to 7 26 104 gene copies l as in f2 the main role of archaeal populations in wwtps is to perform the final steps of the mineralization of the organic matter 34 abzazou et al 33 found higher abundances of total archaea than those here described when they analysed the structure of microbial communities in municipal wwtps the abundance of total fungi was lower compared to the two prokaryotic domains and was higher in the f1 samples 4 36 107 1 77 107 gene copies l as with no differences among the other 3 facilities 2 05 106 1 75 105 gene copies l as fungal populations are involved in several processes in wwtps such as organic matter biodegradation the establishment of sludge flocs and detoxification 35 the abundance of fungal markers fell within the same range previously reported by maza márquez et al 36 in different municipal wwtps but with a lower 18s rrna bacterial 16s rrna ratio than that described by wei et al 37 however it must be also taken into consideration that the quantification of fungi may differ depending on the selected gene markers and primers 36 3 3 quantification of key groups involved in ww treatment the abundances of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers mycolata and microthrix accumulibacter and competibacter were also determined by qpcr fig 1 the abundance of bacterial amoa genes greatly varied among samples of the different facilities being lower in f1 2 21 104 3 96 103 gene copies l as and f2 3 29 104 1 23 104 gene copies l as intermediate in f3 4 92 105 4 61 105 gene copies l as and higher in f4 1 10 106 7 00 105 gene copies l as the amoa bearing bacteria are exploited to reduce the ammonia concentration of the effluents in wwtps in which they are primarily responsible for the initial step of nitrification converting ammonia to nitrite 29 the aob population abundances were reduced in these fish canning wwtps compared to those found in other municipal wwtps 38 39 on the other hand despite several attempts to amplify the aoa counterpart populations they were more often below the detection limit indicating that they would be hardly involved in nitrification in the analysed wwtps the lack of detection of aoa was in agreement with several previous works that have described a low aoa aob ratio in different wwtps 39 40 recently gwak et al 41 have proposed that the high level of complex mixtures of organic compounds that typically occurs in ww specifically inhibits the growth of aoa without affecting aob subsequently data of ammonia oxidizing archaea were removed from analysis henceforth microthrix actinobacteria populations were less abundant in f1 and f2 samples 4 80 109 and 6 76 109 respectively compared to those from f3 and f4 2 21 1010 and 1 82 1010 respectively on the other hand the 16s rrna copy numbers of mycolata a group of filamentous actinobacteria that contain mycolic acids in their cell wall particularly gordonia millisia mycobacterium nocardia skermania and tsukamurella 42 43 oscillated from 5 10 108 to 9 05 1010 gene copies l as measured in the f3 and f1 facilities respectively filamentous bacteria are essential for the treatment of ww as they provide the structural inner backbone necessary to form flocs or granules in as 44 however an excessive proliferation of filamentous bacterial groups is often related to severe bulking and or foaming 45 it is noteworthy that at the sampling time the f1 wwtp experimented an isolated episode of bulking taking into account that the microthrix mycolata ratio was 1 in the f1 facility the dominance of microthrix over other filamentous bacteria could be related to the observed bulking phenomenon nonetheless the gene copy numbers of both microthrix and mycolata measured here were within the ranges previously found in different wwtps 19 20 46 47 the abundance of accumulibacter was higher in f1 1 97 108 copy numbers l of as followed by f4 1 11 107 copies l as and finally f2 and f3 with no statistical differences among them 1 94 105 and 2 18 105 copies l as respectively a similar trend was observed for competibacter 1 02 109 3 26 108 6 54 107 and 6 54 107 copies l as f1 f4 f2 and f3 respectively accumulibacter is one of the main microorganisms capable of polyphosphate accumulation to remove phosphorus p from wastewater while gaos are often viewed as pao competitors as they consume carbon substrate without p removal 48 49 although both candidate genera are generally associated to enhanced biological p removal ebpr systems 50 they were found worldwide in wwtps that do not operate under ebpr conditions 51 interestingly pao and gao populations followed the same tendencies in the 4 wwtps suggesting that they were modulated by the same factors compared to other works the abundances of both populations were lower than previously reported in ebpr systems 52 53 but similar to those observed in a sbr not configured for p removal 54 the domination of gao populations over pao suggests that p removal due to accumulibacter activity in these as was minimal there were no statistical differences for the absolute abundances of total fungi mycolata pao and gao between the cas and nrr systems according to the mann whitney test fig 1 suggesting that the type of configuration of the fish canning facilities did not have an strong effect over these populations the copy numbers of total bacteria were higher in the cas systems while total archaea aob and microthrix populations were higher in the nrr systems specifically designed for nitrogen removal nitrification and denitrification besides there is to note that the highest abundance of archaea in the nrr compared to the cas systems could be linked to the use of an anaerobic digester previous to the nrr in which different archaeal groups perform key processes 55 therefore the type of configuration was a factor that only modulated the abundance of some microbial groups in agreement with that baek et al 56 found slight divergences in the gene copy numbers of total bacteria and of some functional populations in different industrial wwtps finally to take into consideration the differences in vss concentration among the different facilities the absolute abundances of the targeted bacterial populations were also expressed as the number of gene copies g vss table s2 generally considered the values followed the same trends for the different populations and facilities than when the total abundances were standardized per liter of

of the shannon index and reciprocally the lowest of the simpson index were observed for the f2 samples suggesting that the bacterial community in this facility was more diverse and was distributed more evenly than those of the other wwtps according to marzorati et al 57 communities displaying high diversity and evenness have a low functional organization and respond better to changing environmental conditions maintaining their functionality neither the type of treatment nor the nacl gradient produced significant changes in the values of the biodiversity indices which fell within the same ranges previously reported in urban 58 and industrial food processing wwtps 59 the total number of high quality sequences was 91 817 and the average number per library was 11 477 1891

table s8 being higher for f1 and f2 1 08 f2 and f4 0 97 and f3 and f4 0 98 than for the other pairwise comparisons 0 49 0 52 therefore a higher level of homology could not be linked either to the type

the bacterial community composition among samples a hierarchical cluster analysis based on the bray curtis similarity matrix was performed fig s3 this analysis found a greatest level of homology between samples f2 and f3 followed by f1 and finally by f4 therefore the cluster analysis confirmed that the specific characteristics of each industrial ww and the operational parameters were more important drivers of community shaping than the type of configuration this result is in agreement with ibarbalz et al 99 and isazadeh et al 100 who have previously suggested that bacterial compositions in both urban and industrial wwtps are more drastically affected by the individual intrinsic characteristics of wwtps than by the type of configuration finally to visualize the global

parameters and microbial community structure in fish canning wwtps nonmetric multidimensional scaling nms analyses a kind of non constrained ordination were conducted taking into account the absolute abundance of key microbial populations qpcr data and the ra of the dominant otus derived from the illumina sequencing analyses the characteristics of the ww and as and the operational parameters were linked to the corresponding nms analyses aiming to go deeper into the existing relationships between the microbial community structure and those abiotic variables as demonstrated in fig 4 the different microbial populations measured by qpcr were divided in two clusters cluster 1 comprising total bacteria and fungi gao pao and mycolata and cluster 2 which grouped together total archaea aob and microthrix the samples from the 4 wwtps were distributed differently in the nms space f1 and f3 were strongly influenced by cluster 1 and cluster 2 populations abundances respectively while f2 was not highly influenced by the microbial populations and f4 located intermediately between f2 and f3 therefore the ordination of the samples was independent of the type of configuration the vectors representing the trends of the operational parameters with a magnitude r2 0 5 were overlapped on the nms plots fig 4 pairwise pearson product moment r correlations with the trends of the microbial copy numbers and those of all the abiotic parameters were calculated table s9 only strong correlations r 0 7 r 0 7 will be discussed below as demonstrated in fig 4 the different microbial populations

the same parameters ww ph ww nh4 and as nacl while the abundance of archaea was linked to different factors ww vfa and as ph suggesting an ecotype differentiation among archaea and the other two broad groups of microbes the abundance of gene markers of archaea was not significantly related to salinity table s9 in agreement with the previous knowledge of microorganisms of this domain being able to endure wide salinity fluctuations and achieve stable community structures faster than bacteria in nature 101 according to table s9 absolute abundances of both bacteria and fungi correlated negatively with the same parameters ww ph ww nh4 and as nacl while the abundance of archaea was linked to different factors ww vfa and as ph suggesting an ecotype differentiation among archaea and the other two broad groups of microbes the abundance of gene markers of archaea was not significantly related to salinity table s9 in agreement with the previous knowledge of microorganisms of this domain being able to endure wide salinity fluctuations and achieve stable community structures faster than bacteria in nature 101 the absolute abundances of aob were strongly correlated with as nacl accordingly pan et al 102 previously stated that the numbers of copies of amoa genes of aob in a municipal full scale cas were significantly higher at 2 5 10 g l nacl compared to salt free conditions while counts were lower at 15 g l nacl or higher in contrast no differences of the number of copies of aob amoa genes were observed at either 10 or 30 g l nacl in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor treating saline industrial ww 103 the negative effects of salinity on ammonia oxidation rates at nacl concentrations falling within the range of those in the facilities analysed here have been reported in an aerobic anoxic nitrifying sequencing batch reactor and a municipal full scale cas 102 103 the tolerance of aob to salinity widely varies depending on the species 104 hence nacl concentration may influence nitrification performance by shifting the aob community structure in this sense cortés lorenzo et al 105 observed no detrimental effects on nitrification in an aerated anoxic submerged biofilter when it was fed with municipal ww at 0 or 3 7 g l nacl while ammonia oxidation activity was significantly hampered at nacl concentrations 24 g l and the change in efficiency was concomitant with population succession leading to a higher relative abundance of aob phylotypes mostly described in saline environments pao and gao populations abundance were both negatively correlated to the variables ww ph ww nh4 and as nacl which followed very similar trends throughout the samples ordination fig 4 in this regard wang et al 106 have previously stated that concentrations 10 g l nacl inhibited accumulibacter s phosphate accumulation efficiency in batch tests while mielczarek et al 107 failed to find significant correlations among ww nh4 and accumulibacter or competibacter abundance in a survey conducted on 28 full scale municipal ebpr plants in denmark lopez vazquez et al 108 highlighted that the differences in physicochemical properties i e ph or temperature of the as have the same effect over pao and gao populations indicating that they both respond in the same manner when exposed to similar environmental conditions also it is important to note that the same niche selection makes the inhibition of the non desired gao over the beneficial pao populations difficult the abundance of gene markers of mycolata and microthrix was driven by different variables despite their belonging to the same phylum highlighting a divergence in the colonization traits between both lineages of filamentous bacteria mycolata populations abundance was strongly and negatively correlated with ww ph ww nh4 and as nacl while in the case of microthrix robust links were only detected with increasing values of ww vfa and as nacl and decreasing values of ww nh4 fig 4 table s9 strong negative correlations were previously reported among the absolute abundances of mycolata and ww ph and those of microthrix and as nh4 in studies conducted in full scale municipal wwtps 19 20 in contrast jiang et al 109 failed to find robust correlations among ww nh4 and the abundances of mycolata microthrix and other filamentous bacteria in a full scale wwtp monitored during 5 years salinity is well known as a factor inhibiting the growth of filamentous bacteria in as 110 and previous studies specifically reported a low tolerance of microthrix to nacl 103 111 thus the positive correlation observed here between the as nacl and the absolute abundance of microthrix was unexpected table s9 the abundance of gene markers of mycolata and microthrix was driven by different variables despite their belonging

between the as nacl and the absolute abundance of microthrix was unexpected table s9 the detrimental effects of nacl are well described in groups of bacterial populations evolutionarily and eco physiologically different 112 the results presented here suggest that both aob and microthrix were more halotolerant than the other bacterial groups targeted by qpcr in the four fish canning wwt facilities table s9 however contradictory reports in the literature exist which highlight the need of further research to fully understand the effects of nacl over the dominance patterns of microthrix aob pao and gao populations in wwtps receiving saline influents the detrimental effects of nacl are well described in groups of bacterial populations evolutionarily and eco physiologically different 112 the results presented here suggest that both aob and microthrix were more halotolerant than the other bacterial groups targeted by qpcr in the four fish canning wwt facilities table s9 however contradictory reports in the literature exist which highlight the need of further research to fully understand the effects of nacl over the dominance patterns of microthrix aob pao and gao populations in wwtps receiving saline influents similarly to the trends observed in fig 4 the nms based on the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial otus characterized by illumina sequencing fig 5 demonstrated that the samples were distributed across the whole nms space without following any clear pattern of ordination the substantial divergence in the structure of the bacterial communities is in disagreement with the previously described results for the eukaryotic communities in the same wwtps samples which were more narrowly distributed in their corresponding nms 15 therefore the particular characteristics of fish canning effluents and operational parameters inflicted a narrower selection of the eukaryotic populations that participate in the wwtp functionality than that observed for the bacterial communities this suggests a redundant functionality in the bacterial community since different bacterial taxa can carry out the same roles in the wwtps according to the statistical analyses here employed nms plot fig 5 table s10 ww nacl was the main factor that influenced the distribution of the samples along axis 1 which explained 52 of the total variance suggesting that this variable specifically modulated the structure of the dominant otus found in the 4 fish canning wwtps despite the influence of other factors this result is supported by previous literature which highlighted the role of nacl concentration as a major factor influencing as community structure and wwtp performance 15 64 74 in addition to that other individual factors and in lesser degree the type of configuration were also involved in the assembly of the microbial communities of each wwtp in this sense the trends of ww nh4 and as vss influenced in opposite ways the bacterial community structures of both f1 and f2 facilities similarly the bacterial community structures of f3 and f4 facilities diverged mostly due to the differences of both ww nacl and as nacl although ww toc was also a very influential factor in this sense the capacity of these variables to modulate the structure of bacterial communities in wwtp has been previously and amply described in different scientific works

113 115 the otus displaying the higher or lower values of the pearson s correlation coefficient r with the concentration of nacl r 0 99 or 0 99 are shown in table 2 those otus whose ras were most positively correlated to nacl concentration could be addressed as salt tolerant and or halophilic bacteria which could perform the former functions of the halophobic bacteria in as of wwtps operated under high nacl content there is to note that the otus here considered salt tolerant halophilic were distributed among different phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi gemmatimonadetes and proteobacteria and the group of bacteria unclassified among the different mechanisms to cope with salt stress the increase of osmolytes and the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes have been described in different members of actinobacteria 116 and chloroflexi 117 and the presence of an acidic proteome has been proposed as the main adaptation to nacl stress in bacteroidetes 118 and proteobacteria 119 although some authors 120 have recently proposed gemmatimonadetes as halophilic or halotolerant bacteria the mechanisms involved in their nacl adaptation are not yet established on the other hand some genera belonging to the phylum planctomycetes have been described as well adapted to high salinity conditions in some industrial wwtps such as those from textile industries 67 however in the current work the ras of otus taxonomically affiliated to phylum planctomycetes within the total community were very low indicating that they most probably lacked important roles in these wwtps although this work was pioneer in the analysis of the nacl effect on the bacterial community in fish canning wwtps further research is needed to unravel the importance of nacl for the shaping of microbial communities in saline influents of either fish canning or other industrial wwtps in order to address their contribution to the adequate management of these saline effluents according the data here showed future studies building on the results here presented could also aim at the identification of the key players in the microbial community necessary for an optimal treatment of the industrial fish canning effluents 4 conclusion the results presented here showed that high nacl concentrations exerted a negative pressure over the absolute abundances of total bacteria and fungi mycolata paos and gaos in the as of four full scale fish canning wwtps however it was not a barrier for the proliferation of aob populations higher nacl concentrations correlated positively with an increased relative abundance of otus belonging to the phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi gemmatimonadetes and proteobacteria the bacterial communities structures were highly different among the 4 analysed wwtps indicating a strong modulating effect of the particular ww characteristics and the operational parameters of each facility rather than the type of configuration these findings provide

civil and environmental engineering university of iceland is 107 iceland direct membrane filtration dmf has recently gained attention as an alternative secondary biological wastewater treatment process this study evaluated direct microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf performance and cleaning protocols during crossflow dmf of primary municipal wastewater effluent several types of mf and uf membranes were examined by threshold flux determination and two types of membranes mf 0 08 μm uf 100 kda were chosen for exploring membrane fouling mechanisms at different feed pressures via both fouling resistance analysis and optical coherence tomography oct observation the results revealed that both mf and uf displayed three stage fouling behaviors i e initial intermediate pore blocking followed by two stage cake filtration increasing feed pressure from 8 kpa to 50 kpa could accelerate physically reversible fouling rate consistent with simulated cake filtration constant during physical flushing the cake layer was more readily removed from the uf membrane while residual porous cake layer was present on the mf membrane regardless of the feed pressure with extending filtration cleaning cycle shortening filtration duration and elevating cleaning solution temperature to from 25 c to 50 c benefited for irreversible fouling alleviation at 50 c the geothermal water performed similar cleaning behaviors as clean water facilitating lower reversible and irreversible fouling than the geothermal brine this study shed light on the feasibility of using high temperature geothermal water for periodic physical cleaning during dmf of wastewater under icelandic scenario keywords direct membrane filtration fouling mechanism optical coherence tomography physical cleaning wastewater treatment 1 introduction in the conventional wastewater treatment system a biological process e g activated sludge process is generally used as an efficient secondary step to further purify the primary treated wastewater 1 in the biological processes microorganisms perform their roles in degrading organics and nutrients in the wastewater and their activities are associated with environmental conditions and wastewater characteristics 2 it has been recognized that low temperature could severely inhibit microbial activities leading to limited removal efficiency of organics and nutrients 3 thus the biological wastewater treatment process remains challenging in cold climate regions recently direct membrane filtration dmf has received great attention as an alternative option for conventional biological secondary treatment because of its several advantages such as easily adaptable for existing plants limited maintenance low footprint and high quality permeate 4 7 moreover dmf allows increased nutrient reuse and energy generation from rejected organics which potentially reduces overall wastewater treatment costs 4 8 9 compared to membrane bioreactor integrating biological degradation and membrane filtration dmf of wastewater appeared to experience more membrane fouling caused by the high organic content of wastewater due to limited biodegradation 10 effective fouling control strategies during dmf of wastewater such as gas sparging 9 membrane vibration 8 9 particle scouring 8 high temperature physical flushing 11 coagulation pretreatment 7 12 and chemically enhanced backwash 10 have been documented on the other hand membrane fouling mechanisms during dmf of wastewater have been intensively investigated although the conclusions considering dominance of cake layer fouling and irreversible fouling were not inclusive 13 in our previous study 11 that employing a crossflow microfiltration mf membrane for dmf of wastewater it was noticed that the dominant fouling would shift from reversible to irreversible fouling with extending filtration flushing cycle direct observation of the fouling layer via an optical coherence tomography oct revealed the tightly attached dense cake layer could expand to highly porous cake layer during flushing followed by combined pore blocking and cake layer compression during filtration with extending filtration cycle the increased pore blocking and cake layer compression led to more serious irreversible fouling which required short period chemical cleaning 15 min at daily basis it is well known that membrane properties such as membrane pore sizes 14 and operation conditions such as intermittent filtration intervals 15 could influence membrane performance and or permeate quality of mbrs in treating municipal wastewater similarly these parameters may also have impacts on the performance of dmf of wastewater however limited research efforts have been put on optimizing dmf of wastewater especially exploring membrane fouling mechanisms under different operation conditions in addition our previous study 11 highlighted that high temperature 50 c water cleaning benefited for membrane fouling alleviation during dmf of wastewater this allows us to investigate the feasibility of using high temperature geothermal water icelandic nature resource for periodical membrane cleaning during dmf of wastewater under icelandic scenario in this study we aim to evaluate the membrane performance of several mf and uf membranes during crossflow dmf of primary treated wastewater by comparing their threshold fluxes the selected mf and uf membranes were employed to illustrate membrane fouling mechanisms by filtration resistance analysis constant flux filtration model fitting 16 and direct observation of cake layer morphology via optical coherence tomography oct under different feed pressures and filtration flushing intervals furthermore dmf of primary treated wastewater was performed with high temperature geothermal water brine as cleaning solution in which the membrane performance and treated water quality were examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the dmf experimental setup is shown in fig 1 in detail a crossflow membrane filtration cell effective membrane area of 16 43 cm2 was located under an optical coherence tomography thorlabs usa the quartz window in the membrane cell allowed in situ observation of cake layer on the membrane surface the feed water was maintained at 3 l in the feed tank by periodically topping up with fresh primary treated wastewater the feed water was delivered into the filtration cell with a gear pump cole parmer usa at a flow velocity of 0 1 m s a pressure valve on the feed side was employed to adjust feed pressure 8 and 50 kpa the constant permeate flow was achieved by a peristaltic pump cole parmer usa and its weight was measured by a digital balance mettler toledo usa the retentate was recycled back to the feed tank the pressure gauges on feed and permeate lines as well as the balance were connected to a computer in which a labview software national instruments usa was installed to record the reading data of pressure gauges and balance 2 2 municipal wastewater collection in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the feed wastewater was collected from the primary settling tank in the ulu pandan wastewater reclamation plant singapore and adjusted to the total cod of 70 mg l relatively comparable to icelandic wastewater in section 3 3 the feed wastewater was collected from the primary settling tank in klettagarðar wastewater treatment plant iceland the wastewater characteristics were summarized in table s1 2 3 membranes and threshold flux determination the threshold fluxes of several mf and uf membranes listed in table s2 were examined in order to select a mf membrane and a uf membrane for the following direct membrane filtration experiments in detail in the crossflow filtration cell a piece of new membrane was installed and filtered with clean water for 30 min to remove impurity after that the wastewater was filtered and the permeate flux was increased from 5 to 40 l m2h lmh at 15 min interval the transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded and the tmp increase rate dtmp dt under each applied flux condition was calculated the relationship of dtmp dt vs permeate flux was plotted and the threshold flux was determined based on the intercept point between a lower fouling rate dtmp dt regime and a higher fouling rate dtmp dt regime i e the maximum permeate flux in the low fouling rate regime 17 2 4 direct membrane filtration and fouling analysis the direct membrane filtration was performed in the crossflow membrane filtration cell fig 1 under constant flux filtration with periodic cleaning mode the feed pressure was maintained at a constant level during membrane filtration so the pressure in the permeate side was variable i e tmp development profile indicating membrane fouling before wastewater filtration clean water filtration was performed for 30 min and the average tmpm was calculated during wastewater filtration the tmp was recorded periodically and the tmp data at the end of wastewater filtration was defined as tmpt after flushing with cleaning solution clean water geothermal water geothermal brine details in table s3 along the membrane at a crossflow velocity of 0 1 m s the tmp data during initial wastewater filtration period 0 5 min was defined as tmpp the fouling resistance r was determined using the following equation r tmp μj in which μ is the viscosity of permeate at experimental temperature and j the applied filtration flux 18 the membrane resistance rm total resistance rt and resistance after clean solution flushing rp was calculated as tmpm μj tmpt μj and tmpp μj respectively the physically reversible fouling resistance rr was defined as the difference between rt and rp physically irreversible fouling resistance rir was defined as the difference between rp and rm the physically reversible or irreversible resistance rate was calculated by dividing rr or rir with filtration duration respectively furthermore the tmp data were employed to fit the previously reported constant flux crossflow model table s4 16 in order to illustrate the fouling mechanisms at different filtration stages a two sample t test was applied to examine the statistical significance of two sets of data at a confidence level of 95 2 5 water quality analysis the cod in the wastewater samples was measured using cod analysis kit hach usa and spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa following the manufacturer s instructions total suspended solids tss were analyzed using standard methods 19 dissolved organic substances i e scod and stoc in the wastewater samples was collected after filtering the samples with a 0 45 μm filter and measured by cod analysis kit hach usa and using a toc tn analyzer shimadzu japan the ph conductivity turbidity levels were measured using ph meter hach usa conductivity meter hach usa and turbidity meter vwr usa respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 threshold flux determination in this study three types of uf and mf membranes table s2 were employed for threshold flux examination in order to identify the suitable mf uf membrane for direct membrane filtration of wastewater fig 2 describes the dtmp dt profiles under step increased permeate fluxes at feed pressures of 8 and 50 kpa respectively as shown in fig 2a the pvdf membrane 250 kda at a threshold flux at 20 lmh showed a more significant dtmp dt increasing pattern compared to pes 100 kda at a threshold flux at 25 lmh and rc membrane 100 kda at a threshold flux at 30 lmh in addition the feed pressure had almost no effect on the threshold flux of the rc membrane 100 kda maintaining at 30 lmh in terms of the tested mf membranes fig 2b their threshold fluxes were 30 lmh under both feed pressure conditions however it was clearly observed that at the high permeate flux region above 30 lmh increasing feed pressure from 8 to 50 kpa led to more significant jump of membrane fouling rate i e dtmp dt regardless of the mf membrane type for both tested uf and mf membranes it is noted that the greater membrane pore size did not lead to better membrane performance possibly because other factors such as material hydrophobicity porosity surface roughness and chemistry internal structure and tortuosity could also influence the membrane performance 20 based on the higher threshold flux levels and slowly increasing patterns of dtmp dt profiles the rc membrane 100 kda and pvdf 0 08 μm were chosen as the uf and mf membranes respectively for the following experiments in the section 3 2 3 2 effect of feed pressure on direct uf and mf of wastewater 3 2 1 membrane fouling mechanisms to explain the uf mf membrane fouling mechanisms during direct membrane filtration of wastewater under different feed pressure conditions continuous filtration of wastewater was performed at a sub threshold flux of 25 lmh and the membrane fouling potential was presented as the tmp evolution profile with filtration time shown in fig 3 a crossflow constant flux filtration model table s4 was employed to illustrate the membrane fouling mechanisms 16 the four tmp profile data fig 3 were well fitted to the combined intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration models accordingly the simulated intermediate pore blocking constants and cake filtration constants were presented in table 1 in detail during the initial stage 30 min a rapid increase of tmp at 1 2 kpa was noticed and the tmp profiles followed the intermediate pore blocking model the uf and mf membranes experienced comparable intermediate pore blocking constants under both feed pressure conditions p 0 05 table 1 in addition it was found that an increase of feed pressure from 8 to 50 kpa did not significantly affect intermediate pore blocking of both uf and mf membranes p 0 05 table 1 this reveals that the shear was sufficient to prevent foulants to be driven towards the pores under the higher hydraulic pressure created by the increased feed pressure with extending the filtration time the tmp profiles followed a two stage linear increase pattern i e slower rise of tmp followed by faster tmp increase fig s1 both of which were fitted to the cake filtration model table s4 this implies that after a certain transit time point the cake layer fouling was accelerated possibly due to a shift from membrane foulants interaction to foulants foulants interaction under the low feed pressure of 8 kpa the faster tmp increase the second cake layer fouling stage occurred after 2 6 2 7 h mf and 1 9 2 3 h uf of wastewater filtration while with elevating the feed pressure to 50 kpa the slower tmp increase period the first cake layer fouling stage could be shortened to 1 5 1 8 h mf and 1 3 1 5 h uf respectively as indicated in table 1 during cake filtration at stage 1 the feed pressure had negligible impact on the cake filtration constant for both mf and uf membranes p 0 05 during stage 2 the cake filtration constant values i e kc2 was 2 3 times of those during the initial cake layer formation i e kc1 under each test condition showing an increase of cake resistance development with filtration time under the same feed pressure both uf and mf membranes had the comparable cake filtration constants p 0 05 possibly because the foulants foulants interaction played a dominant role during this stage i e negligible effect by the membrane nature increasing feed pressure could accelerate cake layer fouling for both mf and uf membranes during stage 2 p 0 05 during dmf of wastewater the organics inorganics and microorganisms were deposited on the membrane to form the cake matrix with compressibility 11 thus when higher local compressive pressure was applied to such bio cake layer the distances of inter foulants decreased and foulants foulants interaction force increased accordingly the dense nature cake was less effectively removed by the applied crossflow shear force 21 22 at the end of wastewater filtration clean water flushing was performed in order to examine the physically reversible and irreversible fouling resistance as described in table 1 for both uf and mf membranes the physically reversible fouling resistance was predominant and irreversible fouling resistance was negligible such observation was similar to the reported findings during dmf of wastewater under dissimilar operation conditions 10 12 furthermore increasing feed pressure could lead to an increase of physically reversible fouling rate p 0 05 meanwhile both uf and mf membranes displayed comparable reversible fouling rate under each feed pressure condition p 0 05 these observations were consistent with the trend of the simulated cake filtration constant at stage 2 the cake layer morphology during wastewater filtration was examined via direct observation with oct the images were recorded periodically and presented in fig 4 a thin cake layer with mushroom like depositions on both uf and mf membranes was clearly observed after the tmp reached 5 10 kpa with tmp increasing the growth of the mushroom like foulants were pronounced especially for the uf membrane under the high feed pressure this was in coherence with cake fouling resistance data which indicated that more foulant depositions on the membrane led to increased tmp however the cake layer thickness did not significantly expand with extending filtration corresponding to the compressibility nature of cake layer on the other hand a clear expansion of the cake layer during flushing of both uf and mf membranes was noticed when the driving force was released a recent study 22 revealed that pressure relaxation could result in permeate inflow across the membrane and cake layer leading to expansion of the residual cake layer that could not be removed by crossflow shear force furthermore the oct images showed that cake layer on the uf membrane could be effectively removed after 10 min physical cleaning which was correspondent with negligible physically irreversible fouling resistance table 1 for the case of mf membrane only those loosely attached foulants were readily detached from the mf membrane after 10 min physical cleaning and the residual cake layer remained on the mf membrane surface however these remaining foulants had negligible fouling resistance i e physically irreversible fouling resistance table 1 suggesting it was highly porous 11 23 in a previous study 22 the researchers have employed the mathematical model to elucidate that lower membrane resistance or lower cake resistance facilitated shortening cake swelling duration during relaxation period accordingly benefiting for expanded cake removal by crossflow shear force as the mf membrane pvdf 0 08 μm and its cake layer had lower resistances than those of the uf membrane rc 100 kda respectively table s2 and table 1 it was expected that the cake expansion duration was shorter and more effective removal of cake layer was occurred possibly the interaction of foulants with the mf membrane surface was stronger than that with the uf membrane as they were made of different polymers as a result once the driving force was released the expanded cake that was not readily removed by crossflow shear force remained on the mf membrane surface 3 2 2 filtration physical cleaning interval to further optimize the direct uf and mf membrane filtration of wastewater the membrane performance under different filtration durations with a fixed 25 c clean water flushing period 0 25 h per cycle were compared the tmp profiles of multi filtration physical cleaning cycles were illustrated in fig 5 obviously under the same physical cleaning condition extending filtration duration from 0 5 h to 1 25 h to 1 75 h could lead to more significant tmp increase for both uf and mf membranes especially after 1 2 cycles under the same filtration physical cleaning interval a higher tmp increase rate i e dtmp dt was noticed under the feed pressure of 50 kpa than that under 8 kpa this indicated that a combination of low feed pressure and short filtration physical cleaning interval could be favorable for sustainable long term direct membrane filtration of primary wastewater furthermore the fouling resistance distributions under different filtration durations were analyzed based on the tmp profiles in fig 5 to compare the fouling resistance in terms of filtration cycle the physically reversible and irreversible fouling rates which were calculated by dividing the respective fouling resistance with filtration time per cycle were shown in fig 6 it appears that both uf and mf membranes displayed several similar fouling resistance development patterns first with extending filtration cleaning cycle both uf and mf membranes displayed 1 increased physically reversible and irreversible fouling resistance rates regardless of filtration physical cleaning interval and applied feed pressure 2 elevated ratios of irreversible fouling to the total fouling under lower feed pressure 8 kpa it was recalled that the physical cleaning would almost fully remove the cake layer from the uf membrane and facilitated remaining relatively porous nature cake layer on the mf membrane during the first filtration physical cleaning cycle oct images in fig 4 possibly for the uf membrane the residual limited foulants invisible by oct may modify the uf surface property and facilitate its interaction with the foulants in the following filtration cycle for the mf membrane the residual visible cake layer with highly porous characteristics may readily allow the potential foulants into its matrix 11 thus in the subsequent wastewater filtration cycle the physical cleaning effectiveness was compromised showing a reduced trend with increasing filtration cleaning cycle second compared to the higher feed pressure 50 kpa the lower feed pressure 8 kpa led to less physically reversible and irreversible resistance rates under the same filtration cleaning cycle condition 1 25 h filtration 0 25 h cleaning as illustrated in fig s2 simulated intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration constants by fitting the tmp data of fig 5 into the model equations in the presence of the same crossflow shear force the higher feed pressure i e inducing more drag force on the foulants could facilitate fine foulants plugging into the membrane pores porous cake layer matrix i e higher intermediate pore blocking constant and promote cake filtration resistance via compaction of the residual porous cake layer foulants i e higher cake filtration constant additionally at the feed pressure of 8 kpa shortening wastewater filtration duration from 1 75 h to 1 25 h to 0 5 h was beneficial to lower irreversible fouling rate of the mf membrane which was consistent with the pattern of the simulated intermediate pore blocking profiles fig s2 c with longer wastewater filtration duration more foulants would accumulate on the membrane surface and could effectively block the porous structure in the cake matrix and increase cake density these dense foulant layers could not be easily detached from the membrane surface by shear force accordingly the reversible porous cake layer greatly shifted to irreversible dense cake layer which promoted irreversible fouling rate or intermediate pore blocking constant this suggests that increasing physical cleaning frequency could alleviate pore blocking of the cake matrix and formation of more compact cake layers nevertheless it is recognized that the irreversible fouling rate increased with filtration cycle during uf mf of primary wastewater when 25 c clean water was employed as cleaning solution in this study thus long term membrane operation could be compromised under such physical cleaning philosophy to achieve sustainable direct membrane filtration of wastewater additional measures for effective irreversible fouling control would be necessary for example by employing periodically short term physical cleaning with elevated high temperature water or and chemical cleaning 10 11 by adding coagulants 24 or by combined coagulation with air backflushing 25 in addition the mf membranes appeared to display better membrane performances than the uf membranes in terms of both threshold flux determination fig 2 and short term filtration cleaning experiments fig 5 although the mf permeate could meet the eu wastewater discharge standards table s1 the uf membranes generally offer superior treated water quality than the mf membranes due to size exclusion effect thus when wastewater reclamation scenario is adopted e g direct use of uf mf permeate for irrigation post treatment of uf mf permeate for non potable reuse both membrane performance and permeate quality especially emerging pollutants and pathogens would need to be comprehensively evaluated 3 3 direct mf of wastewater with geothermal water brine cleaning in our previous study 11 cleaning water at a higher temperature 50 c has shown its capability in greatly reducing the physically irreversible fouling and intermediate pore blocking constant however maintaining cleaning water at a higher temperature requires additional energy consumption inevitably increasing the operation cost of dmf in iceland high temperature geothermal water is natural resource which could be the potential source of cleaning water during dmf of primary wastewater in this study the feasibility of using high temperature 50 c geothermal water or geothermal brine the waste stream generated during geothermal power production cycle as physical cleaning solution was examined with a clean water cleaning method 50 c as comparison the geothermal water brine and clean water properties are described in table s3 the tmp development profiles during mf of primary wastewater 0 75 h filtration with 0 25 h cleaning feed pressure 2 kpa were recorded and shown in fig 7a clearly the membrane performance in the presence of various cleaning approaches 50 c followed a sequence as cleaning water geothermal water geothermal brine at high ph 8 45 8 96 geothermal brine at low ph 2 34 3 14 as illustrated in table s3 the geothermal brine contained greater amounts of the ionic elements such as si na k al cl so4 than the cleaning water and geothermal water 34 35 it is known that after physical cleaning the residual porous cake layer remained on the mf membrane fig 4 and the organic components such as biopolymers building blocks low molecular weight neutrals and acids were present in such cake layer matrix 11 on the other hand several previously documented studies 26 28 have proven that the si element could interact with organics especially biopolymers via stable chemical bonds such as sic and si o c to form amorphous complexes leading to severe membrane fouling thus during geothermal brine cleaning the shear force facilitated cake layer removal i e effectively recover tmp fig 7a meanwhile the si element in the geothermal brine may trap into the residual porous cake matrix in the following wastewater filtration cycle si could interact with the organic foulants derived from the feed wastewater aggravating membrane fouling it is noted that si tends to exist as monosilisic acid at ph 8 and as silicate ions at ph 8 29 30 when the geothermal brine was present at an elevating ph level 8 45 8 96 silicate ions could interact with other metal ions na al mg ca fe to form complex e g si with na and al ions to form aluminosilicate precipitate 30 31 reducing the interaction of si with organic foulants thus when geothermal brine at higher ph level was applied as cleaning solution less membrane fouling development during multi filtration cycles was noticed compared to that at lower ph level further analysis on fouling resistance distribution revealed that 1 cake layer fouling i e reversible fouling resistance displayed an increased pattern with filtration cycle and showed its predominance 70 in the total fouling except using the geothermal brine at low ph and high salinity as cleaning solution fig 7b 2 compared to clean water based cleaning the geothermal water brine high ph based cleaning could more effectively alleviate irreversible fouling fig 7c but led to either comparable geothermal water or higher geothermal brine at high ph reversible fouling fig 7b as above mentioned the presence of si in the geothermal water brine promoted the formation of silicate based complexes which may present as cake foulants to increase cake porosity i e reducing cake resistance due to their greater sized nature one the other hand the accumulation of silicate based complexes on the membrane surface also contributed to an increase of cake mass i e increasing cake resistance as a result the greater amount of si in the geothermal brine could dramatically accelerate the cake fouling while when the geothermal brine at low ph was employed as cleaning solution the irreversible fouling increased with extending filtration cycle especially at high salinity condition it is believed that the higher ionic strength could enhance the interaction of inorganic e g si organic foulants 27 or organic organic foulants 32 33 at lower ph levels potentially resisting to the applied shear force during physical cleaning and leading to a shift from physical reversible fouling to irreversible fouling fig 7b and c overall icelandic geothermal water naturally high temperature is feasible to be adopted for physical cleaning during dmf of wastewater due to its comparable performance as clean water and less energy input than clean water requiring heating process to maintain high temperature the potential effect of si on dmf of wastewater and optimization of geothermal water based cleaning protocols during long term operation of dmf is proposed in the future work 4 conclusions in this study the uf and mf membrane fouling and mitigation mechanisms during dmf of primary wastewater with different feed pressures were illustrated by experimental testing model simulation and direct observation via oct the findings were summarized as follows 1 both uf and mf membranes displayed combined intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration mechanisms initial lower cake filtration constants followed by higher cake filtration constants due to cake compressibility during dmf of wastewater increasing feed pressure could lead to an increase of physically reversible fouling rate corresponding to higher cake filtration constant 2 short term physical cleaning 25 c clean water could effectively remove the cake layer from the uf membrane while led to residual porous cake layer remained on the mf membrane regardless of feed pressure however irreversible fouling contribution ratio greatly increased with extending the filtration physical cleaning cycle even under a lower feed pressure 3 in terms of the mf membrane shortening wastewater filtration duration or elevating cleaning water temperature was beneficial to lower irreversible fouling potential 4 compared to geothermal brine cleaning 50 c the geothermal water cleaning 50 c could more effectively alleviate both reversible and irreversible fouling due to less

process this study evaluated direct microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf performance and cleaning protocols during crossflow dmf of primary municipal wastewater effluent several types of mf and uf membranes were examined by threshold flux determination and two types of membranes mf 0 08 μm uf 100 kda were chosen for exploring membrane fouling mechanisms at different feed pressures via both fouling resistance analysis and optical coherence tomography oct observation the results revealed that both mf and uf displayed three stage fouling behaviors i e initial intermediate pore blocking followed by two stage cake filtration increasing feed pressure from 8 kpa to 50 kpa could accelerate physically reversible fouling rate consistent with simulated cake filtration constant during physical flushing the cake layer was more readily removed from the uf membrane while residual porous cake layer was present on the mf membrane regardless of the feed pressure with extending filtration cleaning cycle shortening filtration duration and elevating cleaning solution temperature to from 25 c to 50 c benefited for irreversible fouling alleviation at 50 c the geothermal water performed similar cleaning behaviors as clean water facilitating lower reversible and irreversible fouling than the geothermal brine this study shed light on the feasibility of using high temperature geothermal water for periodic physical cleaning during dmf of wastewater under icelandic scenario keywords direct membrane filtration fouling mechanism optical coherence tomography physical cleaning wastewater treatment 1 introduction in the conventional wastewater treatment system a biological process e g activated sludge process is generally used as an efficient secondary step to further purify the primary treated wastewater 1 in the biological processes microorganisms perform their roles in degrading organics and nutrients in the wastewater and their activities are associated with environmental conditions and wastewater characteristics 2 it has been recognized that low temperature could severely inhibit microbial activities leading to limited removal efficiency of organics and nutrients 3 thus the biological wastewater treatment process remains challenging in cold climate regions recently direct membrane filtration dmf has received great attention as an alternative option for conventional biological secondary treatment because of its several advantages such as easily adaptable for existing plants limited maintenance low footprint and high quality permeate 4 7 moreover dmf allows increased nutrient reuse and energy generation from rejected organics which potentially reduces overall wastewater treatment costs 4 8 9 compared to membrane bioreactor integrating biological degradation and membrane filtration dmf of wastewater appeared to experience more membrane fouling caused by the high organic content of wastewater due to limited biodegradation 10 effective fouling control strategies during dmf of wastewater such as gas sparging 9 membrane vibration 8 9 particle scouring 8 high temperature physical flushing 11 coagulation pretreatment 7 12 and chemically enhanced backwash 10 have been documented on the other hand membrane fouling mechanisms during dmf of wastewater have been intensively investigated although the conclusions considering dominance of cake layer fouling and irreversible fouling were not inclusive 13 in our previous study 11 that employing a crossflow microfiltration mf membrane for dmf of wastewater it was noticed that the dominant fouling would shift from reversible to irreversible fouling with extending filtration flushing cycle direct observation of the fouling layer via an optical coherence tomography oct revealed the tightly attached dense cake layer could expand to highly porous cake layer during flushing followed by combined pore blocking and cake layer compression during filtration with extending filtration cycle the increased pore blocking and cake layer compression led to more serious irreversible fouling which required short period chemical cleaning 15 min at daily basis it is well known that membrane properties such as membrane pore sizes 14 and operation conditions such as intermittent filtration intervals 15 could influence membrane performance and or permeate quality of mbrs in treating municipal wastewater similarly these parameters may also have impacts on the performance of dmf of wastewater however limited research efforts have been put on optimizing dmf of wastewater especially exploring membrane fouling mechanisms under different operation conditions in addition our previous study 11 highlighted that high temperature 50 c water cleaning benefited for membrane fouling alleviation during dmf of wastewater this allows us to investigate the feasibility of using high temperature geothermal water icelandic nature resource for periodical membrane cleaning during dmf of wastewater under icelandic scenario in this study we aim to evaluate the membrane performance of several mf and uf membranes during crossflow dmf of primary treated wastewater by comparing their threshold fluxes the selected mf and uf membranes were employed to illustrate membrane fouling mechanisms by filtration resistance analysis constant flux filtration model fitting 16 and direct observation of cake layer morphology via optical coherence tomography oct under different feed pressures and filtration flushing intervals furthermore dmf of primary treated wastewater was performed with high temperature geothermal water brine as cleaning solution in which the membrane performance and treated water quality were examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the dmf experimental setup is shown in fig 1 in detail a crossflow membrane filtration cell effective membrane area of 16 43 cm2 was located under an optical coherence tomography thorlabs usa the quartz window in the membrane cell allowed in situ observation of cake layer on the membrane surface the feed water was maintained at 3 l in the feed tank by periodically topping up with fresh primary treated wastewater the feed water was delivered into the filtration cell with a gear pump cole parmer usa at a flow velocity of 0 1 m s a pressure valve on the feed side was employed to adjust feed pressure 8 and 50 kpa the constant permeate flow was achieved by a peristaltic pump cole parmer usa and its weight was measured by a digital balance mettler toledo usa the retentate was recycled back to the feed tank the pressure gauges on feed and permeate lines as well as the balance were connected to a computer in which a labview software national instruments usa was installed to record the reading data of pressure gauges and balance 2 2 municipal wastewater collection in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the feed wastewater was collected from the primary settling tank in the ulu pandan wastewater reclamation plant singapore and adjusted to the total cod of 70 mg l relatively comparable to icelandic wastewater in section 3 3 the feed wastewater was collected from the primary settling tank in klettagarðar wastewater treatment plant iceland the wastewater characteristics were summarized in table s1 2 3 membranes and threshold flux determination the threshold fluxes of several mf and uf membranes listed in table s2 were examined in order to select a mf membrane and a uf membrane for the following direct membrane filtration experiments in detail in the crossflow filtration cell a piece of new membrane was installed and filtered with clean water for 30 min to remove impurity after that the wastewater was filtered and the permeate flux was increased from 5 to 40 l m2h lmh at 15 min interval the transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded and the tmp increase rate dtmp dt under each applied flux condition was calculated the relationship of dtmp dt vs permeate flux was plotted and the threshold flux was determined based on the intercept point between a lower fouling rate dtmp dt regime and a higher fouling rate dtmp dt regime i e the maximum permeate flux in the low fouling rate regime 17 2 4 direct membrane filtration and fouling analysis the direct membrane filtration was performed in the crossflow membrane filtration cell fig 1 under constant flux filtration with periodic cleaning mode the feed pressure was maintained at a constant level during membrane filtration so the pressure in the permeate side was variable i e tmp development profile indicating membrane fouling before wastewater filtration clean water filtration was performed for 30 min and the average tmpm was calculated during wastewater filtration the tmp was recorded periodically and the tmp data at the end of wastewater filtration was defined as tmpt after flushing with cleaning solution clean water geothermal water geothermal brine details in table s3 along the membrane at a crossflow velocity of 0 1 m s the tmp data during initial wastewater filtration period 0 5 min was defined as tmpp the fouling resistance r was determined using the following equation r tmp μj in which μ is the viscosity of permeate at experimental temperature and j the applied filtration flux 18 the membrane resistance rm total resistance rt and resistance after clean solution flushing rp was calculated as tmpm μj tmpt μj and tmpp μj respectively the physically reversible fouling resistance rr was defined as the difference between rt and rp physically irreversible fouling resistance rir was defined as the difference between rp and rm the physically reversible or irreversible resistance rate was calculated by dividing rr or rir with filtration duration respectively furthermore the tmp data were employed to fit the previously reported constant flux crossflow model table s4 16 in order to illustrate the fouling mechanisms at different filtration stages a two sample t test was applied to examine the statistical significance of two sets of data at a confidence level of 95 2 5 water quality analysis the cod in the wastewater samples was measured using cod analysis kit hach usa and spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa following the manufacturer s instructions total suspended solids tss were analyzed using standard methods 19 dissolved organic substances i e scod and stoc in the wastewater samples was collected after filtering the samples with a 0 45 μm filter and measured by cod analysis kit hach usa and using a toc tn analyzer shimadzu japan the ph conductivity turbidity levels were measured using ph meter hach usa conductivity meter hach usa and turbidity meter vwr usa respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 threshold flux determination in this study three types of uf and mf membranes table s2 were employed for threshold flux examination in order to identify the suitable mf uf membrane for direct membrane filtration of wastewater fig 2 describes the dtmp dt profiles under step increased permeate fluxes at feed pressures of 8 and 50 kpa respectively as shown in fig 2a the pvdf membrane 250 kda at a threshold flux at 20 lmh showed a more significant dtmp dt increasing pattern compared to pes 100 kda at a threshold flux at 25 lmh and rc membrane 100 kda at a threshold flux at 30 lmh in addition the feed pressure had almost no effect on the threshold flux of the rc membrane 100 kda maintaining at 30 lmh in terms of the tested mf membranes fig 2b their threshold fluxes were 30 lmh under both feed pressure conditions however it was clearly observed that at the high permeate flux region above 30 lmh increasing feed pressure from 8 to 50 kpa led to more significant jump of membrane fouling rate i e dtmp dt regardless of the mf membrane type for both tested uf and mf membranes it is noted that the greater membrane pore size did not lead to better membrane performance possibly because other factors such as material hydrophobicity porosity surface roughness and chemistry internal structure and tortuosity could also influence the membrane performance 20 based on the higher threshold flux levels and slowly increasing patterns of dtmp dt profiles the rc membrane 100 kda and pvdf 0 08 μm were chosen as the uf and mf membranes respectively for the following experiments in the section 3 2 3 2 effect of feed pressure on direct uf and mf of wastewater 3 2 1 membrane fouling mechanisms to explain the uf mf membrane fouling mechanisms during direct membrane filtration of wastewater under different feed pressure conditions continuous filtration of wastewater was performed at a sub threshold flux of 25 lmh and the membrane fouling potential was presented as the tmp evolution profile with filtration time shown in fig 3 a crossflow constant flux filtration model table s4 was employed to illustrate the membrane fouling mechanisms 16 the four tmp profile data fig 3 were well fitted to the combined intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration models accordingly the simulated intermediate pore blocking constants and cake filtration constants were presented in table 1 in detail during the initial stage 30 min a rapid increase of tmp at 1 2 kpa was noticed and the tmp profiles followed the intermediate pore blocking model the uf and mf membranes experienced comparable intermediate pore blocking constants under both feed pressure conditions p 0 05 table 1 in addition it was found that an increase of feed pressure from 8 to 50 kpa did not significantly affect intermediate pore blocking of both uf and mf membranes p 0 05 table 1 this reveals that the shear was sufficient to prevent foulants to be driven towards the pores under the higher hydraulic pressure created by the increased feed pressure with extending the filtration time the tmp profiles followed a two stage linear increase pattern i e slower rise of tmp followed by faster tmp increase fig s1 both of which were fitted to the cake filtration model table s4 this implies that after a certain transit time point the cake layer fouling was accelerated possibly due to a shift from membrane foulants interaction to foulants foulants interaction under the low feed pressure of 8 kpa the faster tmp increase the second cake layer fouling stage occurred after 2 6 2 7 h mf and 1 9 2 3 h uf of wastewater filtration while with elevating the feed pressure to 50 kpa the slower tmp increase period the first cake layer fouling stage could be shortened to 1 5 1 8 h mf and 1 3 1 5 h uf respectively as indicated in table 1 during cake filtration at stage 1 the feed pressure had negligible impact on the cake filtration constant for both mf and uf membranes p 0 05 during stage 2 the cake filtration constant values i e kc2 was 2 3 times of those during the initial cake layer formation i e kc1 under each test condition showing an increase of cake resistance development with filtration time under the same feed pressure both uf and mf membranes had the comparable cake filtration constants p 0 05 possibly because the foulants foulants interaction played a dominant role during this stage i e negligible effect by the membrane nature increasing feed pressure could accelerate cake layer fouling for both mf and uf membranes during stage 2 p 0 05 during dmf of wastewater the organics inorganics and microorganisms were deposited on the membrane to form the cake matrix with compressibility 11 thus when higher local compressive pressure was applied to such bio cake layer the distances of inter foulants decreased and foulants foulants interaction force increased accordingly the dense nature cake was less effectively removed by the applied crossflow shear force 21 22 at the end of wastewater filtration clean water flushing was performed in order to examine the physically reversible and irreversible fouling resistance as described in table 1 for both uf and mf membranes the physically reversible fouling resistance was predominant and irreversible fouling resistance was negligible such observation was similar to the reported findings during dmf of wastewater under dissimilar operation conditions 10 12 furthermore increasing feed pressure could lead to an increase of physically reversible fouling rate p 0 05 meanwhile both uf and mf membranes displayed comparable reversible fouling rate under each feed pressure condition p 0 05 these observations were consistent with the trend of the simulated cake filtration constant at stage 2 the cake layer morphology during wastewater filtration was examined via direct observation with oct the images were recorded periodically and presented in fig 4 a thin cake layer with mushroom like depositions on both uf and mf membranes was clearly observed after the tmp reached 5 10 kpa with tmp increasing the growth of the mushroom like foulants were pronounced especially for the uf membrane under the high feed pressure this was in coherence with cake fouling resistance data which indicated that more foulant depositions on the membrane led to increased tmp however the cake layer thickness did not significantly expand with extending filtration corresponding to the compressibility nature of cake layer on the other hand a clear expansion of the cake layer during flushing of both uf and mf membranes was noticed when the driving force was released a recent study 22 revealed that pressure relaxation could result in permeate inflow across the membrane and cake layer leading to expansion of the residual cake layer that could not be removed by crossflow shear force furthermore the oct images showed that cake layer on the uf membrane could be effectively removed after 10 min physical cleaning which was correspondent with negligible physically irreversible fouling resistance table 1 for the case of mf membrane only those loosely attached foulants were readily detached from the mf membrane after 10 min physical cleaning and the residual cake layer remained on the mf membrane surface however these remaining foulants had negligible fouling resistance i e physically irreversible fouling resistance table 1 suggesting it was highly porous 11 23 in a previous study 22 the researchers have employed the mathematical model to elucidate that lower membrane resistance or lower cake resistance facilitated shortening cake swelling duration during relaxation period accordingly benefiting for expanded cake removal by crossflow shear force as the mf membrane pvdf 0 08 μm and its cake layer had lower resistances than those of the uf membrane rc 100 kda respectively table s2 and table 1 it was expected that the cake expansion duration was shorter and more effective removal of cake layer was occurred possibly the interaction of foulants with the mf membrane surface was stronger than that with the uf membrane as they were made of different polymers as a result once the driving force was released the expanded cake that was not readily removed by crossflow shear force remained on the mf membrane surface 3 2 2 filtration physical cleaning interval to further optimize the direct uf and mf membrane filtration of wastewater the membrane performance under different filtration durations with a fixed 25 c clean water flushing period 0 25 h per cycle were compared the tmp profiles of multi filtration physical cleaning cycles were illustrated in fig 5 obviously under the same physical cleaning condition extending filtration duration from 0 5 h to 1 25 h to 1 75 h could lead to more significant tmp increase for both uf and mf membranes especially after 1 2 cycles under the same filtration physical cleaning interval a higher tmp increase rate i e dtmp dt was noticed under the feed pressure of 50 kpa than that under 8 kpa this indicated that a combination of low feed pressure and short filtration physical cleaning interval could be favorable for sustainable long term direct membrane filtration of primary wastewater furthermore the fouling resistance distributions under different filtration durations were analyzed based on the tmp profiles in fig 5 to compare the fouling resistance in terms of filtration cycle the physically reversible and irreversible fouling rates which were calculated by dividing the respective fouling resistance with filtration time per cycle were shown in fig 6 it appears that both uf and mf membranes displayed several similar fouling resistance development patterns first with extending filtration cleaning cycle both uf and mf membranes displayed 1 increased physically reversible and irreversible fouling resistance rates regardless of filtration physical cleaning interval and applied feed pressure 2 elevated ratios of irreversible fouling to the total fouling under lower feed pressure 8 kpa it was recalled that the physical cleaning would almost fully remove the cake layer from the uf membrane and facilitated remaining relatively porous nature cake layer on the mf membrane during the first filtration physical cleaning cycle oct images in fig 4 possibly for the uf membrane the residual limited foulants invisible by oct may modify the uf surface property and facilitate its interaction with the foulants in the following filtration cycle for the mf membrane the residual visible cake layer with highly porous characteristics may readily allow the potential foulants into its matrix 11 thus in the subsequent wastewater filtration cycle the physical cleaning effectiveness was compromised showing a reduced trend with increasing filtration cleaning cycle second compared to the higher feed pressure 50 kpa the lower feed pressure 8 kpa led to less physically reversible and irreversible resistance rates under the same filtration cleaning cycle condition 1 25 h filtration 0 25 h cleaning as illustrated in fig s2 simulated intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration constants by fitting the tmp data of fig 5 into the model equations in the presence of the same crossflow shear force the higher feed pressure i e inducing more drag force on the foulants could facilitate fine foulants plugging into the membrane pores porous cake layer matrix i e higher intermediate pore blocking constant and promote cake filtration resistance via compaction of the residual porous cake layer foulants i e higher cake filtration constant additionally at the feed pressure of 8 kpa shortening wastewater filtration duration from 1 75 h to 1 25 h to 0 5 h was beneficial to lower irreversible fouling rate of the mf membrane which was consistent with the pattern of the simulated intermediate pore blocking profiles fig s2 c with longer wastewater filtration duration more foulants would accumulate on the membrane surface and could effectively block the porous structure in the cake matrix and increase cake density these dense foulant layers could not be easily detached from the membrane surface by shear force accordingly the reversible porous cake layer greatly shifted to irreversible dense cake layer which promoted irreversible fouling rate or intermediate pore blocking constant this suggests that increasing physical cleaning frequency could alleviate pore blocking of the cake matrix and formation of more compact cake layers nevertheless it is recognized that the irreversible fouling rate increased with filtration cycle during uf mf of primary wastewater when 25 c clean water was employed as cleaning solution in this study thus long term membrane operation could be compromised under such physical cleaning philosophy to achieve sustainable direct membrane filtration of wastewater additional measures for effective irreversible fouling control would be necessary for example by employing periodically short term physical cleaning with elevated high temperature water or and chemical cleaning 10 11 by adding coagulants 24 or by combined coagulation with air backflushing 25 in addition the mf membranes appeared to display better membrane performances than the uf membranes in terms of both threshold flux determination fig 2 and short term filtration cleaning experiments fig 5 although the mf permeate could meet the eu wastewater discharge standards table s1 the uf membranes generally offer superior treated water quality than the mf membranes due to size exclusion effect thus when wastewater reclamation scenario is adopted e g direct use of uf mf permeate for irrigation post treatment of uf mf permeate for non potable reuse both membrane performance and permeate quality especially emerging pollutants and pathogens would need to be comprehensively evaluated 3 3 direct mf of wastewater with geothermal water brine cleaning in our previous study 11 cleaning water at a higher temperature 50 c has shown its capability in greatly reducing the physically irreversible fouling and intermediate pore blocking constant however maintaining cleaning water at a higher temperature requires additional energy consumption inevitably increasing the operation cost of dmf in iceland high temperature geothermal water is natural resource which could be the potential source of cleaning water during dmf of primary wastewater in this study the feasibility of using high temperature 50 c geothermal water or geothermal brine the waste stream generated during geothermal power production cycle as physical cleaning solution was examined with a clean water cleaning method 50 c as comparison the geothermal water brine and clean water properties are described in table s3 the tmp development profiles during mf of primary wastewater 0 75 h filtration with 0 25 h cleaning feed pressure 2 kpa were recorded and shown in fig 7a clearly the membrane performance in the presence of various cleaning approaches 50 c followed a sequence as cleaning water geothermal water geothermal brine at high ph 8 45 8 96 geothermal brine at low ph 2 34 3 14 as illustrated in table s3 the geothermal brine contained greater amounts of the ionic elements such as si na k al cl so4 than the cleaning water and geothermal water 34 35 it is known that after physical cleaning the residual porous cake layer remained on the mf membrane fig 4 and the organic components such as biopolymers building blocks low molecular weight neutrals and acids were present in such cake layer matrix 11 on the other hand several previously documented studies 26 28 have proven that the si element could interact with organics especially biopolymers via stable chemical bonds such as sic and si o c to form amorphous complexes leading to severe membrane fouling thus during geothermal brine cleaning the shear force facilitated cake layer removal i e effectively recover tmp fig 7a meanwhile the si element in the geothermal brine may trap into the residual porous cake matrix in the following wastewater filtration cycle si could interact with the organic foulants derived from the feed wastewater aggravating membrane fouling it is noted that si tends to exist as monosilisic acid at ph 8 and as silicate ions at ph 8 29 30 when the geothermal brine was present at an elevating ph level 8 45 8 96 silicate ions could interact with other metal ions na al mg ca fe to form complex e g si with na and al ions to form aluminosilicate precipitate 30 31 reducing the interaction of si with organic foulants thus when geothermal brine at higher ph level was applied as cleaning solution less membrane fouling development during multi filtration cycles was noticed compared to that at lower ph level further analysis on fouling resistance distribution revealed that 1 cake layer fouling i e reversible fouling resistance displayed an increased pattern with filtration cycle and showed its predominance 70 in the total fouling except using the geothermal brine at low ph and high salinity as cleaning solution fig 7b 2 compared to clean water based cleaning the geothermal water brine high ph based cleaning could more effectively alleviate irreversible fouling fig 7c but led to either comparable geothermal water or higher geothermal brine at high ph reversible fouling fig 7b as above mentioned the presence of si in the geothermal water brine promoted the formation of silicate based complexes which may present as cake foulants to increase cake porosity i e reducing cake resistance due to their greater sized nature one the other hand the accumulation of silicate based complexes on the membrane surface also contributed to an increase of cake mass i e increasing cake resistance as a result the greater amount of si in the geothermal brine could dramatically accelerate the cake fouling while when the geothermal brine at low ph was employed as cleaning solution the irreversible fouling increased with extending filtration cycle especially at high salinity condition it is believed that the higher ionic strength could enhance the interaction of inorganic e g si organic foulants 27 or organic organic foulants 32 33 at lower ph levels potentially resisting to the applied shear force during physical cleaning and leading to a shift from physical reversible fouling to irreversible fouling fig 7b and c overall icelandic geothermal water naturally high temperature is feasible to be adopted for physical cleaning during dmf of wastewater due to its comparable performance as clean water and less energy input than clean water requiring heating process to maintain high temperature the potential effect of si on dmf of wastewater and optimization of geothermal water based cleaning protocols during long term operation of dmf is proposed in the future work 4 conclusions in this study the uf and mf membrane fouling and mitigation mechanisms during dmf of primary wastewater with different feed pressures were illustrated by experimental testing model simulation and direct observation via oct the findings were summarized as follows 1 both uf and mf membranes displayed combined intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration mechanisms initial lower cake filtration constants followed by higher cake filtration constants due to cake compressibility during dmf of wastewater increasing feed pressure could lead to an increase of physically reversible fouling rate corresponding to higher cake filtration constant 2 short term physical cleaning 25 c clean water could effectively remove the cake layer from the uf membrane while led to residual porous cake layer remained on the mf membrane regardless of feed pressure however irreversible fouling contribution ratio greatly increased with extending the filtration physical cleaning cycle even under a lower feed pressure 3 in terms of the mf membrane shortening wastewater filtration duration or elevating cleaning water temperature was beneficial to lower irreversible fouling potential 4 compared to geothermal brine cleaning 50 c the geothermal water cleaning 50 c could more effectively alleviate both reversible and irreversible fouling due to less

13249,in this study microbial cellulose mc was conductive by polyaniline pani stabilization and used as a biopolymer cathode for the first time in the presence of nano pyrite fes2 for electrochemical removal of hexavalent chromium cr vi characterization of mc pani and nano pyrite was conducted by fe sem ftir edx and xrd analyzes according to the results nano pyrite mc and mc pani removed 41 17 8 54 and 35 4 of 10 mg l 1 cr vi within 60 min without the electric current respectively at the same time the highest cr vi removal rate 98 6 was observed in the electrochemical process 80 ma with the simultaneous presence of mc pani cathode and nano pyrite the study of mechanisms showed that creating different electron transfer pathways between mc pani nano pyrite and cr vi improves the removal efficiency in this system the output data from the icp oes analysis showed that the amount of total cr remaining in the solution was 0 11 mg l 1 at the end of the process furthermore the total cr values based on the weight percentage in the mc pani cathode 1 1 g and nano pyrite 0 08 g were 3 9 and 5 4 respectively these results suggested that an electrochemical reduction adsorption process occurred in the cr removal path however redox potential measurements 383 to 632 mv showed that the dominant process in cr vi removal was electrochemical reduction the recording of 71 1 cr vi removal after five runs confirmed the remarkable reusability of the synthesized cathode and catalyst this study introduced an efficient sustainable and economical integrated electrochemical system for cr vi removal through synergistic effect and cooperation between the mc pani cathode and the nano pyrite catalyst graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrochemical chromium microbial cellulose polyaniline cathode nano pyrite 1 introduction today the human lifestyle depends on industrial activities from the point of view of environmental engineering the main consequence of industrialization is the entry of various hazardous pollutants into the environment 1 2 heavy metals are considered as environmental pollutants due to their stability toxicity non degradability carcinogenic and teratogenic 3 4 chromium cr is one of the most dangerous heavy metals that enter the environment and water resources from various industries such as paint processing leather tanning textile steel fabrication electroplating and wood preservation 4 6 although cr exists in different valence states its two states trivalent and hexavalent are more environmentally important 7 long term exposure to hexavalent chromium cr vi can cause skin problems bronchitis kidney and liver damage respiratory problems and gastrointestinal cancer 8 in contrast cr iii is generally insoluble in water and its toxicity is 102 103 times lower than cr vi 9 therefore the maximum contaminant levels of cr vi in drinking water set by the environmental protection agency and world health organization are 0 1 mg l 1 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively 10 techniques commonly for reducing cr vi to cr iii are microbial activities 11 precipitation 12 ion exchange 13 membrane filtration 14 electrochemical reduction 15 and adsorption 16 the electrochemical reduction has been considered due to advantages such as the use of electrons as a clean agent the safety of production and automation capability 17 18 in the process of cr vi electrochemical reduction the transfer of electrons from the cathode to cr causes the reduction of cr vi to cr iii 19 in previous studies metal based cathodes have been used repeatedly for electrochemical reduction of cr vi 20 23 since the use of these cathodes has disadvantages such as the high cost of metals and inactivation of the surface electrode by cr iii precipitate the application of alternative cathodes has been considered 24 25 microbial cellulose mc is a carbohydrate biopolymer that due to its high tensile strength low weight high durability and stability significant water uptake capacity and high degree of porosity can be used as an ideal media for the cathode electrode 26 27 since mc is not inherently electrically conductive it needs to be conductive for use in the electrochemical process some studies have reported mc conduction by various conjugated polymers accordingly the conductivity of mc with aniline as a bio electrode in the cr vi removal has been investigated by loloei et al 28 hosseini et al 29 used a polypyrrole mc cathode for denitrification in the electrochemical system in addition polypyrrole polymer in conducting mc and its use as an electrode in cr removal has been reported in the study of marghaki et al 30 among the conjugated polymers polyaniline pani is one of the most effective electrical conductors with advantages including high environmental stability high electrical conductivity easy synthesis and cost effectiveness 31 32 in recent years the use of minerals containing iron oxides due to the presence of ferrous ions fe2 as a reducing agent has been considered 33 in this regard the ability of iron based compounds such as magnetite 34 mackinawite 35 and pyrite 36 to reduce cr vi has been studied although these raw minerals have acceptable performance in reducing cr vi their easy oxidation and consequent decrease in their efficiency due to forming an iron hydroxide layer is the main limitation of these compounds 37 therefore the option of modifying the structure of mineral iron oxides can be used according to the researchers increasing the surface area and decreasing the particle size of natural iron based compounds through nanoparticles improves their performance in electrochemical reduction processes in this way the effective removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the electrochemical reduction process using zero valent iron nanoparticles has been reported by pavelková et al 38 the remarkable performance of magnetic nanoparticles in the electrochemical cr vi removal process has also been confirmed 30 in this study an integrated electrochemical system containing conductive mc pani composite as a biopolymer cathode and modified pyrite fes2 as a nano catalyst was used for the first time in cr vi removal in this way the synthesized mc pani cathode and nano pyrite were characterized through various analyzes the effect of operating parameters on the electrochemical reduction process was investigated moreover the mechanisms and contributions of different processes in cr vi removal were studied finally the process was assessed from the economic

laboratories iran 2 2 nano catalyst preparation in order to synthesize nano catalyst natural pyrite powder was obtained from the faculty of mining university of tehran iran the nanosizing pyrite was performed by the high energy planetary ball mill method model two cups amin asia company iran in this way large and small teflon cups had a rotation speed of 160 and 300 rpm respectively in order to complete the ball milling process time intervals of 2 4 6 and 8 h were examined in addition the ratio of ball mass to powder mass was 10 1 the obtained sample after ultrasound in ethanol 95 was washed with distilled water finally the temperature of 30 c was considered for drying the samples 2 3 synthesis of mc pani biopolymer cathode in order to prepare mc bacterial colonies of acetobacter xylinum were cultured under static conditions for this purpose hestrin schramm culture medium containing 0 5 peptone 0 27 disodium phosphate 0 115 citric acid 2 glucose 0 5 yeast extract and 2 5 agar was used after biofilm formation mc was treated with 5 sodium dodecyl sulfate and 8 naoh at 90 c for 3 h the resulting mc was washed with deionized water to neutralize its ph next the process of conducting mc with pani was performed briefly 2 ml of double distilled aniline 20 ml hcl 1 m and 20 ml isopropyl alcohol were added to a flask containing the mc and were ultrasound for 1 h then 5 g of ammonium persulfate as an oxidant was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water and added to the samples at 5 c the resulting samples were stirred at 60 rpm for 24 h finally the produced mc pani biopolymer composite was washed with distilled water to remove impurities 2 4 electrochemical reactor a circular plexiglas chamber with a volume of 250 ml was used as the electrochemical reactor in this system platinum pt and synthesized conductive mc pani were anode and cathode respectively the dimensions of the electrodes were considered 1 5 cm 1 5 cm in order to reduce the electrical resistance in the system and stabilize the mc a sheet 1 cm 1 cm of stainless steel ss was placed inside the mc pani cathode the electrodes were installed in the reactor internal distance 1 cm and connected by a direct monopolar arrangement a direct electrical current generator supplied current between the electrodes model ps 305d dazheng china 2 5 experimental initially stock cr vi solution 500 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving 0 1414 g of k2cr2o7 in 100 ml of deionized water then predetermined concentrations of cr vi 10 80 mg l 1 were provided from the stock solution in order to optimize the electrochemical

selected the ph of the samples was adjusted by adding sulfuric acid 0 1 m and sodium hydroxide 0 1 m and checked during the experiments using a digital ph meter model 3505 jenway england a ph mv temp meter measured the oxidation reduction potential orp model az 86502 taiwan after process optimization separate experiments were performed in the presence of synthesized mc pani nano pyrite and mc to determine the contribution of each to the removal of cr vi before measuring the cr vi concentration nano pyrite was separated from the solution by a centrifuge hettich germany 2 6 analysis cr vi concentration of the samples was measured by a 1 5 diphenylcarbazide colorimetric method with a spectrophotometer model uv visible 9200 china at 540 nm the concentration of aqueous ferrous ion was determined through the spectrophotometric 1 10 phenanthroline at 510 nm in addition the amount of total cr in solution cathode and catalyst was determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes 730 es varian usa at a wavelength of 267 7 nm the cr vi removal efficiency was calculated according to the following equation 1 cr vi removal cr vi 0 cr vi t cr vi 0 100 where cr vi 0 is the initial concentration of cr vi mg l 1 and cr vi t is the remaining cr vi concentration at the end of the process mg l 1 the kinetic analysis of the processes was calculated according to the following pseudo first order equation 2 ln cr vi t cr vi 0 kt where cr vi 0 is the initial cr vi concentration mg l 1 cr vi t is the residual cr vi concentration mg l 1 in the chosen time k is the rate constant min 1 and t is the reaction time min the crystal phase of mc pani biopolymer cathode and as made nano catalyst was investigated by x ray powder diffraction analysis xrd model pw1730 philips holland in this regard the scan rate of 2 theta was in the range of 10 80 with copper radiation accelerating voltage 40 kv emission current 30 ma and λ 1 54056 å fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir model avatar thermo usa in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 was used to analyze the functional groups of the synthesized cathode and the catalyst the surface morphology of the mc pani cathode and nano pyrite was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem mira iii tescan czech republic energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx analysis was used to identify elements and composition of nano pyrite catalyst moreover digimizer software was applied to determine the size distribution of as prepared nano pyrite particles the outputs of digimizer were plotted in origin software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mc pani cathode and nano catalyst 3 1 1 nano pyrite the crystalline phase and structure of pyrite before and after the nanoparticle process were characterized by xrd analysis fig 1a in the xrd diagram of raw pyrite sharp peak values were recorded at 2 theta positions of 26 69 28 44 32 99 36 99 40 79 47 39 56 24 59 04 61 79 and 64 34 which according to the jpcds no 42 1340 represent pure pyrite in the samples 39 the results of nano pyrite xrd analysis were very similar to raw pyrite accordingly diffraction peaks appeared in the 2 theta positions of 18 74 26 84 28 54 33 04 37 09 40 79 47 49 56 34 59 04 61 74 and 64 34 in xrd patterns of nano pyrite these data confirm the crystalline structure of pure pyrite in the as made nano catalyst the functional groups of as made catalyst were identified using ftir analysis fig 1b in this way the absorption bands recorded in the infrared region were considered in the raw pyrite sample the bands of 3412 1642 1145 and 1022 cm 1 belonged to the oh feso4 so and feooh functional groups respectively 40 moreover absorption bands of 598 and 830 cm 1 confirmed the presence of fes stretching vibration in the ftir analysis of nano pyrite in addition to observing the above groups other peaks also appeared in this regard peak values at 663 and 601 cm 1 were assigned to the ss group the morphology of the as made catalyst using fe sem analysis is shown in fig 1c this figure confirms the regular size distribution of nano pyrite particles after the ball milling process the results of the edx analysis to identify the components of the catalyst are illustrated in fig 1d accordingly quantitative data including weight and atomic percentages were presented in this analysis as expected iron and sulfur were the main constituents of synthesized nano pyrite the share of iron and sulfur in the atomic percentage was 34 32 and 65 68 respectively in weight percentage 47 64 iron and 52 36 sulfur were recorded in the nano pyrite structure the output histogram of the digimizer software for determining the nano pyrite particle size distribution is presented in fig 1e the observation of a large part of the as prepared catalyst particle size in the range of less than 100 nm confirms the acceptability of the pyrite nanoparticle process in this regard sizes of 20 40 nm 40 60 nm 60 80 nm and 80 100 nm comprise 23 8 41 7 22 3 and 11 9 of nano pyrite particles respectively 3 1 2 mc pani cathode fig 2a shows the mc and mc pani cathode structure based on xrd analysis in the case of mc sharp peaks appeared at 2 theta positions of 14 29 22 39 and 31 49 which confirmed the cellulosic structure of mc 30 in the xrd diagram belonging to the mc pani cathode diffraction peaks of 17 84 23 19 and 30 49 were recorded indicating that the crystalline structure of cellulose was preserved 31 in addition a sharp peak of 26 49 appeared in the xrd pattern which confirmed the presence of polyaniline in the synthesized mc pani biopolymer cathode the ftir analysis of mc pani cathode is illustrated in fig 2b in the ftir data belonging to the mc absorption bands of 3470 and 1164 cm 1 indicated hydroxyl and ether groups respectively furthermore the 2920 2855 1316 and 1366 cm 1 bands were associated with the ch2 ch group in the range of 600 to 900 cm 1 peaks belonging to the ch group appeared the results showed that the functional groups of oh ch and ch2 ch were also present in the as made mc pani cathode 28 moreover absorption bands of 1024 1242 and 1564 cm 1 were recorded in the ftir spectrum of mc pani which was related to the cn benzenoid ring group the presence of the quinoid ring cn in the mc pani cathode structure was confirmed by the appearance of the 1477 cm 1 peak the data relating to sem analysis of mc pani cathode shown in fig 2c confirm the successful stabilization of polyaniline on microbial cellulose 3 2 the influence of operational factors 3 2 1 solution ph as an operating parameter in electrochemical reduction processes ph has a significant contribution to removing pollutants in this work the influence of different ph levels on the electrochemical process in the presence of synthesized cathode and catalyst was studied the findings showed that the cr vi removal efficiencies under the conditions of 40 mg l 1 cr vi 40 ma current 1 g l 1 nacl 0 2 g l 1 nano pyrite and 60 min for ph of 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 were 41 33 34 95 26 02 22 44 and 19 48 respectively as can be seen the highest cr vi removal efficiency occurred at lower ph levels fig 3a these findings were consistent with the study of marghaki et al 30 since there are more hydrogen ions in the acidic environment and also the dominant and electrochemically active species of cr in acidic solutions is hcro4 the high cr vi reduction at ph 5 is expected according to eq 3 3 hcro 4 7 h 3 e cr 3 4 h 2 o besides the oxidation of nano pyrite causes the release of ferrous ions moreover the constant electron transfer rate at acidic ph is very high therefore electron transfer from the mc pani cathode as well as cr vi reduction in the presence of fe2 occurs significantly under acidic conditions eqs 4 and 5 in contrast excessive oxidation of nano pyrite under alkaline conditions leads to inactivation of its surface by ferrous hydroxide this phenomenon ultimately reduces the removal efficiency ruotolo and gubulin 41 and aseman bashiz and sayyaf 42 reported similar results 4 2 fes 2 7 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 fe 2 4 h 4 so 4 2 5 3 fe 2 hcro 4 7 h cr 3 3 fe 3 4 h 2 o 3 2 2 cr vi concentration since cr vi is environmentally recognized as a toxic pollutant the performance of the electrochemical system of this study was tested at different concentrations of cr vi the results showed that under conditions of ph 3 0 40 ma current 1 g l 1 nacl 0 2 g l 1 nano pyrite and 60 min with increasing cr vi concentration from 10 to 80 mg l 1 the removal efficiency decreased from 51 69 to 31 42 fig 3b this downward trend in process efficiency could be related to the occupation of active sites of nano pyrite and mc pani cathode surfaces at high amounts of cr vi considering the electrostatic adsorption of cr species such as cro4 2 or cr2o7 2 on nano pyrite and cathode by increasing the initial cr vi concentration in the solution more active sites of nano pyrite and mc pani cathode are occupied and therefore the removal efficiency decreases this statement is in line with the results of a study by diao et al 43 therefore 10 mg l 1 of cr vi was selected as the optimum value in the process 3 2 3 electric current due to the notable role of applied current in electrochemical processes the effect of electric current on removal efficiency was investigated as shown in fig 3c the cr vi removal efficiencies after 60 min at currents of 10 20 40 60 and 80 ma were 42 3 44 1 51 6 68 2 and 75 9 respectively as previously mentioned platinum was used as the anode in this study so by applying an electric current in the process the reaction of oxygen evolution occurred at the anode eq 6 44 in other words the transfer of electrons from the anode to the cathode is intensified by an increase in electric current this phenomenon promotes the cathodic reduction of cr vi eqs 3 and 7 the findings of jonoush et al study on nitrate reduction by nano magnetite immobilized on nickel foam confirm this statement 44 besides the regeneration of fe2 increases with the increasing current in the presence of iron catalysts eq 8 39 according to eq 5 applying a higher electric current in the presence of nano pyrite increased the reduction of cr vi 6 h 2 o 2 h 2 e 0 5 o 2 7 cr 2 o 7 2 7 h 2 o 6 e cr 3 14 oh 8 fe 3 e fe 2 3 2 4 nano pyrite dosage fig 3d shows the effect of five levels of nano pyrite dose on cr vi electrochemical reduction efficiency as expected higher doses of nano pyrite performed better in removing cr vi in this regard with increasing the dose of nano pyrite from 0 05 to 0 8 g l 1 the removal efficiency increased by about 40 within 60 min it is clear that in the presence of higher amounts of nano pyrite more ferrous ions are released as the cr vi reducing agent in the solution furthermore it can be assumed that the adsorption of cr vi increased with an increasing dose of nano pyrite in fact cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 species are electrostatically adsorbed by nano pyrite surface iron species feoh2 these results were consistent with diao et al study of cr vi removal in the photocatalytic process 43 3 2 5 supporting electrolyte in order to investigate the influence of electrolytes on cr vi removal sodium chloride was added to the samples in different doses as shown in fig 3e increasing the amount of nacl in the solution has a direct effect on the removal efficiency in this way by increasing the nacl dose from 0 25 to 1 g l 1 the cr vi removal efficiency increased by about 22 within 60 min as an explanation cr vi is reduced in an acidic media in the presence of chloride ions according to eq 9 moreover the improvement of cr vi removal efficiency could be related to the release of electrons due to anodic oxidation of cl after hydrolysis in an aqueous solution in contrast a slight decrease in removal efficiency was observed in nacl above 1 g l 1 a possible cause of this phenomenon could be the adsorption of large amounts of chloride ions on the surface of the electrodes and subsequently their inactivation sriram et al reported similar results in a study on the electrochemical reduction of cr vi by titania nanotubes 45 9 hcro 4 h cl cro 3 cl h 2 o 3 3 cr vi removal mechanisms in the electrochemical system containing biopolymer cathode and nano catalyst in order to provide a comprehensive discussion cr vi removal mechanisms were identified by examining the contribution of different processes under optimal conditions the results of this section are shown in fig 4 as displayed in the absence of current and mc pani cathode 0 8 g l 1 of nano pyrite removed 41 17 0 0088 min 1 of cr vi after 60 min as mentioned in the previous section one of the pathways to remove cr vi by nano pyrite is the electrostatic adsorption process of cr species on its surface moreover ferrous ions released from the oxidation of nano pyrite under acidic conditions act as cr vi reducing agents according to eqs 5 and 10 in addition nano pyrite can react directly with cr vi and lead to its reduction eq 11 this fact is mentioned in the study of diao et al 43 it is noteworthy that the disulfide s2 2 released from nano pyrite also acts as a reducing agent of cr vi in the process eqs 12 and 13 this statement has been proven in previous similar studies 46 48 however although nano pyrite alone could remove cr vi its removal efficiency was not sufficient 10 3 fe 2 cr 6 3 fe 3 cr 3 11 3 fes 2 15 hcro 4 57 h 15 cr 3 3 fe 3 6 so 4 2 36 h 2 o 12 fes 2 fe 2 s 2 2 13 hcro 4 s 2 2 3 h cr oh 3 2 s h 2 o in another part of the experiments the contribution of the mc pani cathode without the presence of catalyst and current was investigated at the same time the mc pani cathode removed 35 4 0 0072 min 1 of cr vi due to functional groups in the mc pani composite structure removing cr vi by the synthesized cathode alone was predictable in other words the amine groups in pani and the hydroxyl in mc are suitable sites for cr vi uptake in this way chromate cro4 2 is adsorbed by protonated nh groups 49 in order to evaluate the ability of the synthesized cathode mc alone was used in separate trials accordingly the cr vi removal efficiency in 60 min was observed to be 8 5 0 00148 min 1 the negligible role of mc in the adsorption of cr vi is quite clear according to previous studies when polymers are stabilized on mc the hydrophilic properties of mc are enhanced the study of qiu et al confirms this fact 49 therefore it can be concluded that the transfer of cr vi from the solution to the synthesized cathode is more efficient due to the stabilization of pani on mc and the improvement of hydrophilicity which will increase the adsorption of cr vi in the next step the mc pani cathode was tested in an electrochemical reactor without a nano catalyst based on data the removal efficiency of cr vi in 60 min was 47 6 0 0107 min 1 this increase in removal efficiency can be attributed to the electrochemical reduction process in fact electron transfer paths including mc pani pt mc pani and mc pani cr vi are created by applying electric current therefore as the transfer of electrons to cr vi intensifies the electrochemical reduction processes and subsequent removal efficiency will improve amine groups in pani have a more significant role in electron transfer to cr vi under acidic conditions this fact has been proven in the study of ruotolo and liao 50 in order to further investigate cr vi removal was measured in an electrochemical system containing ss cathode and pt anode without a catalyst this system removed 26 0 005 min 1 of cr vi cr vi removal in this system can be explained by the phenomenon of direct electrical reduction of cr vi at the ss cathode eq 3 moreover orp in the presence of ss and mc pani cathodes was measured fig 5 as expected orp amounts decreased significantly during the reaction time indicating an increase in the cr vi reduction process at the reaction time of 60 min orp amounts in the presence of ss and mc pani were recorded as 395 and 632 mv respectively these results confirm the effective performance of the mc pani cathode in the electrochemical reduction process of cr vi as shown in fig 4 the highest cr vi removal 98 6 0 071 min 1 was recorded by the electrochemical system containing the mc pani cathode and nano pyrite the synergistic effect and cooperation between the cathode and the nano catalyst in this system have occurred dramatically indeed with the simultaneous presence of nano pyrite and mc pani cathode in the electrochemical reactor the aforementioned mechanisms occur together in solution and the cr vi removal efficiency increases furthermore the electric current accelerates the cycle of iron ion regeneration as a reducing agent eqs 14 16 apart from this it has been proven that chromate and dichromate esters have more significant redox potential than cr 51 since the amine and hydroxyl groups can form ester groups cr vi combined with the mc pani can be converted to chromate and dichromate esters and increase its reduction finally total cr cr vi and cr iii was measured at the end of the electrochemical process in the presence of mc pani cathode and catalyst under optimal conditions the output data from the icp oes analysis showed that the amount of total cr after 60 min in solution was 0 11 mg l 1 this residual amount can be attributed to cr iii because the results showed that cr vi was almost completely removed in addition the total cr values based on the weight percentage in the mc pani cathode 1 1 g and nano pyrite 0 08 g were 3 9 and 5 4 respectively these results suggested that an electrochemical reduction adsorption process occurred in the cr removal path first the electrochemical reduction of cr vi occurs and then the remaining total cr especially cr iii is adsorbed on the cathode and the catalyst a study by qiu et al 49 on polyaniline coating with various substrates for hexavalent chromium removal confirms this statement however the electrochemical reduction has been the dominant process in cr vi removal 14 fe 2 o 2 fe 3 o 2 15 fe 3 o 2 fe 2 h o 2 16 3 o 2 cr 6 cr 3 3 o 2 3 4 cost effectiveness evaluation the electrochemical system of this research was evaluated in terms of two important economic factors including energy consumption and cathode and catalyst recyclability fig 6 for this purpose five runs were considered for mc pani cathode and nano catalyst recycling the results showed that the electrochemical reactor containing the mc pani and nano pyrite successfully reduced cr vi even after five consecutive runs in this regard the cr vi removal efficiency after recycling the cathode and catalyst five times was 71 1 since the formation of sludge in water and wastewater treatment processes leads to increased operating costs the lack of production of iron sludge and the reusability of nano pyrite are the economic options of this catalyst in the electrochemical reduction of cr vi besides measuring the concentration of ferrous ions released from nano pyrite after five runs confirmed a direct correlation between the amount of fe2 and cr vi removal in this way the amount of fe2 decreased by 2 3 mg l 1 and at the same time the removal of cr vi decreased by 27 5 fig 6 it should be noted that due to the agglomeration and decrease of catalytic activity of nano pyrite surface 39 42 the efficiency of cr vi removal in successive runs had a relative decrease however nano pyrite was very successful in supplying fe2 even after five recycling in the case of the mc pani cathode the occupation of its surface by chromium and the decrease of electron transfer may have reduced the removal efficiency after successive recycling the following equations were used to calculate electrical energy consumption eec and energy efficiency ee of the process 17 eec wh l 1 u i t v where u is the voltage v i is the electrical current a t is the time h and v is the solution volume l 18 ee mg wh 1 m u i t where m is the removed cr vi mg u is the voltage v i is the current a and t is the time h the function of ss and mc pani cathodes was examined in the presence and absence of nano pyrite for energy consumption as shown in table 1 the presence of nano pyrite has improved the process energy consumption in this way the mc pani cathode with nano pyrite recorded the highest energy efficiency 25 15 mg wh 1 on the other hand although ss cathode consumed little electrical energy 2 9 wh l 1 its energy efficiency was unacceptable however the performance of the electrochemical reduction process in this study was entirely economically satisfactory tables 2 and 3 4 conclusions in this work the performance of a novel integrated electrochemical system containing conductive mc pani composite as cathode and nano pyrite as catalyst in cr vi removal was investigated in this regard catalyst dose electrolyte dose applied current and reaction time had a direct effect on cr vi removal while the influence of increasing ph and cr vi concentration on the removal efficiency was inhibitory the first order kinetic model with r2 0 96 was fitted for the electrochemical reduction process of cr vi the results showed that different electron transfer pathways are created in the simultaneous presence of mc pani cathode nano pyrite and electric current promoting cr vi reduction based on ftir analysis pani was successfully stabilized on mc and due to the presence of nh and oh groups in the as made cathode structure suitable sites for adsorption and cathodic cr vi reduction were provided moreover it was suggested that fe2 and s2 2 released from nano pyrite could have a synergistic effect on removal efficiency the data confirmed the remarkable ability of the electrochemical process after five cathode and catalyst recovery times furthermore the simultaneous presence of nano pyrite and mc pani decreased energy consumption in sum the performance of the innovative combined mc pani cathode and nano pyrite catalyst electrochemical system in cr vi removal was quite promising in terms of economics and efficiency declaration of

13249,in this study microbial cellulose mc was conductive by polyaniline pani stabilization and used as a biopolymer cathode for the first time in the presence of nano pyrite fes2 for electrochemical removal of hexavalent chromium cr vi characterization of mc pani and nano pyrite was conducted by fe sem ftir edx and xrd analyzes according to the results nano pyrite mc and mc pani removed 41 17 8 54 and 35 4 of 10 mg l 1 cr vi within 60 min without the electric current respectively at the same time the highest cr vi removal rate 98 6 was observed in the electrochemical process 80 ma with the simultaneous presence of mc pani cathode and nano pyrite the study of mechanisms showed that creating different electron transfer pathways between mc pani nano pyrite and cr vi improves the removal efficiency in this system the output data from the icp oes analysis showed that the amount of total cr remaining in the solution was 0 11 mg l 1 at the end of the process furthermore the total cr values based on the weight percentage in the mc pani cathode 1 1 g and nano pyrite 0 08 g were 3 9 and 5 4 respectively these results suggested that an electrochemical reduction adsorption process occurred in the cr removal path however redox potential measurements 383 to 632 mv showed that the dominant process in cr vi removal was electrochemical reduction the recording of 71 1 cr vi removal after five runs confirmed the remarkable reusability of the synthesized cathode and catalyst this study introduced an efficient sustainable and economical integrated electrochemical system for cr vi removal through synergistic effect and cooperation between the mc pani cathode and the nano pyrite catalyst graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrochemical chromium microbial cellulose polyaniline cathode nano pyrite 1 introduction today the human lifestyle depends on industrial activities from the point of view of environmental engineering the main consequence of industrialization is the entry of various hazardous pollutants into the environment 1 2 heavy metals are considered as environmental pollutants due to their stability toxicity non degradability carcinogenic and teratogenic 3 4 chromium cr is one of the most dangerous heavy metals that enter the environment and water resources from various industries such as paint processing leather tanning textile steel fabrication electroplating and wood preservation 4 6 although cr exists in different valence states its two states trivalent and hexavalent are more environmentally important 7 long term exposure to hexavalent chromium cr vi can cause skin problems bronchitis kidney and liver damage respiratory problems and gastrointestinal cancer 8 in contrast cr iii is generally insoluble in water and its toxicity is 102 103 times lower than cr vi 9 therefore the maximum contaminant levels of cr vi in drinking water set by the environmental protection agency and world health organization are 0 1 mg l 1 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively 10 techniques commonly for reducing cr vi to cr iii are microbial activities 11 precipitation 12 ion exchange 13 membrane filtration 14 electrochemical reduction 15 and adsorption 16 the electrochemical reduction has been considered due to advantages such as the use of electrons as a clean agent the safety of production and automation capability 17 18 in the process of cr vi electrochemical reduction the transfer of electrons from the cathode to cr causes the reduction of cr vi to cr iii 19 in previous studies metal based cathodes have been used repeatedly for electrochemical reduction of cr vi 20 23 since the use of these cathodes has disadvantages such as the high cost of metals and inactivation of the surface electrode by cr iii precipitate the application of alternative cathodes has been considered 24 25 microbial cellulose mc is a carbohydrate biopolymer that due to its high tensile strength low weight high durability and stability significant water uptake capacity and high degree of porosity can be used as an ideal media for the cathode electrode 26 27 since mc is not inherently electrically conductive it needs to be conductive for use in the electrochemical process some studies have reported mc conduction by various conjugated polymers accordingly the conductivity of mc with aniline as a bio electrode in the cr vi removal has been investigated by loloei et al 28 hosseini et al 29 used a polypyrrole mc cathode for denitrification in the electrochemical system in addition polypyrrole polymer in conducting mc and its use as an electrode in cr removal has been reported in the study of marghaki et al 30 among the conjugated polymers polyaniline pani is one of the most effective electrical conductors with advantages including high environmental stability high electrical conductivity easy synthesis and cost effectiveness 31 32 in recent years the use of minerals containing iron oxides due to the presence of ferrous ions fe2 as a reducing agent has been considered 33 in this regard the ability of iron based compounds such as magnetite 34 mackinawite 35 and pyrite 36 to reduce cr vi has been studied although these raw minerals have acceptable performance in reducing cr vi their easy oxidation and consequent decrease in their efficiency due to forming an iron hydroxide layer is the main limitation of these compounds 37 therefore the option of modifying the structure of mineral iron oxides can be used according to the researchers increasing the surface area and decreasing the particle size of natural iron based compounds through nanoparticles improves their performance in electrochemical reduction processes in this way the effective removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the electrochemical reduction process using zero valent iron nanoparticles has been reported by pavelková et al 38 the remarkable performance of magnetic nanoparticles in the electrochemical cr vi removal process has also been confirmed 30 in this study an integrated electrochemical system containing conductive mc pani composite as a biopolymer cathode and modified pyrite fes2 as a nano catalyst was used for the first time in cr vi removal in this way the synthesized mc pani cathode and nano pyrite were characterized through various analyzes the effect of operating parameters on the electrochemical reduction process was investigated moreover the mechanisms and contributions of different processes in cr vi removal were studied finally the process was assessed from the economic

performed by the high energy planetary ball mill method model two cups amin asia company iran in this way large and small teflon cups had a rotation speed of 160 and 300 rpm respectively in order to complete the ball milling process time intervals of 2 4 6 and 8 h were examined in addition the ratio of ball mass to powder mass was 10 1 the obtained sample after ultrasound in ethanol 95 was washed with distilled water finally the temperature of 30 c was considered for drying the samples 2 3 synthesis of mc pani biopolymer cathode in order to prepare mc bacterial colonies of acetobacter xylinum

persulfate as an oxidant was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water and added to the samples at 5 c the resulting samples were stirred at 60 rpm for 24 h finally the produced mc pani biopolymer composite was washed with distilled water to remove impurities 2 4 electrochemical reactor a circular plexiglas chamber with a volume of 250 ml was used as the electrochemical reactor in this system platinum pt and synthesized conductive mc pani were anode and cathode respectively the dimensions of the electrodes were considered 1 5 cm 1 5 cm in order to reduce the electrical resistance in the system and stabilize the mc a sheet 1 cm 1 cm of stainless steel ss was placed inside the mc pani cathode the electrodes were installed in the reactor internal distance 1 cm and connected by a direct monopolar arrangement a direct electrical current generator supplied current between the electrodes model ps 305d dazheng china 2 5 experimental initially stock cr vi solution 500 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving 0 1414 g of k2cr2o7 in 100 ml of deionized water then predetermined concentrations of cr vi 10 80 mg l 1 were provided from the stock solution in order to optimize the electrochemical

meter measured the oxidation reduction potential orp model az 86502 taiwan after process optimization separate experiments were performed in the presence of synthesized mc pani nano pyrite and mc to determine the contribution of each to the removal of cr vi before measuring the cr vi concentration nano pyrite was separated from the solution by a centrifuge hettich germany 2 6 analysis cr vi concentration of the samples was measured by a 1 5 diphenylcarbazide colorimetric method with a spectrophotometer model uv visible 9200 china at 540 nm the concentration of aqueous ferrous ion was determined through the spectrophotometric 1 10 phenanthroline at 510 nm in addition the amount of total cr in solution cathode and catalyst was determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes 730 es varian usa at a wavelength of 267 7 nm the cr vi removal efficiency was calculated according to the following equation 1 cr vi removal cr vi 0 cr vi t cr vi 0 100 where cr vi 0 is the initial concentration of cr vi mg l 1 and cr vi t is the remaining cr vi concentration at the end of the process mg l 1 the kinetic analysis of the processes was calculated according to the following pseudo first order equation 2 ln cr vi t cr vi 0 kt where cr vi 0 is the initial cr vi concentration mg l 1 cr vi t is the residual cr vi concentration mg l 1 in the chosen time k is the rate constant min 1 and t is the reaction time min the crystal phase of mc pani biopolymer cathode and as made nano catalyst was investigated by x ray powder diffraction analysis xrd model pw1730 philips holland in this regard the scan rate of 2 theta was in the range of 10 80 with copper radiation accelerating voltage 40 kv emission current 30 ma and λ 1 54056 å fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir model avatar thermo usa in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 was used to analyze the functional groups of the synthesized cathode and the catalyst the surface morphology of the mc

elements and composition of nano pyrite catalyst moreover digimizer software was applied to determine the size distribution of as prepared nano pyrite particles the outputs of digimizer were plotted in origin software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mc pani cathode and nano catalyst 3 1 1 nano pyrite the crystalline phase and structure of pyrite before and after the nanoparticle process were characterized by xrd analysis fig 1a in the xrd diagram of raw pyrite sharp peak values were recorded at 2 theta positions of 26 69 28 44 32 99 36 99 40 79 47 39 56 24 59 04 61 79 and 64 34 which according to the jpcds no 42 1340 represent pure pyrite in the samples 39 the results of nano pyrite xrd analysis were very similar to raw pyrite accordingly diffraction peaks appeared in the 2 theta positions of 18 74 26 84 28 54 33 04 37 09 40 79 47 49 56 34 59 04 61 74 and 64 34 in xrd patterns of nano pyrite these data confirm the crystalline structure of pure pyrite in the as made nano catalyst the functional groups of as made catalyst were identified using ftir analysis fig 1b in this way the absorption bands recorded in the infrared region were considered in the raw pyrite sample the bands of 3412 1642 1145 and 1022 cm 1 belonged to the oh feso4 so and feooh functional groups respectively 40 moreover absorption bands of 598 and 830 cm 1 confirmed the presence of fes stretching vibration in the ftir analysis of nano pyrite in addition to observing the above groups other peaks also appeared in this regard peak values at 663 and 601 cm 1 were assigned to the ss group the morphology of the as made catalyst using fe sem analysis is shown in fig 1c this figure confirms the regular size distribution of nano pyrite particles after the ball milling process the results of the edx analysis to identify the components of the catalyst are illustrated in fig 1d accordingly quantitative data including weight and atomic percentages were presented in this analysis as expected iron and sulfur were the main constituents of synthesized nano pyrite the share of iron and sulfur in the atomic percentage was 34 32 and 65 68 respectively in weight percentage 47 64 iron and 52 36 sulfur were recorded in the nano pyrite structure the output histogram of the digimizer software for determining the nano pyrite particle size distribution is presented in fig 1e the observation of a large part of the as prepared catalyst particle size in the range of less than 100 nm confirms the acceptability of the pyrite nanoparticle process in this regard sizes of 20 40 nm 40 60 nm 60 80 nm and 80 100 nm comprise 23 8 41 7 22 3 and 11 9 of nano pyrite particles respectively 3 1 2 mc pani cathode fig 2a shows the mc and mc pani cathode structure based on xrd analysis in the case of mc sharp peaks appeared at 2 theta positions of 14 29 22 39 and 31 49 which confirmed the cellulosic structure of mc 30 in the xrd diagram belonging to the mc pani cathode diffraction peaks of 17 84 23 19 and 30 49 were recorded indicating that the crystalline structure of cellulose was preserved 31 in addition a sharp peak of 26 49 appeared in the xrd pattern which confirmed the presence of polyaniline in the synthesized mc pani biopolymer cathode the ftir analysis of mc pani cathode is illustrated in fig 2b in the ftir data belonging to the mc absorption bands of 3470 and 1164 cm 1 indicated hydroxyl and ether groups respectively furthermore the 2920 2855 1316 and 1366 cm 1 bands were associated with the ch2 ch group in the range of 600 to 900 cm 1 peaks belonging to the ch group appeared the results showed that the functional groups of oh ch and ch2 ch were also present in the as made mc pani cathode 28 moreover absorption bands of 1024 1242 and 1564 cm 1 were recorded in the ftir spectrum of mc pani which was related to the cn benzenoid ring group the presence of the quinoid ring cn in the mc pani cathode structure was confirmed by the appearance of the 1477 cm 1 peak the data relating to sem analysis of mc pani cathode shown in fig 2c confirm the successful stabilization of polyaniline on microbial cellulose 3 2 the influence of operational factors 3 2 1 solution ph as an operating parameter in electrochemical reduction processes ph has a significant contribution to removing pollutants in this work the influence of different ph levels on the electrochemical process in the presence of synthesized cathode and catalyst was studied the findings showed that the cr vi removal efficiencies under the conditions of 40 mg l 1 cr vi 40 ma current 1 g l 1 nacl 0 2 g l 1 nano pyrite and 60 min for ph of 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 were 41 33 34 95 26 02 22 44 and 19 48 respectively as can be seen the highest cr vi removal efficiency occurred at lower ph levels fig 3a these findings were consistent with the study of marghaki et al 30 since there are more hydrogen ions in the acidic environment and also the dominant and electrochemically active species of cr in acidic solutions is hcro4 the high cr vi reduction at ph 5 is expected according to eq 3 3 hcro 4 7 h 3 e cr 3 4 h 2 o besides the oxidation of nano pyrite causes the release of ferrous ions moreover the constant electron transfer rate at acidic ph is very high therefore electron transfer from the mc pani cathode as well as cr vi reduction in the presence of fe2 occurs significantly under acidic conditions eqs 4 and 5 in contrast excessive oxidation of nano pyrite under alkaline conditions leads to inactivation of its surface by ferrous hydroxide this phenomenon ultimately reduces the removal efficiency ruotolo and gubulin 41 and aseman bashiz and sayyaf 42 reported similar results 4 2 fes 2 7 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 fe 2 4 h 4 so 4 2 5 3 fe 2 hcro 4 7 h cr 3 3 fe 3 4 h 2 o 3 2 2 cr vi concentration since cr vi is environmentally recognized as a toxic pollutant the performance of the electrochemical system of this study was tested at different concentrations of cr vi the results showed that under conditions of ph 3 0 40 ma current 1 g l 1 nacl 0 2 g l 1 nano pyrite and 60 min with increasing cr vi concentration from 10 to 80 mg l 1 the removal efficiency decreased from 51 69 to 31 42 fig 3b this downward trend in process efficiency could be related to the occupation of active sites of nano pyrite and mc pani cathode surfaces at high amounts of cr vi considering the electrostatic adsorption of cr species such as cro4 2 or cr2o7 2 on nano pyrite and cathode by increasing the initial cr vi concentration in the solution more active sites of nano pyrite and mc pani cathode are occupied and therefore the removal efficiency decreases this statement is in line with the results of a study by diao et al 43 therefore 10 mg l 1 of cr vi was selected as the optimum value in the process 3 2 3 electric current due to the notable role of applied current in electrochemical processes the effect of electric current on removal efficiency was investigated as shown in fig 3c the cr vi removal efficiencies after 60 min at currents of 10 20 40 60 and 80 ma were 42 3 44 1 51 6 68 2 and 75 9 respectively as previously mentioned platinum was used as the anode in this study so by applying an electric current in the process the reaction of oxygen evolution occurred at the anode eq 6 44 in other words the transfer of electrons from the anode to the cathode is intensified by an increase in electric current this phenomenon promotes the cathodic reduction of cr vi eqs 3 and 7 the findings of jonoush et al study on nitrate reduction by nano magnetite immobilized on nickel foam confirm this statement 44 besides the regeneration of fe2 increases with the increasing current in the presence of iron catalysts eq 8 39 according to eq 5 applying a higher electric current in the presence of nano pyrite increased the reduction of cr vi 6 h 2 o 2 h 2 e 0 5 o 2 7 cr 2 o 7 2 7 h 2 o 6 e cr 3 14 oh 8 fe 3 e fe 2 3 2 4 nano pyrite dosage fig 3d shows the effect of five levels of nano pyrite dose on cr vi electrochemical reduction efficiency as expected higher doses of nano pyrite performed better in removing cr vi in this regard with increasing the dose of nano pyrite from 0 05 to 0 8 g l 1 the removal efficiency increased by about 40 within 60 min it is clear that in the presence of higher amounts of nano pyrite more ferrous ions are released as the cr vi reducing agent in the solution furthermore it can be assumed that the adsorption of cr vi increased with an increasing dose of nano pyrite in fact cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 species are electrostatically adsorbed by nano pyrite surface iron species feoh2 these results were consistent with diao et al study of cr vi removal in the photocatalytic process 43 3 2 5 supporting electrolyte in order to investigate the influence of electrolytes on cr vi removal sodium chloride was added to the samples in different doses as shown in fig 3e increasing the amount of nacl in the solution has a direct effect on the removal efficiency in this way by increasing the nacl dose from 0 25 to 1 g l 1 the cr vi removal efficiency increased by about 22 within 60 min as an explanation cr vi is reduced in an acidic media in the presence of chloride ions according to eq 9 moreover the improvement of cr vi removal efficiency could be related to the release of electrons due to anodic oxidation of cl after hydrolysis in an aqueous solution in contrast a slight decrease in removal efficiency was observed in nacl above 1 g l 1 a possible cause of this phenomenon could be the adsorption of large amounts of chloride ions on the surface of the electrodes and subsequently their inactivation sriram et al reported similar results in a study on the electrochemical reduction of cr vi by titania nanotubes 45 9 hcro 4 h cl cro 3 cl h 2 o 3 3 cr vi removal mechanisms in the electrochemical system containing biopolymer cathode and nano catalyst in order to provide a comprehensive discussion cr vi removal mechanisms were identified by examining the contribution of different processes under optimal conditions the results of this section are shown in fig 4 as displayed in the absence of current and mc pani cathode 0 8 g l 1 of nano pyrite removed 41 17 0 0088 min 1 of cr vi after 60 min as mentioned in the previous section one of the pathways to remove cr vi by nano pyrite is the electrostatic adsorption process of cr species on its surface moreover ferrous ions released from the oxidation of nano pyrite under acidic conditions act as cr vi reducing agents according to eqs 5 and 10 in addition nano pyrite can react directly with cr vi and lead to its reduction eq 11 this fact is mentioned in the study of diao et al 43 it is noteworthy that the disulfide s2 2 released from nano pyrite also acts as a reducing agent of cr vi in the process eqs 12 and 13 this statement has been proven in previous similar studies 46 48 however although nano pyrite alone could remove cr vi its removal efficiency was not sufficient 10 3 fe 2 cr 6 3 fe 3 cr 3 11 3 fes 2 15 hcro 4 57 h 15 cr 3 3 fe 3 6 so 4 2 36 h 2 o 12 fes 2 fe 2 s 2 2 13 hcro 4 s 2 2 3 h cr oh 3 2 s h 2 o in another part of the experiments the contribution of the mc pani cathode without the presence of catalyst and current was investigated at the same time the mc pani cathode removed 35 4 0 0072 min 1 of cr vi due to functional groups in the mc pani composite structure removing cr vi by the synthesized cathode alone was predictable in other words the amine groups in pani and the hydroxyl in mc are suitable sites for cr vi uptake in this way chromate cro4 2 is adsorbed by protonated nh groups 49 in order to evaluate the ability of the synthesized cathode mc alone was used in separate trials accordingly the cr vi removal efficiency in 60 min was observed to be 8 5 0 00148 min 1 the negligible role of mc in the adsorption of cr vi is quite clear according to previous studies when polymers are stabilized on mc the hydrophilic properties of mc are enhanced the study of qiu et al confirms this fact 49 therefore it can be concluded that the transfer of cr vi from the solution to the synthesized cathode is more efficient due to the stabilization of pani on mc and the improvement of hydrophilicity which will increase the adsorption of cr vi in the next step the mc pani cathode was tested in an electrochemical reactor without a nano catalyst based on data the removal efficiency of cr vi in 60 min was 47 6 0 0107 min 1 this increase in removal efficiency can be attributed to the electrochemical reduction process in fact electron transfer paths including mc pani pt mc pani and mc pani cr vi are created by applying electric current therefore as the transfer of electrons to cr vi intensifies the electrochemical reduction processes and subsequent removal efficiency will improve amine groups in pani have a more significant role in electron transfer to cr vi under acidic conditions this fact has been proven in the study of ruotolo and liao 50 in order to further investigate cr vi removal was measured in an electrochemical system containing ss cathode and pt anode without a catalyst this system removed 26 0 005 min 1 of cr vi cr vi removal in this system can be explained by the phenomenon of direct electrical reduction of cr vi at the ss cathode eq 3 moreover orp in the presence of ss and mc pani cathodes was measured fig 5 as expected orp amounts decreased significantly during the reaction time indicating an increase in the cr vi reduction process at the reaction time of 60 min orp amounts in the presence of ss and mc pani were recorded as 395 and 632 mv respectively these results confirm the effective performance of the mc pani cathode in the electrochemical reduction process of cr vi as shown in fig 4 the highest cr vi removal 98 6 0 071 min 1 was recorded by the electrochemical system containing the mc pani cathode and nano pyrite the synergistic effect and cooperation between the cathode and the nano catalyst in this system have occurred dramatically indeed with the simultaneous presence of nano pyrite and mc pani cathode in the electrochemical reactor the aforementioned mechanisms occur together in solution and the cr vi removal efficiency increases furthermore the electric current accelerates the cycle of iron ion regeneration as a reducing agent eqs 14 16 apart from this it has been proven that chromate and dichromate esters have more significant redox potential than cr 51 since the amine and hydroxyl groups can form ester groups cr vi combined with the mc pani can be converted to chromate and dichromate esters and increase its reduction finally total cr cr vi and cr iii was measured at the end of the electrochemical process in the presence of mc pani cathode and catalyst under optimal conditions the output data from the icp oes analysis showed that the amount of total cr after 60 min in solution was 0 11 mg l 1 this residual amount can be attributed to cr iii because the results showed that cr vi was almost completely removed in addition the total cr values based on the weight percentage in the mc pani cathode 1 1 g and nano pyrite 0 08 g were 3 9 and 5 4 respectively these results suggested that an electrochemical reduction adsorption process occurred in the cr removal path first the electrochemical reduction of cr vi occurs and then the remaining total cr especially cr iii is adsorbed on the cathode and the catalyst a study by qiu et al 49 on polyaniline coating with various substrates for hexavalent chromium removal confirms this statement however the electrochemical reduction has been the dominant process in cr vi removal 14 fe 2 o 2 fe 3 o 2 15 fe 3 o 2 fe 2 h o 2 16 3 o 2 cr 6 cr 3 3 o 2 3 4 cost effectiveness evaluation the electrochemical system of this research was evaluated in terms of two important economic factors including energy consumption and cathode and catalyst recyclability fig 6 for this purpose five runs were considered for mc pani cathode and nano catalyst recycling the results showed that the electrochemical reactor containing the mc pani and nano pyrite successfully reduced cr vi even after five consecutive runs in this regard the cr vi removal efficiency after recycling the cathode and catalyst five times was 71 1 since the formation of sludge in water and wastewater treatment processes leads to increased operating costs the lack of production of iron sludge and the reusability of nano pyrite are the economic options of this catalyst in the electrochemical reduction of cr vi besides measuring the concentration of ferrous ions released from nano pyrite after five runs confirmed a direct correlation between the amount of fe2 and cr vi removal in this way the amount of fe2 decreased by 2 3 mg l 1 and at the same time the removal of cr vi decreased by 27 5 fig 6 it should be noted that due to the agglomeration and decrease of catalytic activity of nano pyrite surface 39 42 the efficiency of cr vi removal in successive runs had a relative decrease however nano pyrite was very successful in supplying fe2 even after five recycling in the case of the mc pani cathode the occupation of its surface by chromium and the decrease of electron transfer may have reduced the removal efficiency after successive recycling the following equations were used to calculate electrical energy consumption eec and energy efficiency ee of the process 17 eec wh l 1 u i t v where u is the voltage v i is the electrical current a t is the time h and v is the solution volume l 18 ee mg wh 1 m u i t where m is the removed cr vi mg u is the voltage v i is the current a and t is the time h the function of ss and mc pani cathodes was examined in the presence and absence of nano pyrite for energy consumption as shown in table 1 the presence of nano pyrite has improved the process energy consumption in this way the mc pani cathode with nano pyrite recorded the highest energy efficiency 25 15 mg wh 1 on the other hand although ss cathode consumed little electrical energy 2 9 wh l 1 its energy efficiency was unacceptable however the performance of the electrochemical reduction process in this study was entirely economically satisfactory tables 2 and 3 4 conclusions in this work the performance of a novel integrated electrochemical system containing conductive mc pani composite as cathode and nano pyrite as catalyst in cr vi removal was investigated in this regard catalyst dose electrolyte dose applied current and reaction time had a direct effect on cr vi removal while the influence of increasing ph and cr vi concentration on the removal efficiency was inhibitory the first order kinetic model with r2 0 96 was fitted for the electrochemical reduction process of cr vi the results showed that different electron transfer pathways are created in the simultaneous presence of mc pani cathode nano pyrite and electric current promoting cr vi reduction based on ftir analysis pani was successfully stabilized on mc and due to the presence of nh and oh groups in the as made cathode structure suitable sites for adsorption and cathodic cr vi reduction were provided moreover it was suggested that fe2 and s2 2 released from nano pyrite could have a synergistic effect on removal efficiency the data confirmed the remarkable ability of the electrochemical process after five cathode and catalyst recovery times furthermore the simultaneous presence of nano pyrite and mc pani decreased energy consumption in sum the performance of the innovative combined mc pani cathode and nano pyrite catalyst electrochemical system in cr vi removal was quite promising in terms of economics and efficiency declaration of
