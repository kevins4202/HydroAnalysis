17270,recovering energy from wastewater in addition to its treatment is a hot trend in the new concept of water resource recovery facility wrrf high rate systems operating at low solid retention time srt have been proposed to meet this challenge in this paper the integration of enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in an anaerobic aerobic continuous high rate system a stage ebpr was evaluated successful p and cod removal were obtained operating at srt 6 5 and 4 days treating real wastewater while a further decrease to 3 days led to biomass washout the best steady state operational conditions were obtained at srt 4d with high removal percentage of p 94 5 and cod 96 3 and without detecting nitrification cod mineralization could be reduced to 30 while 64 of the entering carbon could be diverted as biomass to energy recovery regarding nitrogen about 69 1 of the influent n was left as ammonium in the effluent with 30 used for biomass growth the aerobic reactor could be operated at low dissolved oxygen do 0 5 mg l which is beneficial to decrease energy requirements biochemical methane potential bmp tests showed better productivity for the anaerobic sludge than the aerobic sludge with an optimal bmp of 296 2 ml ch4 gvss fish analysis at srt 4d revealed a high abundance of accumulibacter 33 13 and lower proportion of gao competibacter 3 0 0 3

retention time srt 1 introduction wastewater treatment using conventional activated sludge systems has been beneficial for the whole society and environment for over 100 years this technology is robust and provides good effluent quality at the expense of high operating costs due to aeration and sludge management high organic matter losses due to mineralization and large areas for settlers to retain flocculent solids mccarty et al 2011 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however these conventional systems may not recover the potential energy present in the organic compounds of wastewater akanyeti et al 2010 the influent organic matter contains a significant amount of chemical energy stored in the chemical bonds around 1 9 kwh m3 bowen et al 2014 heidrich et al 2011 mccarty et al 2011 and the amount of energy required for aeration in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps is usually in the range 0 3 0 7 kwh m3 of wastewater jimenez et al 2015 shizas and bagley 2004 therefore there is a great potential for improving energy recovery in classical wastewater treatment systems current research focuses on proposing new wwtp configurations to recover resources i e nutrients and energy from industrial urban wastewater which represents a step forward from conventional treatment the idea is to transform wwtps into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs the integration of the bio refinery concept could be beneficial to solve the current issues of energy inefficient wastewater treatment processes and resource shortage under a circular economy scenario sheik et al 2014 one of the golden rules of this innovative concept is to promote the diversion of organic matter to anaerobic digestion to produce biogas the most common way is to send the primary and secondary sludge from wrrfs to the anaerobic digester to produce methane 5 7 kwh m3 some researchers have suggested that wrrfs could be transformed into self sustained energy systems by maximizing the organic matter fed to the anaerobic digester kartal et al 2010 verstraete and vlaeminck 2011 in this sense the most recent configurations have revisited an old concept the two stage a b configuration böhnke 1977 böhnke et al 1998 the a stage is in charge of organic matter removal while the b stage faces autotrophic nitrogen removal since the wastewater entering to the b stage should not contain organic matter the a stage employs a high rate activated sludge hras aiming at removing particulate and soluble organics through a combination of adsorption and degradation thus carbon is redirected and concentrated rather than mineralised and the solids produced are diverted to energy recovery through anaerobic digestion hras systems allow to recover an important fraction of the chemical oxygen demand cod in the influent typically in the range 50 80 sancho et al 2019 although new processes as the alternating activated adsorption are being developed to increase its performance wett et al 2020 hence maximization of energy recovery could be obtained by applying hras systems with a relative low srt between 0 5 and 4 days jimenez et al 2015 moreover this stage acts as a shock absorber of unexpected toxic loads that could be very detrimental to the b stage smitshuijzen et al 2016 besides organic matter and nitrogen the discharge of the phosphorus p contained in wastewater into the aquatic environment can lead to eutrophication which is detrimental to both aquatic life and water supply for domestic and industrial fields hanhoun et al 2011 however the fate of phosphorus in the a b configuration has not yet been fully studied and chemical precipitation in the tertiary step is currently the most typical option enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr has been widely used to remove p and organic matter from wastewater for some decades in ebpr systems polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao have abilities to store polyhydroxyalkanoate pha anaerobically from organic matter mainly volatile fatty acids vfa and to accumulate p as polyphosphate under anoxic or aerobic conditions if ebpr needs to be integrated into an a stage system an additional anaerobic reactor has to be included building an integrated a stage ebpr system is not only interesting for achieving simultaneous biological c and p removal and thus no further chemical precipitation of p would be required but also enables the application of other novel advanced configurations on the one hand an a stage ebpr system would be suitable for anaerobic wastage as biomass purged from the anaerobic reactor would have a high pha content and therefore a high potential for biogas production and energy recovery chan et al 2020a guisasola et al 2019 huda et al 2013 on the other hand a stage ebpr systems would be suitable for the implementation of mainstream p recovery strategies for instance by precipitating p from a stream from the anaerobic reactor acevedo et al 2015 guisasola et al 2019 larriba et al 2020 law and pagilla 2018 then pao are excellent candidates for decreasing the degree of organic matter mineralization for maximizing the amount of biogas produced during anaerobic digestion and for improving plant economics hence it would be extremely interesting to design and to operate ebpr systems i e anaerobic aerobic a o systems at very low srt however an a stage ebpr system requires the inclusion of an anaerobic phase in the a stage and operating at srts higher than those without ebpr a recent full scale study at different srts has shown a clear correlation between the ebpr performance and the srt achieving better and more consistent p removal at srt below 10 days with the optimum at srt 7d onnis hayden et al 2019 some studies have focused on integrating ebpr in short srt systems for removing carbon and p in view of energy efficiency and sustainability of the treatment process ge et al 2013 found more than 80 reduction in cod and p with a high rate sequencing batch reactor sbr process srt 2 3 d chan et al 2017 operated sbrs with ebpr for treating synthetic wastewater with successful results with a srt down to 3 6 d at 25ºc valverde pérez et al 2016 investigated the high rate ebpr system with a sbr and found that phosphate could be effectively removed with mitigated nitrification at the lowest srt 3 d on the other hand one of the most common causes of ebpr failure is the presence of nitrate under anaerobic conditions due to the occurrence of nitrification in the aerobic reactor recycling of nitrate to the anaerobic reactor can result in denitrifiers using part of the carbon source and thus outcompeting pao nitrification could be suppressed at low srt and low do however these two strategies can also affect pao growth and thus a compromise scenario must be found choosing a srt high enough for the pao growth and low enough for more efficient carbon removal and for the washout of nitrifiers moreover the fraction of vfa in the influent wastewater is also a key factor since a low vfa content would require a high anaerobic residence time to convert the organic matter into vfa considering this background this work faces the integration of ebpr in a continuous a stage system treating real wastewater the main objectives of this work are i to explore the feasibility of the continuous a stage ebpr system ii to investigate the minimum srt to maintain successful organic matter and p removal in the long term iii to prevent nitrification under low srt conditions without the addition of any nitrification inhibitor and iv to gain insight into the possibility of purging from the anaerobic reactor of this novel configuration in view of harvesting biomass with high pha content to maximize biogas production 2 materials and methods 2 1 equipment the pilot plant used figure s1 consisted of two continuous stirred tank reactors cstr one anaerobic v 19l and one aerobic v 23l and a settler 25l the wastewater used was the primary settler effluent of the wwtp of manresa barcelona spain the average characteristics of the raw wastewater are shown in table 1 because of the low cod concentration additional propionic acid was added from a concentrated solution 2300 mgcod l to increase the cod concentration of the influent up to 260 70 mg l thus the influent consisted of raw wastewater 102 l d and propionic acid solution 8 8 l d the sludge recycle flow from the settler to the anaerobic reactor was set at 1 3 times of the influent 37 l d the hydraulic retention time hrt was 9 h considering only the reactors and 14 5 h considering also the settler the srt was controlled by manipulating the purge flow rate from the aerobic reactor although a period with anaerobic purge was also tested purging from a reactor instead of the recycle from the settler allows better control of srt since the biomass concentration in a reactor is more stable the reported srt values d table 2 were calculated with equation 1 1 s r t v a n a x a n a v a e r x a e r q p u r x a e r q e f f x e f f where vana and a vaer l are the volume of the anaerobic and aerobic reactors xana and xaer g l the biomass concentration in these reactors qpur and qeff the purge and effluent flow rate l d and xeff the biomass concentration in the effluent the ph of the aerobic reactor was monitored hach cri5335 but not controlled being in the range 7 1 7 5 the do was monitored with a hach cri6050 do probe the do and ph probes were connected to a multimeter controller hach cri44 do was controlled with an on off controller for the first 40 days due to the significant do fluctuations during the operation process the uneven distribution of do in the system could have led to a simultaneous nitrification and denitrification scenario chiu et al 2007 hence a proportional integral algorithm manipulating the aeration flow rate with a mass flow controller mfc f 201cv bronkhorst was implemented in the aerobic reactor on day 40 to maintain a controlled continuous aeration with a more stable do value the system was operated in a lab with roughly controlled room temperature 21 2ºc through air conditioning the whole system was controlled using an industrial pc advantech ppc 3190 with a data acquisition card advantech pci1711 running our addcontrol software developed in labwindows cvi national instruments 2 2 chemical and biochemical analyses samples for phosphate ammonium nitrate nitrite and cod were withdrawn from both reactors almost daily and filtered with 0 22 mm filters millipore phosphate concentration was analysed by a phosphate analyser 115 vac phosphax sc hach lange based on the vanadomolybdate yellow method ammonium concentration was measured with an ammonium analyser amtaxsc hach lange based on the potentiometric determination of ammonia ion chromatography dionexics 2000 was used for the determination of nitrite and nitrate cod was determined using kits hach lck 314 and lck 714 and a spectrophotomer sludge samples were withdrawn from the anaerobic reactor aerobic reactor and effluent and analysed for mixed liquor volatile suspended solids vss and total suspended solids tss according to standard methods apha 1995 the sludge volume index svi was calculated as the observed volume ml of sludge from the aerobic reactor after settling for 30 min divided by the tss g l measured on the same day 2 3 performance indicators the p removal efficiency pre was calculated as equation 2 2 p r e p i n f p a e r p i n f 100 where pinf and paer are the concentrations of p in the influent and the aerobic reactor cod removal after the anaerobic reactor creana and total cod removal cre were defined as equation 3 and 4 3 c r e a n a c o d f e e d c o d a n a c o d f e e d 100 4 c r e c o d i n f c o d a e r c o d i n f 100 where codfeed is the cod concentration entering the anaerobic reactor which also considers the external recycle contribution codana is the cod concentration in the anaerobic reactor codinf is the influent cod concentration combination of the raw wastewater and the extra propionic acid dosage and codaer is the cod in the aerobic reactor 2 4 fate of cod and nitrogen the fate of inlet cod and n was calculated by considering the outlet cod versus inlet cod and outlet n versus inlet n 5 c o d o u t c o d e f f c o d p u r c o d e f f b c o d p u r b where codeff and codpur are the filtered cod in the effluent and the purge and codeffb and codpurb are the cod due to biomass in the effluent and the purge these values were calculated assuming that the biomass corresponds to the measured vss and considering the general formula of bacteria c5h7no2 which leads to 1 416 gcod gvss similarly the fate of the inlet n can be calculated as equation 6 6 n o u t n h 4 n n o 3 n n o 2 n e f f n h 4 n n o 3 n n o 2 n p u r n e f f b n p u r b where nh4 n no3 n no2 n eff and nh4 n no3 n no2 n pur are the filtered amount of ammonium nitrate and nitrite in the effluent and the purge and neffb and npurb are the amount of nitrogen in the biomass calculated from the vss and the general formula for bacteria c5h7no2 2 5 batch tests four batch activity tests were carried out to investigate the ebpr process activity at different srts the sludge was withdrawn from the aerobic reactor after reaching steady state conditions at each srt 6 d day 96 5d day 118 4d day 147 and 3d day 158 the tests were performed in a magnetically stirred vessel 2 l monitored with ph sentix 81 wtw and do cellox 325 wtw probes anaerobic condition was maintained for the first 3 hours by supplying nitrogen gas and aerobic condition was achieved with a constant air flow with a mass flow meter mfc f 201cv bronkhorst for the next 3 hours the temperature was maintained constant 25 c by means of a water bath the ph was not controlled but was maintained at 7 6 0 3 throughout the process samples for phosphate ammonium nitrate nitrite and cod were taken every 30 min and immediately filtered with 0 22μm millipore filters 2 6 biochemical methane potential bmp bmp experiments were conducted to analyse the methane produced by anaerobic digestion of sludge angelidaki et al 2009 six sets of anaerobic digestion experiments were studied to investigate the bmp of sludge samples from the anaerobic and aerobic reactor at srt 6 4 and 3 d every test lasted 42 days sludge from the anaerobic digester of an urban wwtp manresa barcelona was used as inoculum and degassed for at least 3 days at 37 ºc before use the anaerobic and aerobic sludge as substrates were taken from the anaerobic and aerobic reactors when the system was at steady state at each srt condition control samples i e without substrate were used to obtain the net bmp both inoculum and substrate were kept at 2 gvss l of sludge the anaerobic digestion tests were conducted in 160 ml serum bottles with 125 ml of effective volume and 35 ml headspace for biogas production the ph of each bottle was initially set at 7 0 and n2 was sparged into all these bottles to obtain anaerobic conditions each sludge and control samples were tested in triplicate and kept in an oven at a constant temperature of 37ºc throughout the process the content of each bottle was mixed every day in each bmp test the increase of pressure in the headspace volume of each bottle was measured by a gas pressure meter to obtain the gas production and the volume of accumulated gas production was calculated expressed under standard conditions 25ºc 1 atm further details are provided by chan et al 2020 the biogas compositions i e ch4 co2 and h2 were periodically measured by a perkin elmer gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd 2 7 microbiological analyses fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analyses coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy leica microsystem heidelberg gmbh mannheim germany were performed as detailed in andani et al 2012 to evaluate the biomass community in the a o system the distribution of accumulibacter pao and their competitors competibacter gao defluviicoccus cluster i dfi and defluviicoccus cluster ii dfii were labelled paomix gaomix dfimix dfiimix and eubmix probes and quantified by using confocal microscopy and image analysis as described in jubany et al 2009 each sample was observed by applying around 40 randomly chosen clsm fields with 600 magnification of different x y and z coordinates all the probes detailed in table s1 were used with a formamide concentration of 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance under different srt the a stage ebpr system was operated under five different srt conditions by controlling the purge flow rate table 2 figure 1 compares the aimed srt to the measured srt when the system reached stable and successful simultaneous p and cod removal in period ii table 2 the srt was gradually decreased in view of determining the minimum srt possible with ebpr activity the lower was the srt the shorter to reach stable conditions the entire operation lasted for 166 days figure 2 shows the experimental c n and p profiles and table 3 the average performance during the whole experimental period figure 2a shows the experimental pinf pana paer and p removal efficiency pre pre increased to almost 60 during the first 20 days indicating the development of the pao community while c removal efficiency cre fig 2b was stable reaching values above 80 ammonia fig 2c scarcely decreased in both reactors nitrite was always below the detection limit and there was no nitrate presence until the day 30 fig 2d when nitrification built up nitrate is detrimental for the ebpr process due to the competition between pao and denitrifiers for the carbon source guerrero et al 2012a and thus nitrification should be avoided moreover in the a b concept nitrogen is supposed to be removed in the b stage with lower oxygen and cod requirements figure 3 shows the evolution of solids in the reactor during the experimental period it shows that nitrate build up and a non adequate do control led to a decrease in solids concentration hence the do control system was upgraded see details in section 2 1 on day 40 to maintain a more stable do and the purge was stopped for some days to recover the biomass concentration the reactor recovered and reached a steady state where nitrification was suppressed and pre and cre rose above 97 and 90 respectively the purge was increased to meet the desired srt 6 d and the solids in the system began to decrease concomitantly from day 61 to 80 period ii the system was operated at a srt 6 d by maintaining the flow rate of purge at 5 l d pana was most of the time above 25 mg po4 3 p l the highest value of pana was 34 7 mg l while paer was below 0 6mg l and pre was 94 6 table 3 in terms of cod most of the cod was consumed under anaerobic conditions i e codana 38 18 mg l was much lower than codinf 268 27 mg l and it was stored by pao achieving a high cre 94 5 although very satisfactory pre and cre were obtained nitrification appeared again and nitrate concentrations up to 5 mg l no3 n were observed the do setpoint was decreased from 1 to 0 5mg l in view of suppressing nitrification at period iii day 81 under certain srt and t conditions the do setpoint should be low enough to hinder nitrification but not to prevent pao growth moreover textbook knowledge states that besides hampering nitrification low do favours pao versus glycogen accumulating organisms gao carvalheira et al 2014 chiu et al 2007 further optimization of do setpoint to find the proper operational range may be possible although the difficulties to maintain a stable do in full scale wwtps under dynamic conditions should also be considered in our work pana in period iii was maintained at 26 0 0 2 mg l and pre was about 94 thus decreasing do from 1 to 0 5mg l was not detrimental for pao activity the cre decreased from 98 to 85 in the initial 2 days but it recovered to 94 after the following 3 days in conclusion the absence of nitrate in the effluent indicated that a lower do was beneficial for avoiding nitrification and a do setpoint of 0 5 mg l was adequate moreover lower do means less aeration and higher energy savings for instance valverde pérez et al 2016 could employ a high rate ebpr system but with a higher do in the range 2 3 mg l the extra addition of propionic acid was removed during days 110 to 113 to study the system performance at low codinf and without extra vfa as shown in figure 2a pana decreased dramatically from 25 6 to 5 4 mg l however due to the internal polymer reserves it still showed good pre about 96 during these 3 days creana showed a similar trend and it decreased sharply from 85 to 39 but the total cre was less affected decreasing from 95 to 84 therefore ebpr activity was still obtained with only raw wastewater but with much lower activity nitrate in the effluent showed a little increase during these 3 days given the poor p release activity the external propionic acid dosage was restarted and the system recovered immediately the concentration of tss in the reactor was in a range of 1 5 g l to 2 g l and svi was about 181 ml g external vfa addition is not feasible in a full scale scenario but low loaded wastewaters such as in this case are a drawback for implementing biological p removal since it requires organic matter as an electron donor then other actions for in situ vfa production could be applied such as fermentation of primary sludge or increasing the anaerobic reactor residence time for promoting fermentation of complex carbon sources guerrero et al 2012b 2015 longo et al 2015 luo et al 2019 subsequently srt was reduced to 5 days during the next 18 days period iv pana decreased from 32 0 to 20 8 mg l during the first 10 days and then increased gradually to 26 6 mg l but the pre remained stable between 94 and 99 similarly cre kept stable with 97 3 the concentration of tss in the reactor stabilized at 1 9 0 1 g l hence decreasing srt from 6 to 5 days had no significant effect on tss neither nitrate nor nitrite build up was observed from this point onwards therefore srt 5 d was a strict frontier value for the growth of nitrifiers in our system valverde pérez et al 2016 also pointed out that operating at srt 3 5 d their sbr system with ebpr also prevented nitrification in view of the good response of the system srt was further reduced to 4 days for the next 13 days period v successful pre and cre were achieved with 95 3 and 96 4 respectively the svi experienced an increase from 181 to 284 ml g however the system was able to maintain a stable state it is worth noticing that the objective of the a stage ebpr is to remove as much p as possible but considering that there is a subsequent biological b stage a minimum p concentration should be guaranteed for the growth of the microorganisms in the b stage the effluent p was kept low down to 0 3 0 2 mg l which is theoretically high enough to support the growth of the bacteria involved aob and anammox when removing a concentration around 50 mg n nh4 l finally the srt was decreased to 3 days in view of pushing the system to its limits period vi pana decreased from 34 5 to 27 6 mg l and peff kept increasing from 0 4 to 2 mg l accompanied with a sharp cre decay a high decrease in tss concentration down to only 0 9 g l was observed during the first 10 days of period vi resulting in a decrease of pre and cre to 85 0 14 0 and 92 6 respectively meanwhile svi increased considerably to 932 ml g showing very poor settleability which indicated the excessive growth of filamentous bacteria leading to filamentous bulking other works studying ebpr have already reported filamentous bulking sludge vaiopoulou et al 2007 valverde pérez et al 2016 yang et al 2013 which can lead to a poor system performance inducing the loss of biomass and the failure of system if the clarifier is not over dimensioned the factors for filamentous bacteria proliferation could be variable such as do f m and srt martins et al 2004 valverde pérez et al 2016 yang et al 2013 liao et al 2006 indicated that filamentous bacteria proliferation could be facilitated by low srt due to relatively unstable microbial communities the increased svi of our work was in agreement with the work of valverde pérez et al 2016 who reported an extreme increase of svi to 1100 ml g due to filamentous bulking at srt 3 5 d in an sbr given the fragile condition observed at srt 3 d the purge flow rate was decreased and srt 4 d was restored period vii however the system performance could not be recovered successfully because of the heavy loss of biomass according to our previous experience when the vss in the effluent exceeds 0 06 g l and svi is higher than 1000 ml g the proliferation of filamentous bacteria leads to biomass washout and system failure as the consequence of system failure tss in the effluent increased from 0 031 to 0 061 mg l and the tss in the reactor decreased to the minimum of 0 65 mg l on the other hand the ratio of vss tss was also affected by srt this ratio kept increasing gradually with the reduction of srt table 4 chan et al 2017 also observed that low srts resulted in higher vss tss in the reactor in our case operating at srt 3 d led to the failure of system with the maximum vss tss of 0 97 0 03 the value of vss tss tending to 1 was a red flag of the system that indicated that pao were being washed out in conclusion of the whole operational period our compromise scenario of srt 4 d was the minimum srt for pao growth low enough for the washout of nitrifiers and without high filamentous bulking under steady state however a warning should be given about the increased risk to observe bulking if a too low srt is used in this type of a stage ebpr system 3 2 batch tests under different srt figure 4 shows four batch tests with sludge obtained at srt 6 5 4 and 3 d similar trend lines were observed in the four experiments most of the cod was consumed after 180 min under anaerobic conditions and the remaining cod was consumed after 60 min of aerobic phase at the end of the aerobic phase p was depleted in terms of nitrogen very slight ammonia consumption was observed in both the anaerobic and aerobic phases but there were no significant changes in nitrite and nitrate concentration therefore no nitrification was observed during the batch tests which was in agreement with the performance of the a o system table 5 shows the pao activity indices from the four batch tests under different srt p release rate increased from 0 08 to 0 27 mgp gvss min with the reduction of srt from 6 d to 3 d however p uptake rate showed a different behaviour it increased from 0 12 to 0 26 mgp gvss min with the reduction of srt from 6 to 4 d and decreased dramatically to the lower value of 0 09 mgp gvssmin with srt 3 d these results are consistent with the higher pre and cre values obtained under srt 4 d when compared to 3 d furthermore the ability of pao to release p under short srt seems to be more robust than the p uptake ability 3 3 effect on bmp of srt and aerobic or anaerobic biomass the a stage ebpr integration enables the implementation of novel strategies in view of process optimisation for instance biomass could be purged from the anaerobic phase and since it has a higher pha content it could be used to increase energy recovery as biogas rather than being oxidised in the aerobic phase however the stability of the a stage ebpr system with this anaerobic purge should be demonstrated thus anaerobic purging was implemented for 15 days to prove its feasibility figure s4 the system was operated with aerobic purging during the first 50 days with successful pre 97 100 and cre around 98 the operation was stable with vss 2 8 0 1 g l fig s4c and svi 98 7 ml g on day 50 the purge was switched to the anaerobic reactor and the system was operated at srt 6 d by maintaining the purge flow rate at 5 l d pre remained stable at 97 2 cre was about 96 during the first days then experienced fluctuations from day 57 which could be due to the increase of cod concentration of raw wastewater however cre was always above 90 and codeff was less than 45 mg l the concentration of vss in the reactor showed a little decrease during the first days but it kept stable around 2 5 g l the svi experienced an increase to 260 ml g but ebpr performance was not affected hence steady biological p and cod removal without nitrification could be maintained despite the anaerobic purging the cod mass balance table s2 showed that cod mineralization with anaerobic purging was 42 2 which is in the same order than the 46 12 obtained with aerobic purge at the same srt 6 d once the stability of the system with anaerobic purge was demonstrated the possible bmp enhancement that could be achieved with the different sludge available in the a stage ebpr was evaluated figure 5 shows the bmp tests obtained with sludge purged from the anaerobic and aerobic reactors at different srt conditions while table 6 details a summary of the average results obtained the anaerobic sludge had the highest bmp 296 2 ml ch4 gvss at srt 4 d followed by srt 3 d 286 7 ml ch4 gvss and 6 d 231 7 ml ch4 gvss table 6 the same trend was obtained with aerobic sludge at each srt theoretically the lower the srt the more carbon can be stored as pha instead of being mineralized in high rate systems bolzonella et al 2005 and therefore more carbon is diverted to anaerobic digestion chan et al 2020 observed large bmp variations under different srt conditions from 401 to 306 ml ch4 gvss at srt 5 to 10 d bolzonella et al 2005 found that a reduction of srt from 20 to 10 days resulted in an increase of biogas production of about 25 in our work the highest bmp was obtained at srt 4 d since the amount of pao in sludge at srt 3 d was not enough to uptake the initial organic matter and hence the pha content was probably lower this observation is consistent with the better system performance and higher pao activity observed in the batch tests at srt 4 d our anaerobic sludge had 20 4 more bmp than aerobic sludge at different srts table 6 because of the higher pha content wang et al 2015 also found that higher pha content led to higher bmp their sludge with 14 3 of pha had 150 more bmp than that with a 2 1 pha content chan et al 2020 also demonstrated with an ebpr sbr system that bmp could be enhanced by 21 8 by using anaerobic sludge instead of aerobic sludge at srt 5 d the initial methane production rate impr varied significantly with different srt when srt was 6 d the imprs were the lowest 19 0 0 6 and 15 0 0 1 ml ch4 gvss d with anaerobic and aerobic sludge the highest values i e 22 0 0 8 and 20 0 1 3 ml ch4 gvss d were obtained at srt 4 d chan et al 2020 observed that the impr was relative to the pha content because pha could be more easily degraded than other compounds during anaerobic digestion and proposed a positive correlation between bmp and pha irrespective of srt and anaerobic or aerobic biomass wang et al 2016 also pointed out higher pha content had superior degradability in the initial 8 days hence it is explainable in our work that applying srt 4 d the observed impr was higher 3 4 the fate of cod n and p in the system the inlet cod had three different fates i as dissolved cod in the plant effluent and purge ii the formation of biomass exiting by either the effluent or the purge and iii the carbon mineralization in the system table 7 summarises all these fractions for the different periods the total fraction of i and ii was expressed as total outlet cod codout following the methodology detailed in section 2 4 codout increased with the decrease of srt except for period vii due to its unstable operation when operating the reactor at srt 6 d 54 12 of the inlet cod was quantified in the outlet and 46 12 was mineralized however when working at srt 4 d period v only 30 5 was mineralised while 58 5 could be recovered as biomass in the purge and an additional 6 1 as biomass in the effluent hence if a better biomass separation system could be implemented in the effluent a maximum of 64 6 of the cod in the influent could be recovered as biomass that could be redirected to biogas production these results fit well in the frame of developing innovative technologies for wrrfs aiming at energy autarky and resource recovery as the system was able to biologically remove organic matter and phosphorus and redirecting 64 6 of the cod to energy recovery rather than being oxidized to co2 this carbon redirection improvement was in the range of previous works in a stage system without ebpr implementation akanyeti et al 2010 jimenez et al 2015 but in our case the system was also able to remove biologically p when the srt was decreased to 3 d the codminer decreased to 20 10 and codout increased to 80 10 however these results were obtained when the plant was operating with bulking and unstable performance with lower ebpr activity regarding the implementation of p recovery strategies in this configuration the utilization of the anaerobic mixed liquor with a high concentration of p is the best alternative in the case of period v if assumed an average p concentration in the anaerobic reactor of 32 mgp l and a purge flow of 9 l d around 39 of the p in the influent would be contained in the purge stream this p could be recovered for example via precipitation as struvite jabr et al 2019 li et al 2019 rittmann et al 2011 or calcium phosphate law and pagilla 2018 recovering p from the anaerobic supernatant would also lead to a reduction of the p content in the sidestreams from anaerobic digestion which usually represent a significant fraction of the p treated in the secondary treatment kassouf et al 2019 the long term operation of sbrs with high ebpr activity and simultaneous p extraction from the anaerobic supernatant has been demonstrated in previous works reaching values up to 60 of recovery guisasola et al 2019 larriba et al 2020 the fate of influent n is either nitrification or biomass assimilation as shown in table 8 the total outlet n nout could account for all of the influent n at each srt operation conditions when the system was at steady state nout was slightly higher than 100 in all the periods probably because some organic nitrogen was not considered in the calculation of the n load in the influent importantly no significant nitrification was observed in the system looking into detail to the results of period v 27 1 of the nitrogen was used for biomass growth and 75 1 remained in the effluent mostly as ammonium 69 1 therefore a desired relative high concentration of ammonia in the a stage effluent was left for the following b stage which could be more energy saving compared with conventional nitrification denitrification processes these values improved the results reported by valverde pérez et al 2016b where about 40 of the ammonia was detected in the effluent when their ebpr system was operated at srt 3 d while the rest of n removed was attributed to assimilation overall the results presented in this section demonstrate the feasibility of integrating ebpr into a continuous anaerobic aerobic a stage system obtaining excellent cod and p removal with high redirection of cod to biomass 64 6 phosphorus to a concentrated stream of phosphate 39 and ammonium to the subsequent b stage 69 1 3 5 evolution of pao and gao presence in the microbial community the biomass distribution of our system was evaluated by fish labelling and quantification table 9 four groups of probes were used with sludge withdrawn from the aerobic reactor at days 147 srt 4 d period v and 157 srt 3 d period vi accumulibacter pao targeted by paomix led the predominant position 33 13 at srt 4d regarding the pao competitors competibacter labelled by gaomix accounted for 3 0 0 3 and defluviicoccus targeted by probes dfimix and dfiimix were 0 6 0 1 cluster i and 4 3 1 1 cluster ii the presence of defluviicoccus in our system was favoured by the use of propionic acid as additional carbon source which is reported to be a proper substrate for these microorganisms oehmen et al 2010 tayà et al 2013 these results show that a certain amount of competibacter and defluviicoccus could coexist with accumulibacter at srt 4 d without affecting the system performance a similar microbial community was reported by ong et al 2014 who reported good ebpr performance under the coexistence of accumulibacter and competibacter at different temperatures from 24 to 32ºc this coexistence has also been reported at full scale ebpr wwtps with stable performance lanham et al 2013 nielsen et al 2019 saunders et al 2003 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and at three full scale tropical wwtps qiu et al 2019 the microbial community experienced a remarkable shift when decreasing srt from 4 to 3 days a decrease of accumulibacter and competibacter was detected with the percentages about 22 2 and 1 6 0 3 respectively at srt 3 d which corresponded with the decrease in ebpr performance even faced with the washout of biomass at srt 3 d accumulibacter still showed the highest abundance interestingly both defluviicoccus cluster i and defluviicoccus cluster ii showed a great increase with the proportions of 4 2 0 5 and 7 9 1 6 respectively which could be correlated to the sludge bulking nittami et al 2009 pointed out that some defluviicoccus species are filamentous bacteria which are responsible for bulking problems in full scale ebpr plants treating domestic wastewater examples of fish images of the four microbial groups mentioned above are shown in fig s2 and s3 the morphologies of the biomass at srt 3 d a2 to d2 revealed more filamentous bacteria compared to the biomass at srt 4 d a1 to d1 which was in accordance with the system performance and more sludge bulking at srt 3 d li and stenstrom 2018 pointed out the biomass population succession or the production of extracellular polymers substances could be induced by changing srt and further affected solid settleability moreover defluviicoccus cluster ii d1 and d2 exhibited a filamentous overgrowth and owned more abundance compared with competibacter and defluviicoccus cluster i burow et al 2007 found that defluviicoccus cluster i and cluster ii could use propionic as substrate and defluviicoccus cluster ii showed relatively higher than competibacter and defluviicoccus cluster i in full scale ebpr systems which was consistent with our results though there was a limitation at srt 3 d in our case the above results could provide some useful information to researchers who are keen on energy efficiency resource recovery and sludge bulking control of wastewater treatment specifically the findings could establish some fundamental references for the application of ebpr in high rate a stage systems treating real wastewater 3 6 limitations and practical implications of the a stage ebpr the a stage of a b configurations aims to divert the maximum amount of cod to anaerobic digestion to increase energy recovery nitrogen is autotrophically removed in the b stage but phosphorus is usually removed by chemical precipitation this study proposes the use of a modified a stage including an anaerobic reactor to implement ebpr a stage ebpr the feasibility to operate with successful cod and biological p removal is demonstrated under pilot plant operation with optimal operation at srt 4 d and do setpoint of 0 5 mg l this stable operation was demonstrated at room temperature 21 2ºc and accurate do control if applied in a full scale environment srt should be seasonally adapted to the specific temperature as pao require a higher minimum srt at lower temperature to avoid washout chan et al 2020b this selected srt should be able to maintain pao activity while preventing nitrifiers growth achieving these conditions at lower temperature does not seem difficult since nitrifiers have a high degree of temperature dependency henze et al 2000 but pao temperature dependency has been reported to be medium henze et al 2000 or low chan et al 2020b operating at low do of 0 5 mg l also gives additional savings due to the lower aeration required but a good do control system should be implemented to avoid oxygen limitations in the aerobic reactor settling problems are usually found in a stage systems operated at low srt and iron salts addition is a typical solution proposed for these systems however the proposed a stage ebpr allows obtaining a good settleability except in the case of working at very low srt srt lower than 4 d should be avoided as it can lead to pao washout by inducing the proliferation of filamentous bacteria reducing biomass settleability and unintentionally decreasing vss and srt when wastage from the anaerobic reactor is implemented an additional settler would be needed to treat this low flowrate stream the effluents of this settler would be a concentrated biomass stream to be diverted to the anaerobic digester and a p concentrated stream to implement a p recovery strategies as for example using struvite precipitation larriba et al 2020 implementing a stage ebpr requires wastewater with enough organic matter to drive ebpr metcalf and eddy tchobanoglous et al 2013 recommend some threshold ratios for the design of wwtp configurations with cod n and p removal readily biodegradable cod rbcod content of 6 6 grbcod gno3 n and 10 g rbcod gp since n removal is not required in the a stage cod requirements decrease however if these requirements are not satisfied external carbon source addition or fermentation of primary sludge to produce extra vfa would be required a stage ebpr is an evolution of the a b systems that are currently under research lower energy recovery would be obtained a priori due to the higher srt 4d needed when compared to the conventional reported a stage systems 0 1 2d jimenez et al 2015 however mineralization for a conventional a stage is reported to be in a wide range depending on srt 14 0 1d 37 0 5d and 67 2d jimenez et al 2015 while a range from 30 5 4d to 46 12 6d was reported in this work for the a stage ebpr hence this theoretical decrease in energy recovery can be compensated by the higher pha content in the sludge with the additional advantages in the a stage ebpr of higher biomass stability avoidance of tertiary chemical p removal and the possibility to implement p recovery strategies using the anaerobic purge stream another possible implementation would be retrofitting an overloaded ludzack ettigner configuration for cod n removal into an a stage system for cod and p removal that should be complemented with an additional b stage for autotrophic n removal this would lead to a configuration with lower cod requirements for nutrient removal and higher energy recovery 4 conclusions this work shows the successful implementation of an innovative concept that integrates ebpr in a continuous anaerobic aerobic a stage system at low srt conditions a stage ebpr the best performance was obtained operating the system at srt 4 d and the aerobic reactor at a do setpoint of 0 5 mg l achieving p and cod removal efficiencies of 94 5 and 96 3 and avoiding nitrification bulking problems can appear at low srt biomass washout was observed when decreasing the srt to 3 d due to the poor settleability of solids higher biogas production is obtained using anaerobic sludge 20 24 higher bmp than aerobic sludge under the same conditions the highest bmp was 296 2 ml ch4 gvss using anaerobic sludge at srt 4 d a high fraction of cod in the influent can be diverted to biomass for energy recovery 64 6 at srt 4 d about 30 of inlet n is consumed for biomass growth leaving a significant fraction 69 1 as ammonium for the subsequent b stage the fish analysis at srt 4 d showed accumulibacter predominance 33 13 much higher than its competitors competibacter 3 0 0 3 defluviicoccus cluster i 0 6 0 1 and defluviicoccus cluster ii 4 3 1 1 both defluviicoccus clusters significantly increased

17270,recovering energy from wastewater in addition to its treatment is a hot trend in the new concept of water resource recovery facility wrrf high rate systems operating at low solid retention time srt have been proposed to meet this challenge in this paper the integration of enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in an anaerobic aerobic continuous high rate system a stage ebpr was evaluated successful p and cod removal were obtained operating at srt 6 5 and 4 days treating real wastewater while a further decrease to 3 days led to biomass washout the best steady state operational conditions were obtained at srt 4d with high removal percentage of p 94 5 and cod 96 3 and without detecting nitrification cod mineralization could be reduced to 30 while 64 of the entering carbon could be diverted as biomass to energy recovery regarding nitrogen about 69 1 of the influent n was left as ammonium in the effluent with 30 used for biomass growth the aerobic reactor could be operated at low dissolved oxygen do 0 5 mg l which is beneficial to decrease energy requirements biochemical methane potential bmp tests showed better productivity for the anaerobic sludge than the aerobic sludge with an optimal bmp of 296 2 ml ch4 gvss fish analysis at srt 4d revealed a high abundance of accumulibacter 33 13 and lower proportion of gao competibacter 3 0 0 3 defluviicoccus i 0 6 0 1 and defluviicoccus ii 4 3 1 1 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords a stage biochemical methane potential bmp enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr solids retention time srt 1 introduction wastewater treatment using conventional activated sludge systems has been beneficial for the whole society and environment for over 100 years this technology is robust and provides good effluent quality at the expense of high operating costs due to aeration and sludge management high organic matter losses due to mineralization and large areas for settlers to retain flocculent solids mccarty et al 2011 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however these conventional systems may not recover the potential energy present in the organic compounds of wastewater akanyeti et al 2010 the influent organic matter contains a significant amount of chemical energy stored in the chemical bonds around 1 9 kwh m3 bowen et al 2014 heidrich et al 2011 mccarty et al 2011 and the amount of energy required for aeration in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps is usually in the range 0 3 0 7 kwh m3 of wastewater jimenez et al 2015 shizas and bagley 2004 therefore there is a great potential for improving energy recovery in classical wastewater treatment systems current research focuses on proposing new wwtp configurations to recover resources i e nutrients and energy from industrial urban wastewater which represents a step forward from conventional treatment the idea is to transform wwtps into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs the integration of the bio refinery concept could be beneficial to solve the current issues of energy inefficient wastewater treatment processes and resource shortage under a circular economy scenario sheik et al 2014 one of the golden rules of this innovative concept is to promote the diversion of organic matter to anaerobic digestion to produce biogas the most common way is to send the primary and secondary sludge from wrrfs to the anaerobic digester to produce methane 5 7 kwh m3 some researchers have suggested that wrrfs could be transformed into self sustained energy systems by maximizing the organic matter fed to the anaerobic digester kartal et al 2010 verstraete and vlaeminck 2011 in this sense the most recent configurations have revisited an old concept the two stage a b configuration böhnke 1977 böhnke et al 1998 the a stage is in charge of organic matter removal while the b stage faces autotrophic nitrogen removal since the wastewater entering to the b stage should not contain organic matter the a stage employs a high rate activated sludge hras aiming at removing particulate and soluble organics through a combination of adsorption and degradation thus carbon is redirected and concentrated rather than mineralised and the solids produced are diverted to energy recovery through anaerobic digestion hras systems allow to recover an important fraction of the chemical oxygen demand cod in the influent typically in the range 50 80 sancho et al 2019 although new processes as the alternating activated adsorption are being developed to increase its performance wett et al 2020 hence maximization of energy recovery could be obtained by applying hras systems with a relative low srt between 0 5 and 4 days jimenez et al 2015 moreover this stage acts as a shock absorber of unexpected toxic loads that could be very detrimental to the b stage smitshuijzen et al 2016 besides organic matter and nitrogen the discharge of the phosphorus p contained in wastewater into the aquatic environment can lead to eutrophication which is detrimental to both aquatic life and water supply for domestic and industrial fields hanhoun et al 2011 however the fate of phosphorus in the a b configuration has not yet been fully studied and chemical precipitation in the tertiary step is currently the most typical option enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr has been widely used to remove p and organic matter from wastewater for some decades in ebpr systems polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao have abilities to store polyhydroxyalkanoate pha anaerobically from organic matter mainly volatile fatty acids vfa and to accumulate p as polyphosphate under anoxic or aerobic conditions if ebpr needs to be integrated into an a stage system an additional anaerobic reactor has to be included building an integrated a stage ebpr system is not only interesting for achieving simultaneous biological c and p removal and thus no further chemical precipitation of p would be required but also enables the application of other novel advanced configurations on the one hand an a stage ebpr system would be suitable for anaerobic wastage as biomass purged from the anaerobic reactor would have a high pha content and therefore a high potential for biogas production and energy recovery chan et al 2020a guisasola et al 2019 huda et al 2013 on the other hand a stage ebpr systems would be suitable for the implementation of mainstream p recovery strategies for instance by precipitating p from a stream from the anaerobic reactor acevedo et al 2015 guisasola et al 2019 larriba et al 2020 law and pagilla 2018 then pao are excellent candidates for decreasing the degree of organic matter mineralization for maximizing the amount of biogas produced during anaerobic digestion and for improving plant economics hence it would be extremely interesting to design and to operate ebpr systems i e anaerobic aerobic a o systems at very low srt however an a stage ebpr system requires the inclusion of an anaerobic phase in the a stage and operating at srts higher than those without ebpr a recent full scale study at different srts has shown a clear correlation between the ebpr performance and the srt achieving better and more consistent p removal at srt below 10 days with the optimum at srt 7d onnis hayden et al 2019 some studies have focused on integrating ebpr in short srt systems for removing carbon and p in view of energy efficiency and sustainability of the treatment process ge et al 2013 found more than 80 reduction in cod and p with a high rate sequencing batch reactor sbr process srt 2 3 d chan et al 2017 operated sbrs with ebpr for treating synthetic wastewater with successful results with a srt down to 3 6 d at 25ºc valverde pérez et al 2016 investigated the high rate ebpr system with a sbr and found that phosphate could be effectively removed with mitigated nitrification at the lowest srt 3 d on the other hand one of the most common causes of ebpr failure is the presence of nitrate under anaerobic conditions due to the occurrence of nitrification in the aerobic reactor recycling of nitrate to the anaerobic reactor can result in denitrifiers using part of the carbon source and thus outcompeting pao nitrification could be suppressed at low srt and low do however these two strategies can also affect pao growth and thus a compromise scenario must be found choosing a srt high enough for the pao growth and low enough for more efficient carbon removal and for the washout of nitrifiers moreover the fraction of vfa in the influent wastewater is also a key factor since a low vfa content would require a high anaerobic residence time to convert the organic matter into vfa considering this background this work faces the integration of ebpr in a continuous a stage system treating real wastewater the main objectives of this work are i to explore the feasibility of the continuous a stage ebpr system ii to investigate the minimum srt to maintain successful organic matter and p removal in the long term iii to prevent nitrification under low srt conditions without the addition of any nitrification inhibitor and iv to gain insight into the possibility of purging from the anaerobic reactor of this novel configuration in view of harvesting biomass with high pha content to maximize biogas production 2 materials and methods 2 1 equipment the pilot plant used figure s1 consisted of two continuous stirred tank reactors cstr one anaerobic v 19l and one aerobic v 23l and a settler 25l the wastewater used was the primary settler effluent of the wwtp of manresa barcelona spain the average characteristics of the raw wastewater are shown in table 1 because of the low cod concentration additional propionic acid was added from a concentrated solution 2300 mgcod l to increase the cod concentration of the influent up to 260 70 mg l thus the influent consisted of raw wastewater 102 l d and propionic acid solution 8 8 l d the sludge recycle flow from the settler to the anaerobic reactor was set at 1 3 times of the influent 37 l d the hydraulic retention time hrt was 9 h considering only the reactors and 14 5 h considering also the settler the srt was controlled by manipulating the purge flow rate from the aerobic reactor although a period with anaerobic purge was also tested purging from a reactor instead of the recycle from the settler allows better control of srt since the biomass concentration in a reactor is more stable the reported srt values d table 2 were calculated with equation 1 1 s r t v a n a x a n a v a e r x a e r q p u r x a e r q e f f x e f f where vana and a vaer l are the volume of the anaerobic and aerobic reactors xana and xaer g l the biomass concentration in these reactors qpur and qeff the purge and effluent flow rate l d and xeff the biomass concentration in the effluent the ph of the aerobic reactor was monitored hach cri5335 but not controlled being in the range 7 1 7 5 the do was monitored with a hach cri6050 do probe the do and ph probes were connected to a multimeter controller hach cri44 do was controlled with an on off controller for the first 40 days due to the significant do fluctuations during the operation process the uneven distribution of do in the system could have led to a simultaneous nitrification and denitrification scenario chiu et al 2007 hence a proportional integral algorithm manipulating the aeration flow rate with a mass flow controller mfc f 201cv bronkhorst was implemented in the aerobic reactor on day 40 to maintain a controlled continuous aeration with a more stable do value the system was operated in a lab with roughly controlled room temperature 21 2ºc through air conditioning the whole system was controlled using an industrial pc advantech ppc 3190 with a data acquisition card advantech pci1711 running our addcontrol software developed in labwindows cvi national instruments 2 2 chemical and biochemical analyses samples for phosphate ammonium nitrate nitrite and cod were withdrawn from both reactors almost daily and filtered with 0 22 mm filters millipore phosphate concentration was analysed by a phosphate analyser 115 vac phosphax sc hach lange based on the vanadomolybdate yellow method ammonium concentration was measured with an ammonium analyser amtaxsc hach lange based on the potentiometric determination of ammonia ion chromatography dionexics 2000 was used for the determination of nitrite and nitrate cod was determined using kits hach lck 314 and lck 714 and a spectrophotomer sludge samples were withdrawn from the anaerobic reactor aerobic reactor and effluent and analysed for mixed liquor volatile suspended solids vss and total suspended solids tss according to standard methods apha 1995 the sludge volume index svi was calculated as the observed volume ml of sludge from the aerobic reactor after settling for 30 min divided by the tss g l measured on the same day 2 3 performance indicators the p removal efficiency pre was calculated as equation 2 2 p r e p i n f p a e r p i n f 100 where pinf and paer are the concentrations of p in the influent and the aerobic reactor cod removal after the anaerobic reactor creana and total cod removal cre were defined as equation 3 and 4 3 c r e a n a c o d f e e d c o d a n a c o d f e e d 100 4 c r e c o d i n f c o d a

reactor codinf is the influent cod concentration combination of the raw wastewater and the extra propionic acid dosage and codaer is the cod in the aerobic reactor 2 4 fate of cod and nitrogen the fate of inlet cod and n was calculated by considering the outlet cod versus inlet cod and outlet n versus inlet n 5 c o d o u t c o d e f f c o d p u r c o d e f f b c o d p u r b where codeff and codpur are the filtered cod in the effluent and the purge and codeffb and codpurb are the cod due to biomass in the effluent and the purge these values were calculated assuming that the biomass corresponds to the measured vss and considering the general formula of bacteria c5h7no2 which leads to 1 416 gcod gvss similarly the fate of the inlet n can be calculated as equation 6 6 n o u t n h 4 n n o 3 n n o 2 n e f f n h 4 n n o 3 n n o 2 n p u r n e f f b n p u r b where nh4 n no3 n no2 n eff and nh4 n no3 n no2 n pur are the filtered amount of ammonium nitrate and nitrite in the effluent and the purge and neffb and npurb are the amount of nitrogen in the biomass calculated from the vss and the general formula for bacteria c5h7no2 2 5 batch tests four batch activity tests were carried out to investigate the ebpr process activity at different srts the sludge was withdrawn from the aerobic reactor after reaching steady state conditions at each srt 6 d day 96 5d day 118 4d day 147 and 3d day 158 the tests were performed in a magnetically stirred vessel 2 l monitored with ph sentix 81 wtw and do cellox 325 wtw probes anaerobic condition was maintained for the first 3 hours by supplying nitrogen gas and aerobic condition was achieved with a constant air flow with a mass flow meter mfc f 201cv bronkhorst for the next 3 hours the temperature was maintained constant 25 c by means of a water bath the ph was not controlled but was maintained at 7 6 0 3 throughout the process samples for phosphate ammonium nitrate nitrite and cod were taken every 30 min and immediately filtered with 0 22μm millipore filters 2 6 biochemical methane potential bmp bmp experiments were conducted to analyse the methane produced by anaerobic digestion of sludge angelidaki et al 2009 six sets of anaerobic digestion experiments were studied to investigate the bmp of sludge samples from the anaerobic and aerobic reactor at srt 6 4 and 3 d every test lasted 42 days sludge from the anaerobic digester of an urban wwtp manresa barcelona was used as inoculum and degassed for at least 3 days at 37 ºc before use the anaerobic and aerobic sludge as substrates were taken from the anaerobic and aerobic reactors when the system was at steady state at each srt condition control samples i e without substrate were used to obtain the net bmp both inoculum and substrate were kept at 2 gvss l of sludge the anaerobic digestion tests were conducted in 160 ml serum bottles with 125 ml of effective volume and 35 ml headspace for biogas production the ph of each bottle was initially set at 7 0 and n2 was sparged into all these bottles to obtain anaerobic conditions each sludge and control samples were tested in triplicate and kept in an oven at a constant temperature of 37ºc throughout the process the content of each bottle was mixed every day in each bmp test the increase of pressure in the headspace volume of each bottle was measured by a gas pressure meter to obtain the gas production and the volume of accumulated gas production was calculated expressed under standard conditions 25ºc 1 atm further details are provided by chan et al 2020 the biogas compositions i e ch4 co2 and h2 were periodically measured by a perkin elmer gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd 2 7 microbiological analyses fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analyses coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy leica microsystem heidelberg gmbh mannheim germany were performed as detailed in andani et al 2012 to evaluate the biomass community in the a o system the distribution of accumulibacter pao and their competitors competibacter gao defluviicoccus cluster i dfi and defluviicoccus cluster ii dfii were labelled paomix gaomix dfimix dfiimix and eubmix probes and quantified by using confocal microscopy and image analysis as described in jubany et al 2009 each sample was observed by applying around 40 randomly chosen clsm fields with 600 magnification of different x y and z coordinates all the probes detailed in table s1 were used with a formamide concentration of 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance under different srt the a stage ebpr system was operated under five different srt conditions by controlling the purge flow rate table 2 figure 1 compares the aimed srt to the measured srt when the system reached stable and successful simultaneous p and cod removal in period ii table 2 the srt was gradually decreased in view of determining the minimum srt possible with ebpr activity the lower was the srt the shorter to reach stable conditions the entire operation lasted for 166 days figure 2 shows the experimental c n and p profiles and table 3 the average performance during the whole experimental period figure 2a shows the experimental pinf pana paer and p removal efficiency pre pre increased to almost 60 during the first 20 days indicating the development of the pao community while c removal efficiency cre fig 2b was stable reaching values above 80 ammonia fig 2c scarcely decreased in both reactors nitrite was always below the detection limit and there was no nitrate presence until the day 30 fig 2d when nitrification built up nitrate is detrimental for the ebpr process due to the competition between pao and denitrifiers for the carbon source guerrero et al 2012a and thus nitrification should be avoided moreover in the a b concept nitrogen is supposed to be removed in the b stage with lower oxygen and cod requirements figure 3 shows the evolution of solids in the reactor during the experimental period it shows that nitrate build up and a non adequate do control led to a decrease in solids concentration hence the do control system was upgraded see details in section 2 1 on day 40 to maintain a more stable do and the purge was stopped for some days to recover the biomass concentration the reactor recovered and reached a steady state where nitrification was suppressed and pre and cre rose above 97 and 90 respectively the purge was increased to meet the desired srt 6 d and the solids in the system began to decrease concomitantly from day 61 to 80 period ii the system was operated at a srt 6 d by maintaining the flow rate of purge at 5 l d pana was most of the time above 25 mg po4 3 p l the highest value of pana was 34 7 mg l while paer was below 0 6mg l and pre was 94 6 table 3 in terms of cod most of the cod was consumed under anaerobic conditions i e codana 38 18 mg l was much lower than codinf 268 27 mg l and it was stored by pao achieving a high cre 94 5 although very satisfactory pre and cre were obtained nitrification appeared again and nitrate concentrations up to 5 mg l no3 n were observed the do setpoint was decreased from 1 to 0 5mg l in view of suppressing nitrification at period iii day 81 under certain srt and t conditions the do setpoint should be low enough to hinder nitrification but not to prevent pao growth moreover textbook knowledge states that besides hampering nitrification low do favours pao versus glycogen accumulating organisms gao carvalheira et al 2014 chiu et al 2007 further optimization of do setpoint to find the proper operational range may be possible although the difficulties to maintain a stable do in full scale wwtps under dynamic conditions should also be considered in our work pana in period iii was maintained at 26 0 0 2 mg l and pre was about 94 thus decreasing do from 1 to 0 5mg l was not detrimental for pao activity the cre decreased from 98 to 85 in the initial 2 days but it recovered to 94 after the following 3 days in conclusion the absence of nitrate in the effluent indicated that a lower do was beneficial for avoiding nitrification and a do setpoint of 0 5 mg l was adequate moreover lower do means less aeration and higher energy savings for instance valverde pérez et al 2016 could employ a high rate ebpr system but with a higher do in the range 2 3 mg l the extra addition of propionic acid was removed during days 110 to 113 to study the system performance at low codinf and without extra vfa as shown in figure 2a pana decreased dramatically from 25 6 to 5 4 mg l however due to the internal polymer reserves it still showed good pre about 96 during these 3 days creana showed a similar trend and it decreased sharply from 85 to 39 but the total cre was less affected decreasing from 95 to 84 therefore ebpr activity was still obtained with only raw wastewater but with much lower activity nitrate in the effluent showed a little increase during these 3 days given the poor p release activity the external propionic acid dosage was restarted and the system recovered immediately the concentration of tss in the reactor was in a range of 1 5 g l to 2 g l and svi was about 181 ml g external vfa addition is not feasible in a full scale scenario but low loaded wastewaters such as in this case are a drawback for implementing biological p removal since it requires organic matter as an electron donor then other actions for in situ vfa production could be applied such as fermentation of primary sludge or increasing the anaerobic reactor residence time for promoting fermentation of complex carbon sources guerrero et al 2012b 2015 longo et al 2015 luo et al 2019 subsequently srt was reduced to 5 days during the next 18 days period iv pana decreased from 32 0 to 20 8 mg l during the first 10 days and then increased gradually to 26 6 mg l but the pre remained stable between 94 and 99 similarly cre kept stable with 97 3 the concentration of tss in the reactor stabilized at 1 9 0 1 g l hence decreasing srt from 6 to 5 days had no significant effect on tss neither nitrate nor nitrite build up was observed from this point onwards therefore srt 5 d was a strict frontier value for the growth of nitrifiers in our system valverde pérez et al 2016 also pointed out that operating at srt 3 5 d their sbr system with ebpr also prevented nitrification in view of the good response of the system srt was further reduced to 4 days for the next 13 days period v successful pre and cre were achieved with 95 3 and 96 4 respectively the svi experienced an increase from 181 to 284 ml g however the system was able to maintain a stable state it is worth noticing that the objective of the a stage ebpr is to remove as much p as possible but considering that there is a subsequent biological b stage a minimum p concentration should be guaranteed for the growth of the microorganisms in the b stage the effluent p was kept low down to 0 3 0 2 mg l which is theoretically high enough to support the growth of the bacteria involved aob and anammox when removing a concentration around 50 mg n nh4 l finally the srt was decreased to 3 days in view of pushing the system to its limits period vi pana decreased from 34 5 to 27 6 mg l and peff kept increasing from 0 4 to 2 mg l accompanied with a sharp cre decay a high decrease in tss concentration down to only 0 9 g l was observed during the first 10 days of period vi resulting in a decrease of pre and cre to 85 0 14 0 and 92 6 respectively meanwhile svi increased considerably to 932 ml g showing very poor settleability which indicated the excessive growth of filamentous bacteria leading to filamentous bulking other works studying ebpr have already reported filamentous bulking sludge vaiopoulou et al 2007 valverde pérez et al 2016 yang et al 2013 which can lead to a poor system performance inducing the loss of biomass and the failure of system if the clarifier is not over dimensioned the factors for filamentous bacteria proliferation could be variable such as do f m and srt martins et al 2004 valverde pérez et al 2016 yang et al 2013 liao et al 2006 indicated that filamentous bacteria proliferation could be facilitated by low srt due to relatively unstable microbial communities the increased svi of our work was in agreement with the work of valverde pérez et al 2016 who reported an extreme increase of svi to 1100 ml g due to filamentous bulking at srt 3 5 d in an sbr given the fragile condition observed at srt 3 d the purge flow rate was decreased and srt 4 d was restored period vii however the system performance could not be recovered successfully because of the heavy loss of biomass according to our previous experience when the vss in the effluent exceeds 0 06 g l and svi is higher than 1000 ml g the proliferation of filamentous bacteria leads to biomass washout and system failure as the consequence of system failure tss in the effluent increased from 0 031 to 0 061 mg l and the tss in the reactor decreased to the minimum of 0 65 mg l on the other hand the ratio of vss tss was also affected by srt this ratio kept increasing gradually with the reduction of srt table 4 chan et al 2017 also observed that low srts resulted in higher vss tss in the reactor in our case operating at srt 3 d led to the failure of system with the maximum vss tss of 0 97 0 03 the value of vss tss tending to 1 was a red flag of the system that indicated that pao were being washed out in conclusion of the whole operational period our compromise scenario of srt 4 d was the minimum srt for pao growth low enough for the washout of nitrifiers and without high filamentous bulking under steady state however a warning should be given about the increased risk to observe bulking if a too low srt is used in this type of a stage ebpr system 3 2 batch tests under different srt figure 4 shows four batch tests with sludge obtained at srt 6 5 4 and 3 d similar trend lines were observed in the four experiments most of the cod was consumed after 180 min under anaerobic conditions and the remaining cod was consumed after 60 min of aerobic phase at the end of the aerobic phase p was depleted in terms of nitrogen very slight ammonia consumption was observed in both the anaerobic and aerobic phases but there were no significant changes in nitrite and nitrate concentration therefore no nitrification was observed during the batch tests which was in agreement with the performance of the a o system table 5 shows the pao activity indices from the four batch tests under different srt p release rate increased from 0 08 to 0 27 mgp gvss min with the reduction of srt from 6 d to 3 d however p uptake rate showed a different behaviour it increased from 0 12 to 0 26 mgp gvss min with the reduction of srt from 6 to 4 d and decreased dramatically to the lower value of 0 09 mgp gvssmin with srt 3 d these results are consistent with the higher pre and cre values obtained under srt 4 d when compared to 3 d furthermore the ability of pao to release p under short srt seems to be more robust than the p uptake ability 3 3 effect on bmp of srt and aerobic or anaerobic biomass the a stage ebpr integration enables the implementation of novel strategies in view of process optimisation for instance biomass could be purged from the anaerobic phase and since it has a higher pha content it could be used to increase energy recovery as biogas rather than being oxidised in the aerobic phase however the stability of the a stage ebpr system with this anaerobic purge should be demonstrated thus anaerobic purging was implemented for 15 days to prove its feasibility figure s4 the system was operated with aerobic purging during the first 50 days with successful pre 97 100 and cre around 98 the operation was stable with vss 2 8 0 1 g l fig s4c and svi 98 7 ml g on day 50 the purge was switched to the anaerobic reactor and the system was operated at srt 6 d by maintaining the purge flow rate at 5 l d pre remained stable at 97 2 cre was about 96 during the first days then experienced fluctuations from day 57 which could be due to the increase of cod concentration of raw wastewater however cre was always above 90 and codeff was less than 45 mg l the concentration of vss in the reactor showed a little decrease during the first days but it kept stable around 2 5 g l the svi experienced an increase to 260 ml g but ebpr performance was not affected hence steady biological p and cod removal without nitrification could be maintained despite the anaerobic purging the cod mass balance table s2 showed that cod mineralization with anaerobic purging was 42 2 which is in the same order than the 46 12 obtained with aerobic purge at the same srt 6 d once the stability of the system with anaerobic purge was demonstrated the possible bmp enhancement that could be achieved with the different sludge available in the a stage ebpr was evaluated figure 5 shows the bmp tests obtained with sludge purged from the anaerobic and aerobic reactors at different srt conditions while table 6 details a summary of the average results obtained the anaerobic sludge had the highest bmp 296 2 ml ch4 gvss at srt 4 d followed by srt 3 d 286 7 ml ch4 gvss and 6 d 231 7 ml ch4 gvss table 6 the same trend was obtained with aerobic sludge at each srt theoretically the lower the srt the more carbon can be stored as pha instead of being mineralized in high rate systems bolzonella et al 2005 and therefore more carbon is diverted to anaerobic digestion chan et al 2020 observed large bmp variations under different srt conditions from 401 to 306 ml ch4 gvss at srt 5 to 10 d bolzonella et al 2005 found that a reduction of srt from 20 to 10 days resulted in an increase of biogas production of about 25 in our work the highest bmp was obtained at srt 4 d since the amount of pao in sludge at srt 3 d was not enough to uptake the initial organic matter and hence the pha content was probably lower this observation is consistent with the better system performance and higher pao activity observed in the batch tests at srt 4 d our anaerobic sludge had 20 4 more bmp than aerobic sludge at different srts table 6 because of the higher pha content wang et al 2015 also found that higher pha content led to higher bmp their sludge with 14 3 of pha had 150 more bmp than that with a 2 1 pha content chan et al 2020 also demonstrated with an ebpr sbr system that bmp could be enhanced by 21 8 by using anaerobic sludge instead of aerobic sludge at srt 5 d the initial methane production rate impr varied significantly with different srt when srt was 6 d the imprs were the lowest 19 0 0 6 and 15 0 0 1 ml ch4 gvss d with anaerobic and aerobic sludge the highest values i e 22 0 0 8 and 20 0 1 3 ml ch4 gvss d were obtained at srt 4 d chan et al 2020 observed that the impr was relative to the pha content because pha could be more easily degraded than other compounds during anaerobic digestion and proposed a positive correlation between bmp and pha irrespective of srt and anaerobic or aerobic biomass wang et al 2016 also pointed out higher pha content had superior degradability in the initial 8 days hence it is explainable in our work that applying srt 4 d the observed impr was higher 3 4 the fate of cod n and p in the system the inlet cod had three different fates i as dissolved cod in the plant effluent and purge ii the formation of biomass exiting by either the effluent or the purge and iii the carbon mineralization in the system table 7 summarises all these fractions for the different periods the total fraction of i and ii was expressed as total outlet cod codout following the methodology detailed in section 2 4 codout increased with the decrease of srt except for period vii due to its unstable operation when operating the reactor at srt 6 d 54 12 of the inlet cod was quantified in the outlet and 46 12 was mineralized however when working at srt 4 d period v only 30 5 was mineralised while 58 5 could be recovered as biomass in the purge and an additional 6 1 as biomass in the effluent hence if a better biomass separation system could be implemented in the effluent a maximum of 64 6 of the cod in the influent could be recovered as biomass that could be redirected to biogas production these results fit well in the frame of developing innovative technologies for wrrfs aiming at energy autarky and resource recovery as the system was able to biologically remove organic matter and phosphorus and redirecting 64 6 of the cod to energy recovery rather than being oxidized to co2 this carbon redirection improvement was in the range of previous works in a stage system without ebpr implementation akanyeti et al 2010 jimenez et al 2015 but in our case the system was also able to remove biologically p when the srt was decreased to 3 d the codminer decreased to 20 10 and codout increased to 80 10 however these results were obtained when the plant was operating with bulking and unstable performance with lower ebpr activity regarding the implementation of p recovery strategies in this configuration the utilization of the anaerobic mixed liquor with a high concentration of p is the best alternative in the case of period v if assumed an average p concentration in the anaerobic reactor of 32 mgp l and a purge flow of 9 l d around 39 of the p in the influent would be contained in the purge stream this p could be recovered for example via precipitation as struvite jabr et al 2019 li et al 2019 rittmann et al 2011 or calcium phosphate law and pagilla 2018 recovering p from the anaerobic supernatant would also lead to a reduction of the p content in the sidestreams from anaerobic digestion which usually represent a significant fraction of the p treated in the secondary treatment kassouf et al 2019 the long term operation of sbrs with high ebpr activity and simultaneous p extraction from the anaerobic supernatant has been demonstrated in previous works reaching values up to 60 of recovery guisasola et al 2019 larriba et al 2020 the fate of influent n is either nitrification or biomass assimilation as shown in table 8 the total outlet n nout could account for all of the influent n at each srt operation conditions when the system was at steady state nout was slightly higher than 100 in all the periods probably because some organic nitrogen was not considered in the calculation of the n load in the influent importantly no significant nitrification was observed in the system looking into detail to the results of period v 27 1 of the nitrogen was used for biomass growth and 75 1 remained in the effluent mostly as ammonium 69 1 therefore a desired relative high concentration of ammonia in the a stage effluent was left for the following b stage which could be more energy saving compared with conventional nitrification denitrification processes these values improved the results reported by valverde pérez et al 2016b where about 40 of the ammonia was detected in the effluent when their ebpr system was operated at srt 3 d while the rest of n removed was attributed to assimilation overall the results presented in this section demonstrate the feasibility of integrating ebpr into a continuous anaerobic aerobic a stage system obtaining excellent cod and p removal with high redirection of cod to biomass 64 6 phosphorus to a concentrated stream of phosphate 39 and ammonium to the subsequent b stage 69 1 3 5 evolution of pao and gao presence in the microbial community the biomass distribution of our system was evaluated by fish labelling and quantification table 9 four groups of probes were used with sludge withdrawn from the aerobic reactor at days 147 srt 4 d period v and 157 srt 3 d period vi accumulibacter pao targeted by paomix led the predominant position 33 13 at srt 4d regarding the pao competitors competibacter labelled by gaomix accounted for 3 0 0 3 and defluviicoccus targeted by probes dfimix and dfiimix were 0 6 0 1 cluster i and 4 3 1 1 cluster ii the presence of defluviicoccus in our system was favoured by the use of propionic acid as additional carbon source which is reported to be a proper substrate for these microorganisms oehmen et al 2010 tayà et al 2013 these results show that a certain amount of competibacter and defluviicoccus could coexist with accumulibacter at srt 4 d without affecting the system performance a similar microbial community was reported by ong et al 2014 who reported good ebpr performance under the coexistence of accumulibacter and competibacter at different temperatures from 24 to 32ºc this coexistence has also been reported at full scale ebpr wwtps with stable performance lanham et al 2013 nielsen et al 2019 saunders et al 2003 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and at three full scale tropical wwtps qiu et al 2019 the microbial community experienced a remarkable shift when decreasing srt from 4 to 3 days a decrease of accumulibacter and competibacter was detected with the percentages about 22 2 and 1 6 0 3 respectively at srt 3 d which corresponded with the decrease in ebpr performance even faced with the washout of biomass at srt 3 d accumulibacter still showed the highest abundance interestingly both defluviicoccus cluster i and defluviicoccus cluster ii showed a great increase with the proportions of 4 2 0 5 and 7 9 1 6 respectively which could be correlated to the sludge bulking nittami et al 2009 pointed out that some defluviicoccus species are filamentous bacteria which are responsible for bulking problems in full scale ebpr plants treating domestic wastewater examples of fish images of the four microbial groups mentioned above are shown in fig s2 and s3 the morphologies of the biomass at srt 3 d a2 to d2 revealed more filamentous bacteria compared to the biomass at srt 4 d a1 to d1 which was in accordance with the system performance and more sludge bulking at srt 3 d li and stenstrom 2018 pointed out the biomass population succession or the production of extracellular polymers substances could be induced by changing srt and further affected solid settleability moreover defluviicoccus cluster ii d1 and d2 exhibited a filamentous overgrowth and owned more abundance compared with competibacter and defluviicoccus cluster i burow et al 2007 found that defluviicoccus cluster i and cluster ii could use propionic as substrate and defluviicoccus cluster ii showed relatively higher than competibacter and defluviicoccus cluster i in full scale ebpr systems which was consistent with our results though there was a limitation at srt 3 d in our case the above results could provide some useful information to researchers who are keen on energy efficiency resource recovery and sludge bulking control of wastewater treatment specifically the findings could establish some fundamental references for the application of ebpr in high rate a stage systems treating real wastewater 3 6 limitations and practical implications of the a stage ebpr the a stage of a b configurations aims to divert the maximum amount of cod to anaerobic digestion to increase energy recovery nitrogen is autotrophically removed in the b stage but phosphorus is usually removed by chemical precipitation this study proposes the use of a modified a stage including an anaerobic reactor to implement ebpr a stage ebpr the feasibility to operate with successful cod and biological p removal is demonstrated under pilot plant operation with optimal operation at srt 4 d and do setpoint of 0 5 mg l this stable operation was demonstrated at room temperature 21 2ºc and accurate do control if applied in a full scale environment srt should be seasonally adapted to the specific temperature as pao require a higher minimum srt at lower temperature to avoid washout chan et al 2020b this selected srt should be able to maintain pao activity while preventing nitrifiers growth achieving these conditions at lower temperature does not seem difficult since nitrifiers have a high degree of temperature dependency henze et al 2000 but pao temperature dependency has been reported to be medium henze et al 2000 or low chan et al 2020b operating at low do of 0 5 mg l also gives additional savings due to the lower aeration required but a good do control system should be implemented to avoid oxygen limitations in the aerobic reactor settling problems are usually found in a stage systems operated at low srt and iron salts addition is a typical solution proposed for these systems however the proposed a stage ebpr allows obtaining a good settleability except in the case of working at very low srt srt lower than 4 d should be avoided as it can lead to pao washout by inducing the proliferation of filamentous bacteria reducing biomass settleability and unintentionally decreasing vss and srt when wastage from the anaerobic reactor is implemented an additional settler would be needed to treat this low flowrate stream the effluents of this settler would be a concentrated biomass stream to be diverted to the anaerobic digester and a p concentrated stream to implement a p recovery strategies as for example using struvite precipitation larriba et al 2020 implementing a stage ebpr requires wastewater with enough organic matter to drive ebpr metcalf and eddy tchobanoglous et al 2013 recommend some threshold ratios for the design of wwtp configurations with cod n and p removal readily biodegradable cod rbcod content of 6 6 grbcod gno3 n and 10 g rbcod gp since n removal is not required in the a stage cod requirements decrease however if these requirements are not satisfied external carbon source addition or fermentation of primary sludge to produce extra vfa would be required a stage ebpr is an evolution of the a b systems that are currently under research lower energy recovery would be obtained a priori due to the higher srt 4d needed when compared to the conventional reported a stage systems 0 1 2d jimenez et al 2015 however mineralization for a conventional a stage is reported to be in a wide range depending on srt 14 0 1d 37 0 5d and 67 2d jimenez et al 2015 while a range from 30 5 4d to 46 12 6d was reported in this work for the a stage ebpr hence this theoretical decrease in energy recovery can be compensated by the higher pha content in the sludge with the additional advantages in the a stage ebpr of higher biomass stability avoidance of tertiary chemical p removal and the possibility to implement p recovery strategies using the anaerobic purge stream another possible implementation would be retrofitting an overloaded ludzack ettigner configuration for cod n removal into an a stage system for cod and p removal that should be complemented with an additional b stage for autotrophic n removal this would lead to a configuration with lower cod requirements for nutrient removal and higher energy recovery 4 conclusions this work shows the successful implementation of an innovative concept that integrates ebpr in a continuous anaerobic aerobic a stage system at low srt conditions a stage ebpr the best performance was obtained operating the system at srt 4 d and the aerobic reactor at a do setpoint of 0 5 mg l achieving p and cod removal efficiencies of 94 5 and 96 3 and avoiding nitrification bulking problems can appear at low srt biomass washout was observed when decreasing the srt to 3 d due to the poor settleability of solids higher biogas production is obtained using anaerobic sludge 20 24 higher bmp than aerobic sludge under the same conditions the highest bmp was 296 2 ml ch4 gvss using anaerobic sludge at srt 4 d a high fraction of cod in the influent can be diverted to biomass for energy recovery 64 6 at srt 4 d about 30 of inlet n is consumed for biomass growth leaving a significant fraction 69 1 as ammonium for the subsequent b stage the fish analysis at srt 4 d showed accumulibacter predominance 33 13 much higher than its competitors competibacter 3 0 0 3 defluviicoccus cluster i 0 6 0 1 and defluviicoccus cluster ii 4 3 1 1 both defluviicoccus clusters significantly increased when srt was decreased to 3 d 4 2 0 5 for cluster i and 7 9 1 6 for cluster ii declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17271,the advantage of light to heat conversion can be employed as an optical alternative for environmental remediation as a proof of concept for the first time we introduce the light to heat conversion application in peroxydisulfate pds activation by molybdenum disulphide mos2 under near infrared nir light irradiation theoretical kinetics analysis suggests that the reaction rates of pds activation is increased up to 9 2 times when increasing from room temperature to 50 c mos2 has the capability to quickly convert nir light to heat energy 45 c thereby being able to activate pds to generate hydroxyl and sulfate radicals the observed reaction rate of carbamazepine degradation by nir mos2 pds process is 6 5 times of that in mos2 pds and even 2 6 times higher than the sum of those in nir mos2 mos2 pds and nir pds processes combining with theoretical calculation and oxidation species analysis a new photo activation pds mechanism is proposed in which mos2 absorbs the energy of light to generate heat energy for overcoming the energy barrier of pds activation by loading mos2 on carbon cloths a flexible photothermal membrane is designed for practical application of sunlight to heat conversion to activate pds with high efficiency stability and recycling the present results demonstrate the potential of applying light to heat conversion in fenton like processes in pollution control which opens new avenues towards utilization of inexhaustible solar energy and novel approaches for environmental remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords light to heat conversion peroxydisulfate near infrared light mos2 membrane 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops like fenton ozone and persulfate etc can in situ produce highly reactive radicals oh and so4 to abate a wide range of organic pollutants in water which has attracted great interests among researchers in recent decades hodges et al 2018 among these aops peroxydisulfate pds based aops not only overcome the potential dangers of o3 and h2o2 during use and transportation but also generate the radicals of so4 which exhibits stronger oxidizing capability e0 so4 so4 2 2 5 3 0 v at a wide ph range 3 9 niu et al 2020 yin et al 2019 furthermore in comparison with other traditional oxidants including h2o2 o3 potassium ferrate and peroxymonosulfate pms pds has following advantages the cheapest price with same quality the longest lifetime in water and the lowest activation energy table s1 wacławek et al 2017 yin et al 2020 thus pds is capable of degrading highly toxic and persistent pollutants and is the first choice for in situ chemical oxidation isco treatment for water or soil avetta et al 2015 chu et al 2019 kang et al 2019 ke et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 generally pds can be physically activated by external energy including uv heat and ultrasound eq 1 or chemically activated by transition metals or chemical activation agents eq 2 to generate so4 duan et al 2018 nie et al 2019 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 compare with the chemical activation of pds to generate one mole of so4 for each mole pds the physical activation pathway results in the symmetrical cleavage of the peroxide bond results in yielding stoichiometrically two moles of so4 for the decomposition of each mole pds which minimizes the consumption of pds and avoids the metal leaching to cause secondary contamination lee et al 2020 however the physical activation are generated from the external energy such as electrical energy these multiple transformations bring energy loss as well as high cost thus from economic and environmentally friendly viewpoints a green and sustainable method yet highly efficient is required for the activation of pds 1 s 2 o 8 2 exte rnal ener gy heat ultr asou nd and uv 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 e s o 4 s o 4 2 solar energy is the free cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source recently tremendous advances have been made in the photo activated pds by using uv or visible light driven photocatalytic techniques in the solar radiation spectrum uv light visible light and near infrared nir light are account for ca 5 48 and 44 respectively liu et al 2016 many of the researches concentrate on exploring the photo involved reactions in the uv or visible light less than 600 nm region while ignore the half solar energy the nir region this is because most of photo involved reactions can not be driven by nir moreover nir energy always brings strong thermal effects during photo involved reactions while the researchers try a lot of ways to avoid this thermal effect however is it possible to utilize the thermal effect caused by nir energy for the activation of pds in environmental application based on the fact that pds can be thermally activated fan et al 2015 waldemer et al 2007 as is known light to heat conversion harvesting and converting solar irradiation by photothermal materials into heat for beneficial usage has diversely applied in cancer therapy solar power generation and seawater desalination as well as in some environmental applications li et al 2017 wang et al 2017 for instance the hybrid nanomaterial pt rgo tio2 featuring the broad light wavelength absorption 800 2500 nm was reported to be a highly active photo thermal responsive catalyst for efficient vocs decomposition under nir irradiation li et al 2018 the photo thermal materials could efficiently absorb the energy of light resulting in light to heat conversion thereby increasing reaction temperature when the temperature increases above the light off temperature for the thermocatalytic oxidation the thermocatalytic oxidation reaction can take place for instance fan et al found that as the temperature increased from 40 to 60 c the removal rate of sulfamethazine increased from 20 to 70 of which the value of k obs increased by 21 fold fan et al 2015 thus the light to heat conversion would be an optical alternative for pds activation process as far as we known there is a big knowledge gap in the understanding of the light to heat conversion method for pds activation for environmental remediation which provides a new way for the elimination of requirement on thermal energy from fossil derived fuels therefore it is of great importance and challenge to explore the potential of nir driven light to heat conversion application in pds activation which promotes the utilization of solar energy and opens the possibility of substituting light to heat catalytic reactions for conventional thermalcatalytic redox reactions based on heat from fossil derived fuels for the first time we introduce the light to heat conversion application in pds activation under nir irradiation in this work herein molybdenum disulphide mos2 a typical photo thermal material chou et al 2013 liu et al 2014 is adopted to testify the potential of light to heat conversion in pds activation while the carbamazepine cbz an antiepileptic drug and persistent organic micropollutant is chosen as the target pollutant remarkably the reaction solution temperature increased up to 45 c under the irradiation of a 808 nm laser in which the localized heat converted from light energy directly activate pds to enhance the removal efficiency of cbz based on both the experimental and theoretical evidence we reveal that the highly efficient catalytic activity originates from solar light driven thermocatalysis that was considerably enhanced by a conceptually novel photoactivation effect different from conventional photocatalysis this work highlights that the light to heat conversion shows promise for redox catalysis applications which will open new avenues toward the utilization of inexhaustible solar energy for environmental remediation 2 materials

carried out in the brown quartz bottle with 2 0 ml solution on magnetic stirrers first mos2 was added into the solution with cbz and stirred for 30 min to achieve adsorption equilibrium then the activation process was initiated by adding a certain amount of pds and turning on the nir light to the solution each experiment was done in duplicate to calculate the average values for

on first principle quantum mechanics ao et al 2008 delley 1990 2000 segall et al 2002 generalized gradient approximation gga with perdew burke ernzerhof pbe method was used as the exchange correlation function hammer et al 1999 liao et al 2012 perdew et al 1996 spin polarization was included in all calculations and a damped van der waals correction was incorporated using grimme s scheme to describe the non bonding interactions du et al 2012 the k point sampled the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone was increased until the calculated energy converges within the required tolerance ao et al 2009 in this work k point was set to 5 5 1 for all slabs which has an energy convergence tolerance of 1 10 5 ha atom for scf self consistent filed procedure with a maximum force of 0 002 ha å 4 9 å global orbital cutoff were used in all calculations in order to better simulate the experimental environment water solvation model cosmo with a dielectric constant of 78 54 was used during all the calculations to mimic the aqueous condition in addition the calculations on systems including pds were given charge 2 e to consider the charge state of s2o8 2 in the simulation a single layer 4 4 1 supercell of mos2 with a vacuum width of 30 å was constructed to ensure the interaction between the repeated slabs along the normal of surface as weak as possible ao et al 2009 all atoms were allowed to relax for all energy calculation the favorable structure of s2o8 2 adsorption on mos2 for calculations is shown in fig s1 a while fig s1 b is the band structure of pristine mos2 the bandgap e g is 1 747 ev which is consistent to the reported experiment result of 1 595 ev and 1 60 2 07 ev mombrú et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 based on dft calculations the results of vibrational analysis or hessian evaluation can be used to calculate enthalpy h entropy s gibbs free energy g and heat capacity at a constant pressure as a function of temperature t thus gibbs free energy of the system before and after adsorption can be obtained the difference of gibbs free energy in s2o8 2 adsorption δ g adsorption can be expressed as 3 δ g adsorption t g mo s 2 s 2 o 8 2 t g mo s 2 t g s 2 o 8 2 t while the s2o8 2 activation process of gibbs free energy difference δ g activation could be determined by eq 4 4 δ g activation t g fs t g is t where g fs t and g is t are respectively the corresponding gibbs free energies of fs and is configurations in fig 5 after calibration by zero point vibrational energy zpve of the system note that the initial structure and final structure in the activation progress are defined as is and fs using the two equations mentioned above the adsorption and activation temperatures for this system can be predicted thus the activation of s2o8 2 to so4 on mos2 occurs when the temperature reaches a certain value at the ideal state with the infinite reaction time in order to obtain more accurate activation performance the relationship between reaction time τ and temperature t is estimated by the following equation jiang et al 2014 5 τ 1 υ e e b a r k b t where υ is the frequency of o o bond of so4 o4s in pds s2o8 2 k b is the boltzmann s constant 8 62 10 5 ev k e b a r is energy barrier for s2o8 2 activation the values of υ and e b a r can be obtained through dft calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation on the effect of temperature for pds activation in pollutant degradation firstly cbz degradation in the heat activated pds process under different temperature by the water bath was tested shown in fig 1 a it is observed that the removal efficiency of cbz was enhanced with the increase of the temperature when the temperature was above 50 c cbz could be completely decomposed in 4 h by the heat activated pds process for the pds can be efficiently activated at 50 c for almost complete degradation of cbz the enhancement on the degradation percentage of cbz is not obvious when the temperature is above 50 c in order to understand the kinetic performance of pds activation at different temperature eq 5 is used to predict the reaction time at different temperature in eq 5 the frequency υ of o o bond of so4 o4s is unknown which can be determined by frequency calculation here fig 1 b and 1 c exhibit the vibration frequencies of o o along different directions of 20 006 and 23 478 thz respectively the average of the two values 21 742 thz is taken as the frequency υ of o o bond and used in eq 5 the calculated reaction time at different temperature is shown in fig 1 d as shown τ t decreases exponentially with t increasing it indicates that the reaction time is 0 165 s at room temperature when t increases to 50 c the reaction is facilitated significantly and only needs 0 018 s in addition further increasing the temperature above 50 c the reaction time does not reduce much the calculated result is in accordance with the experimental result of heat activated pds it can be seen that the increase of the temperature can strongly improve the rates of pds activation below 50 c in which the rates of pds activation at 50 c is 9 2 times to that at room temperature the result indicated that the pds could be efficiently activated through increasing the temperature of the solution thus next we take advantage of the mos2 materials to transfer light to heat to increase the temperature of solution which promotes pds activation for the removal of the pollutants 3 2 light to heat conversion potential of mos2 then mos2 was characterized to evaluate its ability in light to heat conversion as shown in fig s2 a xrd pattern of mos2 was obtained the intense diffraction peaks at 17 6 32 9 35 9 and 57 5 correspond to the reflection of 011 100 103 and 110 planes of mos2 respectively which are all compatible with those reported for mos2 in jcpds card no 37 1492 standard khataee et al 2018 fig 2 a shows the tem image of as prepared mos2 which is found that the mos2 showed thin 2d structures with lateral dimension dispersions the xps spectra of mo 3d and s 2p are shown in fig s2 b and c two characteristic peaks at 232 6 and 235 7 ev were corresponded to mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 respectively as shown in fig s2 b fig s2 c showed that the characteristic peaks at 162 5 and 168 8 ev were corresponded to s 2p3 2 and s 2p1 2 respectively uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs measurement was performed to evaluate the optical response of the catalysts as shown in fig 2 b mos2 exhibits a strong absorption in the entire region of the full solar spectrum from 200 to 2000 nm which includes uv visible light and nir light the characterization data suggested that as prepared mos2 has good photothermal conversion ability to further testify the photothermal conversion ability of mos2 infrared camera was used to record the temperatures of the solution under different mos2 concentration by nir irradiation fig 2 c the plots of the temperature change were shown in fig 2 d and fig s3 it can be seen that the mos2 could strongly increase the temperature of the solution for instance when the mos2 concentrations were 1 0 g l 1 the temperatures of the solution under nir irradiation reached at 45 c in 5 min compared with 30 c in the absence of mos2 moreover the temperature of the solution also increased with the increment of mos2 concentration when the mos2 concentrations were 0 10 0 50 and 2 0 g l 1 the temperatures of the solution reached at 38 40 and 55 c in 5 min fig s3 respectively the results suggested that mos2 could absorb the energy of nir to transfer to heat energy for further application thus next pds activation through photo thermal conversion by mos2 under nir irradiation for pollutant removal is assessed 3 3 performance and kinetics of pds activation by mos2 under nir irradiation to testify the oxidation potential of the nir mos2 pds process batch experiments are conducted for cbz degradation in different comparative oxidation processes including nir mos2 mos2 pds nir pds and nir mos2 pds processes respectively as shown in fig 3 a the photo catalytic process of mos2 under nir irradiation showed negligible removal of cbz 10 suggesting that the energy of nir was unable to stimulate mos2 to degrade cbz by the sole photo catalytic process without pds meanwhile mos2 alone and nir alone displayed limited pds activation ability with the removal percentage of cbz was 27 7 and 25 7 in mos2 pds and nir pds systems respectively significantly the removal efficiency of cbz reached at 81 5 with the whole access of nir mos2 and pds it was observed that the nir mos2 pds processes showed much higher cbz degradation efficiency than those of nir mos2 mos2 pds and nir pds system of which was even higher than the sum of the efficiencies for the nir mos2 mos2 pds and nir pds systems the results indicated that there was a joint action between the nir and mos2 which played a synergistic effect on pds activation for efficient cbz removal considering the characteristics of the nir irradiation and photo thermal transformation of mos2 material the joint action between the nir and mos2 would possibly be the effect of light to heat conversion moreover the temperature of the mos2 pds nir pds and nir mos2 pds processes were tested as 25 30 and 45 c respectively which further indicated the light to heat conversion effect between nir and mos2 for pds activation thus the light to heat conversion between nir and mos2 played important effect on pds activation and showed high application potential in pollutants removal moreover the observed pseudo first order rates of the processes were modeled in fig 3 b in which the nir mos2 nir pds mos2 pds and nir mos2 pds processes were calculated to be 0 001 0 005 0 004 and 0 026 min 1 respectively the observed reaction rate of the nir mos2 pds process is 6 5 times to that of the mos2 pds process according to the calculation result of fig 1 d the temperature of the mos2 pds and nir mos2 pds processes are 25 and 45 c corresponding with the pds activation time are 0 165 and 0 027 s respectively it is concluded that the activation rate was improved 6 1 times with the assistance of nir irradiation theoretically which agrees with the experimental results that the observed rate of nir mos2 pds process is 6 5 times to that of the mos2 pds process it further demonstrated that the light to heat activation was the dominant way for pds activation in the nir mos2 pds process additionally the degradation of cbz in the nir mos2 pds process was compared with that in the heat activated pds process at 45 c shown in fig s4 the degradation performance of cbz in the heat activated pds process was slightly higher than that in the nir mos2 pds process in which the observed rate constant of cbz degradation in the heat activated pds process was 2 2 times to that in the nir mos2 pds process insert of fig s4 this might attribute to that the heat activated pds process was always maintained at 45 c while the nir mos2 pds process relied on the mos2 to absorb the energy from light to achieve 45 c whereas the light to heat induced pds activation that largely depended on the photo thermal transfer ability cannot obtain the activation energy as far as heat activated pds process however the nir mos2 pds process can develop an environmentally friendly way to use the ultimate solar light energy to replace the traditional heating ways by electricity or fuels as well as can simultaneously obtain an efficient pollutants removal performance these results demonstrated that the mos2 could efficiently transfer the light to heat under nir irradiation to increase the reaction temperature thus largely enhance the pds activation rates for fast pollutants degradation 3 4 oxidation mechanism of the light to heat conversion process to elucidate the oxidation mechanisms in the different comparative systems the reactive oxidation species ros were primarily investigated through the radical quenching studies fig 4 a displayed that the addition of tert butyl alcohol tba at a molar ratio of 200 1 to pds concentration largely inhibited the removal efficiency of cbz while the methanol meoh at the same molar ratio showed almost complete quenching effect on the cbz degradation in the nir mos2 pds process the results indicated that the nir mos2 pds process was a radical oxidation process that consisted of hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals however the tba and meoh showed little effects on the cbz degradation in both the mos2 pds and nir pds systems shown in fig s5 the results suggested that the hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals were not the main ros in both mos2 pds and nir pds systems which was totally inconsistent with the nir mos2 pds process furthermore epr studies were carried out to demonstrate the ros generated in these oxidation systems the results are shown in fig 4 b no characteristic peaks of radicals were found in both mos2 pds and nir pds systems however in the nir mos2 pds process the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were both observed indicating that corresponding with the results of quenching studies the so4 and oh were generated in the nir mos2 pds process to reveal the transformation of the s2o8 2 activation for so4 and oh generation pds activation pathway on mos2 was investigated by transition state search calculation and the result is shown in fig 4 c the lengths of middle o o bond in is ts and fs are 1 481 å 2 568 å and 3 553 å respectively during the activation process the bond distance is stretched until it breaks to generate two so4 it is found that the corresponding energy barrier for activating s2o8 2 into so4 is 0 743 ev in addition the relative energy of fs is 0 449 ev which is higher than that of is this phenomenon demonstrates that s2o8 2 activation on mos2 is not thermodynamically spontaneous therefore external energy such as heat is required to overcome the energy barrier for s2o8 2 activation in addition the spin density of fs is calculated to confirm the possible generation of so4 and the result is shown in fig 4 d where shows that the two so4 has strong spin state indicating s2o8 2 activated into so4 radicals on mos2 therefore so4 was demonstrated to generate in this pds activation process according to the previous studies the pds could be activated to generate so4 then so4 could transfer to oh quickly through the following reaction 6 s o 4 h 2 o o h s o 4 2 h according to the results of ros determination and ros calculation the oxidation mechanism of the nir mos2 pds process was a radical oxidation process that consisted of hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals which was totally different with the mos2 pds and nir pds systems moreover the ros in the heat pds process at 45 c was also determined in which the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were found the results indicated that the oxidation mechanism of the nir mos2 pds process was similar to the heat activated pds process which further verified the heat activation was the main activation pathway of the nir mos2 pds process therefore it was deeply confirmed that the heat generated from light to heat conversion between nir and mos2 played important role on pds activation for pollutants removal next dft calculations are adopted to verify the possibility of the light to heat conversion by mos2 for pds activation 3 5 the difference of gibbs free energies for pds activation by mos2 at different temperature it is known that the energy barrier in transition state search calculation is at the condition of 0 k to take into consideration the effect of temperature the difference of gibbs free energies δ g for s2o8 2 adsorption on mos2 and s2o8 2 activation into so4 as a function of temperature are established with the atomistic thermodynamics described in eq 3 and 4 g s 2 o 8 2 t g mo s 2 t g mo s 2 s 2 o 8 2 t and δ gadsorption t after calibration were plotted in fig 5 a and 5 c while fig 5 b and 5 d illustrate the gibbs free energy for s2o8 2 activation into so4 the specific values after calibration at different temperatures are listed in tables s2 and s3 of supporting information the results show that g s 2 o 8 2 t g mo s 2 t g mo s 2 s 2 o 8 2 t and δ gadsorption t decreases as t increases and δ gadsorption becomes negative at t ads 38 82 k where t ads acquired by linear fitting method based on the obtained δ gadsorption t values is defined as the adsorption temperature fig 5 c indicates that the s2o8 2 can be adsorbed on mos2 above 38 82 k table s4 in addition δ gactivation t changes from positive value to negative value at 44 99 k as shown in fig 5 d however it turns positive and remains increasing exponentially after 1107 55 k the activation temperature is represented by t act it shows that the activation reaction of s2o8 2 activation to so4 on mos2 can occur at 44 99 k t act 1107 55 k note that δ gactivation reaches minimum at 500k demonstrating the strongest driving force for the activation reaction in addition δ gactivation changes slightly between 300 800k which indicates relatively stable activation performance of mos2 at a wide temperature range however this reaction is at aqueous condition water solution is boiling at 373k i e s2o8 2 activation reaction has optimum performance at 300 373 k based on above results it can be known that the s2o8 2 activation to so4 on mos2 is thermodynamically feasible at the temperature higher than 44 99 k and optimum at 300 373 k in this experiment the mos2 could absorb the nir light to increase the temperature of the solution to 318k which reached the optimum temperature range of pds activation by mos2 the results indicated that the mos2 could absorb the nir light to improve the temperature of the solution to decrease the energy gap of pds activation and thus promote pds activation performance by mos2 the above results and discussion demonstrated that the possibility of the light to heat conversion to enhance pds activation for pollutants by nir irradiation the overall mechanism is illustrated in scheme 1 then the experiments under sunlight are conducted to further evaluate the practical application potential of the light to heat conversion enhanced pds activation process 3 6 practical application of the light to heat conversion enhanced pds activation process the pollutants can be rapidly degraded in the heterogeneous nir mos2 pds process however the highly dispersed suspension is hard to reuse and may induce secondary pollution thus we considered to assemble the mos2 nanosheets into the cc for recycling an experiment on the degradation of methylene blue mb by the cc mos2 pds system under sunlight irradiation was conducted to testify the practical application potential of the light to heat conversion for pollution control the mos2 nanosheets were grown on the highly flexible surface of cc with diameter of 5 cm using a facile solvothermal method to form a cc mos2 membrane as shown in the sem image of the cc mos2 membrane fig 6 a the crimped mos2 nanosheet with high density were grown on the surface of cc forming a 3d hierarchical shape higher magnification sem image from fig 6 b and fig s6 displayed that numerous mos2 nanosheets were grown on the surface of cc compared with the raw cc fig 6 c which enabled the cc mos2 membrane to afford active sites for efficiently transferring the light to heat energy the photo of raw cc fresh cc mos2 membrane and used cc mos2 membrane were displayed in fig 6 d f while the mass of the raw cc and the fresh cc mos2 membrane was shown in fig 6 g indicating the successful growing of mos2 on the surface of cc 20 ml of the mb solution at 10 mg l 1 and pds were added in a quartz beaker after placing the cc mos2 membrane the beaker was taken under the sunlight with light intensity at about 50 mw cm 2 to start the experiment the temperature of the solution is about 41 c fig 6 h it can be seen that the mb could be efficiently decolorized fig 6 i the cc mos2 membrane was reused for mb degradation fig 6 j results showed the cc mos2 membrane can be easily recycled and reused and stably remove the mb even in 10 cycles which would not cause high cost and secondary contamination to the environment this superior decolorization of mb should be primarily ascribed to the high light to heat transfer ability of the cc mos2 membrane to improve the reaction temperature to efficiently activate pds to generate radicals based on the high removal efficiency stability and low cost we propose that the light to heat induced pds activation process is an ideal system to degrade organic contaminants for environmental remediation and solar energy application 4 conclusion in summary the utilization of renewable solar energy via light driven thermocatalysis offers a potential alternative strategy for environmental remediation the mos2 could efficiently absorb the energy of light resulting in light to heat conversion thereby increasing reaction temperature for driving the pds activation in the removal of pollutants after the light to heat conversion the oxidation ability of fenton like processes was largely improved the potential of the light to heat conversion application in the pds activation and its oxidation mechanism are deeply elucidated from the view point of both experimental and theoretical aspects which offers the foundation and direction for the future research on the light to heat conversion application in the fenton like or other oxidation processes however the light to heat induced pds activation largely depended on the photo thermal transfer ability of the materials even though the mos2 can absorb the energy from light to transfer to heat the transfer efficiency and rate are not high enough to achieve the comparable performance of that in the heat activated pds process thus in the future study we will take effort in coupling a good catalyst with strong absorption of light to heat to produce much enhancement in the degradation of organic pollutants the light to heat induced fenton like oxidation process should be an ideal oxidation system to degrade organic contaminants for environmental remediation and solar energy application it is anticipated that this work may enable the wide development of the solar energy application to open up a novel strategy for environmental purification

17271,the advantage of light to heat conversion can be employed as an optical alternative for environmental remediation as a proof of concept for the first time we introduce the light to heat conversion application in peroxydisulfate pds activation by molybdenum disulphide mos2 under near infrared nir light irradiation theoretical kinetics analysis suggests that the reaction rates of pds activation is increased up to 9 2 times when increasing from room temperature to 50 c mos2 has the capability to quickly convert nir light to heat energy 45 c thereby being able to activate pds to generate hydroxyl and sulfate radicals the observed reaction rate of carbamazepine degradation by nir mos2 pds process is 6 5 times of that in mos2 pds and even 2 6 times higher than the sum of those in nir mos2 mos2 pds and nir pds processes combining with theoretical calculation and oxidation species analysis a new photo activation pds mechanism is proposed in which mos2 absorbs the energy of light to generate heat energy for overcoming the energy barrier of pds activation by loading mos2 on carbon cloths a flexible photothermal membrane is designed for practical application of sunlight to heat conversion to activate pds with high efficiency stability and recycling the present results demonstrate the potential of applying light to heat conversion in fenton like processes in pollution control which opens new avenues towards utilization of inexhaustible solar energy and novel approaches for environmental remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords light to heat conversion peroxydisulfate near infrared light mos2 membrane 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops like fenton ozone and persulfate etc can in situ produce highly reactive radicals oh and so4 to abate a wide range of organic pollutants in water which has attracted great interests among researchers in recent decades hodges et al 2018 among these aops peroxydisulfate pds based aops not only overcome the potential dangers of o3 and h2o2 during use and transportation but also generate the radicals of so4 which exhibits stronger oxidizing capability e0 so4 so4 2 2 5 3 0 v at a wide ph range 3 9 niu et al 2020 yin et al 2019 furthermore in comparison with other traditional oxidants including h2o2 o3 potassium ferrate and peroxymonosulfate pms pds has following advantages the cheapest price with same quality the longest lifetime in water and the lowest activation energy table s1 wacławek et al 2017 yin et al 2020 thus pds is capable of degrading highly toxic and persistent pollutants and is the first choice for in situ chemical oxidation isco treatment for water or soil avetta et al 2015 chu et al 2019 kang et al 2019 ke et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 generally pds can be physically activated by external energy including uv heat and ultrasound eq 1 or chemically activated by transition metals or chemical activation agents eq 2 to generate so4 duan et al 2018 nie et al 2019 yin et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 compare with the chemical activation of pds to generate one mole of so4 for each mole pds the physical activation pathway results in the symmetrical cleavage of the peroxide bond results in yielding stoichiometrically two moles of so4 for the decomposition of each mole pds which minimizes the consumption of pds and avoids the metal leaching to cause secondary contamination lee et al 2020 however the physical activation are generated from the external energy such as electrical energy these multiple transformations bring energy loss as well as high cost thus from economic and environmentally friendly viewpoints a green and sustainable method yet highly efficient is required for the activation of pds 1 s 2 o 8 2 exte rnal ener gy heat ultr asou nd and uv 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 e s o 4 s o 4 2 solar energy is the free cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source recently tremendous advances have been made in the photo activated pds by using uv or visible light driven photocatalytic techniques in the solar radiation spectrum uv light visible light and near infrared nir light are account for ca 5 48 and 44 respectively liu et al 2016 many of the researches concentrate on exploring the photo involved reactions in the uv or visible light less than 600 nm region while ignore the half solar energy the nir region this is because most of photo involved reactions can not be driven by nir moreover nir energy always brings strong thermal effects during photo involved reactions while the researchers try a lot of ways to avoid this thermal effect however is it possible to utilize the thermal effect caused by nir energy for the activation of pds in environmental application based on the fact that pds can be thermally activated fan et al 2015 waldemer et al 2007 as is known light to heat conversion harvesting and converting solar irradiation by photothermal materials into heat for beneficial usage has diversely applied in cancer therapy solar power generation and seawater desalination as well as in some environmental applications li et al 2017 wang et al 2017 for instance the hybrid nanomaterial pt rgo tio2 featuring the broad light wavelength absorption 800 2500 nm was reported to be a highly active photo thermal responsive catalyst for efficient vocs decomposition under nir irradiation li et al 2018 the photo thermal materials could efficiently absorb the energy of light resulting in light to heat conversion thereby increasing reaction temperature when the temperature increases above the light off temperature for the thermocatalytic oxidation the thermocatalytic oxidation reaction can take place for instance fan et al found that as the temperature increased from 40 to 60 c the removal rate of sulfamethazine increased from 20 to 70 of which the value of k obs increased by 21 fold fan et al 2015 thus the light to heat conversion would be an optical alternative for pds activation process as far as we known there is a big knowledge gap in the understanding of the light to heat conversion method for pds activation for environmental remediation which provides a new way for the elimination of requirement on thermal energy from fossil derived fuels therefore it is of great importance and challenge to explore the potential of nir driven light to heat conversion application in pds activation which promotes the utilization of solar energy and opens the possibility of substituting light to heat catalytic reactions for conventional thermalcatalytic redox reactions based on heat from fossil derived fuels for the first time we introduce the light to heat conversion application in pds activation under nir irradiation in this work herein molybdenum disulphide mos2 a typical photo thermal material chou et al 2013 liu et al 2014 is adopted to testify the potential of light to heat conversion in pds activation while the carbamazepine cbz an antiepileptic drug and persistent organic micropollutant is chosen as the target pollutant remarkably the reaction solution temperature increased up to 45 c under the irradiation of a 808 nm laser in which the localized heat converted from light energy directly activate pds to enhance the removal efficiency of cbz based on both the experimental and theoretical evidence we reveal that the highly efficient catalytic activity originates from solar light driven thermocatalysis that was considerably enhanced by a conceptually novel photoactivation effect different from conventional photocatalysis this work highlights that the light to heat conversion shows promise for redox catalysis applications which will open new avenues toward the utilization of inexhaustible solar energy for environmental remediation 2 materials

synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method 0 25 mmol of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and 0 75 mmol of ch4n2s were added into the water ethanol mixtures vwater vethanol 5 1 with ultrasonication for 1 h then the homogeneous solution was transferred into a 100 ml teflon autoclave and kept at a temperature of 210 c for 24 h after that the obtained black precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol for 3 times respectively and then dried in an oven at 60 c for 12 h to reuse the catalysts easily the mos2 nanosheets were grown on the highly flexible surface of

global orbital cutoff were used in all calculations in order to better simulate the experimental environment water solvation model cosmo with a dielectric constant of 78 54 was used during all the calculations to mimic the aqueous condition in addition the calculations on systems including pds were given charge 2 e to consider the charge state of s2o8 2 in the simulation a single layer 4 4 1 supercell of mos2 with a vacuum width of 30 å was constructed to ensure the interaction between the repeated slabs along the normal of surface as weak as possible ao et al 2009 all atoms were allowed to relax for all energy calculation the favorable structure of s2o8 2 adsorption on mos2 for calculations is shown in fig s1 a while fig s1 b is the band structure of pristine mos2 the bandgap e g is 1 747 ev which is consistent to the reported experiment result of 1 595 ev and 1 60 2 07 ev mombrú et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 based on dft calculations the results of vibrational analysis or hessian evaluation can be used to calculate enthalpy h entropy s gibbs free energy g and heat capacity at a constant pressure as a function of temperature t thus gibbs free energy of the system before and after adsorption can be obtained the difference of gibbs free energy in s2o8 2 adsorption δ g adsorption can be expressed as 3 δ g adsorption t g mo s 2 s 2 o 8 2 t g mo s 2 t g s 2 o 8 2 t while the s2o8 2 activation process of gibbs free energy difference δ g activation could be determined by eq 4 4 δ g activation t g fs t g is t where g fs t and g is t are respectively the corresponding gibbs free energies of fs and is configurations in fig 5 after calibration by zero point vibrational energy zpve of the system note that the initial structure and final structure in the activation progress are defined as is and fs using the two equations mentioned above the adsorption and activation temperatures for this system can be predicted thus the activation of s2o8 2 to so4 on mos2 occurs when the temperature reaches a certain value at the ideal state with the infinite reaction time in order to obtain more accurate activation performance the relationship between reaction time τ and temperature t is estimated by the following equation jiang et al 2014 5 τ 1 υ e e b a r k b t where υ is the frequency of o o bond of so4 o4s in pds s2o8 2 k b is the boltzmann s constant 8 62 10 5 ev k e b a r is energy barrier for s2o8 2 activation the values of υ and e b a r can be obtained through dft calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation on the effect of temperature for pds activation in pollutant degradation firstly cbz degradation in the heat activated pds process under different temperature by the water bath was tested shown in fig 1 a it is observed that the removal efficiency of cbz was enhanced with the increase of the temperature when the temperature was above 50 c cbz could be completely decomposed in 4 h by the heat activated pds process for the pds can be efficiently activated at 50 c for almost complete degradation of cbz the enhancement on the degradation percentage of cbz is not obvious when the temperature is above 50 c in order to understand the kinetic performance of pds activation at different temperature eq 5 is used to predict the reaction time at different temperature in eq 5 the frequency υ of o o bond of so4 o4s is unknown which can be determined by frequency calculation here fig 1 b and 1 c exhibit the vibration frequencies of o o along different directions of 20 006 and 23 478 thz respectively the average of the two values 21 742 thz is taken as the frequency υ of o o bond and used in eq 5 the calculated reaction time at different temperature is shown in fig 1 d as shown τ t decreases exponentially with t increasing it indicates that the reaction time is 0 165 s at room temperature when t increases to 50 c the reaction is facilitated significantly and only needs 0 018 s in addition further increasing the temperature above 50 c the reaction time does not reduce much the calculated result is in accordance with the experimental result of heat activated pds it can be seen that the increase of the temperature can strongly improve the rates of pds activation below 50 c in which the rates of pds activation at 50 c is 9 2 times to that at room temperature the result indicated that the pds could be efficiently activated through increasing the temperature of the solution thus next we take advantage of the mos2 materials to transfer light to heat to increase the temperature of solution which promotes pds activation for the removal of the pollutants 3 2 light to heat conversion potential of mos2 then mos2 was characterized to evaluate its ability in light to heat conversion as shown in fig s2 a xrd pattern of mos2 was obtained the intense diffraction peaks at 17 6 32 9 35 9 and 57 5 correspond to the reflection of 011 100 103 and 110 planes of mos2 respectively which are all compatible with those reported for mos2 in jcpds card no 37 1492 standard khataee et al 2018 fig 2 a shows the tem image of as prepared mos2 which is found that the mos2 showed thin 2d structures with lateral dimension dispersions the xps spectra of mo 3d and s 2p are shown in fig s2 b and c two characteristic peaks at 232 6 and 235 7 ev were corresponded to mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 respectively as shown in fig s2 b fig s2 c showed that the characteristic peaks at 162 5 and 168 8 ev were corresponded to s 2p3 2 and s 2p1 2 respectively uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs measurement was performed to evaluate the optical response of the catalysts as shown in fig 2 b mos2 exhibits a strong absorption in the entire region of the full solar spectrum from 200 to 2000 nm which includes uv visible light and nir light the characterization data suggested that as prepared mos2 has good photothermal conversion ability to further testify the photothermal conversion ability of mos2 infrared camera was used to record the temperatures of the solution under different mos2 concentration by nir irradiation fig 2 c the plots of the temperature change were shown in fig 2 d and fig s3 it can be seen that the mos2 could strongly increase the temperature of the solution for instance when the mos2 concentrations were 1 0 g l 1 the temperatures of the solution under nir irradiation reached at 45 c in 5 min compared with 30 c in the absence of mos2 moreover the temperature of the solution also increased with the increment of mos2 concentration when the mos2 concentrations were 0 10 0 50 and 2 0 g l 1 the temperatures of the solution reached at 38 40 and 55 c in 5 min fig s3 respectively the results suggested that mos2 could absorb the energy of nir to transfer to heat energy for further application thus next pds activation through photo thermal conversion by mos2 under nir irradiation for pollutant removal is assessed 3 3 performance and kinetics of pds activation by mos2 under nir irradiation to testify the oxidation potential of the nir mos2 pds process batch experiments are conducted for cbz degradation in different comparative oxidation processes including nir mos2 mos2 pds nir pds and nir mos2 pds processes respectively as shown in fig 3 a the photo catalytic process of mos2 under nir irradiation showed negligible removal of cbz 10 suggesting that the energy of nir was unable to stimulate mos2 to degrade cbz by the sole photo catalytic process without pds meanwhile mos2 alone and nir alone displayed limited pds activation ability with the removal percentage of cbz was 27 7 and 25 7 in mos2 pds and nir pds systems respectively significantly the removal efficiency of cbz reached at 81 5 with the whole access of nir mos2 and pds it was observed that the nir mos2 pds processes showed much higher cbz degradation efficiency than those of nir mos2 mos2 pds and nir pds system of which was even higher than the sum of the efficiencies for the nir mos2 mos2 pds and nir pds systems the results indicated that there was a joint action between the nir and mos2 which played a synergistic effect on pds activation for efficient cbz removal considering the characteristics of the nir irradiation and photo thermal transformation of mos2 material the joint action between the nir and mos2 would possibly be the effect of light to heat conversion moreover the temperature of the mos2 pds nir pds and nir mos2 pds processes were tested as 25 30 and 45 c respectively which further indicated the light to heat conversion effect between nir and mos2 for pds activation thus the light to heat conversion between nir and mos2 played important effect on pds activation and showed high application potential in pollutants removal moreover the observed pseudo first order rates of the processes were modeled in fig 3 b in which the nir mos2 nir pds mos2 pds and nir mos2 pds processes were calculated to be 0 001 0 005 0 004 and 0 026 min 1 respectively the observed reaction rate of the nir mos2 pds process is 6 5 times to that of the mos2 pds process according to the calculation result of fig 1 d the temperature of the mos2 pds and nir mos2 pds processes are 25 and 45 c corresponding with the pds activation time are 0 165 and 0 027 s respectively it is concluded that the activation rate was improved 6 1 times with the assistance of nir irradiation theoretically which agrees with the experimental results that the observed rate of nir mos2 pds process is 6 5 times to that of the mos2 pds process it further demonstrated that the light to heat activation was the dominant way for pds activation in the nir mos2 pds process additionally the degradation of cbz in the nir mos2 pds process was compared with that in the heat activated pds process at 45 c shown in fig s4 the degradation performance of cbz in the heat activated pds process was slightly higher than that in the nir mos2 pds process in which the observed rate constant of cbz degradation in the heat activated pds process was 2 2 times to that in the nir mos2 pds process insert of fig s4 this might attribute to that the heat activated pds process was always maintained at 45 c while the nir mos2 pds process relied on the mos2 to absorb the energy from light to achieve 45 c whereas the light to heat induced pds activation that largely depended on the photo thermal transfer ability cannot obtain the activation energy as far as heat activated pds process however the nir mos2 pds process can develop an environmentally friendly way to use the ultimate solar light energy to replace the traditional heating ways by electricity or fuels as well as can simultaneously obtain an efficient pollutants removal performance these results demonstrated that the mos2 could efficiently transfer the light to heat under nir irradiation to increase the reaction temperature thus largely enhance the pds activation rates for fast pollutants degradation 3 4 oxidation mechanism of the light to heat conversion process to elucidate the oxidation mechanisms in the different comparative systems the reactive oxidation species ros were primarily investigated through the radical quenching studies fig 4 a displayed that the addition of tert butyl alcohol tba at a molar ratio of 200 1 to pds concentration largely inhibited the removal efficiency of cbz while the methanol meoh at the same molar ratio showed almost complete quenching effect on the cbz degradation in the nir mos2 pds process the results indicated that the nir mos2 pds process was a radical oxidation process that consisted of hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals however the tba and meoh showed little effects on the cbz degradation in both the mos2 pds and nir pds systems shown in fig s5 the results suggested that the hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals were not the main ros in both mos2 pds and nir pds systems which was totally inconsistent with the nir mos2 pds process furthermore epr studies were carried out to demonstrate the ros generated in these oxidation systems the results are shown in fig 4 b no characteristic peaks of radicals were found in both mos2 pds and nir pds systems however in the nir mos2 pds process the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were both observed indicating that corresponding with the results of quenching studies the so4 and oh were generated in the nir mos2 pds process to reveal the transformation of the s2o8 2 activation for so4 and oh generation pds activation pathway on mos2 was investigated by transition state search calculation and the result is shown in fig 4 c the lengths of middle o o bond in is ts and fs are 1 481 å 2 568 å and 3 553 å respectively during the activation process the bond distance is stretched until it breaks to generate two so4 it is found that the corresponding energy barrier for activating s2o8 2 into so4 is 0 743 ev in addition the relative energy of fs is 0 449 ev which is higher than that of is this phenomenon demonstrates that s2o8 2 activation on mos2 is not thermodynamically spontaneous therefore external energy such as heat is required to overcome the energy barrier for s2o8 2 activation in addition the spin density of fs is calculated to confirm the possible generation of so4 and the result is shown in fig 4 d where shows that the two so4 has strong spin state indicating s2o8 2 activated into so4 radicals on mos2 therefore so4 was demonstrated to generate in this pds activation process according to the previous studies the pds could be activated to generate so4 then so4 could transfer to oh quickly through the following reaction 6 s o 4 h 2 o o h s o 4 2 h according to the results of ros determination and ros calculation the oxidation mechanism of the nir mos2 pds process was a radical oxidation process that consisted of hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals which was totally different with the mos2 pds and nir pds systems moreover the ros in the heat pds process at 45 c was also determined in which the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were found the results indicated that the oxidation mechanism of the nir mos2 pds process was similar to the heat activated pds process which further verified the heat activation was the main activation pathway of the nir mos2 pds process therefore it was deeply confirmed that the heat generated from light to heat conversion between nir and mos2 played important role on pds activation for pollutants removal next dft calculations are adopted to verify the possibility of the light to heat conversion by mos2 for pds activation 3 5 the difference of gibbs free energies for pds activation by mos2 at different temperature it is known that the energy barrier in transition state search calculation is at the condition of 0 k to take into consideration the effect of temperature the difference of gibbs free energies δ g for s2o8 2 adsorption on mos2 and s2o8 2 activation into so4 as a function of temperature are established with the atomistic thermodynamics described in eq 3 and 4 g s 2 o 8 2 t g mo s 2 t g mo s 2 s 2 o 8 2 t and δ gadsorption t after calibration were plotted in fig 5 a and 5 c while fig 5 b and 5 d illustrate the gibbs free energy for s2o8 2 activation into so4 the specific values after calibration at different temperatures are listed in tables s2 and s3 of supporting information the results show that g s 2 o 8 2 t g mo s 2 t g mo s 2 s 2 o 8 2 t and δ gadsorption t decreases as t increases and δ gadsorption becomes negative at t ads 38 82 k where t ads acquired by linear fitting method based on the obtained δ gadsorption t values is defined as the adsorption temperature fig 5 c indicates that the s2o8 2 can be adsorbed on mos2 above 38 82 k table s4 in addition δ gactivation t changes from positive value to negative value at 44 99 k as shown in fig 5 d however it turns positive and remains increasing exponentially after 1107 55 k the activation temperature is represented by t act it shows that the activation reaction of s2o8 2 activation to so4 on mos2 can occur at 44 99 k t act 1107 55 k note that δ gactivation reaches minimum at 500k demonstrating the strongest driving force for the activation reaction in addition δ gactivation changes slightly between 300 800k which indicates relatively stable activation performance of mos2 at a wide temperature range however this reaction is at aqueous condition water solution is boiling at 373k i e s2o8 2 activation reaction has optimum performance at 300 373 k based on above results it can be known that the s2o8 2 activation to so4 on mos2 is thermodynamically feasible at the temperature higher than 44 99 k and optimum at 300 373 k in this experiment the mos2 could absorb the nir light to increase the temperature of the solution to 318k which reached the optimum temperature range of pds activation by mos2 the results indicated that the mos2 could absorb the nir light to improve the temperature of the solution to decrease the energy gap of pds activation and thus promote pds activation performance by mos2 the above results and discussion demonstrated that the possibility of the light to heat conversion to enhance pds activation for pollutants by nir irradiation the overall mechanism is illustrated in scheme 1 then the experiments under sunlight are conducted to further evaluate the practical application potential of the light to heat conversion enhanced pds activation process 3 6 practical application of the light to heat conversion enhanced pds activation process the pollutants can be rapidly degraded in the heterogeneous nir mos2 pds process however the highly dispersed suspension is hard to reuse and may induce secondary pollution thus we considered to assemble the mos2 nanosheets into the cc for recycling an experiment on the degradation of methylene blue mb by the cc mos2 pds system under sunlight irradiation was conducted to testify the practical application potential of the light to heat conversion for pollution control the mos2 nanosheets were grown on the highly flexible surface of cc with diameter of 5 cm using a facile solvothermal method to form a cc mos2 membrane as shown in the sem image of the cc mos2 membrane fig 6 a the crimped mos2 nanosheet with high density were grown on the surface of cc forming a 3d hierarchical shape higher magnification sem image from fig 6 b and fig s6 displayed that numerous mos2 nanosheets were grown on the surface of cc compared with the raw cc fig 6 c which enabled the cc mos2 membrane to afford active sites for efficiently transferring the light to heat energy the photo of raw cc fresh cc mos2 membrane and used cc mos2 membrane were displayed in fig 6 d f while the mass of the raw cc and the fresh cc mos2 membrane was shown in fig 6 g indicating the successful growing of mos2 on the surface of cc 20 ml of the mb solution at 10 mg l 1 and pds were added in a quartz beaker after placing the cc mos2 membrane the beaker was taken under the sunlight with light intensity at about 50 mw cm 2 to start the experiment the temperature of the solution is about 41 c fig 6 h it can be seen that the mb could be efficiently decolorized fig 6 i the cc mos2 membrane was reused for mb degradation fig 6 j results showed the cc mos2 membrane can be easily recycled and reused and stably remove the mb even in 10 cycles which would not cause high cost and secondary contamination to the environment this superior decolorization of mb should be primarily ascribed to the high light to heat transfer ability of the cc mos2 membrane to improve the reaction temperature to efficiently activate pds to generate radicals based on the high removal efficiency stability and low cost we propose that the light to heat induced pds activation process is an ideal system to degrade organic contaminants for environmental remediation and solar energy application 4 conclusion in summary the utilization of renewable solar energy via light driven thermocatalysis offers a potential alternative strategy for environmental remediation the mos2 could efficiently absorb the energy of light resulting in light to heat conversion thereby increasing reaction temperature for driving the pds activation in the removal of pollutants after the light to heat conversion the oxidation ability of fenton like processes was largely improved the potential of the light to heat conversion application in the pds activation and its oxidation mechanism are deeply elucidated from the view point of both experimental and theoretical aspects which offers the foundation and direction for the future research on the light to heat conversion application in the fenton like or other oxidation processes however the light to heat induced pds activation largely depended on the photo thermal transfer ability of the materials even though the mos2 can absorb the energy from light to transfer to heat the transfer efficiency and rate are not high enough to achieve the comparable performance of that in the heat activated pds process thus in the future study we will take effort in coupling a good catalyst with strong absorption of light to heat to produce much enhancement in the degradation of organic pollutants the light to heat induced fenton like oxidation process should be an ideal oxidation system to degrade organic contaminants for environmental remediation and solar energy application it is anticipated that this work may enable the wide development of the solar energy application to open up a novel strategy for environmental purification

useful in the generation of oh ahile et al 2020 bokare and choi 2014 among these non iron based fenton like reactions copper based fenton systems cu ii h2o2 have received significant attention in the field of water disinfection because of higher solubility of cu ii ion than fe iii species in the water at neutral ph and the natural antimicrobial property of copper fiorentino et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lee et al 2018 li et al 2020 nguyen et al 2013a nieto juarez et al 2010 peng et al 2016 initial studies on copper based fenton disinfection revealed that inactivation of microbes such as ms2 coliphage rna and dna phages sagripanti et al 1993 yamamoto 1969 by cu ii ion and h2o2 was much efficient than by cu ii ion alone nguyen et al 2013 nieto juarez et al 2010 sagripanti et al 1993 nguyen

reduction by reducing agent ha in disinfection earlier fischer et al have also demonstrated the effectiveness of reducing agent ascorbate asc in improving the e coli disinfection by cu ii and h2o2 fisher et al 2008 although chemical reducing agents improve copper based fenton disinfection they lead to additional chemical footprint and cost therefore the enhancement of copper based fenton disinfection without the chemical reducing agents is desirable it is important to note that polysaccharides and proteins present in bacterial membranes are rich in oxygen and nitrogen functional groups that bind effectively with cu ii fang et al 2009 möhl et al 1988 nakajima 2002 on the account of strong binding of cu ii ion to bacterial membrane bacteria have been proposed as an excellent bio sorbent for removal of copper from contaminated water hansda and kumar 2015 tunali et al 2006 moreover it is well known that cu ii complexes having oxygen and nitrogen dendates from amino acids and carboxylate ligands exhibit ligand to metal charge transfer lmct absorption hayase and zepp 1991 lin et al 2014 moffett and zika 1988 sýkora 1997 wu et al 2000 notably lmct photoexcitation of cu

above facts hint that under light in bacteria spiked with cu ii and h2o2 lmct photolysis of cu ii coordinated with bacterial cellular components cu ii bacteria complex may promote cu ii cu i reduction and augment the generation of reactive oxidants and inactivation photolysis of cu ii bacteria complex may enhance copper based fenton disinfection without the need for additional chemical reducing agents and organic chelates as incase of iron based fenton disinfection herein we address this knowledge gap by a systematic study on the inactivation behavior of bacteria by a copper based fenton system under photo irradiation elevated levels of copper in water could cause undesirable consequences shrivastava 2009 effective disinfection with minimal copper dosage is highly desired in

easily diffuse into cell membrane and gives a green fluorescence 500 nm on binding to dna whereas pi can enter only cells with damaged membrane and gives a red fluorescence 635 nm on binding to dna bacterial cells before and after treatment were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellet was suspended in 50 µl saline were stained with 1 1 mixture of two dyes syto 9 and pi according to manufacturer s instructions and were incubated in dark for 15 min these stained samples were fixed in a glass slide and examined at a magnification of 150 x using a nikon eclipse ti u microscope nikon japan with an excitation wavelength of 480nm syto 9 and 490 nm pi subramanian et al 2013 2 4 oh radical measurement and bsa degradation hydroxyl radicals were detected using terephthalic acid ta as a probe molecule radich and kamat 2013 in the presence of oh terephthalic acid is converted into hydroxy terephthalic acid hta a fluorescent molecule with an emission maximum at 425 nm when excited at 310 nm gonzalez et al 2018 hta shows stable strong fluorescence at 425 nm and unaffected by ph conditions 6 8 in aqueous solutions moreover it has been reported that at low concentration 250 µm cu ii has no interference in the ta assay gonzalez et al 2018 in a typical experiment the reaction mixture containing 107 cfu ml 1 of e coli cells or 2 5 μm bsa with 200 μm ta 2 mm h2o2 1 μm cu ii was irradiated for 30 min immediately after photolysis the fluorescence at 425 nm was recorded for control the reaction mixture was incubated in dark for 30 min followed by fluorescent measurement at 425 nm the concentration of bsa before and after treatment was determined by hplc hamidi and zarei 2009 further acrylamide gel electrophoresis chrambach et al 1967 was used to separate and visualize bsa protein fragments based on their molecular weight and size before and after treatment as per the reported procedure chrambach et al 1967 two independent experiments in triplicates were performed all the statistical analysis was performed using originpro 8 0 2 5 cost analysis cost estimation of fenton treatment is important for the real field application and it depends on the factors such as reagent dosage cost of reagent and electricity and water matrix constituents o dowd and pillai 2020 the median electrical energy per order eeo value of photo fenton process carried out for indigo carnine dye degradation using 6 µm fe ii and 1 125 mm h2o2 in pure water is 2 6 kwh m3 miklos et al 2018 ureña de vivanco et al 2013 eeo values for a conventional uv h2o2 process for drinking water groundwater and wastewater applications are 0 63 2 7 and 2 2 kwh m3 respectively miklos et al 2018 hence the cost estimation of visible light cu ii h2o2 system was estimated in terms of electrical energy per log inactivation ee n electricity cost and reagent cost the electrical energy ee n for n log reduction of e coli was determined using equation 1 nyangaresi et al 2018 where a is irradiated surface area cm2 fn is the light dosage required for n log reduction mj cm2 v is the volume of the sample ml c is the wall plug efficiency and wf is the water factor 1a e en a f n 3 6 10 3 v c wf wall plug efficiency of the led provided by the led supplier was 35 7 the water factor was calculated as reported earlier nyangaresi et al 2018 2a wf 1 10 α l α l ln 10 where α is the absorption coefficeient cm 1 and l is the path length of water in the cuvette the average absorbance value of 400 500 and 600 nm was considered for calculation same method was adopted to determine wf for tap water wall plug efficiency of the led provided by the led supplier was 35 7 the water factor for irradiation in wavelength range 400 nm to 700 nm 0 99 the total cost was determined using equation 2 as shown below khan et al 2014 total cost e e n x electricity cost per kwh reagent cost eq 2 electricity cost in india for industrial processes is 8 33 0 10 or 0 11 per kilowatt hour kwh the cost of h2o2 and cuso4 5h2o per kg are 1150 13 20 or 15 61 and 1314 15 08 or 17 84 respectively as per sd fine chemicals india 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of bacterial cell viability the disinfection of e coli with different cu ii and h2o2 dosage under visible light irradiation is shown in figure 1 a based on these results the optimized reagent dosage for complete disinfection of e coli 7 log cfu ml was determined to be 1 µm cu ii 0 06 mg l 2 mm h2o2 68 mg l and 195 6 j cm2 light dosage visible light 400 700 nm figure 1 a and b control experiments revealed that cu ii ion 1 µm alone or h2o2 2 mm alone either in dark or under visible light irradiation did not affect e coli cell viability 107 cfu ml fig 1b combined application of cu ii ion 1µm and h2o2 2 mm copper based fenton system in dark caused about 1 log re duction of e coli after 30 min fig 1b in agreement with earlier studies lee et al 2017 nguyen et al 2013 in contrast under visible light irradiation we observed a rapid e coli inactivation 7 log cfu ml within 20 min with a pseudo first order constant value of 0 613 0 019 min 1 fig 1b and s i fig 1 there was no regrowth of bacteria in the treated solution that was left undisturbed for 2 days both in case of pbs and stimulated tap water bacteria have internal repair mechanisms to counteract oxidative stress caused by disinfection treatments such as uvc sodis and photo fenton the repair mechanisms involves the induction of enzymes such as polymerase for dna repair and superoxide dismutase peroxidase and catalase etc to scavenge reactive oxygen species hoerter et al 2005 robertson et al 2005 valero et al studied the regrowth of bacteria after sodis sodis h2o2 and photo fenton and found photo fenton treatment to be highly effective and prevented bacteria regrowth after treatment valero et al 2017 the present results reveal that visible light cu ii h2o2 treatment caused irreversible damage to bacteria under tested conditions other bacterial strains such as s aureus gram positive bacteria p aeruginosa gram negative bacteria and also a fungus c albicans were also evaluated in dark copper based fenton system inactivated 1 log cfu ml 2 5 log cfu ml and 1 cfu ml of s aureus p aeruginosa and c albicans respectively however under visible light irradiation all these strains were completely inactivated by visible light cu ii h2o2 system within 15 20 min s i fig 2 s i table 1 similar to the case of e coli cu ii 1 µm alone or h2o2 2 mm alone either in dark or under visible light irradiation did not affect cell viability of s aureus p aeruginosa and c albicans s i fig 2 s i table 1 from these results it s evident that visible light irradiation strongly enhanced the disinfection potential of copper based fenton system 3 2 examination of bacterial membrane structure using scanning electron microscopy we examined the exposed e coli membrane surface for structural and morphological changes caused by copper based fenton treatment from the image fig 2 a it is quite clear that visible light cu ii h2o2 treatment caused distinct deformation of the cells in the form of perforations and rupture of the cellular membrane such severe membrane damage results in the leakage of internal cytoplasmic content and cell death nguyen et al 2013 subramanian et al 2013 on the other hand in the absence of visible light irradiation there was no noticeable membrane deformation by cu ii h2o2 treatment fig 2 b similar to that of control fig 2 c as mentioned earlier copper based fenton reactions 1 3 generate strong oxidants such as the oh and cupryl cu iii species tertiary butyl alcohol t buoh has very high reactivity with oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 whereas its reactivity with cu iii is negligible feng et al 2019 lee et al 2013 hence t buoh was used to distinguish the role of oh and cu iii in copper based fenton disinfection lee et al 2013 nguyen et al 2013 upon addition of oh radical scavenger t buoh the inactivation efficiency of the visible light cu ii h2o2 system was reduced from 7 to 4 log units of e coli cells in 20 min indicating the bactericidal potential of oh s i fig 3 the remaining inactivation even in presence of excess t buoh reveal that other oxidants such as o2 and cu iii generated reactions 1 3 are responsible for oxidative damage of bacteria as reported earlier nguyen et al 2013 cu iii is an important oxidant in copper based fenton reactions because of the relatively higher redox potential of cu iii cu ii 1 7 2 3 v than o2 0 28 v the diminished inhibitory effect of t buoh in visible light cu ii h2o2 system s i fig 3 reveals the prominent bactericidal role of cu iii species earlier lee et al showed that the degradation of reactive black 5 rb5 by cu ii 0 1 mm and h2o2 10 mm was decreased from 90 to 65 upon the addition of t buoh 100 mm to reveal the role of cu iii species in copper based fenton system lee et al 2013 the bacterial viability measured as colony forming units per ml cfu ml using the standard spread plate relies on the assumption that only viable cells can form colonies however bacteria can also exist in other latent states davey 2011 therefore apart from viability measurements in cfu ml the extent of oxidative stress induced bacterial damage was examined using live dead assay the live dead assay using confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed the loss of membrane integrity and cell viability as discussed below fluorescent images of e coli treated with visible light cu ii h2o2 cu ii h2o2 and control no treatment are shown in figure 2 d e and f respectively it is important to note that the nucleic acid stain syto 9 penetrate viable bacterial cell membranes and gives a green fluorescent image whereas propidium iodide can only penetrate damaged membranes and gives a red fluorescent image subramanian et al 2013 for e coli treated with visible light cu ii h2o2 only red cells were observed indicating all cells are dead fig 2 d on the contrary no red cells were detected for cu ii h2o2 treatment fig 2 e indicating negligible cell death similar to that of control fig 2 f similar results were also observed for gram positive bacteria s aureus s i fig 4 whose cell membrane architecture is quite different from gram negative bacteria e coli live dead assay has been used to examine cell membrane integrity after oxidative treatment lee et al 2017 palmroth et al 2006 the live dead assay revealed the complete loss of cell viability within 20 min fig 2d and further support the absence of regrowth even after 48 hours as discussed above giannakis et al used 5 carboxyfluorescein diacetate cfda and propidium iodide pi for flow cytometry analysis to assess the cell damage by photo fenton treatment the study showed that viability was lost within 30 min of treatment giannakis et al 2016b recently fiorentino et al assessed the bacterial abundance and size distribution after photo treatments uv c h2o2 cu ids uv c h2o2 cu uv c h2o2 fe h2o2 and uv c by flow cytometry using a nucleic acid stain sybr green 1 this report revealed that photo fenton treatments are more effective than the conventional disinfection process such as uvc and h2o2 fiorentino et al 2018 analysis of sem and fluorescence microscopic images unambiguously revealed that the severity of structural disruption of e coli cells by cu ii h2o2 system is significantly higher under visible light irradiation compared to dark this stark difference in the bacterial damage between visible light cu ii h2o2 and cu ii h2o2 systems indicated that the oxidants generated without visible light irradiation were not sufficient for complete inactivation 1 log cfu ml in 30 min whereas oxidants generated under visible light irradiation were adequate for a complete 7 log cfu ml inactivation within 20 min 3 3 bsa degradation and oh assay fe iii bacteria complexes with lmct character were reported to be formed in the water matrix that was spiked with fe iii and bacteria spuhler et al 2010 lmct photolysis of fe iii bacteria complexes caused the direct oxidation of the biomolecules on the cell membrane and other organelles as well as regenerated fe ii giannakis et al 2016a giannakis et al 2016b giannakis et al 2018 spuhler et al 2010 hence the lmct mechanism mediated fe iii bacteria complex was proposed for the enhancement of fenton disinfection under solar light based on the excellent binding between cu ii and bacteria we propose an analogous lmct mechanism involving cu ii bacteria complexes for the enhanced disinfection in visible light cu ii h2o2 than the cu ii h2o2 to elucidate this mechanism we performed the following experiments first bovine serum albumin bsa was used as a model target biomolecule for degradation by visible light cu ii h2o2 system in comparision with cu ii h2o2 kocha et al 1997 bsa was chosen because it has an amino terminal copper and nickel atcun binding motif harford and sarkar 1997 and known to bind cu ii with oxygen and nitrogen dentate that exhibit lmct absorption s i fig 5 both hplc fig 3 a and sds page analysis s i fig 6 revealed that visible light cu ii h2o2 system caused almost complete degradation of bsa on the other hand only partial degradation of bsa was observed in cu ii h2o2 in agreement with an earlier report kocha et al 1997 in another experiment using oh probe terephthalic acid we compared the oh generated in visible light cu ii h2o2 and cu ii h2o2 in the presence of e coli and bsa as target substrates fig 3 b and c radich and kamat 2013 fluorescence intensity measurement analysis revealed that oh generated in cu ii h2o2 was significantly lower about 35 compared to that generated in visible light cu ii h2o2 in case of e coli as well as in bsa oh radical was not generated by ta in the presence of cu ii alone or h2o2 alone both under light and dark conditions together the above experiments support a visible light induced lmct mediated mechanism that enhanced copper based fenton reactions and intensified bacterial inactivation moreover oxidized biomolecular ligands generated in the lmct photolysis can further produce ros such as o2 oh h2o2 in the presence of oxygen and contribute to the oxidative stress in photo fenton based disinfection bichai et al 2012 nahim granados et al 2018 spuhler et al 2010 it is known that bacteria are an excellent adsorbent of cu ii hansda and kumar 2015b kulczycki et al 2002 the effective binding of cu ii to oxygen and nitrogen dendates of bacterial biomolecules leads to cu ii localization as cu ii bacteria lmct centers a higher amount of hydroxylated product hta generated in visible light cu ii h2o2 system compared to dark cu ii h2o2 fig 3b indicates the photoreduction of cu ii bacterial centers by lmct photolysis to generate highly reactive oxidants oh and cu iii reaction 2 and 3 importantly the lmct photoreduction of cu ii bacteria complex occurs in the close proximity of cell causing severe cell damage as shown in sem and fluorescence images even with addition of trace amount of cu ii fig 2 thus based on all the above results we propose that the enhanced disinfection in visible light cu ii h2o2 than the dark cu ii h2o2 is due to the lmct mechanism involving cu ii bacteria complexes analogous that reported in iron based fenton disinfection in another study an organic ligand such as ids fiorentino et al 2018 bound to cu ii was used as a photo fenton like catalyst for disinfection table 1 however cu ii h2o2 ids under uvc light showed very little enhancement 3 5 log cfu ml units in 10 min compared to cu ii h2o2 under uvc light 3 5 log cfu ml units in 15 min table 1 moreover earlier studies have demonstrated the improvement of copper based disinfection by the addition of a chemical reagent such as ha lee et al 2017 for example the addition of 0 1 mm ha to the cu ii h2o2 system 5 µm of cu ii and 0 1 mm h2o2 reduced the time required for p aeruginosa inactivation 5 log cfu ml from 30 min to 5 min table 1 however the visible light irradiation 195 6 j cm2 of e coli suspension in the presence of 1 µm cu ii and 2 mm of h2o2 itself caused 7 log reduction of cell viability in 20 min whereas in dark only 1 log reduction was observed fig 1 and table 1 thus the present study demonstrates visible light enhanced copper based fenton disinfection is an effective alternate to chemical methods that used reducing agents or organic ligands moreover visible light cu ii h2o2 system require lowest copper dosage 1 µm compared to previously reported treatment conditions table 1 3 4 cost assessment as per the optimized conditions 1 µm cu ii 2 mm h2o2 195 6 j cm2 the electrical energy efficiency e e n nyangaresi et al 2018 reagent cost and electricity cost khan et al 2014 to disinfect 1000 l m3 of bacteria contaminated water by visible light cu ii h2o2 system were determined to be 32 64 kwh m3 78 62 1 06 or 0 90 and 271 89 3 68 or 3 11 respectively the estimated total cost to treat 1000 liters m3 of contaminated water using the visible light cu ii h2o2 system was determined to be about 350 4 73 or 4 01 which is fairly affordable in india importantly the present visible light cu ii h2o2 disinfection does not require additional reducing agents and organic ligands to make a photo fenton catalyst and therefore advantageous in the reduction of operational cost and the chemical footprint of disinfection treatment to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that proves the utility of visible light irradiation and lmct character of cu ii bacteria complex to enhance copper based fenton disinfection for real field applications of copper based fenton disinfection the amount of copper used for the treatment should be well within the permissible limits set by regulatory bodies for disposal the permissible limit set for copper for disposal in to surface water by major regulatory bodies are eu 2 mg l 31 4 μm us epa 1 3 mg l 20 45 µm who 2 mg l 31 4 μm and central pollution control board india 1 5 mg l 23 6 µm kumar and puri 2012 the copper dosage for bacterial inactivation in the present work is as low as 0 06 mg l 1 µm which is about 20 times lower than the permissible limit recommended by the regulatory bodies 3 5 disinfection in groundwater and sunlight irradiation the disinfection experiments were carried out in a sterile simulated groundwater prepared by spiking commonly occurring inorganic ions in natural water such as co3 2 300 mg l 1 cl 250 mg l 1 so4 2 200 mg l 1 no3 45 mg l 1 and natural organic matter humic acid 1 mg l 1 subramanian et al 2013 ions and nom have been shown to retard fenton disinfection by scavenging the ros rommozzi et al 2020 even in the presence of a variety of ions and nom in simulated groundwater the present visible light cu ii h2o2 caused complete e coli inactivation within 25 min fig 4 indicating the feasibility of the copper based fenton system for groundwater disinfection whereas cu ii h2o2 showed poor disinfection moreover there was no bacterial regrowth after 1 and 2 days indicating the complete inactivation of bacteria in tap water under tested conditions the estimated total cost to treat 1000 liters m3 of contaminated tap water using the visible light cu ii h2o2 system was determined to be about 467 5 34 or 6 32 given the intense interest in solar energy driven water treatment processes bichai et al 2012 mcguigan et al 2012 nahim granados et al 2018 and the encouraging results of visible light cu ii h2o2 system as discussed above we explored the feasibility of natural sunlight to promote cu ii h2o2 system disinfection of potable water source such as groundwater sunlight cu ii h2o2 caused 3 times more 7 log cfu ml inactivation than sunlight h2o2 2 3 log cfu ml fig 5 sunlight h2o2 has been reported to disinfect bacteria bichai et al 2012 nahim granados et al 2018 spuhler et al 2010 however the present results reveal that sunlight cu ii h2o2 shows higher disinfection efficiency than sunlight h2o2 fig 5 cu ii 1 µm alone either in dark or under sunlight and h2o2 2mm in dark did not affect e coli cell viability and cu ii h2o2 in dark caused only 1 log reduction of e coli after 30 min fig 5 moreover by using natural sunlight that is available free of cost the total treatment cost to treat 1 m3 of contaminated water by the sunlight cu ii h2o2 system was determined to be 80 1 or 0 8 which is 4 times cheaper than visible light led cu ii h2o2 350 or 4 7 or 4 such a low cost treatment is well suited for water disinfection in rural regions of india the results reveal the scope of sunlight cu ii h2o2 as prospective solar energy driven aop for water disinfection in low budget scenarios 4 conclusions visible light cu ii h2o2 caused effective disinfection compared to the dark cu ii h2o2 system disinfection by visible light cu ii h2o2 has significant features such as a very low copper dosage that comply the permissible limits set by regulatory bodies and the needlessness of chemical reducing agents and organic ligands leds as irradiation source have several advantages such as long life small dimension to save space and less energy consumption electrical energy efficiency e e 1 for a log reduction of e coli and total treatment cost of visible light cu ii h2o2 were determined to be 32 64 kwh m3 and 350 m3 or 3 5 m3 respectively that is economical and affordable in many developing countries moreover cu ii h2o2 disinfection was also enhanced by sunlight similar to visible light cu ii h2o2 system combined visible light cu ii h2o2 and sunlight cu ii h2o2 disinfection systems are energy saving and useful for continuous supply of treatement water throughout day and night the findings provide strong evidence for the beneficial impact of photo irradiation under

17272,copper based fenton disinfection system cu ii h2o2 is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop previous works have used reducing agents and organic ligands to improve the disinfection efficiency of cu ii h2o2 system here we report visible light cu ii h2o2 system showed enhanced disinfection compared to cu ii h2o2 system without the need of reducing chemical agent or organic ligand energy efficient led array was used as a visible light source in the visible light cu ii h2o2 system under the optimized condition pseudo first order inactivation rate constant kobs of e coli by visible light cu ii h2o2 0 613 0 005 min 1 was about 8 times greater than cu ii h2o2 0 08 0 011 min 1 scanning electron microscopy and baclight live dead assay proved enhanced cell membrane damage by visible light cu ii h2o2 in comparison with cu ii h2o2 based on the bovine serum albumin bsa degradation and oh radical measurement by visible light cu ii h2o2 a ligand to metal charge transfer lmct mechanism by cu ii bacterial complex is proposed for enhanced disinfection electrical energy efficiency e e 1 for a log reduction of e coli and the total treatment cost of visible light cu ii h2o2 was determined to be 32 64 kwh m3 and 350 m3 3 9 m3 or 4 74 m3 respectively indicating its cost effectiveness disinfection efficiency by sunlight cu ii h2o2 system solar irradiance 746 138 w m2 was almost comparable to led based visible light cu ii h2o2 system with total treatment cost estimated to be 80 m3 0 9 m3 or 1 1 m3 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection led fenton bacteria advanced oxidation processes 1 introduction bacterial contamination in water supplies is a major global problem although routine disinfection treatments like chlorination are effective the raising concern of carcinogenic chlorinated disinfection byproducts calls for safer alternatives diana et al 2019 disinfection using semiconductor photocatalysts is another approach gong et al 2019 nevertheless photocatalytic materials based disinfection have challenges such as metal ion leaching recovery and regeneration in the recent years advanced oxidation processes aops especially fenton based processes have shown promising solutions to alleviate bacterial contamination in water sources gassie and englehardt 2017 miklos et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2019 hydrogen peroxide is the safest oxidant for environmental applications under the category oxidants and oxidant stabilizers as per the usepa list of the safer chemical ingredients list scil si note 1 although fenton based processes are optimal at acidic ph studies have shown successful disinfection at neutral ph by the use of fe iii organic ligands ahile et al 2020 garcía fernández et al 2019 giannakis et al 2016 spuhler et al 2010 zhang and zhou 2019 the addition of chelating ligands helped to improve fe iii dissolution and to promote ligand to metal charge transfer lmct reduction of fe iii to fe ii towards further activation of h2o2 and generation of hydroxyl radical oh ahile et al 2020 zhang and zhou 2019 nevertheless the chelate promoted near neutral fenton based disinfection process contributes to the chemical footprint and additional cost ahile et al 2020 on the other hand non iron based fenton like reactions using cerium manganese copper cobalt ruthenium and chromium have also been shown to be useful in the generation of oh ahile et al 2020 bokare and choi 2014 among these non iron based fenton like reactions copper based fenton systems cu ii h2o2 have received significant attention in the field of water disinfection because of higher solubility of cu ii ion than fe iii species in the water at neutral ph and the natural antimicrobial property of copper fiorentino et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lee et al 2018 li et al 2020 nguyen et al 2013a nieto juarez et al 2010 peng et al 2016 initial studies on copper based fenton disinfection revealed that inactivation of microbes such as ms2 coliphage rna and dna phages sagripanti et al 1993 yamamoto 1969 by cu ii ion and h2o2 was much efficient than by cu ii ion alone nguyen et al 2013 nieto juarez et al 2010 sagripanti et al 1993 nguyen et al showed oxidative stress induced inactivation of e coli and ms2 phage by cu ii h2o2 system via in situ generation of strong oxidants such as the oh and cupryl species cu iii through reactions 1 3 nguyen et al 2013 1 cu ii h 2 o 2 cu i o 2 2 h 2 cu i h 2 o 2 cu ii oh oh 3 cu i h 2 o 2 2 h cu iii h 2 o it is important to note that reaction 1 k 4 6 102 m 1 s 1 is two orders of magnitude slower than reaction 2 k 1 0 104 m 1 s 1 reaction 2 is a fenton like reaction wherein cu i activate h2o2 to produce reactive oh kim et al 2015 nguyen et al 2013 park et al 2012 pham et al 2013 hence the reduction of cu ii to cu i by suitable reducing agents is expected to enhance the in situ generation of reactive oxidants recently lee et al showed marked enhancement 5 log cfu ml in 5 min in the inactivation of planktonic p aeruginosa by cu ii h2o2 hydroxylamine ha system when compared to cu ii h2o2 system 1 7 log cfu ml in 5 min lee et al 2017 indicating the significant role of cu ii cu i reduction by reducing agent ha in disinfection earlier fischer et al have also demonstrated the effectiveness of reducing agent ascorbate asc in improving the e coli disinfection by cu ii and h2o2 fisher et al 2008 although chemical reducing agents improve copper based fenton disinfection they lead to additional chemical footprint and cost therefore the enhancement of copper based fenton disinfection without the chemical reducing agents is desirable it is important to note that polysaccharides and proteins present in bacterial membranes are rich in oxygen and nitrogen functional groups that bind effectively with cu ii fang et al 2009 möhl et al 1988 nakajima 2002 on the account of strong binding of cu ii ion to bacterial membrane bacteria have been proposed as an excellent bio sorbent for removal of copper from contaminated water hansda and kumar 2015 tunali et al 2006 moreover it is well known that cu ii complexes having oxygen and nitrogen dendates from amino acids and carboxylate ligands exhibit ligand to metal charge transfer lmct absorption hayase and zepp 1991 lin et al 2014 moffett and zika 1988 sýkora 1997 wu et al 2000 notably lmct photoexcitation of cu ii complexes with oxygen and nitrogen dentates reduce cu ii to cu i with concomitant oxidation of the ligand hayase and zepp 1991 lin et al 2014 moffett and zika 1988 sýkora 1997 wu et al 2000 the above facts hint that under light in bacteria spiked with cu ii and h2o2 lmct photolysis of cu ii coordinated with bacterial cellular components cu ii bacteria complex may promote cu ii cu i reduction and augment the generation of reactive oxidants and inactivation photolysis of cu ii bacteria complex may enhance copper based fenton disinfection without the need for additional chemical reducing agents and organic chelates as incase of iron based fenton disinfection herein we address this knowledge gap by a systematic study on the inactivation behavior of bacteria by a copper based fenton system under photo irradiation elevated levels of copper in water could cause undesirable consequences shrivastava 2009 effective disinfection with minimal copper dosage is highly desired in homogeneous copper based fenton process therefore in the present study the disinfection by visible cu ii h2o2 and dark cu ii h2o2 was compared using minimum amount of cu ii within the permissible limit set by regulatory bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals copper ii chloride pentahydrate hydrogen peroxide 30 tertiary butyl alcohol t buoh humic acid sodium terephthalate c8h4na2o4

power meter the light dosage in j cm 2 was determined by multiplying the irradiance in w cm 2 with time in seconds for photo antimicrobial assays the reaction mixture contained 107 cfu ml 1 of

studied in simulated tap water subramanian et al 2013 that contained a defined composition of inorganic and organic matter composition of simulated tap water is co3 2 300 mg l 1 cl 250 mg l 1 so4 2 200 mg l 1 no3 45 mg l 1 natural organic matter humic acid 1 mg l 1 subramanian et al 2013 for solar photolysis the samples were irradiated in pyrex test tubes secured with cotton plugs and exposed to sunlight from 12 00 to 1 00 pm these experiments were repeated for 10 days and the mean value was considered to plot the graph 2 3 examination of cell membrane the e coli cell membrane surface and morphology of e coli before and after treatment was examined using scanning electron microscopy e coli cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 15 min after discarding the supernatant the obtained cell pellet was suspended in 100 µl of pbs and fixed with 2 glutaraldehyde solution for 1 h cells were then washed thrice with pbs gradually dehydrated using graded ethanol h2o mixture of 10 25 50 75 90 v v and finally with 100 ethanol followed by air drying dried cells were then coated with platinum by jeol jfc 1600 autobine sputter and images were taken with a jeol jsm 6360 lv scanning electron microscope at a voltage of around 10 kv subramanian et al 2013 the integrity of e coli cell membrane was examined using invitrogen molecular probes live dead baclight bacterial viability kit l7012 according to the manufacturer this assay is based on the competitive binding of two different fluorescent nucleic acid stains syto 9 and propidium iodide pi syto 9 can easily diffuse into cell membrane and gives a green fluorescence 500 nm on binding to dna whereas pi can enter only cells with damaged membrane and gives a red fluorescence 635 nm on binding to dna bacterial cells before and after treatment were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellet was suspended in 50 µl saline were stained with 1 1 mixture of two dyes syto 9 and pi according to manufacturer s instructions and were incubated in dark for 15 min these stained samples were fixed in a glass slide and examined at a magnification of 150 x using a nikon eclipse ti u microscope nikon japan with an excitation wavelength of 480nm syto 9 and 490 nm pi subramanian et al 2013 2 4 oh radical measurement and bsa degradation hydroxyl radicals were detected using terephthalic acid ta as a probe molecule radich and kamat 2013 in the presence of oh terephthalic acid is converted into hydroxy terephthalic acid hta a fluorescent molecule with an emission maximum at 425 nm when excited at 310 nm gonzalez et al 2018 hta shows stable strong fluorescence at 425 nm and unaffected by ph conditions 6 8 in aqueous solutions moreover it has been reported that at low concentration 250 µm cu ii has no interference in the ta assay gonzalez et al 2018 in a typical experiment the reaction mixture containing 107 cfu ml 1 of e coli cells or 2 5 μm bsa with 200 μm ta 2 mm h2o2 1 μm cu ii was irradiated for 30 min immediately after photolysis the fluorescence at 425 nm was recorded for control the reaction mixture was incubated in dark for 30 min followed by fluorescent measurement at 425 nm the concentration of bsa before and after treatment was determined by hplc hamidi and zarei 2009 further acrylamide gel electrophoresis chrambach et al 1967 was used to separate and visualize bsa protein fragments based on their molecular weight and size before and after treatment as per the reported procedure chrambach et al 1967 two independent experiments in triplicates were performed all the statistical analysis was performed using originpro 8 0 2 5 cost analysis cost estimation of fenton treatment is important for the real field application and it depends on the factors such as reagent dosage cost of reagent and electricity and water matrix constituents o dowd and pillai 2020 the median electrical energy per order eeo value of photo fenton process carried out for indigo carnine dye degradation using 6 µm fe ii and 1 125 mm h2o2 in pure water is 2 6 kwh m3 miklos et al 2018 ureña de vivanco et al 2013 eeo values for a conventional uv h2o2 process for drinking water groundwater and wastewater applications are 0 63 2 7 and 2 2 kwh m3 respectively miklos et al 2018 hence the cost estimation of visible light cu ii h2o2 system was estimated in terms of electrical energy per log inactivation ee n electricity cost and reagent cost the electrical energy ee n for n log reduction of e coli was determined using equation 1 nyangaresi et al 2018 where a is irradiated surface area cm2 fn is the light dosage required for n log reduction mj cm2 v is the volume of the sample ml c is the wall plug efficiency and wf is the water factor 1a e en a f n 3 6 10 3 v c wf wall plug efficiency of the led provided by the led supplier was 35 7 the water factor was calculated as reported earlier nyangaresi et al 2018 2a wf 1 10 α l α l ln 10 where α is the absorption coefficeient cm 1 and l is the path length of water in the cuvette the average absorbance value of 400 500 and 600 nm was considered for calculation same method was adopted to determine wf for tap water wall plug efficiency of the led provided by the led supplier was 35 7 the water factor for irradiation in wavelength range 400 nm to 700 nm 0 99 the total cost was determined using equation 2 as shown below khan et al 2014 total cost e e n x electricity cost per kwh reagent cost eq 2 electricity cost in india for industrial processes is 8 33 0 10 or 0 11 per kilowatt hour kwh the cost of h2o2 and cuso4 5h2o per kg are 1150 13 20 or 15 61 and 1314 15 08 or 17 84 respectively as per sd fine chemicals india 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of bacterial cell viability the disinfection of e coli with different cu ii and h2o2 dosage under visible light irradiation is shown in figure 1 a based on these results the optimized reagent dosage for complete disinfection of e coli 7 log cfu ml was determined to be 1 µm cu ii 0 06 mg l 2 mm h2o2 68 mg l and 195 6 j cm2 light dosage visible light 400 700 nm figure 1 a and b control experiments revealed that cu ii ion 1 µm alone or h2o2 2 mm alone either in dark or under visible light irradiation did not affect e coli cell viability 107 cfu ml fig 1b combined application of cu ii ion 1µm and h2o2 2 mm copper based fenton system in dark caused about 1 log re duction of e coli after 30 min fig 1b in agreement with earlier studies lee et al 2017 nguyen et al 2013 in contrast under visible light irradiation we observed a rapid e coli inactivation 7 log cfu ml within 20 min with a pseudo first order constant value of 0 613 0 019 min 1 fig 1b and s i fig 1 there was no regrowth of bacteria in the treated solution that was left undisturbed for 2 days both in case of pbs and stimulated tap water bacteria have internal repair mechanisms to counteract oxidative stress caused by disinfection treatments such as uvc sodis and photo fenton the repair mechanisms involves the induction of enzymes such as polymerase for dna repair and superoxide dismutase peroxidase and catalase etc to scavenge reactive oxygen species hoerter et al 2005 robertson et al 2005 valero et al studied the regrowth of bacteria after sodis sodis h2o2 and photo fenton and found photo fenton treatment to be highly effective and prevented bacteria regrowth after treatment valero et al 2017 the present results reveal that visible light cu ii h2o2 treatment caused irreversible damage to bacteria under tested conditions other bacterial strains such as s aureus gram positive bacteria p aeruginosa gram negative bacteria and also a fungus c albicans were also evaluated in dark copper based fenton system inactivated 1 log cfu ml 2 5 log cfu ml and 1 cfu ml of s aureus p aeruginosa and c albicans respectively however under visible light irradiation all these strains were completely inactivated by visible light cu ii h2o2 system within 15 20 min s i fig 2 s i table 1 similar to the case of e coli cu ii 1 µm alone or h2o2 2 mm alone either in dark or under visible light irradiation did not affect cell viability of s aureus p aeruginosa and c albicans s i fig 2 s i table 1 from these results it s evident that visible light irradiation strongly enhanced the disinfection potential of copper based fenton system 3 2 examination of bacterial membrane structure using scanning electron microscopy we examined the exposed e coli membrane surface for structural and morphological changes caused by copper based fenton treatment from the image fig 2 a it is quite clear that visible light cu ii h2o2 treatment caused distinct deformation of the cells in the form of perforations and rupture of the cellular membrane such severe membrane damage results in the leakage of internal cytoplasmic content and cell death nguyen et al 2013 subramanian et al 2013 on the other hand in the absence of visible light irradiation there was no noticeable membrane deformation by cu ii h2o2 treatment fig 2 b similar to that of control fig 2 c as mentioned earlier copper based fenton reactions 1 3 generate strong oxidants such as the oh and cupryl cu iii species tertiary butyl alcohol t buoh has very high reactivity with oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 whereas its reactivity with cu iii is negligible feng et al 2019 lee et al 2013 hence t buoh was used to distinguish the role of oh and cu iii in copper based fenton disinfection lee et al 2013 nguyen et al 2013 upon addition of oh radical scavenger t buoh the inactivation efficiency of the visible light cu ii h2o2 system was reduced from 7 to 4 log units of e coli cells in 20 min indicating the bactericidal potential of oh s i fig 3 the remaining inactivation even in presence of excess t buoh reveal that other oxidants such as o2 and cu iii generated reactions 1 3 are responsible for oxidative damage of bacteria as reported earlier nguyen et al 2013 cu iii is an important oxidant in copper based fenton reactions because of the relatively higher redox potential of cu iii cu ii 1 7 2 3 v than o2 0 28 v the diminished inhibitory effect of t buoh in visible light cu ii h2o2 system s i fig 3 reveals the prominent bactericidal role of cu iii species earlier lee et al showed that the degradation of reactive black 5 rb5 by cu ii 0 1 mm and h2o2 10 mm was decreased from 90 to 65 upon the addition of t buoh 100 mm to reveal the role of cu iii species in copper based fenton system lee et al 2013 the bacterial viability measured as colony forming units per ml cfu ml using the standard spread plate relies on the assumption that only viable cells can form colonies however bacteria can also exist in other latent states davey 2011 therefore apart from viability measurements in cfu ml the extent of oxidative stress induced bacterial damage was examined using live dead assay the live dead assay using confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed the loss of membrane integrity and cell viability as discussed below fluorescent images of e coli treated with visible light cu ii h2o2 cu ii h2o2 and control no treatment are shown in figure 2 d e and f respectively it is important to note that the nucleic acid stain syto 9 penetrate viable bacterial cell membranes and gives a green fluorescent image whereas propidium iodide can only penetrate damaged membranes and gives a red fluorescent image subramanian et al 2013 for e coli treated with visible light cu ii h2o2 only red cells were observed indicating all cells are dead fig 2 d on the contrary no red cells were detected for cu ii h2o2 treatment fig 2 e indicating negligible cell death similar to that of control fig 2 f similar results were also observed for gram positive bacteria s aureus s i fig 4 whose cell membrane architecture is quite different from gram negative bacteria e coli live dead assay has been used to examine cell membrane integrity after oxidative treatment lee et al 2017 palmroth et al 2006 the live dead assay revealed the complete loss of cell viability within 20 min fig 2d and further support the absence of regrowth even after 48 hours as discussed above giannakis et al used 5 carboxyfluorescein diacetate cfda and propidium iodide pi for flow cytometry analysis to assess the cell damage by photo fenton treatment the study showed that viability was lost within 30 min of treatment giannakis et al 2016b recently fiorentino et al assessed the bacterial abundance and size distribution after photo treatments uv c h2o2 cu ids uv c h2o2 cu uv c h2o2 fe h2o2 and uv c by flow cytometry using a nucleic acid stain sybr green 1 this report revealed that photo fenton treatments are more effective than the conventional disinfection process such as uvc and h2o2 fiorentino et al 2018 analysis of sem and fluorescence microscopic images unambiguously revealed that the severity of structural disruption of e coli cells by cu ii h2o2 system is significantly higher under visible light irradiation compared to dark this stark difference in the bacterial damage between visible light cu ii h2o2 and cu ii h2o2 systems indicated that the oxidants generated without visible light irradiation were not sufficient for complete inactivation 1 log cfu ml in 30 min whereas oxidants generated under visible light irradiation were adequate for a complete 7 log cfu ml inactivation within 20 min 3 3 bsa degradation and oh assay fe iii bacteria complexes with lmct character were reported to be formed in the water matrix that was spiked with fe iii and bacteria spuhler et al 2010 lmct photolysis of fe iii bacteria complexes caused the direct oxidation of the biomolecules on the cell membrane and other organelles as well as regenerated fe ii giannakis et al 2016a giannakis et al 2016b giannakis et al 2018 spuhler et al 2010 hence the lmct mechanism mediated fe iii bacteria complex was proposed for the enhancement of fenton disinfection under solar light based on the excellent binding between cu ii and bacteria we propose an analogous lmct mechanism involving cu ii bacteria complexes for the enhanced disinfection in visible light cu ii h2o2 than the cu ii h2o2 to elucidate this mechanism we performed the following experiments first bovine serum albumin bsa was used as a model target biomolecule for degradation by visible light cu ii h2o2 system in comparision with cu ii h2o2 kocha et al 1997 bsa was chosen because it has an amino terminal copper and nickel atcun binding motif harford and sarkar 1997 and known to bind cu ii with oxygen and nitrogen dentate that exhibit lmct absorption s i fig 5 both hplc fig 3 a and sds page analysis s i fig 6 revealed that visible light cu ii h2o2 system caused almost complete degradation of bsa on the other hand only partial degradation of bsa was observed in cu ii h2o2 in agreement with an earlier report kocha et al 1997 in another experiment using oh probe terephthalic acid we compared the oh generated in visible light cu ii h2o2 and cu ii h2o2 in the presence of e coli and bsa as target substrates fig 3 b and c radich and kamat 2013 fluorescence intensity measurement analysis revealed that oh generated in cu ii h2o2 was significantly lower about 35 compared to that generated in visible light cu ii h2o2 in case of e coli as well as in bsa oh radical was not generated by ta in the presence of cu ii alone or h2o2 alone both under light and dark conditions together the above experiments support a visible light induced lmct mediated mechanism that enhanced copper based fenton reactions and intensified bacterial inactivation moreover oxidized biomolecular ligands generated in the lmct photolysis can further produce ros such as o2 oh h2o2 in the presence of oxygen and contribute to the oxidative stress in photo fenton based disinfection bichai et al 2012 nahim granados et al 2018 spuhler et al 2010 it is known that bacteria are an excellent adsorbent of cu ii hansda and kumar 2015b kulczycki et al 2002 the effective binding of cu ii to oxygen and nitrogen dendates of bacterial biomolecules leads to cu ii localization as cu ii bacteria lmct centers a higher amount of hydroxylated product hta generated in visible light cu ii h2o2 system compared to dark cu ii h2o2 fig 3b indicates the photoreduction of cu ii bacterial centers by lmct photolysis to generate highly reactive oxidants oh and cu iii reaction 2 and 3 importantly the lmct photoreduction of cu ii bacteria complex occurs in the close proximity of cell causing severe cell damage as shown in sem and fluorescence images even with addition of trace amount of cu ii fig 2 thus based on all the above results we propose that the enhanced disinfection in visible light cu ii h2o2 than the dark cu ii h2o2 is due to the lmct mechanism involving cu ii bacteria complexes analogous that reported in iron based fenton disinfection in another study an organic ligand such as ids fiorentino et al 2018 bound to cu ii was used as a photo fenton like catalyst for disinfection table 1 however cu ii h2o2 ids under uvc light showed very little enhancement 3 5 log cfu ml units in 10 min compared to cu ii h2o2 under uvc light 3 5 log cfu ml units in 15 min table 1 moreover earlier studies have demonstrated the improvement of copper based disinfection by the addition of a chemical reagent such as ha lee et al 2017 for example the addition of 0 1 mm ha to the cu ii h2o2 system 5 µm of cu ii and 0 1 mm h2o2 reduced the time required for p aeruginosa inactivation 5 log cfu ml from 30 min to 5 min table 1 however the visible light irradiation 195 6 j cm2 of e coli suspension in the presence of 1 µm cu ii and 2 mm of h2o2 itself caused 7 log reduction of cell viability in 20 min whereas in dark only 1 log reduction was observed fig 1 and table 1 thus the present study demonstrates visible light enhanced copper based fenton disinfection is an effective alternate to chemical methods that used reducing agents or organic ligands moreover visible light cu ii h2o2 system require lowest copper dosage 1 µm compared to previously reported treatment conditions table 1 3 4 cost assessment as per the optimized conditions 1 µm cu ii 2 mm h2o2 195 6 j cm2 the electrical energy efficiency e e n nyangaresi et al 2018 reagent cost and electricity cost khan et al 2014 to disinfect 1000 l m3 of bacteria contaminated water by visible light cu ii h2o2 system were determined to be 32 64 kwh m3 78 62 1 06 or 0 90 and 271 89 3 68 or 3 11 respectively the estimated total cost to treat 1000 liters m3 of contaminated water using the visible light cu ii h2o2 system was determined to be about 350 4 73 or 4 01 which is fairly affordable in india importantly the present visible light cu ii h2o2 disinfection does not require additional reducing agents and organic ligands to make a photo fenton catalyst and therefore advantageous in the reduction of operational cost and the chemical footprint of disinfection treatment to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that proves the utility of visible light irradiation and lmct character of cu ii bacteria complex to enhance copper based fenton disinfection for real field applications of copper based fenton disinfection the amount of copper used for the treatment should be well within the permissible limits set by regulatory bodies for disposal the permissible limit set for copper for disposal in to surface water by major regulatory bodies are eu 2 mg l 31 4 μm us epa 1 3 mg l 20 45 µm who 2 mg l 31 4 μm and central pollution control board india 1 5 mg l 23 6 µm kumar and puri 2012 the copper dosage for bacterial inactivation in the present work is as low as 0 06 mg l 1 µm which is about 20 times lower than the permissible limit recommended by the regulatory bodies 3 5 disinfection in groundwater and sunlight irradiation the disinfection experiments were carried out in a sterile simulated groundwater prepared by spiking commonly occurring inorganic ions in natural water such as co3 2 300 mg l 1 cl 250 mg l 1 so4 2 200 mg l 1 no3 45 mg l 1 and natural organic matter humic acid 1 mg l 1 subramanian et al 2013 ions and nom have been shown to retard fenton disinfection by scavenging the ros rommozzi et al 2020 even in the presence of a variety of ions and nom in simulated groundwater the present visible light cu ii h2o2 caused complete e coli inactivation within 25 min fig 4 indicating the feasibility of the copper based fenton system for groundwater disinfection whereas cu ii h2o2 showed poor disinfection moreover there was no bacterial regrowth after 1 and 2 days indicating the complete inactivation of bacteria in tap water under tested conditions the estimated total cost to treat 1000 liters m3 of contaminated tap water using the visible light cu ii h2o2 system was determined to be about 467 5 34 or 6 32 given the intense interest in solar energy driven water treatment processes bichai et al 2012 mcguigan et al 2012 nahim granados et al 2018 and the encouraging results of visible light cu ii h2o2 system as discussed above we explored the feasibility of natural sunlight to promote cu ii h2o2 system disinfection of potable water source such as groundwater sunlight cu ii h2o2 caused 3 times more 7 log cfu ml inactivation than sunlight h2o2 2 3 log cfu ml fig 5 sunlight h2o2 has been reported to disinfect bacteria bichai et al 2012 nahim granados et al 2018 spuhler et al 2010 however the present results reveal that sunlight cu ii h2o2 shows higher disinfection efficiency than sunlight h2o2 fig 5 cu ii 1 µm alone either in dark or under sunlight and h2o2 2mm in dark did not affect e coli cell viability and cu ii h2o2 in dark caused only 1 log reduction of e coli after 30 min fig 5 moreover by using natural sunlight that is available free of cost the total treatment cost to treat 1 m3 of contaminated water by the sunlight cu ii h2o2 system was determined to be 80 1 or 0 8 which is 4 times cheaper than visible light led cu ii h2o2 350 or 4 7 or 4 such a low cost treatment is well suited for water disinfection in rural regions of india the results reveal the scope of sunlight cu ii h2o2 as prospective solar energy driven aop for water disinfection in low budget scenarios 4 conclusions visible light cu ii h2o2 caused effective disinfection compared to the dark cu ii h2o2 system disinfection by visible light cu ii h2o2 has significant features such as a very low copper dosage that comply the permissible limits set by regulatory bodies and the needlessness of chemical reducing agents and organic ligands leds as irradiation source have several advantages such as long life small dimension to save space and less energy consumption electrical energy efficiency e e 1 for a log reduction of e coli and total treatment cost of visible light cu ii h2o2 were determined to be 32 64 kwh m3 and 350 m3 or 3 5 m3 respectively that is economical and affordable in many developing countries moreover cu ii h2o2 disinfection was also enhanced by sunlight similar to visible light cu ii h2o2 system combined visible light cu ii h2o2 and sunlight cu ii h2o2 disinfection systems are energy saving and useful for continuous supply of treatement water throughout day and night the findings provide strong evidence for the beneficial impact of photo irradiation under visible led light and sunlight to enhance copper based fenton disinfection declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17273,the entering of the widespread polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics into biological wastewater treatment system results in their retention in sewage sludge which inevitably enters the sludge treatment system however all previous studies regarding the impact of microplastics on sludge treatment system were conducted by directly adding microplastics to system and focusing on anaerobic sludge digestion although pet microplastics commonly enter into the biological wastewater treatment system first before sludge being subsequently treated the potential impact of the microplastics on waste activated sludge was aerobic digestion is also completely missing therefore herein the influences of pet microplastics with different entry paths on was aerobic digestion as well as the key mechanisms involved was firstly explored experimental results demonstrated that compared to the control test the entering of pet microplastics to biological wastewater treatment system inhibited was aerobic digestion by 10 9 0 1 through the decreased hydrolysis although was solubilization during aerobic digestion was improved due to the change of generated was characteristics in contrast when pet microplastics was directly added to the sludge aerobic digester there was little impact on solubilization while the hydrolysis were inhibited seriously thereby suppressing was aerobic digestion more severely by 28 9 0 1 further investigation revealed that pet microplastics reduced the populations of key bacteria e g saprospiraceae chitinophagaceae and xanthomonadaceae involved in aerobic digestion via induced oxidative stress or and releasing toxic chemical this study provided a more accurate approach to assessing the real situation regarding the influences of pet microplastics on aerobic sludge digestion graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aerobic digestion polyethylene terephthalate entry paths waste activated sludge microbial community 1 introduction activated sludge process as the most common method used in current wastewater treatment plants wwtps is often accompanied by large amounts of excess sludge generation which needs to be stabilized prior to final disposal due to economic and environmental factors foladori et al 2010 fytili et al 2009 anaerobic digestion and aerobic digestion techniques are extensively applied in wwtps for sewage sludge stabilization anaerobic digestion is promising for sludge stabilization reduction and energy recovery in form of methane thus it has been generally adopted by large sized wwtps appels et al 2011 however anaerobic digestion incurs substantial capital costs related to the biogas stream capture and enclosed operation owing to simple operation process and low overhead aerobic digestion has been a popular option for small and medium sized wwtps in australia europe and north america kelly et al 2003 liu et al 2011 microplastics here defined as synthetic polymers measuring size 5 mm are manufactured for commercial and industrial use such as detergents cosmetics textiles medical supplies and paints mahon et al 2016 wang et al 2018a the increasing global utilization and disposal of microplastics however has resulted in the microplastic pollution rapidly becoming a pressing environmental issue sun et al 2019 to date monitoring efforts found that microplastics have impinged on almost all aquatic environments across the globe including freshwater seas and oceans and even polar areas cole et al 2011 bergmann et al 2017 eerkes medrano et al 2015 thompson et al 2004 laboratory based biology toxicological tests reveal that microplastic pollution is threatening the ecosystem ivar do sul and costa 2014 for example microplastics have been shown to trigger a series of disruptions on energetic reserves photosynthesis respiration growth rate and fecundity in microorganisms plankton and invertebrates cole et al 2015 gardon et al 2018 lee et al 2013 liu et al 2020 the chemical additives are incorporated into microplastics in the process to improve their properties suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 it is reported that microplastics inducing toxicity damages towards invertebrates might be associated with the chemical additives leached from microplastics with prolonged exposure de silva et al 2016 for example the mortality of amphibalanus amphitrite increased when exposed to leachates from seven categories of microplastics such as polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics li et al 2015 wwtps have been identified as important transfer pathways for microplastics from municipal or industrial areas to the aquatic environment murphy et al 2016 with great adsorption ability 95 99 of microplastics in the wastewater were captured by the activated sludge thereby inevitably entering excess sludge treatment systems carr et al 2016 li et al 2018 our previous study demonstrated that direct microplastics addtion inhibited the anaerobic digestion of excess sludge by causing cytotoxicity for anaerobic microorganisms involved wei et al 2019a in reality microplastics commonly enter the biological wastewater treatment system first and then enter sludge treatment systems however all the previous studies in literature investigated the effects of microplastics on sludge digestion system by a direct addition of microplastics in digester which cannot reflect the real situation furthermore although the microplastics affecting anaerobic sludge digestion has been confirmed to the best of our knowledge such potential impact of microplastics on aerobic sludge digestion is also completely missing the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impacts of microplastics with different entry paths i e flowing from biological wastewater treatment system and direct addition in the was digester on the aerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was and further to reveal the mechanisms via a more scientific approach although various types of microplastics with different shapes size and polymer compositions have been found in the real systems pet microplastics is confirmed to be one of the most common microplastics being detected in was mahon et al 2016 due to their global utilization thus it was selected as the model microplastics for study to better understand the mechanisms behind to reflect the real situation the pet microplastics were initially fed to a biological wastewater treatment system and the was with pet microplastics produced was then also aerobically digested for comparison by comparing the different influences of pet microplastics with two different entry paths on was aerobic digestion this work is expected to reveal that selecting proper method close to the real situation is vital to accurately assess the toxicity of pet microplastics on sludge aerobic digestion finally the mechanisms of pet microplastics with the two different entry paths affecting was aerobic digestion were explored through key transformation steps oxidative stress and toxic leachates 2 materials and methods 2 1 pet microplastics the pet microplastics with average size of 0 2 mm for experiments were purchased from zhongcheng co ltd china the morphology of pet microplastics shown in fig s1 in supporting information si was observed by the motic microscope ba410e with a color digital camera axiocam 506 and their average size was confirmed using oplenic software 2 2 sludge preparation and characterization two parent sequencing batch reactors sbr1 and sbr2 for biological nutrient removal in our lab were used for experiments the synthetic wastewater compositions and the operation procedures of two sbrs were detailed in si two sbrs had been operated over 95 days and reached relatively stable removal efficiencies for nitrogen 81 2 and phosphorus 98 2 the concentration of microplastics in real municipal wastewater was about 15 particles l murphy et al 2016 in this work sbr1 continued to be operated as before si while sbr2 was fed with synthetic wastewater containing 15 particles l of pet microplastics here we prepared pet spiked samples with the exact concentrations through equivalent mass dosing which was calculated using density size and concentration of pet microplastics as detailed in previous publication wei et al 2019b pet microplastics stocks were sonicated at 50 khz for 60 s before being diluted to the exposure level in order to avoid their aggregation in the wastewater all other operational conditions remained unchanged both sbrs reached stable state again after culturing for 62 d from day 63 on the sludge wasted from sbr1 and sbr2 during 90 days follow up operation over 4 srts were collected thickened and labeled as was c and was e respectively specially pet microplastics in was e were detected with the concentration of 54 4 particles g ts according to the detailed method in si after skimming pretreatment to eliminate the possible interference of microplastics as previously described wei et al 2020 the regular characteristics including the total solids ts volatile solids vs total chemical oxygen demand tcod and ph in the was c and was e were measured respectively the sludge particle size was determined using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 uk the sludge surface hydrophobicity and charge was determined through the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons assay and colloidal titration method respectively rosenberg et al 1980 wilen et al 2003 polyhydroxyalkanoates pha content in sludge was analyzed using a gc as the methods described previously tong and chen 2007 yuan et al 2006 identification of the gram positive bacteria and gram negative bacteria in sludge was conducted using gram staining method as detailed in si digesting sludge was collected from the aerobic unit of a local wwtp receiving primarily domestic wastewater this sludge was used to aerobically degrade the was with the details shown in the section 2 3 the regular characteristics of was and the digesting sludge were listed in si table s1 2 3 experiments of was aerobic digestion and calculation two sets of experiments were carried out to explore the influences of pet microplastics entering into wwtps on was aerobic digestion in the first set four groups of aerobic digesters reactor control reactor experiment reactor dose and rector blank were conducted with the details shown in table s2 the 0 3 l of was c was respectively put into reactor control and reactor dose and 0 3 l of was e was transferred into reactor experiment pet microplastics were then dosed to reactor dose to make the final concentration of 54 particles g ts which was the same as that in was e the 1 4 l of digesting sludge as inoculum was added to each digester which resulted in the vs mass ratio of digesting sludge to was being 1 7 obviously reactor control without pet microplastics was set as control group this control test without adding pet microplastics would account for the impacts of the presence of other microplastics with different shapes size and polymer compositions if there were any the real situation regarding the effects of pet microplastics entering into biological wastewater treatment system on was aerobic digestion could be assessed in the reactor experiment while reactor dose showed the influences of direct addition of pet microplastics rector blank was served as the blank group with 0 3 l of tap water instead of was to indicate the aerobic digestion of digesting sludge all tests were performed in triplicate the dissolved oxygen do and ph in each aerobic digester during test period were maintained at 4 0 mg l and 7 0 0 1 respectively the aerobic digestion tests lasted for 15 days corresponding to the sludge retention time srt of the common full scale aerobic digester the vs and inorganic nitrogen nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations in each aerobic digester were measured every 24 h triplicate samples were collected from each digester for microbial community analysis the degradation extent d t of was during the aerobic digestion in each test was calculated from the vs destruction using the equation 1 wei et al 2018 1 d t vs t 0 vs t vs t 0 blank vs t blank v r v was v s was where vs t0 and vs t are the vs in reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose at day 0 and day t respectively g l vs t0 blank and vs t blank are the vs in rector blank at day 0 and day t respectively g l vr is the working volume of aerobic digester i e 1 7 l vwas and vswas are the volume and vs concentration of was respectively the inorganic nitrogen production n t mg n g vs from was during the aerobic digestion in each test was determined according to the equation 2 2 n t n t

but with the monitor of do oxygen uptake rate our mg o2 l h during was aerobic digestion in each test was calculated from the measured do by linear regression 2 4 assessment tests of was solubilization in aerobic digestion the experiments regarding the effects of pet microplastics with different entry paths on the solubilization of was during aerobic digestion was performed with the same procedure as the above was aerobic digestion tests except that the digestion time were set at 1 d as very little released soluble organics were hydrolyzed during this time all tests were carried out in triplicate the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide before and after digestion were measured respectively the dissolved organic matter in digestion liquid was characterized by excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectrometer horiba scientific france 2 5 modelling analysis of was degradability and hydrolysis in aerobic digestion the key parameters used to describe sludge degradability are degradable percentage p and hydrolysis coefficient k day 1 both of these parameters can be estimated based on the sludge degradation curves by modern modelling technique which is a common method widely used in this field jensen et al 2014 latif et al 2017 wang et al 2018 since hydrolysis step is considered the rate limiting step during sludge degradation a first order kinetic model equation 3 was employed using aquasim 2 1d residual sum of squares rss between the objective data and model was used as the objective function batstone et al 2009 3 p t p 0 1 e k t where p t is the degradation extent of was in each test at day t p0 is the degradation potential of was in each test and the remaining part was considered to be non degradable the degradable but not degraded fraction was determined by the difference between p0 and the measured final degradation extent of was i e p15 2 6 biotoxicity tests of oxidative stress and leachates the extent of oxidative stress was indicated by the generation of reactive oxygen species ros thus the ros levels in aerobic digesters were examined to determine the toxic effect of ros induced by pet microplastics the ros scavenging assay was performed with the antioxidants i e superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat addition to remove generated ros and protect microorganisms from oxidative stress briefly sod and cat 1 g l were also dosed in reactor experiment and reactor dose at the beginning of aerobic digestion assay and then the ros level with was degradation extent was measured and compared with those in reactor control the main chemical additives used for pet microplastics production and processing are di n butyl phthalate dbp di 2 ethyl hexyl phthalate dehp diethyl phthalate dep benzyl butyl phthalate bbp and dimethyl phthalate dmp according to the manufacturers and previous literatures kiani et al 2018 salazar beltrán et al 2018 thus the concentrations of these additives in reactor experiment and reactor dose during assay period were measured as described in si to determine the toxic effect of additives leached from pet microplastics similar aerobic digestion tests were conducted except that was was replaced by glucose solution with the same volume and cod level during aerobic digestion period the additives with corresponding concentrations instead of pet microplastics were then dosed in corresponding digester which was labeled as reactor control ii reactor experiment ii and reactor dose ii respectively for each test the measurements of lactate dehydrogenase ldh and dna were conducted to indicate cell membrane integrity of digesting sludge also the cells viability of digesting sludge was determined using live dead baclight bacterial viability kit 2 7 chemical and microbial analytical methods the concentrations of vs ts and tcod were measured using standard methods apha 1998 the filtered sample from mixed liquor was prepared using millipore filter unit 0 45 μm pore size for analyzing scod soluble proteins and polysaccharides according to previous literature wei et al 2019a the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were determined with a flow injection analyzer lachat quikchem8000 the do and ph value were monitored by do and ph meter illumina miseq sequencing was employed to analyze the microbial community as detailed in si the ldh cytotoxicity assay kit biovision usa was used to measure ldh level the measurement of released dna released was performed using the methods detailed in liang et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 pet microplastics with different entry paths differently inhibited was aerobic digestion reactor dose direct addition and reactor experiment flow from biological wastewater treatment system in this work were carried out to investigate the effects of pet microplastics with different entry paths on was aerobic digestion reactor control was conducted without the presence of pet microplastics rector blank was used to exclude the impact of the inoculum and calculate was degradation in other three reactors was aerobic digestion was assessed by degradation extent on basis of vs inorganic nitrogen production and oxygen consumption during aerobic digestion period degradation extent d t of was in all cases during the 15 days aerobic digestion period was shown in fig 1 it can be seen that the degradation extent d t of was over the 15 days test period without the presence of pet microplastics i e in reactor control was 28 3 1 1 the maximal degradation extents of was in reactor experiment and reactor dose dropped to 25 2 0 8 and 20 1 0 6 representing the significant p 0 0168 and 0 0003 decrease of 10 9 0 1 and 28 9 0 1 in comparison to that in reactor control besides was aerobic digestion leads to the production of inorganic nitrogen thus the more was degradation will generate more inorganic nitrogen fig 1 demonstrated the inorganic nitrogen production from was in each reactor during the 15 days aligning with the data of was degradation inorganic nitrogen production from was in reactor experiment and reactor dose decreased to 89 4 0 1 and 71 5 0 1 of the control test the ratio of inorganic nitrogen production to was degradation in each case was 0 09 mg n mg vs which was in accordance with the inorganic nitrogen ratio in sludge metcalf and eddy 2003 fig 1 also showed the our profiles during was aerobic digestion in all reactors which allowed the calculation of the total oxygen consumption the oxygen consumption measured includes autotrophic and heterotrophic oxygen consumption autotrophic oxygen consumption is attributed to oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate whereas heterotrophic oxygen consumption was due to the oxidation of cod a summary of oxygen consumption calculation was listed in table 1 the total oxygen consumptions in reactor experiment 1222 1 mg o2 l and reactor dose 1113 2 mg o2 l were lower than that in reactor control 1310 8 mg o2 l the autotrophic oxygen consumption can be estimated by inorganic nitrogen production the calculated oxygen consumption due to was oxidation in reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose was 872 6 756 8 and 627 8 mg o2 respectively according to degradation extent of was measured in fig 1 and the ratio of cod to vs of was added in table s1 was oxidation in reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose provided 950 9 839 2 and 675 4 mg cod respectively which was very similar to the calculated heterotrophic oxygen consumption within 10 confirming the accuracy of the results all reliable data revealed that the entering of pet microplastics initial into biological wastewater treatment system inhibited aerobic digestion of generated was while the direct addition of pet microplastics to aerobic digester suppressed was degradation more severely the possible reasons were explored in the following sections 3 2 pet microplastics with different entry paths distinctively affected was solubilisation in aerobic digestion it is well known that was solubilization with the release of soluble substances is the first step of sludge aerobic digestion the potential impacts of pet microplastics with different entry paths on was solubilization was thus assessed to further explore the function of pet microplastics in aerobic digestion process fig 2 a showed the soluble cod release in digestion liquor 560 15 mg cod l in reactor dose was comparable p 0 58 with that in reactor control in contrast the soluble cod release in reactor experiment was 1 12 times p 0 02 more than it was in reactor control 615 15 versus 550 25 mg cod l however the vs concentration fed in each reactor also was measured table s1 and found to be similar all at 8 5 8 8 g l p 0 18 thus this implied the entering of pet microplastics into biological wastewater treatment system did not affect the organic substrates level in generated was but resulted in more particulate organics in was becoming soluble organics during aerobic digestion process a similar trend was also observed in the cases of soluble proteins and polysaccharides that are the two main constituents of scod in was accounting for 60 the soluble proteins and polysaccharides in reactor experiment was 289 9 mg cod l and 69 2 mg cod l representing the relative increases of 10 3 0 1 p 0 030 and 23 2 0 1 p 0 001 compared to those in reactor control but the concentrations of soluble proteins p 0 64 and polysaccharides p 0 45 in reactor dose were similar with those in reactor control this corroborated the scod results apparently pet microplastics entering into wastewater biological treatment process improved the solubilization of generated was in aerobic digestion while the directly added pet microplastics in aerobic digester did not affect was solubilization during aerobic digestion however not all the soluble organics released from was could be biodegraded during aerobic digestion e g humic substances wang et al 2018b eem technique was employed to characterize the bio degradability of soluble organics released in digestion liquid in each reactor as shown in fig 2b d the soluble organics in three reactors located in region i i e soluble microbial byproduct like substances and region ii i e humic acid like substances the soluble organics in region i are generally considered as biodegradable substrates whereas the organics in region ii are thought as the non biodegradable substrates the fluorescence intensity of region i in reactor experiment was obviously higher than it in reactor control and reactor dose but there is no clear difference in fluorescence intensity of region ii among three reactors suggesting that compared to the direct addition of pet microplastics to aerobic digester pet microplastics initially entering biological wastewater treatment system promoted the biodegradability of the soluble organics released from generated was in aerobic disgetion it was reported that sludge solubilization can be increased with the decrease of its floc size vigueras carmona et al 2011 in this study was produced from biological wastewater treatment system without pet microplastics exposure i e was c were fed in reactor control and reactor dose while was generated from biological wastewater treatment system with pet microplastics exposure i e was e were fed in reactor experiment sludge particle size of was c and was e were thus determined by laser particle size analyzer the data in fig 3 a suggested that particle size of was c and was e exhibited a binomial distribution in the range from 0 1 to 1000 μm and was e performed a shift in particle size distribution towards smaller sizes also the mean volume diameter and medium particle diameter were calculated to compare the sludge size in fig 3b was e presented much smaller mean volume diameter and medium particle diameter of 55 1 p 0 008 and 109 2 μm p 0 003 compared to was c having the mean volume diameter and medium particle diameter of 59 1 and 117 1 μm this indicated that the presence of pet microplastics in the biological wastewater treatment system decreased particle size of generated was which is possibly attributed to the changes in its surface hydrophobicity and charge sludge particle size has been reported to decrease with the decline of its surface hydrophobicity and negative surface charge jin et al 2003 the current study showed that the presence of pet microplastics in the biological wastewater treatment system resulted in lower relative hydrophobicity and less negative surface charge 72 4 and 0 44 meq g ts of generated was when compared with the condition of no pet microplastics exposure 83 1 and 0 59 meq g ts thereby decreasing sludge particle size hence the entering of pet microplastics initial into biological wastewater treatment system decreased particle size of generated was which was one reason for enhanced sludge solubilization in aerobic digestion being observed in reactor experiment it was also documented previously that pha content and gram staining bacteria composition had impacts on sludge cell breakage wang et al 2013 was e and was c derived from the identical biological wastewater treatment reactors with and without pet microplastics exposure respectively fig 3b showed that the pha content in was e was 1 56 times p 0 0003 more than it was in was c this indicated that the presence of pet microplastics in the biological wastewater treatment system affected the pha content in generated was higher pha content in sludge generally makes sludge cell more fragile and easily breakage therefore the presence of pet microplastics in the biological wastewater treatment system would promote the generated was to be solubilized during aerobic digestion besides the cell walls of gram positive bacteria gpb are surrounded with thick and multilayered peptidoglycan sheath whereas cell walls of gram negative bacteria gnb are composed of thin and one layer peptidoglycan compared to gram staining bacteria composition in was c fig 3c was e had higher ratio of gnb gpb which would therefore benefit for the breakage of cell sludge fig 3d 3 3 pet microplastics with different entry paths dissimilarly suppressed was hydrolysis and degradability in aerobic digestion was hydrolysis and degradability in all cases were determined by model based analysis as summarized in fig 4 the first order kinetic model could fit the experimental data of was degradation in each reactor well with correlation coefficient r2 0 95 in all cases fig 4a and thus is considered to be valid and reliable this modelling technique enables to make outcomes more comparable and compatible was in reactor control had a hydrolysis coefficient k of 0 25 0 01 day 1 while it in reactor experiment and reactor dose significantly p 0 008 and 0 002 decreased to 0 21 0 01 and 0 19 0 01 day 1 fig 4b this indicated that the presence of pet microplastics have adverse influence on was hydrolysis during aerobic digestion and direct entry of pet microplastics caused greater inhibition than that flow from biological wastewater treatment system based on the results of model analysis and reactors tests the relative fractions of was including the degraded fraction in the reactor degradable but not degraded fraction and non degradable fraction were further analyzed the results in fig 4b showed that pet microplastics added directly and pet microplastics flowed from biological wastewater treatment system significantly decreased was degradability from 29 0 0 5 to 21 2 0 5 p 4 42e 05 and 26 9 0 6 p 0 0096 respectively specially almost all the degradable fraction of the was have been degraded in reactor control throughout the 15 day aerobic digestion as indicated by an extremely low percentage of degradable but not degraded fraction i e 0 7 0 1 in contrast pet microplastics exposure especially pet microplastics flowed from biological wastewater treatment system significantly p 0 0003 and 0 0081 increased this fraction in was and reduced stability of aerobic digestate this probably because the entering of pet microplastics to biological wastewater treatment system improved the solubilization of generated was in aerobic digestion but inhibited in reactor degradation of soluble organics 3 4 pet microplastics with different entry paths variously changed microbial community in was aerobic digester microbial sequences taxa from reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose were performed using illumina miseq sequencing technique to disclose the variations of microbial community after exposed to pet microplastics with different entry paths the microbial diversity in terms of the rarefaction curves and diversity indices were illustrated in fig 5 rarefaction curves fig 5a revealed that more effective sequences 32345 were yielded in reactor control than reactor experiment 30927 and reactor dose 25689 indicating that the presence of pet microplastics especially for direct addition reduced the total microbial populations three rarefaction curves all nearly reached plateau finally implying that sequencing data had a high quality and more sequencing reads would generate few new species schauer gimenez et al 2010 additionally high coverage estimator 0 98 0 99 values in the samples from three reactors fig 5b demonstrated that the sequencing results were sufficient for effective characterization of the microbial communities he et al 2020 meanwhile similar p 0 05 diversity estimators chao and shannon were obtained from samples with and without pet microplastics exposure suggesting that minimal effect of pet microplastics on microbial diversity taxonomic abundance scenarios of microbial samples from three aerobic reactors in fig 5c demonstrated general differences in the abundances of bacterial phyla highly dominant bacteria in three reactors comprised proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria many bacteria in these phyla were responsible the degradation of organic substrates e g proteins and polysaccharides duan et al 2019 reactor control harbored these phyla with higher abundances i e 85 6 0 5 of the total bacterial populations in contrast pet microplastics with direct addition significantly decreased p 0 0002 their populations to 81 2 0 3 and pet microplastics flowed from biological wastewater treatment system further remarkably reduced p 0 0001 the abundances of these bacterial phyla to 78 9 0 6 which could be linked to the less was degradation observed in the reactor dose and reactor experiment the population shifts of the microbial community in three reactors were further explored in terms of the top 10 abundant families fig 5d and are widely distributed throughout various aerobic habitats xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 rhodocyclaceae which was the predominant bacterial family shared in all systems in this study and have been reported to be abundant in wastewater treatment activated sludge wang et al 2012 was reduced in the presence of pet microplastics saprospiraceae and chitinophagaceae which were the second dominant family members showed a higher abundance of 8 1 0 5 and 5 3 0 5 in the reactor control saprospiraceae play the important role in the breakdown of complex organic compounds in the environment mcilroy and nielsen 2014 and their relative abundance in reactor experiment and reactor dose decreased p 0 010 and 0 002 by 20 9 0 1 and 28 4 0 1 respectively similarly the reduction of chitinophagaceae family members known as the degraders of chitin and cellulose rosenberg 2014 were observed in the presence of pet microplastics p 0 014 and 0 001 another dominant family the abundance of xanthomonadaceae which is a kind of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria lueders et al 2006 was significantly higher in reactor control 2 8 0 3 than that in reactor experiment 1 8 0 3 p 0 015 and reactor dose 1 3 0 2 p 0 002 besides nitrosomonadaceae which have been reported to have the ability of oxidizing ammonia prosser et al 2014 were detected and appeared to be less abundant in reactors with pet microplastics than without p 0 021 and 0 036 all of these variations revealed that the pet microplastics exposure changed microbial communities along the direction against was aerobic degradation and pet microplastics with direct addition had more adverse influence than those flowed from biological wastewater treatment system which was consistent with the aerobic digestion performances of was observed in the studied reactors 3 5 insights into the different mechanisms of pet microplastics with different entry paths affecting was aerobic digestion as demonstrated above the presence of pet microplastics inhibited aerobic digestion of was via the inhibition of hydrolysis and the shift of the microbial community and pet microplastics with direct addition restrained was degradation more severely compared to pet microplastics flowed from biological wastewater treatment system which raised two key questions how pet microplastics induced such suppression influences why two different entry paths of pet microplastics caused different performances the potential mechanisms of pet microplastics with different entry paths affecting was aerobic digestion were thus explored to answer these questions our previous studies found that microplastics exposure could up regulate oxidative stress toward anaerobes via inducing ros production in anaerobic environment wei et al 2019b wei et al 2019c in general microbial cells have the ability of removing generated ros by antioxidant enzymes thereby mediating oxidative stress xia et al 2008 nevertheless such antioxidant defense is restricted due to the limited amount of antioxidant enzymes the excessive ros level can destroy redox balance and activate redox sensitive signaling pathways e g the map kinases and nf kb cascades eventually resulting in cytotoxicity and even cellular apoptosis microplastics also have been found to cause toxicity toward aquatic invertebrates via induced oxidative stress jeong et al 2016 lei et al 2018 in this study ros level as the indicator of oxidative stress in reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose were measured as seen from fig 6 a the presence of pet microplastics in aerobic system increased ros level by 49 52 compared to the control and there was no significant difference in entry paths of pet microplastics to determine the role of ros induced by pet microplastics in reducing was degradation during aerobic digestion the extra ros scavengers i e sod and cat were initially added in each reactor in the aerobic digestion test results showed that ros level in reactor experiment and reactor dose with ros scavengers dropped to the similar level with it in reactor control correspondingly the inhibition degree on was degradation was clearly alleviated especially in reactor experiment achieving up to 97 5 of the control this finding revealed that oxidative stress induced by pet microplastics might be one of key factors for inhibiting was aerobic digestion and the different entry paths of pet microplastics in aerobic digester had little impact on the level of oxidative stress induced bejgarn et al 2015 demonstrated that more than one third of microplastics i e pe ps and pet leached chemical additives potential influences of leachates from microplastics on invertebrates crustaceans anaerobe and microalgae have also been documented in recent years chen et al 2002 wei et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 many chemicals leached can induce biotoxicity within the ng l ug l range cole et al 2011 in this leaching experiment the main chemical additives i e dehp dep bbp and dmp were not detected in all reactors and only dbp was detected in reactor dose suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 also found that dbp was the prominent chemicals leached from pet microplastics however few dbp was detected in reactor experiment presumably because dbp has been released during the prolonged exposure of pet microplastics in biological wastewater treatment system the concentrations of dbp leached in reactor dose vs time were recorded in fig s2 to determine the toxic effect of dbp leached from pet microplastics reactor control ii reactor experiment ii and reactor dose ii containing aerobic digesting sludge with corresponding dbp were conducted the cell membrane integrity of aerobic digesting sludge in three reactors was evaluated in terms of ldh and dna release fig 6b compared to reactor control ii and reactor experiment ii without the dbp addition ldh showed a corresponding increase in reactor dose ii exposed to dbp an increased release of dna was also observed live and dead cells in three reactors were presented in fig 6c e to indicate cells viability of aerobic digesting sludge the presence of dbp leached from pet microplastics did increase the fractions of dead cells observed in reactor dose ii by 7 3 0 5 compared to reactor control ii and reactor experiment ii without dbp exposure this indicated that the released dbp from pet microplastics posed a serious hazard to aerobic digesting sludge resulting in cell death of aerobic digesting sludge which would be another factor for the toxicity of pet microplastics 3 6 overall understanding and implications from the study above it can be seen that pet microplastics had different toxicity influences on sludge aerobic digestion under different entry paths when pet microplastics entered into biological wastewater treatment system the subsequent sludge aerobic digestion was inhibited since the sludge solubilization increased and the hydrolysis decreased however when pet microplastics was directly added to the sludge aerobic digester there was little impact on solubilization while the hydrolysis were inhibited obviously leading to more deteriorative performance of sludge aerobic digestion pet microplastics reduced the populations of key bacteria through induced oxidative stress or and releasing toxic chemical note that this study used pet microplastic fragments but the different shapes and sizes of pet microplastics would potentially affect the leaching rate of chemicals through equilibrium partitioning therefore future efforts could be devoted to investigate the potential impacts of microplastics with different shapes e g fibre and granular size ranges 1 50000 μm and polymer compositions on was aerobic digestion overall this study provided a more accurate approach and a more to assessing the real situation regarding the influences of pet microplastics on sludge aerobic digestion although pet microplastics were used to represent the overall microplastics at environmental concentration this work can serve as a solid step towards the full understanding of the impacts of microplastics under environmental realistic conditions at the present stage if a considerable amount of microplastics enter aerobic digester a larger aerobic digester or a longer sludge retention time srt might be required for achieving the similar performance of sludge aerobic digestion as the system without microplastics exposure therefore considering the increased production and discharge of plastic products and their adverse environmental impact a more holistic manage approach may be required to reduce littering of plastics and develop alternative biodegradable materials thereby minimizing the potential impacts of microplastics on biotechnological systems in wwtp such as sludge aerobic digester additionally effective microplastics target treatment technology should be developed and applied in wastewater and waste sludge treatment before significant amount of microplastics enter into biological wastewater treatment system especially the direct entering of considerable amount of microplastics into sludge treatment system should be avoided 4 conclusions the entering of pet microplastics to biological wastewater treatment system inhibited was aerobic digestion by 10 9 0 1 compared to the control test smaller sludge particle size and increased pha content and ratio of gnb gpb in generated was contributed to the enhanced was solubilization in aerobic digestion but the oxidative stress induced by pet microplastics inhibited was hydrolysis however when pet microplastics was directly added to the sludge aerobic digester was aerobic digestion was suppressed more severely there was little impact on was solubilization but the hydrolysis were inhibited seriously through induced oxidative stress and releasing toxic chemical pet microplastics caused the shift of the microbial community toward the direction against aerobic digestion as such pet microplastics had significantly different toxicity influences on sludge aerobic digestion for different entry paths declaration of competing interest

17273,the entering of the widespread polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics into biological wastewater treatment system results in their retention in sewage sludge which inevitably enters the sludge treatment system however all previous studies regarding the impact of microplastics on sludge treatment system were conducted by directly adding microplastics to system and focusing on anaerobic sludge digestion although pet microplastics commonly enter into the biological wastewater treatment system first before sludge being subsequently treated the potential impact of the microplastics on waste activated sludge was aerobic digestion is also completely missing therefore herein the influences of pet microplastics with different entry paths on was aerobic digestion as well as the key mechanisms involved was firstly explored experimental results demonstrated that compared to the control test the entering of pet microplastics to biological wastewater treatment system inhibited was aerobic digestion by 10 9 0 1 through the decreased hydrolysis although was solubilization during aerobic digestion was improved due to the change of generated was characteristics in contrast when pet microplastics was directly added to the sludge aerobic digester there was little impact on solubilization while the hydrolysis were inhibited seriously thereby suppressing was aerobic digestion more severely by 28 9 0 1 further investigation revealed that pet microplastics reduced the populations of key bacteria e g saprospiraceae chitinophagaceae and xanthomonadaceae involved in aerobic digestion via induced oxidative stress or and releasing toxic chemical this study provided a more accurate approach to assessing the real situation regarding the influences of pet microplastics on aerobic sludge digestion graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aerobic digestion polyethylene terephthalate entry paths waste activated sludge microbial community 1 introduction activated sludge process as the most common method used in current wastewater treatment plants wwtps is often accompanied by large amounts of excess sludge generation which needs to be stabilized prior to final disposal due to economic and environmental factors foladori et al 2010 fytili et al 2009 anaerobic digestion and aerobic digestion techniques are extensively applied in wwtps for sewage sludge stabilization anaerobic digestion is promising for sludge stabilization reduction and energy recovery in form of methane thus it has been generally adopted by large sized wwtps appels et al 2011 however anaerobic digestion incurs substantial capital costs related to the biogas stream capture and enclosed operation owing to simple operation process and low overhead aerobic digestion has been a popular option for small and medium sized wwtps in australia europe and north america kelly et al 2003 liu et al 2011 microplastics here defined as synthetic polymers measuring size 5 mm are manufactured for commercial and industrial use such as detergents cosmetics textiles medical supplies and paints mahon et al 2016 wang et al 2018a the increasing global utilization and disposal of microplastics however has resulted in the microplastic pollution rapidly becoming a pressing environmental issue sun et al 2019 to date monitoring efforts found that microplastics have impinged on almost all aquatic environments across the globe including freshwater seas and oceans and even polar areas cole et al 2011 bergmann et al 2017 eerkes medrano et al 2015 thompson et al 2004 laboratory based biology toxicological tests reveal that microplastic pollution is threatening the ecosystem ivar do sul and costa 2014 for example microplastics have been shown to trigger a series of disruptions on energetic reserves photosynthesis respiration growth rate and fecundity in microorganisms plankton and invertebrates cole et al 2015 gardon et al 2018 lee et al 2013 liu et al 2020 the chemical additives are incorporated into microplastics in the process to improve their properties suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 it is reported that microplastics inducing toxicity damages towards invertebrates might be associated with the chemical additives leached from microplastics with prolonged exposure de silva et al 2016 for example the mortality of amphibalanus amphitrite increased when exposed to leachates from seven categories of microplastics such as polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics li et al 2015 wwtps have been identified as important transfer pathways for microplastics from municipal or industrial areas to the aquatic environment murphy et al 2016 with great adsorption ability 95 99 of microplastics in the wastewater were captured by the activated sludge thereby inevitably entering excess sludge treatment systems carr et al 2016 li et al 2018 our previous study demonstrated that direct microplastics addtion inhibited the anaerobic digestion of excess sludge by causing cytotoxicity for anaerobic microorganisms involved wei et al 2019a in reality microplastics commonly enter the biological wastewater treatment system first and then enter sludge treatment systems however all the previous studies in literature investigated the effects of microplastics on sludge digestion system by a direct addition of microplastics in digester which cannot reflect the real situation furthermore although the microplastics affecting anaerobic sludge digestion has been confirmed to the best of our knowledge such potential impact of microplastics on aerobic sludge digestion is also completely missing the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impacts of microplastics with different entry paths i e flowing from biological wastewater treatment system and direct addition in the was digester on the aerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was and further to reveal the mechanisms via a more scientific approach although various types of microplastics with different shapes size and polymer compositions have been found in the real systems pet microplastics is confirmed to be one of the most common microplastics being detected in was mahon et al 2016 due to their global utilization thus it was selected as the model microplastics for study to better understand the mechanisms behind to reflect the real situation the pet microplastics were initially fed to a biological wastewater treatment system and the was with pet microplastics produced was then also aerobically digested for comparison by comparing the different influences of pet microplastics with two different entry paths on was aerobic digestion this work is expected to reveal that selecting proper method close to the real situation is vital to accurately assess the toxicity of pet microplastics on sludge aerobic digestion finally the mechanisms of pet microplastics with the two different entry paths affecting was aerobic digestion were explored through key transformation steps oxidative stress and toxic leachates 2 materials and methods 2 1 pet microplastics the pet microplastics with average size of 0 2 mm for experiments were purchased from zhongcheng co ltd china the morphology of pet microplastics shown in fig s1 in supporting information si was observed by the motic microscope ba410e with a color digital camera axiocam 506 and their average size was confirmed using oplenic software 2 2 sludge preparation and characterization two parent sequencing batch reactors sbr1 and sbr2 for biological nutrient removal in our lab were used for experiments the synthetic wastewater compositions and the operation procedures of two sbrs were detailed in si two sbrs had been operated over 95 days and reached relatively stable removal efficiencies for nitrogen 81 2 and phosphorus 98 2 the concentration of microplastics in real municipal wastewater was about 15 particles l murphy et al 2016 in this work sbr1 continued to be operated as before si while sbr2 was fed with synthetic wastewater containing 15 particles l of pet microplastics here we prepared pet spiked samples with the exact concentrations through equivalent mass dosing which was calculated using density size and concentration of pet microplastics as detailed in previous publication wei et al 2019b pet microplastics stocks were sonicated at 50 khz for 60 s before being diluted to the exposure level in order to avoid their aggregation in the wastewater all other operational conditions remained unchanged both sbrs reached stable state again after culturing for 62 d from day 63 on the sludge wasted from sbr1 and sbr2 during 90 days follow up operation over 4 srts were collected thickened and labeled as was c and was e respectively specially pet microplastics in was e were detected with the concentration of 54 4 particles g ts according to the detailed method in si after skimming pretreatment to eliminate the possible interference of microplastics as previously described wei et al 2020 the regular characteristics including the total solids ts volatile solids vs total chemical oxygen demand tcod and ph in the was c and was e were measured respectively the sludge particle size was determined using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 uk the sludge surface hydrophobicity and charge was determined through the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons assay and colloidal titration method respectively rosenberg et al 1980 wilen et al 2003 polyhydroxyalkanoates pha content in sludge was analyzed using a gc as the methods described previously tong and chen 2007 yuan et al 2006 identification of the gram positive bacteria and gram negative bacteria in sludge was conducted using gram staining method as detailed in si digesting sludge was collected from the aerobic unit of a local wwtp receiving primarily domestic wastewater this sludge was used to aerobically degrade the was with the details shown in the section 2 3 the regular characteristics of was and the digesting sludge were listed in si table s1 2 3 experiments of was aerobic digestion and calculation two sets of experiments were carried out to explore the influences of pet microplastics entering into wwtps on was aerobic digestion in the first set four groups of aerobic digesters reactor control reactor experiment reactor dose and rector blank were conducted with the details shown in table s2 the 0 3 l of was c was respectively put into reactor control and reactor dose and 0 3 l of was e was transferred into reactor experiment pet microplastics were then dosed to reactor dose to make the final concentration of 54 particles g ts which was the same as that in was e the 1 4 l of digesting sludge as inoculum was added to each digester which resulted in the vs mass ratio of digesting sludge to was being 1 7 obviously reactor control without pet microplastics was set as control group this control test without adding pet microplastics would account for the impacts of the presence of other microplastics with different shapes size and polymer compositions if there were any the real situation regarding the effects of pet microplastics entering into biological wastewater treatment system on was aerobic digestion could be assessed in the reactor experiment while reactor dose showed the influences of direct addition of pet microplastics rector blank was served as the blank group with 0 3 l of tap water instead of was to indicate the aerobic digestion of digesting sludge all tests were performed in triplicate the dissolved oxygen do and ph in each aerobic digester during test period were maintained at 4 0 mg l and 7 0 0 1 respectively the aerobic digestion tests lasted for 15 days corresponding to the sludge retention time srt of the common full scale aerobic digester the vs and inorganic nitrogen nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations in each aerobic digester were measured every 24 h triplicate samples were collected from each digester for microbial community analysis the degradation extent d t of was during the aerobic digestion in each test was calculated from the vs destruction using the equation 1 wei et al 2018 1 d t vs t 0 vs t vs t 0 blank vs t blank v r v was v s was where vs t0 and vs t are the vs in reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose at day 0 and day t respectively g l vs t0 blank and vs t blank are the vs in rector blank at day 0 and day t respectively g l vr is the working volume of aerobic digester i e 1 7 l vwas and vswas are the volume and vs concentration of was respectively the inorganic nitrogen production n t mg n g vs from was during the aerobic digestion in each test was determined according to the equation 2 2 n t n t n t 0 n t blank n t 0 blank v r v was v s was where n t and n t0 are the sum of inorganic nitrogen nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration in reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose at day t and day 0 respectively mg n l n t blank and n t0 blank are that in rector blank at day t and day 0 respectively mg n l the second set of test was carried out under the same operation as the first set but with the monitor of do oxygen uptake rate our mg o2 l h during was aerobic digestion in each test was calculated from the measured do by linear regression 2 4 assessment tests of was solubilization in aerobic digestion the experiments regarding the effects of pet microplastics with different entry paths on the solubilization of was during aerobic digestion was performed with the same procedure as the above was aerobic digestion tests except that the digestion time were set at 1 d as very little released soluble organics were hydrolyzed during this time all tests were carried out in triplicate the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide before and after digestion were measured respectively the dissolved organic matter in digestion liquid was characterized by excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectrometer horiba scientific france 2 5 modelling analysis of was degradability and hydrolysis in aerobic digestion the key parameters used to describe sludge degradability are degradable percentage p and hydrolysis coefficient k day 1 both of these parameters can be estimated based on the sludge degradation curves by modern modelling technique which is a common method widely used in this field jensen et al 2014 latif et al 2017 wang et al 2018 since hydrolysis step is considered the rate limiting step during sludge degradation a first order kinetic model equation 3 was employed using aquasim 2 1d residual sum of squares rss between the objective data and model was used as the objective function batstone et al 2009 3 p t p 0 1 e k t where p t is the degradation extent of was in each test at day t p0 is the degradation potential of was in each test and the remaining part was considered to be non degradable the degradable but not degraded fraction was determined by the difference between p0 and the measured final degradation extent of was i e p15 2 6 biotoxicity tests of oxidative stress and leachates the extent of oxidative stress was indicated by the generation of reactive oxygen species ros thus the ros levels in aerobic digesters were examined to determine the toxic effect of ros induced by pet microplastics the ros scavenging assay was performed with the antioxidants i e superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat addition to remove generated ros and protect microorganisms from oxidative stress briefly sod and cat 1 g l were also dosed in reactor experiment and reactor dose at the beginning of aerobic digestion assay and then the ros level with was degradation extent was measured and compared with those in reactor control the main chemical additives used for pet microplastics production and processing are di n butyl phthalate dbp di 2 ethyl hexyl phthalate dehp diethyl phthalate dep benzyl butyl phthalate bbp and dimethyl phthalate dmp according to the manufacturers and previous literatures kiani et al 2018 salazar beltrán et al 2018 thus the concentrations of these additives in reactor experiment and reactor dose during assay period were measured as described in si to determine the toxic effect of additives leached from pet microplastics similar aerobic digestion tests were conducted except that was was replaced by glucose solution with the same volume and cod level during aerobic digestion period the additives with corresponding concentrations instead of pet microplastics were then dosed in corresponding digester which was labeled as reactor control ii reactor experiment ii and reactor dose ii respectively for each test the measurements of lactate dehydrogenase ldh and dna were conducted to indicate cell membrane integrity of digesting sludge also the cells viability of digesting sludge was determined using live dead baclight bacterial viability kit 2 7 chemical and microbial analytical methods the concentrations of vs ts and tcod were measured using standard methods apha 1998 the filtered sample from mixed liquor was prepared using millipore filter unit 0 45 μm pore size for analyzing scod soluble proteins and polysaccharides according to previous literature wei et al 2019a the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were determined with a flow injection analyzer lachat quikchem8000 the do and ph value were monitored by do and ph meter illumina miseq sequencing was employed to analyze the microbial community as detailed in si the ldh cytotoxicity assay kit biovision usa was used to measure ldh level the measurement of released dna released was performed using the methods detailed in liang et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 pet microplastics with different entry paths differently inhibited was aerobic digestion reactor dose direct addition and reactor experiment flow from biological wastewater treatment system in this work were carried out to investigate the effects of pet microplastics with different entry paths on was aerobic digestion reactor control was conducted without the presence of pet microplastics rector blank was used to exclude the impact of the inoculum and calculate was degradation in other three reactors was aerobic digestion was assessed by degradation extent on basis of vs inorganic nitrogen production and oxygen consumption during aerobic digestion period degradation extent d t of was in all cases during the 15 days aerobic digestion period was shown in fig 1 it can be seen that the degradation extent d t of was over the 15 days test period without the presence of pet microplastics i e in reactor control was 28 3 1 1 the maximal degradation extents of was in reactor experiment and reactor dose dropped to 25 2 0 8 and 20 1 0 6 representing the significant p 0 0168 and 0 0003 decrease of 10 9 0 1 and 28 9 0 1 in comparison to that in reactor control besides was aerobic digestion leads to the production of inorganic nitrogen thus the more was degradation will generate more inorganic nitrogen fig 1 demonstrated the inorganic nitrogen production from was in each reactor during the 15 days aligning with the data of was degradation inorganic nitrogen production from was in reactor experiment and reactor dose decreased to 89 4 0 1 and 71 5 0 1 of the control test the ratio of inorganic nitrogen production to was degradation in each case was 0 09 mg n mg vs which was in accordance with the inorganic nitrogen ratio in sludge metcalf and eddy 2003 fig 1 also showed the our profiles during was aerobic digestion in all reactors which allowed the calculation of the total oxygen consumption the oxygen consumption measured includes autotrophic and heterotrophic oxygen consumption autotrophic oxygen consumption is attributed to oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate whereas heterotrophic oxygen consumption was due to the oxidation of cod a summary of oxygen consumption calculation was listed in table 1 the total oxygen consumptions in reactor experiment 1222 1 mg o2 l and reactor dose 1113 2 mg o2 l were lower than that in reactor control 1310 8 mg o2 l the autotrophic oxygen consumption can be estimated by inorganic nitrogen production the calculated oxygen consumption due to was oxidation in reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose was 872 6 756 8 and 627 8 mg o2 respectively according to degradation extent of was measured in fig 1 and the ratio of cod to vs of was added in table s1 was oxidation in reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose provided 950 9 839 2 and 675 4 mg cod respectively which was very similar to the calculated heterotrophic oxygen consumption within 10 confirming the accuracy of the results all reliable data revealed that the entering of pet microplastics initial into biological wastewater treatment system inhibited aerobic digestion of generated was while the direct addition of pet microplastics to aerobic digester suppressed was degradation more severely the possible reasons were explored in the following sections 3 2 pet microplastics with different entry paths distinctively affected was solubilisation in aerobic digestion it is well known that was solubilization with the release of soluble substances is the first step of sludge aerobic digestion the potential impacts of pet microplastics with different entry paths on was solubilization was thus assessed to further explore the function of pet microplastics in aerobic digestion process fig 2 a showed the soluble cod release in digestion liquor 560 15 mg cod l in reactor dose was comparable p 0 58 with that in reactor control in contrast the soluble cod release in reactor experiment was 1 12 times p 0 02 more than it was in reactor control 615 15 versus 550 25 mg cod l however the vs concentration fed in each reactor also was measured table s1 and found to be similar all at 8 5 8 8 g l p 0 18 thus this implied the entering of pet microplastics into biological wastewater treatment system did not affect the organic substrates level in generated was but resulted in more particulate organics in was becoming soluble organics during aerobic digestion process a similar trend was also observed in the cases of soluble proteins and polysaccharides that are the two main constituents of scod in was accounting for 60 the soluble proteins and polysaccharides in reactor experiment was 289 9 mg cod l and 69 2 mg cod l representing the relative increases of 10 3 0 1 p 0 030 and 23 2 0 1 p 0 001 compared to those in reactor control but the concentrations of soluble proteins p 0 64 and polysaccharides p 0 45 in reactor dose were similar with those in reactor control this corroborated the scod results apparently pet microplastics entering into wastewater biological treatment process improved the solubilization of generated was in aerobic digestion while the directly added pet microplastics in aerobic digester did not affect was solubilization during aerobic digestion however not all the soluble organics released from was could be biodegraded during aerobic digestion e g humic substances wang et al 2018b eem technique was employed to characterize the bio degradability of soluble organics released in digestion liquid in each reactor as shown in fig 2b d the soluble organics in three reactors located in region i i e soluble microbial byproduct like substances and region ii i e humic acid like substances the soluble organics in region i are generally considered as biodegradable substrates whereas the organics in region ii are thought as the non biodegradable substrates the fluorescence intensity of region i in reactor experiment was obviously higher than it in reactor control and reactor dose but there is no clear difference in fluorescence intensity of region ii among three reactors suggesting that compared to the direct addition of pet microplastics to aerobic digester pet microplastics initially entering biological wastewater treatment system promoted the biodegradability of the soluble organics released from generated was in aerobic disgetion it was reported that sludge solubilization can be increased with the decrease of its floc size vigueras carmona et al 2011 in this study was produced from biological wastewater treatment system without pet microplastics exposure i e was c were fed in reactor control and reactor dose while was generated from biological wastewater treatment system with pet microplastics exposure i e was e were fed in reactor experiment sludge particle size of was c and was e were thus determined by laser particle size analyzer the data in fig 3 a suggested that particle size of was c and was e exhibited a binomial distribution in the range from 0 1 to 1000 μm and was e performed a shift in particle size distribution towards smaller sizes also the mean volume diameter and medium particle diameter were calculated to compare the sludge size in fig 3b was e presented much smaller mean volume diameter and medium particle diameter of 55 1 p 0 008 and 109 2 μm p 0 003 compared to was c having the mean volume diameter and medium particle diameter of 59 1 and 117 1 μm this indicated that the presence of pet microplastics in the biological wastewater treatment system decreased particle size of generated was which is possibly attributed to the changes in its surface hydrophobicity and charge sludge particle size has been reported to decrease with the decline of its surface hydrophobicity and negative surface charge jin et al 2003 the current study showed that the presence of pet microplastics in the biological wastewater treatment system resulted in lower relative hydrophobicity and less negative surface charge 72 4 and 0 44 meq g ts of generated was when compared with the condition of no pet microplastics exposure 83 1 and 0 59 meq g ts thereby decreasing sludge particle size hence the entering of pet microplastics initial into biological wastewater treatment system decreased particle size of generated was which was one reason for enhanced sludge solubilization in aerobic digestion being observed in reactor experiment it was also documented previously that pha content and gram staining bacteria composition had impacts on sludge cell breakage wang et al 2013 was e and was c derived from the identical biological wastewater treatment reactors with and without pet microplastics exposure respectively fig 3b showed that the pha content in was e was 1 56 times p 0 0003 more than it was in was c this indicated that the presence of pet microplastics in the biological wastewater treatment system affected the pha content in generated was higher pha content in sludge generally makes sludge cell more fragile and easily breakage therefore the presence of pet microplastics in the biological wastewater treatment system would promote the generated was to be solubilized during aerobic digestion besides the cell walls of gram positive bacteria gpb are surrounded with thick and multilayered peptidoglycan sheath whereas cell walls of gram negative bacteria gnb are composed of thin and one layer peptidoglycan compared to gram staining bacteria composition in was c fig 3c was e had higher ratio of gnb gpb which would therefore benefit for the breakage of cell sludge fig 3d 3 3 pet microplastics with different entry paths dissimilarly suppressed was hydrolysis and degradability in aerobic digestion was hydrolysis and degradability in all cases were determined by model based analysis as summarized in fig 4 the first order kinetic model could fit the experimental data of was degradation in each reactor well with correlation coefficient r2 0 95 in all cases fig 4a and thus is considered to be valid and reliable this modelling technique enables to make outcomes more comparable and compatible was in reactor control had a hydrolysis coefficient k of 0 25 0 01 day 1 while it in reactor experiment and reactor dose significantly p 0 008 and 0 002 decreased to 0 21 0 01 and 0 19 0 01 day 1 fig 4b this indicated that the presence of pet microplastics have adverse influence on was hydrolysis during aerobic digestion and direct entry of pet microplastics caused greater inhibition than that flow from biological wastewater treatment system based on the results of model analysis and reactors tests the relative fractions of was including the degraded fraction in the reactor degradable but not degraded fraction and non degradable fraction were further analyzed the results in fig 4b showed that pet microplastics added directly and pet microplastics flowed from biological wastewater treatment system significantly decreased was degradability from 29 0 0 5 to 21 2 0 5 p 4 42e 05 and 26 9 0 6 p 0 0096 respectively specially almost all the degradable fraction of the was have been degraded in reactor control throughout the 15 day aerobic digestion as indicated by an extremely low percentage of degradable but not degraded fraction i e 0 7 0 1 in contrast pet microplastics exposure especially pet microplastics flowed from biological wastewater treatment system significantly p 0 0003 and 0 0081 increased this fraction in was and reduced stability of aerobic digestate this probably because the entering of pet microplastics to biological wastewater treatment system improved the solubilization of generated was in aerobic digestion but inhibited in reactor degradation of soluble organics 3 4 pet microplastics with different entry paths variously changed microbial community in was aerobic digester microbial sequences taxa from reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose were performed using illumina miseq sequencing technique to disclose the variations of microbial community after exposed to pet microplastics with different entry paths the microbial diversity in terms of the rarefaction curves and diversity indices were illustrated in fig 5 rarefaction curves fig 5a revealed that more effective sequences 32345 were yielded in reactor control than reactor experiment 30927 and reactor dose 25689 indicating that the presence of pet microplastics especially for direct addition reduced the total microbial populations three rarefaction curves all nearly reached plateau finally implying that sequencing data had a high quality and more sequencing reads would generate few new species schauer gimenez et al 2010 additionally high coverage estimator 0 98 0 99 values in the samples from three reactors fig 5b demonstrated that the sequencing results were sufficient for effective characterization of the microbial communities he et al 2020 meanwhile similar p 0 05 diversity estimators chao and shannon were obtained from samples with and without pet microplastics exposure suggesting that minimal effect of pet microplastics on microbial diversity taxonomic abundance scenarios of microbial samples from three aerobic reactors in fig 5c demonstrated general differences in the abundances of bacterial phyla highly dominant bacteria in three reactors comprised proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria many bacteria in these phyla were responsible the degradation of organic substrates e g proteins and polysaccharides duan et al 2019 reactor control harbored these phyla with higher abundances i e 85 6 0 5 of the total bacterial populations in contrast pet microplastics with direct addition significantly decreased p 0 0002 their populations to 81 2 0 3 and pet microplastics flowed from biological wastewater treatment system further remarkably reduced p 0 0001 the abundances of these bacterial phyla to 78 9 0 6 which could be linked to the less was degradation observed in the reactor dose and reactor experiment the population shifts of the microbial community in three reactors were further explored in terms of the top 10 abundant families fig 5d and are widely distributed throughout various aerobic habitats xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 rhodocyclaceae which was the predominant bacterial family shared in all systems in this study and have been reported to be abundant in wastewater treatment activated sludge wang et al 2012 was reduced in the presence of pet microplastics saprospiraceae and chitinophagaceae which were the second dominant family members showed a higher abundance of 8 1 0 5 and 5 3 0 5 in the reactor control saprospiraceae play the important role in the breakdown of complex organic compounds in the environment mcilroy and nielsen 2014 and their relative abundance in reactor experiment and reactor dose decreased p 0 010 and 0 002 by 20 9 0 1 and 28 4 0 1 respectively similarly the reduction of chitinophagaceae family members known as the degraders of chitin and cellulose rosenberg 2014 were observed in the presence of pet microplastics p 0 014 and 0 001 another dominant family the abundance of xanthomonadaceae which is a kind of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria lueders et al 2006 was significantly higher in reactor control 2 8 0 3 than that in reactor experiment 1 8 0 3 p 0 015 and reactor dose 1 3 0 2 p 0 002 besides nitrosomonadaceae which have been reported to have the ability of oxidizing ammonia prosser et al 2014 were detected and appeared to be less abundant in reactors with pet microplastics than without p 0 021 and 0 036 all of these variations revealed that the pet microplastics exposure changed microbial communities along the direction against was aerobic degradation and pet microplastics with direct addition had more adverse influence than those flowed from biological wastewater treatment system which was consistent with the aerobic digestion performances of was observed in the studied reactors 3 5 insights into the different mechanisms of pet microplastics with different entry paths affecting was aerobic digestion as demonstrated above the presence of pet microplastics inhibited aerobic digestion of was via the inhibition of hydrolysis and the shift of the microbial community and pet microplastics with direct addition restrained was degradation more severely compared to pet microplastics flowed from biological wastewater treatment system which raised two key questions how pet microplastics induced such suppression influences why two different entry paths of pet microplastics caused different performances the potential mechanisms of pet microplastics with different entry paths affecting was aerobic digestion were thus explored to answer these questions our previous studies found that microplastics exposure could up regulate oxidative stress toward anaerobes via inducing ros production in anaerobic environment wei et al 2019b wei et al 2019c in general microbial cells have the ability of removing generated ros by antioxidant enzymes thereby mediating oxidative stress xia et al 2008 nevertheless such antioxidant defense is restricted due to the limited amount of antioxidant enzymes the excessive ros level can destroy redox balance and activate redox sensitive signaling pathways e g the map kinases and nf kb cascades eventually resulting in cytotoxicity and even cellular apoptosis microplastics also have been found to cause toxicity toward aquatic invertebrates via induced oxidative stress jeong et al 2016 lei et al 2018 in this study ros level as the indicator of oxidative stress in reactor control reactor experiment and reactor dose were measured as seen from fig 6 a the presence of pet microplastics in aerobic system increased ros level by 49 52 compared to the control and there was no significant difference in entry paths of pet microplastics to determine the role of ros induced by pet microplastics in reducing was degradation during aerobic digestion the extra ros scavengers i e sod and cat were initially added in each reactor in the aerobic digestion test results showed that ros level in reactor experiment and reactor dose with ros scavengers dropped to the similar level with it in reactor control correspondingly the inhibition degree on was degradation was clearly alleviated especially in reactor experiment achieving up to 97 5 of the control this finding revealed that oxidative stress induced by pet microplastics might be one of key factors for inhibiting was aerobic digestion and the different entry paths of pet microplastics in aerobic digester had little impact on the level of oxidative stress induced bejgarn et al 2015 demonstrated that more than one third of microplastics i e pe ps and pet leached chemical additives potential influences of leachates from microplastics on invertebrates crustaceans anaerobe and microalgae have also been documented in recent years chen et al 2002 wei et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 many chemicals leached can induce biotoxicity within the ng l ug l range cole et al 2011 in this leaching experiment the main chemical additives i e dehp dep bbp and dmp were not detected in all reactors and only dbp was detected in reactor dose suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 also found that dbp was the prominent chemicals leached from pet microplastics however few dbp was detected in reactor experiment presumably because dbp has been released during the prolonged exposure of pet microplastics in biological wastewater treatment system the concentrations of dbp leached in reactor dose vs time were recorded in fig s2 to determine the toxic effect of dbp leached from pet microplastics reactor control ii reactor experiment ii and reactor dose ii containing aerobic digesting sludge with corresponding dbp were conducted the cell membrane integrity of aerobic digesting sludge in three reactors was evaluated in terms of ldh and dna release fig 6b compared to reactor control ii and reactor experiment ii without the dbp addition ldh showed a corresponding increase in reactor dose ii exposed to dbp an increased release of dna was also observed live and dead cells in three reactors were presented in fig 6c e to indicate cells viability of aerobic digesting sludge the presence of dbp leached from pet microplastics did increase the fractions of dead cells observed in reactor dose ii by 7 3 0 5 compared to reactor control ii and reactor experiment ii without dbp exposure this indicated that the released dbp from pet microplastics posed a serious hazard to aerobic digesting sludge resulting in cell death of aerobic digesting sludge which would be another factor for the toxicity of pet microplastics 3 6 overall understanding and implications from the study above it can be seen that pet microplastics had different toxicity influences on sludge aerobic digestion under different entry paths when pet microplastics entered into biological wastewater treatment system the subsequent sludge aerobic digestion was inhibited since the sludge solubilization increased and the hydrolysis decreased however when pet microplastics was directly added to the sludge aerobic digester there was little impact on solubilization while the hydrolysis were inhibited obviously leading to more deteriorative performance of sludge aerobic digestion pet microplastics reduced the populations of key bacteria through induced oxidative stress or and releasing toxic chemical note that this study used pet microplastic fragments but the different shapes and sizes of pet microplastics would potentially affect the leaching rate of chemicals through equilibrium partitioning therefore future efforts could be devoted to investigate the potential impacts of microplastics with different shapes e g fibre and granular size ranges 1 50000 μm and polymer compositions on was aerobic digestion overall this study provided a more accurate approach and a more to assessing the real situation regarding the influences of pet microplastics on sludge aerobic digestion although pet microplastics were used to represent the overall microplastics at environmental concentration this work can serve as a solid step towards the full understanding of the impacts of microplastics under environmental realistic conditions at the present stage if a considerable amount of microplastics enter aerobic digester a larger aerobic digester or a longer sludge retention time srt might be required for achieving the similar performance of sludge aerobic digestion as the system without microplastics exposure therefore considering the increased production and discharge of plastic products and their adverse environmental impact a more holistic manage approach may be required to reduce littering of plastics and develop alternative biodegradable materials thereby minimizing the potential impacts of microplastics on biotechnological systems in wwtp such as sludge aerobic digester additionally effective microplastics target treatment technology should be developed and applied in wastewater and waste sludge treatment before significant amount of microplastics enter into biological wastewater treatment system especially the direct entering of considerable amount of microplastics into sludge treatment system should be avoided 4 conclusions the entering of pet microplastics to biological wastewater treatment system inhibited was aerobic digestion by 10 9 0 1 compared to the control test smaller sludge particle size and increased pha content and ratio of gnb gpb in generated was contributed to the enhanced was solubilization in aerobic digestion but the oxidative stress induced by pet microplastics inhibited was hydrolysis however when pet microplastics was directly added to the sludge aerobic digester was aerobic digestion was suppressed more severely there was little impact on was solubilization but the hydrolysis were inhibited seriously through induced oxidative stress and releasing toxic chemical pet microplastics caused the shift of the microbial community toward the direction against aerobic digestion as such pet microplastics had significantly different toxicity influences on sludge aerobic digestion for different entry paths declaration of competing interest

17274,controlling disinfection by products formation while ensuring effective drinking water disinfection is important for protecting public health however understanding and predicting disinfection by product formation under a variety of conditions in drinking water distribution systems remains challenging as disinfection by product formation is a multifactorial phenomenon this study aimed to assess the application of bayesian network models to predict the concentration of trihalomethanes the dominant halogenated disinfection by product class using various water quality parameters naïve bayesian and semi naïve bayesian models were constructed from sydney and south east queensland datasets across 15 drinking water distribution systems in australia the targeted variable total trihalomethanes concentration was discretised into 3 bins 0 1 mg l 1 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 the bayesian network structures were built using water quality parameters including concentrations of individual and total trihalomethanes disinfectant species free chlorine monochloramine dichloramine total chlorine nitrogen species free ammonia total ammonia nitrate nitrite and other physical chemical parameters temperature ph dissolved organic carbon total dissolved solids conductivity and turbidity seven performance parameters including predictive accuracy and the rates of true and false positive and negative results were used to assess the accuracy and precision of the bayesian network models after evaluating the model performance the optimum models were selected to be bayesian network augmented naïve models these were observed to have the highest predictive accuracies for sydney 78 and south east queensland 94 although disinfectant residuals are among the key variables that lead to trihalomethanes formation potential concentrations of trihalomethanes in distribution systems can be more confidently predicted in terms of probability associated with a wider range of water quality variables using bayesian networks the modelling procedure developed in this work can now be applied to develop system specific bayesian network models for trihalomethanes prediction in other

2003 although most dbp formation is associated with disinfection processes at wtps additional dbps may also be produced during water transmission in dwdss epidemiological studies have indicated that long term exposure to dbps is associated with increased adverse health outcomes including bladder cancer villanueva et al 2004 although over 700 dbps have been identified and more previously unidentified dbps are continuing to emerge only a few selected groups are monitored routinely by water utilities li and mitch 2018 richardson and kimura 2020 most prominently monitored are trihalomethanes thms followed by haloacetic acids li and mitch 2018 thms are known to be the dominant class by mass of halogenated cl br and i dbps in drinking water which are formed by reactions between chlorine and natural organic matter such as humic or fulvic acids crittenden et al 2012 krasner et al 2006 the presence of bromide or iodide ions in the water leads to brominated or iodinated thms respectively xie 2003 four common thm species chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform collectively known as thm4 have been subjected to regulation in the us since 1979 li and mitch 2018 the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality have set guideline values for individual thm4 in drinking water for chloroform 0 3 mg l 1 bromodichloromethane 0 06 mg l 1 dibromochloromethane 0 1 mg l 1 and bromoform 0 1 mg l 1 who 2017 the australian drinking water guidelines adwg has recommended a similar guideline concentration for thms but based on the sum of these four thms which should not exceed 0 25 mg l 1 nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 finding a balance between disinfection efficiency and dbp formation in drinking water remains a challenge for water utilities to minimise thm formation during distribution monochloramine a weaker but more stable disinfectant than free chlorine has been applied as a secondary disinfectant in dwdss richardson and postigo 2015 understanding and predicting dbp formation under a variety of conditions in dwdss is challenging since dbp formation is known to be a multifactorial phenomenon in addition to halogen ions and natural organic matter dbp formation can be influenced by other water quality and operational parameters in dwdss including temperature ph water age turbidity and the concentrations of disinfectant residual and nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and sulphur li et al 2019 many studies have reported on the development of numerical predictive models and multivariate analysis of influencing factors for thms formation brown et al 2011 chen and westerhoff 2010 le roux et al 2012 obolensky and singer 2008 although some regression models have achieved satisfactory prediction on dbps formation with strong correlations to the selected predictors golea et al 2017 these traditional regression models may not be the best approach to capture the complex interrelationships between water quality operational factors and dbps formation having examined this problem in detail we have previously developed the concept of applying bayesian networks as an alternative to facilitate multifactorial modelling and prediction of dbp formation in dwdss li et al 2019 the advantages of bayesian networks in comparison to regression models are described below bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models which can be used to describe causal relationships between model variables marcot 2012 a bayesian network structure consists of nodes representing variables and arcs representing directional connections norsys 2017 an arc starts from a variable which is referred to as a parent node and ends at another variable which is called a child node showing their causal dependencies each node is conditionally independent unless they are linked by arcs holmes and jain 2008 the target variable to be predicted or classified is called a class node if it is not a child node of any other variables which are also called attributes in most bayesian network software continuous variables need to be discretised into a finite set of states chen and pollino 2012 a conditional probability table cpt attached to each node shows the quantified causal relationship between nodes the size of the cpt of a child node grows when the number of its parents and their states increase which increases the complexity associated with populating the cpt chen and pollino 2012 bayesian networks can incorporate parameter uncertainty and variability carvajal et al 2017 based on other given observed data or conditional probability information bayesian networks can also calculate the conditional probabilities of missing states when there are random missing variables holmes and jain 2008 the predictive values are presented as numerical values from regression models whereas in bayesian networks they are presented in terms of probabilities in a range of values e g 90 0 1 mg l 1 9 in 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 and 1 0 2 mg l 1 while many researchers have used traditional regression numerical models to seek the relationship between known influencing variable and thm formation bayesian network is able to capture the subtle interrelationships between variables struhl 2017 when individual parameters are changed in response to observations or what if scenarios the full chain of influence can be observed from a bayesian network in which the interrelationships among predictive variables can be determined similarly bayesian networks facilitate backcasting which enables users to determine the most likely system conditions required to achieve a specified outcome i e thm4 being below guideline values however these can be challenging to achieve in linear regression models which require known data inputs i e all required water parameters in the function to generate a target output i e thm4 concentration especially when there are missing data in the predictive variables of the function thus bayesian network modelling has been shown to offer greater functionality than regression when determining the effects of many variables on an outcome struhl 2017 therefore dbp formation under various conditions can be predicted more realistically in bayesian networks with new conditional probabilities based on bayes theorem developed in the 18th century bayesian networks have been progressively used to determine conditional relationships among variables both attributes and target variables in water quality studies especially in the field of chemical and microbial risk assessment carvajal et al 2015 2017 graham et al 2019 islam et al 2016 zerouali and zerouali 2020 zhu et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 there are only a limited number of thms studies applying bayesian networks among which a dynamic bayesian network zhu et al 2010 and a bayesian belief network bbn zhu et al 2014 have been successfully developed for predicting thm formation and associated health risks in drinking water with the source water quality at wtps as it is a cross discipline technique no predictive model on dbp formation using bayesian networks with water quality parameters in dwdss has been reported to our knowledge in this study predictive bayesian network models were developed to understand and predict the formation of four individual thms and the composite thm4 in australian chloraminated dwdss it was hypothesised that routinely collected parameters could provide a strong predictive capability for thm formation following the model development and optimisation procedures unlike the laboratory controlled studies routinely collected water quality parameters might not have significant variances in treated drinking water and often data for certain known influencing factors such as bromide concentration are unavailable in this work we demonstrate that a bayesian network approach is particularly useful to determine the interrelationships among influencing factors relevant to those specific systems via backcasting and conditional scenario studies water quality data routinely collected by water utilities can be investigated to identify useful predictive relationship in bayesian network applications 2 material and methods a procedure for bayesian network modelling from the approach previously proposed by carvajal et al 2015 with minor modifications was used this procedure incorporated the key steps of data collection and formatting structure development performance evaluation model comparison and selection and model exportation and prediction the focus of this study was to predict the formation of thm4 using other water quality variables correlations of formation between the individual thm4 were also investigated bayesian networks were constructed and evaluated using the waikato environment for knowledge analysis weka v 3 8 4 data mining software the university of waikato new zealand following the modelling procedure displayed in figure a 1 supplementary material netica norsys software corp 2020 a bayesian network software was used to visualise the graphical models developed in weka and undertake case study investigations matlab r2020a was also used in conjunction with weka for preliminary data processing matlab codes are available in the supplementary material section b 2 1 data collection and formatting water quality data were collected from chloraminated dwdss in sydney sydney water nsw january 2010 december 2017 and south east queensland seqwater qld july 2016 august 2019 sydney is serviced by nine separate wtps with 12 associated dwdss cascade illawarra macarthur nepean north richmond orchard hills potts hill prospect east north and south ryde warragamba and woronora systems providing drinking water to about 5 million people there are four dwdss selected from south east queensland brisbane logan southern pipeline and northern pipeline dwdss these systems are supplied from the mount crosby wtps and the north pine wtp together serving nearly 3 million people figure c 1 supplementary material source water in both regions is disinfected with free chlorine as the primary disinfectant at the wtps and then distributed where monochloramine is used as the secondary disinfectant while not all sydney water dwdss routinely practice chloramination only data from chloraminated distribution systems were used in this analysis these two regions have significant differences in their source water quality that should impact thm formation and speciation south east queensland has warmer temperatures and higher bromide concentrations 0 1 0 3 mg l 1 in dwdss in its source water whereas bromide ion is not a significant issue in sydney 0 1 mg l 1 the sample collection period the number of raw and valid data points and selected water quality parameters for bayesian network modelling are listed in table 1 a total of 4742 data points containing thm concentrations were considered valid for bayesian network modelling water quality data listed in table 1 were organised in microsoft excel with each case as a single row in chronological order and with potential influencing factors as columns the raw data were first processed in matlab for visualisation of data distribution concentrations of thm4 and other water quality parameters were plotted in histograms in matlab to give a visual understanding of bin discretisation and the variability of dwdss data from sydney and south east queensland the concentration of thm4 was set to be the class node each water quality variable was processed as an attribute regardless of some variables known to have direct correlations such as conductivity and total dissolved solids tds and total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc this is because interrelationships between variables can be determined in bayesian networks the variables with continuous data needed to be discretised before being used in a bayesian network discretisation of thm4 concentration was conducted manually based on the modeller s judgement in matlab an optimum number of bins for thm4 concentration was determined to be three with discretisation such as 0 1 mg l 1 low 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 moderate and 0 2 mg l 1 high the discretised dataset was saved as a csv file and imported to weka using its inbuilt machine learning algorithm for data mining processes the missing numerical values in the dataset were imputed and replaced using expectation maximisation em with emimputation filter under preprocess tab in weka em is an iterative method to find the maximum likelihood parameters of a statistical model using the estimated sufficient statistics of the known data observations dempster et al 1977 missing temperature values were replaced within each season instead of the whole dataset as a more realistic representation was obtained when the missing value replacement was conducted within each group that had the same pattern the dataset with missing values filled was saved as an arff file for structure development 2 2 structure development a bayesian belief network is a directed acyclic graph which can model non recursive causal relationships in complex systems bbn models can be naïve bayesian nb and semi naïve bayesian snb models a nb model has the target variable as the only parent node with all other independent attributes as its child nodes whereas a snb model is a derivative naïve bayesian model with the target variable as the class node and attributes can have causal relationships with one another mccallum and nigam 1998 there are two examples for snb including the tree augmented naïve tan model where each child node has a causal relationship with maximal two variables and the bayesian network augmented naïve ban model where two or more arcs are allowed between attributes carvajal et al 2015 while a general bbn generates a large conditional probability distribution for the target variable nb and snb give much simpler probabilistic model structures since the parentless target variable only requires marginal probabilities mccallum and nigam 1998 variables listed in table 1 were selected as attribute nodes the initial bbn conceptual model was built in netica based on a proposed model of thms formation developed and described as an outcome of a comprehensive literature review li et al 2019 all influencing factors were the parents to the thm4 concentration however this initial model contained many parent nodes resulting in an excessively large cpt for thm4 concentration to keep the size of the cpt manageable the bayesian network was reconstructed to a simpler probabilistic nb or snb model in weka using its automated structure learning tool which was able to define the optimal number of arcs and the states of nodes in the network three bayesian models one nb one tan and one ban were constructed for each of the two water supply regions to predict the thm4 concentration in dwdss the em filled datasets arff files generated in section 2 1 for each region were loaded respectively in the preprocess function for structure modelling all variables were considered as attribute nodes for the model the network structures were auto learned using bayesnet as the classifier under the classify function in weka explorer using the same searching algorithm and quality measure the number of parents for each node was defined to be one for nb and two for tan according to their definition and not more than three for ban to simplify the process of populating the cpts for child nodes as marcot et al 2006 recommended akaike information criterion score an information theoretic scoring function containing likelihood was selected as the score type to judge the quality of a network structure since it is known to provide a trade off between the model s goodness of fit and its simplicity kjaerulff and madsen 2008 the heuristic search algorithm k2 hill climbing was chosen to construct the networks section d 1 supplementary material details of other searching algorithms available in weka can be found in bouckaert 2008 conventional understandings of causal relationships were also applied to further improve the causal relationship and simplicity of the network structure for example attribute nodes linked to thm4 concentration without various data points i e single state nodes and any child node were removed the number of bins for each predictive attribute were determined by machine learning in weka with the aim of achieving the best representative discretisation with consideration of the relationships among attributes in the model due to the data variabilities between the datasets of sydney and south east queensland the classifications of bins may be different for each attribute in these two models as mentioned in the previous section the number of states of the class node was adjusted to improve the prediction accuracy and the discretisation thresholds were edited manually to better represent relevant concentration thresholds 2 3 model performance evaluation and comparison the evaluation and comparison of multiple models were conducted in weka experimenter using the em filled datasets generated as described in section 2 1 with the same algorithms described in section 2 2 bayesian network models built from the discretised datasets were compared with zeror as the baseline model for each region zeror model represents a network without arcs which always predicts the most likely state of a nominal node and the mean for a numeric node carvajal et al 2015 for each dataset three bayesian network structures were learned including one nb one tan and one ban the performances of all bayesian network models were compared k fold cross validation was chosen to assess the predictive performance of models in this study as it is known to be an unbiased approach for model evaluation bengio and grandvalet 2004 k fold cross validation followed the procedure previously described by boyce et al 2002 section d 2 supplementary material in this study k was taken as 10 so each fold contained around 352 cases for sydney and 121 cases for south east queensland the model performance was evaluated with seven performance parameters these parameters included predictive accuracy kappa statistic area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc true positive rate tpr false positive rate fpr true negative rate tnr and false negative rate fnr these parameters were compared among the three bayesian networks models nb tan ban against the baseline model zeror the one with the best performance was selected for each region standard deviations of each of the parameters were calculated from the results of 10 fold cross validation to assess the variation in the randomised data matrix in weka 2 4 model exportation and prediction the bayesian network model was visualised with states and links of variables in visual graph in weka the best model for each region was selected and exported from weka as a xml model and then imported into netica for prediction study attribute nodes linked to thm4 concentrations with only a single state were removed and the net was compiled a one way sensitivity analysis was done in netica using the function sensitivity to finding to determine the influence of each variable to the target variable thm4 concentration if a variable has a higher variance reduction value the randomness of thm4 concentration is reduced at that variable which means that the variable has higher influence on thm4 concentration as we used the predictive application of bayesian network to predict thm4 concentration the state of thm4 concentration was specified to a certain condition the performance of other variables under such conditional thm4 concentration was presented in terms of probability using the graphical bayesian network nodes the behaviour of thm4 concentration concerning water quality variables was reported and evaluated 2 5 trihalomethane speciation correlations the relationships among thm4 and its individual species in dwdss were studied from the exported bayesian models in netica for each region they were used to predict the concentration of each species under the specified conditions states of thm4 concentration correlations among chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform were investigated by observing changes in predicted concentrations of each species with the set conditions for one thm species in addition correlations of thm speciation were presented graphically by plotting the concentrations of four thm species in scatter diagrams in matlab 3 results and discussion sydney and south east queensland regions represent two types of chloraminated dwdss in which various recorded water quality parameters were observed variations in thm concentrations and speciation were anticipated between the two regions especially at the end of pipes sydney and south east queensland are discussed individually and in comparison with each other in the following subsections 3 1 variability of water quality data the distributions of water qualities in chloraminated dwdss are presented in histograms for sydney fig 1 and south east queensland fig 2 from their respective raw datasets before em imputation there were 21 variables reported including the individual and sum concentrations of thm4 µg l 1 free chlorine mg cl2 l 1 monochloramine mg cl2 l 1 dichloramine mg cl2 l 1 total chlorine mg cl2 l 1 free ammonia mg n l 1 total ammonia mg n l 1 nitrate mg n l 1 nitrite mg n l 1 doc mg l 1 toc mg l 1 ph temperature c tds mg l 1 turbidity ntu colour hazen unit and conductivity µs cm 1 due to the geographical differences between the two regions typically warmer water temperatures were observed in south east queensland with an average of 23 c which is about 8 c higher than the sydney average low to nil free chlorine concentrations were reported in south east queensland dwdss while higher free chlorine concentrations were found in sydney dwdss approximately 21 of sydney dwds free chlorine values exceeded 0 5 mg cl2 l 1 in contrast the mean monochloramine concentration in south east queensland was 3 times higher than that for sydney water ph typically ranged from 7 5 8 in both regions but sydney tended to have a slightly higher average of ph 7 9 compared to the average in south east queensland of ph 7 6 these variations might be due to the differences in source water and operational practices and the distance between sampling points and disinfection facilities for example since the sydney dwdss have a significant amount of cement lined pipework ph at the extremities is sometimes in the range of 8 8 3 occasionally higher ph 8 5 was observed at sydney sampling points closer to wtps where the ph in some systems may be uncontrolled before the first reservoir these sampling locations usually have low to nil free chlorine and a higher concentration of monochloramine compared to those at the more distant ends of the dwds this observation suggested that monochloramine decayed during distribution and as remediation for disinfectant loss breakpoint rechlorination was applied some variables in the collected datasets were only available for south east queensland as shown in table 1 low to nil concentrations of free ammonia and nitrite were observed in the selected south east queensland dwdss with more than 70 frequency of nitrate less than 0 1 mg n l 1 the combinations of only minor observed decay of monochloramine and ammonia along with minor observed increases in nitrate concentration suggest the occurrence of nil or only mild nitrification conditions however under some infrequent conditions nitrate concentration was observed to rise above 0 4 mg n l 1 with co occurring very low concentrations in both monochloramine 0 2 mg cl2 l 1 and ammonia 0 1 mg n l 1 indicating occasional more nitrification doc and toc were generally reported at 3 5 mg l 1 indicating a combination of good source water quality and pre treatment performance as many water utilities strive to achieve turbidity and true colour were below 0 5 ntu and 1 hazen unit respectively these additional water quality variables provided more predictors for the thms bayesian network models the concentrations of thm4 in both regions were mostly below guideline values 0 25 mg l 1 recommended by adwg except for a few outliers 0 2 which were up to 0 3 mg l 1 due to differences in source water quality especially bromide concentrations and operational conditions mentioned previously much higher concentrations of br thms were found in south east queensland compared to sydney for instance the average concentration of bromoform in south east queensland was around 10 µg l 1 with a maximum of 40 µg l 1 whereas 97 of the sydney bromoform results were less than the analytical limit of detection 0 5 µg l 1 with only 3 in the 0 5 6 µg l 1 range to determine the dominant species and correlations of individual thm4 in dwdss the concentrations of chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform of both regions were also plotted in scatter diagrams figure e 1 supplementary material the concentration of chloroform was found to have a negative relationship with the concentrations of dibromochloromethane and bromoform for example in low bromide systems sydney chloroform was observed to be the dominant thm species with an insignificant level of bromoform in contrast br thms concentrations were observed to be abundant in south east queensland as anticipated bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane were the most abundant species when chloroform concentration was low an important factor in producing this outcome is expected to be higher bromide concentrations in south east queensland source water but other potential operational differences may also play a role these include the concentrations of free chlorine and monochloramine which may lead to variable cl br ratios this speciation shifting is consistent with previous reports indicating that the presence of bromide can shift speciation of cl thms to br thms langsa et al 2017 saidan et al 2016 xia et al 2017 zhu et al 2014 the correlations of individual thm4 may help to determine the influence of individual thm species on thm4 in the predictive models which will be discussed in section 3 5 3 2 structures of the optimum bayesian networks the final nodes and states of the selected bayesian network models for thm formations across sydney and south east queensland dwdss are presented in fig 3 the models are based on temporal averages over 8 year records across 12 sydney dwdss and 5 year records across 4 south east queensland dwdss both networks were ban models having thm4 concentration as class nodes which were manually discretised into three bins with thresholds of 0 1 mg l 1 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 all nodes were shown as discrete in weka when exported and were converted back to continuous with discretised states in netica for prediction study the probability of each state of the variable from the training dataset is presented near to the states in each node at the bottom of each continuous node mean values standard deviations calculated from the probabilities of the node states are presented the concentrations of individual thm species were excluded for the optimum predictive models as they were designed to predict thm4 concentration with water quality parameters networks included individual thm species were discussed in section 3 5 the previous study indicated that temperature is among the influencing parameters for dbps formation li et al 2019 however temperature was found to be a single state node in the sydney dwdss bayesian network indicating little correlation between temperature and thm4 concentrations compared to other attributes hence with temperature removed from the predictors there were six attributes in the sydney bayesian network model ph turbidity and chlorine species free chlorine monochloramine dichloramine and total chlorine the attributes of chlorine species were connected by arcs indicating they had interconnections to each other meanwhile as ph was connected to one of the chlorine species nodes the change in ph could result in the chlorine speciation shifting which is consistent with current understandings deborde and von gunten 2008 kinani et al 2012 vikesland et al 2001 there were an additional eight attributes identified as predictors in the south east queensland network model chlorate free and total ammonia nitrate nitrite conductivity tds and doc based on the generated bayesian networks in netica true colour was not considered to be a predictor as it was found to have a negligible impact on the thm4 concentration toc and turbidity are known to be important influencing factors to disinfectant demand leading to thm4 formation power and nagy 1999 ramavandi et al 2015 however toc and turbidity did not vary much in the south east queensland treated water indicating their low predictive capabilities to thm4 concentration compared to other predictors hence toc and turbidity were removed for the optimum ban model achieving an improvement in predictive capability the sampling time linked to the variance in seasonal water quality and daily consumption demands and locations such as at main pipes dead end or near reservoir are known to significantly affect thm formation and other water quality li et al 2019 however these data are not available in the current dataset provided in this study hence the bayesian networks were designed to assess the relationships among those available water quality parameters on an averaged temporal and special basis the model predictability could be further improved by a more refined assessment of temporal and spatial parameters in a future study the development of the bayesian network structure is a challenging task which requires a good understanding of the causal relationships and continuous learning for refinement as an alternative to manual discretisation based on the modeller s judgement discretisation can be undertaken automatically using machine learning however as others have previously observed automatic discretisation may lead to discretisation thresholds which lack relevance or physical meaning chen and pollino 2012 the automatic discretisation thresholds of the target variable thm4 concentration may vary between datasets which may not always be ideal for model comparison or interpretation furthermore the number of discretisation bins affects the performance of the model for example when the number of bins for the models presented here was reduced the accuracy of prediction increased but the predictive results became less relevant based on factors such as their relationship with drinking water guideline thresholds in contrast when the number of bins increased more conditional relationship details were shown with a larger size cpt which increased model complexity and model quantification the performances of models with variable numbers of bins for target variable thm4 concentration discretised manually using matlab and by automatic discretisation via machine learning in weka were compared in the supplementary material section f the number of bins for other attributes however were optimised by machine learning achieving the highest predictive capability of the models 3 3 performance evaluation of bayesian network models seven performance parameters of bayesian network models are displayed in table 2 predictive accuracy was calculated by dividing the number of correctly predicted cases by the total number of cases when the measured thm4 concentration e g 0 095 mg l 1 falls within the predicted range 0 1 mg l 1 it is assumed that the model prediction is correct kappa statistic shows the agreement between model predictions and actual data values with a range of 1 to 1 in which agreement is positively correlated to the kappa statistic value marcot 2012 auc ranging 0 1 shows the capability of a model to distinguish between classes that higher auc indicating better prediction korb and nicholson 2010 tpr refers to the rate of correct positive result prediction whereas fpr type i error refers to the probability that negative result is incorrectly classified to be the positive result setting thm4 0 1 mg l 1 as the positive result as an example tpr is the probability of the predicted thm4 concentrations are classified as low range whereas fpr is the rate that thm4 at moderate and high ranges are predicted as the low range tnr and fnr type ii error are referred to the probability of correct negative result prediction and the probability of positive results being incorrectly predicted respectively these results were generated in weka by calculating the mean values and standard deviation from the 10 fold cross validation procedure the results of sensitivity analysis are available in section h supplementary material the performance measures were derived for three bayesian network model structures one nb one tan and one ban of each region which were each constructed without the concentrations of individual thm species as predictors based on the model performance the optimum network structure was chosen to be ban for both sydney and south east queensland dwdss in addition the performance of the further optimised ban model in which toc and turbidity were excluded as shown in fig 3 for south east queensland was included in table 2 bayesian network models constructed for the sydney dwdss were found to have fair confidence to predict thm4 concentrations with the predictive accuracies ranging 73 78 and aucs around 0 8 these models were found to correctly predict the range of thm4 concentrations very well tpr 89 94 however type i errors of all models were found to be very high fpr 50 indicating a high probability for the models to incorrectly classify high concentration results 0 1 mg l 1 as lower predicted thm4 concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 in addition the kappa statistic was found to be about 0 3 showing that these models had only a fair agreement to the thm4 concentration therefore the overall performance of the bayesian models for sydney dwdss indicated that the predicted thm4 concentrations may not reliably reflect the measured concentrations this error may be due to the limited available water quality variables as predictors for sydney dwdss findings from the sensitivity analysis include that ph turbidity and chlorine species had low variances of beliefs 0 8 12 to thm4 concentration with the additional eight water quality variables being predictors for thm4 concentration the predictive accuracies of all south east queensland bayesian networks were found to be at least 91 implying that more cases were correctly predicted by the models a strong agreement between model predictions and actual data values was observed with the kappa statistic above 0 75 and auc above 0 96 compared to the sydney models the south east queensland models had slightly higher tpr of 97 and a much lower type i errors fpr 20 thus the south east queensland bayesian network models have better performance to predict the thm4 concentrations to a correct range this may be the result of almost all variables having at least 12 variance of beliefs to thm4 concentration which indicated their non negligible influence however considering more water quality parameters in the model construction is not the only factor to improve the model predictive capability data with more variance can be more influential to the target variable bringing an improvement in the predictability of the model for example using the same variables as predictors as sydney models the predictive accuracies of south east queensland bayesian networks reduced to 88 90 which were still at least 10 higher than the sydney models this difference may be the result of chlorine species in south east queensland dwdss having 15 37 variance of beliefs to thm4 concentration which were more influential than those in sydney dwdss 12 the various correlation could be because the sydney records were collected from 12 associated dwdss served by nine separate wtps while there were only four dwdss supplied by two wtps selected from south east queensland if so this would suggest that it is more difficult to develop an accurate universal model than a system specific one comparing the performance of these bayesian network models ban was found to be the best model having the highest predictive accuracy for sydney 78 and south east queensland 94 type ii error rates were insignificant in all models therefore two ban models were selected to predict thm4 concentrations in both regions although the optimum sydney model was found to have 94 confidence to predict thm4 at low concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 it failed to reliably predict thm4 concentrations at a higher range the optimum south east queensland model also found it challenging to predict high thm4 concentration 0 2 mg l 1 even though its tprs for low 0 1 mg l 1 and moderate 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 concentrations were 97 and 80 this is due to the limited cases at high concentration in the recorded datasets for both regions hence to improve the predictive performance for the models it is necessary to train the model with more cases at high thm4 concentrations 3 4 estimation of trihalomethanes concentration as the high predictive accuracy of bayesian network models occurred at only low thm4 concentration for sydney and low to moderate ranges of thm4 concentration for south east queensland the occurrence of thm4 concentration in these target ranges were predicted the thm4 concentrations were predicted in terms of probability of its states by setting conditions of each variable in the order of its variance of belief to the predicted variable the results of conditional scenarios are discussed as follows and depicted in figures g 1 and g 2 supplementary material the interrelationships among attributes can be observed in the bayesian networks as the change in an individual variable also affects the probabilities of the states of target variable as well as other attributes the relationship between predicted vs actual thms is presented in the confusion matrices presented in section f 3 supplementary material according to the sydney model when monochloramine is the dominant chlorine species in chloraminated dwdss with its concentrations above 0 21 mg cl2 l 1 the concentrations of free chlorine which could be the product of the self decay of monochloramine were mostly 96 below 0 025 mg cl2 l 1 under such condition the predictivethm4 concentrations were observed to be 78 97 at the low range 0 1 mg l 1 in contrast the probability of thm4 concentration at low range dropped to about 30 70 under the conditions of low monochloramine 0 21 mg cl2 l 1 and elevated free chlorine 0 025 mg cl2 l 1 concentrations regardless of the conditions of turbidity and ph the result indicated that high thms formation was associated with high free chlorine concentration which could be a result of monochloramine loss or rechlorination however since the presence of pathogenic microorganisms has greater risks to human health applying breakpoint rechlorination was necessary as remediation for significant monochloramine loss during water delivery as mentioned in section 3 1 therefore managing monochloramine decay may be among the approaches to control thms formation in sydney dwdss under the current source water quality similar to the sydney model thm4 concentrations of south east queensland dwdss were predicted to be 98 at the low range 0 1 mg l 1 and 1 9 at the moderate range 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 under the conditions of high monochloramine 0 95 mg cl2 l 1 and low free chlorine 0 06 mg cl2 l 1 concentrations the probabilities of thm4 concentration were estimated under the conditional states of other water quality parameters the predicted probability of thm4 concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 was found to be 99 9 under the conditions of ph ranging 7 5 8 3 and low levels of conductivity 474 µs cm 1 tds 252 mg l 1 and doc 3 6 mg l 1 especially at a temperature below 23 c however the probability of moderate thm4 concentration increased to 45 when the new conditions of temperature 23 c and ph 7 5 were applied on the previous setting the increase in temperature and decrease in ph was also found to elevate the mean concentration of free ammonia from 0 08 to 0 17 mg n l 1 and reduce the mean concentration of monochloramine from 2 3 to 0 79 mg cl2 l 1 this result demonstrated that warmer seasons and low ph promoted monochloramine decay which simultaneously affected thm4 concentration in addition if the tds and or doc concentrations increased under such conditions the thm4 concentrations were predicted to have higher probabilities at the moderate range 60 80 when it was in cooler seasons 23 1 c however the increase in concentrations of tds and doc was observed to decrease the probability of low range thm4 concentration to 72 with about 25 chance of thm4 in the moderate level these observations indicated that doc is among the important influencing factors for thm4 formation however the concentrations of doc from the treated water were highly stable in the selected dataset thus it does not provide strong predictive capability for thm4 concentration only 4 variance of beliefs hence it may be an effective thm control measure to reduce the concentrations of doc and tds before disinfection and to maintain the drinking water at a higher ph range of 7 5 8 3 to mitigate monochloramine decay especially during warmer seasons 3 5 evaluation of individual trihalomethane species in australia drinking water guideline values are not defined for individual thm species but only for composite thm4 however separate guideline values for each compound have been recommended by the who 2017 the bromodichloromethane concentrations on some occasions were found to exceed the who guideline value of 0 06 mg l 1 but the thm4 concentrations were found to be 0 18 0 23 mg l 1 which is below the adwg guideline value of 0 25 mg l 1 in addition br thms have been found more toxic than chloroform richardson et al 2007 any water utility that wants to understand toxicity associated with dbps needs to carefully consider the specific composition of dbps and their relative toxicity potency for example bromodichloromethane has been reported to have higher genotoxicity than chloroform and high concentrations of bromoform have been linked to an increased risk of rectal cancer richardson et al 2007 thus when developing control measures for dbps it may be more appropriate to consider each thm concentration individually instead of just the sum concentration of thm4 to evaluate the importance of the influence of individual thm species to the predictive models bayesian network models with individual thm concentrations were developed to compare with those excluding them as attribute nodes the optimum network structures are presented in fig 4 the performance parameters are presented in the supplementary material table f 1 table f 2 3 5 1 performance evaluation of bayesian networks with individual thm4 as attributes models with individual thm4 for sydney were found to have predictive accuracies of at least 90 and kappa statistic raised from 0 3 to above 0 8 indicating that the models exhibited very high agreement with measured data this is the result of chloroform and bromodichloromethane which were reported to be the dominant thm species in sydney dwdss in the sensitivity analysis chloroform was found to contribute the most influence on thm4 concentration with 81 variance of beliefs followed by bromodichloromethane 35 the other water quality variables in the sydney model were found to have lesser influence 12 variance of beliefs on thm4 concentration when chloroform and bromodichloromethane were considered as the only thm species 83 of the thm4 concentrations records were found to have less than 10 errors while only 2 of the records had 20 35 errors this implies that thm4 concentrations in sydney dwdss could potentially be derived from the measured concentrations of just two thm species chloroform and bromodichloromethane in contrast including individual thm concentrations did not have significant impacts on the performance of the south east queensland models which had their predictive accuracy raised only from 94 to 98 this is because there are 14 other important predictors besides the concentrations of individual thm4 at least 5 of these additional predictors have moderate influences on the thm4 concentration with 20 38 variance of beliefs while the rest have at least 8 impacts although the influence of individual thm concentrations is significant on the thm4 concentration they have little impact on the bayesian network models when there are more other highly influencing predictors hence other water quality variables besides individual thm4 should be considered to predict the thm4 concentrations in south east queensland dwdss 3 5 2 influence of water quality variables on thm speciation the relationships between water quality variables and individual thms can be derived from the bayesian models under specified scenarios these scenarios described here are presented in figure g 3 supplementary material as a full chain of influence can be observed from the network rather than just the targeted output like linear regression models the concentrations of individual thm species as well as other non conditional parameters can be predicted from the commonly measured water quality parameters of specified conditions even though they are not the targeted output thm4 in the model bromide is well understood to be an important factor in the production of thms however many water utilities do not routinely collect bromide concentration data in source water since bromide itself is usually not directly regulated thus this parameter is often not readily available for inclusion in bayesian network models instead accumulated water quality datasets tend to be focused on regulated parameters such as individual thms nonetheless bayesian network development may assist in identifying whether any other of the collected parameters may effectively provide a surrogate indication of bromide presence according to the south east queensland bayesian network model fig 4 b an increase in conductivity from 473 µs cm 1 to 575 µs cm 1 and tds from 251 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 at ph above 7 5 was found to decrease the probability of bromoform 10 µg l 1 from 91 to only 14 dibromochloromethane 32 µg l 1 from 97 to 35 and bromodichloromethane 28 µg l 1 from 92 to 56 compared to br thms this change was found to have a much less impact on chloroform that the probability of chloroform 28 µg l 1 reduced by 15 this observation indicates that the concentrations of br thms especially those with higher bromine content have a positive relationship with conductivity and tds similar result was observed when conductivity and tds elevated at ph 7 5 however the thm speciation was not shifted as much as it was at a higher ph for example under the condition of higher conductivity and tds higher probabilities of chloroform 28 µg l 1 and bromoform 10 µg l 1 were observed at ph 7 5 compared to a higher ph the reason for this observation was evaluated from the interrelationship between variables drawn from the bayesian network it was observed from the network that low ph was often associated with free chlorine being the most likely dominant disinfectant whereas monochloramine was the dominant disinfectant at high ph as conductivity and tds were shown to have a positive relationship with bromide concentration high cl br ratio was expected in the water with high conductivity and tds when free chlorine concentration was high low ph thus lower concentrations of br thms were expected to form under such conditions in contrast low cl br ratio resulted in high br thms concentration these findings are consistent with previous reported observations sathasivan et al 2020 the model which included individual thm species shows that lower conductivity and tds may provide useful surrogate indicators of lower concentrations of bromide ions in the water which was led to the low concentration of br thms this finding also indicates that br thms could be effectively reduced by reducing tds however removing bromide or dissolved solids from the source water may be challenging in practice as it requires advanced treatment such as reverse osmosis membrane filtration nonetheless higher doc concentrations 3 5 mg l 1 were also found to be associated with a lower probability of bromoform 10 µg l 1 hence an alternative measure to minimise bromoform formation at the same tds and conductivity levels could be to target high ph and low doc concentration while maintaining a high cl br ratio 4 conclusion bayesian network models for thm4 formation in dwdss can be produced by following the procedures of model development and optimisation relying on the existing utility water quality data potential thms concentrations in dwdss can be confidently predicted in bayesian network in terms of probability using the concentrations of disinfectant residuals nitrogen species ph tds doc conductivity and other water quality parameters but in much less confidence with only disinfectant residuals and ph alone in this study naïve and semi naïve bayesian network models were constructed and assessed for predicting thms in sydney and south east queensland dwdss ban models were selected to be the optimum predictive models in weka with manual discretisation based on the modeller s judgement for both regions although disinfectant residuals are among the key parameters that lead to thms formation the comparison of the ban models between two regions shows that the additional variables such as ph nitrogen species tds and conductivity are also important in influencing thms concentration in dwdss therefore it is important to understand the overall water chemistry leading to thms formation instead of limiting to a few parameters when developing predictive models for dbps key findings from this study are monochloramine has a negative correlation to thms formation indicating the gradual decay of monochloramine leads to the consequential formation of thms in dwdss high free chlorine concentration is associated with high thms formation especially cl thms which likely reflects the redosing of free chlorine within the distribution system after significant monochloramine decay managing monochloramine decay may be an effective strategy to control thm formation which may be achieved by maintaining a higher ph range consistent with current understanding low concentrations of doc and tds lead to reduced thm formation in dwdss thus thm formation may be managed by minimising doc and tds in the dwdss especially during warmer seasons applying higher ph is an alternative to reduce thm formation when low concentrations of tds is hard to achieve however high ph associates with low free chlorine concentration which increases the likelihood of higher br thms formation in water with high bromide concentration due to lower cl br ratios lower conductivity and tds are associated with minimising the formation of bromoform indicating that they are a reasonable surrogate measure for bromide ions although the thm prediction models are system specific the development of a bayesian network modelling framework for thms concentration presented in this work can be applied generally to other dwdss declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17274,controlling disinfection by products formation while ensuring effective drinking water disinfection is important for protecting public health however understanding and predicting disinfection by product formation under a variety of conditions in drinking water distribution systems remains challenging as disinfection by product formation is a multifactorial phenomenon this study aimed to assess the application of bayesian network models to predict the concentration of trihalomethanes the dominant halogenated disinfection by product class using various water quality parameters naïve bayesian and semi naïve bayesian models were constructed from sydney and south east queensland datasets across 15 drinking water distribution systems in australia the targeted variable total trihalomethanes concentration was discretised into 3 bins 0 1 mg l 1 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 the bayesian network structures were built using water quality parameters including concentrations of individual and total trihalomethanes disinfectant species free chlorine monochloramine dichloramine total chlorine nitrogen species free ammonia total ammonia nitrate nitrite and other physical chemical parameters temperature ph dissolved organic carbon total dissolved solids conductivity and turbidity seven performance parameters including predictive accuracy and the rates of true and false positive and negative results were used to assess the accuracy and precision of the bayesian network models after evaluating the model performance the optimum models were selected to be bayesian network augmented naïve models these were observed to have the highest predictive accuracies for sydney 78 and south east queensland 94 although disinfectant residuals are among the key variables that lead to trihalomethanes formation potential concentrations of trihalomethanes in distribution systems can be more confidently predicted in terms of probability associated with a wider range of water quality variables using bayesian networks the modelling procedure developed in this work can now be applied to develop system specific bayesian network models for trihalomethanes prediction in other

who world health organization wtp water treatment plant 1 introduction chemical disinfectants are widely used in municipal drinking water systems primary disinfectants such as free chlorine or chlorine dioxide are commonly applied to achieve minimum disinfection doses at drinking water treatment plants wtps treated water is delivered to customers via drinking water distribution systems dwdss comprising storage reservoirs pipes and pumping stations to maintain the quality of drinking water in distribution systems secondary disinfectants which may also include free chlorine but sometimes more stable residuals such as monochloramine are widely used an important aspect of chemical disinfection is the need to control the potential production of disinfection by products dbps these are by products that are produced from reactions between disinfectants and other substances present in the water including both organic and inorganic chemicals richardson and ternes 2011 xie 2003 although most dbp formation is associated with disinfection processes at wtps additional dbps may also be produced during water transmission in dwdss epidemiological studies have indicated that long term exposure to dbps is associated with increased adverse health outcomes including bladder cancer villanueva et al 2004 although over 700 dbps have been identified and more previously unidentified dbps are continuing to emerge only a few selected groups are monitored routinely by water utilities li and mitch 2018 richardson and kimura 2020 most prominently monitored are trihalomethanes thms followed by haloacetic acids li and mitch 2018 thms are known to be the dominant class by mass of halogenated cl br and i dbps in drinking water which are formed by reactions between chlorine and natural organic matter such as humic or fulvic acids crittenden et al 2012 krasner et al 2006 the presence of bromide or iodide ions in the water leads to brominated or iodinated thms respectively xie 2003 four common thm species chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform collectively known as thm4 have been subjected to regulation in the us since 1979 li and mitch 2018 the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality have set guideline values for individual thm4 in drinking water for chloroform 0 3 mg l 1 bromodichloromethane 0 06 mg l 1 dibromochloromethane 0 1 mg l 1 and bromoform 0 1 mg l 1 who 2017 the australian drinking water guidelines adwg has recommended a similar guideline concentration for thms but based on the sum of these four thms which should not exceed 0 25 mg l 1 nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 finding a balance between disinfection efficiency and dbp formation in drinking water remains a challenge for water utilities to minimise thm formation during distribution monochloramine a weaker but more stable disinfectant than free chlorine has been applied as a secondary disinfectant in dwdss richardson and postigo 2015 understanding and predicting dbp formation under a variety of conditions in dwdss is challenging since dbp formation is known to be a multifactorial phenomenon in addition to halogen ions and natural organic matter dbp formation can be influenced by other water quality and operational parameters in dwdss including temperature ph water age turbidity and the concentrations of disinfectant residual and nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and sulphur li et al 2019 many studies have reported on the development of numerical predictive models and multivariate analysis of influencing factors for thms formation brown et al 2011 chen and westerhoff 2010 le roux et al 2012 obolensky and singer 2008 although some regression models have achieved satisfactory prediction on dbps formation with strong correlations to the selected predictors golea et al 2017 these traditional regression models may not be the best approach to capture the complex interrelationships between water quality operational factors and dbps formation having examined this problem in detail we have previously developed the concept of applying bayesian networks as an alternative to facilitate multifactorial modelling and prediction of dbp formation in dwdss li et al 2019 the advantages of bayesian networks in comparison to regression models are described below bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models which can be used to describe causal relationships between model variables marcot 2012 a bayesian network structure consists of nodes representing variables and arcs representing directional connections norsys 2017 an arc starts from a variable which is referred to as a parent node and ends at another variable which is called a child node showing their causal dependencies each node is conditionally independent unless they are linked by arcs holmes and jain 2008 the target variable to be predicted or classified is called a class node if it is not a child node of any other variables which are also called attributes in most bayesian network software continuous variables need to be discretised into a finite set of states chen and pollino 2012 a conditional probability table cpt attached to each node shows the quantified causal relationship between nodes the size of the cpt of a child node grows when the number of its parents and their states increase which increases the complexity associated with populating the cpt chen and pollino 2012 bayesian networks can incorporate parameter uncertainty and variability carvajal et al 2017 based on other given observed data or conditional probability information bayesian networks can also calculate the conditional probabilities of missing states when there are random missing variables holmes and jain 2008 the predictive values are presented as numerical values from regression models whereas in bayesian networks they are presented in terms of probabilities in a range of values e g 90 0 1 mg l 1 9 in 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 and 1 0 2 mg l 1 while many researchers have used traditional regression numerical models to seek the relationship between known influencing variable and thm formation bayesian network is able to capture the subtle interrelationships between variables struhl 2017 when individual parameters are changed in response to observations or what if scenarios the full chain of influence can be observed from a bayesian network in which the interrelationships among predictive variables can be determined similarly bayesian networks facilitate backcasting which enables users to determine the most likely system conditions required to achieve a specified outcome i e thm4 being below guideline values however these can be challenging to achieve in linear regression models which require known data inputs i e all required water parameters in the function to generate a target output i e thm4 concentration especially when there are missing data in the predictive variables of the function thus bayesian network modelling has been shown to offer greater functionality than regression when determining the effects of many variables on an outcome struhl 2017 therefore dbp formation under various conditions can be predicted more realistically in bayesian networks with new conditional probabilities based on bayes theorem developed in the 18th century bayesian networks have been progressively used to determine conditional relationships among variables both attributes and target variables in water quality studies especially in the field of chemical and microbial risk assessment carvajal et al 2015 2017 graham et al 2019 islam et al 2016 zerouali and zerouali 2020 zhu et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 there are only a limited number of thms studies applying bayesian networks among which a dynamic bayesian network zhu et al 2010 and a bayesian belief network bbn zhu et al 2014 have been successfully developed for predicting thm formation and associated health risks in drinking water with the source water quality at wtps as it is a cross discipline technique no predictive model on dbp formation using bayesian networks with water quality parameters in dwdss has been reported to our knowledge in this study predictive bayesian network models were developed to understand and predict the formation of four individual thms and the composite thm4 in australian chloraminated dwdss it was hypothesised that routinely collected parameters could provide a strong predictive capability for thm formation following the model development and optimisation procedures unlike the laboratory controlled studies routinely collected water quality parameters might not have significant variances in treated drinking water and often data for certain known influencing factors such as bromide concentration are unavailable in this work we demonstrate that a bayesian network approach is particularly useful to determine the interrelationships among influencing factors relevant to those specific systems via backcasting and conditional scenario studies water quality data routinely collected by water utilities can be investigated to identify useful predictive relationship in bayesian network applications 2 material and methods a procedure for bayesian network modelling from the approach previously proposed by carvajal et al 2015 with minor modifications was used this procedure incorporated the key steps of data collection and formatting structure development performance evaluation model comparison and selection and model exportation and prediction the focus of this study was to predict the formation of thm4 using other water quality variables correlations of formation between the individual thm4 were also investigated bayesian networks were constructed and evaluated using the waikato environment for knowledge analysis weka v 3 8 4 data mining software the university of waikato new zealand following the modelling procedure displayed in figure a 1 supplementary material netica norsys software corp 2020 a bayesian network software was used to visualise the graphical models developed in weka and undertake case study investigations matlab r2020a was also used in conjunction with weka for preliminary data processing matlab codes are available in the supplementary material section b 2 1 data collection and formatting water quality data were collected from chloraminated dwdss in sydney sydney water nsw january 2010 december 2017 and south east queensland seqwater qld july 2016 august 2019 sydney is serviced by nine separate wtps with 12 associated dwdss cascade illawarra macarthur nepean north richmond orchard hills potts hill prospect east north and south ryde warragamba and woronora systems providing drinking water to about 5 million people there are four dwdss selected from south east queensland brisbane logan southern pipeline and northern pipeline dwdss these systems are supplied from the mount crosby wtps and the north pine wtp together serving nearly 3 million people figure c 1 supplementary material source water in both regions is disinfected with free chlorine as the primary disinfectant at the wtps and then distributed where monochloramine is used as the secondary disinfectant while not all sydney water dwdss routinely practice chloramination only data from chloraminated distribution systems were used in this analysis these two regions have significant differences in their source water quality that should impact thm formation and speciation south east queensland has warmer temperatures and higher bromide concentrations 0 1 0 3 mg l 1 in dwdss in its source water whereas bromide ion is not a significant issue in sydney 0 1 mg l 1 the sample collection period the number of raw and valid data points and selected water quality parameters for bayesian network modelling are listed in table 1 a total of 4742 data points containing thm concentrations were considered valid for bayesian network modelling water quality data listed in table 1 were organised in microsoft excel with each case as a single row in chronological order and with potential influencing factors as columns the raw data were first processed in matlab for visualisation of data distribution concentrations of thm4 and other water quality parameters were plotted in histograms in matlab to give a visual understanding of bin discretisation and the variability of dwdss data from sydney and south east queensland the concentration of thm4 was set to be the class node each water quality variable was processed as an attribute regardless of some variables known to have direct correlations such as conductivity and total dissolved solids tds and total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc this is because interrelationships between variables can be determined in bayesian networks the variables with continuous data needed to be discretised before being used in a bayesian network discretisation of thm4 concentration was conducted manually based on the modeller s judgement in matlab an optimum number of bins for thm4 concentration was determined to be three with discretisation such as 0 1 mg l 1 low 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 moderate and 0 2 mg l 1 high the discretised dataset was saved as a csv file and imported to weka using its inbuilt machine learning algorithm for data mining processes the missing numerical values in the dataset were imputed and replaced using expectation maximisation em with emimputation filter under preprocess tab in weka em is an iterative method to find the maximum likelihood parameters of a statistical model using the estimated sufficient statistics of the known data observations dempster et al 1977 missing temperature values were replaced within each season instead of the whole dataset as a more realistic representation was obtained when the missing value replacement was conducted within each group that had the same pattern the dataset with missing values filled was saved as an arff file for structure development 2 2 structure development a bayesian belief network is a directed acyclic graph which can model non recursive causal relationships in complex systems bbn models can be naïve bayesian nb and semi naïve bayesian snb models a nb model has the target variable as the only parent node with all other independent attributes as its child nodes whereas a snb model is a derivative naïve bayesian model with the target variable as the class node and attributes can have causal relationships with one another mccallum and nigam 1998 there are two examples for snb including the tree augmented naïve tan model where each child node has a causal relationship with maximal two variables and the bayesian network augmented naïve ban model where two or more arcs are allowed between attributes carvajal et al 2015 while a general bbn generates a large conditional probability distribution for the target variable nb and snb give much simpler probabilistic model structures since the parentless target variable only requires marginal probabilities mccallum and nigam 1998 variables listed in table 1 were selected as attribute nodes the initial bbn conceptual model was built in netica based on a proposed model of thms formation developed and described as an outcome of a comprehensive literature review li et al 2019 all influencing factors were the parents to the thm4 concentration however this initial model contained many parent nodes resulting in an excessively large cpt for thm4 concentration to keep the size of the cpt manageable the bayesian network was reconstructed to a simpler probabilistic nb or snb model in weka using its automated structure learning tool which was able to define the optimal number of arcs and the states of nodes in the network three bayesian models one nb one tan and one ban were constructed for each of the two water supply regions to predict the thm4 concentration in dwdss the em filled datasets arff files generated in section 2 1 for each region were loaded respectively in the preprocess function for structure modelling all variables were considered as attribute nodes for the model the network structures were auto learned using bayesnet as the classifier under the classify function in weka explorer using the same searching algorithm and quality measure the number of parents for each node was defined to be one for nb and two for tan according to their definition and not more than three for ban to simplify the process of populating the cpts for child nodes as marcot et al 2006 recommended akaike information criterion score an information theoretic scoring function containing likelihood was selected as the score type to judge the quality of a network structure since it is known to provide a trade off between the model s goodness of fit and its simplicity kjaerulff and madsen 2008 the heuristic search algorithm k2 hill climbing was chosen to construct the networks section d 1 supplementary material details of other searching algorithms available in weka can be found in bouckaert 2008 conventional understandings of causal relationships were also applied to further improve the causal relationship and simplicity of the network structure for example attribute nodes linked to thm4 concentration without various data points i e single state nodes and any child node were removed the number of bins for each predictive attribute were determined by machine learning in weka with the aim of achieving the best representative discretisation with consideration of the relationships among attributes in the model due to the data variabilities between the datasets of sydney and south east queensland the classifications of bins may be different for each attribute in these two models as mentioned in the previous section the number of states of the class node was adjusted to improve the prediction accuracy and the discretisation thresholds were edited manually to better represent relevant concentration thresholds 2 3 model performance evaluation and comparison the evaluation and comparison of multiple models were conducted in weka experimenter using the em filled datasets generated as described in section 2 1 with the same algorithms described in section 2 2 bayesian network models built from the discretised datasets were compared with zeror as the baseline model for each region zeror model represents a network without arcs which always predicts the most likely state of a nominal node and the mean for a numeric node carvajal et al 2015 for each dataset three bayesian network structures were learned including one nb one tan and one ban the performances of all bayesian network models were compared k fold cross validation was chosen to assess the predictive performance of models in this study as it is known to be an unbiased approach for model evaluation bengio and grandvalet 2004 k fold cross validation followed the procedure previously described by boyce et al 2002 section d 2 supplementary material in this study k was taken as 10 so each fold contained around 352 cases for sydney and 121 cases for south east queensland the model performance was evaluated with seven performance parameters these parameters included predictive accuracy kappa statistic area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc true positive rate tpr false positive rate fpr true negative rate tnr and false negative rate fnr these parameters were compared among the three bayesian networks models nb tan ban against the baseline model zeror the one with the best performance was selected for each region standard deviations of each of the parameters were calculated from the results of 10 fold cross validation to assess the variation in the randomised data matrix in weka 2 4 model exportation and prediction the bayesian network model was visualised with states and links of variables in visual graph in weka the best model for each region was selected and exported from weka as a xml model and then imported into netica for prediction study attribute nodes linked to thm4 concentrations with only a single state were removed and the net was compiled a one way sensitivity analysis was done in netica using the function sensitivity to finding to determine the influence of each variable to the target variable thm4 concentration if a variable has a higher variance reduction value the randomness of thm4 concentration is reduced at that variable which means that the variable has higher influence on thm4 concentration as we used the predictive application of bayesian network to predict thm4 concentration the state of thm4 concentration was specified to a certain condition the performance of other variables under such conditional thm4 concentration was presented in terms of probability using the graphical bayesian network nodes the behaviour of thm4 concentration concerning water quality variables was reported and evaluated 2 5 trihalomethane speciation correlations the relationships among thm4 and its individual species in dwdss were studied from the exported bayesian models in netica for each region they were used to predict the concentration of each species under the specified conditions states of thm4 concentration correlations among chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform were investigated by observing changes in predicted concentrations of each species with the set conditions for one thm species in addition correlations of thm speciation were presented graphically by plotting the concentrations of four thm species in scatter diagrams in matlab 3 results and discussion sydney and south east queensland regions represent two types of chloraminated dwdss in which various recorded water quality parameters were observed variations in thm concentrations and speciation were anticipated between the two regions especially at the end of pipes sydney and south east queensland are discussed individually and in comparison with each other in the following subsections 3 1 variability of water quality data the distributions of water qualities in chloraminated dwdss are presented in histograms for sydney fig 1 and south east queensland fig 2 from their respective raw datasets before em imputation there were 21 variables reported including the individual and sum concentrations of thm4 µg l 1 free chlorine mg cl2 l 1 monochloramine mg cl2 l 1 dichloramine mg cl2 l 1 total chlorine mg

the geographical differences between the two regions typically warmer water temperatures were observed in south east queensland with an average of 23 c which is about 8 c higher than the sydney average low to nil free chlorine concentrations were reported in south east queensland dwdss while higher free chlorine concentrations were found in sydney dwdss approximately 21 of sydney dwds free chlorine values exceeded 0 5 mg cl2 l 1 in contrast the mean monochloramine concentration in south east queensland was 3 times higher than that for sydney water ph typically ranged from 7 5 8 in both regions but sydney tended to have a slightly higher average of ph 7 9 compared to the average in south east queensland of ph 7 6 these variations might be due to the differences in source water and operational practices and the distance between sampling points and disinfection facilities for example since the sydney dwdss have a significant amount of cement lined pipework ph at the extremities is sometimes in the range of 8 8 3 occasionally higher ph 8 5 was observed at sydney sampling points closer to wtps where the ph in some systems may be uncontrolled before the first reservoir these sampling locations usually have low to nil free chlorine and a higher concentration of monochloramine compared to those at the more distant ends of the dwds this observation suggested that monochloramine decayed during distribution and as remediation for disinfectant loss breakpoint rechlorination was applied some variables in the collected datasets were only available for south east queensland as shown in table 1 low to nil concentrations of free ammonia and nitrite were observed in the selected south east queensland dwdss with more than 70 frequency of nitrate less than 0 1 mg n l 1 the combinations of only minor observed decay of monochloramine and ammonia along with minor observed increases in nitrate concentration suggest the occurrence of nil or only mild nitrification conditions however under some infrequent conditions nitrate concentration was observed to rise above 0 4 mg n l 1 with co occurring very low concentrations in both monochloramine 0 2 mg cl2 l 1 and ammonia 0 1 mg n l 1 indicating occasional more nitrification doc and toc were generally reported at 3 5 mg l 1 indicating a combination of good source water quality and pre treatment performance as many water utilities strive to achieve turbidity and true colour were below 0 5 ntu and 1 hazen unit respectively these additional water quality variables provided more predictors for the thms bayesian network models the concentrations of thm4 in both regions were mostly below guideline values 0 25 mg l 1 recommended by adwg except for a few outliers 0 2 which were up to 0 3 mg l 1 due to differences in source water quality especially bromide concentrations and operational conditions mentioned previously much higher concentrations of br thms were found in south east queensland compared to sydney for instance the average concentration of bromoform in south east queensland was around 10 µg l 1 with a maximum of 40 µg l 1 whereas 97 of the sydney bromoform results were less than the analytical limit of detection 0 5 µg l 1 with only 3 in the 0 5 6 µg l 1 range to determine the dominant species and correlations of individual thm4 in dwdss the concentrations of chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform of both regions were also plotted in scatter diagrams figure e 1 supplementary material the concentration of chloroform was found to have a negative relationship with the concentrations of dibromochloromethane and bromoform for example in low bromide systems sydney chloroform was observed to be the dominant thm species with an insignificant level of bromoform in contrast br thms concentrations were observed to be abundant in south east queensland as anticipated bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane were the most abundant species when chloroform concentration was low an important factor in producing this outcome is expected to be higher bromide concentrations in south east queensland source water but other potential operational differences may also play a role these include the concentrations of free chlorine and monochloramine which may lead to variable cl br ratios this speciation shifting is consistent with previous reports indicating that the presence of bromide can shift speciation of cl thms to br thms langsa et al 2017 saidan et al 2016 xia et al 2017 zhu et al 2014 the correlations of individual thm4 may help to determine the influence of individual thm species on thm4 in the predictive models which will be discussed in section 3 5 3 2 structures of the optimum bayesian networks the final nodes and states of the selected bayesian network models for thm formations across sydney and south east queensland dwdss are presented in fig 3 the models are based on temporal averages over 8 year records across 12 sydney dwdss and 5 year records across 4 south east queensland dwdss both networks were ban models having thm4 concentration as class nodes which were manually discretised into three bins with thresholds of 0 1 mg l 1 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 all nodes were shown as discrete in weka when exported and were converted back to continuous with discretised states in netica for prediction study the probability of each state of the variable from the training dataset is presented near to the states in each node at the bottom of each continuous node mean values standard deviations calculated from the probabilities of the node states are presented the concentrations of individual thm species were excluded for the optimum predictive models as they were designed to predict thm4 concentration with water quality parameters networks included individual thm species were discussed in section 3 5 the previous study indicated that temperature is among the influencing parameters for dbps formation li et al 2019 however temperature was found to be a single state node in the sydney dwdss bayesian network indicating little correlation between temperature and thm4 concentrations compared to other attributes hence with temperature removed from the predictors there were six attributes in the sydney bayesian network model ph turbidity and chlorine species free chlorine monochloramine dichloramine and total chlorine the attributes of chlorine species were connected by arcs indicating they had interconnections to each other meanwhile as ph was connected to one of the chlorine species nodes the change in ph could result in the chlorine speciation shifting which is consistent with current understandings deborde and von gunten 2008 kinani et al 2012 vikesland et al 2001 there were an additional eight attributes identified as predictors in the south east queensland network model chlorate free and total ammonia nitrate nitrite conductivity tds and doc based on the generated bayesian networks in netica true colour was not considered to be a predictor as it was found to have a negligible impact on the thm4 concentration toc and turbidity are known to be important influencing factors to disinfectant demand leading to thm4 formation power and nagy 1999 ramavandi et al 2015 however toc and turbidity did not vary much in the south east queensland treated water indicating their low predictive capabilities to thm4 concentration compared to other predictors hence toc and turbidity were removed for the optimum ban model achieving an improvement in predictive capability the sampling time linked to the variance in seasonal water quality and daily consumption demands and locations such as at main pipes dead end or near reservoir are known to significantly affect thm formation and other water quality li et al 2019 however these data are not available in the current dataset provided in this study hence the bayesian networks were designed to assess the relationships among those available water quality parameters on an averaged temporal and special basis the model predictability could be further improved by a more refined assessment of temporal and spatial parameters in a future study the development of the bayesian network structure is a challenging task which requires a good understanding of the causal relationships and continuous learning for refinement as an alternative to manual discretisation based on the modeller s judgement discretisation can be undertaken automatically using machine learning however as others have previously observed automatic discretisation may lead to discretisation thresholds which lack relevance or physical meaning chen and pollino 2012 the automatic discretisation thresholds of the target variable thm4 concentration may vary between datasets which may not always be ideal for model comparison or interpretation furthermore the number of discretisation bins affects the performance of the model for example when the number of bins for the models presented here was reduced the accuracy of prediction increased but the predictive results became less relevant based on factors such as their relationship with drinking water guideline thresholds in contrast when the number of bins increased more conditional relationship details were shown with a larger size cpt which increased model complexity and model quantification the performances of models with variable numbers of bins for target variable thm4 concentration discretised manually using matlab and by automatic discretisation via machine learning in weka were compared in the supplementary material section f the number of bins for other attributes however were optimised by machine learning achieving the highest predictive capability of the models 3 3 performance evaluation of bayesian network models seven performance parameters of bayesian network models are displayed in table 2 predictive accuracy was calculated by dividing the number of correctly predicted cases by the total number of cases when the measured thm4 concentration e g 0 095 mg l 1 falls within the predicted range 0 1 mg l 1 it is assumed that the model prediction is correct kappa statistic shows the agreement between model predictions and actual data values with a range of 1 to 1 in which agreement is positively correlated to the kappa statistic value marcot 2012 auc ranging 0 1 shows the capability of a model to distinguish between classes that higher auc indicating better prediction korb and nicholson 2010 tpr refers to the rate of correct positive result prediction whereas fpr type i error refers to the probability that negative result is incorrectly classified to be the positive result setting thm4 0 1 mg l 1 as the positive result as an example tpr is the probability of the predicted thm4 concentrations are classified as low range whereas fpr is the rate that thm4 at moderate and high ranges are predicted as the low range tnr and fnr type ii error are referred to the probability of correct negative result prediction and the probability of positive results being incorrectly predicted respectively these results were generated in weka by calculating the mean values and standard deviation from the 10 fold cross validation procedure the results of sensitivity analysis are available in section h supplementary material the performance measures were derived for three bayesian network model structures one nb one tan and one ban of each region which were each constructed without the concentrations of individual thm species as predictors based on the model performance the optimum network structure was chosen to be ban for both sydney and south east queensland dwdss in addition the performance of the further optimised ban model in which toc and turbidity were excluded as shown in fig 3 for south east queensland was included in table 2 bayesian network models constructed for the sydney dwdss were found to have fair confidence to predict thm4 concentrations with the predictive accuracies ranging 73 78 and aucs around 0 8 these models were found to correctly predict the range of thm4 concentrations very well tpr 89 94 however type i errors of all models were found to be very high fpr 50 indicating a high probability for the models to incorrectly classify high concentration results 0 1 mg l 1 as lower predicted thm4 concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 in addition the kappa statistic was found to be about 0 3 showing that these models had only a fair agreement to the thm4 concentration therefore the overall performance of the bayesian models for sydney dwdss indicated that the predicted thm4 concentrations may not reliably reflect the measured concentrations this error may be due to the limited available water quality variables as predictors for sydney dwdss findings from the sensitivity analysis include that ph turbidity and chlorine species had low variances of beliefs 0 8 12 to thm4 concentration with the additional eight water quality variables being predictors for thm4 concentration the predictive accuracies of all south east queensland bayesian networks were found to be at least 91 implying that more cases were correctly predicted by the models a strong agreement between model predictions and actual data values was observed with the kappa statistic above 0 75 and auc above 0 96 compared to the sydney models the south east queensland models had slightly higher tpr of 97 and a much lower type i errors fpr 20 thus the south east queensland bayesian network models have better performance to predict the thm4 concentrations to a correct range this may be the result of almost all variables having at least 12 variance of beliefs to thm4 concentration which indicated their non negligible influence however considering more water quality parameters in the model construction is not the only factor to improve the model predictive capability data with more variance can be more influential to the target variable bringing an improvement in the predictability of the model for example using the same variables as predictors as sydney models the predictive accuracies of south east queensland bayesian networks reduced to 88 90 which were still at least 10 higher than the sydney models this difference may be the result of chlorine species in south east queensland dwdss having 15 37 variance of beliefs to thm4 concentration which were more influential than those in sydney dwdss 12 the various correlation could be because the sydney records were collected from 12 associated dwdss served by nine separate wtps while there were only four dwdss supplied by two wtps selected from south east queensland if so this would suggest that it is more difficult to develop an accurate universal model than a system specific one comparing the performance of these bayesian network models ban was found to be the best model having the highest predictive accuracy for sydney 78 and south east queensland 94 type ii error rates were insignificant in all models therefore two ban models were selected to predict thm4 concentrations in both regions although the optimum sydney model was found to have 94 confidence to predict thm4 at low concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 it failed to reliably predict thm4 concentrations at a higher range the optimum south east queensland model also found it challenging to predict high thm4 concentration 0 2 mg l 1 even though its tprs for low 0 1 mg l 1 and moderate 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 concentrations were 97 and 80 this is due to the limited cases at high concentration in the recorded datasets for both regions hence to improve the predictive performance for the models it is necessary to train the model with more cases at high thm4 concentrations 3 4 estimation of trihalomethanes concentration as the high predictive accuracy of bayesian network models occurred at only low thm4 concentration for sydney and low to moderate ranges of thm4 concentration for south east queensland the occurrence of thm4 concentration in these target ranges were predicted the thm4 concentrations were predicted in terms of probability of its states by setting conditions of each variable in the order of its variance of belief to the predicted variable the results of conditional scenarios are discussed as follows and depicted in figures g 1 and g 2 supplementary material the interrelationships among attributes can be observed in the bayesian networks as the change in an individual variable also affects the probabilities of the states of target variable as well as other attributes the relationship between predicted vs actual thms is presented in the confusion matrices presented in section f 3 supplementary material according to the sydney model when monochloramine is the dominant chlorine species in chloraminated dwdss with its concentrations above 0 21 mg cl2 l 1 the concentrations of free chlorine which could be the product of the self decay of monochloramine were mostly 96 below 0 025 mg cl2 l 1 under such condition the predictivethm4 concentrations were observed to be 78 97 at the low range 0 1 mg l 1 in contrast the probability of thm4 concentration at low range dropped to about 30 70 under the conditions of low monochloramine 0 21 mg cl2 l 1 and elevated free chlorine 0 025 mg cl2 l 1 concentrations regardless of the conditions of turbidity and ph the result indicated that high thms formation was associated with high free chlorine concentration which could be a result of monochloramine loss or rechlorination however since the presence of pathogenic microorganisms has greater risks to human health applying breakpoint rechlorination was necessary as remediation for significant monochloramine loss during water delivery as mentioned in section 3 1 therefore managing monochloramine decay may be among the approaches to control thms formation in sydney dwdss under the current source water quality similar to the sydney model thm4 concentrations of south east queensland dwdss were predicted to be 98 at the low range 0 1 mg l 1 and 1 9 at the moderate range 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 under the conditions of high monochloramine 0 95 mg cl2 l 1 and low free chlorine 0 06 mg cl2 l 1 concentrations the probabilities of thm4 concentration were estimated under the conditional states of other water quality parameters the predicted probability of thm4 concentrations 0 1 mg l 1 was found to be 99 9 under the conditions of ph ranging 7 5 8 3 and low levels of conductivity 474 µs cm 1 tds 252 mg l 1 and doc 3 6 mg l 1 especially at a temperature below 23 c however the probability of moderate thm4 concentration increased to 45 when the new conditions of temperature 23 c and ph 7 5 were applied on the previous setting the increase in temperature and decrease in ph was also found to elevate the mean concentration of free ammonia from 0 08 to 0 17 mg n l 1 and reduce the mean concentration of monochloramine from 2 3 to 0 79 mg cl2 l 1 this result demonstrated that warmer seasons and low ph promoted monochloramine decay which simultaneously affected thm4 concentration in addition if the tds and or doc concentrations increased under such conditions the thm4 concentrations were predicted to have higher probabilities at the moderate range 60 80 when it was in cooler seasons 23 1 c however the increase in concentrations of tds and doc was observed to decrease the probability of low range thm4 concentration to 72 with about 25 chance of thm4 in the moderate level these observations indicated that doc is among the important influencing factors for thm4 formation however the concentrations of doc from the treated water were highly stable in the selected dataset thus it does not provide strong predictive capability for thm4 concentration only 4 variance of beliefs hence it may be an effective thm control measure to reduce the concentrations of doc and tds before disinfection and to maintain the drinking water at a higher ph range of 7 5 8 3 to mitigate monochloramine decay especially during warmer seasons 3 5 evaluation of individual trihalomethane species in australia drinking water guideline values are not defined for individual thm species but only for composite thm4 however separate guideline values for each compound have been recommended by the who 2017 the bromodichloromethane concentrations on some occasions were found to exceed the who guideline value of 0 06 mg l 1 but the thm4 concentrations were found to be 0 18 0 23 mg l 1 which is below the adwg guideline value of 0 25 mg l 1 in addition br thms have been found more toxic than chloroform richardson et al 2007 any water utility that wants to understand toxicity associated with dbps needs to carefully consider the specific composition of dbps and their relative toxicity potency for example bromodichloromethane has been reported to have higher genotoxicity than chloroform and high concentrations of bromoform have been linked to an increased risk of rectal cancer richardson et al 2007 thus when developing control measures for dbps it may be more appropriate to consider each thm concentration individually instead of just the sum concentration of thm4 to evaluate the importance of the influence of individual thm species to the predictive models bayesian network models with individual thm concentrations were developed to compare with those excluding them as attribute nodes the optimum network structures are presented in fig 4 the performance parameters are presented in the supplementary material table f 1 table f 2 3 5 1 performance evaluation of bayesian networks with individual thm4 as attributes models with individual thm4 for sydney were found to have predictive accuracies of at least 90 and kappa statistic raised from 0 3 to above 0 8 indicating that the models exhibited very high agreement with measured data this is the result of chloroform and bromodichloromethane which were reported to be the dominant thm species in sydney dwdss in the sensitivity analysis chloroform was found to contribute the most influence on thm4 concentration with 81 variance of beliefs followed by bromodichloromethane 35 the other water quality variables in the sydney model were found to have lesser influence 12 variance of beliefs on thm4 concentration when chloroform and bromodichloromethane were considered as the only thm species 83 of the thm4 concentrations records were found to have less than 10 errors while only 2 of the records had 20 35 errors this implies that thm4 concentrations in sydney dwdss could potentially be derived from the measured concentrations of just two thm species chloroform and bromodichloromethane in contrast including individual thm concentrations did not have significant impacts on the performance of the south east queensland models which had their predictive accuracy raised only from 94 to 98 this is because there are 14 other important predictors besides the concentrations of individual thm4 at least 5 of these additional predictors have moderate influences on the thm4 concentration with 20 38 variance of beliefs while the rest have at least 8 impacts although the influence of individual thm concentrations is significant on the thm4 concentration they have little impact on the bayesian network models when there are more other highly influencing predictors hence other water quality variables besides individual thm4 should be considered to predict the thm4 concentrations in south east queensland dwdss 3 5 2 influence of water quality variables on thm speciation the relationships between water quality variables and individual thms can be derived from the bayesian models under specified scenarios these scenarios described here are presented in figure g 3 supplementary material as a full chain of influence can be observed from the network rather than just the targeted output like linear regression models the concentrations of individual thm species as well as other non conditional parameters can be predicted from the commonly measured water quality parameters of specified conditions even though they are not the targeted output thm4 in the model bromide is well understood to be an important factor in the production of thms however many water utilities do not routinely collect bromide concentration data in source water since bromide itself is usually not directly regulated thus this parameter is often not readily available for inclusion in bayesian network models instead accumulated water quality datasets tend to be focused on regulated parameters such as individual thms nonetheless bayesian network development may assist in identifying whether any other of the collected parameters may effectively provide a surrogate indication of bromide presence according to the south east queensland bayesian network model fig 4 b an increase in conductivity from 473 µs cm 1 to 575 µs cm 1 and tds from 251 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 at ph above 7 5 was found to decrease the probability of bromoform 10 µg l 1 from 91 to only 14 dibromochloromethane 32 µg l 1 from 97 to 35 and bromodichloromethane 28 µg l 1 from 92 to 56 compared to br thms this change was found to have a much less impact on chloroform that the probability of chloroform 28 µg l 1 reduced by 15 this observation indicates that the concentrations of br thms especially those with higher bromine content have a positive relationship with conductivity and tds similar result was observed when conductivity and tds elevated at ph 7 5 however the thm speciation was not shifted as much as it was at a higher ph for example under the condition of higher conductivity and tds higher probabilities of chloroform 28 µg l 1 and bromoform 10 µg l 1 were observed at ph 7 5 compared to a higher ph the reason for this observation was evaluated from the interrelationship between variables drawn from the bayesian network it was observed from the network that low ph was often associated with free chlorine being the most likely dominant disinfectant whereas monochloramine was the dominant disinfectant at high ph as conductivity and tds were shown to have a positive relationship with bromide concentration high cl br ratio was expected in the water with high conductivity and tds when free chlorine concentration was high low ph thus lower concentrations of br thms were expected to form under such conditions in contrast low cl br ratio resulted in high br thms concentration these findings are consistent with previous reported observations sathasivan et al 2020 the model which included individual thm species shows that lower conductivity and tds may provide useful surrogate indicators of lower concentrations of bromide ions in the water which was led to the low concentration of br thms this finding also indicates that br thms could be effectively reduced by reducing tds however removing bromide or dissolved solids from the source water may be challenging in practice as it requires advanced treatment such as reverse osmosis membrane filtration nonetheless higher doc concentrations 3 5 mg l 1 were also found to be associated with a lower probability of bromoform 10 µg l 1 hence an alternative measure to minimise bromoform formation at the same tds and conductivity levels could be to target high ph and low doc concentration while maintaining a high cl br ratio 4 conclusion bayesian network models for thm4 formation in dwdss can be produced by following the procedures of model development and optimisation relying on the existing utility water quality data potential thms concentrations in dwdss can be confidently predicted in bayesian network in terms of probability using the concentrations of disinfectant residuals nitrogen species ph tds doc conductivity and other water quality parameters but in much less confidence with only disinfectant residuals and ph alone in this study naïve and semi naïve bayesian network models were constructed and assessed for predicting thms in sydney and south east queensland dwdss ban models were selected to be the optimum predictive models in weka with manual discretisation based on the modeller s judgement for both regions although disinfectant residuals are among the key parameters that lead to thms formation the comparison of the ban models between two regions shows that the additional variables such as ph nitrogen species tds and conductivity are also important in influencing thms concentration in dwdss therefore it is important to understand the overall water chemistry leading to thms formation instead of limiting to a few parameters when developing predictive models for dbps key findings from this study are monochloramine has a negative correlation to thms formation indicating the gradual decay of monochloramine leads to the consequential formation of thms in dwdss high free chlorine concentration is associated with high thms formation especially cl thms which likely reflects the redosing of free chlorine within the distribution system after significant monochloramine decay managing monochloramine decay may be an effective strategy to control thm formation which may be achieved by maintaining a higher ph range consistent with current understanding low concentrations of doc and tds lead to reduced thm formation in dwdss thus thm formation may be managed by minimising doc and tds in the dwdss especially during warmer seasons applying higher ph is an alternative to reduce thm formation when low concentrations of tds is hard to achieve however high ph associates with low free chlorine concentration which increases the likelihood of higher br thms formation in water with high bromide concentration due to lower cl br ratios lower conductivity and tds are associated with minimising the formation of bromoform indicating that they are a reasonable surrogate measure for bromide ions although the thm prediction models are system specific the development of a bayesian network modelling framework for thms concentration presented in this work can be applied generally to other dwdss declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
