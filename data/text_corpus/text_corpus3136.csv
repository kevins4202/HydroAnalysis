15680,persulfate ps s2o8 2 activation through transition metal sulfides tms has gained increasing attention since it can decompose a wide variety of refractory halogenated organic compounds in groundwater and wastewater however the processes of ps activation by tms and particularly the formation of oh radical under anoxic and acidic conditions ph 2 8 remain elusive herein by employing mixed redox couple involved chalcopyrite cufes2 150 mg l nanoparticles for ps 3 0 mm activation 96 of trichloroethylene was degraded within 120 min at ph 6 8 under visible light irradiation the combination of experimental studies and theoretical calculations suggested that the cu i fe iii mixed redox couple in cufes2 plays a crucial role to activate ps cu i acted as an electron donor to transfer electron to fe iii then fe iii served as an electron transfer bridge as well as a catalytic center to further donate this received electron to the o o bond of ps thus yielding so4 for trichloroethylene oxidation moreover for the first time oh radicals were found to form from the catalytic hydrolysis of ps onto cufes2 surface where s2o8 2 anion was hydrolyzed to yield h2o2 and these ensuing h2o2 were further transformed into oh radicals via photoelectron assisted o o bond cleavage step our findings offer valuable insights for understanding the mechanisms of ps activation by redox couple involved tms which could promote the design of effective activators toward ps decomposition for environmental remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorinated

introduction groundwater is the vital water source for agricultural irrigation and drinking water accounting for approximately 22 to 30 of worldwide freshwater foster and chilton 2003 giordano 2009 nonetheless as the groundwater aquifers contamination increases the supply demand contradiction of clean groundwater resources becomes noteworthy chlorinated organic contaminants cocs such as trichloroethylene tce are widely used as household and consumer products and persistent in the environment moran et al 2007 rangan et al 2020 due to their illegal dumping and accidental leakage from the ground storage tanks lien et al 2016 cocs have become a category of frequently detected organic pollutants in groundwater stroo et al 2012 it is reported that cocs have contaminated over 125 000 sites in the united state level above the cleanup goals entwistle et al 2019 and their source concentrations moran et al 2007 are often several orders of magnitude higher than the maximum contaminant levels i e 5 μg l established for drinking water usepa 2018 the uptake of cocs from water or food chain can result in chronic and acute human health problems including liver and kidney damage reduced fertility childhood leukaemia spontaneous abortions and cancer mao et al 2012 teel et al 2001 etc to remediate cocs contaminated waters and soils significant efforts have been devoted to developing novel remediation technologies via different physical or biochemical approaches over the past three decades among all the state of the art remediation techniques persulfate ps s2o8 2 based advanced oxidation technology has been recognized as one of the most splendid techniques that offer an effective way for a wide range of in situ recalcitrant organic pollutants attenuation in soil and groundwater huang et al 2019 li et al 2018 liu et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 compared with the conventionally used chemical oxidant hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ps is relatively stable and therefore can be delivered to subsurface contaminated zone with a longer transport distance and larger remediation area resulting in a higher utilization efficiency in groundwater remediation xiao et al 2020 moreover ps has shown the highest reaction stoichiometric efficiency rse among the frequently reported oxidants in aops the rse is defined as the number of moles of probe degraded over the number of moles of ps consumed for example ps activated with iron powder showed rse value below 5 ghauch and ayoub 2014 ghauch et al 2013 while if fe is employed in mof and used as a catalyst the rse value reached up to 30 40 asmar et al 2021 furthermore uv254 activation reached a rse value of 55 hakim et al 2020 and thermal activation showed even greater rse value up to 60 baalbaki et al 2018 furthermore the convenient storage and lower price of ps can further reduce the practical environmental engineering cost lee et al 2020 with ps as the oxidant there are two general ways of activating s2o8 2 anion to produce reactive oxygen species ros including homolysis of the peroxide bond o o using heat or light eq 1 and via a redox process with transition metals mn as electron donors in either homogeneous or heterogeneous media eq 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 ayoub and ghauch 2014 ghauch et al 2017 naim and ghauch 2016 waldemer et al 2007 wang and wang 2018 once s2o8 2 anion is activated the chain reactions producing other ros will be initiated to oxidize organic pollutants more quickly and deeply than ps directly does for in situ applications recent attention has been mainly dedicated to ps activation based on eq 2 since it shows higher efficiency and requires no external equipment supply as well as constant energy input luo et al 2021 oh and lim 2019 1 s 2 o 8 2 h e a t o r h v 2 s o 4

available coughlan et al 2017 li et al 2021a moreover compared to other commonly used transition metal oxides tms show better electrical conductivity robust reduction reactivity and superior optical characteristics sandroni et al 2017 chalcopyrite cufes2 as one of such conspicuous tms that made up of cu i fe iii mixed redox couple ge et al 2020 where two metal cations with opposite redox properties are connected via a nonmetal anion within its crystal structure has attracted growing attention and been used as an efficient oxidant activator for dyes silveira et al 2020 huang et al 2020a tyrosol ltaïef et al 2018 antibiotics droguett et al 2020 li et al 2021 and phenolic nie et al 2019 peng et al 2020 xu et al 2019 degradation although cufes2 has been employed for environmental remediation it is barely explored for the activation of ps towards cocs degradation furthermore the activation mechanism of cufes2 mediated chemical oxidants decomposition especially the specific catalytic active sites between the mixed redox couple for o o bond dissociation via one electron transfer process down to atomic scale remains unclear meanwhile in addition to so4 radical increased evidence yang et al 2020 yuan et al 2014 suggested the prominent role of oh radical in ps aops for organic pollutants degradation but the routes of oh radical formation especially under acidic and anoxic conditions are still quite limited herein for the first time we employed cufes2 to activate ps towarded the degradation of tce a representative cocs frequently prevalent in contaminated groundwater the core objectives of this study were i to examine the potential of employing cufes2 to activate ps towards tce degradation under visible light irradiation ii to explore the underlying activation mechanisms involved in the ps cufes2 system and the specific roles of cu i fe iii mixed redox couple in cufes2 for radicals formation and iii to elucidate the possible degradation pathways of tce in the ps cufes2 reaction system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials all the chemicals text s1 in the supporting information were used as received without extra purification ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was purged with n2 for 30 min before being used for solution preparation the chalcopyrite nanoparticles nps were prepared through a modified chemical colloidal synthesis approach vaure et al 2018 and materials characterization details were given in text s2 2 2 experimental procedures all the batch tests were performed in borosilicate glass vials containing 30 ml aqueous solution of tce under led lamp illumination 1 72 mw cm2 30 w unless otherwise mentioned the initial concentration of tce was 0 15 mm which is a typical tce level in contaminated groundwater lo et al 2006 and a commonly used experimental concentration gu et al 2018 shan et al 2020 yan et al 2016 in transition metal based aop studies the initial ph of the reaction solution was adjusted to 6 8 0 2 by using 0 1 m h2so4 or naoh and was not controlled during the degradation process a specific amount of cufes2 nps was well dispersed into the tce solution and the suspension was mechanically stirred for 60 min to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium the preliminary experiments revealed that 60 min was enough to achieve the adsorption equilibrium then a 0 1 ml of solution sample was withdrawn from the vials to determine the concentration the obtained tce concentration was used as the initial concentration c0 for the sequent degradation experiments subsequently a desired dose of ps was added into the suspension to trigger the reaction the molar ratio of ps to tce was 20 1 aliquots were taken out from the vials at predetermined time intervals and quenched by adding 2 0 ml methanol immediately then filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter the details of the experimental procedures tce concentration analytical methods scavenger tests and electron spin resonance esr for ros analysis were summarized in text s3 and text s4 of the supporting information respectively furthermore tests were also conducted in actual groundwater samples to investigate the performance of the ps cufes2 system for tce degradation in real environment water the groundwater samples were collected from a local groundwater observation well in shenzhen guangdong province e 114 4 n 22 7 and the physicochemical properties of the natural groundwater were listed in table s1 a specific amount of tce stock solution was added to the groundwater sample as the initial tce concentration 0 15 mm before degradation experiments all the above mentioned batch experiments were performed at least triplicate to ensure the reproducibility of experimental results within the errors 5 of the experiments the average values with standard errors were reported 2 3 computational methods the electronic structure of ps and h2o2 adsorbed cufes2 structure catalytic hydrolysis pathways of ps and tce degradation pathways were conducted through vienna ab inito simulation package vasp kresse and furthmüller 1996a 1996b kresse and hafner 1993 cp2k kühne et al 2020 and gaussian 16 package frisch et al 2016 respectively multiwfn lu and chen 2012 was used for cp2k input file generation vaspkit wang et al 2021 was used for vasp post analysis the details of all the calculations were illustrated in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cufes2 nps the crystalline structures of the as synthesized chalcopyrite nps were analyzed with powder x ray diffraction pxrd compared with the pxrd patterns from standard material fig s1a noticeable multiple sharp diffraction peaks located at 2θ of 29 3 33 8 48 76 49 2 and 57 7 confirmed the synthesized nps were dominated with the chalcopyrite phase cufes2 with jcpds no 37 0471 bright field transmission electron microscope tem image showed that the cufes2 nps were crystallized quasi isotropic shape fig s1c with an average size range of 20 25 nm based on the statistic histogram of the size distribution fig s1b in addition the observed lattice fringe in the high resolution tem image in fig s1d is of a d spacing value of 0 304 nm corresponding well to the lattice spacing of 112 lattice plane which double confirmed the as synthesized nps were the tetragonal phase cufes2 in this structure the typical cu i fe iii mixed redox couple is involved in the crystal structure the high angle annular dark field haadf scanning transmission electron microscopy stem image and stem energy dispersive spectrometer eds images validated fe cu and s were uniformly distributed throughout the as synthesized cufes2 nps figs s1 e h overall these results suggest that cufes2 nps were successfully synthesized in the present study the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra uv vis drs were performed to investigate the optical absorption capability of the cufes2 nps as displayed in fig s2 the estimated optical band gap energy eg value of the cufes2 sample was approximately 1 05 ev according to the plot of αhν 2 as a function of photo energy hν using tauc s equation tauc et al 1966 which suggests that cufes2 is a semiconducting material with light responsible range covers from visible light to near infrared light range 3 2 degradation performance of tce in ps cufes2 system in this study the directly oxidized by ps or adsorbed onto cufes2 nps alone can result in tce elimination therefore except for investigating tce degradation in the ps cufes2 system tce removal tests by ps and cufes2 nps were also evaluated individually additionally to determine the tce loss due to its volatilization during the reaction a control test was conducted under identical conditions without adding cufes2 activator or ps as shown in fig 1 a tce was fast removed by the ps cufes2 system and more than 96 of tce was degraded within 120 min meanwhile only about 29 3 fig 1b and 9 3 fig 1c of tce were directly removed by 150 mg l of cufes2 and 3 0 mm of ps alone indicating a synergistic effect on tce degradation was achieved by combining cufes2 activator and ps oxidant and their interaction is the primary source for ros generation the performance of tce degradation under dark conditions the reaction vials were covered by aluminum foil was also explored fig 1a shows the tce degradation efficiencies 87 9 were lower than those under visible light irradiation suggesting the promoted role of visible light for tce degradation in the ps cufes2 oxidation system this phenomenon could be due to the narrow band semiconducting nature of cufes2 where the visible light induced the increased amounts of generated photoelectrons transfer from cufes2 to o o bond of ps thus facilitating the o o bonds scission and higher concentration of ros formation for tce oxidation to optimize tce degradation in the ps cufes2 system the dosage effects of cufes2 and ps on tce degradation were investigated individually fig 2 a displays the tce degradation performance with different dosages of cufes2 nps with fixed ps concentration 3 0 mm when the dosage of cufes2 increased from 75 mg l to 150 mg l the degradation rate of tce was accelerated and the final degradation efficiency after 120 min increased to 96 8 accordingly a higher dosage of cufes2 suspended particles could offer more active sites for ps activation so a faster removal of tce was achieved by the elevated levels of ros however further increasing the dosage of cufes2 to 300 mg l had less benefit to tce degradation the higher amount of cufes2 could result in more cufes2 nps aggregation and block out more visible light ji et al 2021 yang et al 2021 after fixing cufes2 dosage at 150 mg l the degradation rate of tce increased with ps concentration increasing from 1 5 to 3 0 mm after which tce degradation significantly decreased fig 2b since ps is the radical donor an appropriate increase of ps concentration can improve tce degradation as more ros were generated and reacted with tce however excessive ps ps 0 4 5 mm would also act as radicals sink which competed with tce for reaction as described by eq 3 liang et al 2007 yang et al 2020 and thus resulted in a lower tce degradation efficiency 3 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 s o 4 2 the corresponding kinetic calculations were studied by using a pseudo first order kinetic model as shown in the following equation ln c c 0 kt where k min 1 is the reaction rate constant and c 0 as well as c represent tce concentrations at time t 0 and t min respectively as seen in figs 2c and 2d the experimental results fitted well with the first order kinetics and the rate constant k achieved the highest value at 150 mg l cufes2 and 3 0 mm ps respectively to sum up the tce degradation efficiency can be enhanced by the appropriately increased amount of cufes2 and ps since the maximum ros yield depends on the optimal concentrations of cufes2 and ps further the calculated rse was 4 84 under this optimized reaction condition which is comparable to that of rse obtained in other researchers work when using fe based materials as the ps activator ghauch and ayoub 2014 ghauch et al 2013 and much higher than those reported rse values in h2o2 based in situ chemical oxidation 0 28 jia et al 2018 pham et al 2012 in addition a comparative study for tce degradation by ps activated with various transition metal based activators reported in the literature is presented in table s2 it was found that the tce activator mg mg for the cufes2 was much higher than those of other transition metal based activators which exhibits the superiority of cufes2 compared to other conventional transition metal based activators and proves that the cufes2 nps is a promising candidate for ps activation towards tce degradation the release amount of generated chloride ions cl in the solution in parallel with tce degradation in the ps cufes2 reaction system was monitored theoretically 3 0 mm of cl ions will be released from the complete dichlorination process of 1 0 mm of tce i e 15 98 mg l cl ions in total will be liberated from 20 mg l of tce therefore based on the remaining concentrations of tce in presented in fig 1a the theoretical yields of cl ions at 5 15 30 60 and 120 min should be 10 77 13 94 15 07 15 25 and 15 47 mg l respectively however as shown in fig s3 the determined concentrations of cl ions in solution were 7 07 11 63 12 75 12 81 and 13 18 mg l respectively the gap between the detected cl and the theoretical cl ions suggests that tce was partially degraded and chlorinated intermediates were formed during the 120 min reaction time the practical application potential of the ps cufes2 system for actual groundwater remediation was evaluated and shown in fig s4 compared with the results in ultrapure water when groundwater was used as a background solution the inhibition effect was visible probably attributed to the co existent ions and dissolved organic molecules in the natural groundwater sample dong et al 2019 hakim et al 2019 2020 huang et al 2019 although the tce degradation rate was suppressed the final tce degradation efficiency still reached 90 indicating the real application prospects of this ps cufes2 system for groundwater remediation since the concentrations of the dissolved fe and cu ions from cufes2 nps after a 120 min reaction were about 14 mg l and 34 mg l data not shown respectively the control experiments with the co existent of fe3 and cu2 ions for homogeneously ps activation toward tce degradation were explored as seen in fig s5 the tce degradation efficiency in 120 min was about 9 0 which is comparable to the tce removal efficiency by ps alone indicating that the homogeneous leached fe and cu ions have minor effects on tce degradation while the degradation was mainly attributed to the heterogeneous ps activation process 3 3 identification of ros in ps cufes2 system for the degradation of organic contaminants by transition metals activated ps so4 is usually assumed as the dominant radical nevertheless the role of oh in activated ps process has recently been recognized and was experimentally validated to be even more pronounced than that of so4 for organic pollutants oxidation ahmad et al 2012 yuan et al 2014 therefore excessive tertiary butyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were separately added to the reaction solution to identify the contribution of intermediated reactive species to tce oxidation in the ps cufes2 system in comparison to the controlled experiments without scavenger the degradation efficiency of tce after 120 min was significantly inhibited by adding meoh and tba which were respectively 32 7 k 3 83 10 3 min 1 and 43 9 k 4 52 10 3 min 1 as displayed in fig 3 a the relatively higher inhibition of tce degradation efficiency with meoh revealed that both so4 and oh radicals were produced and contributed to tce degradation while oh was relatively more pronounced than so4 in the ps cufes2 system to further identify the presence of ros and explain the degradation mechanisms in the ps cufes2 system the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo trapped electron spin resonance esr spectra of the reaction solution were recorded fig 3b shows the esr spectrum of ps and ps cufes2 no characteristic peaks were identified in dmpo and ps alone system implying that no radical was produced without the cufes2 activator when ps was added together with cufes2 and dmpo typical and intense esr signals of dmpo oh adducts four fold characteristic 1 2 2 1 peak and relatively weak esr signals of dmpo so4 adducts six peak spectrum were detected suggesting both oh and so4 radicals were presented moreover the peak intensity of dmpo so4 adducts was much weaker in comparison with that of dmpo oh adducts implying that the concentration of so4 was lower than oh which was consistent with the radical quenching experiments in addition the signal of dmpo so4 slightly decreased as the reaction time progressed while the peak of dmpo oh adduct increased obviously from 1 to 5 min showing that numerous oh were persistently produced to sum up based on the results of esr spectra and scavenger tests oh radical rather than so4 radical was predominantly produced during the heterogeneous cufes2 activated ps process 3 4 insights into ps activation mechanism by cufes2 3 4 1 role of cu fe and s species in ps activation xps analysis was applied to determine the chemical environments of all three elements and compare the difference of cufes2 nps before and after the reaction as seen in fig 3c the survey scan of fresh and used cufes2 manifest the presence of cu 2p fe 2p s 2p and o 1 s for fresh cufes2 the positions of cu 2p3 2 peaks fig 3d were respectively 931 92 ev and 933 17 ev where both corresponded to cu i xu et al 2019 also the cu 2p1 2 peak at 952 53 ev was attributed to cu i species deen and asselin 2016 no cu 2p3 2 shake up satellite peak associated with cu ii was observed three peaks of fe 2p3 2 fig 3e were occurred at 707 78 ev 710 78 ev and 713 67 ev respectively the former two peaks corresponded well to fe iii s and fe iii o brrion 1980 while the last peak 713 67 ev may reflect the signal of surface unsaturated fe iii that bonded to less s ii than bulk fe iii andersson et al 2004 schiros et al 2010 von oertzen et al 2006 the two different positions of s species in fig 3f 161 10 ev and 162 23 ev were both corresponded to s 2p3 2 which represented the signals of monosulfide s2 and disulfide s2 2 ghahremaninezhad et al 2013 respectively additionally the peak that appeared at 163 73 ev has corresponded to polysulfide sn 2 n 2 species the peak for o 1 s occurred at 531 7 ev could be due to the possible air oxidation of the as prepared cufes2 nps compared to the xps spectra of fresh cufes2 nps the peak positions of different elements were almost the same after the reaction but with varied proportions especially for cu and fe after reaction the proportion of cu i decreased from 24 4 to 18 0 while fe iii increased from 27 4 to 33 8 the s ii proportion was almost unchanged from 48 3 to 48 2 these results indicate that both cu and fe participated in activating ps via electron transfer however noting that there was no signal of fe ii and cu ii in the xps spectra this phenomenon was not able to be illustrated by the redox potentials of fe iii fe ii 0 77 ev vs she and cu ii cu i 0 159 ev vs she couples in aqueous solutions therefore the density of state dos calculations were performed to give an in depth insight into the mechanisms of ps activation by cufes2 nps and the details were discussed in the subsequent sections the mechanism of single electron transfer induced reductive cleavage of o o in peroxide through eqs 1 and 2 were commonly reported to elucidate the activation mechanism in ps based heterogeneous advanced oxidation process ps aop liu et al 2014 oh et al 2016 tang et al 2020 wang and wang 2018 whereby an electron flows from the transition metal based activator into the o o bond of peroxide and then induces its cleavage when using a photo sensitive transition metal based material as an activator the single electron transfer reduction process could be accelerated upon visible light absorption because the photoexcited electrons in the conduction band cb of the semiconductive activator have higher energy levels than the valence band vb to reduce ps and thus to make its o o bond cleavage easier to further elucidate the inherent role of cu fe and s of cufes2 for this photo assisted reductive cleavage of o o bond in ps the dos analysis was employed to investigate the electronic structure of s2o8 2 anions adsorbed onto cufes2 surface with vasp kresse and furthmiiller 1996 kresse and furthmü 1996 kresse and hafner 1993 as shown in fig 4 a the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy of ps corresponds well to the cb of cufes2 indicating the probable electron transfer from cufes2 cb to ps lumo thus leading to the reduction and o o bond cleavage process of ps the dos diagram also reveals the function of three elements of cufes2 during ps activation the vb of cufes2 was mainly composed of the cu 3d and s 3p orbitals while its cb was primarily occupied by the fe 3d orbitals suggesting that the metal metal charge transfer eq 4 from cu to fe and ligand metal charge transfer eq 5 from s to fe processes would be favorable to take place during visible light irradiation miessler et al 2013 in other words both cu i and s ii could act as electron donors during visible light excitation while cu i is more likely to be the predominant electron donor since the electron configuration of cu ii s ii is more thermodynamically stable than that of cu i s i meanwhile fe iii could act as an electron transfer bridge as well as the catalytic center which accepted the photoexcited electron from cu and s temporarily transformed into fe ii then directly reduced s2o8 2 anion to ros with the received photoelectron and converted back to fe iii as shown in fig 4b and eq 6 4 fe iii s ii cu i heat or hv fe ii e h ν s ii cu ii h 5 fe iii s ii cu i heat or hv fe ii e h ν s i h cu i fe

commonly recognized mechanisms for the routes of oh radicals formation including oxygen molecular reduction by photoelectron eq 8 deng et al 2021 fang et al 2013 keenan and sedlak 2008a and 2008b li et al 2019 water oxidation by photogenerated holes eq 9 tang et al 2020 and hydrolysis of so4 under alkaline and neutral conditions eqs 10 and 11 furman et al 2010 liang and su 2009 wang and zhang 2018 since the tce degradation tests were performed under oxygen free conditions so the main pathway of oh radicals formation via the oxygen reduction route can be ruled out in addition the reported vb maximum of cufes2 0 88 v vs she schoonen and xu 2000 is much lower than the standard redox potential for oh h h2o couple 2 8 v vs she wang and zhang 2018 at ph 7 so the generation of oh radicals via direct oxidation of h2o by photoexcited holes in cufes2 vb is not thermodynamically favorable previous reports furman et al 2010 liang et al 2007 liang and su 2009 have shown that oh could be generated through the reaction of so4 with h2o at a very low rate kso4 h2o 2 103 s 1 while the conversion of so4 into oh become increasingly noticeable under alkaline conditions ph 8 5 due to the higher reaction rate of so4 with oh kso4 oh 6 5 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 since the tce degradation reactions started at the neutral condition ph initial 6 8 and quickly dropped to 2 8 within 5 min and kept constant after reaction data not shown the alkaline hydrolysis of so4 would not be able to occur also the reaction between so4 and h2o would not be the possible dominant route for oh radicals formation because the reaction rate appears to be less significant under all ph conditions this implies that the accumulation of oh radicals during the reaction was generated via other pathways instead of the three possible routes mentioned above the oh is more likely to be generated from the hydrolysis of s2o8 2 anion which is a two step process with hydroperoxoymonosulfate anion hso5 as the transient intermediate eqs 12 and 13 hayon et al 1972 usually the hydrolysis of s2o8 2 anion to produce hso5 anion will not occur at room temperature due to the high activation energy which was 32 kcal mol 1 under neutral conditions and 26 kcal mol 1 under acidic conditions hayon et al 1972 respectively to compare the reaction pathways and transition states of uncatalyzed and catalyzed ps hydrolysis onto cufes2 surface the gfn1 xtb method and ci neb algorithm with cp2k package goedecker et al 1996 lippert et al 1997 perdew et al 1996 were conducted the computation results revealed that the ps hydrolysis processes would be permissible to take place with the involvement of cufes2 as seen from the electron energy diagrams in figs 4c and 4d interestingly in both elementary hydrolysis steps the transition state energies of the adsorbed ps onto cufes2 surface were significantly lower than the homogenous ones without cufes2 involvement which were respectively lowered by 17 2 kcal mol 1 and 20 8 kcal mol 1 the lower activation energy makes s2o8 2 anion able to hydrolyze to yield hso5 anion and then rapidly transform to h2o2 and s2o8 2 anion onto cufes2 surface to further validate the above analysis and provide direct evidence for the generation of h2o2 in the ps cufes2 reaction system the h2o2 was monitored via the ion chromatography ic method huang et al 2020b song et al 2017 as evidenced by the uv spectra recorded fig s6 an observable characteristic peak of h2o2 was appeared at 210 nm after a 120 min reaction time in the ps cufes2 system which further implied the formation of oh radicals were through the stepwise hydrolysis of ps on cufes2 surface to form h2o2 the dos diagram of h2o2 absorbed onto cufes2 was computed as well fig 4e which showed that the lumo energy of h2o2 also corresponded well to the cb of cufes2 this indicates that h2o2 activation by cufes2 also follows the photo assisted reductive cleavage of o o bonds as ps does eq 7 3 4 3 tce degradation pathways in ps cufes2 system to investigate the tce mineralization extent achieved by the ps cufes2 reaction system the total organic carbon toc removal rate was analyzed and calculated as khan et al 2020 m i n e r a l i z t i o n 100 t o c i n i t i a l t o c f i n a l t o c i n i t i a l as displayed in fig s7 a toc concentration of 2 08 mg l and a toc removal efficiency of 40 4 were obtained after 120 min reaction period respectively indicating that certain intermediates of tce were generated in the tce degradation process to clarify the degradation pathways of tce in the ps cufes2 system the intermediate products of tce were investigated by liquid chromatography lc ms and two transformation products were identified in figs 5 a and 5b the molecular structure and formula of the reaction intermediates were displayed in table s3 which are different from tce dehalogenation by sulfide modified nanoscale zero valent iron activated persulfate with formic acid as the only identified byproduct dong et al 2019 in other studies pham et al 2008 and 2009 yuan et al 2014 dichloroacetic acid glyoxylic acid formic acid oxalic acid and co2 were found as the primary transformation intermediates after tce oxidized by oh radicals the different detection methods applied for transformation products identification and the experimental conditions could cause discrepancies in identified intermediates in various studies to further illustrate the tce degradation pathways the gaussian 16 package was employed to compute the gibbs free energy of multiple homogeneous tce oxidation reactions reported in previous studies dong et al 2019 pham et al 2008 based on the identified transformation products and theoretical computations the possible tce degradation pathways emphasizing the role of oh radicals were proposed and displayed in fig 5c briefly in the initial step both so4 and oh radicals were added to the carbon carbon double bond of tce to form carbon centered radical intermediates afterwards these unstable intermediates were further attacked by the oh radicals closely followed by a series of thermodynamically favorable hydrolysis reactions chlorine atoms elimination and dehydration processes to form glyoxylic acids eventually these organic acids were further oxidized to oxalic acids by oh via hydrogen abstraction and then transformed to co2 and h2o as the final products 4 conclusions in this study the cu i fe iii mixed redox couple involved cufes2 150 mg l nps showed high activity toward activating ps 3 0 mm and resulted in 96 of tce degradation at ph 6 8 within 120 min the mechanisms of ps activation by cufes2 and the routes for ros generation were revealed from multiple aspects including batch degradation tests scavenging experiments esr assays dft calculation and tce degradation intermediates analysis these results reasonably explained why tce removal was enhanced under visible light irradiation and the critical roles of cu i fe iii in cufes2 during the ps activation process the so4 radicals were formed through photoexcited electron induced reductive cleavage of o o bond in ps with cu i acted as an electron donor to transfer electron to fe iii then fe iii served as an electron transfer bridge as well as the catalytic center to further donate the received electron to the o o bond of ps the h2o2 generated from ps hydrolysis on the cufes2 surface is the direct pathway of producing oh radicals which were stemmed from the s2o8 2 anion was hydrolyzed to generate h2o2 and then h2o2 was further converted to oh radicals via the photo assisted reductive cleavage of o o bond to the best of our knowledge this is the first report for elucidating the origin of oh radicals induced by the ps cufes2 system under anaerobic and acidic aqueous solutions which may provide a new perspective on ps activation in addition the ps cufes2 system can degrade tce efficiently in the presence of ions and natural organic matter water matrices showing its great potential for practical application furthermore the possible tce degradation pathways in the ps cufes2 oxidation system were proposed this work

15680,persulfate ps s2o8 2 activation through transition metal sulfides tms has gained increasing attention since it can decompose a wide variety of refractory halogenated organic compounds in groundwater and wastewater however the processes of ps activation by tms and particularly the formation of oh radical under anoxic and acidic conditions ph 2 8 remain elusive herein by employing mixed redox couple involved chalcopyrite cufes2 150 mg l nanoparticles for ps 3 0 mm activation 96 of trichloroethylene was degraded within 120 min at ph 6 8 under visible light irradiation the combination of experimental studies and theoretical calculations suggested that the cu i fe iii mixed redox couple in cufes2 plays a crucial role to activate ps cu i acted as an electron donor to transfer electron to fe iii then fe iii served as an electron transfer bridge as well as a catalytic center to further donate this received electron to the o o bond of ps thus yielding so4 for trichloroethylene oxidation moreover for the first time oh radicals were found to form from the catalytic hydrolysis of ps onto cufes2 surface where s2o8 2 anion was hydrolyzed to yield h2o2 and these ensuing h2o2 were further transformed into oh radicals via photoelectron assisted o o bond cleavage step our findings offer valuable insights for understanding the mechanisms of ps activation by redox

introduction groundwater is the vital water source for agricultural irrigation and drinking water accounting for approximately 22 to 30 of worldwide freshwater foster and chilton 2003 giordano 2009 nonetheless as the groundwater aquifers contamination increases the supply demand contradiction of clean groundwater resources becomes noteworthy chlorinated organic contaminants cocs such as trichloroethylene tce are widely used as household and consumer products and persistent in the environment moran et al 2007 rangan et al 2020 due to their illegal dumping and accidental leakage from the ground storage tanks lien et al 2016 cocs have become a category of frequently detected organic pollutants in groundwater stroo et al 2012 it is reported that cocs have contaminated over 125 000 sites in the united state level above the cleanup goals entwistle et al 2019 and their source concentrations moran et al 2007 are often several orders of magnitude higher than the maximum contaminant levels i e 5 μg l established for drinking water usepa 2018 the uptake of cocs from water or food chain can result in chronic and acute human health problems including liver and kidney damage reduced fertility childhood leukaemia spontaneous abortions and cancer mao et al 2012 teel et al 2001 etc to remediate cocs contaminated waters and soils significant efforts have been devoted to developing novel remediation technologies via different physical or biochemical approaches over the past three decades among all the state of the art remediation techniques persulfate ps s2o8 2 based advanced oxidation technology has been recognized as one of the most splendid techniques that offer an effective way for a wide range of in situ recalcitrant organic pollutants attenuation in soil and groundwater huang et al 2019 li et al 2018 liu et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 compared with the conventionally used chemical oxidant hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ps is relatively stable and therefore can be delivered to subsurface contaminated zone with a longer transport distance and larger remediation area resulting in a higher utilization efficiency in groundwater remediation xiao et al 2020 moreover ps has shown the highest reaction stoichiometric efficiency rse among the frequently reported oxidants in aops the rse is defined as the number of moles of probe degraded over the number of moles of ps consumed for example ps activated with iron powder showed rse value below 5 ghauch and ayoub 2014 ghauch et al 2013 while if fe is employed in mof and used as a catalyst the rse value reached up to 30 40 asmar et al 2021 furthermore uv254 activation reached a rse value of 55 hakim et al 2020 and thermal activation showed even greater rse value up to 60 baalbaki et al 2018 furthermore the convenient storage and lower price of ps can further reduce the practical environmental engineering cost lee et al 2020 with ps as the oxidant there are two general ways of activating s2o8 2 anion to produce reactive oxygen species ros including homolysis of the peroxide bond o o using heat or light eq 1 and via a redox process with transition metals mn as electron donors in either homogeneous or heterogeneous media eq 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 ayoub and ghauch 2014 ghauch et al 2017 naim and ghauch 2016 waldemer et al 2007 wang and wang 2018 once s2o8 2 anion is activated the chain reactions producing other ros will be initiated to oxidize organic pollutants more quickly and deeply than ps directly does for in situ applications recent attention has been mainly dedicated to ps activation based on eq 2 since it shows higher efficiency and requires no external equipment supply as well as constant energy input luo et al 2021 oh and lim 2019 1 s 2 o 8 2 h e a t o r h v 2 s o 4

available coughlan et al 2017 li et al 2021a moreover compared to other commonly used transition metal oxides tms show better electrical conductivity robust reduction reactivity and superior optical characteristics sandroni et al 2017 chalcopyrite cufes2 as one of such conspicuous tms that made up of cu i fe iii mixed redox couple ge et al 2020 where two metal cations with opposite redox properties are connected via a nonmetal anion within its crystal structure has attracted growing attention and been used as an efficient oxidant activator for dyes silveira et al 2020 huang et al

remediation it is barely explored for the activation of ps towards cocs degradation furthermore the activation mechanism of cufes2 mediated chemical oxidants decomposition especially the specific catalytic active sites between the mixed redox couple for o o bond dissociation via one electron transfer process down to atomic scale remains unclear meanwhile in addition to so4 radical increased evidence yang et al 2020 yuan et al 2014 suggested the prominent role of oh radical in ps aops for organic pollutants degradation but the routes of oh radical formation especially under acidic and anoxic conditions are still quite limited herein for the first time we employed cufes2 to activate ps towarded the degradation of tce a representative cocs frequently prevalent in contaminated groundwater the core objectives of this study were i to examine the potential of employing cufes2 to activate ps towards tce degradation under visible light irradiation ii to explore the underlying activation mechanisms involved in the ps cufes2 system and the specific roles of cu i fe iii mixed redox couple in cufes2 for radicals formation and iii to elucidate the possible degradation pathways of tce in the ps cufes2 reaction system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials all the chemicals text s1 in the supporting information were used as received without extra purification ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was purged with n2 for 30 min before being used for solution preparation the chalcopyrite nanoparticles nps were prepared through a modified chemical colloidal synthesis approach vaure et al 2018 and materials characterization details were given in text s2 2 2 experimental procedures all the batch tests were performed in borosilicate glass vials containing 30 ml aqueous solution of tce under led lamp illumination 1 72 mw cm2 30 w unless otherwise mentioned the initial concentration of tce was 0 15 mm which is a typical tce level in contaminated groundwater lo et al 2006 and a commonly used experimental concentration gu et al 2018 shan et al 2020 yan et al 2016 in transition metal based aop studies the initial ph of the reaction solution was adjusted to 6 8 0 2 by using 0 1 m h2so4 or naoh and was not controlled during the degradation process a specific amount of cufes2 nps was well dispersed into the tce solution and the suspension was mechanically stirred for 60 min to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium the preliminary experiments revealed that 60 min was enough to achieve the adsorption equilibrium then a 0 1 ml of solution sample was withdrawn from the vials to determine the concentration the obtained tce concentration was used as the initial concentration c0 for the sequent degradation experiments subsequently a desired dose of ps was added into the suspension to trigger the reaction the molar ratio of ps to tce was 20 1 aliquots were taken out from the vials at predetermined time intervals and quenched by adding 2 0 ml methanol immediately then filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter the details of the experimental procedures tce concentration analytical methods scavenger tests and electron spin resonance esr for ros analysis were summarized in text s3 and text s4 of the supporting information respectively furthermore tests were also conducted in actual groundwater samples to investigate the performance of the ps cufes2 system for tce degradation in real environment water the groundwater samples were collected from a local groundwater observation well in shenzhen guangdong province e 114 4 n 22 7 and the physicochemical properties of the natural groundwater were listed in table s1 a specific amount of tce stock solution was added to the groundwater sample as the initial tce concentration 0 15 mm before degradation experiments all the above mentioned batch experiments were performed at least triplicate to ensure the reproducibility of experimental results within the errors 5 of the experiments the average values with standard errors were reported 2 3 computational methods the electronic structure of ps and h2o2 adsorbed cufes2 structure catalytic hydrolysis pathways of ps and tce degradation pathways were conducted through vienna ab inito simulation package vasp kresse and furthmüller 1996a 1996b kresse and hafner 1993 cp2k kühne et al 2020 and gaussian 16 package frisch et al 2016 respectively multiwfn lu and chen 2012 was used for cp2k input file generation vaspkit wang et al 2021 was used for vasp post analysis the details of all the calculations were illustrated in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cufes2 nps the crystalline structures of the as synthesized chalcopyrite nps were analyzed with powder x ray diffraction pxrd compared with the pxrd patterns from standard material fig s1a noticeable multiple sharp diffraction peaks located at 2θ of 29 3 33 8 48 76 49 2 and 57 7 confirmed the synthesized nps were dominated with the chalcopyrite phase cufes2 with jcpds no 37 0471 bright field transmission electron microscope tem image showed that the cufes2 nps were crystallized quasi isotropic shape fig s1c with an average size range of 20 25 nm based on the statistic histogram of the size distribution fig s1b in addition the observed lattice fringe in the high resolution tem image in fig s1d is of a d spacing value of 0 304 nm corresponding well to the lattice spacing of 112 lattice plane which double confirmed the as synthesized nps were the tetragonal phase cufes2 in this structure the typical cu i fe iii mixed redox couple is involved in the crystal structure the high angle annular dark field haadf scanning transmission electron microscopy stem image and stem energy dispersive spectrometer eds images validated fe cu and s were uniformly distributed throughout the as synthesized cufes2 nps figs s1 e h overall these results suggest that cufes2 nps were successfully synthesized in the present study the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra uv vis drs were performed to investigate the optical absorption capability of the cufes2 nps as displayed in fig s2 the estimated optical band gap energy eg value of the cufes2 sample was approximately 1 05 ev according to the plot of αhν 2 as a function of photo energy hν using tauc s equation tauc et al 1966 which suggests that cufes2 is a semiconducting material with light responsible range covers from visible light to near infrared light range 3 2 degradation performance of tce in ps cufes2 system in this study the directly oxidized by ps or adsorbed onto cufes2 nps alone can result in tce elimination therefore except for investigating tce degradation in the ps cufes2 system tce removal tests by ps and cufes2 nps were also evaluated individually additionally to determine the tce loss due to its volatilization during the reaction a control test was conducted under identical conditions without adding cufes2 activator or ps as shown in fig 1 a tce was fast removed by the ps cufes2 system and more than 96 of tce was degraded within 120 min meanwhile only about 29 3 fig 1b and 9 3 fig 1c of tce were directly removed by 150 mg l of cufes2 and 3 0 mm of ps alone indicating a synergistic effect on tce degradation was achieved by combining cufes2 activator and ps oxidant and their interaction is the primary source for ros generation the performance of tce degradation under dark conditions the reaction vials were covered by aluminum foil was also explored fig 1a shows the tce degradation efficiencies 87 9 were lower than those under visible light irradiation suggesting the promoted role of visible light for tce degradation in the ps cufes2 oxidation system this phenomenon could be due to the narrow band semiconducting nature of cufes2 where the visible light induced the increased amounts of generated photoelectrons transfer from cufes2 to o o bond of ps thus facilitating the o o bonds scission and higher concentration of ros formation for tce oxidation to optimize tce degradation in the ps cufes2 system the dosage effects of cufes2 and ps on tce degradation were investigated individually fig 2 a displays the tce degradation performance with different dosages of cufes2 nps with fixed ps concentration 3 0 mm when the dosage of cufes2 increased from 75 mg l to 150 mg l the degradation rate of tce was accelerated and the final degradation efficiency after 120 min increased to 96 8 accordingly a higher dosage of cufes2 suspended particles could offer more active sites for ps activation so a faster removal of tce was achieved by the elevated levels of ros however further increasing the dosage of cufes2 to 300 mg l had less benefit to tce degradation the higher amount of cufes2 could result in more cufes2 nps aggregation and block out more visible light ji et al 2021 yang et al 2021 after fixing cufes2 dosage at 150 mg l the degradation rate of tce increased with ps concentration increasing from 1 5 to 3 0 mm after which tce degradation significantly decreased fig 2b since ps is the radical donor an appropriate increase of ps concentration can improve tce degradation as more ros were generated and reacted with tce however excessive ps ps 0 4 5 mm would also act as radicals sink which competed with tce for reaction as described by eq 3 liang et al 2007 yang et al 2020 and thus resulted in a lower tce degradation efficiency 3 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 s o 4 2 the corresponding kinetic calculations were studied by using a pseudo first order kinetic model as shown in the following equation ln c c 0 kt where k min 1 is the reaction rate constant and c 0 as well as c represent tce concentrations at time t 0 and t min respectively as seen in figs 2c and 2d the experimental results fitted well with the first order kinetics and the rate constant k achieved the highest value at 150 mg l cufes2 and 3 0 mm ps respectively to sum up the tce degradation efficiency can be enhanced by the appropriately increased amount of cufes2 and ps since the maximum ros yield depends on the optimal concentrations of cufes2 and ps further the calculated rse was 4 84 under this optimized reaction condition which is comparable to that of rse obtained in other researchers work when using fe based materials as the ps activator ghauch and ayoub 2014 ghauch et al 2013 and much higher than those reported rse values in h2o2 based in situ chemical oxidation 0 28 jia et al 2018 pham et al 2012 in addition a comparative study for tce degradation by ps activated with various transition metal based activators reported in the literature is presented in table s2 it was found that the tce activator mg mg for the cufes2 was much higher than those of other transition metal based activators which exhibits the superiority of cufes2 compared to other conventional transition metal based activators and proves that the cufes2 nps is a promising candidate for ps activation towards tce degradation the release amount of generated chloride ions cl in the solution in parallel with tce degradation in the ps cufes2 reaction system was monitored theoretically 3 0 mm of cl ions will be released from the complete dichlorination process of 1 0 mm of tce i e 15 98 mg l cl ions in total will be liberated from 20 mg l of tce therefore based on the remaining concentrations of tce in presented in fig 1a the theoretical yields of cl ions at 5 15 30 60 and 120 min should be 10 77 13 94 15 07 15 25 and 15 47 mg l respectively however as shown in fig s3 the determined concentrations of cl ions in solution were 7 07 11 63 12 75 12 81 and 13 18 mg l respectively the gap between the detected cl and the theoretical cl ions suggests that tce was partially degraded and chlorinated intermediates were formed during the 120 min reaction time the practical application potential of the ps cufes2 system for actual groundwater remediation was evaluated and shown in fig s4 compared with the results in ultrapure water when groundwater was used as a background solution the inhibition effect was visible probably attributed to the co existent ions and dissolved organic molecules in the natural groundwater sample dong et al 2019 hakim et al 2019 2020 huang et al 2019 although the tce degradation rate was suppressed the final tce degradation efficiency still reached 90 indicating the real application prospects of this ps cufes2 system for groundwater remediation since the concentrations of the dissolved fe and cu ions from cufes2 nps after a 120 min reaction were about 14 mg l and 34 mg l data not shown respectively the control experiments with the co existent of fe3 and cu2 ions for homogeneously ps activation toward tce degradation were explored as seen in fig s5 the tce degradation efficiency in 120 min was about 9 0 which is comparable to the tce removal efficiency by ps alone indicating that the homogeneous leached fe and cu ions have minor effects on tce degradation while the degradation was mainly attributed to the heterogeneous ps activation process 3 3 identification of ros in ps cufes2 system for the degradation of organic contaminants by transition metals activated ps so4 is usually assumed as the dominant radical nevertheless the role of oh in activated ps process has recently been recognized and was experimentally validated to be even more pronounced than that of so4 for organic pollutants oxidation ahmad et al 2012 yuan et al 2014 therefore excessive tertiary butyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were separately added to the reaction solution to identify the contribution of intermediated reactive species to tce oxidation in the ps cufes2 system in comparison to the controlled experiments without scavenger the degradation efficiency of tce after 120 min was significantly inhibited by adding meoh and tba which were respectively 32 7 k 3 83 10 3 min 1 and 43 9 k 4 52 10 3 min 1 as displayed in fig 3 a the relatively higher inhibition of tce degradation efficiency with meoh revealed that both so4 and oh radicals were produced and contributed to tce degradation while oh was relatively more pronounced than so4 in the ps cufes2 system to further identify the presence of ros and explain the degradation mechanisms in the ps cufes2 system the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo trapped electron spin resonance esr spectra of the reaction solution were recorded fig 3b shows the esr spectrum of ps and ps cufes2 no characteristic peaks were identified in dmpo and ps alone system implying that no radical was produced without the cufes2 activator when ps was added together with cufes2 and dmpo typical and intense esr signals of dmpo oh adducts four fold characteristic 1 2 2 1 peak and relatively weak esr signals of dmpo so4 adducts six peak spectrum were detected suggesting both oh and so4 radicals were presented moreover the peak intensity of dmpo so4 adducts was much weaker in comparison with that of dmpo oh adducts implying that the concentration of so4 was lower than oh which was consistent with the radical quenching experiments in addition the signal of dmpo so4 slightly decreased as the reaction time progressed while the peak of dmpo oh adduct increased obviously from 1 to 5 min showing that numerous oh were persistently produced to sum up based on the results of esr spectra and scavenger tests oh radical rather than so4 radical was predominantly produced during the heterogeneous cufes2 activated ps process 3 4 insights into ps activation mechanism by cufes2 3 4 1 role of cu fe and s species in ps activation xps analysis was applied to determine the chemical environments of all three elements and compare the difference of cufes2 nps before and after the reaction as seen in fig 3c the survey scan of fresh and used cufes2 manifest the presence of cu 2p fe 2p s 2p and o 1 s for fresh cufes2 the positions of cu 2p3 2 peaks fig 3d were respectively 931 92 ev and 933 17 ev where both corresponded to cu i xu et al 2019 also the cu 2p1 2 peak at 952 53 ev was attributed to cu i species deen and asselin 2016 no cu 2p3 2 shake up satellite peak associated with cu ii was observed three peaks of fe 2p3 2 fig 3e were occurred at 707 78 ev 710 78 ev and 713 67 ev respectively the former two peaks corresponded well to fe iii s and fe iii o brrion 1980 while the last peak 713 67 ev may reflect the signal of surface unsaturated fe iii that bonded to less s ii than bulk fe iii andersson et al 2004 schiros et al 2010 von oertzen et al 2006 the two different positions of s species in fig 3f 161 10 ev and 162 23 ev were both corresponded to s 2p3 2 which represented the signals of monosulfide s2 and disulfide s2 2 ghahremaninezhad et al 2013 respectively additionally the peak that appeared at 163 73 ev has corresponded to polysulfide sn 2 n 2 species the peak for o 1 s occurred at 531 7 ev could be due to the possible air oxidation of the as prepared cufes2 nps compared to the xps spectra of fresh cufes2 nps the peak positions of different elements were almost the same after the reaction but with varied proportions especially for cu and fe after reaction the proportion of cu i decreased from 24 4 to 18 0 while fe iii increased from 27 4 to 33 8 the s ii proportion was almost unchanged from 48 3 to 48 2 these results indicate that both cu and fe participated in activating ps via electron transfer however noting that there was no signal of fe ii and cu ii in the xps spectra this phenomenon was not able to be illustrated by the redox potentials of fe iii fe ii 0 77 ev vs she and cu ii cu i 0 159 ev vs she couples in aqueous solutions therefore the density of state dos calculations were performed to give an in depth insight into the mechanisms of ps activation by cufes2 nps and the details were discussed in the subsequent sections the mechanism of single electron transfer induced reductive cleavage of o o in peroxide through eqs 1 and 2 were commonly reported to elucidate the activation mechanism in ps based heterogeneous advanced oxidation process ps aop liu et al 2014 oh et al 2016 tang et al 2020 wang and wang 2018 whereby an electron flows from the transition metal based activator into the o o bond of peroxide and then induces its cleavage when using a photo sensitive transition metal based material as an activator the single electron transfer reduction process could be accelerated upon visible light absorption because the photoexcited electrons in the conduction band cb of the semiconductive activator have higher energy levels than the valence band vb to reduce ps and thus to make its o o bond cleavage easier to further elucidate the inherent role of cu fe and s of cufes2 for this photo assisted reductive cleavage of o o bond in ps the dos analysis was employed to investigate the electronic structure of s2o8 2 anions adsorbed onto cufes2 surface with vasp kresse and furthmiiller 1996 kresse and furthmü 1996 kresse and hafner 1993 as shown in fig 4 a the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy of ps corresponds well to the cb of cufes2 indicating the probable electron transfer from cufes2 cb to ps lumo thus leading to the reduction and o o bond cleavage process of ps the dos diagram also reveals the function of three elements of cufes2 during ps activation the vb of cufes2 was mainly composed of the cu 3d and s 3p orbitals while its cb was primarily occupied by the fe 3d orbitals suggesting that the metal metal charge transfer eq 4 from cu to fe and ligand metal charge transfer eq 5 from s to fe processes would be favorable to take place during visible light irradiation miessler et al 2013 in other words both cu i and s ii could act as electron donors during visible light excitation while cu i is more likely to be the predominant electron donor since the electron configuration of cu ii s ii is more thermodynamically stable than that of cu i s i meanwhile fe iii could act as an electron transfer bridge as well as the catalytic center which accepted the photoexcited electron from cu and s temporarily transformed into fe ii then directly reduced s2o8 2 anion to ros with the received photoelectron and converted back to fe iii as shown in fig 4b and eq 6 4 fe iii s ii cu i heat or hv fe ii e h ν s ii cu ii h 5 fe iii s ii cu i heat or hv fe ii e h ν s i h cu i fe

commonly recognized mechanisms for the routes of oh radicals formation including oxygen molecular reduction by photoelectron eq 8 deng et al 2021 fang et al 2013 keenan and sedlak 2008a and 2008b li et al 2019 water oxidation by photogenerated holes eq 9 tang et al 2020 and hydrolysis of so4 under alkaline and neutral conditions eqs 10 and 11 furman et al 2010 liang and su 2009 wang and zhang 2018 since the tce degradation tests were performed under oxygen free conditions so the main pathway of oh radicals formation via the oxygen reduction route can be ruled out in addition the reported vb maximum of cufes2 0 88 v vs she schoonen and xu 2000 is much lower than the standard redox potential for oh h h2o couple 2 8 v vs she wang and zhang 2018 at ph 7 so the generation of oh radicals via direct oxidation of h2o by photoexcited holes in cufes2 vb is not thermodynamically favorable previous reports furman et al 2010 liang et al 2007 liang and su 2009 have shown that oh could be generated through the reaction of so4 with h2o at a very low rate kso4 h2o 2 103 s 1 while the conversion of so4 into oh become increasingly noticeable under alkaline conditions ph 8 5 due to the higher reaction rate of so4 with oh kso4 oh 6 5 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 since the tce degradation reactions started at the neutral condition ph initial 6 8 and quickly dropped to 2 8 within 5 min and kept constant after reaction data not shown the alkaline hydrolysis of so4 would not be able to occur also the reaction between so4 and h2o would not be the possible dominant route for oh radicals formation because the reaction rate appears to be less significant under all ph conditions this implies that the accumulation of oh radicals during the reaction was generated via other pathways instead of the three possible routes mentioned above the oh is more likely to be generated from the hydrolysis of s2o8 2 anion which is a two step process with hydroperoxoymonosulfate anion hso5 as the transient intermediate eqs 12 and 13 hayon et al 1972 usually the hydrolysis of s2o8 2 anion to produce hso5 anion will not occur at room temperature due to the high activation energy which was 32 kcal mol 1 under neutral conditions and 26 kcal mol 1 under acidic conditions hayon et al 1972 respectively to compare the reaction pathways and transition states of uncatalyzed and catalyzed ps hydrolysis onto cufes2 surface the gfn1 xtb method and ci neb algorithm with cp2k package goedecker et al 1996 lippert et al 1997 perdew et al 1996 were conducted the computation results revealed that the ps hydrolysis processes would be permissible to take place with the involvement of cufes2 as seen from the electron energy diagrams in figs 4c and 4d interestingly in both elementary hydrolysis steps the transition state energies of the adsorbed ps onto cufes2 surface were significantly lower than the homogenous ones without cufes2 involvement which were respectively lowered by 17 2 kcal mol 1 and 20 8 kcal mol 1 the lower activation energy makes s2o8 2 anion able to hydrolyze to yield hso5 anion and then rapidly transform to h2o2 and s2o8 2 anion onto cufes2 surface to further validate the above analysis and provide direct evidence for the generation of h2o2 in the ps cufes2 reaction system the h2o2 was monitored via the ion chromatography ic method huang et al 2020b song et al 2017 as evidenced by the uv spectra recorded fig s6 an observable characteristic peak of h2o2 was appeared at 210 nm after a 120 min reaction time in the ps cufes2 system which further implied the formation of oh radicals were through the stepwise hydrolysis of ps on cufes2 surface to form h2o2 the dos diagram of h2o2 absorbed onto cufes2 was computed as well fig 4e which showed that the lumo energy of h2o2 also corresponded well to the cb of cufes2 this indicates that h2o2 activation by cufes2 also follows the photo assisted reductive cleavage of o o bonds as ps does eq 7 3 4 3 tce degradation pathways in ps cufes2 system to investigate the tce mineralization extent achieved by the ps cufes2 reaction system the total organic carbon toc removal rate was analyzed and calculated as khan et al 2020 m i n e r a l i z t i o n 100 t o c i n i t i a l t o c f i n a l t o c i n i t i a l as displayed in fig s7 a toc concentration of 2 08 mg l and a toc removal efficiency of 40 4 were obtained after 120 min reaction period respectively indicating that certain intermediates of tce were generated in the tce degradation process to clarify the degradation pathways of tce in the ps cufes2 system the intermediate products of tce were investigated by liquid chromatography lc ms and two transformation products were identified in figs 5 a and 5b the molecular structure and formula of the reaction intermediates were displayed in table s3 which are different from tce dehalogenation by sulfide modified nanoscale zero valent iron activated persulfate with formic acid as the only identified byproduct dong et al 2019 in other studies pham et al 2008 and 2009 yuan et al 2014 dichloroacetic acid glyoxylic acid formic acid oxalic acid and co2 were found as the primary transformation intermediates after tce oxidized by oh radicals the different detection methods applied for transformation products identification and the experimental conditions could cause discrepancies in identified intermediates in various studies to further illustrate the tce degradation pathways the gaussian 16 package was employed to compute the gibbs free energy of multiple homogeneous tce oxidation reactions reported in previous studies dong et al 2019 pham et al 2008 based on the identified transformation products and theoretical computations the possible tce degradation pathways emphasizing the role of oh radicals were proposed and displayed in fig 5c briefly in the initial step both so4 and oh radicals were added to the carbon carbon double bond of tce to form carbon centered radical intermediates afterwards these unstable intermediates were further attacked by the oh radicals closely followed by a series of thermodynamically favorable hydrolysis reactions chlorine atoms elimination and dehydration processes to form glyoxylic acids eventually these organic acids were further oxidized to oxalic acids by oh via hydrogen abstraction and then transformed to co2 and h2o as the final products 4 conclusions in this study the cu i fe iii mixed redox couple involved cufes2 150 mg l nps showed high activity toward activating ps 3 0 mm and resulted in 96 of tce degradation at ph 6 8 within 120 min the mechanisms of ps activation by cufes2 and the routes for ros generation were revealed from multiple aspects including batch degradation tests scavenging experiments esr assays dft calculation and tce degradation intermediates analysis these results reasonably explained why tce removal was enhanced under visible light irradiation and the critical roles of cu i fe iii in cufes2 during the ps activation process the so4 radicals were formed through photoexcited electron induced reductive cleavage of o o bond in ps with cu i acted as an electron donor to transfer electron to fe iii then fe iii served as an electron transfer bridge as well as the catalytic center to further donate the received electron to the o o bond of ps the h2o2 generated from ps hydrolysis on the cufes2 surface is the direct pathway of producing oh radicals which were stemmed from the s2o8 2 anion was hydrolyzed to generate h2o2 and then h2o2 was further converted to oh radicals via the photo assisted reductive cleavage of o o bond to the best of our knowledge this is the first report for elucidating the origin of oh radicals induced by the ps cufes2 system under anaerobic and acidic aqueous solutions which may provide a new perspective on ps activation in addition the ps cufes2 system can degrade tce efficiently in the presence of ions and natural organic matter water matrices showing its great potential for practical application furthermore the possible tce degradation pathways in the ps cufes2 oxidation system were proposed this work offers a deeper understanding of the ps activation process as well as the generation of oh radicals under anoxic and acidic conditions which sheds light on the rational design of promising tms based activator towards ps activation for halogenated organic pollutants removal in the environment authors contribution j h and y z contributed equally declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15681,planktonic invasive species cause adverse effects on aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem services however these impacts are often underestimated because of unresolved taxonomic issues and limited biogeographic knowledge thus it is pivotal to start a rigorous quantification of impacts undertaken by planktonic invasive species on global economies we used the invacost database the most up to date database of economic cost estimates of biological invasions worldwide to produce the first critical assessment of the economic dimension of biological invasions caused by planktonic taxa we found that in period spanning from 1960 to 2021 the cumulative global cost of plankton invasions was us 5 8 billion for permanent plankton holoplankton of which viruses encompassed nearly 93 apart from viruses we found more costs related to zooplankton us 297 million than to the other groups summed including myco us 73 million phyto 43 million and bacterioplankton us 0 7 million strikingly harmful and potentially toxic cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates are completely absent from the database furthermore the data base showed a decrease in costs over time which is probably an artifact as a sharp rise of novel planktonic alien species has gained international attention also assessments of the costs of larval meroplanktonic stages of littoral and benthic invasive invertebrates are lacking whereas cumulative global cost of their adults stages is high up to us 98 billion billion and increasing considering the challenges and perspectives of increasing but unnoticed or neglected impacts by plankton invasions the assessment of their ecological and economic impacts should be of high priority graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords alien plankton ecosystem services invacost monetary loss non native pelagic invaders data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction invasion scientists managers and stakeholders have reported high and rising impacts of invasive species on ecosystems and economies worldwide bellard et al 2016 diagne et al 2021a cuthbert et al 2021 in an economically connected world a more comprehensive assessment of the geographic description and quantification of invasion impacts has been emphasized for the efficient and sustainable management of invasive taxa and invaded habitats ricciardi et al 2020 haubrock et al 2022b the economic burden exhibit more rapid increase in regions historically underappreciated by the invasion science e g africa haubrock et al 2022b and concerns about protected areas rico sánchez et al 2021 yet the invasive taxa and the magnitude and distribution of their costs are unevenly reported across types of environments and ecosystems with the aquatic invasive species being the most underrepresented when compared to the terrestrial invaders cuthbert et al 2021 hence costs of aquatic invasions may be disproportionately low due to a mismatch between high number of non native species and much lower impact assessments crystal ornelas and lockwood 2020 cuthbert et al 2021 2022 aquatic invaders are continuously proliferating as result of the global transport of goods notable by ballast water e g casas monroy et al 2015 bailey et al 2015 ricciardi and macisaac 2022 and the electronic commerce olden et al 2021 accelerated over the course of the covid 19 pandemic bhatti et al 2020 more recently global attention has also shifted towards climate driven range extensions and to anthropogenic environmental changes making recipients habitats more susceptible to invasions bellard et al 2016 seebens et al 2020 macêdo et al 2021 2022 likely the abundant planktonic invaders including meroplankton early planktonic stages of organism with a non planktonic adult life form show high propagule pressure colonizing new interconnected aquatic environments e g czerniawski and krepski 2021 therefore there has been an appeal to expand our understanding of the impacts of biological invasions at different biological organization levels crystal ornelas and lockwood 2020 and through an interdisciplinary context ricciardi et al 2020 diagne et al 2020a b this lack of knowledge is a major concern when it comes to the pelagic habitats considering planktonic organisms which themselves have many features that remain primarily overlooked worldwide e g abundance diversity and distribution jeppesen et al 2011 chust et al 2017 garcía chicote et al 2018 planktonic organisms have a pivotal ecological role in both marine and inland waters where they dictate biogeochemical cycles and mediate energy flow kerfoot et al 1988 armengol et al 2019 naselli flores and padisák 2022 in addition to the strong and complex trophic links that characterize planktonic relationships high diversity of taxa living forms and stages the interplays between holo vs meroplankton in the vertical transport of nutrients novel ecological outcomes can emerge from the examination of non native planktonic species within native communities and from the context dependency of their impacts to date invasive plankton impact evaluations are scarce or are biased towards few taxa that caused impacts in developed counties dexter and bollens 2019 or toward laboratory experiments with limiting extrapolation power e g oliveira et al 2019 but see dexter and bollens 2020a 2020b despite the paucity of evidence some impacts have been related to plankton invasions human health through toxin release or parasite hosting ito and olesen 2017 water quality deterioration from indirect changes in habitat conditions e g turbidity walsh et al 2016 massive fish kills through oxygen depletion and histological damage and bottom up disruptions of trophic relationships amorim and moura 2020 pacheco et al 2021 gonzález madina et al 2021 at present we assume that knowledge gaps on the economic costs of plankton invasions may be a result of the considerable underestimation of their destructive potential especially if we consider indirect effects and assessment limitations using the invacost database diagne et al 2020b we address the following questions to understand the current economic dimension of this problem 1 what are the documented economic costs of invasive planktonic species globally 2 how do these costs change over time and how are they distributed among main economic activities 3 what are the costliest invasive species among them all also we discuss the expected gaps of knowledge on meroplanktonic stages and its implications for costly negative effects in the planktonic habitat and of their adult stages 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we compared the economic costs of handling invasive holoplanktonic species and organisms with those of meroplanktonic stages using the invacost database the invacost is a comprehensive compilation and description of economic cost estimates of biological invasions worldwide diagne et al 2020a b the database was developed following a systematic and standardized methodology to extract information from scientific articles grey literature stakeholders and expert advertisement all methods and procedures for data search retention extraction validation collation and improvements are available in diagne et al 2020a b we used the most up to date version of invacost version 4 0 doi 10 6084 m9 figshare 12668570 which contains 13 123 cost entries referring to a unique cost value both in local currencies and 2017 us rates there is also a set of specific descriptors of the cost s spatial and temporal information the taxonomy of the invasive species the cost typology the impacted sectors and the document reporting the cost diagne et al 2020a we used a subset of this database focusing on aquatic environments where the costs were estimated and where the invasive species lives independently of where the cost occurred we classified holoplanktonic organisms which fell into the following groups virioplankton dna and rna viruses with few nanometers in diameter bacterioplankton gram negative bacteria belonging to aeromonadaceae family mycoplankton fungi like pathogens especially oomycetes with microscopic filamentous dimension phytoplankton unicellular algae from families raphidophyceae prymnesiaceae and cymbellaceae with dimension 10 45 μm zooplankton platyhelminthes 0 5 1 0 mm branchiopoda cladocera and anostraca with dimensions 10 15mm scyphozoa and ctenophora with dimension 14 18 cm and meroplankton which included animals with early stages in the pelagic zone such as mollusks crustaceans and some insects for a detailed species list see table s1 and the glossary for definitions we extracted all economic costs associated with aquatic organisms filtering the information on the descriptive field environment we checked the data subset to remove any missing data on the economic costs our final databases had 43 entries of holoplanktonic species table s2 and 714 entries of meroplankton table s3 due to the small number of resulting cost information for holoplanktonic species we also included data classified as having low reliability n 8 e g not fully accessible information and as potential implementation n 13 observed or expected through modeling or extrapolations following adelino et al 2021 for meroplanktonic data we instead retained only the costs classified as observed and also those of high reliability column method reliability see diagne et al 2020a for further details for model analyses we used the final subset for meroplanktonic organisms 597 entries we classified the groups according to the typology of the costs they have promoted namely damage loss for economic losses due to the impact of invaders e g infrastructure alteration medical care or damage repair management for economic resources allocated to actions towards avoiding the invasion or dealing with established invaders e g prevention control or eradication mixed when the cost includes both damage and management elements see also vaissière et al 2022 we also categorized data on which societal or market sectors were impacted by each group using data from the impacted sector descriptive field agriculture food and other products produced by human activities through using natural and plant resources from their ecosystems authorities stakeholders governmental services and or official organizations dedicated to management of biological invasions environment impacts on natural resources and or ecosystem services fishery impacts on fisheries and aquaculture health cost related to the sanitary demands of people public and social welfare activities or services related to the human well being at a broader sense such as personal goods or quality of life and mixed when more than a single sector was involved 2 2 data analysis we performed all analyses in r version 4 1 2 r core team 2021 using the invacost r package leroy et al 2020 for analyses and ggplot2 version 3 3 5 wickham 2011 for data visualization we first compared the economic costs reported for each group holo and meroplankton using the above classification scheme then we examined annual variations in economic costs considering that some of the entries in the database described total costs over multiple years we used the function expandyearlycosts to determine the annual costs this function divides the total cost by the number of years and converts it to a cost per year removing entries with an unspecified period in the database we first derived the annual trend of costs caused by planktonic invasive species through the function summarizecosts this function provides a summary of the cumulative costs and the average annual costs of invasive alien species and divides it into regular periods 1970 2020 based on cost estimates as they appeared in the invacost database to estimate and predict the trend of the economic costs of invasive planktonic species over time we fitted models of annual costs using the function modelcosts on the log10 transformed cost estimates per year this function performs different modeling techniques ordinary least squares regressions linear and quadratic robust regressions linear and quadratic generalized additive models gam and other analyses not applied to our data but see diagne et al 2020a we calibrated all models to follow a robust linear regression using cost data as a response variable and time as the predictor considering that our subsets for holo n 43 and meroplankton n 597 are too small to make reliable predictions we used the model approach to detect tendencies for each group in doing so we could subsidize our discussion based on the effects of insufficient data on the perceived threat posed by a group of species 3 results the costs of holoplanktonic species were assessed in 17 countries comprising in north america the united states and mexico central america chile eastern europe bulgaria georgia romania russia turkey and ukraine israel central europe spain and scotland northern europe denmark sweden finland and norway and new zealand our sample included three viruses two fungal like organisms one bacterium four phytoplankton and six zooplankton taxa fig 1 geographical and taxonomic disparities associated with costs were perceived for example a single species caused damages that cost up to us 8 million in new zealand one entry while 8 species in northern europe cost altogether us 149 million fig 1 holoplanktonic taxa listed in the invacost database were from 13 systematic orders excluding viruses estimated costs and brief descriptive notes of their impacts are also provided in table 1 all reported costs were from non urban areas and only one was from a protected island canary islands attributable to artemia franciscana kellogg 1906 anostraca crustacea altogether holoplanktonic invasive species were responsible for costs around us 5 883 billion the majority of the reported cost estimates was associated with damage loss us 5 877 billion rather than management costs us 0 005 billion fig 2 this pattern was consistent across groups except for bacterioplankton which had slightly larger costs directed to manage invasions and or to mitigate their impacts 54 1 virioplankton was the costliest us 5 4 billion group and together with mycoplankton 99 9 had the largest share in damage loss costs the greatest impact of holoplanktonic invasions was on fishery us 5 5 billion with virioplankton being responsible for the majority of the costs followed by phytoplanktonic species fig 2 many impacts were shared among sectors us 317 9 million but all of them included fishery interventions by the public and private sectors authorities stakeholders category were responsible for 54 1 of the costs related to bacterioplankton environmental costs were underrepresented and accounted for less than 1 as associated with zooplankton the estimated global cost of crustaceans 10 taxa insects 2 taxa and molluscans 13 taxa reached us 98 billion mainly attributed to damage loss us 82 billion however none of the cost assessments resulted from impacts caused by their early meroplanktonic stages most costs associated with insecta 89 7 and crustacea 81 9 were also directed to damage loss in contrast the costs related to mollusca were nearly equally attributed to damage loss 55 and mixed 41 8 with the latter being related to control measures mollusks have caused an economic loss of us 16 5 billion mainly spent by authorities and stakeholders us 6 2 billion 37 9 and on public and social welfare us 4 8 billion 28 9 the lowest costs were attributed to crustaceans us 384 million mostly related to the fishery sector 36 3 health expenditures were exclusively related to the insect group us 6 3 billion and represented 7 8 of the total cost caused by this group worldwide us 81 billion the costs of biological invasions of holoplanktonic organisms exponentially increased until the 90s reaching a peak in 1995 and then steadily decreased towards 2020 during this period invasions cost on average us 142 9 million per year figure 3 costs generated by adult taxa with meroplanktonic stages have however exponentially increased with a mean annual cost of us 2 billion the 2000 2010 decade was the costliest reaching us 8 billion of annual costs followed by the 2010 2020 year period where nearly us 6 5 billion were spent per year to deal solely with adults stages although models indicated a quadratic tendency for holoplankton with a decrease in costs from the 2000s forward figure 4 a all modeling techniques confirmed that costs have continuously increased each year since 1970 for adult organisms with meroplanktonic stages figure 4b 4 discussion our global assessment on the economic impacts of plankton invasions identified costs of up to us 5 billion holoplankton between 1960 and 2021 the current economic costs of holoplankton were compiled solely from 16 invasive species here split within virio 3 taxa bacterio 1 myco 2 taxa phyto 4 taxa and zooplankton 6 taxa reported costs with holoplankton were driven mainly by damage loss rather than expenses incurred for management these results are in line with the overall pattern found for the pool of invasive species in invacost database indicating insufficient management and the urgent need to increase spending towards more cost efficient actions particularly pre invasion management cuthbert et al 2022 both fishery and mixed sectors were the most compromised economic sectors respectively caused by microbial pathogens or not clearly distinguished overall costs are likely expected to be underreported as the aforementioned taxa can also account for indirect impacts affecting some overlooked economic sectors e g health environment and public social welfare we illustrated higher costs of invertebrates with meroplanktonic stages us 98 billion crustaceans insects and mollusks however costs of their larval stages are absent in invacost database and studies concerning invasions of meroplanktonic organisms are scarce bollens et al 2002 despite the increasing trend of costs with their adult stages in recent decades we also advocate that meroplanktonic organisms become a target and priority for invasion early warning ernandes silva et al 2016 partly contributing to avoid or minimize the massive negative impact of their adult stages on biodiversity water quality and economies mollusks haubrock et al 2022a insects bradshaw et al 2016 fish haubrock et al 2022b 4 1 geographical distribution of costs we identified an unevenly spatial distribution of costs worldwide with a significant discrepancy between developing and developed countries disproportionately more data on invader impacts are available in the global north bellard and jeschke 2015 bellard et al 2016 dexter and bollens 2019 despite these biased geographical cost estimates plankton costs represent a higher fraction when compared to the total costs for all groups of aquatic and terrestrial alien species of some regional assessments e g italy haubrock et al 2021a méxico rico sánchez et al 2021 and singapore haubrock et al 2021b investments in management of invasive species such as those arising from infectious diseases caused by pathogens mainly viruses and bacteria were also geographically skewed towards north america europe and oceania haubrock et al 2022c although central america and chile showed the highest reported costs exclusively handling viruses in chile and new zealand we found enormous costs associated with a single species of a diatom didymosphenia geminata while northern europe was the only geographical area that had costs with at least one taxon from each of the holoplanktonic groups the lack of reported costs for africa and asia as well as the few entries from north america and oceania are notable however several recent studies have shown raising costs of biological invasions in australia bradshaw et al 2021 china and india liu et al 2021 or southern and eastern africa diagne et al 2021b while these increases may be driven by specific taxonomic groups non planktonic haubrock et al 2022c suggest that regions which previously had lower research effort e g africa exhibit higher asymptotic increase comparable to regions historically at the forefront of invasion research e g united states costs of planktonic invasive species were also scarce or absent in most south american country e g in brazil that harbours a significant portion of natural resources with extensive wetlands groundwater and irrigation systems contradictorily information on the expansion of invasive plankton species in brazil is rising matsumura tundisi and silva 2002 anderson et al 2012 macêdo et al 2020 severiano et al 2022 but the quantification of their associated impacts were never documented 4 2 temporal gaps while cost estimates of holoplankton have been decreasing over time there is an increasing trend with costs of many other groups included in invacost diagne et al 2020a haubrock et al 2022b historically monetary costs of holoplankton introductions started with platyhelminthes gyrodactylus salaris in 1977 while the most recent register was in 2017 for mycoplankton batrachochytrium dendrobatidis there were only two bacterioplankton entries in 2006 and 2009 while phyto and zooplankton costs were observed mainly in the last two decades despite the fact that the harmful effects of algal blooms were recognized as already as the 1970s maso and garces 2006 zingone and enevoldsen 2000 and some reports of impacts by zooplankton were from the early 1980s moller 1984 shiganova et al 2001 there is a delay in bringing taxa invasion to the attention of the broad scientific community and managers this may be in part due to misidentifications e g mesocyclops ogunnus matsumura tundisi and silva 2002 or due to delays in labelling as invasive species extensively reported in a given area e g the case of kellicottia bostoniensis in mexico nandini et al 2022 we assume that the decrease in global economic costs of planktonic species shown in the model estimates to be an artifact because of lack of data and research effort also combining holo and meroplanktonic invasions than holoplankton alone may show a more realistic trend of costs and potential impacts for the pelagic habitats worldwide the slightly decrease in costs during 2010 2020 is a lag time in reporting of costs due to the publishing process 4 3 taxonomic gaps there were only 16 species among holoplanktonic invasive causing costs stressing our plea on the underestimation of their costs worldwide due to a clear taxonomic gap dexter and bollens 2019 in their review on zooplankton invasions pointed out 139 non native holoplanktonic species and approximately half of the surveyed publications concerned solely four species bythotrephes longimanus leydig 1860 mnemioposis leidyi cercopagis pengoi ostroumov 1891 and daphnia lumholtzi absent in the invacost database in addition only 4 3 of the 139 studies informed on their economic impacts also multiple zooplanktonic species have shown much higher non native distributions than previously reported e g pseudodiaptomus forbesi oithona davisae bosmina coregoni kellicottia bostoniensis dexter et al 2020b macêdo et al 2020 similarly phytoplankton was poorly represented in the invacost database with only four taxa listed see table 1 however the european alien species database easin 2022 alone lists around 117 phytoplankton taxa as alien in marine and freshwater environments among them some toxin producing and bloom forming algae these numbers may indicate that less costly species are not less harmful or potentially impactful but probably less studied e g invasive cyanobacteria and microscopic stages of non planktonic invertebrates according to wolf and klaiber 2017 most of the state and local governments of the united states considered harmful algal blooms to be somewhat serious or very serious issues economic losses related to eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms have been addressed in several cases e g dodds et al 2009 wolf and klaiber 2017 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 though in many largely unmeasured or not properly quantified carmichael and boyer 2016 however costs of invasive cyanobacteria are lacking in the invacost database the potential negative impacts and underlying neglected costs of invasive cyanobacteria might be overwhelming and include changes in the abiotic environment and biogeochemical cycles shifts in microbial communities not to mention the effect of single or multiple toxins on biodiversity by acute and sub lethal effects on consumers and potential competitors sukenik et al 2012 sukenik et al 2015 additionally the co occurrence of multiple invasive species kokocinski and soininen 2019 and harmful impacts in freshwaters of remote oceanic islands costa et al 2021 set the alert for even overwhelming effects of invasive cyanobacteria the low observed costs caused by plankton invasions are clearly attributable to taxonomic gaps but also likely reflects the difficulties in translating their indirect impacts into monetary expenditures particularly considering the subjective metrics e g the aesthetics value of waterbodies e g jochmsen et al 1998 naselli flores and padisák 2022 or the utilization of inappropriate temporal data e g arcifa et al 2020 water quality is a key ecosystem service commonly affected by nutrient enrichment and pollution albeit commonly associated with phytoplankton blooms and not to the effect of invasive species e g amorim and moura 2020 gonzález madina et al 2021 naselli flores and padisák 2022 another example is the cascading effect through lakes food web through this invasion mechanism the predator bythotrephes longimanus led to losses of us 86 5 163 million for restoring water clarity walsh et al 2016 however the world worst invasive cercopagis pengoi also a predatory cladoceran responsible for us 5 million of economic costs related to impacts on fisheries pimentel 2005 has yet no costs assessments of impacts on environment and ecosystem services moreover many other damaging invasive species are also missing from invacost the parasitic copepod lernaea cyprinacea which infests commercially important fishes soares et al 2018 artemia franciscana capable of spreading cysts of protozoan parasites e g giardia that infect a wide range of vertebrates including humans mendez hermida et al 2006 and the dinoflagellate ceratium furcoides whose frequent blooming negatively affect economically important fish pacheco et al 2021 therefore here we suggest some emerging holoplanktonic species of concern for future assessment of costs fig 5 we suggested these species based on their potential to exert dual effects rising economic and public health concerns in a large geographic extension literature based information table s1 e g act as disease vectors and lead to environmental problems despite the higher costs of pathogens free living life forms are relevant for our understanding of the trophic relationships in pelagic environments and are most likely to interact with and impact other species e g responsible for biomass decline and trophic disruptions bowen et al 2018 javidpour et al 2020 also early and juvenile stages are more readily dispersed propagules flannery et al 2016 javidpour et al 2020 easily transported by several pathways e g as epifauna within body cavities via water currents or ballast water discharges viard et al 2006 furthermore climate change is expected to influence the geographic range abundance ontogeny and ultimately the intensity of meroplanktonic invasions by influencing the success of early stages walther et al 2009 ernandes silva et al 2016 denley and metaxas 2017 beaury et al 2020 lastly the diversity of taxa and environmental tolerances of the planktonic invaders e g freshwater hypersaline and marine can also be taken into consideration to investigate most invasive traits and the invasibility of habitats targeting more efficient monitoring efforts 5 conclusions our study highlights an uneven distribution of data in reporting costs of holoplanktonic invasions mainly due to the low number of investigated species taxonomic gap while it is difficult to predict and reliably interpret costs of aquatic invaders a continuous and rising introduction of several groups of planktonic taxa is expected and possibly enhanced by synergistic effects of other environmental human driven alterations as cost types were generally higher for damage loss than for control or management we advocate for higher efforts in early detection to avoid or minimize the spread and establishment of invasive populations for this we can rely on alternative technologies such as molecular tools e g environmental dna and metagenomics although not yet sufficiently affordable for most developing countries this can be primarily helpful in the detection of cryptic species immature stages of zooplankton and larvae of benthic taxa by doing so we could substantially reduce the costs of plankton invasive species in the future an issue that reaches beyond a shift in trophic alterations and goes on to affect water

potentially toxic cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates are completely absent from the database furthermore the data base showed a decrease in costs over time which is probably an artifact as a sharp rise of novel planktonic alien species has gained international attention also assessments of the costs of larval meroplanktonic stages of littoral and benthic invasive invertebrates are lacking whereas cumulative global cost of their adults stages is high up to us 98 billion billion and increasing considering the challenges and perspectives of increasing but unnoticed or neglected impacts by plankton invasions the assessment of their ecological and economic impacts should be of high priority graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords alien plankton ecosystem services invacost monetary loss non native pelagic invaders data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction invasion scientists managers and stakeholders have reported high and rising impacts of invasive species on ecosystems and economies worldwide bellard et al 2016 diagne et al 2021a cuthbert et al 2021 in an economically connected world a more comprehensive assessment of the geographic description and quantification of invasion impacts has been emphasized for the efficient and sustainable management of invasive taxa and invaded habitats ricciardi et al 2020 haubrock et al 2022b the economic burden exhibit more rapid increase in regions historically underappreciated by the invasion science e g africa haubrock et al 2022b and concerns about protected areas rico sánchez et al 2021 yet the invasive taxa and the magnitude and distribution of their costs are unevenly reported across types of environments and ecosystems with the aquatic invasive species being the most underrepresented when compared to the terrestrial invaders cuthbert et al 2021 hence costs of aquatic invasions may be disproportionately low due to a mismatch between high number of non native species and much lower impact assessments crystal ornelas and lockwood 2020 cuthbert et al 2021 2022 aquatic invaders are continuously proliferating as result of the global transport of goods notable by ballast water e g casas monroy et al 2015 bailey et al 2015 ricciardi and macisaac 2022 and the electronic commerce olden et al 2021 accelerated over the course of the covid 19 pandemic bhatti et al 2020 more recently global attention has also shifted towards climate driven range extensions and to anthropogenic environmental changes making recipients habitats more susceptible to invasions bellard et al 2016 seebens et al 2020 macêdo et al 2021 2022 likely the abundant planktonic invaders including meroplankton early planktonic stages of organism with a non planktonic adult life form show high propagule pressure colonizing new interconnected aquatic environments e g czerniawski and krepski 2021 therefore there has been an appeal to expand our understanding of the impacts of biological invasions at different biological organization levels crystal ornelas and lockwood 2020 and through an interdisciplinary context ricciardi et al 2020 diagne et al 2020a b this lack of knowledge is a major concern when it comes to the pelagic habitats considering planktonic organisms which themselves have many features that remain primarily overlooked worldwide e g abundance diversity and distribution jeppesen et al 2011 chust et al 2017 garcía chicote et al 2018 planktonic organisms have a pivotal ecological role in both marine and inland waters where they dictate biogeochemical cycles and mediate energy flow kerfoot et al 1988 armengol et al 2019 naselli flores and padisák 2022 in addition to the strong and complex trophic links that characterize planktonic relationships high diversity of taxa living forms and stages the interplays between holo vs meroplankton in the vertical transport of nutrients novel ecological outcomes can emerge from the examination of non native planktonic species within native communities and from the context dependency of their impacts to date invasive plankton impact evaluations are scarce or are biased towards few taxa that caused impacts in developed counties dexter and bollens 2019 or toward laboratory experiments with limiting extrapolation power e g oliveira et al 2019 but see dexter and bollens 2020a 2020b despite the paucity of evidence some impacts have been related to plankton invasions human health through toxin release or parasite hosting ito and olesen 2017 water quality deterioration from indirect changes in habitat conditions e g turbidity walsh et al 2016 massive fish kills through oxygen depletion and histological damage and bottom up disruptions of trophic relationships amorim and moura 2020 pacheco et al 2021 gonzález madina et al 2021 at present we assume that knowledge gaps on the economic costs of plankton invasions may be a result of the considerable underestimation of their destructive potential especially if we consider indirect effects and assessment limitations using the invacost database diagne et al 2020b we address the following questions to understand the current economic dimension of this problem 1 what are the documented economic costs of invasive planktonic species globally 2 how do these costs change over time and how are they distributed among main economic activities 3 what are the costliest invasive species among them all also we discuss the expected gaps of knowledge on meroplanktonic stages and its implications for costly negative effects in the planktonic habitat and of their adult stages 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we compared the economic costs of handling invasive holoplanktonic species and organisms with those of meroplanktonic stages using the invacost database the invacost is a comprehensive compilation and description of economic cost estimates of biological invasions worldwide diagne et al 2020a b the database was developed following a systematic and standardized methodology to extract information from scientific articles grey literature stakeholders and expert advertisement all methods and procedures for data search retention extraction validation collation and improvements are available in diagne et al 2020a b we used the most up to date version of invacost version 4 0 doi 10 6084 m9 figshare 12668570 which contains 13 123 cost entries referring to a unique cost value both in local currencies and 2017 us rates there is also a set of specific descriptors of the cost s spatial and temporal information the taxonomy of the invasive species the cost typology the impacted sectors and the document reporting the cost diagne et al 2020a we used a subset of this database focusing on aquatic environments where the costs were estimated and where the invasive species lives independently of where the cost occurred we classified holoplanktonic organisms which fell into the following groups virioplankton dna and rna viruses with few nanometers in diameter bacterioplankton gram negative bacteria belonging to aeromonadaceae family mycoplankton fungi like pathogens especially oomycetes with microscopic filamentous dimension phytoplankton unicellular algae from families raphidophyceae prymnesiaceae and cymbellaceae with dimension 10 45 μm zooplankton platyhelminthes 0 5 1 0 mm branchiopoda cladocera and anostraca with dimensions 10 15mm scyphozoa and ctenophora with dimension 14 18 cm and meroplankton which included animals with early stages in the pelagic zone such as mollusks crustaceans and some insects for a detailed species list see table s1 and the glossary for definitions we extracted all economic costs associated with aquatic organisms filtering the information on the descriptive field environment we checked the data subset to remove any missing data on the economic costs our final databases had 43 entries of holoplanktonic species table s2 and 714 entries of meroplankton table s3 due to the small number of resulting cost information for holoplanktonic species we also included data classified as having low reliability n 8 e g not fully accessible information and as potential implementation n 13 observed or expected through modeling or extrapolations following adelino et al 2021 for meroplanktonic data we instead retained only the costs classified as observed and also those of high reliability column method reliability see diagne et al 2020a for further details for model analyses we used the final subset for meroplanktonic organisms 597 entries we classified the groups according to the typology of the costs they have promoted namely damage loss for economic losses due to the impact of invaders e g infrastructure alteration medical care or damage repair management for economic resources allocated to actions towards avoiding the invasion or dealing with established invaders e g prevention control or eradication mixed when the cost includes both damage and management elements see also vaissière et al 2022 we also categorized data on which societal or market sectors were impacted by each group using data from the impacted sector descriptive field agriculture food and other products produced by human activities through using natural and plant resources from their ecosystems authorities stakeholders governmental services and or official organizations dedicated to management of biological invasions environment impacts on natural resources and or ecosystem services fishery impacts on fisheries and aquaculture health cost related to the sanitary demands of people public and social welfare activities or services related to the human well being at a broader sense such as personal goods or quality of life and mixed when more than a single sector was involved 2 2 data analysis we performed all analyses in r version 4 1 2 r core team 2021 using the invacost r package leroy et al 2020 for analyses and ggplot2 version 3 3 5 wickham 2011 for data visualization we first compared the economic costs reported for each group holo and meroplankton using the above classification scheme then we examined annual variations in economic costs considering that some of the entries in the database described total costs over multiple years we used the function expandyearlycosts to determine the annual costs this function divides the total cost by the number of years and converts it to a cost per year removing entries with an unspecified period in the database we first derived the annual trend of costs caused by planktonic invasive species through the function summarizecosts this function provides a summary of the cumulative costs and the average annual costs of invasive alien species and divides it into regular periods 1970 2020 based on cost estimates as they appeared in the invacost database to estimate and predict the trend of the economic costs of invasive planktonic species over time we fitted models of annual costs using the function modelcosts on the log10 transformed cost estimates per year this function performs different modeling techniques ordinary least squares regressions linear and quadratic robust regressions linear and quadratic generalized additive models gam and other analyses not applied to our data but see diagne et al 2020a we calibrated all models to follow a robust linear regression using cost data as a response variable and time as the predictor considering that our subsets for holo n 43 and meroplankton n 597 are too small to make reliable predictions we used the model approach to detect tendencies for each group in doing so we could subsidize our discussion based on the effects of insufficient data on the perceived threat posed by a group of species 3 results the costs of holoplanktonic species were assessed in 17 countries comprising in north america the united states and mexico central america chile eastern europe bulgaria georgia romania russia turkey and ukraine israel central europe spain and scotland northern europe denmark sweden finland and norway and new zealand our sample included three viruses two fungal like organisms one bacterium four phytoplankton and six zooplankton taxa fig 1 geographical and taxonomic disparities associated with costs were perceived for example a single species caused damages that cost up to us 8 million in new zealand one entry while 8 species in northern europe cost altogether us 149 million fig 1 holoplanktonic taxa listed in the invacost database were from 13 systematic orders excluding viruses estimated costs and brief descriptive notes of their impacts are also provided in table 1 all reported costs were from non urban areas and only one was from a protected island canary islands attributable to artemia franciscana kellogg 1906 anostraca crustacea altogether holoplanktonic invasive species were responsible for costs around us 5 883 billion the majority of the reported cost estimates was associated with damage loss us 5 877 billion rather than management costs us 0 005 billion fig 2 this pattern was consistent across groups except for bacterioplankton which had slightly larger costs directed to manage invasions and or to mitigate their impacts 54 1 virioplankton was the costliest us 5 4 billion group and together with mycoplankton 99 9 had the largest share in damage loss costs the greatest impact of holoplanktonic invasions was on fishery us 5 5 billion with virioplankton being responsible for the majority of the costs followed by phytoplanktonic species fig 2 many impacts were shared among sectors us 317 9 million but all of them included fishery interventions by the public and private sectors authorities stakeholders category were responsible for 54 1 of the costs related to bacterioplankton environmental costs were underrepresented and accounted for less than 1 as associated with zooplankton the estimated global cost of crustaceans 10 taxa insects 2 taxa and molluscans 13 taxa reached us 98 billion mainly attributed to damage loss us 82 billion however none of the cost assessments resulted from impacts caused by their early meroplanktonic stages most costs associated with insecta 89 7 and crustacea 81 9 were also directed to damage loss in contrast the costs related to mollusca were nearly equally attributed to damage loss 55 and mixed 41 8 with the latter being related to control measures mollusks have caused an economic loss of us 16 5 billion mainly spent by authorities and stakeholders us 6 2 billion 37 9 and on public and social welfare us 4 8 billion 28 9 the lowest costs were attributed to crustaceans us 384 million mostly related to the fishery sector 36 3 health expenditures were exclusively related to the insect group us 6 3 billion and represented 7 8 of the total cost caused by this group worldwide us 81 billion the costs of biological invasions of holoplanktonic organisms exponentially increased until the 90s reaching a peak in 1995 and then steadily decreased towards 2020 during this period invasions cost on average us 142 9 million per year figure 3 costs generated by adult taxa with meroplanktonic stages have however exponentially increased with a mean annual cost of us 2 billion the 2000 2010 decade was the costliest reaching us 8 billion of annual costs followed by the 2010 2020 year period where nearly us 6 5 billion were spent per year to deal solely with adults stages although models indicated a quadratic tendency for holoplankton with a decrease in costs from the 2000s forward figure 4 a all modeling techniques confirmed that costs have continuously increased each year since 1970 for adult organisms with meroplanktonic stages figure 4b 4 discussion our global assessment on the economic impacts of plankton invasions identified costs of up to us 5 billion holoplankton between 1960 and 2021 the current economic costs of holoplankton were compiled solely from 16 invasive species here split within virio 3 taxa bacterio 1 myco 2 taxa phyto 4 taxa and zooplankton 6 taxa reported costs with holoplankton were driven mainly by damage loss rather than expenses incurred for management these results are in line with the overall pattern found for the pool of invasive species in invacost database indicating insufficient management and the urgent need to increase spending towards more cost efficient actions particularly pre invasion management cuthbert et al 2022 both fishery and mixed sectors were the most compromised economic sectors respectively caused by microbial pathogens or not clearly distinguished overall costs are likely expected to be underreported as the aforementioned taxa can also account for indirect impacts affecting some overlooked economic sectors e g health environment and public social welfare we illustrated higher costs of invertebrates with meroplanktonic stages us 98 billion crustaceans insects and mollusks however costs of their larval stages are absent in invacost database and studies concerning invasions of meroplanktonic organisms are scarce bollens et al 2002 despite the increasing trend of costs with their adult stages in recent decades we also advocate that meroplanktonic organisms become a target and priority for invasion early warning ernandes silva et al 2016 partly contributing to avoid or minimize the massive negative impact of their adult stages on biodiversity water quality and economies mollusks haubrock et al 2022a insects bradshaw et al 2016 fish haubrock et al 2022b 4 1 geographical distribution of costs we identified an unevenly spatial distribution of costs worldwide with a significant discrepancy between developing and developed countries disproportionately more data on invader impacts are available in the global north bellard and jeschke 2015 bellard et al 2016 dexter and bollens 2019 despite these biased geographical cost estimates plankton costs represent a higher fraction when compared to the total costs for all groups of aquatic and terrestrial alien species of some regional assessments e g italy haubrock et al 2021a méxico rico sánchez et al 2021 and singapore haubrock et al 2021b investments in management of invasive species such as those arising from infectious diseases caused by pathogens mainly viruses and bacteria were also geographically skewed towards north america europe and oceania haubrock et al 2022c although central america and chile showed the highest reported costs exclusively handling viruses in chile and new zealand we found enormous costs associated with a single species of a diatom didymosphenia geminata while northern europe was the only geographical area that had costs with at least one taxon from each of the holoplanktonic groups the lack of reported costs for africa and asia as well as the few entries from north america and oceania are notable however several recent studies have shown raising costs of biological invasions in australia bradshaw et al 2021 china and india liu et al 2021 or southern and eastern africa diagne et al 2021b while these increases may be driven by specific taxonomic groups non planktonic haubrock et al 2022c suggest that regions which previously had lower research effort e g africa exhibit higher asymptotic increase comparable to regions historically at the forefront of invasion research e g united states costs of planktonic invasive species were also scarce or absent in most south american country e g in brazil that harbours a significant portion of natural resources with extensive wetlands groundwater and irrigation systems contradictorily information on the expansion of invasive plankton species in brazil is rising matsumura tundisi and silva 2002 anderson et al 2012 macêdo et al 2020 severiano et al 2022 but the quantification of their associated impacts were never documented 4 2 temporal gaps while cost estimates of holoplankton have been decreasing over time there is an increasing trend with costs of many other groups included in invacost diagne et al 2020a haubrock et al 2022b historically monetary costs of holoplankton introductions started with platyhelminthes gyrodactylus salaris in 1977 while the most recent register was in 2017 for mycoplankton batrachochytrium dendrobatidis there were only two bacterioplankton entries in 2006 and 2009 while phyto and zooplankton costs were observed mainly in the last two decades despite the fact that the harmful effects of algal blooms were recognized as already as the 1970s maso and garces 2006 zingone and enevoldsen 2000 and some reports of impacts by zooplankton were from the early 1980s moller 1984 shiganova et al 2001 there is a delay in bringing taxa invasion to the attention of the broad scientific community and managers this may be in part due to misidentifications e g mesocyclops ogunnus matsumura tundisi and silva 2002 or due to delays in labelling as invasive species extensively reported in a given area e g the case of kellicottia bostoniensis in mexico nandini et al 2022 we assume that the decrease in global economic costs of planktonic species shown in the model estimates to be an artifact because of lack of data and research effort also combining holo and meroplanktonic invasions than holoplankton alone may show a more realistic trend of costs and potential impacts for the pelagic habitats worldwide the slightly decrease in costs during 2010 2020 is a lag time in reporting of costs due to the publishing process 4 3 taxonomic gaps there were only 16 species among holoplanktonic invasive causing costs stressing our plea on the underestimation of their costs worldwide due to a clear taxonomic gap dexter and bollens 2019 in their review on zooplankton invasions pointed out 139 non native holoplanktonic species and approximately half of the surveyed publications concerned solely four species bythotrephes longimanus leydig 1860 mnemioposis leidyi cercopagis pengoi ostroumov 1891 and daphnia lumholtzi absent in the invacost database in addition only 4 3 of the 139 studies informed on their economic impacts also multiple zooplanktonic species have shown much higher non native distributions than previously reported e g pseudodiaptomus forbesi oithona davisae bosmina coregoni kellicottia bostoniensis dexter et al 2020b macêdo et al 2020 similarly phytoplankton was poorly represented in the invacost database with only four taxa listed see table 1 however the european alien species database easin 2022 alone lists around 117 phytoplankton taxa as alien in marine and freshwater environments among them some toxin producing and bloom forming algae these numbers may indicate that less costly species are not less harmful or potentially impactful but probably less studied e g invasive cyanobacteria and microscopic stages of non planktonic invertebrates according to wolf and klaiber 2017 most of the state and local governments of the united states considered harmful algal blooms to be somewhat serious or very serious issues economic losses related to eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms have been addressed in several cases e g dodds et al 2009 wolf and klaiber 2017 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 though in many largely unmeasured or not properly quantified carmichael and boyer 2016 however costs of invasive cyanobacteria are lacking in the invacost database the potential negative impacts and underlying neglected costs of invasive cyanobacteria might be overwhelming and include changes in the abiotic environment and biogeochemical cycles shifts in microbial communities not to mention the effect of single or multiple toxins on biodiversity by acute and sub lethal effects on consumers and potential competitors sukenik et al 2012 sukenik et al 2015 additionally the co occurrence of multiple invasive species kokocinski and soininen 2019 and harmful impacts in freshwaters of remote oceanic islands costa et al 2021 set the alert for even overwhelming effects of invasive cyanobacteria the low observed costs caused by plankton invasions are clearly attributable to taxonomic gaps but also likely reflects the difficulties in translating their indirect impacts into monetary expenditures particularly considering the subjective metrics e g the aesthetics value of waterbodies e g jochmsen et al 1998 naselli flores and padisák 2022 or the utilization of inappropriate temporal data e g arcifa et al 2020 water quality is a key ecosystem service commonly affected by nutrient enrichment and pollution albeit commonly associated with phytoplankton blooms and not to the effect of invasive species e g amorim and moura 2020 gonzález madina et al 2021 naselli flores and padisák 2022 another example is the cascading effect through lakes food web through this invasion mechanism the predator bythotrephes longimanus led to losses of us 86 5 163 million for restoring water clarity walsh et al 2016 however the world worst invasive cercopagis pengoi also a predatory cladoceran responsible for us 5 million of economic costs related to impacts on fisheries pimentel 2005 has yet no costs assessments of impacts on environment and ecosystem services moreover many other damaging invasive species are also missing from invacost the parasitic copepod lernaea cyprinacea which infests commercially important fishes soares et al 2018 artemia franciscana capable of spreading cysts of protozoan parasites e g giardia that infect a wide range of vertebrates including humans mendez hermida et al 2006 and the dinoflagellate ceratium furcoides whose frequent blooming negatively affect economically important fish pacheco et al 2021 therefore here we suggest some emerging holoplanktonic species of concern for future assessment of costs fig 5 we suggested these species based on their potential to exert dual effects rising economic and public health concerns in a large geographic extension literature based information table s1 e g act as disease vectors and lead to environmental problems despite the higher costs of pathogens free living life forms are relevant for our understanding of the trophic relationships in pelagic environments and are most likely to interact with and impact other species e g responsible for biomass decline and trophic disruptions bowen et al 2018 javidpour et al 2020 also early and juvenile stages are more readily dispersed propagules flannery et al 2016 javidpour et al 2020 easily transported by several pathways e g as epifauna within body cavities via water currents or ballast water discharges viard et al 2006 furthermore climate change is expected to influence the geographic range abundance ontogeny and ultimately the intensity of meroplanktonic invasions by influencing the success of early stages walther et al 2009 ernandes silva et al 2016 denley and metaxas 2017 beaury et al 2020 lastly the diversity of taxa and environmental tolerances of the planktonic invaders e g freshwater hypersaline and marine can also be taken into consideration to investigate most invasive traits and the invasibility of habitats targeting more efficient monitoring efforts 5 conclusions our study highlights an uneven distribution of data in reporting costs of holoplanktonic invasions mainly due to the low number of investigated species taxonomic gap while it is difficult to predict and reliably interpret costs of aquatic invaders a continuous and rising introduction of several groups of planktonic taxa is expected and possibly enhanced by synergistic effects of other environmental human driven alterations as cost types were generally higher for damage loss than for control or management we advocate for higher efforts in early detection to avoid or minimize the spread and establishment of invasive populations for this we can rely on alternative technologies such as molecular tools e g environmental dna and metagenomics although not yet sufficiently affordable for most developing countries this can be primarily helpful in the detection of cryptic species immature stages of zooplankton and larvae of benthic taxa by doing so we could substantially reduce the costs of plankton invasive species in the future an issue that reaches beyond a shift in trophic alterations and goes on to affect water quality worldwide declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

15682,centralized sludge treatment plants cstps are implicated as strong hotspots of antibiotic resistance genes args however the knowledge gap on the fate of intracellular and extracellular args iargs and eargs and the functionality of resistant hosts limit risk assessment and management of cstp resistome here the flow of iargs and eargs across treatment units and analyses of arg hosts were systematically explored in three full scale cstps using quantitative metagenomic approaches we found that 29 of sludge args could be removed with iargs being dominant in the produced biosolids the treatment process significantly affected the variations of iarg and earg abundance while no significant difference in composition between iargs and eargs was observed in cstps 15 of 295 recovered genomes were identified as antibiotic resistant hosts among which actinobacteriota tended to encode multiple resistance the key functions of arg hosts were relative to the biological organic removal e g carbohydrates there also existed relationships between certain resistance mechanisms and functional traits indicating that args might take part in the physiological process of microorganisms in the sludge treatment these findings provide important insight into the differential resistome variations and host functionality which would be crucial in the management of antibiotic resistance in cstps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords centralized sludge treatment plants resistome sludge treatment step resistant host data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dissemination of antibacterial resistance has one of the greatest global threats to public health berendonk et al 2015 most of the antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args emitted from anthropogenic sources in urban areas eventually enter wastewater treatment plants wwtps guo et al 2017 as an important barrier wwtps effectively remove the args in the effluent ju et al 2019 but the args are mainly concentrated in the sewage sludge xue et al 2019 which are implicated as stronger point sources for their release into the environment the conventional stabilization treatment of surplus sludge on the site of wwtps plays a significant role in reducing the abundance of args and the relevant environmental risks of biosolids disposal ju et al 2016 sun et al 2019 tong et al 2019 differing from this scenario the surplus sludge is always thickened for reducing the volume followed by anaerobic digestion ad in the centralized sludge treatment plants cstps in china and parts of europe thomsen et al 2017 different strategies for antibiotic resistance management would be considered in this case because the feeding sludge properties and the treatment steps are different from the in situ process of sludge therefore the systematical understanding and evaluation of the fate and dissemination of args in cstps are of great significance the thickened sludge normally 80 water content undergoes several consecutive treatment steps in cstps including pulping thermal hydrolysis it depends anaerobic digestion and dewatering each treatment process may affect the fate of sludge args while most of the studies usually focused on the mitigation performance of args in a specific processing unit i e anaerobic digestion some lab scale studies have reported the rebounding effects of sludge args in anaerobic digestion after pretreatments ma et al 2011 wang et al 2019 it was also found that the arg amount varies greatly across different treatment steps in full scale wwtps ju et al 2019 pallares vega et al 2021 however the flow of sludge args through cstps remains unknown limiting the development of strategies for controlling args in the produced biosolids our recent work has advanced the understanding of the args fate from the perspective of intracellular and extracellular fractions of dna idna and edna based on lab scale experiments it revealed a conversion of intracellular args iargs to extracellular args earg during thermal hydrolysis treatment of sludge which strongly affected the fate of args in the subsequent fermentation step cai et al 2022 from this point of view the flow of iargs and eargs traversing the treatment units in cstps would be distinct impelling us to explore the real pattern of sludge args and how they are influenced for a better understanding of sludge resistome and dissemination risks arg composition has been evaluated in terms of both idna and edna fractions using the metagenomic sequencing method one recent work investigated the profile of iargs and eargs in activated sludge of wwtps finding that there was no significant difference in the diversity between eargs and iargs zhou et al 2019 another study also revealed similar compositions of eargs and iargs among three different environments i e livestock manure sewage sludge and lake sediment zou et al 2022 however a significant difference in compositions between iargs and eargs was observed in the farm wastewater treatment process liang et al 2022 sui et al 2019 this controversy might be explained by the temporal and spatial succession of resistome prompting the hypothesis that the consecutive treatment steps of cstps could integratively affect the sludge resistome in the idna and edna fractions considering the high solid content of sludge the high microbial density and concentrated excellular conditions would accelerate the exchange of the genetic elements aminov 2011 driving both intracellular and extracellular resistomes moreover the identity of resistant hosts in sludge treatment has been fully investigated for the risk assessment of antibiotic resistance the extensive existence of resistant hosts has been observed in the biological treatment of sludge ju et al 2016 shi et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 however the main functional traits e g hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of arg hosts are still poorly understood the knowledge is of particular interest as the locally adapted functional microbes in cstps are still dedicated to organic and nutrient removal as for the intrinsic function whether the resistance would be correlated to the other physiological functions remains unexplored efforts are needed to fill these knowledge gaps on antibiotic resistance in cstps the aim of this study is to gain an overview of the fate from influent to effluent of both iargs and eargs and the functionality of resistant hosts in cstps the metagenomes combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr were used to characterize the sludge resistome metagenomic assembly and binning methods were conducted to identify and compare the prevalence of resistance hosts and their key functional traits we hypothesized that 1 the variations of args in idna and edna fractions traversing sludge treatment units would be different 2 treatment process and dna fraction would both affect the resistome composition 3 the resistant hosts would be core functional players and there would exist relationships between the resistance and core functions in the sludge treatment system our results provide a comprehensive and in depth understanding of how the centralized sludge treatment process influences the args and what key functionality the resistant hosts play which provide useful guidance to the risk assessment and control strategy of antibacterial resistance in cstps 2 materials and methods supplementary methods are available in the supplementary information including characteristics of cstps physicochemical analyses amplification sequencing bioinformatic analysis etc 2 1 sludge sample collection three chinese cstps of different sized were considered and the information on plants was described in table s1 the sludge samples were taken from november 2020 to december 2020 across different treatment steps from the three aforementioned cstps the sampling points are displayed in fig s1 samples were collected once as grab samples in 0 5 l sterile plastic bottles 500 g each with four replicates the feeding sludge samples further referred to as raw sludge were collected from the mixed sludge from the storage hopper the pulped sludge hydrolyzed sludge and digested sludge were taken from sludge samples leaving the pulper thermal hydrolysis reactor and digester respectively all the collected samples were immediately placed into cooling boxes in dry ice and transported to the laboratory a pooled sample was obtained by evenly mixing sludge from each type of replicate sample then two replicate subsamples were backed up and frozen at 20 c until processing for the downstream chemical analysis and dna extraction 2 2 edna and idna extraction the subsample was used for extracting edna and idna according to the reported method dong et al 2019 mao et al 2014 briefly 2 5 g wet weight of each subsample were added to 0 2 g of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone aladdin co and washed three times using 4 ml of 0 12 m sodium phosphate buffer at ph 8 0 each time the mixture was shaken at 250 r min for 10 min at 25 c followed by centrifugation at 10 000 r min for 10 min at 4 c the merged supernatants were filtered through a sterile membrane 0 22 μm and the edna in the filtrate was extracted using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide corinaldesi et al 2005 the cell pellets were lyophilized and extracted for idna using a fastdna spin kit for soil the quality and the quantity of the extracted dna were determined both using nanodrop thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa and qubit fluorometer life technologies carlsbad ca usa the dna extracts were split for 16s rrna gene amplification qpcr and the construction of metagenomic libraries 2 3 metagenomic assembly annotation and quantitative analyses a total of 36 samples were selected for shotgun metagenomic sequencing on an illumina novaseq6000 platform lc bio co hangzhou china the averaged sequencing data reached 8 gb for each sample raw metagenomic reads were evaluated with fastqc v 0 11 9 the low quality sequences were removed and adaptors were trimmed using trimmomatic v 0 32 bolger et al 2014 to ensure a minimum quality score of 20 quality controlled reads from each sample were then assembled individually into contigs using megahit v 1 1 1 li et al 2015 with the following parameters k min 61 min contig len 1000 the quality of assemblies was evaluated using quast v 5 0 2 gurevich et al 2013 open reading frames of metagenomic contigs were predicted by prodigal v 2 6 2 hyatt et al 2010 and annotated by aligning them against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database v 3 0 9 the built in cutoff for arg identification was 80 nucleic acid alignment identity and 40 coverage the mobile genetic elements mges were identified against ncbi non redundant protein database using blastp with an e value 10 5 with the same parameters 80 identity and 40 coverage annotations were categorized as mges based on string match to one of the following keywords transposase transposon conjugative integrase integron recombinase resolvase conjugal mobilization recombination forsberg et al 2014 sample information was summarized in table s3 the metagenomic sequencing data were deposited in the china national gene bank database under the project accession number cnp0002985 the absolute and relative abundance of resistance genes and mges of a certain sample were estimated according to the previous study ju et al 2019 briefly the metagenomic reads of each sample were individually mapped to its gene set using bowtie 2 with default parameters a cross sample mapping strategy was used to generate a non redundant set of resistance genes and mges of all samples the relative abundance of each gene in each sample was calculated using the metric table s5 i e the reads per kilobase 16s rrna gene rpk 16s the absolute abundance of each gene was obtained by multiplying the relative abundance by the copies of the 16s rrna gene per gram of sample determined by qpcr the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 and integronase gene intl1 were used as representative arg and mge respectively and highly comparable results of gene abundance were obtained from the quantitative metagenomic approach and the qpcr method fig s2 2 4 metagenomic binning taxonomic assignment and functional annotation the assembled contigs were clustered to recover metagenome assembled genomes mags using maxbin v2 2 4 wu et al 2014 metabat2 v2 12 1 kang et al 2019 and concoct v0 9 0 alneberg et al 2014 through metawrap v1 3 2 contig length 1000 bp uritskiy et al 2018 the mags were further refined to produce high quality individual genomes using the built in refining module of metawrap and only genomes with completeness 80 and contamination 10 were retained as high quality mags taxonomy affiliation of each mag was conducted using the software gtdb tk toolkit v0 3 0 based on the genome taxonomy database gtdb with default parameters chaumeil et al 2019 among the recovered genomes 116 mags consisting of 106 bacteria and 10 archaea were exactly annotated the phylogenetic relationships of 285 bacterial and 10 archaeal mags were individually generated with fasttree v2 1 10 price et al 2010 and visualized in the interactive tree of life letunic and bork 2007 the args and mges carried by mags were identified using the same database 80 identity and 40 coverage the functional classification of mags was determined using the seed overbeek et al 2014 with default parameters and the number of subsystem feature counts for each category was obtained 2 5 statistical analysis all the comparative analyses between sludge treatment steps and dna fractions idna and edna were based on data collected from three cstps however samples collected from the thermal hydrolysis reactor were not feasible due to the low amount of dna the statistical analysis linear mixed models and multivariate analysis were conducted in r 4 1 3 r core team 2022 and rstudio https www rstudio com with the packages stats lmer bates et al 2014 lmertest kuznetsova et al 2017 and vegan oksanen et al 2017 to evaluate the contribution of either the treatment steps pulping and digestion or dna fractions idna and edna fraction to the removal of args linear mixed models were used with observations clustered by three tested plants the relative abundance arghies 16s rrna genes and absolute abundance log transformed concentrations log10 of gene copies per gram of args and mges from each sample type were used as the response variable the explanatory variables tested in the mixed model were treatment process and dna fraction fixed effects representing the location of the sample within the cstp and the idna edna fraction three full scale cstps were tested in this work while preliminary analysis found that there was significant variation in arg flow between these plants this is due to the different properties of feed sludge and operation conditions identified table s1 given that the arg variation among different cstps was known the cstps was considered as independent random effects random intercept modeled the permutational multivariate analysis was performed to test group differences in the composition of resistomes principal coordinates analysis was performed to compare similarities in resistome and microbiome structure across the sludge treatment units procrustes analysis was used to compare structural similarity between resistomes and microbiomes redundancy analysis rda was conducted to explain the resistomes by main biotic and abiotic factors 3 results 3 1 args shared by dna fractions and treatment units gene inventories of microbiomes were built from raw pulped and digested sludge metagenomes in intracellular and extracellular dna fractions of three communal cstps bioinformatics analysis of 36 metagenomes was collected and a total of 2749723 non redundant open reading frames were identified the resistance genes were assigned and categorized into 20 resistance classes based on the type of antibacterial agents to which they were predicted to confer resistance table s6 there were no unique sets of args between idna and edna fractions args in edna were a proper subset of args in idna with the shared genes of more than 99 fig s3a revealing the consistency of args in the two dna fractions the highest richness of args was observed in raw sludge samples which contain all the args in sludge samples collected from the treatment units the pulped and digested sludge harbored the unique sets of args by 1 6 and 0 5 while all the treatment units shared 97 8 of args fig s3b indicating the args stability across the treatment process 3 2 variations of intracellular and extracellular args between treatment steps to improve the data comparability between studies the relative and absolute abundance of resistomes were calculated by the combination of metagenomics with qpcr methods the interaction effects of dna fraction and treatment process significantly affected both the total absolute and relative abundance of resistomes p 0 05 table s8 every gram of raw sludge dw contained from 1 7 1010 to 3 1 1010 copies of args in idna which was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in the corresponding edna fraction ranging from 4 3 107 to 7 0 108 copies fig 1 a dna fraction and treatment steps simultaneously affected the absolute abundance of args showing various patterns across the two factors relative to the raw sludge the digested sludge had significantly p 0 05 lower gene copies of total args in idna reduction by 29 0 but presented no significant difference in args of edna in contrast the pulped sludge had significantly p 0 05 higher gene copies in edna fraction compared with raw sludge this profile was also consistent with the 16s rrna gene fig s4a and mges fig s5 revealing the release of idna or the conversion of idna to edna on the other hand the relative abundance of resistance genes in idna was not significantly p 0 05 different across treatment units fig 1 the lower relative abundance of resistomes in edna was observed in digested sludge samples fig 1b which may be due to the reduction of rpk abundance of a gene or the increase of the 16s rrna gene percentage in metagenome fig s4b these results together suggest that the args in the idna fraction dominate across the cstps and that the release of idna plays an important role in the variations of args during the sludge treatment process the mitigation of different types of args was further checked in the produced biosolids relative to the raw sludge based on the relative change in abundance of args classes fig 2 for relative abundance fig 2a all the resistance gene types in edna fraction decreased from raw sludge to digested sludge blue bars in which 16 out of 21 arg types showed a significant reduction in the relative abundance for example high reduction rates were observed in the arg classes such as multidrug 49 glycopeptide 53 and aminoglycoside 62 these results were in line with the trend of total relative abundance shown in fig 1 however only 6 out of 21 types showed a significant reduction of the iargs and there were thus no significant changes in the total relative abundance of iargs in the produced biosolids for the absolute abundance fig 2b several arg types decreased significantly p 0 05 from raw sludge to digested sludge 7 types in idna and 2 types in edna the most pronounced reduction for iargs was observed suggesting that sludge treatment had a good performance for the mitigation of intracellular resistomes it was also noted that most resistance types in edna e g tetracycline also showed the abundance reduction but lacked significant differences indicating that the absolute abundance of these resistance genes could fluctuate greatly across the tested cstps the broad coverage of the 16s rrna gene copies 2 logs fig s4a in edna among the digested sludge samples of the three plants could be responsible for the non significant reduction of eargs these results suggested a substantial relative decrease of a broad set of args after a conventional sludge treatment system 3 3 changes in resistome composition and main drivers of resistomes permutational multivariate analysis showed that the treatment process p 0 05 instead of dna fraction significantly affected the resistome composition and bacterial communities table s9 therefore all the sludge samples including both idna and edna samples were used for determining the structural variations in the resistomes and microbiomes across the treatment units fig 3 the samples were clustered into three main groups by treatment units but the overlap between raw and pulped sludge samples was observed in both resistome fig 3a and bacterial composition fig 3b suggesting that the sludge pulper could not significantly affect the structural variations in resistomes and microbiomes due to the limited reaction duration of sludge pulping it was also noted that the ordinations of resistomes and microbiomes showed high group and within cluster variances of digested sludge samples than that of raw sludge samples indicating a role of sludge treatment anaerobic digestion in the divergence of the args composition and microbial community structure additionally procrustes analyses showed strong relationships p 0 001 between resistome composition and bacterial taxa at the genus level inferred from 16s rrna sequence data r 0 67 fig s6 however these results do not prove that bacterial taxa were hosts of resistance genes combined the resistome composition correlates with bacterial community structure across the treatment units revealing their close relationship but influencing factors i e horizontal gene transfer and environmental factors still cannot be ignored in shaping the resistome composition the relative strength of main factors on the compositional variances of resistomes was compared using rda table 1 the results showed that the variances of resistome were best explained by biotic variables representing genetic mobility including transposable 34 1 integrative 29 5 and conjugative elements 35 7 suggesting that changes happen primarily in the mobilized resistome the bacterial alpha diversity metric of chao1 also explained part of the variances 8 1 while no significant contribution of shannon and simpson indexes was observed indicating the importance of the richness of the bacterial community additionally smaller significant parts of resistome compositional variances were explained by total solid 10 9 and volatile solid of sludge 17 4 suggesting that the biomass i e microbial density played an important role in the resistome composition four heavy metals i e chromium 9 5 nickel 12 6 zinc 19 7 and cadmium 8 0 were also identified as significant contributors which could theoretically be derived from gene co selection 3 4 host identity and mobility of args and functional characterization metagenomic binning reconstructed 295 high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags including 285 bacterial mags and 10 archaeal mags with 80 completeness and 10 contamination from all the sludge samples phylogenetic analysis showed that bacterial mags were classified into 15 phyla and they were most taxonomically assigned to proteobacteria 56 followed by bacteroidota 49 firmicutes 43 actinobacteriota 32 chloroflexota 28 verrucomicrobiota 13 and acidobacteriota 11 fig 4 a all the archaeal mags recovered were grouped into methanogens fig s7 44 out of 295 mags 15 were identified as antibiotic resistant hosts in which 9 and 5 encode resistance to single and multiple classes of antibiotics respectively these hosts of args belonged to nine phyla with proteobacteria 17 actinobacteriota 12 and firmicutes 6 being dominant the co occurrence of resistant mags with mges i e the mobility potential was also summarized in table s10 compared with conjugative elements integrative 56 and transposable elements 62 were significantly chi square test p 0 05 and more frequently co occurred with args in the resistant hosts suggesting the important relationships between mobility and harboring resistance the functional characterization of mags derived from the seed subsystem category and its correlations to args and mges occurrence were evaluated rda showed a significant p 0 05 but low contribution 1 1 of args and 2 2 of mges to the function composition table s11 suggesting that the occurrence of args and mges could not be the main drivers for the function composition in the sludge treatment system nevertheless the resistance type categorized by drug class showed a relatively high percent variation of 26 7 for function composition across the resistant mags table s11 the core functions among the resistant mags are the pathways relative to the microbial growth i e metabolic functions such as the carbohydrates amino acids and derivatives dna metabolism and membrane transport fig 4b suggesting the fundamental functions and their redundancy in the biological system for sludge treatment it was noteworthy that four resistant mags that belong to phylum firmicutes had high feature counts of dormancy and sporulation pathways among them two were assigned to the genera clostridium and paraclostridium indicating that they could be resistant to the sludge treatment process and might persist in the biosolids when receiving to the environment additionally butanoate metabolism pathways were compared based on two examples of resistant mags fig s8 bin 127 and bin 1081 feature all the central enzymes and complexes of acidogenesis indicating their capability of organic matter degradation in sludge digestion args located on mags are categorized into five resistance mechanisms including efflux inactivation target alteration target protection and target replacement although the variation of function composition was not significantly explained by the resistance mechanism p 0 05 table s11 the feature counts of certain function categories were found to be significantly different p 0 05 between resistance mechanisms fig s9 such as amino acids and derivatives and membrane transport pathway indicating the potential correlations of microbial metabolic function to resistant functions 4 discussion mitigating the dissemination of antibacterial resistance before discharging biosolids into the environment is the responsibility of cstps for public health in this study the variations of intracellular and extracellular resistome of sludge across the treatment steps were evaluated using quantitative metagenomic approaches the identity mobility and core functions of resistant hosts in the biological treatment system of sludge were also explored as hypothesized sludge treatment steps differentially affected the variations of args in idna and edna both abundance metrics i e relative or absolute of args had shown the interaction effects between dna fraction and treatment process table s8 the raw sludge undergoes two consecutive treatment steps excluding one plant with three steps by adding a thermal hydrolysis reactor and their roles in sludge processing were different with corresponding parameters e g temperature duration etc the viscosity of high solid sludge 20 of total solid was first reduced in a pulper operated at a high temperature 80 85 c and a short retention time 30 min the pulper unit significantly increased the amount of args in the edna fraction while the reduction of iargs was not obvious this may occur because the iargs were released into the extracellular environment under the high temperature condition and the amount of released iargs was one order of magnitude higher compared to initial eargs however a small release of iargs did not significantly affect the initial amount of iargs suggesting the low conversion efficiency of idna to edna under the pulping operation a recent study found that high processing temperature was beneficial for the release of idna and the removal of iargs cai et al 2022 when the args amount was normalized by 16s rrna genes no significant changes in both iargs and eargs were found in the pulped sludge samples compared with raw sludge it was due to the simultaneous release and similar conversion performance of intracellular 16s rrna genes along with iargs after the pulping pretreatment the pulped sludge is digested in a mesophilic reactor 37 c to allow the removal of organic matter and stabilization the abundance of eargs returned to a comparable level of raw sludge after the digestion it was reported that the eargs were susceptible to degradation by dnases rather than propagation through transformation in anaerobic conditions cai et al 2022 zou et al 2020 the total amount of iargs was also significantly removed 29 0 by the ad unit but was still dominant in the produced biosolids compared with eargs the decrease in iargs could be explained by the reduced biomass after digestion the organic matter degradation 30 was comparable with the iargs reduction a considerable part of influent bacteria including resistant hosts could not survive in the digester miller et al 2016 this is not surprising given that digesters rely on a symbiotic balance among communities of hydrolytic fermentative and methanogenic microorganisms these results are in line with the reported studies in which the removal efficiency of args ranged from 20 to 90 depending on the pretreatment or the ad operating conditions ju et al 2016 wang li and zhao 2019 xue et al 2019 for the relative abundance eargs showed a significant reduction including most classes of resistance genes figs 1 and 2a the decrease in relative abundance was likely due to the differential degradation of various extracellular genetic materials i e eargs and 16s rrna genes contrastly total iargs were not enriched in the bacterial cells fig 1 although enrichment of certain class args e g fluoroquinolone was observed fig 2 the mitigation of some gene classes was also observed in idna which could explain the statistical non significance of the total relative abundance of the resistome these results revealed that the sludge treatment process differentially influenced the variations of intracellular and extracellular resistome however the iargs are still abundant in the biosolids indicating that the cstps would release integral resistant microbial entities into the receiving environment they deserve the foremost research attention because of the capacity for the enrichment and widespread ecological associations once the produced biosolids would be applied for land use our second hypothesis stating that the resistome composition would be affected by both the treatment process and dna fraction was not confirmed although the conversion from idna to edna changed the arg flow between the treatment units compositional variations of resistome were not significantly impacted by the dna fractions table s9 our data also showed that the richness of eargs was also equal to that of iargs fig s3a these results may be because of whether the intracellular dna or the extracellular free dna was susceptible to non selective mitigation or enrichment furthermore there were no interaction effects between dna fraction and treatment steps on resistome composition suggesting compositional convergence of eargs and iargs among various treatment units zhou et al 2019 revealed that there was no significant difference in the diversity between iargs and eargs in the aeration tank activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants however the discrimination of eargs and iargs profiles can be found in soil and sediment environments which might correlate with the type of surrounding physical and genetic i e chromosomes or plasmids borne environment for args mao et al 2014 in this study the compositional convergence of eargs and iargs across treatment units i e pulper and digestor could be explained by more strongly temporal succession of both resistome and microbiome in the biotechnology than natural environment system the biological treatment unit e g digestion and aeration could be considered as a constrained environment with high microbial diversity in which microbes can be active in the exchange of genetic information and release of genetic matierals in the contrast the treatment process significantly influenced the resistome composition along with the microbial community structure fig 3 ju et al 2019 found that the richness and abundance of resistance genes vary greatly in different treatment compartments and yuan et al 2021 further revealed the cross compartment distribution of potential pathogenic populations in wwtps the different treatment reactors played a specific role in shaping the functional community revealing patterns of functional community structuring including resistome across environmental gradients louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 it was found that the resistome composition correlated significantly with the bacterial community composition fig s6 suggesting the taxonomic role in determining the sludge resistome the other biotic factors including mobility elements also play an important role in shaping compositional variations of resistomes the variances of resistome compositions were well explained by all three classes of mges 29 5 35 7 table 1 this proportion is comparable to the levels in activated sludge systems 26 35 ju et al 2019 and contaminated soils 40 47 hu et al 2017 these results revealed that the mges can strongly mobilize args in the sludge treatment process via horizontal gene transfer hgt which also occurs normally in natural ecosystems zarei baygi and smith 2021 many coexisting but taxonomically distinct microorganisms can encode the same antibacterial resistance functions e g sul1 gene wei et al 2021 indicating that bacterial phylogeny is not the only driver for the resistome composition the abiotic factors e g volatile solid and zinc in the cstps appear to play an additional role in shaping sludge resistomes the nutrients removal biomass content or the concentration of heavy metals may act as driving forces for both bacterial community and resistome composition many studies have found the extensive existence of resistant hosts in the sludge digestion system shi et al 2021 syafiuddin and boopathy 2021 tian et al 2016 prompting speculation that resistant hosts would possess the core metabolic functions in the biological reactors our work supported this hypothesis 44 mags were identified as antibiotic resistant hosts encoding resistance to both single and multiple classes of antibiotics among these resistant hosts carbohydrates and amino acids and derivatives pathways were most encoded in addition the resistant hosts could feature all the genes necessary for the butanoate metabolism suggesting that they were involved in the acidogenesis of sludge digestion the phylogenetic relationships among the resistant hosts also confirmed their functional roles in hydrolysis and acidogenesis with proteobacteria and actinobacteriota being dominant phyla fig 4a these predominant phyla have been reported as organic degrading bacteria and the main potential resistant host in the mesophilic digesters zamanzadeh et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 revealing that the resistant hosts have their specific niche and perform the key functions in the biological treatment system interestingly the phylum actinobacteriota is likely to carry more args multiple resistance fig 4a which may be due to their physiological characteristics the multiple resistance mechanisms in actinobacteriota include efflux and target replacement in this study although multiple antibiotic resistance was reported in actinobacteriota e g actinoplanes sp collinsella aerofaciens in human infections fatahi bafghi 2019 the reason for encoding multiple resistance of actinobacteriota in the mesophilic digesters needs to be further investigated furthermore the correlations between antibiotic resistance and the feature counts of core functions were explored using the high quality resistant mags we observed that the variation of 26 7 for function composition was attributed to the arg class indicating that args might take part in the physiological functions of microorganisms among the arg classes the multidrug category was found to be prevalent 21 out of 44 mags and its resistance mechanism is mainly efflux 18 out of 21 mags moreover the feature counts of certain function categories e g amino acids and derivatives and membrane transport pathways were found to be p 0 05 significantly higher in efflux than other resistance mechanisms fig s9 these results indicated that the microorganism encodes genes for efflux pumps not only for moving the antibiotics out of the cell but also for other natural physiological functions it was reported that the efflux system has a physiologic role in pumping out bacterial metabolites and signal compounds amaral et al 2014 additionally the primary transporters for efflux pumps are energy dependent directly utilizing atp as the energy source to drive transport du et al 2018 therefore the efflux pump is likely associated with energy metabolism i e substrate level phosphorylation in sludge digestion that could generate appropriate energy for physiological functions in addition to the efflux mechanism the resistance mechanism of target protection was found to have a higher feature count in dormancy and sporulation pathways suggesting the potential relationships between the antibiotic determinants and sporulation properties zidaric et al 2012 one of the great concerns is to assess the health risk of args in the receiving environment although an omic based framework considering human associated enrichment gene mobility and host pathogenicity was recently developed zhang et al 2021 the relationships between the abundance of resistance genes and the spread risk remain unclear our current priority is to control the total amount of antibacterial resistance determinants in produced biosolids and the receiving environment fortunately our data underscore that the richness improvement of relative abundance of the args was not observed in the digested sludge cstps played a positive role in reducing the absolute amounts of resistant bacteria and genes which is heavily dependent on the reduction of bacterial biomass nonetheless the intracellular resistance genes resistant hosts are still abundant after the anaerobic digestion suggesting that how to remove the resistant hosts and mitigate their transmission risk is our future direction on the other hand the limitation of this study is the lack of transcriptional activities of the resistome future work would benefit from quantitative transcriptomics and provide deep insights into the extent of antibacterial resistance in the interface between the anthropogenic and natural environments which would inform policy decisions in risk assessment and resistance surveillance for preventing the dissemination of antibacterial resistance to the environment 5 conclusions this study systematically investigated the fate of intracellular and extracellular resistome across different treatment units in cstps the differential flows of iargs and eargs were observed with iargs being abundant in the produced biosolids furthermore the treatment process significantly influenced the resistome composition along with the microbial community structure however compositional convergence of iargs and eargs across treatment units indicated the strong succession of microbiome and exchange of genetic materials the mag based analysis demonstrated that the arg hosts were taxonomically diverse and had a pronounced multiple resistance pattern in actinobacteriota besides these resistant hosts showed correlations to certain functional traits indicating that they could possess not only biological organic removal functions but also arg related physiological processes this comprehensive study could enhance our understanding of sludge resistome fate and

15682,centralized sludge treatment plants cstps are implicated as strong hotspots of antibiotic resistance genes args however the knowledge gap on the fate of intracellular and extracellular args iargs and eargs and the functionality of resistant hosts limit risk assessment and management of cstp resistome here the flow of iargs and eargs across treatment units and analyses of arg hosts were systematically explored in three full scale cstps using quantitative metagenomic approaches we found that 29 of sludge args could be removed with iargs being dominant in the produced biosolids the treatment process significantly affected the variations of iarg and earg abundance while no significant difference in composition between iargs and eargs was observed in cstps 15 of 295 recovered genomes were identified as antibiotic resistant hosts among which actinobacteriota tended to encode multiple resistance the key functions of arg hosts were relative to the biological organic removal e g carbohydrates there also existed relationships between certain resistance mechanisms and functional traits indicating that args might take part in the physiological process of microorganisms in the sludge treatment these findings provide important insight into the differential resistome variations and host functionality which would be crucial in the management of antibiotic resistance in cstps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords centralized sludge treatment plants resistome sludge treatment step resistant host data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dissemination of antibacterial resistance has one of the greatest global threats to public health berendonk et al 2015 most of the antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args emitted from anthropogenic sources in urban areas eventually enter wastewater treatment plants wwtps guo et al 2017 as an important barrier wwtps effectively remove the args in the effluent ju et al 2019 but the args are mainly concentrated in the sewage sludge xue et al 2019 which are implicated as stronger point sources for their release into the environment the conventional stabilization treatment of surplus sludge on the site of wwtps plays a significant role in reducing the abundance of args and the relevant environmental risks of biosolids disposal ju et al 2016 sun et al 2019 tong et al 2019 differing from this scenario the surplus sludge is always thickened for reducing the volume followed by anaerobic digestion ad in the centralized sludge treatment plants cstps in china and parts of europe thomsen et al 2017 different strategies for antibiotic resistance management would be considered in this case because the feeding sludge properties and the treatment steps are different from the in situ process of sludge therefore the systematical understanding and evaluation of the fate and dissemination of args in cstps are of great significance the thickened sludge normally 80 water content undergoes several consecutive treatment steps in cstps including pulping thermal hydrolysis it depends anaerobic digestion and dewatering each treatment process may affect the fate of sludge args while most of the studies usually focused on the mitigation performance of args in a specific processing unit i e anaerobic digestion some lab scale studies have reported the rebounding effects of sludge args in anaerobic digestion after pretreatments ma et al 2011 wang et al 2019 it was also found that the arg amount varies greatly across different treatment steps in full scale wwtps ju et al 2019 pallares vega et al 2021 however the flow of sludge args through cstps remains unknown limiting the development of strategies for controlling args in the produced biosolids our recent work has advanced the understanding of the args fate from the perspective of intracellular and extracellular fractions of dna idna and edna based on lab scale experiments it revealed a conversion of intracellular args iargs to extracellular args earg during thermal hydrolysis treatment of sludge which strongly affected the fate of args in the subsequent fermentation step cai et al 2022 from this point of view the flow of iargs and eargs traversing the treatment units in cstps would be distinct impelling us to explore the real pattern of sludge args and how they are influenced for a better understanding of sludge resistome and dissemination risks arg composition has been evaluated in terms of both idna and edna fractions using the metagenomic sequencing method one recent work investigated the profile of iargs and eargs in activated sludge of wwtps finding that there was no significant difference in the diversity between eargs and iargs zhou et al 2019 another study also revealed similar compositions of eargs and iargs among three different environments i e livestock manure sewage sludge and lake sediment zou et al 2022 however a significant difference in compositions between iargs and eargs was observed in the farm wastewater treatment process liang et al 2022 sui et al 2019 this controversy might be explained by the temporal and spatial succession of resistome prompting the hypothesis that the consecutive treatment steps of cstps could integratively affect the sludge resistome in the idna and edna fractions considering the high solid content of sludge the high microbial density and concentrated excellular conditions would accelerate the exchange of the genetic elements aminov 2011 driving both intracellular and extracellular resistomes moreover the identity of resistant hosts in sludge treatment has been fully investigated for the risk assessment of antibiotic resistance the extensive existence of resistant hosts has been observed in the biological treatment of sludge ju et al 2016 shi et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 however the main functional traits e g hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of arg hosts are still poorly understood the knowledge is of particular interest as the locally adapted functional microbes in cstps are still dedicated to organic and nutrient removal as for the intrinsic function whether the resistance would be correlated to the other physiological functions remains unexplored efforts are needed to fill these knowledge gaps on antibiotic resistance in cstps the aim of this study is to gain an overview of the fate from influent to effluent of both iargs and eargs and the functionality of resistant hosts in cstps the metagenomes combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr were used to characterize the sludge resistome metagenomic assembly and binning methods were conducted to identify and compare the prevalence of resistance hosts and their key functional traits we hypothesized that 1 the variations of args in idna and edna fractions traversing sludge treatment units would be different 2 treatment process and dna fraction would both affect the resistome composition 3 the resistant hosts would be core functional players and there would exist relationships between the resistance and core functions in the sludge treatment system our results provide a comprehensive and in depth understanding of how the centralized sludge treatment process influences the args and what key functionality the resistant hosts play which provide useful guidance to the risk assessment and control strategy of antibacterial resistance in cstps 2 materials and methods supplementary methods are available in the supplementary information including characteristics of cstps physicochemical analyses amplification sequencing bioinformatic analysis etc 2 1 sludge sample collection three chinese cstps of different sized were considered and the information on plants was described in table s1 the sludge samples were taken from november 2020 to december 2020 across different treatment steps from the three aforementioned cstps the sampling points are displayed in fig s1 samples were collected once as grab samples in 0 5 l sterile plastic bottles 500 g each with four replicates the feeding sludge samples further referred to as raw sludge were collected from the mixed sludge from the storage hopper the pulped sludge hydrolyzed sludge and digested sludge were taken from sludge samples leaving the pulper thermal hydrolysis reactor and digester respectively all the collected samples were immediately placed into cooling boxes in dry ice and transported to the laboratory a pooled sample was obtained by evenly mixing sludge from each type of replicate sample then two replicate subsamples were backed up and frozen at 20 c until processing for the downstream chemical analysis and dna extraction 2 2 edna and idna extraction the subsample was used for extracting edna and idna according to the reported method dong et al 2019 mao et al 2014 briefly 2 5 g wet weight of each subsample were added to 0 2 g of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone aladdin co and washed three times using 4 ml of 0 12 m sodium phosphate buffer at ph 8 0 each time the mixture was shaken at 250 r min for 10 min at 25 c followed by centrifugation at 10 000 r min for 10 min at 4 c the merged supernatants were filtered through a sterile membrane 0 22 μm and the edna in the filtrate was extracted using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide corinaldesi et al 2005 the cell pellets were lyophilized and extracted for idna using a fastdna spin kit for soil the quality and the quantity of the extracted dna were determined both using nanodrop thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa and qubit fluorometer life technologies carlsbad ca usa the dna extracts were split for 16s rrna gene amplification qpcr and the construction of metagenomic libraries 2 3 metagenomic assembly annotation and quantitative analyses a total of 36 samples were selected for shotgun metagenomic sequencing on an illumina novaseq6000 platform lc bio co hangzhou china the averaged sequencing data reached 8 gb for each sample raw metagenomic reads were evaluated with fastqc v 0 11 9 the low quality sequences were removed and adaptors were trimmed using trimmomatic v 0 32 bolger et al 2014 to ensure a minimum quality score of 20 quality controlled reads from each sample were then assembled individually into contigs using megahit v 1 1 1 li et al 2015 with the following parameters k min 61 min contig len 1000 the quality of assemblies was evaluated using quast v 5 0 2 gurevich et al 2013 open reading frames of metagenomic contigs were predicted by prodigal v 2 6 2 hyatt et al 2010 and annotated by aligning them against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database v 3 0 9 the built in cutoff for arg identification was 80 nucleic acid alignment identity and 40 coverage the mobile genetic elements mges were identified against ncbi non redundant protein database using blastp with an e value 10 5 with the same parameters 80 identity and 40 coverage annotations were categorized as mges based on string match to one of the following keywords transposase transposon conjugative integrase integron recombinase resolvase conjugal mobilization recombination forsberg et al 2014 sample information was summarized in table s3 the metagenomic sequencing data were deposited in the china national gene bank database under the project accession number cnp0002985 the absolute and relative abundance of resistance genes and mges of a certain sample were estimated according to the previous study ju et al 2019 briefly the metagenomic reads of each sample were individually mapped to its gene set using bowtie 2 with default parameters a cross sample mapping strategy was used to generate a non redundant set of resistance genes and mges of all samples the relative abundance of each gene in each sample was calculated using the metric table s5 i e the reads per kilobase 16s rrna gene rpk 16s the absolute abundance of each gene was obtained by multiplying the relative abundance by the copies of the 16s rrna gene per gram of sample determined by qpcr the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 and integronase gene intl1 were used as representative arg and mge respectively and highly comparable results of gene abundance were obtained from the quantitative metagenomic approach and the qpcr method fig s2 2 4 metagenomic binning taxonomic assignment and functional annotation the assembled contigs were clustered to recover metagenome assembled genomes mags using maxbin v2 2 4 wu et al 2014 metabat2 v2 12 1 kang et al 2019 and concoct v0 9 0 alneberg et al 2014 through metawrap v1 3 2 contig length 1000 bp uritskiy et al 2018 the mags were further refined to produce high quality individual genomes using the built in refining module of metawrap and only genomes with completeness 80 and contamination 10 were retained as high quality mags taxonomy affiliation of each mag was conducted using the software gtdb tk toolkit v0 3 0 based on the genome taxonomy database gtdb with default parameters chaumeil et al 2019 among the recovered genomes 116 mags consisting of 106 bacteria and 10 archaea were exactly annotated the phylogenetic relationships of 285 bacterial and 10 archaeal mags were individually generated with fasttree v2 1 10 price et al 2010 and visualized in the interactive tree of life letunic and bork 2007 the args and mges carried by mags were identified using the same database 80 identity and 40 coverage the functional classification of mags was determined using the seed overbeek et al 2014 with default parameters and the number of subsystem feature counts for each category was obtained 2 5 statistical analysis all the comparative analyses between sludge treatment steps and dna fractions idna and edna were based on data collected from three cstps however samples collected from the thermal hydrolysis reactor were not feasible due to the low amount of dna the statistical analysis linear mixed models and multivariate analysis were conducted in r 4 1 3 r core team 2022 and rstudio https www rstudio com with the packages stats lmer bates et al 2014 lmertest kuznetsova et al 2017 and vegan oksanen et al 2017 to evaluate the contribution of either the treatment steps pulping and digestion or dna fractions idna and edna fraction to the removal of args linear mixed models were used with observations clustered by three tested plants the relative abundance arghies 16s rrna genes and absolute abundance log transformed concentrations log10 of gene copies per gram of args and mges from each sample type were used as the response variable the explanatory variables tested in the mixed model were treatment process and dna fraction fixed effects representing the location of the sample within the cstp and the idna edna fraction three full scale cstps were tested in this work while preliminary analysis found that there was significant variation in arg flow between these plants this is due to the different properties of feed sludge and operation conditions identified table s1 given that the arg variation among different cstps was known the cstps was considered as independent random effects random intercept modeled the permutational multivariate analysis was performed to test group differences in the composition of resistomes principal coordinates analysis was performed to compare similarities in resistome and microbiome structure across the sludge treatment units procrustes analysis was used to compare structural similarity between resistomes and microbiomes redundancy analysis rda was conducted to explain the resistomes by main biotic and abiotic factors 3 results 3 1 args shared by dna fractions and treatment units gene inventories of microbiomes were built from raw pulped and digested sludge metagenomes in intracellular and extracellular dna fractions of three communal cstps bioinformatics analysis of 36 metagenomes was collected and a total of 2749723 non redundant open reading frames were identified the resistance genes were assigned and categorized into 20 resistance classes based on the type of antibacterial agents to which they were predicted to confer resistance table s6 there were no unique sets of args between idna and edna fractions args in edna were a proper subset of args in idna with the shared genes of more than 99 fig s3a revealing the consistency of args in the two dna fractions the highest richness of args was observed in raw sludge samples which contain all the args in sludge samples collected from the treatment units the pulped and digested sludge harbored the unique sets of args by 1 6 and 0 5 while all the treatment units shared 97 8 of args fig s3b indicating the args stability across the treatment process 3 2 variations of intracellular and extracellular args between treatment steps to improve the data comparability between studies the relative and absolute abundance of resistomes were calculated by the combination of metagenomics with qpcr methods the interaction effects of dna fraction and treatment process significantly affected both the total absolute and relative abundance of resistomes p 0 05 table s8 every gram of raw sludge dw contained from 1 7 1010 to 3 1 1010 copies of args in idna which was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in the corresponding edna fraction ranging from 4 3 107 to 7 0 108 copies fig 1 a dna fraction and treatment steps simultaneously affected the absolute abundance of args showing various patterns across the two factors relative to the raw sludge the digested sludge had significantly p 0 05 lower gene copies of total args in idna reduction by 29 0 but presented no significant difference in args of edna in contrast the pulped sludge had significantly p 0 05 higher gene copies in edna fraction compared with raw sludge this profile was also consistent with the 16s rrna gene fig s4a and mges fig s5 revealing the release of idna or the conversion of idna to edna on the other hand the relative abundance of resistance genes in idna was not significantly p 0 05 different across treatment units fig 1 the lower relative abundance of resistomes in edna was observed in digested sludge samples fig 1b which may be due to the reduction of rpk abundance of a gene or the increase of the 16s rrna gene percentage in metagenome fig s4b these results together suggest that the args in the idna fraction dominate across the cstps and that the release of idna plays an important role in the variations of args during the sludge treatment process the mitigation of different types of args was further checked in the produced biosolids relative to the raw sludge based on the relative change in abundance of args classes fig 2 for relative abundance fig 2a all the resistance gene types in edna fraction decreased from raw sludge to digested sludge blue bars in which 16 out of 21 arg types showed a significant reduction in the relative abundance for example high reduction rates were observed in the arg classes such as multidrug 49 glycopeptide 53 and aminoglycoside 62 these results were in line with the trend of total relative abundance shown in fig 1 however only 6 out of 21 types showed a significant reduction of the iargs and there were thus no significant changes in the total relative abundance of iargs in the produced biosolids for the absolute abundance fig 2b several arg types decreased significantly p 0 05 from raw sludge to digested sludge 7 types in idna and 2 types in edna the most pronounced reduction for iargs was observed suggesting that sludge treatment had a good performance for the mitigation of intracellular resistomes it was also noted that most resistance types in edna e g tetracycline also showed the abundance reduction but lacked significant differences indicating that the absolute abundance of these resistance genes could fluctuate greatly across the tested cstps the broad coverage of the 16s rrna gene copies 2 logs fig s4a in edna among the digested sludge samples of the three plants could be responsible for the non significant reduction of eargs these results suggested a substantial relative decrease of a broad set of args after a conventional sludge treatment system 3 3 changes in resistome composition and main drivers of resistomes permutational multivariate analysis showed that the treatment process p 0 05 instead of dna fraction significantly affected the resistome composition and bacterial communities table s9 therefore all the sludge samples including both idna and edna samples were used for determining the structural variations in the resistomes and microbiomes across the treatment units fig 3 the samples were clustered into three main groups by treatment units but the overlap between raw and pulped sludge samples was observed in both resistome fig 3a and bacterial composition fig 3b suggesting that the sludge pulper could not significantly affect the structural variations in resistomes and microbiomes due to the limited reaction duration of sludge pulping it was also noted that the ordinations of resistomes and microbiomes showed high group and within cluster variances of digested sludge samples than that of raw sludge samples indicating a role of sludge treatment anaerobic digestion in the divergence of the args composition and microbial community structure additionally procrustes analyses showed strong relationships p 0 001 between resistome composition and bacterial taxa at the genus level inferred from 16s rrna sequence data r 0 67 fig s6 however these results do not prove that bacterial taxa were hosts of resistance genes combined the resistome composition correlates with bacterial community structure across the treatment units revealing their close relationship but influencing factors i e horizontal gene transfer and environmental factors still cannot be ignored in shaping the resistome composition the relative strength of main factors on the compositional variances of resistomes was compared using rda table 1 the results showed that the variances of resistome were best explained by biotic variables representing genetic mobility including transposable 34 1 integrative 29 5 and conjugative elements 35 7 suggesting that changes happen primarily in the mobilized resistome the bacterial alpha diversity metric of chao1 also explained part of the variances 8 1 while no significant contribution of shannon and simpson indexes was observed indicating the importance of the richness of the bacterial community additionally smaller significant parts of resistome compositional variances were explained by total solid 10 9 and volatile solid of sludge 17 4 suggesting that the biomass i e microbial density played an important role in the resistome composition four heavy metals i e chromium 9 5 nickel 12 6 zinc 19 7 and cadmium 8 0 were also identified as significant contributors which could theoretically be derived from gene co selection 3 4 host identity and mobility of args and functional characterization metagenomic binning reconstructed 295 high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags including 285 bacterial mags and 10 archaeal mags with 80 completeness and 10 contamination from all the sludge samples phylogenetic analysis showed that bacterial mags were classified into 15 phyla and they were most taxonomically assigned to proteobacteria 56 followed by bacteroidota 49 firmicutes 43 actinobacteriota 32 chloroflexota 28 verrucomicrobiota 13 and acidobacteriota 11 fig 4 a all the archaeal mags recovered were grouped into methanogens fig s7 44 out of 295 mags 15 were identified as antibiotic resistant hosts in which 9 and 5 encode resistance to single and multiple classes of antibiotics respectively these hosts of args belonged to nine phyla with proteobacteria 17 actinobacteriota 12 and firmicutes 6 being dominant the co occurrence of resistant mags with mges i e the mobility potential was also summarized in table s10 compared with conjugative elements integrative 56 and transposable elements 62 were significantly chi square test p 0 05 and more frequently co occurred with args in the resistant hosts suggesting the important relationships between mobility and harboring resistance the functional characterization of mags derived from the seed subsystem category and its correlations to args and mges occurrence were evaluated rda showed a significant p 0 05 but low contribution 1 1 of args and 2 2 of mges to the function composition table s11 suggesting that the occurrence of args and mges could not be the main drivers for the function composition in the sludge treatment system nevertheless the resistance type categorized by drug class showed a relatively high percent variation of 26 7 for function composition across the resistant mags table s11 the core functions among the resistant mags are the pathways relative to the microbial growth i e metabolic functions such as the carbohydrates amino acids and derivatives dna metabolism and membrane transport fig 4b suggesting the fundamental functions and their redundancy in the biological system for sludge treatment it was noteworthy that four resistant mags that belong to phylum firmicutes had high feature counts of dormancy and sporulation pathways among them two were assigned to the genera clostridium and paraclostridium indicating that they could be resistant to the sludge treatment process and might persist in the biosolids when receiving to the environment additionally butanoate metabolism pathways were compared based on two examples of resistant mags fig s8 bin 127 and bin 1081 feature all the central enzymes and complexes of acidogenesis indicating their capability of organic matter degradation in sludge digestion args located on mags are categorized into five resistance mechanisms including efflux inactivation target alteration target protection and target replacement although the variation of function composition was not significantly explained by the resistance mechanism p 0 05 table s11 the feature counts of certain function categories were found to be significantly different p 0 05 between resistance mechanisms fig s9 such as amino acids and derivatives and membrane transport pathway indicating the potential correlations of microbial metabolic function to resistant functions 4 discussion mitigating the dissemination of antibacterial resistance before discharging biosolids into the environment is the responsibility of cstps for public health in this study the variations of intracellular and extracellular resistome of sludge across the treatment steps were evaluated using quantitative metagenomic approaches the identity mobility and core functions of resistant hosts in the biological treatment system of sludge were also explored as hypothesized sludge treatment steps differentially affected the variations of args in idna and edna both abundance metrics i e relative or absolute of args had shown the interaction effects between dna fraction and treatment process table s8 the raw sludge undergoes two consecutive treatment steps excluding one plant with three steps by adding a thermal hydrolysis reactor and their roles in sludge processing were different with corresponding parameters e g temperature duration etc the viscosity of high solid sludge 20 of total solid was first reduced in a pulper operated at a high temperature 80 85 c and a short retention time 30 min the pulper unit significantly increased the amount of args in the edna fraction while the reduction of iargs was not obvious this may occur because the iargs were released into the extracellular environment under the high temperature condition and the amount of released iargs was one order of magnitude higher compared to initial eargs however a small release of iargs did not significantly affect the initial amount of iargs suggesting the low conversion efficiency of idna to edna under the pulping operation a recent study found that high processing temperature was beneficial for the release of idna and the removal of iargs cai et al 2022 when the args amount was normalized by 16s rrna genes no significant changes in both iargs and eargs were found in the pulped sludge samples compared with raw sludge it was due to the simultaneous release and similar conversion performance of intracellular 16s rrna genes along with iargs after the pulping pretreatment the pulped sludge is digested in a mesophilic reactor 37 c to allow the removal of organic matter and stabilization the abundance of eargs returned to a comparable level of raw sludge after the digestion it was reported that the eargs were susceptible to degradation by dnases rather than propagation through transformation in anaerobic conditions cai et al 2022 zou et al 2020 the total amount of iargs was also significantly removed 29 0 by the ad unit but was still dominant in the produced biosolids compared with eargs the decrease in iargs could be explained by the reduced biomass after digestion the organic matter degradation 30 was comparable with the iargs reduction a considerable part of influent bacteria including resistant hosts could not survive in the digester miller et al 2016 this is not surprising given that digesters rely on a symbiotic balance among communities of hydrolytic fermentative and methanogenic microorganisms these results are in line with the reported studies in which the removal efficiency of args ranged from 20 to 90 depending on the pretreatment or the ad operating conditions ju et al 2016 wang li and zhao 2019 xue et al 2019 for the relative abundance eargs showed a significant reduction including most classes of resistance genes figs 1 and 2a the decrease in relative abundance was likely due to the differential degradation of various extracellular genetic materials i e eargs and 16s rrna genes contrastly total iargs were not enriched in the bacterial cells fig 1 although enrichment of certain class args e g fluoroquinolone was observed fig 2 the mitigation of some gene classes was also observed in idna which could explain the statistical non significance of the total relative abundance of the resistome these results revealed that the sludge treatment process differentially influenced the variations of intracellular and extracellular resistome however the iargs are still abundant in the biosolids indicating that the cstps would release integral resistant microbial entities into the receiving environment they deserve the foremost research attention because of the capacity for the enrichment and widespread ecological associations once the produced biosolids would be applied for land use our second hypothesis stating that the resistome composition would be affected by both the treatment process and dna fraction was not confirmed although the conversion from idna to edna changed the arg flow between the treatment units compositional variations of resistome were not significantly impacted by the dna fractions table s9 our data also showed that the richness of eargs was also equal to that of iargs fig s3a these results may be because of whether the intracellular dna or the extracellular free dna was susceptible to non selective mitigation or enrichment furthermore there were no interaction effects between dna fraction and treatment steps on resistome composition suggesting compositional convergence of eargs and iargs among various treatment units zhou et al 2019 revealed that there was no significant difference in the diversity between iargs and eargs in the aeration tank activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants however the discrimination of eargs and iargs profiles can be found in soil and sediment environments which might correlate with the type of surrounding physical and genetic i e chromosomes or plasmids borne environment for args mao et al 2014 in this study the compositional convergence of eargs and iargs across treatment units i e pulper and digestor could be explained by more strongly temporal succession of both resistome and microbiome in the biotechnology than natural environment system the biological treatment unit e g digestion and aeration could be considered as a constrained environment with high microbial diversity in which microbes can be active in the exchange of genetic information and release of genetic matierals in the contrast the treatment process significantly influenced the resistome composition along with the microbial community structure fig 3 ju et al 2019 found that the richness and abundance of resistance genes vary greatly in different treatment compartments and yuan et al 2021 further revealed the cross compartment distribution of potential pathogenic populations in wwtps the different treatment reactors played a specific role in shaping the functional community revealing patterns of functional community structuring including resistome across environmental gradients louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 it was found that the resistome composition correlated significantly with the bacterial community composition fig s6 suggesting the taxonomic role in determining the sludge resistome the other biotic factors including mobility elements also play an important role in shaping compositional variations of resistomes the variances of resistome compositions were well explained by all three classes of mges 29 5 35 7 table 1 this proportion is comparable to the levels in activated sludge systems 26 35 ju et al 2019 and contaminated soils 40 47 hu et al 2017 these results revealed that the mges can strongly mobilize args in the sludge treatment process via horizontal gene transfer hgt which also occurs normally in natural ecosystems zarei baygi and smith 2021 many coexisting but taxonomically distinct microorganisms can encode the same antibacterial resistance functions e g sul1 gene wei et al 2021 indicating that bacterial phylogeny is not the only driver for the resistome composition the abiotic factors e g volatile solid and zinc in the cstps appear to play an additional role in shaping sludge resistomes the nutrients removal biomass content or the concentration of heavy metals may act as driving forces for both bacterial community and resistome composition many studies have found the extensive existence of resistant hosts in the sludge digestion system shi et al 2021 syafiuddin and boopathy 2021 tian et al 2016 prompting speculation that resistant hosts would possess the core metabolic functions in the biological reactors our work supported this hypothesis 44 mags were identified as antibiotic resistant hosts encoding resistance to both single and multiple classes of antibiotics among these resistant hosts carbohydrates and amino acids and derivatives pathways were most encoded in addition the resistant hosts could feature all the genes necessary for the butanoate metabolism suggesting that they were involved in the acidogenesis of sludge digestion the phylogenetic relationships among the resistant hosts also confirmed their functional roles in hydrolysis and acidogenesis with proteobacteria and actinobacteriota being dominant phyla fig 4a these predominant phyla have been reported as organic degrading bacteria and the main potential resistant host in the mesophilic digesters zamanzadeh et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 revealing that the resistant hosts have their specific niche and perform the key functions in the biological treatment system interestingly the phylum actinobacteriota is likely to carry more args multiple resistance fig 4a which may be due to their physiological characteristics the multiple resistance mechanisms in actinobacteriota include efflux and target replacement in this study although multiple antibiotic resistance was reported in actinobacteriota e g actinoplanes sp collinsella aerofaciens in human infections fatahi bafghi 2019 the reason for encoding multiple resistance of actinobacteriota in the mesophilic digesters needs to be further investigated furthermore the correlations between antibiotic resistance and the feature counts of core functions were explored using the high quality resistant mags we observed that the variation of 26 7 for function composition was attributed to the arg class indicating that args might take part in the physiological functions of microorganisms among the arg classes the multidrug category was found to be prevalent 21 out of 44 mags and its resistance mechanism is mainly efflux 18 out of 21 mags moreover the feature counts of certain function categories e g amino acids and derivatives and membrane transport pathways were found to be p 0 05 significantly higher in efflux than other resistance mechanisms fig s9 these results indicated that the microorganism encodes genes for efflux pumps not only for moving the antibiotics out of the cell but also for other natural physiological functions it was reported that the efflux system has a physiologic role in pumping out bacterial metabolites and signal compounds amaral et al 2014 additionally the primary transporters for efflux pumps are energy dependent directly utilizing atp as the energy source to drive transport du et al 2018 therefore the efflux pump is likely associated with energy metabolism i e substrate level phosphorylation in sludge digestion that could generate appropriate energy for physiological functions in addition to the efflux mechanism the resistance mechanism of target protection was found to have a higher feature count in dormancy and sporulation pathways suggesting the potential relationships between the antibiotic determinants and sporulation properties zidaric et al 2012 one of the great concerns is to assess the health risk of args in the receiving environment although an omic based framework considering human associated enrichment gene mobility and host pathogenicity was recently developed zhang et al 2021 the relationships between the abundance of resistance genes and the spread risk remain unclear our current priority is to control the total amount of antibacterial resistance determinants in produced biosolids and the receiving environment fortunately our data underscore that the richness improvement of relative abundance of the args was not observed in the digested sludge cstps played a positive role in reducing the absolute amounts of resistant bacteria and genes which is heavily dependent on the reduction of bacterial biomass nonetheless the intracellular resistance genes resistant hosts are still abundant after the anaerobic digestion suggesting that how to remove the resistant hosts and mitigate their transmission risk is our future direction on the other hand the limitation of this study is the lack of transcriptional activities of the resistome future work would benefit from quantitative transcriptomics and provide deep insights into the extent of antibacterial resistance in the interface between the anthropogenic and natural environments which would inform policy decisions in risk assessment and resistance surveillance for preventing the dissemination of antibacterial resistance to the environment 5 conclusions this study systematically investigated the fate of intracellular and extracellular resistome across different treatment units in cstps the differential flows of iargs and eargs were observed with iargs being abundant in the produced biosolids furthermore the treatment process significantly influenced the resistome composition along with the microbial community structure however compositional convergence of iargs and eargs across treatment units indicated the strong succession of microbiome and exchange of genetic materials the mag based analysis demonstrated that the arg hosts were taxonomically diverse and had a pronounced multiple resistance pattern in actinobacteriota besides these resistant hosts showed correlations to certain functional traits indicating that they could possess not only biological organic removal functions but also arg related physiological processes this comprehensive study could enhance our understanding of sludge resistome fate and functionality of resistant hosts in cstps shedding light on the risk assessment and management of antibiotic resistance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15683,due to the non homogeneous and multiphase nature of anaerobic lagoon constituents cfd modelling for process optimisation requires continuous functions for shear and solid liquid separation properties across a large range of solids concentrations unfortunately measurement of existing material properties of anaerobic sludges is limited to only shear or solid liquid separation or to a limited solids concentration in this work the shear properties of an anaerobic sludge were measured from 0 4 to 12 5 vol which corresponds to the solids concentrations seen in lagoons the sludge showed newtonian behaviour at 0 4 vol and herschel bulkley yield stress fluid behaviour for higher concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 12 vol we compared multiple approaches to determine relationships between the model fitting parameters of consistency k flow index n and shear yield stress τy with solids volume fraction ϕ the solid liquid separation properties were measured from sedimentation and filtration experiments to obtain compressibility and permeability properties across all the above mentioned concentrations enabling development of hindered velocity sedimentation curves comparison to full scale anaerobic digestate identified that the pilot lagoon sludge had faster sedimentation at a given solids concentration in comparison to the digestate this is the first study on simultaneous rheological characterisation and solid liquid separation behaviour of an anaerobic sludge across a wide range of concentrations thus enabling cfd modelling of the hydrodynamics and performance of anaerobic lagoons graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lagoon anaerobic digested sludge shear rheology solid liquid separation parameter estimation data availability all data is available in figshare at 10 6084 m9 figshare 19074614 v1 1 introduction anaerobic lagoons are in ground structures used for treatment of raw wastewater through sedimentation of suspended solids and anaerobic digestion of sediment and soluble organics to generate methane they offer several advantages over conventional mesophilic anaerobic or aerobic sludge treatment processes they do not require additional energy because the lagoon contents are not heated mixed or aerated as a result they are less expensive to construct and operate however due to the lack of mechanical mixing and temperature control they experience significant variation in operating conditions and performance papadopoulos et al 2003 solids behaviour in lagoons is a critical aspect of lagoon performance and long term operational costs ho et al 2017 they not only disrupt and adversely impact on hydrodynamic flows but also result in long term desludging costs current models describing solids accumulation are generally simple accumulation models vega et al 2003 computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling is used as a tool to investigate and optimize the performance of existing anaerobic digestion processes under normal operation as well as extreme wash out conditions and to ensure effective and energy efficient designs for new processes wu 2013 due to the limited mixing and the variation in hydrodynamics across the different zones in lagoons the lagoon constituents are non homogeneous in nature papadopoulos et al 2003 and subject to large gradients in solids concentration with depth ranging from as low as 1 mg l to thickened sludge of greater than 100 g l while cfd has been used to simulate the impact of sludge on hydrodynamics generally this has considered sludge structures as static with the fluid as newtonian vega et al 2003 the ability to simulate non newtonian rheology across a broad range of concentrations is critical to the development of an effective model and the requisite data is currently unavailable understanding the shear and solid liquid separation behaviour of the settled sludge layers plays an important role in predicting lagoon performance the aim is to maximise the sedimentation rate of suspended solids and the digestion rate of the organic fraction of the settled sludge and to reduce the cost of sludge handling and disposal the shear behaviour of sludge across the broad layered range of concentrations is described by the properties of shear yield stress and viscosity whereas the solid liquid separation behaviour is described by the properties of compressibility and permeability these properties are mostly dependant on the solids concentration of the sludge samples and are also influenced by the extent of digestion and temperature baroutian et al 2013 cao et al 2016 dentel 1997 eshtiaghi et al 2013 jiang and zhou 2020 markis et al 2014 2016 miryahyaei et al 2019 skinner et al 2015 ye et al 2014 the shear rheology of sewage sludge at very low solids concentrations is newtonian where the viscosity is constant with shear rate at low solids concentrations the newtonian viscosity increases with concentration sewage sludges demonstrate non newtonian shear thinning flow behaviour at higher concentrations due to structural changes caused by the flow at suspended solids concentrations above the gel point stickland 2015 sludges have a measurable shear yield stress due to a continuous particulate network several rheological models have been used to describe the non newtonian fluid behaviour of suspensions the power law model incorporates shear thinning behaviour and has been used for modelling sewage sludge rheology at lower solids concentrations cao et al 2016 yeneneh et al 2016 however for concentrated sewage sludge the herschel bulkley model is the most applicable model to describe the shear rheology markis et al 2014 2016 stickland et al 2013 this model has three fitting parameters which can be obtained from the best fit of the experimental shear stress and shear rate data to model the shear rheological behaviour of the sludge optimisation algorithms are used to find a set of model parameters that best describe a set of experimental rheograms in general the model fitting parameters are considered to be functions of solids concentration ratkovich et al 2013 it is very important to ensure the quality of the model parameters as they might suffer from limitations such as identifiability problems especially in an over parameterized model ratkovich et al 2013 the quality of parameter estimation can be judged from the confidence intervals of the respective parameter estimates when acceptably small confidence intervals are obtained the extracted parameters are more trustworthy and the resulting model will have higher predictive power parameter correlation should also be considered with flow index n often correlated to consistency k and shear yield stress τy in the herschel bulkley model petersen et al 2008 rosenberger et al 2002 in this study the shear rheological properties of anaerobically digested sludge were measured from 0 4 to 12 5 vol which corresponds to the solids concentrations observed in lagoons multiple approaches were tried to predict reliable relationships between the power law and herschel bulkley model fitting parameters

the cessation of flow nguyen and boger 1983 2 2 dewatering behaviour of sewage sludge due to the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps which are responsible for water retention and strong water binding capability wastewater sludges have poor dewaterability compared to other materials eps generally consists of mostly proteins and polysaccharides compared with primary sludge digested sludge contains relatively higher amount of eps which results in poor dewaterability performance christensen et al 2015 hong et al 2018 skinner et al 2015 the data indicate that higher volatile solids content in the range of 60 80 is an indicator of poor dewatering behaviour of sewage sludge hong et al 2018 skinner et al 2015 gravity batch settling tests are used to characterise dewaterability at low solids concentrations and slightly beyond the gel point lester et al 2005 whereas single pressure filtration tests are conducted for characterisation at high solids concentration to obtain the compressibility and permeability of sludge stickland 2015 stickland et al 2008 the compressive yield stress py ϕ where ϕ is the solids volume fraction provides a measure of the network resistance to deformation or the solids pressure required to consolidate to a given equilibrium volume fraction the gel point denoted by ϕg is defined as the solids concentration at which the solids form a sludge network to resist the applied pressure such that py ϕ 0 the hindered settling function r ϕ which is inversely related to the settling rate or the permeability is a measure of the hydrodynamic resistance stickland 2015 stickland et al 2008 usher et al 2013 the solids diffusivity d ϕ defines the rate at which a concentration gradient propagates through the suspension and is related to the compressive yield stress and hindered settling function by eq 3 stickland et al 2008 3 d ϕ d p y ϕ d ϕ 1 ϕ 2 r ϕ the solids diffusivity increases monotonically with solids concentration for inorganic materials leading to traditional quadratic filtration behaviour for wastewater sludges however the solids diffusivity initially increases but then decreases after a peak at low solids concentrations leading to non quadratic time versus filtrate volume behaviour where there is a very short linear cake formation period followed by a longer cake compression stickland et al 2005 the solid liquid separation parameters compressive yield stress py ϕ and hindered settling function r ϕ can be used to predict the compressive settling behaviour of the sludge at different solids concentrations the settling velocity profile of the sludge can also be predicted as a function of solids volume fractions from eq 4 using r ϕ and the solid and liquid densities and then be used as an input for cfd

progressively diluted with the centrate to a minimum of 0 4 vol 3 2 measurement of shear rheology 3 2 1 shear yield stress measurement the shear yield stresses of the anaerobic sludge samples were measured with a haake vt 550 rheometer using the vane in large cup method nguyen and boger 1992 the sample was placed in a container diameter 40 mm and length 80 mm and an appropriate vane diameter 15 mm and length 40 mm attached to the rheometer was immersed in the sample the vane was then rotated at a rate of 0 2 rpm and the shear yield stress was calculated from the maximum torque response and the vane geometry the samples were hand mixed prior to loading and kept at equilibrium for 5 min prior to commencement of measurement at 20 c 3 2 2 flow curve measurement flow curve measurements were conducted using a vane in cup wide gap or cylindrical bob in cup narrow gap geometry depending on its solid concentrations using a ta instruments ar g2 rheometer the vane in cup wide gap geometry was used for samples with solids concentrations above 4 vol whereas the bob in cup narrow gap geometry was used for samples with lower solids concentrations the detailed geometries of the cup and vane and cup and bob arrangements are provided in table 2 the samples were hand mixed and loaded in the cup the vane or bob was immersed in the sample and kept at equilibrium for 5 min then a logarithmic distribution of angular velocity from 100 rad s to 0 01 rad s was applied and torque values were recorded at 30 s intervals this technique was applied instead of increasing the angular velocity in ascending order because in the latter technique longer time is needed to reach steady state torque at a single angular velocity for the narrow gap geometry using the bob in cup the shear stress and shear rate values were calculated from the angular velocity torque and bob and cup geometry from eqs 8 and 9 8 τ t 2 π l b r b 2 9 γ 2 ω r c 2 r c 2 r b 2 where t torque n m lb length of bob m rb

logarithmic curve of shear stress versus angular velocity using eq 12 krieger and maron 1952 nguyen and boger 1992 a cubic fit for the logarithmic curve of shear stress versus angular velocity was used to calculate the local gradient 12 γ 2 ω n where n local gradient of the logarithmic plot of shear stress versus angular velocity 3 3 measurement of dewaterability gravitational batch settling tests were used to extract dewaterability data at low solids concentrations whereas several single pressure filtration tests were used to determine dewaterability data at high solids concentrations in a gravity settling test the decrease of the solid liquid interface over time was recorded whereas time versus filtrate volume data was generated from the single pressure filtration tests 3 3 1 batch settling tests the settling tests were conducted at lower concentrations than as received sludge by diluting the samples with their own liquor down to 0 8 0 9 vol solids volume fraction 0 008 0 009 so that a clearly defined solid liquid interface was observable the samples were poured into a 500 ml measuring cylinder and the solid liquid interfacial height was recorded over time the analytical method for determining hindered settling function r ϕ as a function of solids concentration the gel point ϕg and compressibility py ϕ data near the gel point from the batch settling data is reported in lester et al 2005 3 3 2 single pressure filtration tests at least two single pressure filtration tests between 50 kpa and 300 kpa were conducted for each sample in a constant pressure filtration device de kretser et al 2001 to have reliable dewatering data a known amount of sludge 100 ml was added to the filtration device and the filtration was continued until the filtrate volume reached equilibrium the extraction of the dewatering parameters from the pressure filtration data was conducted using the method described in stickland et al 2008 3 3 3 combining solid liquid separation data into curve fits the methods for combining the analysed data from the gravity batch settling and the pressure filtration tests into curve fits are presented in usher et al 2013 and mercer et al 2021 the detailed explanations of the analytical methods and curve fits are also provided in supplementary 1 3 4 parameter estimation the three parameters used in the herschel bulkley model were fitted to individual rheology curves simultaneously using the secant method lsqcurvefit in matlab r2018b with uncertainty 95 ci and correlation determined from the parameter residual jacobian linear approximation non log residuals were used as objective functions with log10 residuals also tested and found not to result in substantive differences in parameters true parameter confidence region was also evaluated by an f test non linear anova batstone et al 2009 to identify that the linear approximation was appropriate from the aggregate parameter variation in solids concentration models were proposed and optimised for fitting parameters using all data in that range with non log residuals as optimum an f test as above was used to determine confidence in parameters all data is stored in figshare das et al 2022 4 results 4 1 shear rheological behaviour as noted above all flow curves were fit using a herschel bulkley model and parameters analysed for variation across all ranges at solids concentration of 0 4 solids volume fraction ϕ 0 004 and presumably below the flow behaviour is newtonian the measured viscosity at 0 4 vol ϕ 0 004 is 0 00169 pa s which is almost twice the viscosity of water of 0 001 pa s at solids concentrations above 0 4 vol ϕ 0 004 the fluid flow behaviour changes from newtonian to shear thinning i e n 1 and above 0 7 vol ϕ 0 007 there was a measurable i e significant yield stress the flow curves for the sludge samples with solids volume fraction from 0 5 to 12 0 vol ϕ 0 005 0 12 with optimal hb fits are provided in fig 1 a and 1 b the flow curves were generally comparable across different concentrations except the 2 1 vol ϕ 0 021 which had high levels of variability at low shear rates and the 12 vol ϕ 0 12 which had an apparent high n compared to other samples likely due to development of secondary flows at high shear rates the shear yield stress τy variation with solid concentration is shown in fig 1 c as noted above there was a significant shear yield stress at solid concentrations higher than 0 74 vol ϕ 0 0074 with the function generally following a power law model with the exception for the two lowest concentrations of 0 53 and 0 74 vol ϕ 0 0053 and 0 0074 for there was a large variation between the hb individual fit and predicted shear yield stress values from the power law curve fit the consistency k values varied by orders of magnitude between concentration ranges and was modelled as a power law function across the entire range of solids concentrations fig 1d the flow behaviour index n decreased from close to 1 at 0 5 vol ϕ 0 005 to a relatively constant value of 0 35 above 4 vol ϕ 0 04 fig 1e an exponential decay model was used to predict n across the entire range the optimised models and model fit details are provided in table 3 4 2 characterisation of solid liquid separation behaviour the solid liquid separation behaviour of the sludge is described by the compressive yield stress hindered settling function and solids diffusivity these material parameters were measured using batch sedimentation and pressure filtration and were predicted as continuous functions of solids volume fraction from curve fitting to both experimental results of the sedimentation and pressure filtration the settling velocity as a continuous function of the solids volume fraction is required as an input into the cfd modelling of the lagoon which was calculated from the hindered settling function solids volume fraction and the solids and liquid density values the experimental and predicted solid liquid separation parameters for the digested sludges from the pilot plant non homogenised lagoon system and the mesophilic anaerobic digester homogenised digester system are provided in figs 2 4 the compressive yield stress values for both the sludges vary by five orders of magnitude over the solids concentration range from 2 vol to 40 vol ϕ 0 02 to 0 4 fig 2 the constitutive equations for the prediction of compressive yield stress of the digested sludges from pilot plant are provided in eqs 13 and 14 and the mesophilic anaerobic digester are provided in eqs 15 and 16 13 p y ϕ p y 1 ϕ 0 113

to 1017 kg s 1m 3 the hindered settling function for both types of sludges were predicted as power law functions of solid volume fraction ϕ as provided in eq 17 for pilot plant sludge and eq 18 for mesophilic anaerobic digester sludge 17 r ϕ 2 294 10 18 ϕ 5 265 18 r ϕ 1 294 10 20 ϕ 5 672 the predicted solids diffusivity d ϕ profile across the entire range of solids concentration of 2 to 40 vol ϕ 0 02 to 0 4 and the experimental d ϕ values obtained from pressure filtration tests are presented in fig 5 the experimental values were calculate from the fitting parameters of filtration curve as described in stickland et al 2008 the d ϕ profile was obtained by combining the predicted compressive yield stress py ϕ and hindered settling function r ϕ using eq 3 this non monotonic d ϕ behaviour is typical for wastewater sludges as described in section 2 2 due to the extended compression zone which has been attributed to the extracellular polymeric network mercer et al 2021 skinner et al 2015 stickland et al 2008 in general materials with a compressibility curve at higher solids for a given pressure and with a lower hindered settling or drag at the same pressure will dewater faster and further skinner et al 2015 from the hindered settling profile fig 3 it appears that the digested sludge from the pilot plant dewaters faster than that from the full scale mesophilic anaerobic digester similar observation can be made based on the settling velocity profile for the two sludges provided in fig 5 the pilot plant sludge settled faster compared to the digested sludge from the full scale digester homogeneous across the entire range of solids volume fraction which indicates the need for specific characterisation of samples rather than generic sedimentation curves this can be attributed to higher volatile solids generation of fines during anaerobic digestion and consequently higher eps content for the full scale digester sludge in addition at the same solids volume fraction the shear yield stress values for the digested sludge from the mesophilic full scale homogenised digester are significantly higher than that for the pilot plant sludge which is a non homogenised system fig 2 all of these observations can be attributed to the relatively higher vs content 71 of ts of the sludge from the full scale digester compared to the lower vs content 61 of ts of the pilot plant sample the volatile solids content of the sludge is considered a surrogate for eps which is believed to be responsible for difficulty in dewatering of wastewater sludges skinner et al 2015 the settling velocity of the lagoon sludge as a continuous function of solids volume fractions can be used as an input for the cfd modelling of anaerobic lagoon process 5 conclusions this study develops continuous constitutive relationships for rheology and solid liquid separation for large solids gradient materials cfd modelling this has been primarily focused on lagoon sludges but has applicability to anaerobic digestate and primary solids the results showed newtonian behaviour to occur at 0 4 vol in the range of 0 5 12 vol the sludge behaved as a herschel bulkley fluid with shear yield stress τy and consistency k as power law functions and flow index n as an exponential decay function of the solids volume fraction ϕ the dewaterability data indicated substantial differences in pilot lagoon sludge from a full scale mesophilic anaerobic digester most importantly the latter had higher values of hindered settling function at a given solids content as the pilot plant indicating poorer dewaterability and slower sedimentation overall this work provides for the first time a complete set of rheological properties of an anaerobic lagoon sludge including the rates and extent to which the sludge will settle and consolidate as well as its viscous response declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing interest acknowledgment tanmoy das acknowledges the

15683,due to the non homogeneous and multiphase nature of anaerobic lagoon constituents cfd modelling for process optimisation requires continuous functions for shear and solid liquid separation properties across a large range of solids concentrations unfortunately measurement of existing material properties of anaerobic sludges is limited to only shear or solid liquid separation or to a limited solids concentration in this work the shear properties of an anaerobic sludge were measured from 0 4 to 12 5 vol which corresponds to the solids concentrations seen in lagoons the sludge showed newtonian behaviour at 0 4 vol and herschel bulkley yield stress fluid behaviour for higher concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 12 vol we compared multiple approaches to determine relationships between the model fitting parameters of consistency k flow index n and shear yield stress τy with solids volume fraction ϕ the solid liquid separation properties were measured from sedimentation and filtration experiments to obtain compressibility and permeability properties across all the above mentioned concentrations enabling development of hindered velocity sedimentation curves comparison to full scale anaerobic digestate identified that the pilot lagoon sludge had faster sedimentation at a given solids concentration in comparison to the digestate this is the first study on simultaneous rheological characterisation and solid liquid separation behaviour of an anaerobic sludge across a wide range of concentrations thus enabling cfd modelling of the hydrodynamics and performance of anaerobic lagoons graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lagoon anaerobic digested sludge shear rheology solid liquid separation parameter estimation data availability all data is available in figshare at 10 6084 m9 figshare 19074614 v1 1 introduction anaerobic lagoons are in ground structures used for treatment of raw wastewater through sedimentation of suspended solids and anaerobic digestion of sediment and soluble organics to generate methane they offer several advantages over conventional mesophilic anaerobic or aerobic sludge treatment processes they do not require additional energy because the lagoon contents are not heated mixed or aerated as a result they are less expensive to construct and operate however due to the lack of mechanical mixing and temperature control they experience significant variation in operating conditions and performance papadopoulos et al 2003 solids behaviour in lagoons is a critical aspect of lagoon performance and long term operational costs ho et al 2017 they not only disrupt and adversely impact on hydrodynamic flows but also result in long term desludging costs current models describing solids accumulation are generally simple accumulation models vega et al 2003 computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling is used as a tool to investigate and optimize the performance of existing anaerobic digestion processes under normal operation as well as extreme wash out conditions and to ensure effective and energy efficient designs for new processes wu 2013 due to the limited mixing and the variation in hydrodynamics across the different zones in lagoons the lagoon constituents are non homogeneous in nature papadopoulos et al 2003 and subject to large gradients in solids concentration with depth ranging from as low as 1 mg l to thickened sludge of greater than 100 g l while cfd has been used to simulate the impact of sludge on hydrodynamics generally this has considered sludge structures as static with the fluid as newtonian vega et al 2003 the ability to simulate non newtonian rheology across a broad range of concentrations is critical to the development of an effective model and the requisite data is currently unavailable understanding the shear and solid liquid separation behaviour of the settled sludge layers plays an important role in predicting lagoon performance the aim is to maximise the sedimentation rate of suspended solids and the digestion rate of the organic fraction of the settled sludge and to reduce the cost of sludge handling and disposal the shear behaviour of sludge across the broad layered range of concentrations is described by the properties of shear yield stress and viscosity whereas the solid liquid separation behaviour is described by the properties of compressibility and permeability these properties are mostly dependant on the solids concentration of the sludge samples and are also influenced by the extent of digestion and temperature baroutian et al 2013 cao et al 2016 dentel 1997 eshtiaghi et al 2013 jiang and zhou 2020 markis et al 2014 2016 miryahyaei et al 2019 skinner et al 2015 ye et al 2014 the shear rheology of sewage sludge at very low solids concentrations is newtonian where the viscosity is constant with shear rate at low solids concentrations the newtonian viscosity increases with concentration sewage sludges demonstrate non newtonian shear thinning flow behaviour at higher concentrations due to structural changes caused by the flow at suspended solids concentrations above the gel point stickland 2015 sludges have a measurable shear yield stress due to a continuous particulate network several rheological models have been used to describe the non newtonian fluid behaviour of suspensions the power law model incorporates shear thinning behaviour and has been used for modelling sewage sludge rheology at lower solids concentrations cao et al 2016 yeneneh et al 2016 however for concentrated sewage sludge the herschel bulkley model is the most applicable model to describe the shear rheology markis et al 2014 2016 stickland et al 2013 this model has three fitting parameters which can be obtained from the best fit of the experimental shear stress and shear rate data to model the shear rheological behaviour of the sludge optimisation algorithms are used to find a set of model parameters that best describe a set of experimental rheograms in general the model fitting parameters are considered to be functions of solids concentration ratkovich et al 2013 it is very important to ensure the quality of the model parameters as they might suffer from limitations such as identifiability problems especially in an over parameterized model ratkovich et al 2013 the quality of parameter estimation can be judged from the confidence intervals of the respective parameter estimates when acceptably small confidence intervals are obtained the extracted parameters are more trustworthy and the resulting model will have higher predictive power parameter correlation should also be considered with flow index n often correlated to consistency k and shear yield stress τy in the herschel bulkley model petersen et al 2008 rosenberger et al 2002 in this study the shear rheological properties of anaerobically digested sludge were measured from 0 4 to 12 5 vol which corresponds to the solids concentrations observed in lagoons multiple approaches were tried to predict reliable relationships between the power law and herschel bulkley model fitting parameters

concentrations and slightly beyond the gel point lester et al 2005 whereas single pressure filtration tests are conducted for characterisation at high solids concentration to obtain the compressibility and permeability of sludge stickland 2015 stickland et al 2008 the solid liquid separation parameters compressive yield stress py ϕ and hindered settling function r ϕ can be used to predict the compressive settling behaviour of the sludge at different solids concentrations the settling velocity of the sludge can also be predicted as a function of solids volume fractions using r ϕ and the solid and liquid densities which can then be an input for cfd modelling studies conducted so far have characterised either the shear rheological or solid liquid separation behaviour of a sludge sample shear rheology and solid liquid separation behaviour has not been simultaneously studied this is the first study that presents the correlations for shear rheology and solid liquid separation properties as continuous functions across a wide range of solids volume fractions for an anaerobic sludge to be used as input for the cfd modelling of anaerobic lagoons these material properties enable cfd to predict the solids consolidation and flow profile within the anaerobic lagoon and their use for optimising process performance 2 theory 2 1 shear rheology of sewage sludge

shear rheology the samples were concentrated in a beckman coulter allegra x 12 centrifuge to a maximum solids concentration of 12 vol after centrifugation for 2 h at 3500 rpm the samples were then progressively diluted with the centrate to a minimum of 0 4 vol 3 2 measurement of shear rheology 3 2 1 shear yield stress measurement the shear yield stresses of the anaerobic sludge samples were measured with a haake vt 550 rheometer using the vane in large cup method nguyen and boger 1992 the sample was placed in a container diameter 40 mm and length 80 mm and an appropriate vane diameter 15 mm and length 40 mm attached to the rheometer was immersed in the sample the vane was then rotated at a rate of 0 2 rpm and the shear yield stress was calculated from the maximum torque response and the vane geometry the samples were hand mixed prior to loading and kept at equilibrium for 5 min prior to commencement of measurement at 20 c 3 2 2 flow curve measurement flow curve measurements were conducted using a vane in cup wide gap or cylindrical bob in cup narrow gap geometry depending on its solid concentrations using a ta instruments ar g2 rheometer the vane in cup wide gap geometry was used for samples with solids concentrations above 4 vol whereas the bob in cup narrow gap geometry was used for samples with lower solids concentrations the detailed geometries of the cup and vane and cup and bob arrangements are provided in table 2 the samples were hand mixed and loaded in the cup the vane or bob was immersed in the sample and kept at equilibrium for 5 min then a logarithmic distribution of angular velocity from 100 rad s to 0 01 rad s was applied and torque values were recorded at 30 s intervals this technique was applied instead of increasing the angular velocity in ascending order because in the latter technique longer time is needed to reach steady state torque at a single angular velocity for the narrow gap geometry using the bob in cup the shear stress and shear rate values were calculated from the angular velocity torque and bob and cup geometry from eqs 8 and 9 8 τ t 2 π l b r b 2 9 γ 2 ω r c 2 r c 2 r b 2 where t torque n m lb length of bob m rb radius of bob m ω angular velocity rad s and rc radius of cup m for the vane in cup wide gap geometry corrected shear stress and shear rate values were calculated from the measured angular velocity and torque data the corrected shear stress was calculated from the torque data and vane geometry using eq 10 nguyen and boger 1992 10 τ t k v where kv the vane constant given by eq 11 nguyen and boger 1992 11 k v π d v 2 l v 2 d v 6 where lv is the length of the vane m and dv is the diameter of the vane m the corrected shear rate was calculated from the angular velocity and local gradient of the logarithmic curve of shear stress versus angular velocity using eq 12 krieger and maron 1952 nguyen and boger 1992 a cubic fit for the logarithmic curve of shear stress versus angular velocity was used to calculate the local gradient 12 γ 2 ω n where n local gradient of the logarithmic plot of shear stress versus angular velocity 3 3 measurement of dewaterability gravitational batch settling tests were used to extract dewaterability data at low solids concentrations whereas several single pressure filtration tests were used to determine dewaterability data at high solids concentrations in a gravity settling test the decrease of the solid liquid interface over time was recorded whereas time versus filtrate volume data was generated from the single pressure filtration tests 3 3 1 batch settling tests the settling tests were conducted at lower concentrations than as received sludge by diluting the samples with their own liquor down to 0 8 0 9 vol solids volume fraction 0 008 0 009 so that a clearly defined solid liquid interface was observable the samples were poured into a 500 ml measuring cylinder and the solid liquid interfacial height was recorded over time the analytical method for determining hindered settling function r ϕ as a function of solids concentration the gel point ϕg and compressibility py ϕ data near the gel point from the batch settling data is reported in lester et al 2005 3 3 2 single pressure filtration tests at least two single pressure filtration tests between 50 kpa and 300 kpa were conducted for each sample in a constant pressure filtration device de kretser et al 2001 to have reliable dewatering data a known amount of sludge 100 ml was added to the filtration device and the filtration was continued until the filtrate volume reached equilibrium the extraction of the dewatering parameters from the pressure filtration data was conducted using the method described in stickland et al 2008 3 3 3 combining solid liquid separation data into curve fits the methods for combining the analysed data from the gravity batch settling and the pressure filtration tests into curve fits are presented in usher et al 2013 and mercer et al 2021 the detailed explanations of the analytical methods and curve fits are also provided in supplementary 1 3 4 parameter estimation the three parameters used in the herschel bulkley model were fitted to individual rheology curves simultaneously using the secant method lsqcurvefit in matlab r2018b with uncertainty 95 ci and correlation determined from the parameter residual jacobian linear approximation non log residuals were used as objective functions with log10 residuals also tested and found not to result in substantive differences in parameters true parameter confidence region was also evaluated by an f test non linear anova batstone et al 2009 to identify that the linear approximation was appropriate from the aggregate parameter variation in solids concentration models were proposed and optimised for fitting parameters using all data in that range with non log residuals as optimum an f test as above was used to determine confidence in parameters all data is stored in figshare das et al 2022 4 results 4 1 shear rheological behaviour as noted above all flow curves were fit using a herschel bulkley model and parameters analysed for variation across all ranges at solids concentration of 0 4 solids volume fraction ϕ 0 004 and presumably below the flow behaviour is newtonian the measured viscosity at 0 4 vol ϕ 0 004 is 0 00169 pa s which is almost twice the viscosity of water of 0 001 pa s at solids concentrations above 0 4 vol ϕ 0 004 the fluid flow behaviour changes from newtonian to shear thinning i e n 1 and above 0 7 vol ϕ 0 007 there was a measurable i e significant yield stress the flow curves for the sludge samples with solids volume fraction from 0 5 to 12 0 vol ϕ 0 005 0 12 with optimal hb fits are provided in fig 1 a and 1 b the flow curves were generally comparable across different concentrations except the 2 1 vol ϕ 0 021 which had high levels of variability at low shear rates and the 12 vol ϕ 0 12 which had an apparent high n compared to other samples likely due to development of secondary flows at high shear rates the shear yield stress τy variation with solid concentration is shown in fig 1 c as noted above there was a significant shear yield stress at solid concentrations higher than 0 74 vol ϕ 0 0074 with the function generally following a power law model with the exception for the two lowest concentrations of 0 53 and 0 74 vol ϕ 0 0053 and 0 0074 for there was a large variation between the hb individual fit and predicted shear yield stress values from the power law curve fit the consistency k values varied by orders of magnitude between concentration ranges and was modelled as a power law function across the entire range of solids concentrations fig 1d the flow behaviour index n decreased from close to 1 at 0 5 vol ϕ 0 005 to a relatively constant value of 0 35 above 4 vol ϕ 0 04 fig 1e an exponential decay model was used to predict n across the entire range the optimised models and model fit details are provided in table 3 4 2 characterisation of solid liquid separation behaviour the solid liquid separation behaviour of the sludge is described by the compressive yield stress hindered settling function and solids diffusivity these material parameters were measured using batch sedimentation and pressure filtration and were predicted as continuous functions of solids volume fraction from curve fitting to both experimental results of the sedimentation and pressure filtration the settling velocity as a continuous function of the solids volume fraction is required as an input into the cfd modelling of the lagoon which was calculated from the hindered settling function solids volume fraction and the solids and liquid density values the experimental and predicted solid liquid separation parameters for the digested sludges from the pilot plant non homogenised lagoon system and the mesophilic anaerobic digester homogenised digester system are provided in figs 2 4 the compressive yield stress values for both the sludges vary by five orders of magnitude over the solids concentration range from 2 vol to 40 vol ϕ 0 02 to 0 4 fig 2 the constitutive equations for the prediction of compressive yield stress of the digested sludges from pilot plant are provided in eqs 13 and 14 and the mesophilic anaerobic digester are provided in eqs 15 and 16 13 p y ϕ p y 1 ϕ 0 113 0 63 ϕ 0 01 ϕ 0 027 ϕ 0 027 3 371 0 027 ϕ 0 067 14 p y ϕ p y 2 ϕ 0 253 0 63 ϕ 0 01 ϕ 0 014 ϕ 0 027 4 797 0 066 ϕ 0 63 15 p y ϕ p y 1 ϕ 0 371 0 63 ϕ 0 01 ϕ 0 032 ϕ 0 032 5 779 0 032 ϕ 0 096 16 p y ϕ p y 2 ϕ 0 483 0 63 ϕ 0 01 ϕ 0 018 ϕ 0 032 6 910 0 096 ϕ 0 63 for the solids volume fraction range of 2 vol to 40 vol ϕ 0 02 to 0 4 the hindered settling function varies nine orders of magnitude from 108 to 1017 kg s 1m 3 the hindered settling function for both types of sludges were predicted as power law functions of solid volume fraction ϕ as provided in eq 17 for pilot plant sludge and eq 18 for mesophilic anaerobic digester sludge 17 r ϕ 2 294 10 18 ϕ 5 265 18 r ϕ 1 294 10 20 ϕ 5 672 the predicted solids diffusivity d ϕ profile across the entire range of solids concentration of 2 to 40 vol ϕ 0 02 to 0 4 and the experimental d ϕ values obtained from pressure filtration tests are presented in fig 5 the experimental values were calculate from the fitting parameters of filtration curve as described in stickland et al 2008 the d ϕ profile was obtained by combining the predicted compressive yield stress py ϕ and hindered settling function r ϕ using eq 3 this non monotonic d ϕ behaviour is typical for wastewater sludges as described in section 2 2 due to the extended compression zone which has been attributed to the extracellular polymeric network mercer et al 2021 skinner et al 2015 stickland et al 2008 in general materials with a compressibility curve at higher solids for a given pressure and with a lower hindered settling or drag at the same pressure will dewater faster and further skinner et al 2015 from the hindered settling profile fig 3 it appears that the digested sludge from the pilot plant dewaters faster than that from the full scale mesophilic anaerobic digester similar observation can be made based on the settling velocity profile for the two sludges provided in fig 5 the pilot plant sludge settled faster compared to the digested sludge from the full scale digester homogeneous across the entire range of solids volume fraction which indicates the need for specific characterisation of samples rather than generic sedimentation curves this can be attributed to higher volatile solids generation of fines during anaerobic digestion and consequently higher eps content for the full scale digester sludge in addition at the same solids volume fraction the shear yield stress values for the digested sludge from the mesophilic full scale homogenised digester are significantly higher than that for the pilot plant sludge which is a non homogenised system fig 2 all of these observations can be attributed to the relatively higher vs content 71 of ts of the sludge from the full scale digester compared to the lower vs content 61 of ts of the pilot plant sample the volatile solids content of the sludge is considered a surrogate for eps which is believed to be responsible for difficulty in dewatering of wastewater sludges skinner et al 2015 the settling velocity of the lagoon sludge as a continuous function of solids volume fractions can be used as an input for the cfd modelling of anaerobic lagoon process 5 conclusions this study develops continuous constitutive relationships for rheology and solid liquid separation for large solids gradient materials cfd modelling this has been primarily focused on lagoon sludges but has applicability to anaerobic digestate and primary solids the results showed newtonian behaviour to occur at 0 4 vol in the range of 0 5 12 vol the sludge behaved as a herschel bulkley fluid with shear yield stress τy and consistency k as power law functions and flow index n as an exponential decay function of the solids volume fraction ϕ the dewaterability data indicated substantial differences in pilot lagoon sludge from a full scale mesophilic anaerobic digester most importantly the latter had higher values of hindered settling function at a given solids content as the pilot plant indicating poorer dewaterability and slower sedimentation overall this work provides for the first time a complete set of rheological properties of an anaerobic lagoon sludge including the rates and extent to which the sludge will settle and consolidate as well as its viscous response declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing interest acknowledgment tanmoy das acknowledges the

15684,efficient removal of toxic hexavalent chromium cr vi under alkaline conditions is still a challenge due to the relatively low reactivity of cro4 2 this study proposed a new sulfite iodide uv process to remove cr vi the removal of cr vi followed pseudo zero order kinetics at alkaline phs and was enhanced by sulfite and iodide with synergy compared with sulfite uv iodide in sulfite iodide uv showed about 40 times higher concentration normalized enhancement for cr vi removal and reduced the requirement of sulfite s iv 0 cr vi 0 of about 2 1 1 by more than 90 the cr vi removal was accelerated by decreasing ph and by increasing temperature and was slightly influenced by dissolved oxygen carbonate and humic acid the process was still effective in real surface water and industrial wastewater mechanism and pathways of cr vi removal were revealed by quenching experiments competition kinetic analysis product identification and quantification and mass and electron balance both eaq and so3 were responsible for cr vi removal making contributions of about 75 and 25 respectively when eaq mainly reacted with cr vi so3 participated in reduction of cr v and cr iv intermediates with cr iii s2o6 2 and so4 2 as the final products a model was developed to predict removal kinetics of cr vi and well interpreted the roles of s iv and iodide in the process this study sheds light on mechanism of cr vi removal at alkaline phs by kinetic modeling and thus advances the applicability of this promising process for water decontamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cr vi sulfite iodide uv mechanism modeling hydrated electron sulfite radical data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chromium cr is a naturally occurring toxic heavy metal e g genotoxicity and carcinogenesis and is routinely determined in water and soil as a result of natural sources and anthropogenic activities guo et al 2020 nasemann et al 2020 the inevitable release of toxic cr into environment due to its wide applications in industry poses a great threat to ecology and public health wise et al 2022 the pollution of cr in aquatic environment has raised a great concern worldwide and many countries and regions have established stringent regulations for cr in drinking water e g 0 05 mg l 1 cr by who and discharge limits in wastewater bolisetty et al 2019 vaiopoulou and gikas 2020 the removal of cr has been studied extensively for decades and many methods have been developed such as coprecipitation chemical reduction electrocoagulation bioremediation electrocatalysis photoelectrocatalysis membrane filtration and adsorption bashir et al 2022 bolisetty et al 2019 pincus et al 2020 while cr is presently mostly in forms of trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi chromium the concerns with cr are primarily related to cr vi owing to its much higher mobility bioaccumulation and toxicity vaiopoulou and gikas 2020 as cr iii can be easily precipitated under alkaline conditions reduction of cr vi to cr iii is the pivotal step for efficient removal of cr vi from water and wastewater under acidic conditions the oxidizing activity of cr vi is strong e g e 0 hcro4 cr3 1 35 vnhe stern et al 2021 so the reduction of cr vi can be more easily achieved although the two step process cr vi reduction and cr iii precipitation is widely applied additional chemicals e g sulfuric acid lime and alkali are usually required to adjust ph for efficient reduction of cr vi at acidic phs and the following precipitation of cr iii as hydroxides kalidhasan et al 2016 stern et al 2021 thus simultaneous reduction of cr vi and precipitation of cr iii are highly desired xie et al 2017 however it is currently still a big challenge due to the much lower reactivity of cro4 2 weak electrostatic interaction with surface and formation of passivation layer e g cr oh 3 under alkaline conditions maitlo et al 2019 pincus et al

perfluorocarboxylates cui et al 2020 fennell et al 2022 li et al 2019 yang et al 2020 because of the relatively high efficiency innocuousness simplicity and potential feasibility of sulfite uv this process was considered as a promising method to produce eaq for decontamination cui et al 2020 fennell et al 2022 yang et al 2020 one step removal of cr vi under alkaline conditions could be achieved in sulfite uv xie et al 2017 however this process was still limited by low efficiency of eaq production and high demand of chemicals fennell et al 2022 li et al 2014 furthermore the mechanism and pathways of cr vi removal in particular the roles of reactive species e g eaq h and so3 and the conversion of intermediate cr species e g cr v and cr iv in the process are still not clear and kinetic modeling is also highly desirable fennell et al 2022 previous study showed that sulfite iodide uv process exhibited much higher efficiency in reductive dechlorination of monochloroacetic acid mcaa than the sulfite uv process yu et al 2018 by introducing a small amount several μm of iodide the generation of eaq and utilization of sulfite could be enhanced considerably and the influence of ph was also alleviated to a great extent hence it is expected that sulfite iodide uv will achieve much higher removal efficiency of cr vi under alkaline conditions to the best of our knowledge there has been no study on the mechanism and modeling of cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the removal of cr vi under alkaline conditions in sulfite iodide uv specifically focusing on 1 removal kinetics 2 influence of typical factors ph temperature s iv iodide dissolved oxygen and real water matrix 3 mechanism and 4 kinetic modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were at least of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification text s1 in supporting information deionized water was used to prepare solutions real surface water and industrial wastewater samples were collected from the qiantang river hangzhou section china and an industrial wastewater treatment plant in xianju zhejiang china respectively and were filtered by cellulose membrane 0 45 μm prior to experiments the characteristics of the water samples were summarized in table s1 2 2 experimental procedure the irradiation experiments were performed in a cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor 0 8 l with a uv lamp 10 w 253 7 nm gph212t5l heraeus noblelight vertically positioned in the center of the reactor the uv photon flux i 0 253 7 nm amount basis was about 2 43 μeinstein s 1 by ki kio3 method fig s1 rahn 1997 and the spatial average or effective path length of light l was about 4 08 cm according to photolysis kinetics of dilute h2o2 solution fig s2 more details were reported in our previous studies li et al 2014 2012 yu et al 2018 solution temperature was controlled by a thermostatic water recirculation system and solution ph was adjusted using borate 10 mm ph 8 11 and phosphate buffer 5 mm ph 5 8 the uv lamp was preheated at least 15 min prior to photochemical experiments and solutions were deoxygenated by purging n2 99 999 1 l min 1 for more than 15 min unless otherwise noted all experiments were repeated at least two times 2 3 analytical methods solution ph was measured with a ph meter pb 10 sartorius uv vis absorption of samples was analyzed on uv vis spectrophotometer t6 persee analytics the concentration of cr vi was determined by the absorption at 372 nm or by diphenylcarbazide complexation method at 540 nm for low centration 2 μm of cr vi loyaux lawniczak et al 2001 the concentrations of h2o2 were quantified by the i3 method at 352 nm klassen et al 1994 inorganic anions no3 cl i s2o6 2 so3 2 and so4 2 were analyzed on an ion chromatograph ics 90 dionex as described previously li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 the cod of wastewater was determined on a cod analyzer 5b 3f lian hua tech co ltd china and the total nitrogen tn was determined spectrophotometrically via alkaline potassium persulfate digestion method 2 4 kinetic modeling based on the steady state assumption the concentrations of transient species could be calculated and thus the kinetics of the corresponding reactions could be simply modeled using the chemical modeling software package kintecus version 2021 ianni 2003 a model involving all the reactions eqs 1 15 and reactions in table s2 was developed to simulate the kinetics of cr vi removal in the system most of the second order rate constants for the reactions were available from literature and sensitivity analysis and relative significance were conducted to estimate the values if not reported the initial conditions for simulation were in consistence with those in experiments the prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated using statistical parameters such as the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse more details in supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal kinetics of cr vi in sulfite iodide uv at alkaline ph cro4 2 is the dominant species of cr vi pk a1 0 75 and pk a2 6 45 fig s3 negligible removal of cr vi by s iv was observed within 30 min at alkaline phs via eq 1 fig s4 due to the relatively low oxidizing activity of cro4 2 e 0 cro4 2 cr oh 3 0 13 vnhe stern et al 2021 xie et al 2017 thus the fast reduction of cro4 2 is the critical step for cr vi removal under alkaline conditions 1 cro4 2 so3 2 cr v so3 k 1 0 03 m 1 s 1 this study fig 1 a shows removal of cr vi in three processes including iodide uv sulfite uv and sulfite iodide uv compared with negligible removal of cr vi by uv direct photolysis and iodide uv xie et al 2017 yeo et al 2012 about 32 of cr vi cr vi 0 100 μm was removed in sulfite uv 6 9 j cm 2 and about 95 removal was obtained in sulfite iodide uv 8 3 j cm 2 within 50 min at ph 9 2 the removal of cr vi in sulfite uv and sulfite iodide uv both followed pseudo zero rate kinetics fig 1a and fig s5a the cr vi removal rate r μm min 1 in sulfite iodide uv 2 39 μm min 1 was about 3 times higher than the sum of that in sulfite uv 0 78 μm min 1 and iodide uv 0 02 μm min 1 indicating a significant synergistic effect of sulfite and iodide in the process one tailed student s t test p 0 05 it seems that cr vi also showed significant uv light screening effect ε 254nm of 2622 m 1 cm 1 at ph 9 2 decreasing initial cr vi concentration from 200 μm to 5 μm not only enhanced the removal of cr vi from about 1 to about 60 within 1 min but also increased the removal rate from about 1 70 μm min 1 to about 2 45 μm min 1 fig s5b furthermore complete removal of the initial 1 μm cr vi could be readily achieved with 100 μm sulfite and 5 μm iodide within 8 min fig s6 thus the process showed good performance for cr vi removal at alkaline phs 3 2 effect of ph in sulfite iodide uv the removal ratio of cr vi was promoted from about 29 to about 100 within 15 min by decreasing ph from 10 1 to 7 0 fig s7 and a sudden jump of cr vi removal rate from about 4 2 μm min 1 at ph 7 7 to about 8 1 μm min 1 at ph 7 0 occurred fig 2 a the similar influence of ph on cr vi removal was also observed in sulfite uv xie et al 2017 increasing ph favors the generation of eaq and helps mitigate scavenging of species by competing reactions eqs s1 s3 li et al 2014 however the negative ph dependency of cr vi removal kinetics was observed this may be ascribed to the change of species distribution of cr vi decreasing ph promotes conversion of cro4 2 to hcro4 fig s3 which has much higher oxidizing activity stern et al 2021 and thus hso3 and other mild reactive species e g so3 are possibly involved in reaction with hcro4 instead of cro4 2 eq 2 dong et al 2020 also hcro4 has weaker uv absorption than cro4 2 2086 m 1 cm 1 vs 2622 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm and exhibits a less uv light screening effect so decreasing ph promoted removal of cr vi in sulfite iodide uv 2 hcro4 hso3 cr v so3 h k 2 15 68 m 1 s 1 3 3 effect of temperature increasing temperature accelerated cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv fig s8a and the apparent activation e a was estimated to be about 40 7 kj mol 1 using arrhenius equation fig s8b the e a in sulfite iodide uv was higher than that in sulfite uv 31 7 kj mol 1 li et al 2014 interestingly cr vi removal rate r exhibited a better linear dependence on temperature fig 2b generally temperature influences effective quantum yields of photolysis processes by not only governing the viscosity of water but also determining the rate constants of the photofragments recombination reactions herrmann 2007 sauer et al 2004 assuming the complete capture of reactive species by cr vi in the process which is supported by the pseudo zero order kinetics of cr iv removal r can indicate the generation rate of reactive species thus the linear relationship in fig 2b also suggests that effective quantum yields of reactive species in sulfite iodide uv were linearly dependent upon temperature actually t dependences of effective quantum yields do not have to correspond to the arrhenius form herrmann 2007 and the similar linear t dependence of quantum yields was also observed in the photolysis of iodide 3 45 10 3 k 1 sulfite 3 68 10 3 k 1 and oh 3 10 3 k 1 crowell et al 2004 li et al 2014 rahn 1997 3 4 effect of s iv as shown in fig 3 a cr vi removal was enhanced from 0 to almost 100 within 20 min by increasing s iv concentration so2 h2o hso3 and so3 2 fig s3 from 0 to 10 mm the final removal ratio of cr vi was determined by initial s iv concentration and cr vi cr vi 0 100 μm could not be completely removed when s iv concentration was lower than 200 μm thus s iv may play an important role in sustaining the continuous removal of cr vi in sulfite iodide uv the relationship between cr vi removal kinetics and s iv concentration was further analyzed fig 3b about 25 μm accelerated the cr vi removal rate r sharply from about 0 μm min 1 to 1 66 μm min 1 phase i while further increasing s iv concentration to 10 mm only resulted in much weaker enhancement on the rate slope of 3 93 10 4 min 1 phase ii actually the similar two phase relationship was also observed in dechlorination of mcaa in the process yu et al 2018 the linear dependence of r on s iv concentration phase ii fig 3b was very close to that in sulfite uv slope of 4 61 10 4 min 1 figs s9a and s9b thus it is probable that s iv played the similar role as source of eaq via photoionization of so3 2 eq 3 in sulfite uv and sulfite iodide uv phase ii li et al 2012 so s iv not only sustained the fast removal of cr vi but also produced eaq via photolysis 3 so3 2 hv so3 eaq 3 5 effect of iodide increasing iodide concentration from 0 to 0 2 mm promoted cr vi removal from about 22 to about 99 within 30 min in sulfite iodide uv fig 4 a possibly owing to enhanced generation of eaq by charge transfer to solvent ctts excitation of iodide eq 4 fennell et al 2022 liu et al 2022 sauer et al 2004 yu et al 2018 furthermore the cr vi removal kinetics were linearly enhanced by iodide with a slope of about 1 58 10 2 min 1 fig 4b comparing the linear relationship in fig 3b slope of 3 93 10 4 min 1 and fig 4b slope of 1 58 10 2 min 1 iodide showed much higher concentration normalized enhancement about 40 times on cr vi removal than s iv the greater contribution of iodide can be explained by its stronger uv absorption 220 m 1 cm 1 vs 18 14 m 1 cm 1 and higher quantum yield of eaq at 253 7 nm 0 29 mol e 1 vs 0 116 mol e 1 yu et al 2018 hence iodide also played a critical role in cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv 4 i hv i ctts i eaq 3 6 effect of water chemistry 3 6 1 dissolved oxygen the ubiquitous oxygen usually shows great inhibitory effects by competing for reactive species in many reduction processes e g zerovalent metals ki uv and γ radiation fennell et al 2022 garcia et al 2021 park et al 2009 yang et al 2020 yeo et al 2012 in sulfite iodide uv dissolved oxygen 8 mg l 1 only inhibited cr vi removal by about 20 fig 5 a showing the attractive advantages of this process under uv irradiation s iv consumes oxygen rapidly via chain reactions via eqs s4 s12 with so3 so4 and so5 as the chain carriers and the apparent quantum yield of s iv depletion is even higher than 100 mol e 1 fischer and warneck 1996 furthermore iodide also catalyzes the photooxidation of s iv with i and i2 as the main chain carriers kerezsi et al 2007 in fact dissolved oxygen was depleted very fast 0 5 min even in the absence of iodide under the similar conditions li et al 2012 as a consequence dissolved oxygen was exhausted much faster in sulfite iodide uv assuming stoichiometric consumption of dissolved oxygen by s iv at 2 1 the residual s iv should be about 0 5 mm s iv 0 1 0 mm the removal kinetics of cr vi in the presence of dissolved oxygen agreed well with the case of 0 5 mm sulfite fig 5a so the slight influence of dissolved oxygen was probably attributed to its fast depletion in this process 3 6 2 carbonate bicarbonate as shown in fig 5a 1 mm carbonate bicarbonate slightly retarded cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv the reactivity of carbonate bicarbonate with eaq 1 106 m 1 s 1 is low buxton et al 1988 li et al 2014 so the slight inhibition on cr vi removal by carbonate bicarbonate is possibly caused by the formation of complex carbonates of cr iii which attenuate uv fluence 3 6 3 natural organic matter the effect of natural organic matter nom on cr vi removal was examined by using humic acid ha as the representative and ha 2 mg l 1 also slightly inhibited cr vi removal by about 12 in the process fig 5a considering the stronger uv absorption of ha 48 25 g 1 cm 1 at 254 nm ha was more likely to act as uv light filter to attenuate uv fluence li et al 2014 further analysis on the uv fluence based kinetics of cr vi removal suggests that ha 2 mg l 1 accelerated cr vi removal by about 21 in the process fig s10 as ha is a heterogeneous mixture of redox active macromolecules the functional groups e g quinone like moieties may participate in reduction of cr vi or transient species e g cr v and cr iv bell et al 2022 also the cr complexes with ha may undergo photolysis to enhance cr vi reduction in the process so ha played a multifaceted role during cr vi removal in the process 3 6 4 real surface water the removal of cr vi from real surface water was investigated in sulfite iodide uv and almost complete removal of cr vi cr vi 0 100 μm was obtained within 50 min fig 5b especially only 5 μm iodide and 0 1 mm sulfite were required to remove low concentration of cr vi cr vi 0 5 μm to less than 0 05 mg l 1 compared with results in fig 1a cr vi removal was only retarded by about 4 in the surface water although the co existing carbonate and nom slightly influence cr vi removal by attenuating uv fluence as discussed above the presence of electron scavengers e g nitrate may inhibit cr vi removal through competing for eaq considerably in the process li et al 2014 3 7 roles of major reactive species although the role of eaq in reductive dehalogenation has been established in sulfite iodide uv fennell et al 2022 liu et al 2022 yu et al 2018 the contributions of other reactive species table s2 to cr vi removal are still unclear hence the roles of major reactive species in cr vi removal were explored in sulfite iodide uv 3 7 1 eaq because no2 is a good scavenger for both eaq 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 eq s13 and h 7 1 108 m 1 s 1 eq s14 but no3 only for eaq 9 7 1010 m 1 s 1 eq s15 1 4 106 m 1 s 1 with h eq s16 buxton et al 1988 the different inhibitory effects of no3 and no2 can indicate the role of eaq and h in the process using the methods reported in our previous studies li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 no3 and no2 were selected as quenchers to investigate the role of eaq and h in cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv both 10 mm no2 and 10 mm no3 almost completely inhibited cr vi removal in the process fig s11a thus eaq may be responsible for cr vi removal in the process because of rather low reactivity of no3 with other species e g h i and so3 li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 the almost complete inhibition of cr vi removal by no3 also excludes the involvement of those species in cr vi removal in the process in order to verify the role of eaq in the process competition kinetics analysis was further performed text s2 as mcaa reacts fast with eaq 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 eq s17 but very slowly with h 3 6 106 m 1 s 1 eq s18 it can serve as the eaq probe buxton et al 1988 kerzig et al 2019 naumann et al 2018 increasing mcaa concentration from 0 05 mm to 1 0 mm slowed down cr vi removal obviously fig s11b assuming eaq is the dominant species the removal kinetics of cr vi are relevant to concentration of competing agents no2 and mcaa here the ratio r 0 r between the removal rate of cr vi in the absence and presence of competing agents no2 and mcaa should linearly depend on no2 0 cr vi 0 or mcaa 0 cr vi 0 and the slope equals to the ratio of their corresponding second order rate constants with eaq i e 0 228 and 0 0556 in the case of no2 and mcaa respectively text s2 the slope value of about 0 226 agrees well with the theoretical one of 0 228 in the presence of no2 fig 6 a and that of about 0 0724 is also consistent with the predicted one of 0 0556 in the presence of mcaa fig 6b so those results strongly support the dominant role of eaq in cr vi removal in the process in theory the reduction of cr vi to cr iii needs transfer of three electrons eqs 5 8 buxton and djouider 1996 buxton et al 1988 therefore all the above evidence only supports that eaq accounts for the reduction of cr vi to cr v eq 5 in the process 5 cro4 2 eaq cr v k 3 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 6 cr v cr v cr iv cr vi k 4 3 4 108 m 1 s 1 7 cr v cr iv cr iii cr vi k 5 3 4 108 m 1 s 1 8 d c r v i d t 1 3 c r v i e a q 3 7 2 so3 under the conditions in fig 1a generation rate r e of eaq was estimated to be about 4 67 μm min 1 text s3 but it was much lower than that 7 17 μm min 1 calculated by eq 8 required for cr vi removal so there must be other species involved in removal of cr vi in the process the sulfur centered radical so3 is also simultaneously generated and accumulated via photoionization of so3 2 and reduction of reactive iodine species ris by s iv in sulfite iodide uv eqs s19 s44 yu et al 2018 it usually acts as a mild oxidant or reductant e 0 so3 so3 2 0 73 vnhe e 0 so4 2 so3 2 47 vnhe das et al 1999 wardman 1989 the role of so3 in reduction of cr vi via eq 9 is excluded by the complete inhibition of cr vi removal by no2 and no3 fig s11a as so3 cannot be effectively quenched by no3 or no2 dong et al 2020 li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 during the reduction of cr vi to cr iii e g eqs 5 and 7 reactive cr v and cr iv species e 0 cr v cr iii 1 75 vnhe e 0 cr iv cr iii 1 33 vnhe are generated bose et al 1986 zhang et al 2022 it was reported that so3 reacted much faster with cr v eq 10 and cr iv eq 11 than with cr vi eq 9 at acidic phs dong et al 2020 so it is rational to speculate that so3 also makes contributions to cr vi removal via reduction of cr v and cr iv eqs 10 and 11 at alkaline phs it is noted that the reactions of s iv with cr v or cr iv are not significant due to the rather low rate constants eqs 12 and 13 bose et al 1986 dong et al 2020 9 cro4 2 so3 cr v so4 2 k 6 8 3 106 m 1 s 1 10 cr v so3 cr iv so4 2 k 7 5 108 m 1 s 1 this study 11 cr iv so3 cr iii so4 2 k 8 5 108 m 1 s 1 this study 12 cr v so3 2 cr iv so3 k 9 0 033 m 1 s 1 13 cr iv so3 2 cr iii so3 k 10 4 1 m 1 s 1 in order to reveal the role of so3 in the process products during the removal of cr vi were identified fig 7 a sulfate so4 2 and dithionate s2o6 2 were generated simultaneously along with s iv decomposition the good mass balance for sulfur indicates that all the sulfur containing intermediates were all determined and quantified furthermore good electron balance supports that cr iii so4 2 and s2o6 2 were the final products fig s12 when so3 participates in the parallel reactions eqs 14a and 14b s2o6 2 and so4 2 are generated stoichiometrically with a molar ratio of about 0 61 1 under alkaline conditions fischer and warneck 1996 ichino and fessenden 2007 however the formation ratio between of s2o6 2 and so4 2 was about 0 28 1 fig 7b deviating considerably from the theoretical value so the formation of s2o6 2 was probably inhibited and or that of so4 2 was enhanced as s2o6 2 is formed via recombination of so3 eq 14a there must be other pathways to generate so4 2 for example via oxygen transfer of s iv and 1e oxidation of so3 to produce so4 2 reduction of cr vi by s iv usually follows single electron transfer bose et al 1986 dong et al 2020 hence much higher production of so4 2 than that from eq 14b fig 7b strongly supports the important role of so3 in cr vi reduction and simultaneous production of so4 2 possibly via eqs 10 and 11 14a so3 so3 s2o6 2 k 11 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 k 11a k 11b 0 61 14b so3 so3 h2o so3 2 so4 2 2h k 11b it is stressed that so3 was not involved significantly in reaction with cr vi but instead it participated in the reduction of cr v and cr iv according to the difference between electron acceptance by cr vi and eaq generation in the process as mentioned above 7 17 μm min 1 vs 4 67 μm min 1 text s3 the contribution of so3 to cr vi removal was estimated to be about 35 3 8 mechanism and pathways of cr vi removal product analysis shows that so3 2 decomposed with simultaneous generation of s2o6 2 and so4 2 during cr vi removal fig 7a good mass balances for sulfur fig 7a and for iodine fig s13 suggest that all the products were identified and quantified good electron balance indicates cr iii was the final product of cr vi reduction in the process fig s12 when s iv was exhausted cr vi removal almost stopped agreeing with the essential role of s iv in the process observed in fig 3a based on the product formation and roles of reactive species the mechanism of cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv is thus proposed in fig 8 as discussed above eaq is produced from the photoionization of so3 2 eq 3 and ctts excitation of i eq 4 and initiates the reduction of cr vi to cr v eq 5 subsequently disproportionation reactions of cr v generate cr vi and cr iv which is further converted to cr iii eqs 6 and 7 buxton and djouider 1996 meanwhile the simultaneously generated so3 via photoionization of so3 2 eq 3 and reduction of ris by s iv eqs s19 s44 is also involved in single electron reduction of cr v and cr iv eqs 10 and 11 iodide acts as a catalyst for continuous and stable generation of eaq and so3 while so3 2 plays multiple roles not only by sustaining cycle of i eqs s19 s44 but also by producing eaq and so3 eq 3 yu et al 2018 when s iv is indispensable for cr vi removal it is converted to so4 2 and s2o6 2 eqs 10 11 14a and 14b fig 7a hence the synergy between s iv and iodide is attributed to the catalytic cycle of i and the enhanced production of eaq and so3 3 9 kinetic modeling taking into account the main reactions in the process eqs 1 15 and table s2 the removal kinetics of cr vi were modeled mathematically with the assistance of kintecus version 2021 ianni 2003 li et al 2014 the importance of reactions of so3 with cr v and cr iv eqs 10 and 11 is also supported by the analysis of partial correlation coefficient text s4 and sensitivity analysis fig s14 text s5 and the rate constants of 5 108 m 1 s 1 are thus estimated for the both 15 cro4 2 h cro4 3 h k 12 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 the developed model well simulated cr vi removal in the process with an rmse of 0 022 and r 2 of 0 996 fig 1a text s6 when the initial cr vi concentration was low 5 μm the model overestimated the results with an rmse of 0 200 fig 1b possibly due to the increased scavenging of eaq by competition reactions involving so3 2 s2o6 2 etc buxton et al 1988 fischer and warneck 1996 the model also well predicted the dependence of cr vi removal rate on the concentrations of s iv rmse 0 297 μm min 1 r 2 0 949 fig 3b and iodide rmse 0 122 μm min 1 r 2 0 980 fig 4b in the process the slight underestimation of the removal rate by the model at 10 mm sulfite fig 3b may be due to the enhancement of rate constants between ions with the same sign e g eqs 5 10 and 11 by increasing ionic strength buxton et al 1988 furthermore the model also well described the relationship between formation of s2o6 2 and so4 2 fig 7b strongly supporting the significant involvement of so3 in the reduction of cr v and cr iv eqs 10 and 11 in addition the model well simulated the simultaneous cr vi removal r 2 0 941 s iv decomposition r 2 0 995 and formation of s2o6 2 r 2 0 998 and so4 2 r 2 0 977 fig 7a good prediction for consumption of s iv for cr vi removal was also obtained by the model δ s iv δ cr vi 2 06 1 figs s15 and s16 it is noted that the model developed here was applied at alkaline conditions as a consequence the mechanism of cr vi removal at alkaline phs in the process was well verified considering the water matrix components such as electron scavengers e g nitrate table s2 and uv absorbers e g nom the model still satisfactorily simulated the cr vi removal in real surface water by sulfite iodide uv rmse 10 fig 5b the slight underprediction of the model for cr vi removal may be caused by the contributions of nom to cr vi removal fig s10 as discussed above through reducing cr species e g cr v and cr iv or by photolysis of cr nom complexes bell et al 2022 the involvement of nom in reduction of cr vi was currently not considered in the model due to the variable and complex nature of nom bell et al 2022 li et al 2014 there is still some uncertainty in molar absorption coefficients of so3 2 and i and the quantum yields of eaq eqs 3 and 4 fennell et al 2022 and the model will be refined in future using the model the contributions of reactive species eaq and so3 to cr vi removal were thus quantified figs s17 s19 almost all the generated eaq was involved in the cr vi reduction via eq 5 in pure water but about one fourth of eaq was captured by the electron scavengers e g nitrate in surface water fig s18 in comparison so3 accounted for more than one fourth of cr iv removal figs s17a and s17b but its relative contribution increased slightly in surface water figs s17b and s19 as a result electron scavengers were the major factors influencing removal efficiency of cr vi in the process 3 10 implications the efficient removal of cr vi from water under alkaline conditions is still a challenge due to its ph dependent reactivity electrostatic interaction with surface and formation of passivation layer e g cr oh 3 maitlo et al 2019 pincus et al 2020 stern et al 2021 thus the new sulfite iodide uv offered a promising choice for one step removal of cr vi from surface water fig 5b and industrial wastewater fig s20 the efficiency of cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv about 1 19 kwh m 3 in surface water and about 2 15 kwh m 3 in industrial wastewater text s7 was much higher than that in photocatalysis photoelectrocatalysis electrochemical methods photochemical treatment e g co2 and sulfite uv chen and liu 2020 maitlo et al 2019 miklos et al 2018 furthermore sulfite iodide uv only consumed a relatively low concentration of sulfite and iodide fig 5b and fig s20 but without the requirement of additional chemicals e g h2so4 and ca oh 2 for ph adjustment thus generating much less sludge in addition the performance of sulfite iodide uv was not much influenced by dissolved oxygen fig 5a so the process may be applied in a wide range of water matrices e g surface water fig 5b and industrial wastewater fig s20 sulfite iodide uv could make full of sulfite fig 7a which was a common industrial by product for contaminant removal e g cr vi with the strategy of waste control by waste zhao et al 2022 the specific sulfite demand in sulfite iodide uv s iv 0 cr vi 0 of 2 1 1 figs s15 and s16 was reduced by more than 90 compared with sulfite uv fig s9 thus the cost of sulfite and the residual sulfite should not be a problem fennell et al 2022 hofman caris et al 2021 wacławek et al 2022 the cost of iodide should not be a major barrier for applications of sulfite iodide uv cui et al 2020 fennell et al 2022 liu et al 2022 iodide acted as catalyst to produce eaq so iodide concentration could be adjusted flexibly by controlling uv fluence in fact 5 μm iodide could considerably enhance the cr vi removal fig 5b and fig s6 in particular iodide from aquatic environment or released during degradation of coexisting iodinated compounds e g iodinated x ray contrast media may satisfy cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv cao et al 2021 richardson et al 2008 the potential risks of iodinated byproducts are of concern in the presence of oxidants richardson et al 2008 the problems about iodide may be mitigated through separating i by exchange resins or nanocomposites transforming i to nontoxic io3 or io4 or immobilizing i on inert carriers or catalysts liu et al 2022 more studies are required to optimize this process systematically and to evaluate the potential risks comprehensively prior to any suggestion on possible application of this process in water treatment and environmental remediation 4 conclusions this study provides an insight into kinetics mechanism and modeling of cr vi removal under alkaline conditions in sulfite iodide uv the following conclusions can be drawn 1 at alkaline phs cr vi removal followed pseudo zero order kinetics in the process and were accelerated by sulfite and iodide with a significant synergy 2 the cr vi removal were promoted by decreasing ph and increasing temperature with e a of about 40 7 kj mol 1 and were slightly influenced by dissolved oxygen carbonate and nom the process was still effective for cr vi removal in real surface water and industrial wastewater 3 both eaq and so3 accounted for cr vi removal making contributions of about 75 and 25 respectively when eaq mainly reacted with cr vi so3 participated in reduction of cr v and cr iv intermediates 4 pathways of cr vi removal were proposed reduction of cr vi proceeded via one electron transfer processes with cr iii as the final product and s iv was converted to s2o6 2 and so4 2 the specific s iv demand s iv 0 cr vi 0 for cr vi removal was about 2 1 1 5 a kinetic model was developed to predict cr vi removal the model not only well interpreted the roles of s iv and iodide and the synergy but also quantified the contributions of major reactive species in the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15684,efficient removal of toxic hexavalent chromium cr vi under alkaline conditions is still a challenge due to the relatively low reactivity of cro4 2 this study proposed a new sulfite iodide uv process to remove cr vi the removal of cr vi followed pseudo zero order kinetics at alkaline phs and was enhanced by sulfite and iodide with synergy compared with sulfite uv iodide in sulfite iodide uv showed about 40 times higher concentration normalized enhancement for cr vi removal and reduced the requirement of sulfite s iv 0 cr vi 0 of about 2 1 1 by more than 90 the cr vi removal was accelerated by decreasing ph and by increasing temperature and was slightly influenced by dissolved oxygen carbonate and humic acid the process was still effective in real surface water and industrial wastewater mechanism and pathways of cr vi removal were revealed by quenching experiments competition kinetic analysis product identification and quantification and mass and electron balance both eaq and so3 were responsible for cr vi removal making contributions of about 75 and 25 respectively when eaq mainly reacted with cr vi so3 participated in reduction of cr v and cr iv intermediates with cr iii s2o6 2 and so4 2 as the final products a model was developed to predict removal kinetics of cr vi and well interpreted the roles of s iv and iodide in the process this study sheds light on mechanism of cr vi removal at alkaline phs by kinetic modeling and thus advances the applicability of this promising process for water decontamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract

inevitable release of toxic cr into environment due to its wide applications in industry poses a great threat to ecology and public health wise et al 2022 the pollution of cr in aquatic environment has raised a great concern worldwide and many countries and regions have established stringent regulations for cr in drinking water e g 0 05 mg l 1 cr by who and discharge limits in wastewater bolisetty et al 2019 vaiopoulou and gikas 2020 the removal of cr has been studied extensively for decades and many methods have been developed such as coprecipitation chemical reduction electrocoagulation bioremediation electrocatalysis photoelectrocatalysis membrane filtration and adsorption bashir et al 2022 bolisetty et al 2019 pincus et al 2020 while cr is presently mostly in forms of trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi chromium the concerns with cr are primarily related to cr vi owing to its much higher mobility bioaccumulation and toxicity vaiopoulou and gikas 2020 as cr iii can be easily precipitated under alkaline conditions reduction of cr vi to cr iii is the pivotal step for efficient removal of cr vi from water and wastewater under acidic conditions the oxidizing activity of cr vi is strong e g e 0 hcro4 cr3 1 35 vnhe stern et al 2021 so the reduction of cr vi can be more easily achieved although the two step process cr vi reduction and cr iii precipitation is widely applied additional chemicals e g sulfuric acid lime and alkali are usually required to adjust ph for efficient reduction of cr vi at acidic phs and the following precipitation of cr iii as hydroxides kalidhasan et al 2016 stern et al 2021 thus simultaneous reduction of cr vi and precipitation of cr iii are highly desired xie et al 2017 however it is currently still a big challenge due to the much lower reactivity of cro4 2 weak electrostatic interaction with surface and formation of passivation layer e g cr oh 3 under alkaline conditions maitlo et al 2019 pincus et al 2020 stern et al 2021 furthermore cheap active and stable materials e g catalysts for practical removal of cr vi are still lacking akbashev 2022 pincus et al 2020 stern et al 2021 hydrated electron

perfluorocarboxylates cui et al 2020 fennell et al 2022 li et al 2019 yang et al 2020 because of the relatively high efficiency innocuousness simplicity and potential feasibility of sulfite uv this process was considered as a promising method to produce eaq for decontamination cui et al 2020 fennell et al 2022 yang et al 2020 one step removal of cr vi under alkaline conditions could be achieved in sulfite uv xie et al 2017 however this process was still limited by low efficiency of eaq production and high demand of chemicals fennell et al 2022 li et al 2014 furthermore the mechanism and pathways of cr vi removal in particular the roles of reactive species e g eaq h and so3 and the conversion of intermediate cr species e g cr v and cr iv in the process are still not clear and kinetic modeling is also highly desirable fennell et al 2022 previous study showed that sulfite iodide uv process exhibited much higher efficiency in reductive dechlorination of monochloroacetic acid mcaa than the sulfite uv process yu et al 2018 by introducing a small amount several μm of iodide the generation of eaq and utilization of sulfite could be enhanced considerably and the influence of ph was also alleviated to a great extent hence it is expected that sulfite iodide uv will achieve much higher removal efficiency of cr vi under alkaline conditions to the best of our knowledge there has been no study on the mechanism and modeling of cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the removal of cr vi under alkaline conditions in sulfite iodide uv specifically focusing on 1 removal kinetics 2 influence of typical factors ph temperature s iv iodide dissolved oxygen and real water matrix 3 mechanism and 4 kinetic modeling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were at least of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification text s1 in supporting information deionized water was used to prepare solutions real surface water and industrial wastewater samples were collected from the qiantang river hangzhou section china and an industrial wastewater treatment plant in xianju zhejiang china respectively and were filtered by cellulose membrane 0 45 μm prior to experiments the characteristics of the water samples were summarized in table s1 2 2 experimental procedure the irradiation experiments were performed in a cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor 0 8 l with a uv lamp 10 w 253 7 nm gph212t5l heraeus noblelight vertically positioned in the center of the reactor the uv photon flux i 0 253 7 nm amount basis was about 2 43 μeinstein s 1 by ki kio3 method fig s1 rahn 1997 and the spatial average or effective path length of light l was about 4 08 cm according to photolysis kinetics of dilute h2o2 solution fig s2 more details were reported in our previous studies li et al 2014 2012 yu et al 2018 solution temperature was controlled by a thermostatic water recirculation system and solution ph was adjusted using borate 10 mm ph 8 11 and phosphate buffer 5 mm ph 5 8 the uv lamp was preheated at least 15 min prior to photochemical experiments and solutions were deoxygenated by purging n2 99 999 1 l min 1 for more than 15 min unless otherwise noted all experiments were repeated at least two times 2 3 analytical methods solution ph was measured with a ph meter pb 10 sartorius uv vis absorption of samples was analyzed on uv vis spectrophotometer t6 persee analytics the concentration of cr vi was determined by the absorption at 372 nm or by diphenylcarbazide complexation method at 540 nm for low centration 2 μm of cr vi loyaux lawniczak et al 2001 the concentrations of h2o2 were quantified by the i3 method at 352 nm klassen et al 1994 inorganic anions no3 cl i s2o6 2 so3 2 and so4 2 were analyzed on an ion chromatograph ics 90 dionex as described previously li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 the cod of wastewater was determined on a cod analyzer 5b 3f lian hua tech co ltd china and the total nitrogen tn was determined spectrophotometrically via alkaline potassium persulfate digestion method 2 4 kinetic modeling based on the steady state assumption the concentrations of transient species could be calculated and thus the kinetics of the corresponding reactions could be simply modeled using the chemical modeling software package kintecus version 2021 ianni 2003 a model involving all the reactions eqs 1 15 and reactions in table s2 was developed to simulate the kinetics of cr vi removal in the system most of the second order rate constants for the reactions were available from literature and sensitivity analysis and relative significance were conducted to estimate the values if not reported the initial conditions for simulation were in consistence with those in experiments the prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated using statistical parameters such as the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse more details in supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal kinetics of cr vi in sulfite iodide uv at alkaline ph cro4 2 is the dominant species of cr vi pk a1 0 75 and pk a2 6 45 fig s3 negligible removal of cr vi by s iv was observed within 30 min at alkaline phs via eq 1 fig s4 due to the relatively low oxidizing activity of cro4 2 e 0 cro4 2 cr oh 3 0 13 vnhe stern et al 2021 xie et al 2017 thus the fast reduction of cro4 2 is the critical step for cr vi removal under alkaline conditions 1 cro4 2 so3 2 cr v so3 k 1 0 03 m 1 s 1 this study fig 1 a shows removal of cr vi in three processes including iodide uv sulfite uv and sulfite iodide uv compared with negligible removal of cr vi by uv direct photolysis and iodide uv xie et al 2017 yeo et al 2012 about 32 of cr vi cr vi 0 100 μm was removed in sulfite uv 6 9 j cm 2 and about 95 removal was obtained in sulfite iodide uv 8 3 j cm 2 within 50 min at ph 9 2 the removal of cr vi in sulfite uv and sulfite iodide uv both followed pseudo zero rate kinetics fig 1a and fig s5a the cr vi removal rate r μm min 1 in sulfite iodide uv 2 39 μm min 1 was about 3 times higher than the sum of that in sulfite uv 0 78 μm min 1 and iodide uv 0 02 μm min 1 indicating a significant synergistic effect of sulfite and iodide in the process one tailed student s t test p 0 05 it seems that cr vi also showed significant uv light screening effect ε 254nm of 2622 m 1 cm 1 at ph 9 2 decreasing initial cr vi concentration from 200 μm to 5 μm not only enhanced the removal of cr vi from about 1 to about 60 within 1 min but also increased the removal rate from about 1 70 μm min 1 to about 2 45 μm min 1 fig s5b furthermore complete removal of the initial 1 μm cr vi could be readily achieved with 100 μm sulfite and 5 μm iodide within 8 min fig s6 thus the process showed good performance for cr vi removal at alkaline phs 3 2 effect of ph in sulfite iodide uv the removal ratio of cr vi was promoted from about 29 to about 100 within 15 min by decreasing ph from 10 1 to 7 0 fig s7 and a sudden jump of cr vi removal rate from about 4 2 μm min 1 at ph 7 7 to about 8 1 μm min 1 at ph 7 0 occurred fig 2 a the similar influence of ph on cr vi removal was also observed in sulfite uv xie et al 2017 increasing ph favors the generation of eaq and helps mitigate scavenging of species by competing reactions eqs s1 s3 li et al 2014 however the negative ph dependency of cr vi removal kinetics was observed this may be ascribed to the change of species distribution of cr vi decreasing ph promotes conversion of cro4 2 to hcro4 fig s3 which has much higher oxidizing activity stern et al 2021 and thus hso3 and other mild reactive species e g so3 are possibly involved in reaction with hcro4 instead of cro4 2 eq 2 dong et al 2020 also hcro4 has weaker uv absorption than cro4 2 2086 m 1 cm 1 vs 2622 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm and exhibits a less uv light screening effect so decreasing ph promoted removal of cr vi in sulfite iodide uv 2 hcro4 hso3 cr v so3 h k 2 15 68 m 1 s 1 3 3 effect of temperature increasing temperature accelerated cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv fig s8a and the apparent activation e a was estimated to be about 40 7 kj mol 1 using arrhenius equation fig s8b the e a in sulfite iodide uv was higher than that in sulfite uv 31 7 kj mol 1 li et al 2014 interestingly cr vi removal rate r exhibited a better linear dependence on temperature fig 2b generally temperature influences effective quantum yields of photolysis processes by not only governing the viscosity of water but also determining the rate constants of the photofragments recombination reactions herrmann 2007 sauer et al 2004 assuming the complete capture of reactive species by cr vi in the process which is supported by the pseudo zero order kinetics of cr iv removal r can indicate the generation rate of reactive species thus the linear relationship in fig 2b also suggests that effective quantum yields of reactive species in sulfite iodide uv were linearly dependent upon temperature actually t dependences of effective quantum yields do not have to correspond to the arrhenius form herrmann 2007 and the similar linear t dependence of quantum yields was also observed in the photolysis of iodide 3 45 10 3 k 1 sulfite 3 68 10 3 k 1 and oh 3 10 3 k 1 crowell et al 2004 li et al 2014 rahn 1997 3 4 effect of s iv as shown in fig 3 a cr vi removal was enhanced from 0 to almost 100 within 20 min by increasing s iv concentration so2 h2o hso3 and so3 2 fig s3 from 0 to 10 mm the final removal ratio of cr vi was determined by initial s iv concentration and cr vi cr vi 0 100 μm could not be completely removed when s iv concentration was lower than 200 μm thus s iv may play an important role in sustaining the continuous removal of cr vi in sulfite iodide uv the relationship between cr vi removal kinetics and s iv concentration was further analyzed fig 3b about 25 μm accelerated the cr vi removal rate r sharply from about 0 μm min 1 to 1 66 μm min 1 phase i while further increasing s iv concentration to 10 mm only resulted in much weaker enhancement on the rate slope of 3 93 10 4 min 1 phase ii actually the similar two phase relationship was also observed in dechlorination of mcaa in the process yu et al 2018 the linear dependence of r on s iv concentration phase ii fig 3b was very close to that in sulfite uv slope of 4 61 10 4 min 1 figs s9a and s9b thus it is probable that s iv played the similar role as source of eaq via photoionization of so3 2 eq 3 in sulfite uv and sulfite iodide uv phase ii li et al 2012 so s iv not only sustained the fast removal of cr vi but also produced eaq via photolysis 3 so3 2 hv so3 eaq 3 5 effect of iodide increasing iodide concentration from 0 to 0 2 mm promoted cr vi removal from about 22 to about 99 within 30 min in sulfite iodide uv fig 4 a possibly owing to enhanced generation of eaq by charge transfer to solvent ctts excitation of iodide eq 4 fennell et al 2022 liu et al 2022 sauer et al 2004 yu et al 2018 furthermore the cr vi removal kinetics were linearly enhanced by iodide with a slope of about 1 58 10 2 min 1 fig 4b comparing the linear relationship in fig 3b slope of 3 93 10 4 min 1 and fig 4b slope of 1 58 10 2 min 1 iodide showed much higher concentration normalized enhancement about 40 times on cr vi removal than s iv the greater contribution of iodide can be explained by its stronger uv absorption 220 m 1 cm 1 vs 18 14 m 1 cm 1 and higher quantum yield of eaq at 253 7 nm 0 29 mol e 1 vs 0 116 mol e 1 yu et al 2018 hence iodide also played a critical role in cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv 4 i hv i ctts i eaq 3 6 effect of water chemistry 3 6 1 dissolved oxygen the ubiquitous oxygen usually shows great inhibitory effects by competing for reactive species in many reduction processes e g zerovalent metals ki uv and γ radiation fennell et al 2022 garcia et al 2021 park et al 2009 yang et al 2020 yeo et al 2012 in sulfite iodide uv dissolved oxygen 8 mg l 1 only inhibited cr vi removal by about 20 fig 5 a showing the attractive advantages of this process under uv irradiation s iv consumes oxygen rapidly via chain reactions via eqs s4 s12 with so3 so4 and so5 as the chain carriers and the apparent quantum yield of s iv depletion is even higher than 100 mol e 1 fischer and warneck 1996 furthermore iodide also catalyzes the photooxidation of s iv with i and i2 as the main chain carriers kerezsi et al 2007 in fact dissolved oxygen was depleted very fast 0 5 min even in the absence of iodide under the similar conditions li et al 2012 as a consequence dissolved oxygen was exhausted much faster in sulfite iodide uv assuming stoichiometric consumption of dissolved oxygen by s iv at 2 1 the residual s iv should be about 0 5 mm s iv 0 1 0 mm the removal kinetics of cr vi in the presence of dissolved oxygen agreed well with the case of 0 5 mm sulfite fig 5a so the slight influence of dissolved oxygen was probably attributed to its fast depletion in this process 3 6 2 carbonate bicarbonate as shown in fig 5a 1 mm carbonate bicarbonate slightly retarded cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv the reactivity of carbonate bicarbonate with eaq 1 106 m 1 s 1 is low buxton et al 1988 li et al 2014 so the slight inhibition on cr vi removal by carbonate bicarbonate is possibly caused by the formation of complex carbonates of cr iii which attenuate uv fluence 3 6 3 natural organic matter the effect of natural organic matter nom on cr vi removal was examined by using humic acid ha as the representative and ha 2 mg l 1 also slightly inhibited cr vi removal by about 12 in the process fig 5a considering the stronger uv absorption of ha 48 25 g 1 cm 1 at 254 nm ha was more likely to act as uv light filter to attenuate uv fluence li et al 2014 further analysis on the uv fluence based kinetics of cr vi removal suggests that ha 2 mg l 1 accelerated cr vi removal by about 21 in the process fig s10 as ha is a heterogeneous mixture of redox active macromolecules the functional groups e g quinone like moieties may participate in reduction of cr vi or transient species e g cr v and cr iv bell et al 2022 also the cr complexes with ha may undergo photolysis to enhance cr vi reduction in the process so ha played a multifaceted role during cr vi removal in the process 3 6 4 real surface water the removal of cr vi from real surface water was investigated in sulfite iodide uv and almost complete removal of cr vi cr vi 0 100 μm was obtained within 50 min fig 5b especially only 5 μm iodide and 0 1 mm sulfite were required to remove low concentration of cr vi cr vi 0 5 μm to less than 0 05 mg l 1 compared with results in fig 1a cr vi removal was only retarded by about 4 in the surface water although the co existing carbonate and nom slightly influence cr vi removal by attenuating uv fluence as discussed above the presence of electron scavengers e g nitrate may inhibit cr vi removal through competing for eaq considerably in the process li et al 2014 3 7 roles of major reactive species although the role of eaq in reductive dehalogenation has been established in sulfite iodide uv fennell et al 2022 liu et al 2022 yu et al 2018 the contributions of other reactive species table s2 to cr vi removal are still unclear hence the roles of major reactive species in cr vi removal were explored in sulfite iodide uv 3 7 1 eaq because no2 is a good scavenger for both eaq 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 eq s13 and h 7 1 108 m 1 s 1 eq s14 but no3 only for eaq 9 7 1010 m 1 s 1 eq s15 1 4 106 m 1 s 1 with h eq s16 buxton et al 1988 the different inhibitory effects of no3 and no2 can indicate the role of eaq and h in the process using the methods reported in our previous studies li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 no3 and no2 were selected as quenchers to investigate the role of eaq and h in cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv both 10 mm no2 and 10 mm no3 almost completely inhibited cr vi removal in the process fig s11a thus eaq may be responsible for cr vi removal in the process because of rather low reactivity of no3 with other species e g h i and so3 li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 the almost complete inhibition of cr vi removal by no3 also excludes the involvement of those species in cr vi removal in the process in order to verify the role of eaq in the process competition kinetics analysis was further performed text s2 as mcaa reacts fast with eaq 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 eq s17 but very slowly with h 3 6 106 m 1 s 1 eq s18 it can serve as the eaq probe buxton et al 1988 kerzig et al 2019 naumann et al 2018 increasing mcaa concentration from 0 05 mm to 1 0 mm slowed down cr vi removal obviously fig s11b assuming eaq is the dominant species the removal kinetics of cr vi are relevant to concentration of competing agents no2 and mcaa here the ratio r 0 r between the removal rate of cr vi in the absence and presence of competing agents no2 and mcaa should linearly depend on no2 0 cr vi 0 or mcaa 0 cr vi 0 and the slope equals to the ratio of their corresponding second order rate constants with eaq i e 0 228 and 0 0556 in the case of no2 and mcaa respectively text s2 the slope value of about 0 226 agrees well with the theoretical one of 0 228 in the presence of no2 fig 6 a and that of about 0 0724 is also consistent with the predicted one of 0 0556 in the presence of mcaa fig 6b so those results strongly support the dominant role of eaq in cr vi removal in the process in theory the reduction of cr vi to cr iii needs transfer of three electrons eqs 5 8 buxton and djouider 1996 buxton et al 1988 therefore all the above evidence only supports that eaq accounts for the reduction of cr vi to cr v eq 5 in the process 5 cro4 2 eaq cr v k 3 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 6 cr v cr v cr iv cr vi k 4 3 4 108 m 1 s 1 7 cr v cr iv cr iii cr vi k 5 3 4 108 m 1 s 1 8 d c r v i d t 1 3 c r v i e a q 3 7 2 so3 under the conditions in fig 1a generation rate r e of eaq was estimated to be about 4 67 μm min 1 text s3 but it was much lower than that 7 17 μm min 1 calculated by eq 8 required for cr vi removal so there must be other species involved in removal of cr vi in the process the sulfur centered radical so3 is also simultaneously generated and accumulated via photoionization of so3 2 and reduction of reactive iodine species ris by s iv in sulfite iodide uv eqs s19 s44 yu et al 2018 it usually acts as a mild oxidant or reductant e 0 so3 so3 2 0 73 vnhe e 0 so4 2 so3 2 47 vnhe das et al 1999 wardman 1989 the role of so3 in reduction of cr vi via eq 9 is excluded by the complete inhibition of cr vi removal by no2 and no3 fig s11a as so3 cannot be effectively quenched by no3 or no2 dong et al 2020 li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 during the reduction of cr vi to cr iii e g eqs 5 and 7 reactive cr v and cr iv species e 0 cr v cr iii 1 75 vnhe e 0 cr iv cr iii 1 33 vnhe are generated bose et al 1986 zhang et al 2022 it was reported that so3 reacted much faster with cr v eq 10 and cr iv eq 11 than with cr vi eq 9 at acidic phs dong et al 2020 so it is rational to speculate that so3 also makes contributions to cr vi removal via reduction of cr v and cr iv eqs 10 and 11 at alkaline phs it is noted that the reactions of s iv with cr v or cr iv are not significant due to the rather low rate constants eqs 12 and 13 bose et al 1986 dong et al 2020 9 cro4 2 so3 cr v so4 2 k 6 8 3 106 m 1 s 1 10 cr v so3 cr iv so4 2 k 7 5 108 m 1 s 1 this study 11 cr iv so3 cr iii so4 2 k 8 5 108 m 1 s 1 this study 12 cr v so3 2 cr iv so3 k 9 0 033 m 1 s 1 13 cr iv so3 2 cr iii so3 k 10 4 1 m 1 s 1 in order to reveal the role of so3 in the process products during the removal of cr vi were identified fig 7 a sulfate so4 2 and dithionate s2o6 2 were generated simultaneously along with s iv decomposition the good mass balance for sulfur indicates that all the sulfur containing intermediates were all determined and quantified furthermore good electron balance supports that cr iii so4 2 and s2o6 2 were the final products fig s12 when so3 participates in the parallel reactions eqs 14a and 14b s2o6 2 and so4 2 are generated stoichiometrically with a molar ratio of about 0 61 1 under alkaline conditions fischer and warneck 1996 ichino and fessenden 2007 however the formation ratio between of s2o6 2 and so4 2 was about 0 28 1 fig 7b deviating considerably from the theoretical value so the formation of s2o6 2 was probably inhibited and or that of so4 2 was enhanced as s2o6 2 is formed via recombination of so3 eq 14a there must be other pathways to generate so4 2 for example via oxygen transfer of s iv and 1e oxidation of so3 to produce so4 2 reduction of cr vi by s iv usually follows single electron transfer bose et al 1986 dong et al 2020 hence much higher production of so4 2 than that from eq 14b fig 7b strongly supports the important role of so3 in cr vi reduction and simultaneous production of so4 2 possibly via eqs 10 and 11 14a so3 so3 s2o6 2 k 11 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 k 11a k 11b 0 61 14b so3 so3 h2o so3 2 so4 2 2h k 11b it is stressed that so3 was not involved significantly in reaction with cr vi but instead it participated in the reduction of cr v and cr iv according to the difference between electron acceptance by cr vi and eaq generation in the process as mentioned above 7 17 μm min 1 vs 4 67 μm min 1 text s3 the contribution of so3 to cr vi removal was estimated to be about 35 3 8 mechanism and pathways of cr vi removal product analysis shows that so3 2 decomposed with simultaneous generation of s2o6 2 and so4 2 during cr vi removal fig 7a good mass balances for sulfur fig 7a and for iodine fig s13 suggest that all the products were identified and quantified good electron balance indicates cr iii was the final product of cr vi reduction in the process fig s12 when s iv was exhausted cr vi removal almost stopped agreeing with the essential role of s iv in the process observed in fig 3a based on the product formation and roles of reactive species the mechanism of cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv is thus proposed in fig 8 as discussed above eaq is produced from the photoionization of so3 2 eq 3 and ctts excitation of i eq 4 and initiates the reduction of cr vi to cr v eq 5 subsequently disproportionation reactions of cr v generate cr vi and cr iv which is further converted to cr iii eqs 6 and 7 buxton and djouider 1996 meanwhile the simultaneously generated so3 via photoionization of so3 2 eq 3 and reduction of ris by s iv eqs s19 s44 is also involved in single electron reduction of cr v and cr iv eqs 10 and 11 iodide acts as a catalyst for continuous and stable generation of eaq and so3 while so3 2 plays multiple roles not only by sustaining cycle of i eqs s19 s44 but also by producing eaq and so3 eq 3 yu et al 2018 when s iv is indispensable for cr vi removal it is converted to so4 2 and s2o6 2 eqs 10 11 14a and 14b fig 7a hence the synergy between s iv and iodide is attributed to the catalytic cycle of i and the enhanced production of eaq and so3 3 9 kinetic modeling taking into account the main reactions in the process eqs 1 15 and table s2 the removal kinetics of cr vi were modeled mathematically with the assistance of kintecus version 2021 ianni 2003 li et al 2014 the importance of reactions of so3 with cr v and cr iv eqs 10 and 11 is also supported by the analysis of partial correlation coefficient text s4 and sensitivity analysis fig s14 text s5 and the rate constants of 5 108 m 1 s 1 are thus estimated for the both 15 cro4 2 h cro4 3 h k 12 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 the developed model well simulated cr vi removal in the process with an rmse of 0 022 and r 2 of 0 996 fig 1a text s6 when the initial cr vi concentration was low 5 μm the model overestimated the results with an rmse of 0 200 fig 1b possibly due to the increased scavenging of eaq by competition reactions involving so3 2 s2o6 2 etc buxton et al 1988 fischer and warneck 1996 the model also well predicted the dependence of cr vi removal rate on the concentrations of s iv rmse 0 297 μm min 1 r 2 0 949 fig 3b and iodide rmse 0 122 μm min 1 r 2 0 980 fig 4b in the process the slight underestimation of the removal rate by the model at 10 mm sulfite fig 3b may be due to the enhancement of rate constants between ions with the same sign e g eqs 5 10 and 11 by increasing ionic strength buxton et al 1988 furthermore the model also well described the relationship between formation of s2o6 2 and so4 2 fig 7b strongly supporting the significant involvement of so3 in the reduction of cr v and cr iv eqs 10 and 11 in addition the model well simulated the simultaneous cr vi removal r 2 0 941 s iv decomposition r 2 0 995 and formation of s2o6 2 r 2 0 998 and so4 2 r 2 0 977 fig 7a good prediction for consumption of s iv for cr vi removal was also obtained by the model δ s iv δ cr vi 2 06 1 figs s15 and s16 it is noted that the model developed here was applied at alkaline conditions as a consequence the mechanism of cr vi removal at alkaline phs in the process was well verified considering the water matrix components such as electron scavengers e g nitrate table s2 and uv absorbers e g nom the model still satisfactorily simulated the cr vi removal in real surface water by sulfite iodide uv rmse 10 fig 5b the slight underprediction of the model for cr vi removal may be caused by the contributions of nom to cr vi removal fig s10 as discussed above through reducing cr species e g cr v and cr iv or by photolysis of cr nom complexes bell et al 2022 the involvement of nom in reduction of cr vi was currently not considered in the model due to the variable and complex nature of nom bell et al 2022 li et al 2014 there is still some uncertainty in molar absorption coefficients of so3 2 and i and the quantum yields of eaq eqs 3 and 4 fennell et al 2022 and the model will be refined in future using the model the contributions of reactive species eaq and so3 to cr vi removal were thus quantified figs s17 s19 almost all the generated eaq was involved in the cr vi reduction via eq 5 in pure water but about one fourth of eaq was captured by the electron scavengers e g nitrate in surface water fig s18 in comparison so3 accounted for more than one fourth of cr iv removal figs s17a and s17b but its relative contribution increased slightly in surface water figs s17b and s19 as a result electron scavengers were the major factors influencing removal efficiency of cr vi in the process 3 10 implications the efficient removal of cr vi from water under alkaline conditions is still a challenge due to its ph dependent reactivity electrostatic interaction with surface and formation of passivation layer e g cr oh 3 maitlo et al 2019 pincus et al 2020 stern et al 2021 thus the new sulfite iodide uv offered a promising choice for one step removal of cr vi from surface water fig 5b and industrial wastewater fig s20 the efficiency of cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv about 1 19 kwh m 3 in surface water and about 2 15 kwh m 3 in industrial wastewater text s7 was much higher than that in photocatalysis photoelectrocatalysis electrochemical methods photochemical treatment e g co2 and sulfite uv chen and liu 2020 maitlo et al 2019 miklos et al 2018 furthermore sulfite iodide uv only consumed a relatively low concentration of sulfite and iodide fig 5b and fig s20 but without the requirement of additional chemicals e g h2so4 and ca oh 2 for ph adjustment thus generating much less sludge in addition the performance of sulfite iodide uv was not much influenced by dissolved oxygen fig 5a so the process may be applied in a wide range of water matrices e g surface water fig 5b and industrial wastewater fig s20 sulfite iodide uv could make full of sulfite fig 7a which was a common industrial by product for contaminant removal e g cr vi with the strategy of waste control by waste zhao et al 2022 the specific sulfite demand in sulfite iodide uv s iv 0 cr vi 0 of 2 1 1 figs s15 and s16 was reduced by more than 90 compared with sulfite uv fig s9 thus the cost of sulfite and the residual sulfite should not be a problem fennell et al 2022 hofman caris et al 2021 wacławek et al 2022 the cost of iodide should not be a major barrier for applications of sulfite iodide uv cui et al 2020 fennell et al 2022 liu et al 2022 iodide acted as catalyst to produce eaq so iodide concentration could be adjusted flexibly by controlling uv fluence in fact 5 μm iodide could considerably enhance the cr vi removal fig 5b and fig s6 in particular iodide from aquatic environment or released during degradation of coexisting iodinated compounds e g iodinated x ray contrast media may satisfy cr vi removal in sulfite iodide uv cao et al 2021 richardson et al 2008 the potential risks of iodinated byproducts are of concern in the presence of oxidants richardson et al 2008 the problems about iodide may be mitigated through separating i by exchange resins or nanocomposites transforming i to nontoxic io3 or io4 or immobilizing i on inert carriers or catalysts liu et al 2022 more studies are required to optimize this process systematically and to evaluate the potential risks comprehensively prior to any suggestion on possible application of this process in water treatment and environmental remediation 4 conclusions this study provides an insight into kinetics mechanism and modeling of cr vi removal under alkaline conditions in sulfite iodide uv the following conclusions can be drawn 1 at alkaline phs cr vi removal followed pseudo zero order kinetics in the process and were accelerated by sulfite and iodide with a significant synergy 2 the cr vi removal were promoted by decreasing ph and increasing temperature with e a of about 40 7 kj mol 1 and were slightly influenced by dissolved oxygen carbonate and nom the process was still effective for cr vi removal in real surface water and industrial wastewater 3 both eaq and so3 accounted for cr vi removal making contributions of about 75 and 25 respectively when eaq mainly reacted with cr vi so3 participated in reduction of cr v and cr iv intermediates 4 pathways of cr vi removal were proposed reduction of cr vi proceeded via one electron transfer processes with cr iii as the final product and s iv was converted to s2o6 2 and so4 2 the specific s iv demand s iv 0 cr vi 0 for cr vi removal was about 2 1 1 5 a kinetic model was developed to predict cr vi removal the model not only well interpreted the roles of s iv and iodide and the synergy but also quantified the contributions of major reactive species in the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
