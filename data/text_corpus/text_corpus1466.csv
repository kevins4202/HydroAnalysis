7330,the nature of epiphreatic flow remains an important research challenge in karst hydrology this study focuses on the flood propagation along the epiphreatic system of reka timavo system kras carso plateau slovenia italy it is based on long term monitoring of basic physical parameters pressure level temperature specific electric conductivity of ground water in six active caves belonging to the flow system the system vigorously responds to flood events with stage rising 100 m in some of the caves besides presenting the response of the system to flood events of different scales the work focuses on the interpretation of recorded hydrographs in view of the known distribution and size of conduits and basic hydraulic relations furthermore the hydrographs were used to infer the unknown geometry between the observation points this way the main flow restrictors overflow passages and large epiphreatic storages were identified the assumptions were tested with a hydraulic model where the inversion procedure was used for an additional parameter optimisation time series of temperature and specific electric conductivity were used to assess the apparent velocities of flow between consecutive points keywords karst groundwater dynamics epiphreatic flow observation network modelling kras carso 1 introduction karst systems are characterised by networks of conduits within soluble rocks the evolution of conduit networks is guided by the structure lithology geochemical and hydraulic boundary conditions which are unique for each particular site these conditions give rise to different processes and mechanisms which in turn drive the system towards equilibrium when all the recharge is efficiently drained to the springs along the most efficient pathways dreybrodt et al 2005 ford and williams 2007 palmer 2007 in tectonically active areas karst systems continuously adapt to relatively rapid changes of structural and boundary conditions gabrovšek et al 2014 šebela 2009 most of these systems are not in equilibrium the flow pathways are characterised by high variability of channel cross sections and breakdowns the complex geometry and transient recharge is reflected in high dynamics of groundwater flow particularly the epiphreatic zone is characterised by intense response to flood events with high variability of flow rates flow velocities and water level fluctuations along the epiphreatic zone a fast transport of sediments potential pollutants and heat is conducted the flow in the epiphreatic channels may change from an open channel to pressurised giving rise to intense water level fluctuations and re activation of higher positioned conduits the epiphreatic zone also provides suitable locations for continuous monitoring of groundwater flow in karst aquifers as it is often accessible through vadose cave passages most studies of karst aquifers are focused to the recharge discharge relationships and transport properties caves as integral parts of the groundwater flow system can provide valuable monitoring sites for example jeannin 2001 monitored and modelled the intense hydraulic response in hölloch cave switzerland and successfully related it to the local cave geometry halihan and wicks 1998 and peterson and wicks 2006 modelled the hydraulic response of a well surveyed active cave system these and other works e g chen and goldscheider 2014 kaufmann et al 2016 demonstrate that basic hydraulic principles and models can be used to discuss the flood response of karst conduit systems when observations points are scattered in different caves of the same aquifers we have no initial information about the structure of the aquifer i e positions and dimensions of the conduits between the observation points however simultaneous long term monitoring of groundwater parameters within several caves of the same system may give important information about the structure and transport properties of the unknown parts this work is based on the long term record of basic physical parameters of underground flow within the active caves of the reka timavo system in kras carso plateau a boundary aquifer between sw slovenia and ne italy using hydrographs of stage temperature and specific electric conductivity sec the following questions are addressed how do different signals flood pulse temperature sec propagate through the system can we relate the known geometry of the system to the recorded hydrographs in caves can we infer the structure of unknown parts of the system from the recorded hydrographs the data analysis includes heuristic and statistical analysis of the hydrographs and optimisation based hydraulic modelling here we first provide an overview of the regional geological speleological and hydrological settings of this classic karst area section 2 we then describe the methods and monitoring sites section 3 and present the basic results of field observations section 4 a discussion of the results follows section 5 which offers insight into the underlying mechanisms the results of the hydraulic model are presented in section 6 and section 7 summarises the important conclusions derived from this study 2 regional settings 2 1 geological and hydrological settings of the kras carso plateau the kras carso plateau extends in a northwest southeast nw se direction between the bay of trieste in the southwest sw and the vipava valley in the northeast ne fig 1 the plateau is 40 km long and 13 km wide apart from the some higher mountains in the central part it has a low relief and is covered by numerous dolines and other karst features with about 4000 3000 in italy 1000 in slovenia known caves cucchi et al 2015 the surface generally dips from se to nw between 400 and 500 m a s l metres above sea level in the se down to 100 m a s l in the nw fig 2 presents the simplified geological situation the plateau is made up of a succession of cretaceous to lower paleogene carbonates deposited on the adriatic dinaric carbonate platform jurkovšek et al 2016 2013 1996 the geological structure of the broader area is a result of the collision between the apulian and eurasian lithospheric plates the kras plateau is an anticlinorium which structurally belongs to the external dinaric imbricated belt a part of the thrust system of external dinarides which furthermore underthrusts below the southern alps underthrusting also resulted in an en echalon formation of strike slip faults several fault systems cross the area typically along the so called dinaric se nw and cross dinaric direction the most recent structural description of the area can be found in placer 2015 some faults have been identified that affect the ground water flow šebela 2009 žvab et al 2015 the carbonates are surrounded by flysch which provides the input of allogenic water on the se while at the same time prevents outflow along the sw boundary this way the main flow is forced to follow the dinaric se nw direction along the nw coast of the trieste bay the topographical elevation of the limestone flysch contact is low enough to permit outflow through numerous karst springs among these the timavo springs with an average discharge of 30 m3 s are the most important figs 1 and 2 the reka river is the main allogenic input to the system 41 of its catchment is karstic and 54 is underlain by flysch it flows 50 km on the impermeable flysch rocks continues for another 7 km as a surface flow on a limestone terrain sinks at the škocjan caves and contributes to the springs in the trieste bay fig 1 the straight line distance between the škocjan caves and the timavo springs is 33 km the average discharge of the reka river in the period 2007 2013 was 7 1 m3 s while the long term average 1952 2013 is about 8 m3 s arso 2016 the ratio between the highest and the lowest flow rate is 1700 with the maximum measured discharge 305 m3 s and the minimum 0 18 m3 s it should be noted that the reka river makes an important contribution to the timavo springs during high flow however during mean and base flow most of the spring water originates from the soča alluvium in the nw doctor 2008 and from diffuse infiltration from rainwater civita et al 1995 in other words the soča river provides the base flow while the reka river and diffuse infiltration from the surface contribute the variability of the timavo and other springs the climate of the area is transitional from mediterranean to continental with precipitation ranging from 1400 mm y close to the adriatic sea to 1800 mm y in the inland ne part of the kras plateau yearly precipitation in the mountainous catchment of the reka river can reach 2000 mm these areas form an important orographic barrier where extreme precipitation events e g 250 mm in 12 h have been recorded 2 2 the epiphreatic system of the reka timavo system the kras carso plateau is a complex speleological environment with many relict caves distributed through the entire thickness of the vadose zone the sediments in the oldest topographically highest caves were dated to 5 ma zupan hajna et al 2008 the focus of this study is the epiphreatic zone which can be currently reached in ten caves between the škocjan caves and the spring line six of them where the system has been monitored are marked on the maps in figs 1 and 2 and on the profile in fig 3 details of the monitoring stations are given in section 3 the reka river reaches the flysch limestone boundary 7 km upstream from the škocjan caves before sinking underground it flows along a limestone canyon where it already loses some flow at the entrance to the škocjan caves the canyon turns into an underground channel with a cross section of 30 m by 40 m which is after few hundred metres interrupted by two large collapse dolines from where the river continues along an underground canyon 2 6 km long 10 m to 60 m wide and 80 m to 145 m high its terminal part is the martel s chamber with a volume of 2 2 106 m3 there the channel is interrupted by a cross dinaric fault šebela 2009 and the cross sectional area drops abruptly by roughly three orders of magnitude to only several tens of square metres here at 214 m a s l is the position of the first observation station p1 the flow follows a sequence of channels with a cross section of several tens of m2 and continues into a sump which is still unexplored but the connection to another sump 800 m nw in the kačna jama kačna cave snake s cave is not questionable kačna cave can be entered from the surface through a 186 m deep shaft that connects to a complex system of epiphreatic and vadose channels distributed along at least two distinct levels the cave is 13 km long and 280 m deep the lower epiphreatic level is dominated by the flow of the reka river which mostly flows in an open channel during low to medium hydrological conditions when water leaves the cave through the terminal sump at 156 m a s l the observation station p2 in kačna cave was in the section called brzice rapids 300 m upstream from the sump at 176 m a s l when the outflow capacity of the sump is exceeded water flows along a system of overflow channels following the se nw dinaric trend 2 km of the overflow channels interrupted by perched sumps have been explored currently sump no 4 is waiting for eventual new explorers historical markings organic debris of floods in kačna cave are 100 m above the base flow level the underground flow can be reached again 5 km to the sw in the jama 1 v kanjaducah the entrance has been known for over a century but only 15 years ago cavers succeeded to dig through a collapse pile just below the land surface and entered into a large steep gallery the cave is 330 m deep and 1 5 km long its geometry is rather simple dominated by the large inclined gallery which sinks practically uninterruptedly from 20 m below the surface to the reka river channel the main channel of the reka river is 60 m high 50 m wide and 600 m long it narrows and lowers only near the inflow and outflow sumps both sumps have been explored behind the outflow sump over 300 m of vadose passages were found that again end in sumps the observation station p3 23 m a s l was set up in the lake that continues in the outflow sump fig 4 about 2 6 km sw from p3 is the next observation point in brezno v stršinkni dolini the entrance is at 344 m a s l the cave follows a system of vadose shafts that lead to a large chamber where the underground flow is reached the observation point p4 is only 10 15 m above sea level along the floodwater maze the cave connects to another more recently explored cave these caves share a typical geometry with other caves in the lower part of the reka timavo system a system of vadose shafts that generally increase in size with depth and end with a large chamber often 100 m high and 1000 m2 in cross section the system of vadose shafts is connected via small channels that often required a lot of digging to pass the upstream sump from brezno v stršinkni dolini was explored by divers to a maximum depth of 60 m which is 38 m below sea level the most well known among the caves in the lower part of the reka timavo system is abisso di trebiciano labodnica cave about 1 km west from the brezno v stršinkni dolini just across the border in italy when explored in the 19th century it was the deepest cave at the time its depth is 329 m and reaches the reka timavo flow at about 12 m a s l where observation point p5 was set up the last observed cave was grotta miravigliosa lazzaro jerko a further 3 4 km nw from the town of trebiciano italy the low ground water stand in the cave is about 4 m a s l the observation point p6 was set up at this level in the outflowing sump recently several new caves have been explored to the level of the reka timavo flow these caves could become the future observation sites little is known about the structure of the deeper phreatic zone however the base level in the geological past was often well below the present spratt and lisiecki 2016 favouring conduit development in what is now a deep phreatic zone a well karstified phreatic zone is also indicated by the observation that during very dry periods when the discharge of the allogenic reka river falls below 500 l s the stream loses all its water before reaching the škocjan caves 2 3 past research the underground flow of the reka timavo system has been subject of numerous scientific studies since roman times including one of the first yet unsuccessful attempts at water tracing from 1599 kranjc 2013 previously flood responses of the reka timavo system have been studied with automatic measurements in caves by other authors cucchi and zini 2002 cucchi et al 2015 gabrovšek and peric 2006 zini et al 2014 2015 2010 zini et al 2015 who have addressed many questions and focused on the nature of the flood responses of the system and engineering challenges posed by the system such as those expected in potential tunnelling zini et al 2015 several water tracing experiments have proven the anticipated connections and revealed basic transport properties of the system petrič and kogovšek 2016 3 methods this work is based on long term automatic measurements of pressure temperature and specific electric conductivity sec in caves the hydrographs were carefully analysed and interpreted by use of basic hydraulic principles and known geometry of the system finally a hydraulic model of the system was developed and optimised to obtain the best fit to the recorded time series 3 1 field methods in the caves mentioned above p1 p6 and listed in table 2 autonomous loggers of pressure water level temperature and sec were placed the loggers were programmed to sample hourly and were fixed to the riverbed with stainless steel battens fig 4 eijkelkamp schlumberger ctd conductivity temperature depth and td temperature depth divers eijkelkamp 2017 were used at all sites except for the observation points p2 and p3 after 2012 where onset hobo loggers onset 2017 were used accuracy of the pressure transducers is 0 05 of the scale 100 m range loggers were used in this study while accuracy of the temperature sensors were 0 1 k pressure time series were not compensated for the barometric changes which are in our case 1 2 5 orders of magnitude smaller in the range of 0 25 m when converted to height of the water column than the changes triggered by flood events the recorded period spans between 2005 and 2013 the access to the observation stations is generally not easy some points are over 300 m below the surface and a whole day caving trip with extensive use of vertical techniques was required to reach them data from the loggers were downloaded at least once per year however due to the malfunctions or even physical removal of logger by torrential flow and occasional inaccessibility of observation points the data set is not continuous an overview of the available data is presented in table 1 3 2 hydrographs analyses basic statistical analyses and correlation plots of discharge and levels were made with originlab originlab 2017 the inflections on stage discharge curves were used to infer the local conduit geometry delays between diurnal extremes in temperature hydrographs and between characteristic knick points in sec hydrographs were used to assess the flow travel times between consecutive points 3 3 hydraulic model based on the known and inferred geometry of the conduit system a hydraulic model was constructed with storm water management model swmm developed by the us environmental protection agency epa 2014 swmm is primarily developed to simulate urban sewage systems but has found many implications to the karst conduit networks chen and goldscheider 2014 kaufmann et al 2016 peterson and wicks 2006 the model allows the simulation of many possible scenarios and permits the use of many elements of man made and natural hydraulic systems hence it is unnecessary to describe all aspects of the model here the model solves the full 1d saint venant s equation dingman 2002 for a network of conduits positioned in space to account for transition from an open channel to a full pipe flow a surcharge algorithm is used rossman 2009 in this work we used the full dynamical wave solution for calculations the model only accounts for the flow in conduits which limits its use to specific conditions of flood response in conduit dominated telogenetic aquifers 3 3 1 model construction the modelling domain consists of a series of conduits nodes and storage units fig 5 where the dimensions are known from cave surveys such as between p1 and p2 the model is better constrained in other areas only the fragments of conduits are known there an initial guess of geometry based on the stage hydrograph analyses was made and later optimised to fit the observations the swmm model is defined by nodes representing a rough sketch of the flow path geometry which are connected by open and closed rectangular elements and rectangular trapezoidal elements for the large galleries black lines in fig 5a and circular conduits for constrictions such as siphons and bypasses red lines in fig 5a some nodes have additional storage capacity to account for the large storage volume of the cave systems fig 6 conceptually shows the model elements and some of the parameters here two nodes one of which is a storage unit are connected with a conduit one can choose between a diversity of predefined and user defined channel cross sections and define channel dimensions a manning s roughness coefficient is assigned to each channel here an empirical value for the stony channels with cobbles n 0 035 was used each channel is connected to two nodes with a given invert elevation maximal and surcharge depths a channel can enter a node at a particular offset above the invert elevation nodes can be converted to storage units to which a power law or tabular curve is used to assign the dependence of surface area on the water level i e vertical distribution of storage nodes can be converted to outlets spring or flow dividers the water inflow is given to selected nodes here a recorded discharge of the reka river was given to the node representing the entrance to the škocjan caves 3 3 2 parameter refining by inversion based on the hydrographs interpretation and the known geometry of caves and position of the cave entrances the initial model was built the model consists of 34 conduits and 31 nodes of which six are storage units and one is an outfall the inversion procedure searches the parameter space to minimise the misfit between the observed field data and the swmm model results from the initially large set of parameters mainly the geometry of the conduits we selected five conduits from which our observations control the back flooding of the reka timavo system as restrictions to flow for these five conduits the diameters were then varied during the inversion procedure see table 4 in section 6 the inverse analysis was based on a neighbourhood na algorithm sambridge 1999a b which is a direct search method for nonlinear inverse problems it is a robust scheme particularly applicable for complex dependencies between the data and the model during the search stage of the na algorithm a multidimensional parameter space is sampled for a combinations of model parameters which provide a satisfactory fit to the observed data the search is guided by randomised decisions similar to techniques used for genetic algorithms ga and simulated annealing sa but the na algorithm needs only two control parameters a misfit between the model prediction and observation is calculated and the search is driven towards the minimum misfit within the parameter space the na algorithm is based on the geometrical concept of voronoi cells these voronoi cells are the nearest neighbour regions around each sampling point the voronoi cells are used to guide the sampling see sambridge 2001 for more details the fitting criterion used to assess the model quality is the root mean square rms fit rms j 1 n i 1 n h obs i h pred i x j h err 2 here h obs i and h pred i are observed and predicted stage values from all stations and all sampled times counter i 1 n x j is the parameter value vector our free parameter values and h err is a stage uncertainty set to 1 m a confidence criterion is given by ψ j 1 n i 1 n h pred i x best h pred i x j h err 2 with h best i and h pred i as the best fitting and the other predicted stage models x best is the parameter value vector for the best fitting model and x j is the general parameter value vector the ψ confidence parameter reports the goodness of fit with ψ 2 for models comparable with the best fit model within the 2 σ uncertainty and ψ 1 for models comparable with the best fit model within the 1 σ uncertainty 4 results 4 1 data overview the dataset of stage and discharge rate clearly shows few high floods when recharge surpassed 250 m3 s and the stage rose between 70 and 100 m fig 7 the surface temperature signal of the reka river is dampened along the flow path due to the heat exchange with the rock which equilibrates the water temperature with the temperature of the rock mass covington et al 2011 yearly temperature cycles and temperature disturbances during flood events are well observed throughout the monitored system diurnal temperature signals can be observed during flood recession at p1 p3 table 2 summarises basic temperature statistics at observed stations 4 2 characteristic flood events to get some insight into the typical hygrographs we present three characteristic flood events of increasing magnitude a small flood event peak flow 23 m3 s a medium flood peak flow 100 m3 s and a large flood event peak flow 250 m3 s 4 3 a small flood event fig 8 shows stage and temperature during a small flood event in september 2005 when the peak flow of the reka river reached 23 m3 s stage at p1 škocjan caves and p2 kačna cave show a small and almost identical response a higher increase is observed in the lower part of the system particularly at p5 labodnica trebiciano which preceded the responses at p3 and p4 the upstream p3 reacted before p4 as expected but shows a much longer recession temperature was disturbed throughout the system but only between p1 and p2 does it clearly follows the temperature trend of the reka river 4 4 a medium flood event a flood event from january 2006 qmax 87 m3 s is shown on fig 9 there is a clear difference between p1 where stage responded similarly as during the event on fig 8 and p2 where the stage rose abruptly 6 m h to 13 m reaching a peak at 16 m the stage remained above 8 m and then drops slowly until the discharge of reka river dropped below 15 m3 s when the recession curve inflects into a steeper segment stage response in p3 p5 is similar indicating an almost uniform water level in the lower part of the system the inflow of cold surface water disturbed temperatures along the whole system note the typical peaks of warm water which precede the arrival of the colder storm water between p3 and p5 this phenomenon is discussed in section 5 2 4 5 a large flood event the largest flood event recorded at all points occurred in december 2008 with discharge of the reka river reaching 250 m3 s at its peak fig 10 p1 and p2 reacted abruptly fast recession of stage at both locations followed the recharge recession however at p2 only to a certain level as in the medium flood event fig 9 where the recession almost stopped until the recharge dropped below 15 m3 s in the lower part of the system the levels rose between 84 m and 100 m the sensors have a 100 m range which was surpassed at p3 and p4 where the recording stopped during the event a simple extrapolation shows that the maximal level at p3 was 120 m a second event of similar magnitude and characteristics occurred in january 2009 5 discussion the recorded hygrographs provide a wealth of information on the system in this section we present a selection of data and discuss the underlying mechanisms leading to the observations the discussion follows the flow of the ground water starting in the uppermost part of the system p1 p2 and finishing at the downstream part p3 p6 5 1 the stage levels in the upper part of the system fig 11 shows stage discharge correlation plots between the reka river discharge and stage at p1 škocjan caves and p2 kačna cave fig 11a shows all available data when the discharge of reka river was 100 m3 s and fig 11b shows the largest recorded flood event in december 2008 as the discharge and stage were measured at different locations additional hysteresis in the q h diagram appears this was partially corrected by shifting the time points of the streamflow by 5 h forward which is about the travel time for water in the reka river to reach from the gaging station q to p1 during medium to high discharge for a better correction more data on travel times would be needed but this is not necessary for the discussion here a clear difference between p1 and p2 is shown in fig 11a while the level at p1 rises only for a few metres within the shown range of discharge 100 m3 s the level at p2 rises steeply to 8 10 m when discharge surpasses 15 m3 s at a discharge between 20 and 100 m3 s the rise in level is slow again the explanation of such behaviour can be given based on the known geometry of kačna cave p2 the flow from p2 continues to the sump at 156 m a s l which drains effectively all the water when discharge is below 15 m3 s at higher discharges the surplus of water is diverted through a system of overflow bypass channels with an apex at 8 10 m above p2 fig 12 fig 11b shows the flood event in december 2008 when peak discharge reached 260 m3 s at a flow rate of 130 m3 s the water levels in both caves showed an abrupt increase with discharge both curves are highly correlated indicating that the flooding was controlled by the channel geometry beyond p2 kačna cave furthermore both curves show several transitions between concave and convex shapes between 100 m3 s and 250 m3 s at the same discharge values to gain insight into this behaviour we qualitatively present how curve shapes may be related to the local geometry of the system 5 2 stage hydrograph inflection as indication of structure of the epiphreatic zone the stage can be generally approximated by a power function of discharge for an open channel flow the manning or chézy formula dingman 2002 gives the exponent of the relation below 1 for most reasonable channel geometries thus resulting in a concave curve if discharge increases and the conduit becomes pressurised resulting in back flooding of the chamber the darcy weisbach equation gives a parabolic relation between discharge and the head drop along the conduit so transitions between open channel and pressurised flow would result in inflections of stage discharge curve from concave to convex and vice versa fig 13 shows concept with a chamber drained by three conduits positioned at different levels although we have checked the concept numerically for the purpose here we describe the results qualitatively initially open channel flow along conduit 1 drains the chamber with increasing recharge conduit 1 becomes pressurised resulting in a parabolic increase of water level with discharge until water reaches the level of conduit 2 and the stage discharge curve becomes concave again the stage discharge curve is inflected back into a convex when conduit 2 becomes pressurised this scenario repeats again when water reaches conduit 3 5 3 displacement of the stored epiphreatic water going downstream temperature hydrographs of winter flood events show distinct initial rise at p3 p5 fig 9 such behaviour is often observed and explained by the so called piston effect which is characteristic for karst springs goldscheider and drew 2007 rapid infiltration increases the head in the aquifer and pushes the old stored water through the conduits and towards the springs so that this old water typically precedes the arrival of the storm water the stored water has a different temperature and chemical composition to that of the storm water since it is closer to chemical and thermal equilibrium with the rock however a closer look of the recorded hygrographs in this case reveals that the magnitude of the effect is much larger than just a disturbance before the arrival of cold storm water figs 9 14 16 fig 14 shows discharge levels and temperatures at p2 and p3 during the winter 2013 flood event with peak discharge of 80 m3 s before the event the levels had been low for over a month prior to the event the temperature at p2 was slightly above 3 c and at p3 7 c the water which flows through the sump beyond p2 warms up until it reaches p3 this is the initial temperature at p3 about two to three hours after the activation of the overflow galleries beyond the p2 the temperature at p3 rose abruptly and stayed elevated for 12 h thick blue segment on the p3 temperature hydrograph the rise of the temperature was also synchronous with the inflection of stage curve at p3 the shaded area in fig 14 note that the temperature peak lasts during most of the rising limb a similar situation with a similar scale and response to the event from january 2006 is shown in fig 15 with warm water peaks recorded also at p4 and p5 the plume of warm water first arrived at p3 and continued along the flow path to p4 and p5 later the temperature trends at all points follows that of the input temperature of the reka river and that of p1 and p2 fig 16 shows two consecutive flood events at the first event qmax 45 m3 s temperatures at p1 and p2 more or less follow the temperature pattern of the reka river at p3 p5 temperatures initially dropped and then rose similar to the case shown in figs 14 and 15 the rise at p3 kanjaduce followed the activation of bypass channels at p2 kačna cave the clear influence of warm water lasted for almost a day after that the temperature pattern in all the caves followed those of the upstream points a second flood pulse occurred four days later qmax 70 m3 s where no distinct temperature peaks were observed a series of such events were recorded observations can be summed up into the following points during the winter the flood events are characterised by inflow of warmer water between p2 and p3 the distinct peaks appear in all caves downstream from p3 the disturbance at p3 starts a few hours after the higher bypass galleries between p2 and p3 become active the temperature peaks can last from several hours to a day and are successively recorded at all observation points downstream from p3 distinct peaks are present when a flood event follows a long period with a low water stand considering that the average temperature of the water is a good indicator for an average temperature of the surrounding rock mass the expected equilibrium temperature of the rock massif between p2 and p3 is between 10 c and 10 5 c at the normal stage the water from p2 continues to p3 through the sump at 156 m a s l the water temperature between p2 and p3 is therefore between the temperatures at these observation points a plausible source area of the warm water during a flood event is the epiphreatic system of bypass galleries between p2 and p3 the known part of this system is a typical epiphreatic system of partially or fully flooded channels that can potentially store large amounts of water this water stays almost immobile between the storm events and equilibrates thermally to the local temperature of the rock mass it is only mobilised by the flood events when the bypass pathway becomes active this is also indicated by the fact that clear temperature peaks are recorded only when the level at p2 rises above the position of overflow galleries fig 17 schematically presents the concept discussed here it is tempting to assess the amount of stored water which is needed to change the temperatures as recorded let q2 and t2 be the flow and temperature of the reka river at p2 this water mixes with the water stored between p2 and p3 and the mixture is then recorded at p3 if qsto and tsto are the contribution and temperature of the water stored between p2 and p3 the temperature t3 at p3 would then be t 3 q 2 t 2 q sto t sto q 2 q sto giving q sto t 3 t 2 t sto t 3 q 2 this is a crude approximation the formula neglects the heat exchange of storm water with the rock furthermore the flow q2 must be known but let s assume that it is the same as the discharge of the reka river measured the gaging station shifted forward for 5 6 h we also do not know tsto but if the stored water is in thermal equilibrium with the massive it should be close to the average temperature between p2 and p3 during low water conditions which is 10 c fig 18 presents such estimation of qsto for one of the selected events the integration of qsto over the period of anomalous temperature at p3 shaded area in fig 18 gives the estimated volume of the stored water between p2 and p3 which is about 5 106 m3 since the parameters used are relatively undetermined the numerical value should be taken with some caution variation of the parameters within a reasonable interval results in volumes between 2 and 5 million cubic metres which clearly shows that a large amount of water is involved 5 4 the lower part of the system p3 p6 the stage hydrographs at p3 p6 are generally similar the base flow from p3 to p6 drops by 20 m over a distance of about 5 km resulting almost in a flat gradient during low flow conditions fig 19 shows a set of different scale events the small medium and large flood events discussed earlier as recorded at p3 p6 with levels shown in m a s l and time given in hours relative to the time of the peak level the rising and recession limbs show similar characteristics at all points the peak levels drop from p3 to p6 as expected due to the friction head drop in conduits along the flow direction the difference between peak levels is highest during the largest events during the extreme event in december 2008 the level was so high that the logger at p3 reached the maximum possible reading and the logger at p4 stopped working however we estimate that the level at p3 rose 130 m a s l and that the level dropped for 50 m between p3 and p6 correlation plots between levels at p3 p6 taken at the same time shown in fig 20 give some further insights curves for p3 p5 and p3 p6 fig 20b and c and to a lesser extent p4 p5 and p4 p6 fig 20d and e show a steep initial part due to the fast increase of the water level at lower positioned points until the level becomes almost uniform then the system becomes fully hydraulically connected and a simultaneous and relatively uniform rise at all points is recorded each individual flood event forms a hysteresis curve such as a flood event from february 2009 shown red in fig 20c there the time propagation of the flood is marked by grey arrows the area of the hysteresis curves for a particular flood increases with the magnitude of the flood event and with the distance between the points further theoretical work on this observation might give interesting results with implications for the interpretation of such curves 5 5 travel times and apparent flow velocities temperature and conductivity time series recorded simultaneously at all stations allow the assessment of travel times and apparent velocities between the stations covington et al 2011 derived a rule of thumb relation that the time scale of temperature variations and the underground travel time until these variations could be observable are comparable in other words diurnal oscillations can be tracked to the point which is reached by the surface inflowing water within a day when the diurnal temperature signal is well expressed the lag between two corresponding minima or maxima at two different stations is a good approximation of the travel time an example of diurnal temperature oscillations with growing lags between p1 p2 and p3 during flood recession are shown in fig 21 the successive delays in the temperature signal were record during the recession period following a flood event by contrast the inflow of fresh floodwater is also characterised by distinct drop in sec the temperature and sec records were analysed manually by calculating the lags between the temperature minima or maxima or between delays in the sec records about 20 such events were analysed and over 50 time lags between two or more stations were calculated the time lags are given in table 3 fig 22 shows the dependence of travel times and apparent velocities between p1 and p2 and between p2 and p3 on the flow rate the flow velocities in the system have been assessed with numerous dye tracing experiments where the tracer was injected into the reka river boreholes on the surface or in abisso di trebiciano p5 dominant flow velocities ranged from 50 m h between škocjan caves p1 and timavo springs at very low flow conditions to over 300 m h at discharge 90 m3 s civita et al 1995 petrič and kogovšek 2016 note that the time lags can generally be read only during relatively high flow which makes the velocities given in table 3 relatively high compared to those obtained in tracer tests 5 6 aeraulic response to flood events ongoing explorations are leading to discoveries of new caves in the lower part of the system similar to those observed here p3 p6 the question remains how many of such caves are there an idea of where new discoveries could be made can occur during flood events during flooding air is pressed out from large volume cavities resulting in numerous blowholes on the surface an example of the mechanism is shown in fig 23 in the jama 1 v kanjaducah p3 entrance passages the small cross section of the passageway causes a restriction to the air that is being pushed out during a flood event this results in a measurable increase of atmospheric pressure in the large gallery below red triangle on fig 23 and a fast air flow through the entrance passage green triangle in fig 23 enlargement and digging of such blowholes have resulted in the discovery of most of the caves in the lower part of the system with continuous progress being made there will still be a lot of digging needed to discover them unless an efficient geophysical method is developed instead 6 modelling results two large flood events those of december 2008 and february 2009 were selected for the inverse procedure initial conduit diameters given in table 4 were selected based on trial and error forward modelling these parameters were optimised during the inversion procedure which included 250 model runs the parameters of the best fit are given in table 4 fig 24 shows observed and modelled results for the points p1 p2 p3 and p6 for the february 2009 event points p4 and p5 did not record during that time this flood event was caused by a large rainfall event followed by two smaller rainfall events three and seven days after the big initial event the best fit model dashed black lines can as a first order approximation predict the observations red lines reasonably well both in amplitude and in shape the rms value for this model is 12 5 m however if we include higher elevation overflow passages between p3 and the outlet at the timavo springs as described above the fit of the recession limbs is improved dotted black lines but the rms value increases slightly to 16 5 m note that there is no change in the prediction for points p1 and p2 as they are far enough upstream of the additional overflow channels to not be affected fig 25 shows the modelled results for all six points for the december 2008 event here the succession of events that became more intensive with time is predicted again as a first order approximation the model predictions dashed black lines can approximate the observations red lines both in amplitude and shape rms 25 8 m the inclusion of the overflow channels between p3 and the timavo springs again decreases the amplitude and prolongs the recession limb rms 26 3 m although the inversion procedure provides a reasonable first order fit we must stay realistic the purpose of optimisation of an undetermined system as is the case here is not to constrain the parameters to high accuracy but to obtain hydraulic responses that are close to the measurements furthermore we only know a small part of the system from exploration and adding new conduits changes the picture considerably the model has only one outlet which is not the case of the kras carso plateau that consists of a series of springs however adding more outlets to the model has a negligible effect on the part of the system of interest in a better constrained system of underground flow of the pivka river in the nearby postojna cave kaufmann et al 2016 obtained a much better fit with a similar procedure 7 conclusions besides presenting fundamental observations of the hydrologic response this research has indicated new evidence on the structure of the conduit system we have related the dynamics of big flood events to the known and inferred conduit geometry between p1 and p3 and pointed to potential large reservoirs between p2 and p3 such a reservoir is a large potential habitat for subterranean aquatic species konec et al 2016 furthermore using temperature and sec as tracers we were able to establish travel times and apparent velocities within the system at various hydrological conditions observations show that the system is not in equilibrium to accommodate the flood pulses the sequence of large voids in the lower part of the system suggests that flooding plays an important role in their genesis even though genetic models have not yet been developed the evolution of such voids can be related to the evolution of collapse dolines as presented by gabrovšek and stepišnik 2011 and hiller et al 2014 although hydrological monitoring in caves often poses a physical challenge to researchers it provides many new insights into the nature of karst aquifers well positioned monitoring system can give valuable information on the structure of the unknown epiphreatic zone hydraulic connections between different observation points and in some also cases travel times between different points of the same flow system nevertheless the interpretation remains challenging as we still need to steer between firm scientific facts educated guesses and even border to speculations in this study we omitted the signal processing techniques of hydrograph records but focused to close inspections of the hydrographs combined with hydraulic reasoning based on simple hydraulic models we believe that this approach has good potential in future characterisation of karst aquifers hydraulic modelling can be a great interpretive tool but as stated before models of such systems should be taken with care the system will always be much more complex than any reasonable model could envisage the model presented here is essentially a linear line of conduits and reservoirs with some bypasses nevertheless the model is a critical testing tool which can enable educated guesses between the reasonable scientific facts and speculations however the data that we are getting from this and other similar systems still poses many interpretational challenges for future work acknowledgments this work has been realised within several bilateral and national projects

7330,the nature of epiphreatic flow remains an important research challenge in karst hydrology this study focuses on the flood propagation along the epiphreatic system of reka timavo system kras carso plateau slovenia italy it is based on long term monitoring of basic physical parameters pressure level temperature specific electric conductivity of ground water in six active caves belonging to the flow system the system vigorously responds to flood events with stage rising 100 m in some of the caves besides presenting the response of the system to flood events of different scales the work focuses on the interpretation of recorded hydrographs in view of the known distribution and size of conduits and basic hydraulic relations furthermore the hydrographs were used to infer the unknown geometry between the observation points this way the main flow restrictors overflow passages and large epiphreatic storages were identified the assumptions were tested with a hydraulic model where the inversion procedure was used for an additional parameter optimisation time series of temperature and specific electric conductivity were used to assess the apparent velocities of flow between consecutive points keywords karst groundwater dynamics epiphreatic flow observation network modelling kras carso 1 introduction karst systems are characterised by networks of conduits within soluble rocks the evolution of conduit networks is guided by the structure lithology geochemical and hydraulic boundary conditions which are unique for each particular site these conditions give rise to different processes and mechanisms which in turn drive the system towards equilibrium when all the recharge is efficiently drained to the springs along the most efficient pathways dreybrodt et al 2005 ford and williams 2007 palmer 2007 in tectonically active areas karst systems continuously adapt to relatively rapid changes of structural and boundary conditions gabrovšek et al 2014 šebela 2009 most of these systems are not in equilibrium the flow pathways are characterised by high variability of channel cross sections and breakdowns the complex geometry and transient recharge is reflected in high dynamics of groundwater flow particularly the epiphreatic zone is characterised by intense response to flood events with high variability of flow rates flow velocities and water level fluctuations along the epiphreatic zone a fast transport of sediments potential pollutants and heat is conducted the flow in the epiphreatic channels may change from an open channel to pressurised giving rise to intense water level fluctuations and re activation of higher positioned conduits the epiphreatic zone also provides suitable locations for continuous monitoring of groundwater flow in karst aquifers as it is often accessible through vadose cave passages most studies of karst aquifers are focused to the recharge discharge relationships and transport properties caves as integral parts of the groundwater flow system can provide valuable monitoring sites for example jeannin 2001 monitored and modelled the intense hydraulic response in hölloch cave switzerland and successfully related it to the local cave geometry halihan and wicks 1998 and peterson and wicks 2006 modelled the hydraulic response of a well surveyed active cave system these and other works e g chen and goldscheider 2014 kaufmann et al 2016 demonstrate that basic hydraulic principles and models can be used to discuss the flood response of karst conduit systems when observations points are scattered in different caves of the same aquifers we have no initial information about the structure of the aquifer i e positions and dimensions of the conduits between the observation points however simultaneous long term monitoring of groundwater parameters within several caves of the same system may give important information about the structure and transport properties of the unknown parts this work is based on the long term record of basic physical parameters of underground flow within the active caves of the reka timavo system in kras carso plateau a boundary aquifer between sw slovenia and ne italy using hydrographs of stage temperature and specific electric conductivity sec the following questions are addressed how do different signals flood pulse temperature sec propagate through the system can we relate the known geometry of the system to the recorded hydrographs in caves can we infer the structure of unknown parts of the system from the recorded hydrographs the data analysis includes heuristic and statistical analysis of the hydrographs and optimisation based hydraulic modelling here we first provide an overview of the regional geological speleological and hydrological settings of this classic karst area section 2 we then describe the methods and monitoring sites section 3 and present the basic results of field observations section 4 a discussion of the results follows section 5 which offers insight into the underlying mechanisms the results of the hydraulic model are presented in section 6 and section 7 summarises the important conclusions derived from this study 2 regional settings 2 1 geological and hydrological settings of the kras carso plateau the kras carso plateau extends in a northwest southeast nw se direction between the bay of trieste in the southwest sw and the vipava valley in the northeast ne fig 1 the plateau is 40 km long and 13 km wide apart from the some higher mountains in the central part it has a low relief and is covered by numerous dolines and other karst features with about 4000 3000 in italy 1000 in slovenia known caves cucchi et al 2015 the surface generally dips from se to nw between 400 and 500 m a s l metres above sea level in the se down to 100 m a s l in the nw fig 2 presents the simplified geological situation the plateau is made up of a succession of cretaceous to lower paleogene carbonates deposited on the adriatic dinaric carbonate platform jurkovšek et al 2016 2013 1996 the geological structure of the broader area is a result of the collision between the apulian and eurasian lithospheric plates the kras plateau is an anticlinorium which structurally belongs to the external dinaric imbricated belt a part of the thrust system of external dinarides which furthermore underthrusts below the southern alps underthrusting also resulted in an en echalon formation of strike slip faults several fault systems cross the area typically along the so called dinaric se nw and cross dinaric direction the most recent structural description of the area can be found in placer 2015 some faults have been identified that affect the ground water flow šebela 2009 žvab et al 2015 the carbonates are surrounded by flysch which provides the input of allogenic water on the se while at the same time prevents outflow along the sw boundary this way the main flow is forced to follow the dinaric se nw direction along the nw coast of the trieste bay the topographical elevation of the limestone flysch contact is low enough to permit outflow through numerous karst springs among these the timavo springs with an average discharge of 30 m3 s are the most important figs 1 and 2 the reka river is the main allogenic input to the system 41 of its catchment is karstic and 54 is underlain by flysch it flows 50 km on the impermeable flysch rocks continues for another 7 km as a surface flow on a limestone terrain sinks at the škocjan caves and contributes to the springs in the trieste bay fig 1 the straight line distance between the škocjan caves and the timavo springs is 33 km the average discharge of the reka river in the period 2007 2013 was 7 1 m3 s while the long term average 1952 2013 is about 8 m3 s arso 2016 the ratio between the highest and the lowest flow rate is 1700 with the maximum measured discharge 305 m3 s and the minimum 0 18 m3 s it should be noted that the reka river makes an important contribution to the timavo springs during high flow however during mean and base flow most of the spring water originates from the soča alluvium in the nw doctor 2008 and from diffuse infiltration from rainwater civita et al 1995 in other words the soča river provides the base flow while the reka river and diffuse infiltration from the surface contribute the variability of the timavo and other springs the climate of the area is transitional from mediterranean to continental with precipitation ranging from 1400 mm y close to the adriatic sea to 1800 mm y in the inland ne part of the kras plateau yearly precipitation in the mountainous catchment of the reka river can reach 2000 mm these areas form an important orographic barrier where extreme precipitation events e g 250 mm in 12 h have been recorded 2 2 the epiphreatic system of the reka timavo system the kras carso plateau is a complex speleological environment with many relict caves distributed through the entire thickness of the vadose zone the sediments in the oldest topographically highest caves were dated to 5 ma zupan hajna et al 2008 the focus of this study is the epiphreatic zone which can be currently reached in ten caves between the škocjan caves and the spring line six of them where the system has been monitored are marked on the maps in figs 1 and 2 and on the profile in fig 3 details of the monitoring stations are given in section 3 the reka river reaches the flysch limestone boundary 7 km upstream from the škocjan caves before sinking underground it flows along a limestone canyon where it already loses some flow at the entrance to the škocjan caves the canyon turns into an underground channel with a cross section of 30 m by 40 m which is after few hundred metres interrupted by two large collapse dolines from where the river continues along an underground canyon 2 6 km long 10 m to 60 m wide and 80 m to 145 m high its terminal part is the martel s chamber with a volume of 2 2 106 m3 there the channel is interrupted by a cross dinaric fault šebela 2009 and the cross sectional area drops abruptly by roughly three orders of magnitude to only several tens of square metres here at 214 m a s l is the position of the first observation station p1 the flow follows a sequence of channels with a cross section of several tens of m2 and continues into a sump which is still unexplored but the connection to another sump 800 m nw in the kačna jama kačna cave snake s cave is not questionable kačna cave can be entered from the surface through a 186 m deep shaft that connects to a complex system of epiphreatic and vadose channels distributed along at least two distinct levels the cave is 13 km long and 280 m deep the lower epiphreatic level is dominated by the flow of the reka river which mostly flows in an open channel during low to medium hydrological conditions when water leaves the cave through the terminal sump at 156 m a s l the observation station p2 in kačna cave was in the section called brzice rapids 300 m upstream from the sump at 176 m a s l when the outflow capacity of the sump is exceeded water flows along a system of overflow channels following the se nw dinaric trend 2 km of the overflow channels interrupted by perched sumps have been explored currently sump no 4 is waiting for eventual new explorers historical markings organic debris of floods in kačna cave are 100 m above the base flow level the underground flow can be reached again 5 km to the sw in the jama 1 v kanjaducah the entrance has been known for over a century but only 15 years ago cavers succeeded to dig through a collapse pile just below the land surface and entered into a large steep gallery the cave is 330 m deep and 1 5 km long its geometry is rather simple dominated by the large inclined gallery which sinks practically uninterruptedly from 20 m below the surface to the reka river channel the main channel of the reka river is 60 m high 50 m wide and 600 m long it narrows and lowers only near the inflow and outflow sumps both sumps have been explored behind the outflow sump over 300 m of vadose passages were found that again end in sumps the observation station p3 23 m a s l was set up in the lake that continues in the outflow sump fig 4 about 2 6 km sw from p3 is the next observation point in brezno v stršinkni dolini the entrance is at 344 m a s l the cave follows a system of vadose shafts that lead to a large chamber where the underground flow is reached the observation point p4 is only 10 15 m above sea level along the floodwater maze the cave connects to another more recently explored cave these caves share a typical geometry with other caves in the lower part of the reka timavo system a system of vadose shafts that generally increase in size with depth and end with a large chamber often 100 m high and 1000 m2 in cross section the system of vadose shafts is connected via small channels that often required a lot of digging to pass the upstream sump from brezno v stršinkni dolini was explored by divers to a maximum depth of 60 m which is 38 m below sea level the most well known among the caves in the lower part of the reka timavo system is abisso di trebiciano labodnica cave about 1 km west from the brezno v stršinkni dolini just across the border in italy when explored in the 19th century it was the deepest cave at the time its depth is 329 m and reaches the reka timavo flow at about 12 m a s l where observation point p5 was set up the last observed cave was grotta miravigliosa lazzaro jerko a further 3 4 km nw from the town of trebiciano italy the low ground water stand in the cave is about 4 m a s l the observation point p6 was set up at this level in the outflowing sump recently several new caves have been explored to the level of the reka timavo flow these caves could become the future observation sites little is known about the structure of the deeper phreatic zone however the base level in the geological past was often well below the present spratt and lisiecki 2016 favouring conduit development in what is now a deep phreatic zone a well karstified phreatic zone is also indicated by the observation that during very dry periods when the discharge of the allogenic reka river falls below 500 l s the stream loses all its water before reaching the škocjan caves 2 3 past research the underground flow of the reka timavo system has been subject of numerous scientific studies since roman times including one of the first yet unsuccessful attempts at water tracing from 1599 kranjc 2013 previously flood responses of the reka timavo system have been studied with automatic measurements in caves by other authors cucchi and zini 2002 cucchi et al 2015 gabrovšek and peric 2006 zini et al 2014 2015 2010 zini et al 2015 who have addressed many questions and focused on the nature of the flood responses of the system and engineering challenges posed by the system such as those expected in potential tunnelling zini et al 2015 several water tracing experiments have proven the anticipated connections and revealed basic transport properties of the system petrič and kogovšek 2016 3 methods this work is based on long term automatic measurements of pressure temperature and specific electric conductivity sec in caves the hydrographs were carefully analysed and interpreted by use of basic hydraulic principles and known geometry of the system finally a hydraulic model of the system was developed and optimised to obtain the best fit to the recorded time series 3 1 field methods in the caves mentioned above p1 p6 and listed in table 2 autonomous loggers of pressure water level temperature and sec were placed the loggers were programmed to sample hourly and were fixed to the riverbed with stainless steel battens fig 4 eijkelkamp schlumberger ctd conductivity temperature depth and td temperature depth divers eijkelkamp 2017 were used at all sites except for the observation points p2 and p3 after 2012 where onset hobo loggers onset 2017 were used accuracy of the pressure transducers is 0 05 of the scale 100 m range loggers were used in this study while accuracy of the temperature sensors were 0 1 k pressure time series were not compensated for the barometric changes which are in our case 1 2 5 orders of magnitude smaller in the range of 0 25 m when converted to height of the water column than the changes triggered by flood events the recorded period spans between 2005 and 2013 the access to the observation stations is generally not easy some points are over 300 m below the surface and a whole day caving trip with extensive use of vertical techniques was required to reach them data from the loggers were downloaded at least once per year however due to the malfunctions or even physical removal of logger by torrential flow and occasional inaccessibility of observation points the data set is not continuous an overview of the available data is presented in table 1 3 2 hydrographs analyses basic statistical analyses and correlation plots of discharge and levels were made with originlab originlab 2017 the inflections on stage discharge curves were used to infer the local conduit geometry delays between diurnal extremes in temperature hydrographs and between characteristic knick points in sec hydrographs were used to assess the flow travel times between consecutive points 3 3 hydraulic model based on the known and inferred geometry of the conduit system a hydraulic model was constructed with storm water management model swmm developed by the us environmental protection agency epa 2014 swmm is primarily developed to simulate urban sewage systems but has found many implications to the karst conduit networks chen and goldscheider 2014 kaufmann et al 2016 peterson and wicks 2006 the model allows the simulation of many possible scenarios and permits the use of many elements of man made and natural hydraulic systems hence it is unnecessary to describe all aspects of the model here the model solves the full 1d saint venant s equation dingman 2002 for a network of conduits positioned in space to account for transition from an open channel to a full pipe flow a surcharge algorithm is used rossman 2009 in this work we used the full dynamical wave solution for calculations the model only accounts for the flow in conduits which limits its use to specific conditions of flood response in conduit dominated telogenetic aquifers 3 3 1 model construction the modelling domain consists of a series of conduits nodes and storage units fig 5 where the dimensions are known from cave surveys such as between p1 and p2 the model is better constrained in other areas only the fragments of conduits are known there an initial guess of geometry based on the stage hydrograph analyses was made and later optimised to fit the observations the swmm model is defined by nodes representing a rough sketch of the flow path geometry which are connected by open and closed rectangular elements and rectangular trapezoidal elements for the large galleries black lines in fig 5a and circular conduits for constrictions such as siphons and bypasses red lines in fig 5a some nodes have additional storage capacity to account for the large storage volume of the cave systems fig 6 conceptually shows the model elements and some of the parameters here two nodes one of which is a storage unit are connected with a conduit one can choose between a diversity of predefined and user defined channel cross sections and define channel dimensions a manning s roughness coefficient is assigned to each channel here an empirical value for the stony channels with cobbles n 0 035 was used each channel is connected to two nodes with a given invert elevation maximal and surcharge depths a channel can enter a node at a particular offset above the invert elevation nodes can be converted to storage units to which a power law or tabular curve is used to assign the dependence of surface area on the water level i e vertical distribution of storage nodes can be converted to outlets spring or flow dividers the water inflow is given to selected nodes here a recorded discharge of the reka river was given to the node representing the entrance to the škocjan caves 3 3 2 parameter refining by inversion based on the hydrographs interpretation and the known geometry of caves and position of the cave entrances the initial model was built the model consists of 34 conduits and 31 nodes of which six are storage units and one is an outfall the inversion procedure searches the parameter space to minimise the misfit between the observed field data and the swmm model results from the initially large set of parameters mainly the geometry of the conduits we selected five conduits from which our observations control the back flooding of the reka timavo system as restrictions to flow for these five conduits the diameters were then varied during the inversion procedure see table 4 in section 6 the inverse analysis was based on a neighbourhood na algorithm sambridge 1999a b which is a direct search method for nonlinear inverse problems it is a robust scheme particularly applicable for complex dependencies between the data and the model during the search stage of the na algorithm a multidimensional parameter space is sampled for a combinations of model parameters which provide a satisfactory fit to the observed data the search is guided by randomised decisions similar to techniques used for genetic algorithms ga and simulated annealing sa but the na algorithm needs only two control parameters a misfit between the model prediction and observation is calculated and the search is driven towards the minimum misfit within the parameter space the na algorithm is based on the geometrical concept of voronoi cells these voronoi cells are the nearest neighbour regions around each sampling point the voronoi cells are used to guide the sampling see sambridge 2001 for more details the fitting criterion used to assess the model quality is the root mean square rms fit rms j 1 n i 1 n h obs i h pred i x j h err 2 here h obs i and h pred i are observed and predicted stage values from all stations and all sampled times counter i 1 n x j is the parameter value vector our free parameter values and h err is a stage uncertainty set to 1 m a confidence criterion is given by ψ j 1 n i 1 n h pred i x best h pred i x j h err 2 with h best i and h pred i as the best fitting and the other predicted stage models x best is the parameter value vector for the best fitting model and x j is the general parameter value vector the ψ confidence parameter reports the goodness of fit with ψ 2 for models comparable with the best fit model within the 2 σ uncertainty and ψ 1 for models comparable with the best fit model within the 1 σ uncertainty 4 results 4 1 data overview the dataset of stage and discharge rate clearly shows few high floods when recharge surpassed 250 m3 s and the stage rose between 70 and 100 m fig 7 the surface temperature signal of the reka river is dampened along the flow path due to the heat exchange with the rock which equilibrates the water temperature with the temperature of the rock mass covington et al 2011 yearly temperature cycles and temperature disturbances during flood events are well observed throughout the monitored system diurnal temperature signals can be observed during flood recession at p1 p3 table 2 summarises basic temperature statistics at observed stations 4 2 characteristic flood events to get some insight into the typical hygrographs we present three characteristic flood events of increasing magnitude a small flood event peak flow 23 m3 s a medium flood peak flow 100 m3 s and a large flood event peak flow 250 m3 s 4 3 a small flood event fig 8 shows stage and temperature during a small flood event in september 2005 when the peak flow of the reka river reached 23 m3 s stage at p1 škocjan caves and p2 kačna cave show a small and almost identical response a higher increase is observed in the lower part of the system particularly at p5 labodnica trebiciano which preceded the responses at p3 and p4 the upstream p3 reacted before p4 as expected but shows a much longer recession temperature was disturbed throughout the system but only between p1 and p2 does it clearly follows the temperature trend of the reka river 4 4 a medium flood event a flood event from january 2006 qmax 87 m3 s is shown on fig 9 there is a clear difference between p1 where stage responded similarly as during the event on fig 8 and p2 where the stage rose abruptly 6 m h to 13 m reaching a peak at 16 m the stage remained above 8 m and then drops slowly until the discharge of reka river dropped below 15 m3 s when the recession curve inflects into a steeper segment stage response in p3 p5 is similar indicating an almost uniform water level in the lower part of the system the inflow of cold surface water disturbed temperatures along the whole system note the typical peaks of warm water which precede the arrival of the colder storm water between p3 and p5 this phenomenon is discussed in section 5 2 4 5 a large flood event the largest flood event recorded at all points occurred in december 2008 with discharge of the reka river reaching 250 m3 s at its peak fig 10 p1 and p2 reacted abruptly fast recession of stage at both locations followed the recharge recession however at p2 only to a certain level as in the medium flood event fig 9 where the recession almost stopped until the recharge dropped below 15 m3 s in the lower part of the system the levels rose between 84 m and 100 m the sensors have a 100 m range which was surpassed at p3 and p4 where the recording stopped during the event a simple extrapolation shows that the maximal level at p3 was 120 m a second event of similar magnitude and characteristics occurred in january 2009 5 discussion the recorded hygrographs provide a wealth of information on the system in this section we present a selection of data and discuss the underlying mechanisms leading to the observations the discussion follows the flow of the ground water starting in the uppermost part of the system p1 p2 and finishing at the downstream part p3 p6 5 1 the stage levels in the upper part of the system fig 11 shows stage discharge correlation plots between the reka river discharge and stage at p1 škocjan caves and p2 kačna cave fig 11a shows all available data when the discharge of reka river was 100 m3 s and fig 11b shows the largest recorded flood event in december 2008 as the discharge and stage were measured at different locations additional hysteresis in the q h diagram appears this was partially corrected by shifting the time points of the streamflow by 5 h forward which is about the travel time for water in the reka river to reach from the gaging station q to p1 during medium to high discharge for a better correction more data on travel times would be needed but this is not necessary for the discussion here a clear difference between p1 and p2 is shown in fig 11a while the level at p1 rises only for a few metres within the shown range of discharge 100 m3 s the level at p2 rises steeply to 8 10 m when discharge surpasses 15 m3 s at a discharge between 20 and 100 m3 s the rise in level is slow again the explanation of such behaviour can be given based on the known geometry of kačna cave p2 the flow from p2 continues to the sump at 156 m a s l which drains effectively all the water when discharge is below 15 m3 s at higher discharges the surplus of water is diverted through a system of overflow bypass channels with an apex at 8 10 m above p2 fig 12 fig 11b shows the flood event in december 2008 when peak discharge reached 260 m3 s at a flow rate of 130 m3 s the water levels in both caves showed an abrupt increase with discharge both curves are highly correlated indicating that the flooding was controlled by the channel geometry beyond p2 kačna cave furthermore both curves show several transitions between concave and convex shapes between 100 m3 s and 250 m3 s at the same discharge values to gain insight into this behaviour we qualitatively present how curve shapes may be related to the local geometry of the system 5 2 stage hydrograph inflection as indication of structure of the epiphreatic zone the stage can be generally approximated by a power function of discharge for an open channel flow the manning or chézy formula dingman 2002 gives the exponent of the relation below 1 for most reasonable channel geometries thus resulting in a concave curve if discharge increases and the conduit becomes pressurised resulting in back flooding of the chamber the darcy weisbach equation gives a parabolic relation between discharge and the head drop along the conduit so transitions between open channel and pressurised flow would result in inflections of stage discharge curve from concave to convex and vice versa fig 13 shows concept with a chamber drained by three conduits positioned at different levels although we have checked the concept numerically for the purpose here we describe the results qualitatively initially open channel flow along conduit 1 drains the chamber with increasing recharge conduit 1 becomes pressurised resulting in a parabolic increase of water level with discharge until water reaches the level of conduit 2 and the stage discharge curve becomes concave again the stage discharge curve is inflected back into a convex when conduit 2 becomes pressurised this scenario repeats again when water reaches conduit 3 5 3 displacement of the stored epiphreatic water going downstream temperature hydrographs of winter flood events show distinct initial rise at p3 p5 fig 9 such behaviour is often observed and explained by the so called piston effect which is characteristic for karst springs goldscheider and drew 2007 rapid infiltration increases the head in the aquifer and pushes the old stored water through the conduits and towards the springs so that this old water typically precedes the arrival of the storm water the stored water has a different temperature and chemical composition to that of the storm water since it is closer to chemical and thermal equilibrium with the rock however a closer look of the recorded hygrographs in this case reveals that the magnitude of the effect is much larger than just a disturbance before the arrival of cold storm water figs 9 14 16 fig 14 shows discharge levels and temperatures at p2 and p3 during the winter 2013 flood event with peak discharge of 80 m3 s before the event the levels had been low for over a month prior to the event the temperature at p2 was slightly above 3 c and at p3 7 c the water which flows through the sump beyond p2 warms up until it reaches p3 this is the initial temperature at p3 about two to three hours after the activation of the overflow galleries beyond the p2 the temperature at p3 rose abruptly and stayed elevated for 12 h thick blue segment on the p3 temperature hydrograph the rise of the temperature was also synchronous with the inflection of stage curve at p3 the shaded area in fig 14 note that the temperature peak lasts during most of the rising limb a similar situation with a similar scale and response to the event from january 2006 is shown in fig 15 with warm water peaks recorded also at p4 and p5 the plume of warm water first arrived at p3 and continued along the flow path to p4 and p5 later the temperature trends at all points follows that of the input temperature of the reka river and that of p1 and p2 fig 16 shows two consecutive flood events at the first event qmax 45 m3 s temperatures at p1 and p2 more or less follow the temperature pattern of the reka river at p3 p5 temperatures initially dropped and then rose similar to the case shown in figs 14 and 15 the rise at p3 kanjaduce followed the activation of bypass channels at p2 kačna cave the clear influence of warm water lasted for almost a day after that the temperature pattern in all the caves followed those of the upstream points a second flood pulse occurred four days later qmax 70 m3 s where no distinct temperature peaks were observed a series of such events were recorded observations can be summed up into the following points during the winter the flood events are characterised by inflow of warmer water between p2 and p3 the distinct peaks appear in all caves downstream from p3 the disturbance at p3 starts a few hours after the higher bypass galleries between p2 and p3 become active the temperature peaks can last from several hours to a day and are successively recorded at all observation points downstream from p3 distinct peaks are present when a flood event follows a long period with a low water stand considering that the average temperature of the water is a good indicator for an average temperature of the surrounding rock mass the expected equilibrium temperature of the rock massif between p2 and p3 is between 10 c and 10 5 c at the normal stage the water from p2 continues to p3 through the sump at 156 m a s l the water temperature between p2 and p3 is therefore between the temperatures at these observation points a plausible source area of the warm water during a flood event is the epiphreatic system of bypass galleries between p2 and p3 the known part of this system is a typical epiphreatic system of partially or fully flooded channels that can potentially store large amounts of water this water stays almost immobile between the storm events and equilibrates thermally to the local temperature of the rock mass it is only mobilised by the flood events when the bypass pathway becomes active this is also indicated by the fact that clear temperature peaks are recorded only when the level at p2 rises above the position of overflow galleries fig 17 schematically presents the concept discussed here it is tempting to assess the amount of stored water which is needed to change the temperatures as recorded let q2 and t2 be the flow and temperature of the reka river at p2 this water mixes with the water stored between p2 and p3 and the mixture is then recorded at p3 if qsto and tsto are the contribution and temperature of the water stored between p2 and p3 the temperature t3 at p3 would then be t 3 q 2 t 2 q sto t sto q 2 q sto giving q sto t 3 t 2 t sto t 3 q 2 this is a crude approximation the formula neglects the heat exchange of storm water with the rock furthermore the flow q2 must be known but let s assume that it is the same as the discharge of the reka river measured the gaging station shifted forward for 5 6 h we also do not know tsto but if the stored water is in thermal equilibrium with the massive it should be close to the average temperature between p2 and p3 during low water conditions which is 10 c fig 18 presents such estimation of qsto for one of the selected events the integration of qsto over the period of anomalous temperature at p3 shaded area in fig 18 gives the estimated volume of the stored water between p2 and p3 which is about 5 106 m3 since the parameters used are relatively undetermined the numerical value should be taken with some caution variation of the parameters within a reasonable interval results in volumes between 2 and 5 million cubic metres which clearly shows that a large amount of water is involved 5 4 the lower part of the system p3 p6 the stage hydrographs at p3 p6 are generally similar the base flow from p3 to p6 drops by 20 m over a distance of about 5 km resulting almost in a flat gradient during low flow conditions fig 19 shows a set of different scale events the small medium and large flood events discussed earlier as recorded at p3 p6 with levels shown in m a s l and time given in hours relative to the time of the peak level the rising and recession limbs show similar characteristics at all points the peak levels drop from p3 to p6 as expected due to the friction head drop in conduits along the flow direction the difference between peak levels is highest during the largest events during the extreme event in december 2008 the level was so high that the logger at p3 reached the maximum possible reading and the logger at p4 stopped working however we estimate that the level at p3 rose 130 m a s l and that the level dropped for 50 m between p3 and p6 correlation plots between levels at p3 p6 taken at the same time shown in fig 20 give some further insights curves for p3 p5 and p3 p6 fig 20b and c and to a lesser extent p4 p5 and p4 p6 fig 20d and e show a steep initial part due to the fast increase of the water level at lower positioned points until the level becomes almost uniform then the system becomes fully hydraulically connected and a simultaneous and relatively uniform rise at all points is recorded each individual flood event forms a hysteresis curve such as a flood event from february 2009 shown red in fig 20c there the time propagation of the flood is marked by grey arrows the area of the hysteresis curves for a particular flood increases with the magnitude of the flood event and with the distance between the points further theoretical work on this observation might give interesting results with implications for the interpretation of such curves 5 5 travel times and apparent flow velocities temperature and conductivity time series recorded simultaneously at all stations allow the assessment of travel times and apparent velocities between the stations covington et al 2011 derived a rule of thumb relation that the time scale of temperature variations and the underground travel time until these variations could be observable are comparable in other words diurnal oscillations can be tracked to the point which is reached by the surface inflowing water within a day when the diurnal temperature signal is well expressed the lag between two corresponding minima or maxima at two different stations is a good approximation of the travel time an example of diurnal temperature oscillations with growing lags between p1 p2 and p3 during flood recession are shown in fig 21 the successive delays in the temperature signal were record during the recession period following a flood event by contrast the inflow of fresh floodwater is also characterised by distinct drop in sec the temperature and sec records were analysed manually by calculating the lags between the temperature minima or maxima or between delays in the sec records about 20 such events were analysed and over 50 time lags between two or more stations were calculated the time lags are given in table 3 fig 22 shows the dependence of travel times and apparent velocities between p1 and p2 and between p2 and p3 on the flow rate the flow velocities in the system have been assessed with numerous dye tracing experiments where the tracer was injected into the reka river boreholes on the surface or in abisso di trebiciano p5 dominant flow velocities ranged from 50 m h between škocjan caves p1 and timavo springs at very low flow conditions to over 300 m h at discharge 90 m3 s civita et al 1995 petrič and kogovšek 2016 note that the time lags can generally be read only during relatively high flow which makes the velocities given in table 3 relatively high compared to those obtained in tracer tests 5 6 aeraulic response to flood events ongoing explorations are leading to discoveries of new caves in the lower part of the system similar to those observed here p3 p6 the question remains how many of such caves are there an idea of where new discoveries could be made can occur during flood events during flooding air is pressed out from large volume cavities resulting in numerous blowholes on the surface an example of the mechanism is shown in fig 23 in the jama 1 v kanjaducah p3 entrance passages the small cross section of the passageway causes a restriction to the air that is being pushed out during a flood event this results in a measurable increase of atmospheric pressure in the large gallery below red triangle on fig 23 and a fast air flow through the entrance passage green triangle in fig 23 enlargement and digging of such blowholes have resulted in the discovery of most of the caves in the lower part of the system with continuous progress being made there will still be a lot of digging needed to discover them unless an efficient geophysical method is developed instead 6 modelling results two large flood events those of december 2008 and february 2009 were selected for the inverse procedure initial conduit diameters given in table 4 were selected based on trial and error forward modelling these parameters were optimised during the inversion procedure which included 250 model runs the parameters of the best fit are given in table 4 fig 24 shows observed and modelled results for the points p1 p2 p3 and p6 for the february 2009 event points p4 and p5 did not record during that time this flood event was caused by a large rainfall event followed by two smaller rainfall events three and seven days after the big initial event the best fit model dashed black lines can as a first order approximation predict the observations red lines reasonably well both in amplitude and in shape the rms value for this model is 12 5 m however if we include higher elevation overflow passages between p3 and the outlet at the timavo springs as described above the fit of the recession limbs is improved dotted black lines but the rms value increases slightly to 16 5 m note that there is no change in the prediction for points p1 and p2 as they are far enough upstream of the additional overflow channels to not be affected fig 25 shows the modelled results for all six points for the december 2008 event here the succession of events that became more intensive with time is predicted again as a first order approximation the model predictions dashed black lines can approximate the observations red lines both in amplitude and shape rms 25 8 m the inclusion of the overflow channels between p3 and the timavo springs again decreases the amplitude and prolongs the recession limb rms 26 3 m although the inversion procedure provides a reasonable first order fit we must stay realistic the purpose of optimisation of an undetermined system as is the case here is not to constrain the parameters to high accuracy but to obtain hydraulic responses that are close to the measurements furthermore we only know a small part of the system from exploration and adding new conduits changes the picture considerably the model has only one outlet which is not the case of the kras carso plateau that consists of a series of springs however adding more outlets to the model has a negligible effect on the part of the system of interest in a better constrained system of underground flow of the pivka river in the nearby postojna cave kaufmann et al 2016 obtained a much better fit with a similar procedure 7 conclusions besides presenting fundamental observations of the hydrologic response this research has indicated new evidence on the structure of the conduit system we have related the dynamics of big flood events to the known and inferred conduit geometry between p1 and p3 and pointed to potential large reservoirs between p2 and p3 such a reservoir is a large potential habitat for subterranean aquatic species konec et al 2016 furthermore using temperature and sec as tracers we were able to establish travel times and apparent velocities within the system at various hydrological conditions observations show that the system is not in equilibrium to accommodate the flood pulses the sequence of large voids in the lower part of the system suggests that flooding plays an important role in their genesis even though genetic models have not yet been developed the evolution of such voids can be related to the evolution of collapse dolines as presented by gabrovšek and stepišnik 2011 and hiller et al 2014 although hydrological monitoring in caves often poses a physical challenge to researchers it provides many new insights into the nature of karst aquifers well positioned monitoring system can give valuable information on the structure of the unknown epiphreatic zone hydraulic connections between different observation points and in some also cases travel times between different points of the same flow system nevertheless the interpretation remains challenging as we still need to steer between firm scientific facts educated guesses and even border to speculations in this study we omitted the signal processing techniques of hydrograph records but focused to close inspections of the hydrographs combined with hydraulic reasoning based on simple hydraulic models we believe that this approach has good potential in future characterisation of karst aquifers hydraulic modelling can be a great interpretive tool but as stated before models of such systems should be taken with care the system will always be much more complex than any reasonable model could envisage the model presented here is essentially a linear line of conduits and reservoirs with some bypasses nevertheless the model is a critical testing tool which can enable educated guesses between the reasonable scientific facts and speculations however the data that we are getting from this and other similar systems still poses many interpretational challenges for future work acknowledgments this work has been realised within several bilateral and national projects

7331,urban road surface roughness is one of the most important factors in estimation of surface runoff loads caused by road deposited sediment rds wash off and design of its control measures however because of a lack of experimental data to distinguish the role of surface roughness the effects of surface roughness on rds accumulation and release are not clear in this study paired asphalt and concrete road surfaces and rainfall simulation designs were used to distinguish the role of surface roughness in rds build up and wash off our results showed that typical asphalt surfaces often have higher depression depths than typical concrete surfaces indicating that asphalt surfaces are relatively rougher than concrete surface asphalt surfaces can retain a larger rds amount relative higher percentage of coarser particles larger rds wash off loads and lower wash off percentage than concrete surfaces surface roughness has different effects in rds motilities with different particle sizes during rainfall runoff and the settleable particles 44 149 μm were notably influenced by it furthermore the first flush phenomenon tended to be greater on relatively smooth surfaces than relatively rough surfaces overall surface roughness plays an important role in influencing the complete process of rds build up and wash off on different road characteristics keywords road surface roughness asphalt and concrete surface build up and wash off first flush effect street cleaning effectiveness 1 introduction in urban areas impervious surfaces are often the dominant land use and pollutants from a number of specific activities such as traffic and atmospheric deposition accumulate on these surfaces liu et al 2014 vaze and chiew 2002 as the treatment rate of domestic sewage rises progressively in china and other countries stormwater runoff from urban impervious surface areas is increasingly becoming a major source of water pollution zhao et al 2016b road deposited sediment rds from impervious surfaces is an important carrier of contaminants often containing heavy metals at elevated concentrations and the most important stormwater sources egodawatta et al 2009 li et al 2015 sutherland 2003 thus an in depth understanding of rds wash off from impervious road surfaces is essential to estimate urban surface runoff pollution load and design methods to minimize adverse impacts on the receiving waters aryal et al 2017 impervious surfaces have significantly different hydrological characteristics and rds accumulation and wash off patterns than pervious surfaces and have therefore been extensively studied bai and li 2013 kim and sansalone 2008 moglen 2009 sansalone and kim 2008 most researchers agree that rds wash off from impervious surfaces is affected by various factors including rds build up rainfall intensity rainfall energy rds properties run off shear stress and surface characteristics pitt et al 2005 sansalone et al 1998 vaze and chiew 2002 among the various factors above the role of surface characteristics e g texture microtopography roughness and depression patterns in retaining and attenuating rds particles and inhibiting and trapping runoff water have largely been ignored mansell and rollet 2009 shaw et al 2009 2006 however only a few studies relevant to the rds wash off on road surface characteristics have been conducted and these have primarily focused on 1 comparison of the stormwater runoff quality of different road surfaces or land uses and 2 the surface runoff processes belonging to source limiting or transport limiting processes on asphalt and cement road surfaces gilbert and clausen 2006 liu et al 2014 steuer 1997 wang et al 2013 not much is known about how different road surface characteristics such as roughness and texture exert different effects on rds build up and wash off processes that lead to different stormwater qualities brodie 2007 liu et al 2014 however estimation of pollutant loadings and design of stormwater control measures are highly dependent on an in depth understanding of the complete process of rds build up and wash off on different road characteristics the rapid urbanization of china since the 1980s has resulted in enormous increases in urban impervious surfaces ma et al 2016 wu et al 2014 accordingly rds wash off from urban impervious surfaces is an increasing problem associated with the rapid urbanization of china that results in urban stormwater runoff pollution zhao et al 2016b zhu et al 2008 asphalt and concrete surfaces are two typical road surface types that comprise the greatest percentages of road surface areas in china liu et al 2014 these surfaces have textures and roughness values that are obviously different especially in the amount and spatial distribution of depression storage mansell and rollet 2009 shaw et al 2009 key pollutant processes such as build up and wash off can differ because of the different surface characteristics of asphalt and concrete surfaces therefore different treatment strategies are needed for asphalt and concrete roads gilbert and clausen 2006 however studies that simultaneously consider the rds build up process and rds wash off process on different road surfaces e g asphalt and concrete are scarce thus the following questions remain 1 how does road surface roughness influence the quantity and grain size distribution of rds 2 what are the influences of road surface characteristics on the heavy metal distribution in rds and potential pollution contribution in surface runoff to provide answers to these questions a paired asphalt and concrete road surfaces study design was conducted to investigate the influence of urban surface roughness on the complete process of rds build up and wash off on different road characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description beijing the capital of china is located at the northern tip of the roughly triangular north china plain and spans 16 800 km2 the mean annual temperature of beijing is 14 0 c and the average annual rainfall is 570 mm paired design which was used in this study is the most powerful design option for comparison of the role of urban surface roughness in the build up and wash off process of rds establishing a paired sampling site necessitates selection of asphalt and concrete road surfaces that are likely to have qualitatively similar responses to rds build up and wash off based on our on site investigation eight paired asphalt and concrete road surfaces were selected from the haidian and chaoyang districts of beijing china fig 1 we assumed that each paired road surface asphalt and concrete had a consistent rds source similar traffic characteristics the same population density similar street cleaning methods and frequencies and uniform surrounding environments this was to ensure that the significance of the effect of road surface roughness was determined using analysis of covariance fig 1 shows the eight paired road surfaces and table 1 gives the road surface characteristics 2 2 rds sample collection and grain size fraction paired rds samples were collected from each paired asphalt and concrete road surface using a domestic vacuum cleaner philips fc 6168 to vacuum from the central road marking to the curb rds samples were collected during october 17 25 2016 which followed an antecedent dry period of about 2 weeks the vacuum cleaner had high efficiency with an air filtration system and a cyclonic dustbin that effectively captures microscopic particulates all rds samples were dried at room temperature for 7 days then weighed using an electronic scale samples were subsequently sorted into particle size fractions of 44 44 62 62 105 105 149 149 250 250 450 450 1000 and 1000 μm using polyester sieves 2 3 characterization of surface roughness and quantification using depression depth although shaw et al 2009 used a high resolution scanner umax astra 4000u to characterize the surface roughness a suitable method for its quantification has not yet been developed in this study the road surface roughness was quantified using depression depth according to engineering standards and methods based on the principles set for the sand laying method quartz sand 50 ml with particles 100 μm was spread uniformly throughout the tested road surface with a ruler to calculate the size of the area the sand laying area was spread into a circular shape according to the national standards of the people s republic of china jtg e60 2008 field test methods of subgrade and pavement for highway engineering e60 2008 2008 the depression depth mm was calculated using the following equation 1 depression depth mm 1000 v π d 2 4 31831 d 2 where v is the volume of the sand with particles 100 μm ml and d is the diameter of the circle shape of the sand laying area mm 2 4 estimation of the contribution of different particle sizes to the overall heavy metal of rds using gsf load to determine the contribution of particle sizes to the overall contamination of rds we calculated the pollutant load percentage for each individual rds sample the particle size fraction load gsfload was calculated using the following equation sutherland 2003 2 gsf load c i gs i i 1 n c i gs i 100 where ci is the heavy metal level associated with a rds sample for a given particle size mg kg gsi is the percentage by mass of the size fraction i in the total sample and n is the number of particle size fractions 2 5 rainfall simulation experiment of rds wash off and estimation of the wash off percentage to better reveal the behavior of rds wash off with different grain size fractions a total of 42 different rainfall events were conducted with three rainfall intensities 29 90 40 78 80 67 mm h table 1 the mass of rds per unit area was 20 g m2 for all single particle size wash off tests many important factors have been shown to influence rds wash off in this simulated experiment we focused on the rainfall intensity and duration the rainfall simulation device consisted of two rainfall simulators with four nozzles veejet 80100 equally distributed with an interval of 1 1 m along the swing nozzle boom which stood at 2 5 m above the ground the nozzles generated uniform raindrops of medium size at a constant pressure of 0 04 mpa the two rainfall simulators generated a total uniform rainfall area of 1 5 m 2 2 m we selected an area of 1 5 m 2 0 m as our wash off test plot a 1 5 m 2 0 m plastic frame was used to demarcate the plot boundary which was sealed with a paved surface one end of the plastic frame was kept open to affix the catch tray used for runoff collection further details regarding the experimental design can be found in our previous study zhao et al 2011 the road selected for the rds wash off experimental plot was paved with asphalt 5 years prior to the experiment the wash off duration was 1 h during which time the runoff samples were collected manually at 2 min intervals in the first 10 min 5 min intervals during the second and third 10 min and 10 min intervals during the fourth sixth 10 min periods until there was no more surface runoff the wash off percentage fw of rds on each grain size fraction was expressed as a percentage of the total rds mass in the runoff with respect to the initial total mass of rds on the surface as follows zhao et al 2011 3 f w m f w m initial 100 0 1 c t q t dt m initial 100 where mfw is the mass of the size fraction washed off the surface over the entire rain event mg minitial is the initial mass of rds with a corresponding particle size on the surface mg c t is the mass of rds with a corresponding particle size in the surface runoff water mg l at each sampling time and q t is the surface runoff flow rate at each sampling time m3 min 2 6 calculation of heavy metals wash off load and wash off percentage in stormwater runoff the potential contribution of pollution washed off the surface to contamination of the runoff was calculated using the rds index model developed by zhao et al 2014 which used the simulation value of fw and the actual amount of rds build up on road surfaces to estimate as follows 4 rds index load j m i n m i c ij a f wi where rdsindex load is potential amount of pollutants in stormwater runoff kg mi is rds mass per unit area of a particle size i g m2 cij is rds concentration of heavy metal j associated with particles of size i mg kg a is road surface area m2 i j is number of particle sizes and heavy metal species the wash off percentage fw j of a certain heavy metal j on the bulk rds particle was expressed as a percentage of the metal wash off load in runoff with respect to the initial mass of the metal build up load in rds on the surface as follows 5 f w j load washoff j load buildup j rds index load j i n m i c ij a 100 i n m i c ij f wi i n m i c ij 100 where loadwashoff j is potential wash off load of a certain heavy metal j in stormwater runoff μg m2 loadwashoff j is a certain heavy metal j build up load in rds on surface μg m2 rdsindex load mi cij a i j have the same meaning as in eq 4 2 7 analytical methods and quality control we analyzed six heavy metal elements cd cr cu ni pb and zn for all rds using the standard methods apha 1999 rds samples were digested with hf hclo4 tessier et al 1979 the quality assurance and quality control qa qc procedures were conducted using certified reference materials crms gss 1 and gss 2 geochemical standard soil there were no crms available for rds the crms for soil used for quality control for rds were acceptable for some published references sutherland 2003 zhao et al 2010 all solutions were stored at 4 c prior to analysis the concentrations of cr cu ni pb and zn were determined using a perkin elmer elan 6000 icp oes the concentrations of cd were determined using an agilent 7500a icp ms agilent technologies usa for heavy metals analysis recoveries varied but all fell within the range of 76 95 the precision was nearly 8 with a confidence level of 95 reagent blanks were included with each batch of samples assayed runoff water samples collected in the rds wash off simulation experiment were filtered through pre weighed 0 45 μm millipore filter paper and solid particles remaining on the filter paper were dried and re weighed to quantify the total suspended solids tss apha 1999 3 results 3 1 the impact of surface roughness on rds build up loads the surface roughness was obviously different between asphalt and concrete road surfaces fig 2 a the asphalt surface depression depths for all paired road surfaces expect bop were larger than for concrete surfaces specifically they were 0 435 0 201 mm for asphalt road surfaces and 0 207 0 143 mm for concrete road surfaces these results implied that the concrete road surfaces were relatively smooth and the asphalt road surfaces could more easily retain rds particles than the concrete road surfaces additionally the outcomes of different paired road surfaces showed highly site specific variability in depression depth road surface roughness plays a significant role in rds mass per unit area for all paired asphalt and concrete surfaces except bop asphalt surfaces with larger values of depression depth have greater ability to retain larger amounts of rds these results indicate that a rougher road texture could facilitate the retention of rds on the surface and provide a larger supply of particles our previous studies also suggest that the efficiency of rds sweeping decreased with the rougher road texture resulting in increased storage of rds zhao and li 2013 zhao et al 2010 however the amount of rds retained by the road surface did not increase with increasing surface roughness the observed site specific variability of rds was primarily linked to road lay out efficiency of sweeping and road surface conditions and surrounding land use pal 2012 zhao et al 2010 road surface roughness also plays a significant role in rds grain size composition as shown in fig 2c a significant proportion of fine rds particles 105 μm on concrete surfaces occurs when compared to that on asphalt surfaces for all paired road surfaces during rds collection we found asphalt surfaces have much larger depression structures than concrete surfaces in terms of surface microtopography which may explain why asphalt surfaces retain larger amounts of rds and greater proportions of coarser particles than concrete surfaces the results also imply that rds retained by concrete surfaces could be more easily mobilized by stormwater runoff than that on asphalt surfaces because small particles do not require high kinetic energy to be washed off 3 2 impact of surface roughness on rds wash off percentage to evaluate the effects of surface roughness on the rds wash off process a total of 42 simulated rainfall events were designed and the rds availability per square meter was 20 g m2 as shown in fig 3 rds wash off from asphalt and concrete surfaces was found to follow similar trends but with different magnitudes the fw values of asphalt and concrete surfaces both vary with the particle size of rds and rainfall characteristics with smaller particle sizes and larger intensities being associated with higher values of fw the fw values from concrete and asphalt surfaces ranged from 5 5 to 88 and 3 3 to 72 respectively additionally the highest and lowest fw values were observed for particles with a diameter 44 μm with 80 6 mm h from concrete surfaces and particles with a diameter of 450 1000 μm with 40 7 mm h from asphalt surfaces respectively the fw values of each grain size fraction with different rainfall characteristics may be a direct reflection of the role of surface roughness in the rds wash off process generally the concrete surfaces have higher fw values than asphalt surfaces with the same rds particle size and the same rainfall characteristics and the concrete fw values increased by 15 200 compared to the asphalt values this means there was a highly mobile nature of rds on concrete surfaces and a relatively high risk posed by concrete surfaces in terms of the degradation of stormwater quality when the rds availability per square meter was the same furthermore the greatest difference in fw values between asphalt and concrete surfaces occurred for rds particles with diameters of 62 105 μm 105 149 μm and 149 250 μm with the corresponding rainfall characteristics these results imply that the depression depth has different effects on rds motilities for different particle sizes because different particles have different hydrodynamic characteristics during the rainfall runoff process this could explain why the mobilities of smaller particles that easily remain in suspension in runoff are less affected by the depression depth while those of larger particles that are easily separated by simple settling are easily trapped and inhibited by the depression depth andral et al 1999 sansalone and kim 2008 moreover the mobility of larger particles on asphalt surfaces require relatively high kinetic energy to be washed off relative to those on concrete surfaces brodie and rosewell 2007 3 3 impact of surface roughness on metal concentration for different particle sizes although many previous studies have revealed that the particle size distribution affected metal concentrations in rds samples li et al 2015 2013 liu et al 2016 sutherland 2003 few have investigated the impact of surface roughness on metal concentrations of different particle sizes as shown in fig 4 the effects of surface roughness on six metal concentrations attached to seven particle sizes were evaluated for asphalt and concrete road surfaces the results show that the differences in surface roughness between asphalt and concrete surfaces have no obvious effects on the heavy metals concentration however it is evident that for all paired asphalt and concrete surfaces almost 40 of the metal load is attached to particles 105 μm with a few exceptions additionally particles with a diameter 105 μm have higher cumulative values in most areas asphalt and concrete as indicated by the following values cd 50 and 67 cr 37 and 49 cu 48 and 62 ni 37 and 50 pb 39 and 53 and zn 45 and 58 generally all concrete surfaces have a higher degree of metal enrichment for finer particles than asphalt surfaces because they have a higher proportion of smaller particles this difference is reasonable because the particle size fraction 105 μm clay and silt has a high surface area and contains negatively charged particles which have a high affinity for metals kaur et al 2007 pal 2012 zhao et al 2009 the results further imply that metals concentrations in rds are primarily determined by their multiple source contributions and the surfaces roughness only indirectly influences metal concentrations via selective retention of different particle size fractions 3 4 impact of surface roughness on metal wash off loads rds wash off loads are essential to estimation of pollutant loadings and design of stormwater control measures in this study the potential contribution of pollution washed off the surface to contamination of the runoff was calculated using the simulation value of fw and the actual amount of rds build up on road surfaces as shown in fig 5 the rds and metals wash off loads were primarily determined by the amount of rds build up for all paired asphalt and concrete surfaces and rainfall characteristics these results suggest that surfaces roughness had smaller direct influence on rds and metals wash off loads than rds amount and rainfall characteristics while it had larger indirect influence via retention of the rds amount furthermore it is evident that for all paired surfaces concrete surfaces have higher values of bulk rds wash off than asphalt surfaces because the former have higher proportions of fine particles that are easily washed off the results indicated that asphalt surfaces generally had higher potential runoff pollution contributions per unit area while concrete surfaces often had higher proportions of rds wash off potential additionally this means the treatment design for asphalt and concrete surfaces should apply different strategies due to their different rds build up and wash off processes 4 discussion 4 1 impact of surface roughness on first flush load and removal effectiveness of street cleaning it is well known that a high removal efficiency of street cleaning is good stormwater control practice for the reduction of stormwater pollutants from road impervious surfaces many previous studies have shown that particle loadings road texture moisture frequency of cleaning and methods parked car conditions etc have important influences on estimating the effectiveness of street cleaning of rds amato et al 2010 pitt et al 2004 sartor et al 1974 the surface roughness can also have important effects on the removal efficiency to investigate the effects of surface roughness on different street cleaning methods a simulated street cleaning experiment was designed to compare the removal efficiency between two typical asphalt and concrete surfaces that were hand swept with brooms and a domestic vacuum cleaner as shown in table 2 both street cleaning methods had higher removal effectiveness on concrete than asphalt additionally both street cleaning methods had higher removal effectiveness for coarser particles than for finer particles these results indicated that relatively large depression depth values can primarily decrease the removal effectiveness of fine particles unfortunately the finer rds particles that remain after street cleaning could contribute most significantly to stormwater pollution and easily be re suspended become inhalable and pose potential human health hazards thus the relationship between fine particles and relative surface roughness should receive attention and advanced street cleaning equipment should be used for streets with relatively rough surfaces 4 2 impact of surface roughness on first flush phenomenon to assess the impact of urban surface runoff water quality and design in situ treatment strategies it is essential to have an in depth understanding of the first flush phenomenon of surface runoff caused by rds wash off deletic 1998 sansalone et al 1998 many previous studies have revealed that the first flush was influenced by many factors such as rainfall characteristics catchment area size the proportion of impervious area rds grain size composition and amount availability antecedent dry weather period pollutant species and phase lee et al 2002 liu et al 2014 sansalone and kim 2008 sheng et al 2008 vaze and chiew 2002 zhao et al 2016a however because of a lack of experimental data to distinguish the role of surface roughness in determining the wash off process its role in influencing the first flush of urban surface runoff is still not clear to investigate the effects of road surface roughness on first flush the simulated wash off rates and the actual rds characteristics on asphalt and concrete surfaces were used to calculate the first flush the curves of cumulative ss mass vs cumulative runoff volume were used to assess the effects of surface roughness on the first flush and the criteria of ff30 80 was used to define the first flush occurring according to gupta and saul 1996 as shown in fig 6 more of the rds wash off process values on concrete surfaces were close to and larger than the ff30 80 values when compared to the asphalt surface under 40 78 and 80 67 rainfall mm h furthermore the magnitude of the first flush phenomenon was found be greater for concrete surfaces than for asphalt surfaces with larger rainfall intensities additionally our results confirmed that rds wash off processes on asphalt and concrete surfaces tended to be source and transport limited respectively generally the first flush phenomenon tended to be greater on relatively smooth surfaces than on relatively rough surfaces 5 conclusions the road surface roughness has a comprehensive influence on the rds accumulation and release process 1 for each paired asphalt and concrete surface asphalt surfaces have higher depression depth values than concrete surfaces indicating that asphalt surfaces are relatively rough surface roughness has a direct influence on rds mass per unit area and grain size composition but no obvious influence on the metal concentrations in rds 2 the road surface roughness has direct and indirect effects on the rds wash off process surface roughness has different effects on rds motilities with different particle sizes during rainfall runoff and settleable particles 44 149 μm were notably influenced by this first flush phenomena tended to be greater the relatively smooth surfaces than relatively rough surfaces 3 asphalt surfaces can have larger rds wash off loads and lower wash off percentages than concrete surfaces additionally road surface roughness also has an indirect effect on the rds wash off process via the influence on rds amount and grain size composition 4 the road surface roughness also has an influence on rds removal the street cleaning effectiveness decreased obviously for finer particles on asphalt surfaces that were hand swept with a plastic brush relative to concrete

7331,urban road surface roughness is one of the most important factors in estimation of surface runoff loads caused by road deposited sediment rds wash off and design of its control measures however because of a lack of experimental data to distinguish the role of surface roughness the effects of surface roughness on rds accumulation and release are not clear in this study paired asphalt and concrete road surfaces and rainfall simulation designs were used to distinguish the role of surface roughness in rds build up and wash off our results showed that typical asphalt surfaces often have higher depression depths than typical concrete surfaces indicating that asphalt surfaces are relatively rougher than concrete surface asphalt surfaces can retain a larger rds amount relative higher percentage of coarser particles larger rds wash off loads and lower wash off percentage than concrete surfaces surface roughness has different effects in rds motilities with different particle sizes during rainfall runoff and the settleable particles 44 149 μm were notably influenced by it furthermore the first flush phenomenon tended to be greater on relatively smooth surfaces than relatively rough surfaces overall surface roughness plays an important role in influencing the complete process of rds build up and wash off on different road characteristics keywords road surface roughness asphalt and concrete surface build up and wash off first flush effect street cleaning effectiveness 1 introduction in urban areas impervious surfaces are often the dominant land use and pollutants from a number of specific activities such as traffic and atmospheric deposition accumulate on these surfaces liu et al 2014 vaze and chiew 2002 as the treatment rate of domestic sewage rises progressively in china and other countries stormwater runoff from urban impervious surface areas is increasingly becoming a major source of water pollution zhao et al 2016b road deposited sediment rds from impervious surfaces is an important carrier of contaminants often containing heavy metals at elevated concentrations and the most important stormwater sources egodawatta et al 2009 li et al 2015 sutherland 2003 thus an in depth understanding of rds wash off from impervious road surfaces is essential to estimate urban surface runoff pollution load and design methods to minimize adverse impacts on the receiving waters aryal et al 2017 impervious surfaces have significantly different hydrological characteristics and rds accumulation and wash off patterns than pervious surfaces and have therefore been extensively studied bai and li 2013 kim and sansalone 2008 moglen 2009 sansalone and kim 2008 most researchers agree that rds wash off from impervious surfaces is affected by various factors including rds build up rainfall intensity rainfall energy rds properties run off shear stress and surface characteristics pitt et al 2005 sansalone et al 1998 vaze and chiew 2002 among the various factors above the role of surface characteristics e g texture microtopography roughness and depression patterns in retaining and attenuating rds particles and inhibiting and trapping runoff water have largely been ignored mansell and rollet 2009 shaw et al 2009 2006 however only a few studies relevant to the rds wash off on road surface characteristics have been conducted and these have primarily focused on 1 comparison of the stormwater runoff quality of different road surfaces or land uses and 2 the surface runoff processes belonging to source limiting or transport limiting processes on asphalt and cement road surfaces gilbert and clausen 2006 liu et al 2014 steuer 1997 wang et al 2013 not much is known about how different road surface characteristics such as roughness and texture exert different effects on rds build up and wash off processes that lead to different stormwater qualities brodie 2007 liu et al 2014 however estimation of pollutant loadings and design of stormwater control measures are highly dependent on an in depth understanding of the complete process of rds build up and wash off on different road characteristics the rapid urbanization of china since the 1980s has resulted in enormous increases in urban impervious surfaces ma et al 2016 wu et al 2014 accordingly rds wash off from urban impervious surfaces is an increasing problem associated with the rapid urbanization of china that results in urban stormwater runoff pollution zhao et al 2016b zhu et al 2008 asphalt and concrete surfaces are two typical road surface types that comprise the greatest percentages of road surface areas in china liu et al 2014 these surfaces have textures and roughness values that are obviously different especially in the amount and spatial distribution of depression storage mansell and rollet 2009 shaw et al 2009 key pollutant processes such as build up and wash off can differ because of the different surface characteristics of asphalt and concrete surfaces therefore different treatment strategies are needed for asphalt and concrete roads gilbert and clausen 2006 however studies that simultaneously consider the rds build up process and rds wash off process on different road surfaces e g asphalt and concrete are scarce thus the following questions remain 1 how does road surface roughness influence the quantity and grain size distribution of rds 2 what are the influences of road surface characteristics on the heavy metal distribution in rds and potential pollution contribution in surface runoff to provide answers to these questions a paired asphalt and concrete road surfaces study design was conducted to investigate the influence of urban surface roughness on the complete process of rds build up and wash off on different road characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description beijing the capital of china is located at the northern tip of the roughly triangular north china plain and spans 16 800 km2 the mean annual temperature of beijing is 14 0 c and the average annual rainfall is 570 mm paired design which was used in this study is the most powerful design option for comparison of the role of urban surface roughness in the build up and wash off process of rds establishing a paired sampling site necessitates selection of asphalt and concrete road surfaces that are likely to have qualitatively similar responses to rds build up and wash off based on our on site investigation eight paired asphalt and concrete road surfaces were selected from the haidian and chaoyang districts of beijing china fig 1 we assumed that each paired road surface asphalt and concrete had a consistent rds source similar traffic characteristics the same population density similar street cleaning methods and frequencies and uniform surrounding environments this was to ensure that the significance of the effect of road surface roughness was determined using analysis of covariance fig 1 shows the eight paired road surfaces and table 1 gives the road surface characteristics 2 2 rds sample collection and grain size fraction paired rds samples were collected from each paired asphalt and concrete road surface using a domestic vacuum cleaner philips fc 6168 to vacuum from the central road marking to the curb rds samples were collected during october 17 25 2016 which followed an antecedent dry period of about 2 weeks the vacuum cleaner had high efficiency with an air filtration system and a cyclonic dustbin that effectively captures microscopic particulates all rds samples were dried at room temperature for 7 days then weighed using an electronic scale samples were subsequently sorted into particle size fractions of 44 44 62 62 105 105 149 149 250 250 450 450 1000 and 1000 μm using polyester sieves 2 3 characterization of surface roughness and quantification using depression depth although shaw et al 2009 used a high resolution scanner umax astra 4000u to characterize the surface roughness a suitable method for its quantification has not yet been developed in this study the road surface roughness was quantified using depression depth according to engineering standards and methods based on the principles set for the sand laying method quartz sand 50 ml with particles 100 μm was spread uniformly throughout the tested road surface with a ruler to calculate the size of the area the sand laying area was spread into a circular shape according to the national standards of the people s republic of china jtg e60 2008 field test methods of subgrade and pavement for highway engineering e60 2008 2008 the depression depth mm was calculated using the following equation 1 depression depth mm 1000 v π d 2 4 31831 d 2 where v is the volume of the sand with particles 100 μm ml and d is the diameter of the circle shape of the sand laying area mm 2 4 estimation of the contribution of different particle sizes to the overall heavy metal of rds using gsf load to determine the contribution of particle sizes to the overall contamination of rds we calculated the pollutant load percentage for each individual rds sample the particle size fraction load gsfload was calculated using the following equation sutherland 2003 2 gsf load c i gs i i 1 n c i gs i 100 where ci is the heavy metal level associated with a rds sample for a given particle size mg kg gsi is the percentage by mass of the size fraction i in the total sample and n is the number of particle size fractions 2 5 rainfall simulation experiment of rds wash off and estimation of the wash off percentage to better reveal the behavior of rds wash off with different grain size fractions a total of 42 different rainfall events were conducted with three rainfall intensities 29 90 40 78 80 67 mm h table 1 the mass of rds per unit area was 20 g m2 for all single particle size wash off tests many important factors have been shown to influence rds wash off in this simulated experiment we focused on the rainfall intensity and duration the rainfall simulation device consisted of two rainfall simulators with four nozzles veejet 80100 equally distributed with an interval of 1 1 m along the swing nozzle boom which stood at 2 5 m above the ground the nozzles generated uniform raindrops of medium size at a constant pressure of 0 04 mpa the two rainfall simulators generated a total uniform rainfall area of 1 5 m 2 2 m we selected an area of 1 5 m 2 0 m as our wash off test plot a 1 5 m 2 0 m plastic frame was used to demarcate the plot boundary which was sealed with a paved surface one end of the plastic frame was kept open to affix the catch tray used for runoff collection further details regarding the experimental design can be found in our previous study zhao et al 2011 the road selected for the rds wash off experimental plot was paved with asphalt 5 years prior to the experiment the wash off duration was 1 h during which time the runoff samples were collected manually at 2 min intervals in the first 10 min 5 min intervals during the second and third 10 min and 10 min intervals during the fourth sixth 10 min periods until there was no more surface runoff the wash off percentage fw of rds on each grain size fraction was expressed as a percentage of the total rds mass in the runoff with respect to the initial total mass of rds on the surface as follows zhao et al 2011 3 f w m f w m initial 100 0 1 c t q t dt m initial 100 where mfw is the mass of the size fraction washed off the surface over the entire rain event mg minitial is the initial mass of rds with a corresponding particle size on the surface mg c t is the mass of rds with a corresponding particle size in the surface runoff water mg l at each sampling time and q t is the surface runoff flow rate at each sampling time m3 min 2 6 calculation of heavy metals wash off load and wash off percentage in stormwater runoff the potential contribution of pollution washed off the surface to contamination of the runoff was calculated using the rds index model developed by zhao et al 2014 which used the simulation value of fw and the actual amount of rds build up on road surfaces to estimate as follows 4 rds index load j m i n m i c ij a f wi where rdsindex load is potential amount of pollutants in stormwater runoff kg mi is rds mass per unit area of a particle size i g m2 cij is rds concentration of heavy metal j associated with particles of size i mg kg a is road surface area m2 i j is number of particle sizes and heavy metal species the wash off percentage fw j of a certain heavy metal j on the bulk rds particle was expressed as a percentage of the metal wash off load in runoff with respect to the initial mass of the metal build up load in rds on the surface as follows 5 f w j load washoff j load buildup j rds index load j i n m i c ij a 100 i n m i c ij f wi i n m i c ij 100 where loadwashoff j is potential wash off load of a certain heavy metal j in stormwater runoff μg m2 loadwashoff j is a certain heavy metal j build up load in rds on surface μg m2 rdsindex load mi cij a i j have the same meaning as in eq 4 2 7 analytical methods and quality control we analyzed six heavy metal elements cd cr cu ni pb and zn for all rds using the standard methods apha 1999 rds samples were digested with hf hclo4 tessier et al 1979 the quality assurance and quality control qa qc procedures were conducted using certified reference materials crms gss 1 and gss 2 geochemical standard soil there were no crms available for rds the crms for soil used for quality control for rds were acceptable for some published references sutherland 2003 zhao et al 2010 all solutions were stored at 4 c prior to analysis the concentrations of cr cu ni pb and zn were determined using a perkin elmer elan 6000 icp oes the concentrations of cd were determined using an agilent 7500a icp ms agilent technologies usa for heavy metals analysis recoveries varied but all fell within the range of 76 95 the precision was nearly 8 with a confidence level of 95 reagent blanks were included with each batch of samples assayed runoff water samples collected in the rds wash off simulation experiment were filtered through pre weighed 0 45 μm millipore filter paper and solid particles remaining on the filter paper were dried and re weighed to quantify the total suspended solids tss apha 1999 3 results 3 1 the impact of surface roughness on rds build up loads the surface roughness was obviously different between asphalt and concrete road surfaces fig 2 a the asphalt surface depression depths for all paired road surfaces expect bop were larger than for concrete surfaces specifically they were 0 435 0 201 mm for asphalt road surfaces and 0 207 0 143 mm for concrete road surfaces these results implied that the concrete road surfaces were relatively smooth and the asphalt road surfaces could more easily retain rds particles than the concrete road surfaces additionally the outcomes of different paired road surfaces showed highly site specific variability in depression depth road surface roughness plays a significant role in rds mass per unit area for all paired asphalt and concrete surfaces except bop asphalt surfaces with larger values of depression depth have greater ability to retain larger amounts of rds these results indicate that a rougher road texture could facilitate the retention of rds on the surface and provide a larger supply of particles our previous studies also suggest that the efficiency of rds sweeping decreased with the rougher road texture resulting in increased storage of rds zhao and li 2013 zhao et al 2010 however the amount of rds retained by the road surface did not increase with increasing surface roughness the observed site specific variability of rds was primarily linked to road lay out efficiency of sweeping and road surface conditions and surrounding land use pal 2012 zhao et al 2010 road surface roughness also plays a significant role in rds grain size composition as shown in fig 2c a significant proportion of fine rds particles 105 μm on concrete surfaces occurs when compared to that on asphalt surfaces for all paired road surfaces during rds collection we found asphalt surfaces have much larger depression structures than concrete surfaces in terms of surface microtopography which may explain why asphalt surfaces retain larger amounts of rds and greater proportions of coarser particles than concrete surfaces the results also imply that rds retained by concrete surfaces could be more easily mobilized by stormwater runoff than that on asphalt surfaces because small particles do not require high kinetic energy to be washed off 3 2 impact of surface roughness on rds wash off percentage to evaluate the effects of surface roughness on the rds wash off process a total of 42 simulated rainfall events were designed and the rds availability per square meter was 20 g m2 as shown in fig 3 rds wash off from asphalt and concrete surfaces was found to follow similar trends but with different magnitudes the fw values of asphalt and concrete surfaces both vary with the particle size of rds and rainfall characteristics with smaller particle sizes and larger intensities being associated with higher values of fw the fw values from concrete and asphalt surfaces ranged from 5 5 to 88 and 3 3 to 72

7 mm h from asphalt surfaces respectively the fw values of each grain size fraction with different rainfall characteristics may be a direct reflection of the role of surface roughness in the rds wash off process generally the concrete surfaces have higher fw values than asphalt surfaces with the same rds particle size and the same rainfall characteristics and the concrete fw values increased by 15 200 compared to the asphalt values this means there was a highly mobile nature of rds on concrete surfaces and a relatively high risk posed by concrete surfaces in terms of the degradation of stormwater quality when the rds availability per square meter was the same furthermore the greatest difference in fw values between asphalt and concrete surfaces occurred for rds particles with diameters of 62 105 μm 105 149 μm and 149 250 μm with the corresponding rainfall characteristics these results imply that the depression depth has different effects on rds motilities for different particle sizes because different particles have different hydrodynamic characteristics during the rainfall runoff process this could explain why the mobilities of smaller particles that easily remain in suspension in runoff are less affected by the depression depth while those of larger particles that are easily separated by simple settling are easily trapped and inhibited by the depression depth andral et al 1999 sansalone and kim 2008 moreover the mobility of larger particles on asphalt surfaces require relatively high kinetic energy to be washed off relative to those on concrete surfaces

asphalt surfaces because they have a higher proportion of smaller particles this difference is reasonable because the particle size fraction 105 μm clay and silt has a high surface area and contains

this means the treatment design for asphalt and concrete surfaces should apply different strategies due to their different rds build up and wash off processes 4 discussion 4 1 impact of surface

situation showed that shennongjia and shuiyuesi should convert 1201 76 ha and 1115 33 ha of dryland into forest areas respectively which represented the greatest changes in all regions in the watershed the results of this study indicated that ga and the clue s model can be used to optimize the land use patterns in the future and that swat can be used to evaluate the effect of land use optimization on non point source pollution control these methods may provide support for land use plan of an area keywords land use change non point source pollution clue s model swat model xiangxi watershed markov chain genetic algorithm 1 introduction non point source nps pollution has attracted much attention in recent years because it has a wide range of pollution sources and complex uncertainty and because it is more difficult to control than point source pollution ouyang et al 2014 huang et al 2015 luo et al 2015 excessive inputs of fertilizer and pesticides are the main sources for nps pollution and are caused by inappropriate agricultural development and the expansion of intensive livestock breeding sun et al 2012 nps pollution is an important source for the contamination of the water environment ongley et al 2010 zhang found that the total nitrogen and total phosphorus provided by agricultural nps pollution accounted for more than 50 of the total water pollution zhang et al 2004 in china water contamination caused by nps pollution has become increasingly serious and no marked improvement has occurred li et al 2016 due to the spatial and temporal variations of nps pollution it is difficult to conduct regular monitoring easton et al 2008 so many hydrological models have been developed and used to simulate the hydrological processes and water contamination yuan et al 2007 lai et al 2011 ryu et al 2016 soil and water assessment tool swat which is a powerful water quality model has been developed to predict the yield circulation of water sediment and nps pollution under different land use soil and management conditions on a watershed scale arnold et al 2012 the swat model has been widely used at various watersheds worldwide due to its satisfactory prediction accuracy ouyang et al 2014 huang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the generation of nps pollution is a complex process that is controlled by the interaction of different physical and chemical processes duncan 2014 nps pollution can be affected by several factors including the land use structure and distribution pattern the amount and characteristic of the pollutant environmental self purification ability and economic factors liu et al 2013b many studies have been carried out to analyze the effects of different factors on the generation of nps pollution as well as its migration and transformation dai et al 2015 reza et al 2016 oliveira et al 2017 among all the factors land use management is one of the most significant yuan et al 2017 different structures of land use categories can have a significant influence on both the nps contamination level and the spatial distribution pattern jha et al 2010 improper land use distribution patterns and management may lead to soil erosion and nutrient loss from surface runoff causing water eutrophication wang et al 2010 dai et al 2017 thus attention must be paid to optimizing the land use structure and distribution pattern zhang et al 2013 the conversion of land use and its effect at small regional extent clue s model is one of the most widely used models to simulate future land use changes lambin et al 2000 in recent years some researchers have combined the clue s and swat models to analyze the impact of land use change on the discharge of nps pollution zhang et al 2013 most such studies used the simple trend extrapolation method to predict the land use quantity liu et al 2014 jiang et al 2015a in clue s the simple trend extrapolation method is simple to use but it ignores the randomness of land use change in different years to overcome this weakness the markov chain method has been used to predict the land use change with randomness zheng et al 2015 wu et al 2017 however both simple trend extrapolation method and markov chain method are trend methods that predict the land use change based only on the historical trend without considering environmental social and economic factors these methods thus cannot be used to determine and optimized land use pattern thus optimized algorithm methods are required by combining an optimized algorithm with clue s and swat models an optimized land use pattern can be obtained to support the future land use plan and the effect of land use plan on controlling non point source pollution can be evaluated in this study land use change and its effect on nps pollution were investigated in the xiangxi river watershed based on the clue s and swat models the main goals of this study were to 1 evaluate the performance of the two land use quantity prediction methods i e markov chain method and ga method 2 analyze the impacts of land use change on non point source pollution discharge and 3 provide a method for supporting land use plan by combining the ga method clue s model and swat model to control non point source pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the xiangxi river watershed is located between 110 47 and 111 13 e 30 96 and 31 67 n and it covers an area of 3099 km2 fig 1 the river is 94 km long runs from shennongjia forestry district sn through xingshan county xs and flows into the yangtze river in xiangxi town of zigui county zg the area has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 1213 3 mm and an average temperature of 17 8 c more than 70 9 of the area was covered by forest but due to the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir the land use pattern has changed rapidly in recent years purple soil is dominant in the arable area with a proportion of 78 7 the watershed has faced serious nps pollution which is caused mainly by the excessive application of fertilizer and unreasonable livestock breeding liu et al 2015 strehmel et al 2016 2 2 model description 2 2 1 markov chain the markov chain model is based on the markov stochastic process system and is used to predict the change to one status from another status muller and middleton 1994 a process satisfies the markov property if the prediction of the process for the future is based only on the present status and is independent from the historical status sang et al 2011 markov chain has been applied as a statistical model to simulate real world processes in many research fields such as population growth predictions and currency exchange rates cohen 2014 hu and zhu 2016 the process of land use change can be considered a markov process and predicted by markov chain fathizad et al 2015 mondal et al 2017 however it can only be used to predict the quantity of land use change not the spatial change the prediction of land use change is calculated by the following equations 1 a t 1 a t p 2 p p 11 p 12 p 1 i p 21 p 22 p 2 i p i 1 p i 2 p ii where a t and a t 1 are the land use area vectors at time t and t 1 respectively p is the matrix of land use transition probability i is the count of land use categories the calculation of p is the key point when using the markov chain method in this study the matrix of land use transition probability was calculated based on the land use area in 2000 and the area change for each land use category from 2000 to 2010 the area changes for each land use category was calculated by using the overlay analysis in arcgis between the land use maps of 2000 and 2010 the matrix was considered the historical trend of land use change and was kept invariant in the prediction process 2 2 2 genetic algorithm genetic algorithm ga which is an evolutionary algorithm was inspired by the process of biological evolution that are observed in nature such as crossover mutation and selection li and parrott 2016 ga has been widely used to generate high quality solutions to optimization and search problems nourmohammadzadeh and hartmann 2016 arikoglu 2017 kadri and boctor 2018 the procedure of ga has four parts generate initial population crossover operation mutation operation and selection in this study ga was used to predict the land use quantity change under environmental social and economic constraints the minimum total phosphorus load was set as the objective function and was calculated by the export coefficient method population size was selected as the social constraint to limit the predicted urban area within a reasonable range without this limit an excessively large area would be allocated to the urban land the constraint of basic farmland area was set to ensure the food supply gross domestic product gdp was selected as the economic constraint to maintain the balance between environmental protection and economic development in fact many factors should be controlled when optimizing the land use allocation including crop yield and ecological effects however these factors are not absolutely independent and may have the same effects on the control of land use allocation for example when gdp was set as the constraint condition the constraint of crop yield can be excluded because gdp can reflect the crop yield condition to some extent and because gdp is a more comprehensive factor than other similar factors in addition more constraints may lead to the misconvergence of the genetic algorithm thus considering both the availability of the data and the performance of the genetic algorithm only the factors mentioned above were used as constraint conditions 2 2 3 clue s model the conversion of land use and its effect at small regional extent clue s model consists of two individual modules a spatial allocation module and a demand module the demand module calculates the amount of area change for all land use types and the spatial allocation module assigns the area changes to different locations based on the raster system jiang et al 2015a for the demand module several methods can be used to calculate the area change including trend extrapolations markov model and complex economic models verburg et al 2002 zheng et al 2015 method selection depends on the data availability and accuracy requirements for the spatial allocation module the distribution of land use types is based on the probability map of the study area the calculation equation is defined as follows mas et al 2014 3 tprop i u p i u elas u iter u where tprop i u is the total probability of land use type u for grid cell i elas u is the relative elasticity for change of land use type u iter u is a variable for model iteration p i u is the probability for grid cell i to have its land use type u calculated by logistic regression as follows 4 log p i u 1 p i u β 0 β 1 x 1 i β 2 x 2 i β n x n i where the xs are the driving factors and have a direct or indirect relationship with the land use types and will affect the allocation of land use types and the β s are the coefficients corresponding to the driving factors in this study the digital elevation model dem slope aspect soil categories distance to road distance to river distance to town and population density were selected as the driving factors because they were reported to have significant effects on land use xu et al 2013 jiang et al 2015b the elasticity coefficient elas u was set according to the references and expert advice verburg et al 2002 pan et al 2010 two scenarios of land use quantity prediction were used in scenario one markov chain method was used to predict the quantity of each land use type in 2020 in this scenario land use change was assumed to obey the historical trend in scenario two the optimized land use quantity demand in 2020 was simulated by the ga method the reference information was obtained from a year book of the study area and the field research 2 2 4 swat model the physically based continuously distributed hydrological model swat soil and water assessment tool version 2012 was developed by the u s department of agriculture agriculture research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 the model is widely used to simulate the effect of management practices on hydrology condition and water quality on a watershed scale on a daily time step the water balance is calculated at the hydrological response units hrus level aggregated at the subbasin level and finally routed to the reaches and the watershed outlet grusson et al 2015 the water balance is calculated as follows 5 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil moisture content of day i sw 0 is the initial soil moisture content of day i r day is the rainfall of day i q surf is the surface runoff of day i e a is the evapotranspiration of day i w seep is the water transferred from soil profile into the gas zone of day i and q gw is the return flow of day i swat model was used to simulate the non point source pollution under different land use pattern point source pollution simulation was ignored because its amount was insignificant compared to that of non point source pollution in the study area wang et al 2012 liu et al 2013a 2 2 5 calibration and validation methods for clue s model the relative elasticity coefficient can have an obvious effect on the spatial allocation of land use types thus it is of great significance to calibrate it kappa coefficient can be used as the objective function to evaluate the simulation accuracy zhang et al 2013 the value of kappa coefficient ranges from 1 to 1 the higher the value is the more accurate the simulation is the kappa coefficient is calculated as follows 6 kappa p 0 p c p p p c where p 0 is the correct simulation proportion p c is the correct simulation proportion under random condition and p p is the correct simulation proportion under ideal conditions for the swat model swat cup was used to perform the calibration and validation procedure sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 was chosen as the calibration algorithm because it is effective when used in a large watershed rostamian et al 2008 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r 2 were used as objective functions to evaluate the performance of the swat model eqs 7 and 8 7 nse i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 o i o 2 8 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where o i is the i th observed value o is the mean value of observed values p i is the i th predicted value p is the mean value of predicted values and n is the total number of sample pairs 2 3 input data and model setup spatial information data and social statistics data were collected as input for the clue s and swat models dem data was obtained from the second version of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model dataset http www gscloud cn the average elevation of the study area is 1567 m with the lowest and highest elevations of 95 m and 3093 m respectively fig 2 a slope and aspect data were generated in arcgis based on the dem data the slope was larger in the north of the study area with the maximum slope of approximately 75 fig 2b and c a soil map 30 m resolution was obtained from the institute of geography chinese academy of sciences there are 10 kinds of soil types in the study area and limestone soil and yellow brown soil have the largest areas fig 2d land use data of 2000 and 2010 were interpreted from the landsat5 tm dataset from the website at a resolution of 30 m weather data including precipitation temperature wind relative humidity and solar radiation were collected from 9 weather stations in the watershed the spatial locations of rivers roads and towns in the study area were digitized in arcgis based on maps of zg xs and sn counties population density and land use demand in 2020 were obtained from the statistical yearbook stream flow data from 2002 to 2011 and organic and inorganic phosphorus orgp minp data from 2004 to 2011 were collected from the yichang hydrographic office the markov chain and ga methods were used to predict the land use quantity demand in 2020 the results were used as input data for the clue s land use demand module clue s was used to simulate how the land use pattern in 2010 changed from that in 2000 based on the driving factors the simulated land use in 2010 was compared with the real land use pattern in 2010 to determine whether the simulation was accurate then the land use pattern in 2020 was predicted under two different scenarios i e historical trend scenario and optimized scenario when running the swat model to simulate nps pollution calibration and validation of flow and phosphorus load were carried out first then the real land use map in 2010 and the predicted land use map in 2020 simulated by clue s were used as input data for swat to simulate the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads and their spatial distributions in the watershed in order to emphasize the effect of land use change on the nps pollution discharge the other input data and corresponding coefficients were kept invariable during the simulation by comparing the simulation results from the clue s and swat models an assistance map was drawn using overlay analysis to support the land use plan in the xiangxi river watershed in 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation a simulation of land use change from 2000 to 2010 was conducted the kappa coefficient was 0 89 showing that the simulation accuracy was acceptable fig 3 a and b and that the clue s model can be used to simulate the land use change in the xiangxi river watershed it cannot be ignored that the error mainly occurred in the southwest of the watershed where the forest area was simulated as the dryland this may be caused by the relatively gentle slope in this area because the more gentle the slope is the greater the probability is that the area will be simulated as dryland in the clue s model the nse values for stream flow during calibration and validation periods were 0 69 and 0 71 and the r 2 values were 0 7 and 0 76 respectively which indicated that the simulation values of stream flow were credible fig 4 a the nse and r 2 values for orgp and minp during the calibration and validation periods were higher than 0 60 and 0 70 respectively fig 4b and c although the nse values of orgp and minp were lower than those of stream flow they were acceptable for water quality calibration and validation malagó et al 2017 the calibration and validation results of swat model indicated that this model can be used to simulate the nps pollution in the xiangxi river watershed 3 2 land use prediction in the historical trend scenario the results of land use in 2020 showed that the area of forest decreased by 2035 06 ha almost 1 percent of the forest area table 1 the area of paddy field decreased slightly by 239 87 ha areas of other land use categories increased in 2020 the area of dryland increased the most by 1549 38 ha or approximately 9 of the original area the spatial patterns of land use under historical trend scenario in 2020 indicated that the increased dryland was mainly located in the southwest of the study area which was previously covered by forest fig 3c urban area extended along the river mainly at the center of the study area in the optimized scenario the results indicated that the main change of land use was the conversion of paddy and dryland into forest table 1 the dryland area decreased by up to 3370 ha and the forest area increased by up to 3800 ha water and urban areas also increased by up to 400 ha the spatial distribution of land use showed that the dryland that became forest was mainly located in the north and southeast of the study area compared to the land use in 2010 fig 3d by comparing the land use pattern in the optimized scenario to that in the historical trend scenario it was found that the forest area increased by more than 5800 ha and that the total area of paddy and dryland decreased by more than 5700 ha the area of paddy and dryland was mainly converted into forest area however it should be noticed that although the areas of paddy and dryland decreased greatly they still satisfied the least cultivated areas goals set by the government due to the existing constraint condition set in ga spatially the change occurred mainly in the northwest and southeast of the watershed the slope in the northwest was steep with the highest slope of approximately 75 and the area was far from the towns it was not suitable for the area to maintain the dryland thus when the demand of the dryland decreased the area in the northwest changed to a more suitable land use type forest the paddy area in the east of the watershed under historical trend scenario changed to forest under the optimized scenario due to the steep slope and the long distance to the river 3 3 comparison of swat simulation results compared to 2010 the data of the total annual organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus loads showed that in historical trend scenario the watershed produced the highest nps pollution with organic and inorganic phosphorus loads up to 190 t and 700 t respectively fig 5 in optimized scenario the nps contamination was clearly controlled the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads decreased by 3 6 and 3 7 respectively compared to those in historical trend scenario the impact of the land use change on the inorganic phosphorus load was slightly more apparent than that on the organic phosphorus load this may have occurred because the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads were derived from different sources the inorganic phosphorus pollution was mainly from the fertilizer application in the study area while the organic phosphorus was derived from both the fertilizer application and livestock manure liu et al 2013b the decrease in the dryland and paddy field areas could reduce the pollution caused by fertilizer application but not that caused by livestock manure thus the decrease of the inorganic phosphorus load was larger than that of the organic phosphorus load spatially the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads were mainly derived from the southeast and northwest in the watershed fig 6 in 2010 the organic phosphorus load ranged from 0 01 t to 30 37 t among the subbasins the highest loads appeared in subbasins 11 12 16 and 19 24 the inorganic phosphorus load ranged from 0 10 t to 60 39 t among the subbasins the spatial distribution of inorganic phosphorus load was similar to the organic load but the northern area contributed more to the inorganic phosphorus load although the pollution load changes were not very evident it can be found that under the optimized scenario some subbasins produced less contamination particularly subbasins 11 16 and 19 25 fig 6d the decrease in the organic phosphorus load was less than the decrease in inorganic phosphorus in the northwest mountainous area a previous study found that the organic debris was one of the main sources of the organic phosphorus load floate 1965 forest area occupied most of the land area in the xiangxi river watershed furthermore organic phosphorus fertilizer is rarely used in the area liu et al 2017 thus the decrease in the paddy and dry land areas did not have an obvious effect on the reduction of the organic phosphorus load discharge the steeper the slope is the more serious the contamination caused by water and soil erosion will be shi et al 2012 thus a decrease in the amount of cultivated land in the mountainous areas in the northwest of the study area could effectively reduce the nps contamination huangliang shuiyuesi and xiakou were the three towns that had the largest cultivated areas and produced the highest nps pollution liu et al 2016 compared to the results in the historical trend scenario the reduction of inorganic phosphorus load in huangliang shuiyuesi and xiakou was 6 24 t 13 69 t and 1 49 t respectively in optimized scenario the reduction of organic phosphorus load in the three towns was 1 44 t 4 06 t and 0 55 t respectively the reduction of the inorganic and organic phosphorus loads in these three towns accounted for approximately 82 and 89 of the total reduction amount in the watershed therefore the decrease in the paddy and dryland areas in the three towns effectively controlled the discharge of the organic and inorganic phosphorus 3 4 support for land use planning as discussed in the previous section the ga method is better than the markov chain method for predicting the land use quantity change because it considers constraint conditions thus by using the ga method an optimized land use quantity can be determined instead of a prediction based on current change trend by markov chain to support the planning of future land use spatial patterns a plan assist map was drawn using the overlay analysis in arcgis on the land use data for 2010 and 2020 that were predicted by ga method fig 7 and the specific area change was calculated table 2 the main plan was to change from paddy and dryland to forest which is one of the most effective methods for controlling the nps pollution caused by agriculture do et al 2011 for dryland area the area in the north of the watershed which belongs to the shennongjia forestry district should be changed the most with an area up to 1201 76 ha shuiyuesi ranked second and needs to convert an area of 1115 33 ha in the southwest into forest the other towns except zhaojun also need to change more than 300 ha area of dryland into forest for paddy field shuiyuesi and huangliang need to convert 69 09 ha and 57 25 ha area into forest respectively these results indicated that shuiyuesi may not be the appropriate area for cultivation due to its geographical characteristics and social factors which were represented by 8 driving factors in this study additionally the serious soil and water erosion in the north of the watershed due to the steep slope make the area unsuitable for large area cultivation keesstra et al 2016 thus such conversions must be carried out to return the cultivation area to forest in the improper locations 4 conclusion according to the results of clue s model the area of cultivated land will increase and the area of forest will decrease in 2020 based on historical trend development however the opposite was true under the optimized plan development the change from dryland to forest occurred mainly in the northwest mountainous and southeast areas where cultivation was unsuitable but agriculture was highly developed the results indicated that the ga method has good performance for optimizing the land use quantity and that it fits well with the clue s model for predicting the spatial distribution of land use by analyzing the output of the swat model the change of organic and inorganic phosphorus loads was consistent with the change of land use the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads were mainly derived from the cultivated land the larger the area of paddy and dryland was the larger the produced contamination loads were decreasing the slope land farming area effectively reduced the nps pollution in the northwest and southeast of the study area the assistant map was drawn to support the plan of land use change in 2020 the results showed that the cultivation areas in the huangliang and shennongjia forestry district need to be converted into forest to control the nps pollution other land use categories also changed to a certain extent but were not studied here usually a land use plan is set by giving only the amount of each land use category not the spatial distribution pattern in this study by combining the clue s and swat model the spatial distribution of land use change was obtained and the change in the contamination loads was quantified to reflect the effect of the land use plan according to the results the optimized land use plan simulated by clue s using the ga land use quantity prediction method effectively reduced the nps pollution thus it can be used to support the decisions made for future land use changes acknowledgments this study was funded by the

7332,the genetic algorithm ga was combined with the conversion of land use and its effect at small regional extent clue s model to obtain an optimized land use pattern for controlling non point source nps pollution the performance of the combination was evaluated the effect of the optimized land use pattern on the nps pollution control was estimated by the soil and water assessment tool swat model and an assistant map was drawn to support the land use plan for the future the xiangxi river watershed was selected as the study area two scenarios were used to simulate the land use change under the historical trend scenario markov chain prediction the forest area decreased by 2035 06 ha and was mainly converted into paddy and dryland area in contrast under the optimized scenario genetic algorithm ga prediction up to 3370 ha of dryland area was converted into forest area spatially the conversion of paddy and dryland into forest occurred mainly in the northwest and southeast of the watershed where the slope land occupied a large proportion the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads decreased by 3 6 and 3 7 respectively in the optimized scenario compared to those in the historical trend scenario ga showed a better performance in optimized land use prediction a comparison of the land use patterns in 2010 under the real situation and in 2020 under the optimized situation showed that shennongjia and shuiyuesi should convert 1201 76 ha and 1115 33 ha of dryland into forest areas respectively which represented the greatest changes in all regions in the watershed the results of this study indicated that ga and the clue s model can be used to optimize the land use patterns in the future and that swat can be used to evaluate the effect of land use optimization on non point source pollution control these methods may provide support for land use plan of an area keywords land use change non point source pollution clue s model swat model xiangxi

an area of 3099 km2 fig 1 the river is 94 km long runs from shennongjia forestry district sn through xingshan county xs and flows into the yangtze river in xiangxi town of zigui county zg the area has

processes in many research fields such as population growth predictions and currency exchange rates cohen 2014 hu and zhu 2016 the process of land use change can be considered a markov process and predicted by markov chain fathizad et al 2015 mondal et al 2017 however it can only be used to predict the quantity of land use change not the spatial change the prediction of land use change is calculated by the following equations 1 a t 1 a t p 2 p p 11 p 12 p 1 i p 21 p 22 p 2 i p i 1 p i 2 p ii where a t and a t 1 are the land use area vectors at time t and t 1 respectively p is the matrix of land use transition probability i is the count of land use categories the calculation of p is the key point when using the markov chain method in this study the matrix of land use transition probability was calculated based on the land use area in 2000 and the area change for each land use category from 2000 to 2010 the area changes for each land use category was calculated by using the overlay analysis in arcgis between the land use maps of 2000 and 2010 the matrix was considered the historical trend of land use change and was kept invariant in the prediction process 2 2 2 genetic algorithm genetic algorithm ga which is an evolutionary algorithm was inspired by the process of biological evolution that are observed in nature such as crossover mutation and selection li and parrott 2016 ga has been widely used to generate high quality solutions to optimization and search problems nourmohammadzadeh and hartmann 2016 arikoglu 2017 kadri and boctor 2018 the procedure of ga has four parts generate initial population crossover operation mutation operation and selection in this study ga was used to predict the land use quantity change under environmental social and economic constraints the minimum total phosphorus load was set as the objective function and was calculated by the export coefficient method population size was selected as the social constraint to limit the predicted urban area within a reasonable range without this limit an excessively large area would be allocated to the urban land the constraint of basic farmland area was set to ensure the food supply gross domestic product gdp was selected as the economic constraint to maintain the balance between environmental protection and economic development in fact many factors should be controlled when optimizing the land use allocation including crop yield and ecological effects however these factors are not absolutely independent and may have the same effects on the control of land use allocation for example when gdp was set as the constraint condition the constraint of crop yield can be excluded because gdp can reflect the crop yield condition to some extent and because gdp is a more comprehensive factor than other similar factors in addition more constraints may lead to the misconvergence of the genetic algorithm thus considering both the availability of the data and the performance of the genetic algorithm only the factors mentioned above were used as constraint conditions 2 2 3 clue s model the conversion of land use and its effect at small regional extent clue s model consists of two individual modules a spatial allocation module and a demand module the demand module calculates the amount of area change for all land use types and the spatial allocation module assigns the area changes to different locations based on the raster system jiang et al 2015a for the demand module several methods can be used to calculate the area change including trend extrapolations markov model and complex economic models verburg et al 2002 zheng et al 2015 method selection depends on the data availability and accuracy requirements for the spatial allocation module the distribution of land use types is based on the probability map of the study area the calculation equation is defined as follows mas et al 2014 3 tprop i u p i u elas u iter u where tprop i u is the total probability of land use type u for grid cell i elas u is the relative elasticity for change of land use type u iter u is a variable for model iteration p i u is the probability for grid cell i to have its land use type u calculated by logistic regression as follows 4 log p i u 1 p i u β 0 β 1 x 1 i β 2 x 2 i β n x n i where the xs are the driving factors and have a direct or indirect relationship with the land use types and will affect the allocation of land use types and the β s are the coefficients corresponding to the driving factors in this study the digital elevation model dem slope aspect soil categories distance to road distance to river distance to town and population density were selected as the driving factors because they were reported to have significant effects on land use xu et al 2013 jiang et al 2015b the elasticity coefficient elas u was set according to the references and expert advice verburg et al 2002 pan et al 2010 two scenarios of land use quantity prediction were used in scenario one markov chain method was used to predict the quantity of each land use type in 2020 in this scenario land use change was assumed to obey the historical trend in scenario two the optimized land use quantity demand in 2020 was simulated by the ga method the reference information was obtained from a year book of the study area and the field research 2 2 4 swat model the physically based continuously distributed hydrological model swat soil and water assessment tool version 2012 was developed by the u s department of agriculture agriculture research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 the model is widely used to simulate the effect of management practices on hydrology condition and water quality on a watershed scale on a daily time step the water balance is calculated at the hydrological response units hrus level aggregated at the subbasin level and finally routed to the reaches and the watershed outlet grusson et al 2015 the water balance is calculated as follows 5 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil moisture content of day i sw 0 is the initial soil moisture content of day i r day is the rainfall of day i q surf is the surface runoff of day i e a is the evapotranspiration of day i w seep is the water transferred from soil profile into the gas zone of day i and q gw is the return flow of day i swat model was used to simulate the non point source pollution under different land use pattern point source pollution simulation was ignored because its amount was insignificant compared to that of non point source pollution in the study area wang et al 2012 liu et al 2013a 2 2 5 calibration and validation methods for clue s model the relative elasticity coefficient can have an obvious effect on the spatial allocation of land use types thus it is of great significance to calibrate it kappa coefficient can be used as the objective function to evaluate the simulation accuracy zhang et al 2013 the value of kappa coefficient ranges from 1 to 1 the higher the value is the more accurate the simulation is the kappa coefficient is calculated as follows 6 kappa p 0 p c p p p c where p 0 is the correct simulation proportion p c is the correct simulation proportion under random condition and p p is the correct simulation proportion under ideal conditions for the swat model swat cup was used to perform the calibration and validation procedure sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 was chosen as the calibration algorithm because it is effective when used in a large watershed rostamian et al 2008 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r 2 were used as objective functions to evaluate the performance of the swat model eqs 7 and 8 7 nse i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 o i o 2 8 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where o i is the i th observed value o is the mean value of observed values p i is the i th predicted value p is the mean value of predicted values and n is the total number of sample pairs 2 3 input data and model setup spatial information data and social statistics data were collected as input for the clue s and swat models dem data was obtained from the second version of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model dataset http www gscloud cn the average elevation of the study area is 1567 m with the lowest and highest elevations of 95 m and 3093 m respectively fig 2 a slope and aspect data were generated in arcgis based on the dem data the slope was larger in the north of the study area with the maximum slope of approximately 75 fig 2b and c a soil map 30 m resolution was obtained from the institute of geography chinese academy of sciences there are 10 kinds of soil types in the study area and limestone soil and yellow brown soil have the largest areas fig 2d land use data of 2000 and 2010 were interpreted from the landsat5 tm dataset from the website at a resolution of 30 m weather data including precipitation temperature wind relative humidity and solar radiation were collected from 9 weather stations in the watershed the spatial locations of rivers roads and towns in the study area were digitized in arcgis based on maps of zg xs and sn counties population density and land use demand in 2020 were obtained from the statistical yearbook stream flow data from 2002 to 2011 and organic and inorganic phosphorus orgp minp data from 2004 to 2011 were collected from the yichang hydrographic office the markov chain and ga methods were used to predict the land use quantity demand in 2020 the results were used as input data for the clue s land use demand module clue s was used to simulate how the land use pattern in 2010 changed from that in 2000 based on the driving factors the simulated land use in 2010 was compared with the real land use pattern in 2010 to determine whether the simulation was accurate then the land use pattern in 2020 was predicted under two different scenarios i e historical trend scenario and optimized scenario when running the swat model to simulate nps pollution calibration and validation of flow and phosphorus load were carried out first then the real land use map in 2010 and the predicted land use map in 2020 simulated by clue s were used as input data for swat to simulate the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads and their spatial distributions in the watershed in order to emphasize the effect of land use change on the nps pollution discharge the other input data and corresponding coefficients were kept invariable during the simulation by comparing the simulation results from the clue s and swat models an assistance map was drawn using overlay analysis to support the land use plan in the xiangxi river watershed in 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation a simulation of land use change from 2000 to 2010 was conducted the kappa coefficient was 0 89 showing that the simulation accuracy was acceptable fig 3 a and b and that the clue s model can be used to simulate the land use change in the xiangxi river watershed it cannot be ignored that the error mainly occurred in the southwest of the watershed where the forest area was simulated as the dryland this may be caused by the relatively gentle slope in this area because the more gentle the slope is the greater the probability is that the area will be simulated as dryland in the clue s model the nse values for stream flow during calibration and validation periods were 0 69 and 0 71 and the r 2 values were 0 7 and 0 76 respectively which indicated that the simulation values of stream flow were credible fig 4 a the nse and r 2 values for orgp and minp during the calibration and validation periods were higher than 0 60 and 0 70 respectively fig 4b and c although the nse values of orgp and minp were lower than those of stream flow they were acceptable for water quality calibration and validation malagó et al 2017 the calibration and validation results of swat model indicated that this model can be used to simulate the nps pollution in the xiangxi river watershed 3 2 land use prediction in the historical trend scenario the results of land use in 2020 showed that the area of forest decreased by 2035 06 ha almost 1 percent of the forest area table 1 the area of paddy field decreased slightly by 239 87 ha areas of other land use categories increased in 2020 the area of dryland increased the most by 1549 38 ha or approximately 9 of the original area the spatial patterns of land use under historical trend scenario in 2020 indicated that the increased dryland was mainly located in the southwest of the study area which was previously covered by forest fig 3c urban area extended along the river mainly at the center of the study area in the optimized scenario the results indicated that the main change of land use was the conversion of paddy and dryland into forest table 1 the dryland area decreased by up to 3370 ha and the forest area increased by up to 3800 ha water and urban areas also increased by up to 400 ha the spatial distribution of land use showed that the dryland that became forest was mainly located in the north and southeast of the study area compared to the land use in 2010 fig 3d by comparing the land use pattern in the optimized scenario to that in the historical trend scenario it was found that the forest area increased by more than 5800 ha and that the total area of paddy and dryland decreased by more than 5700 ha the area of paddy and dryland was mainly converted into forest area however it should be noticed that although the areas of paddy and dryland decreased greatly they still satisfied the least cultivated areas goals set by the government due to the existing constraint condition set in ga spatially the change occurred mainly in the northwest and southeast of the watershed the slope in the northwest was steep with the highest slope of approximately 75 and the area was far from the towns it was not suitable for the area to maintain the dryland thus when the demand of the dryland decreased the area in the northwest changed to a more suitable land use type forest the paddy area in the east of the watershed under historical trend scenario changed to forest under the optimized scenario due to the steep slope and the long distance to the river 3 3 comparison of swat simulation results compared to 2010 the data of the total annual organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus loads showed that in historical trend scenario the watershed produced the highest nps pollution with organic and inorganic phosphorus loads up to 190 t and 700 t respectively fig 5 in optimized scenario the nps contamination was clearly controlled the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads decreased by 3 6 and 3 7 respectively compared to those in historical trend scenario the impact of the land use change on the inorganic phosphorus load was slightly more apparent than that on the organic phosphorus load this may have occurred because the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads were derived from different sources the inorganic phosphorus pollution was mainly from the fertilizer application in the study area while the organic phosphorus was derived from both the fertilizer application and livestock manure liu et al 2013b the decrease in the dryland and paddy field areas could reduce the pollution caused by fertilizer application but not that caused by livestock manure thus the decrease of the inorganic phosphorus load was larger than that of the organic phosphorus load spatially the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads were mainly derived from the southeast and northwest in the watershed fig 6 in 2010 the organic phosphorus load ranged from 0 01 t to 30 37 t among the subbasins the highest loads appeared in subbasins 11 12 16 and 19 24 the inorganic phosphorus load ranged from 0 10 t to 60 39 t among the subbasins the spatial distribution of inorganic phosphorus load was similar to the organic load but the northern area contributed more to the inorganic phosphorus load although the pollution load changes were not very evident it can be found that under the optimized scenario some subbasins produced less contamination particularly subbasins 11 16 and 19 25 fig 6d the decrease in the organic phosphorus load was less than the decrease in inorganic phosphorus in the northwest mountainous area a previous study found that the organic debris was one of the main sources of the organic phosphorus load floate 1965 forest area occupied most of the land area in the xiangxi river watershed furthermore organic phosphorus fertilizer is rarely used in the area liu et al 2017 thus the decrease in the paddy and dry land areas did not have an obvious effect on the reduction of the organic phosphorus load discharge the steeper the slope is the more serious the contamination caused by water and soil erosion will be shi et al 2012 thus a decrease in the amount of cultivated land in the mountainous areas in the northwest of the study area could effectively reduce the nps contamination huangliang shuiyuesi and xiakou were the three towns that had the largest cultivated areas and produced the highest nps pollution liu et al 2016 compared to the results in the historical trend scenario the reduction of inorganic phosphorus load in huangliang shuiyuesi and xiakou was 6 24 t 13 69 t and 1 49 t respectively in optimized scenario the reduction of organic phosphorus load in the three towns was 1 44 t 4 06 t and 0 55 t respectively the reduction of the inorganic and organic phosphorus loads in these three towns accounted for approximately 82 and 89 of the total reduction amount in the watershed therefore the decrease in the paddy and dryland areas in the three towns effectively controlled the discharge of the organic and inorganic phosphorus 3 4 support for land use planning as discussed in the previous section the ga method is better than the markov chain method for predicting the land use quantity change because it considers constraint conditions thus by using the ga method an optimized land use quantity can be determined instead of a prediction based on current change trend by markov chain to support the planning of future land use spatial patterns a plan assist map was drawn using the overlay analysis in arcgis on the land use data for 2010 and 2020 that were predicted by ga method fig 7 and the specific area change was calculated table 2 the main plan was to change from paddy and dryland to forest which is one of the most effective methods for controlling the nps pollution caused by agriculture do et al 2011 for dryland area the area in the north of the watershed which belongs to the shennongjia forestry district should be changed the most with an area up to 1201 76 ha shuiyuesi ranked second and needs to convert an area of 1115 33 ha in the southwest into forest the other towns except zhaojun also need to change more than 300 ha area of dryland into forest for paddy field shuiyuesi and huangliang need to convert 69 09 ha and 57 25 ha area into forest respectively these results indicated that shuiyuesi may not be the appropriate area for cultivation due to its geographical characteristics and social factors which were represented by 8 driving factors in this study additionally the serious soil and water erosion in the north of the watershed due to the steep slope make the area unsuitable for large area cultivation keesstra et al 2016 thus such conversions must be carried out to return the cultivation area to forest in the improper locations 4 conclusion according to the results of clue s model the area of cultivated land will increase and the area of forest will decrease in 2020 based on historical trend development however the opposite was true under the optimized plan development the change from dryland to forest occurred mainly in the northwest mountainous and southeast areas where cultivation was unsuitable but agriculture was highly developed the results indicated that the ga method has good performance for optimizing the land use quantity and that it fits well with the clue s model for predicting the spatial distribution of land use by analyzing the output of the swat model the change of organic and inorganic phosphorus loads was consistent with the change of land use the organic and inorganic phosphorus loads were mainly derived from the cultivated land the larger the area of paddy and dryland was the larger the produced contamination loads were decreasing the slope land farming area effectively reduced the nps pollution in the northwest and southeast of the study area the assistant map was drawn to support the plan of land use change in 2020 the results showed that the cultivation areas in the huangliang and shennongjia forestry district need to be converted into forest to control the nps pollution other land use categories also changed to a certain extent but were not studied here usually a land use plan is set by giving only the amount of each land use category not the spatial distribution pattern in this study by combining the clue s and swat model the spatial distribution of land use change was obtained and the change in the contamination loads was quantified to reflect the effect of the land use plan according to the results the optimized land use plan simulated by clue s using the ga land use quantity prediction method effectively reduced the nps pollution thus it can be used to support the decisions made for future land use changes acknowledgments this study was funded by the

7333,mobile immobile transport models can be effective in reproducing heavily tailed breakthrough curves of concentration however such models may not adequately describe transport along multiple flow paths with intermediate velocity contrasts in connected fields we propose using the mobile mobile model for simulating subsurface flow and associated mixing controlled reactive transport in connected fields this model includes two local concentrations one in the fast and the other in the slow flow domain which predict both the concentration mean and variance the normalized total concentration variance within the flux is found to be a non monotonic function of the discharge ratio with a maximum concentration variance at intermediate values of the discharge ratio we test the mobile mobile model for mixing controlled reactive transport with an instantaneous irreversible bimolecular reaction in structured and connected random heterogeneous domains and compare the performance of the mobile mobile to the mobile immobile model the results indicate that the mobile mobile model generally predicts the concentration breakthrough curves btcs of the reactive compound better particularly for cases of an elliptical inclusion with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrasts where the travel time distribution shows bimodal behavior the prediction of both the btcs and maximum product concentration is significantly improved our results exemplify that the conceptual model of two mobile domains with diffusive mass transfer in between is in general good for predicting mixing controlled reactive transport and particularly so in cases where the transfer in the low conductivity zones is by slow advection rather than diffusion keywords mobile mobile mobile immobile mixing reactive transport 1 introduction concentration breakthrough curves btcs measured in heterogeneous porous media often exhibit anomalous behavior such as multiple peaks and enhanced tails berkowitz et al 2000 edery et al 2014 this can be caused by preferential flow paths which contribute marginally to the overall void space but dominantly to the mass flux and slow release of dissolved constituents from predominant stagnant zones in heterogeneous media zheng and gorelick 2003 zinn et al 2004 advection dispersion mass transfer admt models or mobile immobile models have been widely used to describe anomalous transport in heterogeneous porous media liu et al 2007 willmann et al 2008 tyukhova and willmann 2016 classical mobile immobile models with kinetic mass transfer include the first order model e g coats and smith 1964 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 slab cylindrical and spherical diffusive models e g crank 1975 multirate mass transfer models haggerty and gorelick 1995 and the double diffusion model cunningham et al 1997 all focusing on the conceptualization of matrix block geometries other advanced models include continuous time random walk berkowitz et al 2006 and fractal dispersion models benson et al 2000 mobile immobile models with different conceptualizations of the immobile domain are particularly effective in reproducing heavily tailed breakthrough curves by choosing appropriate memory functions haggerty et al 2000 schumer et al 2003 however mobile immobile models adopting only a single permeable region may not adequately describe advection in multiple flow paths in connected fields which is the primary solute transport process zinn et al 2004 leij et al 2012 both laboratory and field experiments have demonstrated that the mesoscale features may embody substantial water flow and delineate structured subsurface media into multiple flow paths with intermediate permeability and velocity contrasts which may not be sufficiently characterized by models with a single permeable region luxmoore et al 1990 jardine et al 1990 jury and fluhler 1992 zinn et al 2004 leij et al 2012 more importantly such models may yield erroneous prediction for reactive transport because they neglect the concentration differences among different flow paths kapoor et al 1997 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 fiorotto and caroni 2002 2003 bellin and tonina 2007 oates 2007 cirpka et al 2008 luo et al 2008 chiogna and bellin 2013 in weakly or highly heterogeneous media mobile immobile models demonstrated good prediction for mixing controlled reactive transport with low concentration variances edery et al 2009 willmann et al 2010 however in media with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrast such models yield significant errors luo and cirpka 2011 the decisive point is that they conceptualize a single concentration within the solute flux in the mobile domain and slow advection effects are completely considered as a part of kinetic mass transfer in the immobile domain guswa and freyberg 2000 zinn et al 2003 thus they cannot account for reaction rate variations caused by concentration fluctuations within the flux kapoor et al 1997 gramling et al 2002 dentz et al 2010 many approaches have been developed to simulate such reactive transport with non negligible effects of incomplete mixing or concentration variations e g kapoor et al 1997 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 oates 2007 luo and cirpka 2008 sanchez vila et al 2010 chiogna and bellin 2013 bolster et al 2016 ginn 2018 in this study we use a mobile mobile transport model to upscale reactive transport in connected heterogeneous media the model considers advective dispersive transport in two continua with different velocity and an exchange term between the two continua this concept is also known as dual permeability model in contrast to dual porosity model as synonym for the mobile immobile model or as dual continuum model and has been used to simulate flow and transport in unsaturated zones structured soils and fractured karstified aquifers dykhuizen 1987 gerke and van genuchten 1993 mean concentrations can be achieved by flux or volume weighted averaging of the concentrations in the two domains whereas mobile immobile models can only provide volume averages by construction the model involves a variance of both the residence and flux concentration thus the mobile mobile model is possible to quantify concentration variances involved in flux based concentration btcs in addition the model is set in an eulerian framework which is convenient when incorporating complex reaction models for conservative transport analytical and approximate analytical solutions have been reported leij et al 2012 scioritno et al 2015 we aim to demonstrate that including one more flow domain is an appropriate parametrization to simulate reactive transport in connected fields with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrast and multiple flow paths we will particularly show the improvement of the mobile mobile model compared with mobile immobile models with a single mobile domain to quantify both concentration mean and variance for reactive transport in such fields this paper is organized as follows section 2 recapitulates the governing equations of the mobile mobile transport model and its dimensional analysis section 3 discusses the effects of various processes on the concentration variances within the flux and its effects on reactive transport section 4 presents the application of the mobile mobile transport model for simulating an instantaneous bimolecular reactive transport in connected structured and heterogeneous fields and compare its performance with a mobile immobile model finally in section 5 we draw conclusions 2 mobile mobile transport model 2 1 governing equations the subsurface medium is conceptualized as two overlapping domains with different flow velocities and dispersion coefficients and a linear kinetic mass transfer term between the transport governing equations for a conservative tracer are given by dykhuizen 1987 gerke and van genuchten 1993 leij et al 2012 1 θ f c f t q f c f x θ f d f 2 c f x 2 α c s c f θ s c s t q s c s x θ s d s 2 c

respectively q f and q s are specific discharges d f and d s are dispersion coefficients and α is the first order mass transfer rate coefficient all parameters are assumed constant more complex e g nonlocal laws for the exchange between the two domains could be defined if deemed necessary but they would require additional parameters by neglecting molecular diffusion and assuming the same dispersivity d f and d s are written as 2 d f α l v f d s α l v s in which α l is the apparent longitudinal dispersivity and v f and v s are fast and slow velocities here the same longitudinal dispersivity is assumed to have fewer unknown parameters leij et al 2012 presented an analytical solution of concentrations to eqs 1 and 2 with a first type step input boundary condition the mobile mobile model is more general than classical advection dispersion equations ade and mobile immobile models under the following conditions the mobile mobile model can be simplified to 1 if the slow velocity is much smaller than the fast velocity the slow flow domain may be considered as immobile so that the mobile mobile model becomes a mobile immobile model 2 if the porosity of the slow flow domain is negligible it becomes the standard ade model 3 if the mass transfer is very fast the concentrations in the slow and fast flow domains approach equilibrium and the mobile mobile model becomes a simple ade model 4 if the mass transfer is very slow and negligible the mobile mobile model becomes the superposition of two ade models which represents advective dispersive transport in two non interacting stream tubes it is straightforward to extend the mobile mobile model to reactive transport by incorporating reaction kinetics in the fast and slow domains 3 θ f c f i t q f c f i x θ f d f

in the fast and slow flow domains and r f i and r s i are the corresponding reaction rates reactions are treated separately in these two domains and mass exchange occurs through kinetic mass transfer one may also account for equilibrium or kinetic sorption by including additional solid phases in both domains 2 2 dimensionless parameters to derive the dimensionless form of the mobile mobile model we introduce ratios of porosity and discharge 4 β θ f θ s η q f q s in which β is the porosity ratio and η is the discharge ratio which may be interpreted as the hydraulic conductivity or permeability contrast between the fast and slow flow domains given the same hydraulic gradient in terms of the total flow discharge q q f q s and total porosity θ θ f θ s we introduce normalized parameters 5

into the time domain which is done most easily by numerical methods de hoog et al 1982 leij et al 2012 also provided the integral solution 2 4 mean concentration and variance the mobile mobile model considers that the flux averaged breakthrough curve is the mixture of solutions in the two domains thus the flux weighted concentration is given by 12 c m η 1 η c f 1 1 η c s the concentration variance within the flux is given by 13 σ c 2 η 1 η 2 c f c s 2 the mean concentration and variance may also be defined for the residence concentration by the porosities as weights unlike other models involving the evaluation of concentration variations or distributions the mobile mobile model can be conveniently solved by numerically inverting the laplace solution or integral methods leij et al 2012 in addition if concentration variances are available one may jointly fit the flux weighted mean and variance to estimate the transport parameters we shall notice that the mobile mobile model yields two concentrations at each time and location which essentially uses a binary distribution to approximate the actual concentration distribution however the mobile mobile model aims to approximate the concentration variance instead of evaluating the concentration distribution 3 behavior of concentration variance within the flux as we indicate in the introduction the mobile mobile model provides two concentrations that contribute to the flow flux while mobile immobile models only provides one concentration to the flow thus the mobile mobile model can quantify concentration variances and reaction rate variations but mobile immobile models cannot because the immobile concentration is not counted in the flow flux regardless how the immobile domain is conceptualized in the following we will focus on the concentration variance within the flux for a step input at the inlet representing a displacement scenario of the injected solution replacing the resident solution the concentration breakthrough curves are simply the time integrals of the solutions presented in the previous section the normalized root mean concentration variance nrmcv is used to quantify the concentration variance within the flux ris et al 1999 luo and cirpka 2011 14 nrmcv σ c 2 dt c max c min in which c max 1 and c min 0 for a step input the concentration variance within the flux at a given location x 1 for the outlet is controlled by the dimensionless parameters β η p e and d a in which β and η mainly control the flow velocity and discharge contrast whereas p e and d a describe the mixing effects 3 1 effects of flow contrast fig 1 shows the effects of the porosity ratio and discharge contrast or hydraulic conductivity contrast for given constant mixing parameters p e and d a and porosity ratio β the concentration variance within the flux is a non monotonic function of the discharge contrast η fig 1a the maximum concentration variance occurs at an intermediate value of η this observation is consistent to the findings of luo and cirpka 2011 macroscopic mean models that perfectly fit flux averaged conservative concentration btcs may not improve the prediction of mixing controlled reactive transport in cases with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrast because it is necessary to quantify and account for the variability of reaction rates caused by variations of concentrations in the flux luo and cirpka 2011 in high contrast cases most flow takes place in the fast flow paths which results in a small variance of the flux weighted concentration even though the offset in the breakthrough between the slow and fast travel paths is substantial fig 1b shows that the concentration variance monotonically decreases with the porosity ratio for given discharge contrast since the discharge contrast is related to the ratio of specific discharge an increase in the ratio of porosities implies a decrease in the ratio of effective velocity thus reducing the concentration variance fig 2 shows btcs of concentrations in both mobile domains the flux weighted average and the associated concentration variance the total concentration variance expressed by the nrmcv according to eq 22 depends on the magnitude of the concentration difference between the two domains and the duration over which the two concentrations significantly differ at a smaller contrast in discharge and velocity fig 2a the peak values of the concentration variance magnitude are larger but the duration of large concentration variance is shorter at a larger contrast in discharge and velocity fig 2c the mean btc has a long tail because of the slow flow but the mean value is dominated by the concentration in the fast flow resulting in a small concentration variance at an intermediate contrast in discharge fig 2b the integral effects of both variance magnitude and duration result in a large value of the total concentration variance nrmcv 3 2 effects of longitudinal dispersion and exchange between the domains fig 3 shows the effects of longitudinal dispersion and first order mass transfer on the total concentration variance nrmcv fig 3a shows that the nrmcv increases with the péclet number which implies that a smaller dispersivity or a longer travel distance yields a higher normalized concentration variance fig 3b shows that a higher damköhler number e g a larger first order mass transfer rate coefficient yields a smaller total concentration variance nrmcv because mass transfer between the fast and slow domains diminishes concentration differences between the two domains at the limit of very large d a values the kinetic mass transfer instantaneously reaches equilibrium resulting in identical concentrations in the two domains and thus zero concentration variance for small d a values the mobile mobile model approaches the limit of two non interacting stream tubes fig 3 essentially implies that larger mixing effects in both longitudinal and transverse directions yield smaller concentration variances within the flux however there is a fundamental difference between the cases with zero and non zero d a numbers fig 4 presents the effects of decreasing first order mass transfer on the concentration variance within the mobile mobile model kinetic mass transfer is the only mechanism that causes mixing between the fast and slow domains functioning similarly to transverse dispersion in continuous models with the decrease of d a the magnitude of the total concentration variance nrmcv increases comparing figs 3a with 4a while the non monotonic dependence on the discharge contrast remains if the exchange between the two domains is suppressed altogether d a 0 by contrast the dependence on the discharge contrast becomes monotonically increasing fig 4b the appendix contains the analytical proof for the monotonic behavior of the non interacting case these results are similar to transport in perfectly stratified aquifers with or without transverse dispersion across layers 4 numerical experiments of reactive transport in this section we use two specific numerical cases to demonstrate the applications of the mobile mobile model in simulating reactive transport in connected fields where multiple mobile domains are needed to account for concentration variations within the flow flux for reactive transport one numerical case is reactive transport in a two dimensional structured medium with different hydraulic conductivity contrasts and the other is two dimensional randomly heterogeneous fields with different hydraulic conductivity variances all cases are first solved numerically luo and cirpka 2011 to evaluate the full spatial temporal distribution of concentrations within the outflow which serve as the true cases in the field thus both mean concentrations and concentration variances can be evaluated based on the local scale outflow btcs in practice such detailed information would not be available thus we consider the most practical cases in which the only known information is the measured flux weighted btc of a conservative tracer at the domain outlet we then develop one dimensional mobile mobile and mobile immobile models to upscale the transport in the unknown two dimensional fields using the measured btcs finally the upscaled models are used to predict reactive transport and compare with the true cases the same procedure is applied to develop the mobile mobile model and the mobile immobile model model transport parameters including porosities discharge rates dispersivity and mass transfer rate coefficient are estimated by fitting model predicted flux weighted btcs of conservative tracers to those obtained in two dimensional cases reaction kinetics are then included in the transport model to predict btcs of reactive species in comparison to the mobile immobile model there is only one more parameter to be estimated for the mobile mobile model namely the velocity in the slow flow domain or the discharge contrast fore reactive transport we consider a replacement scenario with compounds undergoing an instantaneous irreversible bimolecular reaction with 1 1 1 stoichiometry a b c in which a b and c are aqueous species solutes species b is initially present throughout the domain and a is injected at the inflow boundary concentrations of a b and c can be solved using the mixing ratio approach based on btcs of a conservative compound de simoni et al 2005 2007 cirpka and valocchi 2007 an entropy based critical reaction time was also presented for such a mixing controlled reactive transport chiogna and rolle 2017 we quantitatively compare the performance of the mobile mobile and mobile immobile model by computing the root mean squared deviation rmsd between the numerically simulated concentration btcs two dimensional true cases and model predicted btcs 15 rmsd i 1 n c model c numerical 2 n p where c model and c numerical are concentrations predicted by models and numerical experiments respectively and p is the number of unknown parameters in addition the relative deviation of the peak concentration of species c is defined for quantifying the performance in reactive transport 16 ε p c max mm c max c max mim c max where c max mm c max mim and c max are the maximum concentrations predicted by the mobile mobile mobile immobile and fully resolved numerical experiments respectively models are more accurate when the rmsd and ε p decrease 4 1 low permeability inclusion in the first application we consider a single elliptical low permeability inclusion embedded in a rectangular two dimensional homogeneous isotropic domain fig 5 a composition of many low or high permeable inclusions may form structured or unstructured heterogeneous fields zinn and harvey 2003 suribhatla et al 2004 the hydraulic head is fixed at the left and right boundaries whereas no flow crosses the top and bottom boundaries the major and minor axes of the ellipse are half of the domain length and width respectively table 1 summarizes the hydraulic parameters used in the numerical case luo and cirpka 2011 solute transport in this domain is essentially controlled by the following two dimensionless parameters 17 k r k 1 k 2 pe v b 2 d t l in which k 1 and k 2 are the hydraulic conductivity in the exterior and interior regions of the inclusion respectively k r represents the hydraulic conductivity contrast v is the effective mean velocity within the entire domain b is the half width of the elliptical inclusion l is the domain length d t is the transverse dispersion coefficient and pe is the transverse péclet number fig 5 shows the concentration distributions at 0 5 pv a1 c1 the mean concentration btcs of a conservative tracer in the outflow a2 c2 the travel time distributions in the domain a3 c3 and the associated variance of the flux concentration in the outflow a4 c4 for three cases with different hydraulic conductivity contrast and similarly large péclet numbers pe 400 in all three cases a fraction of the total flux passes through the low conductivity inclusion while the remaining flux surpasses the inclusion a1 c1 the larger k r the less flux passes through the inclusion and the more flux surpasses the inclusion which results in a faster breakthrough time at the outflow and longer tailing of the mean btc in the outflow a2 c2 local btcs measured in each small elements at the outflow boundary are crowded in the case of k r 1 8 and more dispersed in the other two cases a2 c2 obvious bimodal behavior is observed in the travel time distribution for k r 1 8 a3 but is not observable for k r 10 b3 and k r 100 c3 because only in the case of a smaller conductivity contrast a substantial fraction of the flow passes through the inclusion resulting in two peaks after superimposing all local travel time distributions the variability in concentration a4 c4 results mainly from different times and shapes of local breakthrough between stream tubes passing through the low permeability inclusion and those bypassing it the variance peak decreases with the conductivity contrast because the variance within the flux is dominated by the fast flow luo and cirpka 2011 the case with larger conductivity contrast shows a significantly enhanced tail after the first peak in both mean concentration and concentration variance fig 5 also shows the model fits of the mobile mobile and mobile immobile models fitted dimensionless parameters are provided in the supplementary material both models provide a good prediction for the outflow btcs of a conservative tracer for a step injection at the inflow boundary a2 c2 for the travel time distributions which correspond to an impulse tracer injection in the inflow the mobile mobile model yields a better fit than the mobile immobile model a3 c3 particularly for the case with k r 1 8 where the bimodal behavior is characterized by the mobile mobile model but not by the mobile immobile model the rmsd summarized in table 2 shows that the mobile mobile model preforms better than the mobile immobile model in all cases and their performance becomes similar for high conductivity contrasts however mobile immobile models cannot describe the concentration variances in the flux because only a single concentration can be predicted with the btc fitting the mobile mobile model predicts the concentration variance a4 c4 particularly well for the cases with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrasts k r 1 8 and 10 for the high contrast case k r 100 the mobile mobile model reproduces the long tail of the concentration variance but misses the peak fig 6 shows the model prediction for reactive transport with a bimolecular instantaneous reaction although both models fit the btcs of the mean conservative tracer concentration well fig 5 a2 c2 the mobile mobile model predicts the btcs of reactive species concentrations much better than the mobile immobile model particularly for k r 1 8 and 10 reflecting that the mobile mobile model involves the segregation of the solute flux into two distinct zones with different velocity fig 5 a4 c4 the rmsd of the reactive btcs and the relative deviation in the peak concentration of species c table 2 significantly decreases when switching from the mobile immobile to the mobile mobile model in all reactive transport cases considered these cases demonstrate that while it may not be necessary to consider flow segregation if the mean concentration of a conservative compound is of interest this process may be important for reactive transport controlled by longitudinal mixing particularly for media with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrasts where the concentration variations in the flux are important shown by the local btcs of all species 4 2 connected random heterogeneous fields the second set of simulations are performed in two dimensional connected random heterogeneous fields fig 7 a and d which are generated by absolute value transformation of multi gaussian fields with subsequent rescaling zinn and harvey 2003 gong et al 2013 presented how the spatial correlation of the transformed field can be derived from that of the original field we assume gaussian covariance models for the original multi gaussian fields and variances of log hydraulic conductivity of 1 and 6 to represent mildly and strongly heterogeneous fields all hydrogeological parameters are listed in table 3 the mean flow is oriented in the x direction transport is solved on a streamline oriented grid with grid resolution identical to that of the rectangular grid using the streamline method of cirpka et al 1999a b the streamlines are rather uniformly distributed in the case of a small log conductivity variance fig 7b whereas they are strongly focused in the zones with large hydraulic conductivities forming narrow preferential paths in the strongly heterogeneous case fig 7e the largest fraction of flow is restricted to these preferential paths causing much earlier breakthrough figs 7f and 8 d than in the mildly heterogeneous case figs 7c and 8a fig 8 shows the model fit of the mean btcs of a conservative tracer the travel time distributions and the variance in the high variance case the local btcs vary more strongly resulting in earlier breakthrough and longer tailing of the mean btc fig 8a and d no obvious bimodal behavior is observed in the random heterogeneous fields because the local travel times cover the full range of breakthrough times which differs from the case of the single low permeability inclusion where local breakthrough times were clustered in two peaks fig 5 a3 the concentration variance decreases with increasing variance of the log conductivity because the fraction of flow outside of the preferential flow paths decreases also transverse mixing within the preferential flow zones is enhanced by the short transverse mixing lengths thus the concentration variation in highly heterogeneous fields may be smaller than in mildly heterogeneous fields both mobile mobile and mobile immobile models fit the btcs of a conservative tracer in the outflow quite well the mobile mobile model yields a good prediction of the concentration variance in the case with low variance of log conductivity and underestimates the concentration variance in the highly heterogeneous case while the mobile immobile model does not predict any variance of the flux concentration fig 9 shows the predictions of reactive transport with a bimolecular instantaneous reaction in the connected random heterogeneous media in general the mobile mobile model yields better predictions than the mobile immobile model with increasing variance of log hydraulic conductivity the predictions by the two models become more similar because the majority of flow occurs in preferential paths which dominate the evaluation of the flux averaged concentration and make it unnecessary to consider flow segregation thus models with a single mobile domain perform better in highly than in mildly heterogeneous cases the rmsd and peak deviation summarized in table 2 also show that the mobile mobile model yields a better prediction in terms of both the btcs and the peak concentration of product c we want to remark that the mobile immobile predictions using connected random fields are better than in the cases with a single inclusion because the domain size is larger than 30 integral scales and the prediction error decreases with increasing travel distance which is consistent with the common understanding that mixing can catch up with spreading in the large distance limit 5 conclusions mobile immobile models with one mobile concentration are incapable of representing multiple flow paths with intermediate velocity contrasts incomplete mixing and thus concentration variations within the solute flux this has been identified as the major mechanism responsible for inaccurate predictions of reactive transport controlled by longitudinal mixing e g kapoor et al 1997 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 such models work well only when the concentration variations within the flux are small or when the reaction is linear because the transfer from conservative components to reactive species concentrations is usually nonlinear it is clear that neglecting non negligible variations may lead to a mass balance error thus it is generally necessary to consider concentration variations in the upscaling of mixing controlled reactive transport in the present study we propose adopting the mobile mobile model for such purposes because the mobile mobile model gives two local flux concentrations one in the fast and the other in the slow flow domain it conveniently predicts both the mean and variance of the flux concentration the concentration variance within the flux is controlled by four dimensionless parameters namely the porosity and discharge ratios the péclet number and the damköhler number the normalized total concentration variance decreases with the increase of the porosity ratio and the damköhler number and with the decrease of the péclet number while it changes non monotonically with the discharge ratio the maximum concentration variance occurs at intermediate discharge contrasts we have numerically tested the mobile mobile model for an instantaneous irreversible bimolecular reaction in domains with a single low permeability inclusion and in connected random heterogeneous media the instantaneous reaction considered here poses the limiting case of mixing controlled reactive transport reaction kinetics generally would lead to less importance of mixing cirpka et al 2008 leading to a better performance of both mobile mobile and mobile immobile transport models compared to each other in the present study the case of a single inclusion could be characterized by two dimensionless variables the hydraulic conductivity contrast and the transverse péclet number in the simulations using random fields the hydraulic conductivity contrast was replaced by the variance of log conductivity our results indicate that both mobile mobile and mobile immobile models describe the mean btcs of conservative compounds in the outflow well however the mobile mobile model generally better predicts btcs of the reactive compounds in both the single inclusion and random heterogeneous media particularly in the cases of elliptical inclusions with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrast where bimodal behavior is shown in the travel time distribution the improvement of the mobile mobile model is significant for the case with a long concentration tail the mobile mobile model performed well with respect to the tails but the peak difference was not well captured if conservative concentration btcs can be well characterized by macroscopic models with a single flux concentration such as the classical ade and mobile immobile models the fitted mobile mobile model usually approaches these macroscopic models in such cases the mobile mobile model performs the same way as the single flux domain models insufficiently quantifying the concentration variance and yielding similar predictions of concentration btcs of reactive species for mixing controlled reactive transport in general however the mobile mobile model provides two concentrations that contribute to the flux and can be used to evaluate concentration variance yielding the chance of better predicting mixing controlled reactive transport than macroscopic models with a single flux concentration under which conditions flux averaged btcs of conservative compounds are sufficient to unanimously identify multiple flux domains is an important question but beyond the scope of the current study in the supplementary material we provides some preliminary results for the performance improvement of the mobile mobile model in randomly heterogeneous media based on numerical simulations of multiple realizations acknowledgement the authors thank the constructive comments from three anonymous reviewers c

7333,mobile immobile transport models can be effective in reproducing heavily tailed breakthrough curves of concentration however such models may not adequately describe transport along multiple flow paths with intermediate velocity contrasts in connected fields we propose using the mobile mobile model for simulating subsurface flow and associated mixing controlled reactive transport in connected fields this model includes two local concentrations one in the fast and the other in the slow flow domain which predict both the concentration mean and variance the normalized total concentration variance within the flux is found to be a non monotonic function of the discharge ratio with a maximum concentration variance at intermediate values of the discharge ratio we test the mobile mobile model for mixing controlled reactive transport with an instantaneous irreversible bimolecular reaction in structured and connected random heterogeneous domains and compare the performance of the mobile mobile to the mobile immobile model the results indicate that the mobile mobile model generally predicts the concentration breakthrough curves btcs of the reactive compound better particularly for cases of an elliptical inclusion with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrasts where the travel time distribution shows bimodal behavior the prediction of both the btcs and maximum product concentration is significantly improved our results exemplify that the conceptual model of two mobile domains with diffusive mass transfer in between is in general good for predicting mixing controlled reactive transport and particularly so in cases where the transfer in the low conductivity zones is by slow advection rather than diffusion keywords mobile mobile mobile immobile mixing reactive transport 1 introduction concentration breakthrough curves btcs measured in heterogeneous porous media often exhibit anomalous behavior such as multiple peaks and enhanced tails berkowitz et al 2000 edery et al 2014 this can be caused by preferential flow paths which contribute marginally to the overall void space but dominantly to the mass flux and slow release of dissolved constituents from predominant stagnant zones in heterogeneous media zheng and gorelick 2003 zinn et al 2004 advection dispersion mass transfer admt models or mobile immobile models have been widely used to describe anomalous transport in heterogeneous porous media liu et al 2007 willmann et al 2008 tyukhova and willmann 2016 classical mobile immobile models with kinetic mass transfer include the first order model e g coats and smith 1964 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 slab cylindrical and spherical diffusive models e g crank 1975 multirate mass transfer models haggerty and gorelick 1995 and the double diffusion model cunningham et al 1997 all focusing on the conceptualization of matrix block geometries other advanced models include continuous time random walk berkowitz et al 2006 and fractal dispersion models benson et al 2000 mobile immobile models with different conceptualizations of the immobile domain are particularly effective in reproducing heavily tailed breakthrough curves by choosing appropriate memory functions haggerty et al 2000 schumer et al 2003 however mobile immobile models adopting only a single permeable region may not adequately describe advection in multiple flow paths in connected fields which is the primary solute transport process zinn et al 2004 leij et al 2012 both laboratory and field experiments have demonstrated that the mesoscale features may embody substantial water flow and delineate structured subsurface media into multiple flow paths with intermediate permeability and velocity contrasts which may not be sufficiently characterized by models with a single permeable region luxmoore et al 1990 jardine et al 1990 jury and fluhler 1992 zinn et al 2004 leij et al 2012 more importantly such models may yield erroneous prediction for reactive transport because they neglect the concentration differences among different flow paths kapoor et al 1997 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 fiorotto and caroni 2002 2003 bellin and tonina 2007 oates 2007 cirpka et al 2008 luo et al 2008 chiogna and bellin 2013 in weakly or highly heterogeneous media mobile immobile models demonstrated good prediction for mixing controlled reactive transport with low concentration variances edery et al 2009 willmann et al 2010 however in media with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrast such models yield significant errors luo and cirpka 2011 the decisive point is that they conceptualize a single concentration within the solute flux in the mobile domain and slow advection effects are completely considered as a part of kinetic mass transfer in the immobile domain guswa and freyberg 2000 zinn et al 2003 thus they cannot account for reaction rate variations caused by concentration fluctuations within the flux kapoor et al 1997 gramling et al 2002 dentz et al 2010 many approaches have been developed to simulate such reactive transport with non negligible effects of incomplete mixing or concentration variations e g kapoor et al 1997 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 oates 2007 luo and cirpka 2008 sanchez vila et al 2010 chiogna and bellin 2013 bolster et al 2016 ginn 2018 in this study we use a mobile mobile transport model to upscale reactive transport in connected heterogeneous media the model considers advective dispersive transport in two continua with different velocity and an exchange term between the two continua this concept is also known as dual permeability model in contrast to dual porosity model as synonym for the mobile immobile model or as dual continuum model and has been used to simulate flow and transport in unsaturated zones structured soils and fractured karstified aquifers dykhuizen 1987 gerke and van genuchten 1993 mean concentrations can be achieved by flux or volume weighted averaging of the concentrations in the two domains whereas mobile immobile models can only provide volume averages by construction the model involves a variance of both the residence and flux concentration thus the mobile mobile model is possible to quantify concentration variances involved in flux based concentration btcs in addition the model is set in an eulerian framework which is convenient when incorporating complex reaction models for conservative transport analytical and approximate analytical solutions have been reported leij et al 2012 scioritno et al 2015 we aim to demonstrate that including one more flow domain is an appropriate parametrization to simulate reactive transport in connected fields with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrast and multiple flow paths we will particularly show the improvement of the mobile mobile model compared with mobile immobile models with a single mobile domain to quantify both concentration mean and variance for reactive transport in such fields this paper is organized as follows section 2 recapitulates the governing equations of the mobile mobile transport model and its dimensional analysis section 3 discusses the effects of various processes on the concentration variances within the flux and its effects on reactive transport section 4 presents the application of the mobile mobile transport model for simulating an instantaneous bimolecular reactive transport in connected structured and heterogeneous fields and compare its performance with a mobile immobile model finally in section 5 we draw conclusions 2 mobile mobile transport model 2 1 governing equations the subsurface medium is conceptualized as two overlapping domains with different flow velocities and dispersion coefficients and a linear kinetic mass transfer term between the transport governing equations for a conservative tracer are given by dykhuizen 1987 gerke and van genuchten 1993 leij et al 2012 1 θ f c f t q f c f x θ f d f 2 c f x 2 α c s c f θ s c s t q s c s x θ s d s 2 c

respectively q f and q s are specific discharges d f and d s are dispersion coefficients and α is the first order mass transfer rate coefficient all parameters are assumed constant more complex e g nonlocal laws for the exchange between the two domains could be defined if deemed necessary but they would require additional parameters by neglecting molecular diffusion and assuming the same dispersivity d f and d s are written as 2 d f α l v f d s α l v s in which α l is the apparent longitudinal dispersivity and v f and v s are fast and slow velocities here the same longitudinal dispersivity is assumed to have fewer unknown parameters leij et al 2012 presented an analytical solution of concentrations to eqs 1 and 2 with a first type step input boundary condition the mobile mobile model is more general than classical advection dispersion equations ade and mobile immobile models under the following conditions the mobile mobile model can be simplified to 1 if the slow velocity is much smaller than the fast velocity the slow flow domain may be considered as immobile so that the mobile mobile model becomes a mobile immobile model 2 if the porosity of the slow flow domain is negligible it becomes the standard ade model 3 if the mass transfer is very fast the concentrations in the slow and fast flow domains approach equilibrium and the mobile mobile model becomes a simple ade model 4 if the mass transfer is very slow and negligible the mobile mobile model becomes the superposition of two ade models which represents advective dispersive transport in two non interacting stream tubes it is straightforward to extend the mobile mobile model to reactive transport by incorporating reaction kinetics in the fast and slow domains 3 θ f c f i t q f c f i x θ f d f

one may also account for equilibrium or kinetic sorption by including additional solid phases in both domains 2 2 dimensionless parameters to derive the dimensionless form of the mobile mobile model

into the time domain which is done most easily by numerical methods de hoog et al 1982 leij et al 2012 also provided the integral solution 2 4 mean concentration and variance the mobile mobile model considers that the flux averaged breakthrough curve is the mixture of solutions in the two domains thus the flux weighted concentration is given by 12 c m η 1 η c f 1 1 η c s the concentration variance within the flux is given by 13 σ c 2 η 1 η 2 c f c s 2 the mean concentration and variance may also be defined for the residence concentration by the porosities as weights unlike other models involving the evaluation of concentration variations or distributions the mobile mobile model can be conveniently solved by numerically inverting the laplace solution or integral methods leij et al 2012 in addition if concentration variances are available one may jointly fit the flux weighted mean and variance to estimate the transport parameters we shall notice that the mobile mobile model yields two concentrations at each time and location which essentially uses a binary distribution to approximate the actual concentration distribution however the mobile mobile model aims to approximate the concentration variance instead of evaluating the concentration distribution 3 behavior of concentration variance within the flux as we indicate in the introduction the mobile mobile model provides two concentrations that contribute to the flow flux while mobile immobile models only provides one concentration to the flow thus the mobile mobile model can quantify concentration variances and reaction rate variations but mobile immobile models cannot because the immobile concentration is not counted in the flow flux regardless how the immobile domain is conceptualized in the following we will focus on the concentration variance within the flux for a step input at the inlet representing a displacement scenario of the injected solution replacing the resident solution the concentration breakthrough curves are simply the time integrals of the solutions presented in the previous section the normalized root mean concentration variance nrmcv is used to quantify the concentration variance within the flux ris et al 1999 luo and cirpka 2011 14 nrmcv σ c 2 dt c max c min in which c max 1 and c min 0 for a step input the concentration variance within the flux at a given location x 1 for the outlet is controlled by the dimensionless parameters β η p e and d a in which β and η mainly control the flow velocity and discharge contrast whereas p e and d a describe the mixing effects 3 1 effects of flow contrast fig 1 shows the effects of the porosity ratio and discharge contrast or hydraulic conductivity contrast for given constant mixing parameters p e and d a and porosity ratio β the concentration variance within the flux is a non monotonic function of the discharge contrast η fig 1a the maximum concentration variance occurs at an intermediate value of η this observation is consistent to the findings of luo and cirpka 2011 macroscopic mean models that perfectly fit flux averaged conservative concentration btcs may not improve the prediction of mixing controlled reactive transport in cases with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrast because it is necessary to quantify and account for the variability of reaction rates caused by variations of concentrations in the flux luo and cirpka 2011 in high contrast cases most flow takes place in the fast flow paths which results in a small variance of the flux weighted concentration even though the offset in the breakthrough between the slow and fast travel paths is substantial fig 1b shows that the concentration variance monotonically decreases with the porosity ratio for given discharge contrast since the discharge contrast is related to the ratio of specific discharge an increase in the ratio of porosities implies a decrease in the ratio of effective velocity thus reducing the concentration variance fig 2 shows btcs of concentrations in both mobile domains the flux weighted average and the associated concentration variance the total concentration variance expressed by the nrmcv according to eq 22 depends on the magnitude of the concentration difference between the two domains and the duration over which the two concentrations significantly differ at a smaller contrast in discharge and velocity fig 2a the peak values of the concentration variance magnitude are larger but the duration of large concentration variance is shorter at a larger contrast in discharge and velocity fig 2c the mean btc has a long tail because of the slow flow but the mean value is dominated by the concentration in the fast flow resulting in a small concentration variance at an intermediate contrast in discharge fig 2b the integral effects of both variance magnitude and duration result in a large value of the total concentration variance nrmcv 3 2 effects of longitudinal dispersion and exchange between the domains fig 3 shows the effects of longitudinal dispersion and first order mass transfer on the total concentration variance nrmcv fig 3a shows that the nrmcv increases with the péclet number which implies that a smaller dispersivity or a longer travel distance yields a higher normalized concentration variance fig 3b shows that a higher damköhler number e g a larger first order mass transfer rate coefficient yields a smaller total concentration variance nrmcv because mass transfer between the fast and slow domains diminishes concentration differences between the two domains at the limit of very large d a values the kinetic mass transfer instantaneously reaches equilibrium resulting in identical concentrations in the two domains and thus zero concentration variance for small d a values the mobile mobile model approaches the limit of two non interacting stream tubes fig 3 essentially implies that larger mixing effects in both longitudinal and transverse directions yield smaller concentration variances within the flux however there is a fundamental difference between the cases with zero and non zero d a numbers fig 4 presents the effects of decreasing first order mass transfer on the concentration variance within the mobile mobile model kinetic mass transfer is the only mechanism that causes mixing between the fast and slow domains functioning similarly to transverse dispersion in continuous models with the decrease of d a the magnitude of the total concentration variance nrmcv increases comparing figs 3a with 4a while the non monotonic dependence on the discharge contrast remains if the exchange between the two domains is suppressed altogether d a 0 by contrast the dependence on the discharge contrast becomes monotonically increasing fig 4b the appendix contains the analytical proof for the monotonic behavior of the non interacting case these results are similar to transport in perfectly stratified aquifers with or without transverse dispersion across layers 4 numerical experiments of reactive transport in this section we use two specific numerical cases to demonstrate the applications of the mobile mobile model in simulating reactive transport in connected fields where multiple mobile domains are needed to account for concentration variations within the flow flux for reactive transport one numerical case is reactive transport in a two dimensional structured medium with different hydraulic conductivity contrasts and the other is two dimensional randomly heterogeneous fields with different hydraulic conductivity variances all cases are first solved numerically luo and cirpka 2011 to evaluate the full spatial temporal distribution of concentrations within the outflow which serve as the true cases in the field thus both mean concentrations and concentration variances can be evaluated based on the local scale outflow btcs in practice such detailed information would not be available thus we consider the most practical cases in which the only known information is the measured flux weighted btc of a conservative tracer at the domain outlet we then develop one dimensional mobile mobile and mobile immobile models to upscale the transport in the unknown two dimensional fields using the measured btcs finally the upscaled models are used to predict reactive transport and compare with the true cases the same procedure is applied to develop the mobile mobile model and the mobile immobile model model transport parameters including porosities discharge rates dispersivity and mass transfer rate coefficient are estimated by fitting model predicted flux weighted btcs of conservative tracers to those obtained in two dimensional cases reaction kinetics are then included in the transport model to predict btcs of reactive species in comparison to the mobile immobile model there is only one more parameter to be estimated for the mobile mobile model namely the velocity in the slow flow domain or the discharge contrast fore reactive transport we consider a replacement scenario with compounds undergoing an instantaneous irreversible bimolecular reaction with 1 1 1 stoichiometry a b c in which a b and c are aqueous species solutes species b is initially present throughout the domain and a is injected at the inflow boundary concentrations of a b and c can be solved using the mixing ratio approach based on btcs of a conservative compound de simoni et al 2005 2007 cirpka and valocchi 2007 an entropy based critical reaction time was also presented for such a mixing controlled reactive transport chiogna and rolle 2017 we quantitatively compare the performance of the mobile mobile and mobile immobile model by computing the root mean squared deviation rmsd between the numerically simulated concentration btcs two dimensional true cases and model predicted btcs 15 rmsd i 1 n c model c numerical 2 n p where c model and c numerical are concentrations predicted by models and numerical experiments respectively and p is the number of unknown parameters in addition the relative deviation of the peak concentration of species c is defined for quantifying the performance in reactive transport 16 ε p c max mm c max c max mim c max where c max mm c max mim and c max are the maximum concentrations predicted by the mobile mobile mobile immobile and fully resolved numerical experiments respectively models are more accurate when the rmsd and ε p decrease 4 1 low permeability inclusion in the first application we consider a single elliptical low permeability inclusion embedded in a rectangular two dimensional homogeneous isotropic domain fig 5 a composition of many low or high permeable inclusions may form structured or unstructured heterogeneous fields zinn and harvey 2003 suribhatla et al 2004 the hydraulic head is fixed at the left and right boundaries whereas no flow crosses the top and bottom boundaries the major and minor axes of the ellipse are half of the domain length and width respectively table 1 summarizes the hydraulic parameters used in the numerical case luo and cirpka 2011 solute transport in this domain is essentially controlled by the following two dimensionless parameters 17 k r k 1 k 2 pe v b 2 d t l in which k 1 and k 2 are the hydraulic conductivity in the exterior and interior regions of the inclusion respectively k r represents the hydraulic conductivity contrast v is the effective mean velocity within the entire domain b is the half width of the elliptical inclusion l is the domain length d t is the transverse dispersion coefficient and pe is the transverse péclet number fig 5 shows the concentration distributions at 0 5 pv a1 c1 the mean concentration btcs of a conservative tracer in the outflow a2 c2 the travel time distributions in the domain a3 c3 and the associated variance of the flux concentration in the outflow a4 c4 for three cases with different hydraulic conductivity contrast and similarly large péclet numbers pe 400 in all three cases a fraction of the total flux passes through the low conductivity inclusion while the remaining flux surpasses the inclusion a1 c1 the larger k r the less flux passes through the inclusion and the more flux surpasses the inclusion which results in a faster breakthrough time at the outflow and longer tailing of the mean btc in the outflow a2 c2 local btcs measured in each small elements at the outflow boundary are crowded in the case of k r 1 8 and more dispersed in the other two cases a2 c2 obvious bimodal behavior is observed in the travel time distribution for k r 1 8 a3 but is not observable for k r 10 b3 and k r 100 c3 because only in the case of a smaller conductivity contrast a substantial fraction of the flow passes through the inclusion resulting in two peaks after superimposing all local travel time distributions the variability in concentration a4 c4 results mainly from different times and shapes of local breakthrough between stream tubes passing through the low permeability inclusion and those bypassing it the variance peak decreases with the conductivity contrast because the variance within the flux is dominated by the fast flow luo and cirpka 2011 the case with larger conductivity contrast shows a significantly enhanced tail after the first peak in both mean concentration and concentration variance fig 5 also shows the model fits of the mobile mobile and mobile immobile models fitted dimensionless parameters are provided in the supplementary material both models provide a good prediction for the outflow btcs of a conservative tracer for a step injection at the inflow boundary a2 c2 for the travel time distributions which correspond to an impulse tracer injection in the inflow the mobile mobile model yields a better fit than the mobile immobile model a3 c3 particularly for the case with k r 1 8 where the bimodal behavior is characterized by the mobile mobile model but not by the mobile immobile model the rmsd summarized in table 2 shows that the mobile mobile model preforms better than the mobile immobile model in all cases and their performance becomes similar for high conductivity contrasts however mobile immobile models cannot describe the concentration variances in the flux because only a single concentration can be predicted with the btc fitting the mobile mobile model predicts the concentration variance a4 c4 particularly well for the cases with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrasts k r 1 8 and 10 for the high contrast case k r 100 the mobile mobile model reproduces the long tail of the concentration variance but misses the peak fig 6 shows the model prediction for reactive transport with a bimolecular instantaneous reaction although both models fit the btcs of the mean conservative tracer concentration well fig 5 a2 c2 the mobile mobile model predicts the btcs of reactive species concentrations much better than the mobile immobile model particularly for k r 1 8 and 10 reflecting that the mobile mobile model involves the segregation of the solute flux into two distinct zones with different velocity fig 5 a4 c4 the rmsd of the reactive btcs and the relative deviation in the peak concentration of species c table 2 significantly decreases when switching from the mobile immobile to the mobile mobile model in all reactive transport cases considered these cases demonstrate that while it may not be necessary to consider flow segregation if the mean concentration of a conservative compound is of interest this process may be important for reactive transport controlled by longitudinal mixing particularly for media with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrasts where the concentration variations in the flux are important shown by the local btcs of all species 4 2 connected random heterogeneous fields the second set of simulations are performed in two dimensional connected random heterogeneous fields fig 7 a and d which are generated by absolute value transformation of multi gaussian fields with subsequent rescaling zinn and harvey 2003 gong et al 2013 presented how the spatial correlation of the transformed field can be derived from that of the original field we assume gaussian covariance models for the original multi gaussian fields and variances of log hydraulic conductivity of 1 and 6 to represent mildly and strongly heterogeneous fields all hydrogeological parameters are listed in table 3 the mean flow is oriented in the x direction transport is solved on a streamline oriented grid with grid resolution identical to that of the rectangular grid using the streamline method of cirpka et al 1999a b the streamlines are rather uniformly distributed in the case of a small log conductivity variance fig 7b whereas they are strongly focused in the zones with large hydraulic conductivities forming narrow preferential paths in the strongly heterogeneous case fig 7e the largest fraction of flow is restricted to these preferential paths causing much earlier breakthrough figs 7f and 8 d than in the mildly heterogeneous case figs 7c and 8a fig 8 shows the model fit of the mean btcs of a conservative tracer the travel time distributions and the variance in the high variance case the local btcs vary more strongly resulting in earlier breakthrough and longer tailing of the mean btc fig 8a and d no obvious bimodal behavior is observed in the random heterogeneous fields because the local travel times cover the full range of breakthrough times which differs from the case of the single low permeability inclusion where local breakthrough times were clustered in two peaks fig 5 a3 the concentration variance decreases with increasing variance of the log conductivity because the fraction of flow outside of the preferential flow paths decreases also transverse mixing within the preferential flow zones is enhanced by the short transverse mixing lengths thus the concentration variation in highly heterogeneous fields may be smaller than in mildly heterogeneous fields both mobile mobile and mobile immobile models fit the btcs of a conservative tracer in the outflow quite well the mobile mobile model yields a good prediction of the concentration variance in the case with low variance of log conductivity and underestimates the concentration variance in the highly heterogeneous case while the mobile immobile model does not predict any variance of the flux concentration fig 9 shows the predictions of reactive transport with a bimolecular instantaneous reaction in the connected random heterogeneous media in general the mobile mobile model yields better predictions than the mobile immobile model with increasing variance of log hydraulic conductivity the predictions by the two models become more similar because the majority of flow occurs in preferential paths which dominate the evaluation of the flux averaged concentration and make it unnecessary to consider flow segregation thus models with a single mobile domain perform better in highly than in mildly heterogeneous cases the rmsd and peak deviation summarized in table 2 also show that the mobile mobile model yields a better prediction in terms of both the btcs and the peak concentration of product c we want to remark that the mobile immobile predictions using connected random fields are better than in the cases with a single inclusion because the domain size is larger than 30 integral scales and the prediction error decreases with increasing travel distance which is consistent with the common understanding that mixing can catch up with spreading in the large distance limit 5 conclusions mobile immobile models with one mobile concentration are incapable of representing multiple flow paths with intermediate velocity contrasts incomplete mixing and thus concentration variations within the solute flux this has been identified as the major mechanism responsible for inaccurate predictions of reactive transport controlled by longitudinal mixing e g kapoor et al 1997 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 such models work well only when the concentration variations within the flux are small or when the reaction is linear because the transfer from conservative components to reactive species concentrations is usually nonlinear it is clear that neglecting non negligible variations may lead to a mass balance error thus it is generally necessary to consider concentration variations in the upscaling of mixing controlled reactive transport in the present study we propose adopting the mobile mobile model for such purposes because the mobile mobile model gives two local flux concentrations one in the fast and the other in the slow flow domain it conveniently predicts both the mean and variance of the flux concentration the concentration variance within the flux is controlled by four dimensionless parameters namely the porosity and discharge ratios the péclet number and the damköhler number the normalized total concentration variance decreases with the increase of the porosity ratio and the damköhler number and with the decrease of the péclet number while it changes non monotonically with the discharge ratio the maximum concentration variance occurs at intermediate discharge contrasts we have numerically tested the mobile mobile model for an instantaneous irreversible bimolecular reaction in domains with a single low permeability inclusion and in connected random heterogeneous media the instantaneous reaction considered here poses the limiting case of mixing controlled reactive transport reaction kinetics generally would lead to less importance of mixing cirpka et al 2008 leading to a better performance of both mobile mobile and mobile immobile transport models compared to each other in the present study the case of a single inclusion could be characterized by two dimensionless variables the hydraulic conductivity contrast and the transverse péclet number in the simulations using random fields the hydraulic conductivity contrast was replaced by the variance of log conductivity our results indicate that both mobile mobile and mobile immobile models describe the mean btcs of conservative compounds in the outflow well however the mobile mobile model generally better predicts btcs of the reactive compounds in both the single inclusion and random heterogeneous media particularly in the cases of elliptical inclusions with intermediate hydraulic conductivity contrast where bimodal behavior is shown in the travel time distribution the improvement of the mobile mobile model is significant for the case with a long concentration tail the mobile mobile model performed well with respect to the tails but the peak difference was not well captured if conservative concentration btcs can be well characterized by macroscopic models with a single flux concentration such as the classical ade and mobile immobile models the fitted mobile mobile model usually approaches these macroscopic models in such cases the mobile mobile model performs the same way as the single flux domain models insufficiently quantifying the concentration variance and yielding similar predictions of concentration btcs of reactive species for mixing controlled reactive transport in general however the mobile mobile model provides two concentrations that contribute to the flux and can be used to evaluate concentration variance yielding the chance of better predicting mixing controlled reactive transport than macroscopic models with a single flux concentration under which conditions flux averaged btcs of conservative compounds are sufficient to unanimously identify multiple flux domains is an important question but beyond the scope of the current study in the supplementary material we provides some preliminary results for the performance improvement of the mobile mobile model in randomly heterogeneous media based on numerical simulations of multiple realizations acknowledgement the authors thank the constructive comments from three anonymous reviewers c

7334,data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf are often applied to hydrological models with minimal state volume capacity constraints enforced during ensemble generation flux constraints are rarely if ever applied consequently model states can be adjusted beyond physically reasonable limits compromising the integrity of model output in this paper we investigate the effect of constraining the enkf on forecast performance a free run in which no assimilation is applied is compared to a completely unconstrained enkf implementation a typical hydrological implementation in which mass constraints are enforced to ensure non negativity and capacity thresholds of model states are not exceeded and then to a more tightly constrained implementation where flux as well as mass constraints are imposed to force the rate of water movement to from ensemble states to be within physically consistent boundaries a three year period 2008 2010 was selected from the available data record 1976 2010 this was specifically chosen as it had no significant data gaps and represented well the range of flows observed in the longer dataset over this period the standard implementation of the enkf no constraints contained eight hydrological events where multiple physically inconsistent state adjustments were made all were selected for analysis mass constraints alone did little to improve forecast performance in fact several were significantly degraded compared to the free run in contrast the combined use of mass and flux constraints significantly improved forecast performance in six events relative to all other implementations while the remaining two events showed no significant difference in performance placing flux as well as mass constraints on the data assimilation framework encourages physically consistent state estimation and results in more accurate and reliable forward predictions of streamflow for robust decision making we also experiment with the observation error which has a profound effect on filter performance we note an interesting tension exists between specifying an error which reflects known uncertainties and errors in the measurement versus an error that allows optimal filter updating keywords constrained ensemble kalman filter data assimilation observation error hydrology 1 introduction and scope the use of data assimilation through state estimation is increasingly recognised as an essential part of any hydrological forecasting application liu et al 2012 without it relatively large errors can accumulate in the model output even over the short term i e hours to days collischonn et al 2007 state estimation methods use observations to adjust model states by taking account of errors in both the observation s and the model clark et al 2008 reichle 2008 salamon and feyen 2009 vrugt et al 2005 with the aim to reduce errors associated with the data and model structure and improve the physical realism of the model output one of the most common state estimation methods used in hydrology is the ensemble kalman filter enkf the enkf utilises monte carlo methods to generate an ensemble of model trajectories consistent with the main sources of uncertainty in the given problem although some calibration or fine tuning of relevant error specification is necessary for optimal filter performance noh et al 2014 and most applications would ensure some physical consistency e g non negativity of sub surface states application of the standard enkf does not necessarily require the ensemble of model states to be within physically realistic limits consequently states can be perturbed to unrealistic and inconsistent values to obtain a closer match to the observations which can lead to erratic streamflow simulations clark et al 2008 unrealistic perturbations can be particularly severe when modelled streamflow is significantly different to observed streamflow although a high observation error term will limit the severity of fluctuations as we note later weerts and el serafy 2006 contend that error specification should be given due consideration while error settings which allow large perturbations can increase the possibility of successful forecasting we argue that it is not realistic to allow unjustified perturbations which can subsequently compromise the accuracy and reliability of forward predictions to address this issue constraints can be applied to ensure physical limits are not exceeded constraints have been widely applied in oceanic and atmospheric applications janjic et al 2014 simon and simon 2006 simon and tien li 2002 thacker 2007 in hydrologic modelling states generally represent some component of water storage for example groundwater and soil water storage these should be non negative and where possible have some maximum capacity constraint constraints can be imposed in a number of ways wang et al 2009 compared the naive projection and accept reject methods for incorporating constraints into the enkf non negativity constraints were applied to five state variables three quick flow states one baseflow state and soil water content and a capacity constraint to ensure the soil state does not exceed maximum soil water content in dual state parameter estimation approaches moradkhani et al 2005 shi et al 2014 wang et al 2009 predefined ranges are used to bound the ensemble generation to ensure non negative volumes pan and wood 2006 and li et al 2012 add mass conservation constraints to ensure closure of the water balance for land surface modelling checking for physical realism or consistent model behaviour is often recommended clark et al 2008 xie et al 2014 although little specific guidance is provided on how to avoid model behaviour violating physical laws few studies constrain the perturbations themselves the danger of forecasting streamflow using unconstrained flux perturbations as the only innovations to states has been demonstrated lee et al 2011 samuel et al 2014 seo et al 2009 however rather than searching for ways to further constrain the state estimation procedure these studies focussed on showing how assimilating soil moisture as well as streamflow could improve analysis and forecast performance it is often the case however that soil moisture and other state information is not readily available so streamflow may be the only obtainable variable that can be closely related to model states moradkhani et al 2005 and abaza et al 2014 apply proportionality factors to ensure the generated ensemble spread is within a meaningful range clark et al 2008 and subsequently mcmillan et al 2013 and xie et al 2014 impose fractional factors to allow larger model errors when model fluxes are large and smaller model errors when fluxes are small while their approach does not account for periods where the model inadequately simulates large model fluxes or where these fluxes are missed clark et al 2008 it does address the temporal variability of the error which is more representative of the nature of model errors and leads to improved forecast performance a large source of uncertainty lies in the forcing data e g precipitation and evapotranspiration due to the difficulty in fully representing the spatial and temporal variability of these inputs in the model the ability to provide accurate estimates of forcing uncertainty would help to understand and identify other sources of error and uncertainty in the model mcmillan et al 2011 and can lead to more reliable and successful data assimilation as shown in noh et al 2014 rakovec et al 2012 and weerts and el serafy 2006 amongst others a number of studies have specifically investigated the effect of perturbing forcing with few studies specifically considering constraining model states in the assimilation process while the focus of this paper is on the latter an important next step is to combine methodologies for perturbing forcing with constraints on state innovations examining both the question of whether the combination improves model performance and the question of whether inconsistencies in predictive outputs and state innovations can point to ways to improve specification of both input error definition and state constraints in summary although the importance of plausible state updating has been acknowledged in the literature the implications of inadequate constraint of the enkf on the reliability of forward streamflow predictions have not been demonstrated in any detail in addition although the sensitivity of the enkf to the specified measurement error has been noted strategies to overcome this have focussed on bringing in supplementary data rather than exploring methods to allow more robust state updating where streamflow observations remain the only obtainable measure while the use of basic non negativity and or capacity constraints is not uncommon this is the first study to specifically investigate the effect of also imposing flux constraints controlling the rate of water movement to or from ensemble model states on the accuracy and reliability of forecast streamflow we compare three approaches 1 a naïve enkf approach in which no constraints are applied to model output 2 an arguably more typical approach in hydrology where mass constraints are enforced to ensure non negativity and capacity thresholds where possible of model states are not exceeded and 3 our new further constrained approach where flux constraints are imposed in conjunction with the more typical mass constraints so that state perturbations as well as state extremes are kept within physically realistic ranges the three approaches are demonstrated using a lumped conceptual hydrological model maxwell 2013 in the tauranga taupo catchment new zealand streamflow observations are used to update four soil storage throughflow interflow and baseflow model states it is shown that mass constraints alone are not sufficient to significantly improve forecast performance in the majority of events analysed the combination of mass and flux constraints results in more reliable forecasting of streamflow compared to the standard and mass constrained enkf implementations the implications for the accuracy and reliability of model predictions are demonstrated we also experiment with the observation error term in the calculation of the kalman gain often paid little attention in the literature this term has a profound effect on filter performance as further discussed in crow and van loon 2006 and reichle 2008 very high confidence in the observations relative to the model draws the filter rapidly toward the observations by allowing larger perturbations to model states on the other hand specifying a large measurement error will give greater weight to the model preventing significant perturbations and drawing the filter toward an outcome similar to the model output from the free run despite these previous authors having noted this tension most studies simply note this term should reflect the accuracy of the measurement instrument processing and representativeness evensen 2003 mcmillan et al 2013 xie and zhang 2010 with little consideration given to its subsequent impact on filter performance we found interesting conflicts between a realistic specification of the error and its impact on the filter s ability to constrain state adjustments the hydrological model data used catchment area calibration procedure implementation of the constrained enkf and experimental set up is described in section 2 the results are discussed in section 3 and include a comparative analysis of model performance over the eight events between 2008 and 2010 we conclude with a summary of the main findings and suggest areas for future work 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data the tauranga taupo catchment fig 1 covers 197 km2 and drains an area of impermeable sedimentary basement greywacke geology in its headwaters and more permeable volcanic lithologies in its lower reaches it has a mean flow of 12 2 m3 s based on predominantly sub hourly observations between 1976 and 2009 it is primarily covered in forestry and has predominantly volcanic soils which are generally free draining with considerable water holding capacity molloy 1998 rainfall has been recorded at te kono road site no 960010 since 1976 observed data from this site was used and a multiplier parameterised as part of the calibration process applied to ensure a reasonable water balance missing values are infilled using the normal ratio method using the nearest gauge which has a high hourly correlation to the te kono road station potential evapotranspiration pe computed from atmospheric observations recorded at turangi site no 25643 is used to drive the model missing values are replaced with the mean daily pe for the month in question this daily pe data was disaggregated into hourly data by approximating the diurnal cycle of direct radiation corrected for periods with high relative humidity 90 and minimal mean global radiation inputs to the model are assumed perfect although it is noted that an error term could be added to these inputs as part of the modelling and or assimilation process model simulations were forced with fifteen minute interpolated rainfall and hourly pe data 2 2 conceptual hydrologic model the lumped conceptual model used in this study is described below further details of its development and rationale can be found in maxwell 2013 the structure is similar to many accepted conceptual models in that it uses a number of storage elements representing important flowpaths in the catchment each of these stores is connected by mathematical functions describing their respective storage and depletion the time delay between system inputs and the timing of the response observed at the gauge is accounted for through the lag time parameterised as part of the calibration process a soil moisture accounting module partitions input rainfall into evapotranspiration storage and runoff rainfall not lost to evaporation infiltrates the soil where it is readily available for plant water use hence transpiring at the potential evaporation rate down to a critical point below which it becomes difficult to extract actual evapotranspiration below this point is reduced proportionally to the volume of water in the soil in situations where the maximum infiltration rate or the soils maximum saturation capacity are exceeded overland flow is generated subsurface drainage occurs once the soil has reached field capacity catchment average soil water content is modelled and includes areas which have reached saturation earlier than other areas to account for this some drainage is allowed to occur between a minimum soil water content threshold and a catchment wide field capacity value drawing on the concept of a variable source area see hewlett and hibbert 1967 dunne and black 1970 and references therein drainage is calculated as a fraction of the infiltrated rainfall given the proportion of the catchment under saturation steenhuis et al 1995 water from the soil layer is released into three linear stores throughflow interflow and baseflow these stores represent different pathways in which water can move through the subsurface each store has a specific residence time associated with it throughflow is the quickest pathway and baseflow the slowest with interflow somewhere in between the volume of water entering each store is determined by multiplying the amount of water draining the soil layer by the parameterised relative proportion for each store the new volume of water in the soil and the three sub surface stores are calculated by adding the amount of water draining into the store at the current time step to the store volume at the previous time step and subtracting any losses to runoff these losses are determined by dividing the store volume by the respective store residence times the relative contributions of flow from the respective stores and any overland flow that may have occurred are combined to determine total runoff direct rainfall to and evaporative losses from the river itself are assumed negligible 2 3 model calibration model calibration was undertaken over a five year period between 1 june 2003 and 31 may 2008 using average hourly streamflow values this period was selected because it had an uninterrupted rainfall record inspection of flow duration curves also indicated that this period included a representative range of the streamflow experienced over the entire record 40 years missing only the most extreme peak flood observations rainfall and streamflow records were also consistent with regard to residual mass curves which show the cumulative departures between mean annual rainfall and mean annual streamflow over the period classic monte carlo sampling was used to randomly generate parameter sets from a feasible and pre defined parameter space table 1 gives details on the thirteen parameters calibrated and associated parameter ranges minimum and maximum parameter values were selected based on an analysis of relationships between catchment physical and hydrologic attributes the parameter space is sampled using a uniform distribution chosen due to its simplicity and because we had no a priori reasons to give any particular part of the parameter space more or less weighting than the rest one million calibrations were obtained although this is more extensive than is often achievable it still cannot comprehensively sample the entire parameter space given the number of parameters to be calibrated table 1 this number of calibrations was selected to provide a balance between statistical accuracy and computational constraints each simulation generates a parameter set the performance of which is described by an objective function or goodness of fit measure the compiled matlab code was submitted into a batch processing environment comprising sgi c2112 compute nodes each node having 2x amd opeteron 6174 12 core cpus and 64 gb memory 1 original interactive matlab codebase was compiled using the matlab compiler to allow for submission into a batch processing environment vuw s science faculty high performance computing facility comprising sgi c2112 computer nodes each node having 2x amd opeteron 6174 12 core cpus and 64 gb memory which uses son of grid engine sge as the local resource manager lrm 1 model performance was evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency index kge gupta et al 2009 a weighted decomposition of the commonly used nash sutcliffe efficiency index the kge is written 1 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the correlation between simulated and observed flows the quantity α is a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β represents the overall bias ratio between the mean simulated and mean observed flows the kge is applied in this study because it was able to generate parameter sets which provide a better representation of the hydrological response characteristics in the tauranga taupo catchment than the more commonly used nash sutcliffe efficiency index maxwell 2013 a multi criteria approach is used in which the fit to the time series and fit to the flow duration curve is evaluated the five best performing parameter sets which are able to sufficiently simulate the hydrograph response in terms of timing of response and recession characteristics fit to the time series while also adequately capturing the variability and range of flow for the catchment fit to the flow duration curve are retained with the model output from all five used to account for parametric uncertainty all five parameter sets are used in each of the enkf strategies outlined in section 4 and the output from each used in the analysis of performance with this approach we were able to demonstrate the importance of accounting for parametric uncertainty as one of the five parameters did not perform as well as the other four refer section 4 although we recognise that a convergence study may be useful to ascertain the optimal number of parameter sets to retain this was not the major objective of the study and is therefore recommended as an area of future research kge values for the five selected parameter sets were between 0 905 and 0 907 for the fit to the time series ts and 0 980 to 0 988 for the fit to the flow duration curve fdc over the evaluation period 1 june 2008 to 1 august 2011 kge values for these parameter sets were lower ts 0 799 0 804 and fdc 0 833 0 840 but still showed good agreement lag times in this catchment parameterised as part of the calibration process ranged between 3 75 h and 4 75 h 2 4 the constrained ensemble kalman filter 2 4 1 the enkf algorithm the enkf is a two step sequential data assimilation routine which uses monte carlo methods to generate an ensemble of model states errors in the model and observations are quantified a priori and the relative error used as weights to update model states through the kalman gain matrix in the forecast step f the updated model states from the previous time step are propagated forward until time t the state vectors x t f i with i varying between 1 and nens combine to become an nstate x nens matrix χ t f where nstate is the number of states nens is the number of ensemble members 2 χ t f x t f 1 x t f nens in this study where a lumped conceptual model is applied the background 4 100 matrix is made up of the four model states baseflow interflow throughflow and soil storage and 100 ensemble members selected as a balance between statistical robustness and computational efficiency so that the matrix becomes 3 χ t f x t f 1 ss x t f 100 ss x t f 1 tf x t f 100 tf x t f 1 if x t f 100 if x t f 1 bf x t f 100 bf where ss tf if and bf represent the soil storage throughflow interflow and baseflow states respectively since the true state is not known the mean of the ensemble x is assumed to be a best estimate of the actual state truth where 4 x t f 1 nens i 1 nens x t f i where i is the i th ensemble member and the spread of the ensemble members around the mean representing the error variance is 5 e x t f x t f 1 x t f x t f nens x t f the output from the model y given the ensemble of model states is the model equivalent of the observation with a mean of y and forecast error statistics e y t b 6 y t f 1 nens i 1 nens y t f i 7 e y t f y t f 1 y t f y t f nens y t f the relationship between the relative uncertainties between the model states and model output is described by error covariances assuming gaussian error statistics the model error covariance is computed directly so that 8 c xy t f 1 nens 1 e x t f e y t f t 9 c yy t f 1 nens 1 e y t f e y t f t where c xy t f is the forecasted cross covariance of modelled states and modelled streamflow c yy t f is the forecasted output error covariance and t denotes the matrix transposition in the analysis step the model states are related t0 discharge observations in the calculation of the kalman gain κ t the kalman gain is a weight matrix describing the relative uncertainties of model states and observations determined by the error covariances obtained in the forecast step it reflects the amount of confidence in the model compared to the observations and is written 10 κ t c xy t f c yy t f r 1 where r represents the observation error covariance matrix i e σ 2 see below observation errors are assumed uncorrelated implying that r reduces to a diagonal matrix where each diagonal term corresponds to the error variance for each observation the update step then becomes 11 x t a i x t f i κ t y t i h x t f i where x t a i is the updated model state matrix y i the streamflow observations and h is the observation operator used to equate the model equivalent of the observations in this application the same hydrological model is used to both map the model inputs to the states forward model operator and to relate modelled states to the observations observation operator as such y t f i essentially becomes the model output given the ensemble of model states that is 12 h x t f i y t f i since there is only one monitoring point the four states are related to one observation at each assimilation time step observations are assimilated at fifteen minute intervals to map the observations into state space the observation is compared to the modelled unrouted discharge a number of time steps behind allowing for the time it takes for the input to the system to reach the outlet in this application calibrated catchment lag times are used for this comparison 2 4 2 sensitivity to the observation error the observations are not considered perfect and are treated as random variables with a mean of the actual observation and the variance representing the measurement error this measurement error ε t i is often unknown so a parallel assimilation cycle is run where i is the number of ensembles so that 13 y t i y t ε t i where the ε t i is generated as a gaussian random variable with a zero mean normal distribution and a variance of σ 2 modelled as a percentage of the observed streamflow value filter performance is sensitive to the specification of σ crow and van loon 2006 while the observation error is known to have a considerable impact on filter performance it is often given little attention in the hydrological literature most studies simply note this term should reflect the accuracy of the measurement instrument processing and representativeness streamflow observations are commonly considered to have measurement errors of 5 15 abaza et al 2014 dechant and moradkhani 2012 li et al 2015 although it is noted that the error is likely to be larger at higher stage levels compared to periods of lower streamflow clark et al 2008 however an interesting tension arises between specifying an appropriate measurement error based on known measurement interpretation and representativeness of the observation and optimal filter adjustment we investigate the impact of different error levels on enkf results by varying the observation error and comparing model output to the observations 2 4 3 specification of physical constraints in hydrology it is often the case that the enkf is implemented with little restriction placed on how the ensemble of model states is generated during the forecast step in these cases states can be adjusted to beyond what is physically possible ensembles are generated by stochastically perturbing model states these perturbations aim to reflect the uncertainty associated with the model parameters and structure clark et al 2008 however this uncertainty is notoriously difficult to quantify and in the absence of other knowledge it is common to assume a normally or uniformly distributed error with zero mean for e g clark et al 2008 thiboult and anctil 2015 in this study state perturbations are realised from a normally distributed random distribution using a standard deviation of 5 of the state volumes as thiboult and anctil 2015 note more scrutiny is needed to define reasonable variances we then investigate the effect of constraining the data assimilation framework through adding mass and flux constraints to both state volumes and state perturbations on forecast performance mass constraints ensure states are non negative and do not exceed capacity they are applied before the forecast step keeping only those ensembles which do not violate non negativity and capacity constraints if constraints are violated ensemble members continue to be drawn until 100 members that satisfy all the specified state constraints are obtained for the soil storage state a constraint is applied based on the saturation capacity of the soil given the difficulty in obtaining volume capacities of sub surface baseflow interflow and throughflow states they do not have an upper limit on their volumes imposed so that 14 x t a tf 0 15 x t a if 0 16 x t a bf 0 17 0 x t a ss v ss sat where x t a ss x t a tf x t a if x t a bf are the updated soil storage throughflow interflow and baseflow states at time t respectively and v ss sat is the saturation capacity of the soil obtained from model calibration flux constraints are also applied prior to the forecast step during ensemble generation and relate to the rate of movement to from each of the four model states and could be designed to vary according to the time of the year antecedent conditions or state volumes in this study perturbations are randomly generated with a standard deviation of one third the maximum state volume change simulated in the free run model output over the 1998 2010 evaluation period this was deemed appropriate since 1998 2010 period reflected the same range of streamflow over the much longer 1976 2010 period for which observations have been recorded the perturbations can therefore be written 18 ρ t ss i 1 3 max δ ss 19 ρ t tf i 1 3 max δ tf 20 ρ t if i 1 3 max δ if 21 ρ t bf i 1 3 max δ bf where ρ t ss i ρ t tf i ρ t if i and ρ t bf i are the perturbations to the soil storage throughflow interflow and baseflow states respectively and max δ ss max δ tf max δ if and max δ bf is the maximum state volume change respectively as specified above perturbations to the baseflow state also depend on the amount of water held in the store the baseflow state can hold considerably more water than the soil storage throughflow and interflow states small changes in its volume can have a significant impact on streamflow therefore as the volume of water in this state increases the amplitude of the perturbation allowed is reduced so that 22 0 v t bf 100 2 max δ bf ρ t bf i 2 max δ bf 23 100 v t bf 200 max δ bf ρ t bf i max δ bf 24 0 v t bf 100 0 5 max δ bf ρ t bf i 0 5 max δ bf where v t bf is the baseflow state volume at time t and ρ t bf i is the baseflow state perturbation at time t for the ith ensemble member the basis for this is that the amount of water routed to the stream from each state is proportional to its volume the more water in the state the larger amount of water contributing to runoff likewise a large perturbation during saturated conditions higher volume will allow a more significant change in streamflow than the same perturbation in drier conditions lower volume in both the soil storage and throughflow states perturbations are further constrained after periods of no rainfall water moves through these states relatively quickly so it is unlikely that there would be significant positive changes in volume of these states as they get progressively drier without further input from rainfall in this study if there has been no rain in 12 h perturbations are capped to a maximum of 5 of the two state s volumes allowing only small positive perturbations or more extensive negative perturbations to be made so that and 25 ρ t ss i 0 5 x v t ss i mm and ρ t tf i 0 5 x v t tf i where v ss is the soil storage state volume and ρ ss and ρ tf are the perturbations to the soil storage and throughflow states respectively outside of dry periods the amplitude of the perturbations to the soil storage throughflow and interflow states are kept the same over the entire period irrespective of volume as these states have generally much lower storage capacity than the baseflow state and not the same volumetric limits as the soil storage state the same degree of control on the constraints was deemed unnecessary for the purpose of this study it may be beneficial to adjust constraints depending on the time of year or wet dry periods however care must be taken to ensure some flexibility remains too many constraints may significantly increase computational burden resulting in the assimilation routine unable to find a suitable solution within the short timeframes needed for operational forecasting 2 5 experimental setup to investigate the effect of constraining the enkf we compare the output from four model simulations in the first no assimilation is applied free run the second model run applied an unconstrained implementation of the enkf mass constraints relating to non negativity and any capacity constraints are applied in the third model run with mass plus flux constraints in the fourth the output from all four experiments are compared and analysed in all experiments all four states are updated at each assimilation step given the lag in the system we cannot assume that any of the four state volumes and fluxes should not be modified at any one time step however as specified in the previous section the perturbations to state volumes and fluxes are constrained based on a series of rules relating to the amount of water in the state and whether there has been any rain in the preceding period event selection is based on the output of the unconstrained enkf a physically inconsistent adjustment to a model state is defined as a flux and volume which exceeds twice the maximum absolute flux or volume of the state in the free run model output over the 1998 2010 period table 2 these thresholds are deemed large enough to account for the possibility of more extreme events occurring in the catchment outside of those experienced over the 1998 2010 period the only exception is the soil storage state which has a modelled physical threshold equal to the saturation capacity of the soil defined by calibrated model parameters of the 53 hydrological events 2 for the purpose of this study a hydrological event is defined as those times during which streamflow exceeded the 20 percentile of streamflow based on the flow duration curve for the catchment events were distinguished by whether streamflow receded to below the average flow and whether rainfall was zero for at least 24 h 2 that occurred over the 2008 2010 period perturbation and or flux constraints were violated in eight 15 these hydrological events tended to occur during high streamflow events top 20 of streamflow values arguably a time when accurate streamflow forecasts are most important one parameter set violated constraints three times more frequently than the other four parameter sets suggesting that this set may be less reliable analysis of assimilation innovations could be used to subsequently inform further refinement of parameter sets to reduce bias and improve model calibration and structural evaluation maxwell 2013 further investigation of this issue was outside of the scope of this paper but is recommended as an area of future work for the purpose of this study the starting point from which the forecast performance is analysed for each of the eight events is randomly chosen from only those time steps within the event in which constraints were violated in at least three of the five parameter sets although all five parameter sets were kept for analysis seven of the eight events were related to perturbations to the baseflow state with the remaining event associated with perturbations to the interflow state table 3 defined thresholds were not exceeded at any time during the period for the soil storage and throughflow states forecast model streamflow for each event was compared against the forecast model output from the assimilation run with no constraints performance was assessed over a two day forecast period using the kge described in section 2 3 however it was apparent the normalisation by the range of streamflow values over the forecast period could lead to under reporting of performance by the kge particularly in periods of low streamflow where the relative difference may be considerable but the absolute difference may be significantly less conversely it is also possible that the kge over reports performance in high flow events to overcome this an absolute measure of performance was considered in the evaluation the root mean square error rmse is an aggregate measure of the magnitude of error between the model output and the observations and gives higher weight to larger errors it can be written 26 rmse j 1 n x obs j x mod j 2 n where x obs j is the j th observation x mod j is the corresponding j th model output and n is the number of paired data points model output within 0 025 of the kge or its components was deemed to show little difference between the constrained and unconstrained model output those that were 0 025 were considered improved and those 0 025 were considered degraded as long as the absolute difference was also greater i e rmse 10 of the observed mean where observations below 1o comes are given a threshold of 1 comics 3 results and discussion table 4 shows the root mean square error rmse of the modelled streamflow for each parameter set between 2008 and 2010 as a function of the standard deviation of the observation error the error levels range between 0 1 through to 5 the latter being at the lower end of the typical streamflow measurement errors noted previously as the standard deviation increases the rmse becomes larger there are minimal differences between the modelled streamflow and the observations with a very small observation error for our specific study a realistic amount of error gave a restrictively low weight to the observations in the calculation of the kalman gain compromising the filters ability to update model states at times to values that allow predictions to become consistent with observations fig 2 a as the measurement error increases the weight given to the observations in determining the kalman gain is reduced reichle 2008 this effectively over constrains the filter shifting the model toward the free run model output crow and van loon 2006 conversely too small an error can give too much weight to the measurements drawing the model toward the observations fig 2d more confidence in the observations allows larger gains to be made but also results in more erratic perturbations which is demonstrated by the number of constraint violations at this error level compared to higher standard deviations a problem that can be partially rectified by applying sensible flux constraints as our study demonstrates table 5 we therefore argue that a balance between a realistic amount of observational error and optimal filter updating is needed this may also be particularly important for other applications where more uncertain measurements such as soil moisture or groundwater volumes are assimilated for the main part of this study comparison of event performance as filter constraints vary σ is defined as 1 of the observed streamflow value this implies a larger error at time of higher discharge model output from the free run unconstrained mass constrained and mass plus flux constrained assimilation routines were compared over the 2008 2010 period fig 3 table 6 shows the average kge and rmse values for each event analysed both averaged over the model output from the five parameter sets used the free run fig 3a shows some significant bias while the free run model can track recession periods relatively well during this period there are some inconsistences during significant hydrological events in which peak streamflow is not adequately represented the enkf is able to reduce this bias and effect a closer match to reality especially when flux constraints fig 3d are applied the noticeable jumps in streamflow simulations during some recession periods seen in fig 3d are likely to be a result of particularly inaccurate precipitation forcing with the constraints to state fluxes imposed it can be difficult for the assimilation routine to adjust model states to a level consistent with the observations appropriate perturbations of the precipitation input may help to avoid such issues but large discrepancies are generally caused by autocorrelation and spatial representativeness issues which are rarely built into our error models implementing the enkf without constraint fig 3b or with mass constraints only fig 3c also appears to improve performance compared to the free run however in these cases state adjustments were often found to lack any physical realism the eight events selected for analysis are examples of this and show the implications for reliable streamflow forecasting at these times the effect of constraining the enkf on streamflow predictions over a two day forecast period is shown for all eight events in figs 4 and 5 in general compared to the free run model output with no filter the standard unconstrained implementation of the enkf did little to improve forecast performance with a marked deterioration evident in four events and significant improvement in just one event 3 fig 6 in this latter event overall performance in both the free run and unconstrained model output was poor while kge values for event 3 improved from 0 2984 to 0 151 rmse values increased from 7 21 comes free run up to 9 47 comics unconstrained in most events the volume of water in the baseflow state had been perturbed to physically inconsistent levels resulting in often elevated streamflow forecasts over the prediction interval mass constraints did little to improve performance mass constraints were focussed on ensuring non negativity of state volumes and capping soil storage to saturation capacity capacity constraints were more difficult to apply to the throughflow interflow and baseflow states without more detailed information on the potential volume of water these states could hold an upper limit was therefore not imposed in one event event 1 fig 4 performance was significantly degraded compared to the standard implementation of the enkf in this event and events 2 and 3 modelled streamflow no filter shows no hydrologic response to input rainfall indicating that this driving data may not have been representative of catchment wide rainfall at that time kge values for the unconstrained and mass constrained model output was poor 0 6280 and 0 8349 respectively with rmse values also showing significant departure from the observations in both cases unconstrained rmse 11 47 cumecs mass constrained rmse 13 55 cumecs fig 7 shows the state innovations upper from unconstrained implementation of the enkf with the corresponding state volumes lower leading up to and following the event compared to the free run similar output is evident for the mass constrained model output fig 8 in both cases perturbations leading up to the event were high pushing the baseflow state volume to considerable volumes while interflow and throughflow states remained low this resulted in an elevated streamflow response over the forecast two day period compared to the observations although the output was similar between the unconstrained and mass constrained output there was more bias in the latter reducing overall model performance adding flux constraints caused no significant degradation in any of eight analysed and significantly improved model performance in six compared to the unconstrained and mass constrained model output for example the event on 25 november 2008 event 2 fig 4 average kge values over the five parameter sets increased from 0 109 unconstrained and 0 135 mass constrained up to 0 466 when flux constraints were added flux constraints also improved rmse values reducing to 3 02 cumecs from 7 15 cumecs unconstrained and 7 32 cumecs mass constrained similar results are seen in events 1 5 and 8 event 6 fig 5 also shows a significant improvement kge 0 632 when flux constraints were added compared to the unconstrained kge 0 026 and mass constrained kge 0 002 model output but was not significantly different to the free run due to smaller differences in the rmse which was 4 41 cumecs and 5 41 cumecs respectively the absolute difference between these is below 10 of the mean observed streamflow for the event and therefore considered to show no significant difference in performance in the event on 16 december 2008 event 3 although significantly improved modelled streamflow has a steeper recession compared to the observations into the second day of the forecast period fig 9 shows time series of the four state volumes over the event for the three enkf implementations compared to the free run soil storage throughflow and interflow state volumes are relatively similar between the free run unconstrained and mass constrained output with significant differences only to the baseflow state conversely flux constraints which are more focussed on the baseflow state tend to keep baseflow volumes more consistent over the period but are generally lower than the other filtered and free run model outputs large and sudden increases are reduced to compensate interflow and throughflow state volumes and perturbations to these states tend to be higher than the unconstrained and mass constrained model output consequently during recession periods modelled streamflow shows a steeper recession limb than in the observations this could indicate too much restriction is being placed on the baseflow state and further consideration of constraints is needed to better represent other factors such as seasonal differences wet dry periods or saturation levels in cases where the free run shows very little response e g events 1 2 3 the unconstrained and mass constrained model output is not able to simulate observed streamflow in the early stages of the event as noted in section 3 the relative difference in error between the model and observations determine the weights calculated in the kalman gain eq 10 in these events the measurement error is large compared to the model error restricting the model s ability to match the observations however when flux constraints are added the model is drawn toward the observations given the measurement error is unchanged it is assumed that the constraints placed on the enkf to ensure greater physical consistency in model states have reduced the relative error between the model and the measurement drawing the filter closer to the observations whether these states truly are more representative requires further detailed investigation however the results are encouraging and demonstrate that mass constraints alone are not be enough for robust and reliable streamflow forecasting and decision making purposes 4 conclusions and recommendations it is clear from this work that flux constraints in conjunction with more commonly applied mass constraints can improve the reliability of streamflow predictions constraints were applied during ensemble generation to ensure possible model trajectories were physically consistent eight events were selected for analysis the majority of which relate to flux and volume perturbations to the baseflow state mass constraints are often applied to ensure for example non negativity of model states but flux constraints which control the rate of water movement to from ensembles states within physical boundaries are generally not considered we show that without flux constraints the integrity of model output is often compromised mass constraints alone did little to improve forecast performance compared to the unconstrained and free run model outputs large adjustments to the model states could still be made leading to significant bias in the forward prediction removing such biases is particularly important for real time forecasting where accurate and reliable forecasts are required and there is limited opportunity for interrogating model output before decisions must be made filter performance is also dependent on the appropriate specification of model and observation errors while this is not a new idea in practice the importance of the observation error has been largely ignored there may be significant trade offs between specifying an observation error that best represents our knowledge of that specific error including measurement interpretation and representativeness versus one that gives an appropriate level of freedom to update innovations there are potentially more severe implications for other applications where assimilated data may be more or less uncertain e g soil moisture groundwater levels philosophically the specification of an observation error that reflects known instrumental or other uncertainties is clearly desirable and intuitively should lead to appropriate perturbations assuming the model error is similarly specified correctly which as thiboult and anctil 2015 note is generally not possible to identify however the insertion of a full range of observational uncertainty into the enkf clearly causes artefacts that can compromise forecast accuracy it is possible that part of the issue is that we are not considering autocorrelation or other structural information about our errors for example it is very unlikely that the error in a streamflow observation would jump from being extremely positively biased to being extremely negatively biased over the time period of a single assimilation another issue arises from the co dependence of the filter accuracy on specification of model error observational error and other hyper parameters as highlighted in the very recent study by thiboult and anctil 2015 further work to improve the specification and quantification of these uncertainties that give consideration to these issues could significantly advance the operational use of data assimilation in hydrology and lead to more

7334,data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf are often applied to hydrological models with minimal state volume capacity constraints enforced during ensemble generation flux constraints are rarely if ever applied consequently model states can be adjusted beyond physically reasonable limits compromising the integrity of model output in this paper we investigate the effect of constraining the enkf on forecast performance a free run in which no assimilation is applied is compared to a completely unconstrained enkf implementation a typical hydrological implementation in which mass constraints are enforced to ensure non negativity and capacity thresholds of model states are not exceeded and then to a more tightly constrained implementation where flux as well as mass constraints are imposed to force the rate of water movement to from ensemble states to be within physically consistent boundaries a three year period 2008 2010 was selected from the available data record 1976 2010 this was specifically chosen as it had no significant data gaps and represented well the range of flows observed in the longer dataset over this period the standard implementation of the enkf no constraints contained eight hydrological events where multiple physically inconsistent state adjustments were made all were selected for analysis mass constraints alone did little to improve forecast performance in fact several were significantly degraded compared to the free run in contrast the combined use of mass and flux constraints significantly improved forecast performance in six events relative to all other implementations while the remaining two events showed no significant difference in performance placing flux as well as mass constraints on the data assimilation framework encourages physically consistent state estimation and results in more accurate and reliable forward predictions of streamflow for robust decision making we also experiment with the observation error which has a profound effect on filter performance we note an interesting tension exists between specifying an error which reflects known uncertainties and errors in the measurement versus an error that allows optimal filter updating keywords constrained ensemble kalman filter data assimilation observation error hydrology 1 introduction and scope the use of data assimilation through state estimation is increasingly recognised as an essential part of any hydrological forecasting application liu et al 2012 without it relatively large errors can accumulate in the model output even over the short term i e hours to days collischonn et al 2007 state estimation methods use observations to adjust model states by taking account of errors in both the observation s and the model clark et al 2008 reichle 2008 salamon and feyen 2009 vrugt et al 2005 with the aim to reduce errors associated with the data and model structure and improve the physical realism of the model output one of the most common state estimation methods used in hydrology is the ensemble kalman filter enkf the enkf utilises monte carlo methods to generate an ensemble of model trajectories consistent with the main sources of uncertainty in the given problem although some calibration or fine tuning of relevant error specification is necessary for optimal filter performance noh et al 2014 and most applications would ensure some physical consistency e g non negativity of sub surface states application of the standard enkf does not necessarily require the ensemble of model states to be within physically realistic limits consequently states can be perturbed to unrealistic and inconsistent values to obtain a closer match to the observations which can lead to erratic streamflow simulations clark et al 2008 unrealistic perturbations can be particularly severe when modelled streamflow is significantly different to observed streamflow although a high observation error term will limit the severity of fluctuations as we note later weerts and el serafy 2006 contend that error specification should be given due consideration while error settings which allow large perturbations can increase the possibility of successful forecasting we argue that it is not realistic to allow unjustified perturbations which can subsequently compromise the accuracy and reliability of forward predictions to address this issue constraints can be applied to ensure physical limits are not exceeded constraints have been widely applied in oceanic and atmospheric applications janjic et al 2014 simon and simon 2006 simon and tien li 2002 thacker 2007 in hydrologic modelling states generally represent some component of water storage for example groundwater and soil water storage these should be non negative and where possible have some maximum capacity constraint constraints can be imposed in a number of ways wang et al 2009 compared the naive projection and accept reject methods for incorporating constraints into the enkf non negativity constraints were applied to five state variables three quick flow states one baseflow state and soil water content and a capacity constraint to ensure the soil state does not exceed maximum soil water content in dual state parameter estimation approaches moradkhani et al 2005 shi et al 2014 wang et al 2009 predefined ranges are used to bound the ensemble generation to ensure non negative volumes pan and wood 2006 and li et al 2012 add mass conservation constraints to ensure closure of the water balance for land surface modelling checking for physical realism or consistent model behaviour is often recommended clark et al 2008 xie et al 2014 although little specific guidance is provided on how to avoid model behaviour violating physical laws few studies constrain the perturbations themselves the danger of forecasting streamflow using unconstrained flux perturbations as the only innovations to states has been demonstrated lee et al 2011 samuel et al 2014 seo et al 2009 however rather than searching for ways to further constrain the state estimation procedure these studies focussed on showing how assimilating soil moisture as well as streamflow could improve analysis and forecast performance it is often the case however that soil moisture and other state information is not readily available so streamflow may be the only obtainable variable that can be closely related to model states moradkhani et al 2005 and abaza et al 2014 apply proportionality factors to ensure the generated ensemble spread is within a meaningful range clark et al 2008 and subsequently mcmillan et al 2013 and xie et al 2014 impose fractional factors to allow larger model errors when model fluxes are large and smaller model errors when fluxes are small while their approach does not account for periods where the model inadequately simulates large model fluxes or where these fluxes are missed clark et al 2008 it does address the temporal variability of the error which is more representative of the nature of model errors and leads to improved forecast performance a large source of uncertainty lies in the forcing data e g precipitation and evapotranspiration due to the difficulty in fully representing the spatial and temporal variability of these inputs in the model the ability to provide accurate estimates of forcing uncertainty would help to understand and identify other sources of error and uncertainty in the model mcmillan et al 2011 and can lead to more reliable and successful data assimilation as shown in noh et al 2014 rakovec et al 2012 and weerts and el serafy 2006 amongst others a number of studies have specifically investigated the effect of perturbing forcing with few studies specifically considering constraining model states in the assimilation process while the focus of this paper is on the latter an important next step is to combine methodologies for perturbing forcing with constraints on state innovations examining both the question of whether the combination improves model performance and the question of whether inconsistencies in predictive outputs and state innovations can point to ways to improve specification of both input error definition and state constraints in summary although the importance of plausible state updating has been acknowledged in the literature the implications of inadequate constraint of the enkf on the reliability of forward streamflow predictions have not been demonstrated in any detail in addition although the sensitivity of the enkf to the specified measurement error has been noted strategies to overcome this have focussed on bringing in supplementary data rather than exploring methods to allow more robust state updating where streamflow observations remain the only obtainable measure while the use of basic non negativity and or capacity constraints is not uncommon this is the first study to specifically investigate the effect of also imposing flux constraints controlling the rate of water movement to or from ensemble model states on the accuracy and reliability of forecast streamflow we compare three approaches 1 a naïve enkf approach in which no constraints are applied to model output 2 an arguably more typical approach in hydrology where mass constraints are enforced to ensure non negativity and capacity thresholds where possible of model states are not exceeded and 3 our new further constrained approach where flux constraints are imposed in conjunction with the more typical mass constraints so that state perturbations as well as state extremes are kept within physically realistic ranges the three approaches are demonstrated using a lumped conceptual hydrological model maxwell 2013 in the tauranga taupo catchment new zealand streamflow observations are used to update four soil storage throughflow interflow and baseflow model states it is shown that mass constraints alone are not sufficient to significantly improve forecast performance in the majority of events analysed the combination of mass and flux constraints results in more reliable forecasting of streamflow compared to the standard and mass constrained enkf implementations the implications for the accuracy and reliability of model predictions are demonstrated we also experiment with the observation error term in the calculation of the kalman gain often paid little attention in the literature this term has a profound effect on filter performance as further discussed in crow and van loon 2006 and reichle 2008 very high confidence in the observations relative to the model draws the filter rapidly toward the observations by allowing larger perturbations to model states on the other hand specifying a large measurement error will give greater weight to the model preventing significant perturbations and drawing the filter toward an outcome similar to the model output from the free run despite these previous authors having noted this tension most studies simply note this term should reflect the accuracy of the measurement instrument processing and representativeness evensen 2003 mcmillan et al 2013 xie and zhang 2010 with little consideration given to its subsequent impact on filter performance we found interesting conflicts between a realistic specification of the error and its impact on the filter s ability to constrain state adjustments the hydrological model data used catchment area calibration procedure implementation of the constrained enkf and experimental set up is described in section 2 the results are discussed in section 3 and include a comparative analysis of model performance over the eight events between 2008 and 2010 we conclude with a summary of the main findings and suggest areas for future work 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data the tauranga taupo catchment fig 1 covers 197 km2 and drains an area of impermeable sedimentary basement greywacke geology in its headwaters and more permeable volcanic lithologies in its lower reaches it has a mean flow of 12 2 m3 s based on predominantly sub hourly observations between 1976 and 2009 it is primarily covered in forestry and has predominantly volcanic soils which are generally free draining with considerable water holding capacity molloy 1998 rainfall has been recorded at te kono road site no 960010 since 1976 observed data from this site was used and a multiplier parameterised as part of the calibration process applied to ensure a reasonable water balance missing values are infilled using the normal ratio method using the nearest gauge which has a high hourly correlation to the te kono road station potential evapotranspiration pe computed from atmospheric observations recorded at turangi site no 25643 is used to drive the model missing values are replaced with the mean daily pe for the month in question this daily pe data was disaggregated into hourly data by approximating the diurnal cycle of direct radiation corrected for periods with high relative humidity 90 and minimal mean global radiation inputs to the model are assumed perfect although it is noted that an error term could be added to these inputs as part of the modelling and or assimilation process model simulations were forced with fifteen minute interpolated rainfall and hourly pe data 2 2 conceptual hydrologic model the lumped conceptual model used in this study is described below further details of its development and rationale can be found in maxwell 2013 the structure is similar to many accepted conceptual models in that it uses a number of storage elements representing important flowpaths in the catchment each of these stores is connected by mathematical functions describing their respective storage and depletion the time delay between system inputs and the timing of the response observed at the gauge is accounted for through the lag time parameterised as part of the calibration process a soil moisture accounting module partitions input rainfall into evapotranspiration storage and runoff rainfall not lost to evaporation infiltrates the soil where it is readily available for plant water use hence transpiring at the potential evaporation rate down to a critical point below which it becomes difficult to extract actual evapotranspiration below this point is reduced proportionally to the volume of water in the soil in situations where the maximum infiltration rate or the soils maximum saturation capacity are exceeded overland flow is generated subsurface drainage occurs once the soil has reached field capacity catchment average soil water content is modelled and includes areas which have reached saturation earlier than other areas to account for this some drainage is allowed to occur between a minimum soil water content threshold and a catchment wide field capacity value drawing on the concept of a variable source area see hewlett and hibbert 1967 dunne and black 1970 and references therein drainage is calculated as a fraction of the infiltrated rainfall given the proportion of the catchment under saturation steenhuis et al 1995 water from the soil layer is released into three linear stores throughflow interflow and baseflow these stores represent different pathways in which water can move through the subsurface each store has a specific residence time associated with it throughflow is the quickest pathway and baseflow the slowest with interflow somewhere in between the volume of water entering each store is determined by multiplying the amount of water draining the soil layer by the parameterised relative proportion for each store the new volume of water in the soil and the three sub surface stores are calculated by adding the amount of water draining into the store at the current time step to the store volume at the previous time step and subtracting any losses to runoff these losses are determined by dividing the store volume by the respective store residence times the relative contributions of flow from the respective stores and any overland flow that may have occurred are combined to determine total runoff direct rainfall to and evaporative losses from the river itself are assumed negligible 2 3 model calibration model calibration was undertaken over a five year period between 1 june 2003 and 31 may 2008 using average hourly streamflow values this period was selected because it had an uninterrupted rainfall record inspection of flow duration curves also indicated that this period included a representative range of the streamflow experienced over the entire record 40 years missing only the most extreme peak flood observations rainfall and streamflow records were also consistent with regard to residual mass curves which show the cumulative departures between mean annual rainfall and mean annual streamflow over the period classic monte carlo sampling was used to randomly generate parameter sets from a feasible and pre defined parameter space table 1 gives details on the thirteen parameters calibrated and associated parameter ranges minimum and maximum parameter values were selected based on an analysis of relationships between catchment physical and hydrologic attributes the parameter space is sampled using a uniform distribution chosen due to its simplicity and because we had no a priori reasons to give any particular part of the parameter space more or less weighting than the rest one million calibrations were obtained although this is more extensive than is often achievable it still cannot comprehensively sample the entire parameter space given the number of parameters to be calibrated table 1 this number of calibrations was selected to provide a balance between statistical accuracy and computational constraints each simulation generates a parameter set the performance of which is described by an objective function or goodness of fit measure the compiled matlab code was submitted into a batch processing environment comprising sgi c2112 compute nodes each node having 2x amd opeteron 6174 12 core cpus and 64 gb memory 1 original interactive matlab codebase was compiled using the matlab compiler to allow for submission into a batch processing environment vuw s science faculty high performance computing facility comprising sgi c2112 computer nodes each node having 2x amd opeteron 6174 12 core cpus and 64 gb memory which uses son of grid engine sge as the local resource manager lrm 1 model performance was evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency index kge gupta et al 2009 a weighted decomposition of the commonly used nash sutcliffe efficiency index the kge is written 1 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the correlation between simulated and observed flows the quantity α is a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β represents the overall bias ratio between the mean simulated and mean observed flows the kge is applied in this study because it was able to generate parameter sets which provide a better representation of the hydrological response characteristics in the tauranga taupo catchment than the more commonly used nash sutcliffe efficiency index maxwell 2013 a multi criteria approach is used in which the fit to the time series and fit to the flow duration curve is evaluated the five best performing parameter sets which are able to sufficiently simulate the hydrograph response in terms of timing of response and recession characteristics fit to the time series while also adequately capturing the variability and range of flow for the catchment fit to the flow duration curve are retained with the model output from all five used to account for parametric uncertainty all five parameter sets are used in each of the enkf strategies outlined in section 4 and the output from each used in the analysis of performance with this approach we were able to demonstrate the importance of accounting for parametric uncertainty as one of the five parameters did not perform as well as the other four refer section 4 although we recognise that a convergence study may be useful to ascertain the optimal number of parameter sets to retain this was not the major objective of the study and is therefore recommended as an area of future research kge values for the five selected parameter sets were between 0 905 and 0 907 for the fit to the time series ts and 0 980 to 0 988 for the fit to the flow duration curve fdc over the evaluation period 1 june 2008 to 1 august 2011 kge values for these parameter sets were lower ts 0 799 0 804 and fdc 0 833 0 840 but still showed good agreement lag times in this catchment parameterised as part of the calibration process ranged between 3 75 h and 4 75 h 2 4 the constrained ensemble kalman filter 2 4 1 the enkf algorithm the enkf is a two step sequential data assimilation routine which uses monte carlo methods to generate an ensemble of model states errors in the model and observations are quantified a priori and the relative error used as weights to update model states through the kalman gain matrix in the forecast step f the updated model states from the previous time step are propagated forward until time t the state vectors x t f i with i varying between 1 and nens combine to become an nstate x nens matrix χ t f where nstate is the number of states nens is the number of ensemble members 2 χ t f x t f 1 x t f nens in this study where a lumped conceptual model is applied the background 4 100 matrix is made up of the four model states baseflow interflow throughflow and soil storage and 100 ensemble members selected as a balance between statistical robustness and computational efficiency so that the matrix becomes 3 χ t f x t f 1 ss x t f 100 ss x t f 1 tf x t f 100 tf x t f 1 if x t f 100 if x t f 1 bf x t f 100 bf where ss tf if and bf represent the soil storage throughflow interflow and baseflow states respectively since the true state is not known the mean of the ensemble x is assumed to be a best estimate of the actual state truth where 4 x t f 1 nens i 1 nens x t f i where i is the i th ensemble member and the spread of the ensemble members around the mean representing the error variance is 5 e x t f x t f 1 x t f x t f nens x t f the output from the model y given the ensemble of model states is the model equivalent of the observation with a mean of y and forecast error statistics e y t b 6 y t f 1 nens i 1 nens y t f i 7 e y t f y t f 1 y t f y t f nens y t f the relationship between the relative uncertainties between the model states and model output is described by error covariances assuming gaussian error statistics the model error covariance is computed directly so that 8 c xy t f 1 nens 1 e x t f e y t f t 9 c yy t f 1 nens 1 e y t f e y t f t where c xy t f is the forecasted cross covariance of modelled states and modelled streamflow c yy t f is the forecasted output error covariance and t denotes the matrix transposition in the analysis step the model states are related t0 discharge observations in the calculation of the kalman gain κ t the kalman gain is a weight matrix describing the relative uncertainties of model states and observations determined by the error covariances obtained in the forecast step it reflects the amount of confidence in the model compared to the observations and is written 10 κ t c xy t f c yy t f r 1 where r represents the observation error covariance matrix i e σ 2 see below observation errors are assumed uncorrelated implying that r reduces to a diagonal matrix where each diagonal term corresponds to the error variance for each observation the update step then becomes 11 x t a i x t f i κ t y t i h x t f i where x t a i is the updated model state matrix y i the streamflow observations and h is the observation operator used to equate the model equivalent of the observations in this application the same hydrological model is used to both map the model inputs to the states forward model operator and to relate modelled states to the observations observation operator as such y t f i essentially becomes the model output given the ensemble of model states that is 12 h x t f i y t f i since there is only one monitoring point the four states are related to one observation at each assimilation time step observations are assimilated at fifteen minute intervals to map the observations into state space the observation is compared to the modelled unrouted discharge a number of time steps behind allowing for the time it takes for the input to the system to reach the outlet in this application calibrated catchment lag times are used for this comparison 2 4 2 sensitivity to the observation error the observations are not considered perfect and are treated as random variables with a mean of the actual observation and the variance representing the measurement error this measurement error ε t i is often unknown so a parallel assimilation cycle is run where i is the number of ensembles so that 13 y t i y t ε t i where the ε t i is generated as a gaussian random variable with a zero mean normal distribution and a variance of σ 2 modelled as a percentage of the observed streamflow value filter performance is sensitive to the specification of σ crow and van loon 2006 while the observation error is known to have a considerable impact on filter performance it is often given little attention in the hydrological literature most studies simply note this term should reflect the accuracy of the measurement instrument processing and representativeness streamflow observations are commonly considered to have measurement errors of 5 15 abaza et al 2014 dechant and moradkhani 2012 li et al 2015 although it is noted that the error is likely to be larger at higher stage levels compared to periods of lower streamflow clark et al 2008 however an interesting tension arises between specifying an appropriate measurement error based on known measurement interpretation and representativeness of the observation and optimal filter adjustment we investigate the impact of different error levels on enkf results by varying the observation error and comparing model output to the observations 2 4 3 specification of physical constraints in hydrology it is often the case that the enkf is implemented with little restriction placed on how the ensemble of model states is generated during the forecast step in these cases states can be adjusted to beyond what is physically possible ensembles are generated by stochastically perturbing model states these perturbations aim to reflect the uncertainty associated with the model parameters and structure clark et al 2008 however this uncertainty is notoriously difficult to quantify and in the absence of other knowledge it is common to assume a normally or uniformly distributed error with zero mean for e g clark et al 2008 thiboult and anctil 2015 in this study state perturbations are realised from a normally distributed random distribution using a standard deviation of 5 of the state volumes as thiboult and anctil 2015 note more scrutiny is needed to define reasonable variances we then investigate the effect of constraining the data assimilation framework through adding mass and flux constraints to both state volumes and state perturbations on forecast performance mass constraints ensure states are non negative and do not exceed capacity they are applied before the forecast step keeping only those ensembles which do not violate non negativity and capacity constraints if constraints are violated ensemble members continue to be drawn until 100 members that satisfy all the specified state constraints are obtained for the soil storage state a constraint is applied based on the saturation capacity of the soil given the difficulty in obtaining volume capacities of sub surface baseflow interflow and throughflow states they do not have an upper limit on their volumes imposed so that 14 x t a tf 0 15 x t a if 0 16 x t a bf 0 17 0 x t a ss v ss sat where x t a ss x t a tf x t a if x t a bf are the updated soil storage throughflow interflow and baseflow states at time t respectively and v ss sat is the saturation capacity of the soil obtained from model calibration flux constraints are also applied prior to the forecast step during ensemble generation and relate to the rate of movement to from each of the four model states and could be designed to vary according to the time of the year antecedent conditions or state volumes in this study perturbations are randomly generated with a standard deviation of one third the maximum state volume change simulated in the free run model output over the 1998 2010 evaluation period this was deemed appropriate since 1998 2010 period reflected the same range of streamflow over the much longer 1976 2010 period for which observations have been recorded the perturbations can therefore be written 18 ρ t ss i 1 3 max δ ss 19 ρ t tf i 1 3 max δ tf 20 ρ t if i 1 3 max δ if 21 ρ t bf i 1 3 max δ bf where ρ t ss i ρ t tf i ρ t if i and ρ t bf i are the perturbations to the soil storage throughflow interflow and baseflow states respectively and max δ ss max δ tf max δ if and max δ bf is the maximum state volume change respectively as specified above perturbations to the baseflow state also depend on the amount of water held in the store the baseflow state can hold considerably more water than the soil storage throughflow and interflow states small changes in its volume can have a significant impact on streamflow therefore as the volume of water in this state increases the amplitude of the perturbation allowed is reduced so that 22 0 v t bf 100 2 max δ bf ρ t bf i 2 max δ bf 23 100 v t bf 200 max δ bf ρ t bf i max δ bf 24 0 v t bf 100 0 5 max δ bf ρ t bf i 0 5 max δ bf where v t bf is the baseflow state volume at time t and ρ t bf i is the baseflow state perturbation at time t for the ith ensemble member the basis for this is that the amount of water routed to the stream from each state is proportional to its volume the more water in the state the larger amount of water contributing to runoff likewise a large perturbation during saturated conditions higher volume will allow a more significant change in streamflow than the same perturbation in drier conditions lower volume in both the soil storage and throughflow states perturbations are further constrained after periods of no rainfall water moves through these states relatively quickly so it is unlikely that there would be significant positive changes in volume of these states as they get progressively drier without further input from rainfall in this study if there has been no rain in 12 h perturbations are capped to a maximum of 5 of the two state s volumes allowing only small positive perturbations or more extensive negative perturbations to be made so that and 25 ρ t ss i 0 5 x v t ss i mm and ρ t tf i 0 5 x v t tf i where v ss is the soil storage state volume and ρ ss and ρ tf are the perturbations to the soil storage and throughflow states respectively outside of dry periods the amplitude of the perturbations to the soil storage throughflow and interflow states are kept the same over the entire period irrespective of volume as these states have generally much lower storage capacity than the baseflow state and not the same volumetric limits as the soil storage state the same degree of control on the constraints was deemed unnecessary for the purpose of this study it may be beneficial to adjust constraints depending on the time of year or wet dry periods however care must be taken to ensure some flexibility remains too many constraints may significantly increase computational burden resulting in the assimilation routine unable to find a suitable solution within the short timeframes needed for operational forecasting 2 5 experimental setup to investigate the effect of constraining the enkf we compare the output from four model simulations in the first no assimilation is applied free run the second model run applied an unconstrained implementation of the enkf mass constraints relating to non negativity and any capacity constraints are applied in the third model run with mass plus flux constraints in the fourth the output from all four experiments are compared and analysed in all experiments all four states are updated at each assimilation step given the lag in the system we cannot assume that any of the four state volumes and fluxes should not be modified at any one time step however as specified in the previous section the perturbations to state volumes and fluxes are constrained based on a series of rules relating to the amount of water in the state and whether there has been any rain in the preceding period event selection is based on the output of the unconstrained enkf a physically inconsistent adjustment to a model state is defined as a flux and volume which exceeds twice the maximum absolute flux or volume of the state in the free run model output over the 1998 2010 period table 2 these thresholds are deemed large enough to account for the possibility of more extreme events occurring in the catchment outside of those experienced over the 1998 2010 period the only exception is the soil storage state which has a modelled physical threshold equal to the saturation capacity of the soil defined by calibrated model parameters of the 53 hydrological events 2 for the purpose of this study a hydrological event is defined as those times during which streamflow exceeded the 20 percentile of streamflow based on the flow duration curve for the catchment events were distinguished by whether streamflow receded to below the average flow and whether rainfall was zero for at least 24 h 2 that occurred over the 2008 2010 period perturbation and or flux constraints were violated in eight 15 these hydrological events tended to occur during high streamflow events top 20 of streamflow values arguably a time when accurate streamflow forecasts are most important one parameter set violated constraints three times more frequently than the other four parameter sets suggesting that this set may be less reliable analysis of assimilation innovations could be used to subsequently inform further refinement of parameter sets to reduce bias and improve model calibration and structural evaluation maxwell 2013 further investigation of this issue was outside of the scope of this paper but is recommended as an area of future work for the purpose of this study the starting point from which the forecast performance is analysed for each of the eight events is randomly chosen from only those time steps within the event in which constraints were violated in at least three of the five parameter sets although all five parameter sets were kept for analysis seven of the eight events were related to perturbations to the baseflow state with the remaining event associated with perturbations to the interflow state table 3 defined thresholds were not exceeded at any time during the period for the soil storage and throughflow states forecast model streamflow for each event was compared against the forecast model output from the assimilation run with no constraints performance was assessed over a two day forecast period using the kge described in section 2 3 however it was apparent the normalisation by the range of streamflow values over the forecast period could lead to under reporting of performance by the kge particularly in periods of low streamflow where the relative difference may be considerable but the absolute difference may be significantly less conversely it is also possible that the kge over reports performance in high flow events to overcome this an absolute measure of performance was considered in the evaluation the root mean square error rmse is an aggregate measure of the magnitude of error between the model output and the observations and gives higher weight to larger errors it can be written 26 rmse j 1 n x obs j x mod j 2 n where x obs j is the j th observation x mod j is the corresponding j th model output and n is the number of paired data points model output within 0 025 of the kge or its components was deemed to show little difference between the constrained and unconstrained model output those that were 0 025 were considered improved and those 0 025 were considered degraded as long as the absolute difference was also greater i e rmse 10 of the observed mean where observations below 1o comes are given a threshold of 1 comics 3 results and discussion table 4 shows the root mean square error rmse of the modelled streamflow for each parameter set between 2008 and 2010 as a function of the standard deviation of the observation error the error levels range between 0 1 through to 5 the latter being at the lower end of the typical streamflow measurement errors noted previously as the standard deviation increases the rmse becomes larger there are minimal differences between the modelled streamflow and the observations with a very small observation error for our specific study a realistic amount of error gave a restrictively low weight to the observations in the calculation of the kalman gain compromising the filters ability to update model states at times to values that allow predictions to become consistent with observations fig 2 a as the measurement error increases the weight given to the observations in determining the kalman gain is reduced reichle 2008 this effectively over constrains the filter shifting the model toward the free run model output crow and van loon 2006 conversely too small an error can give too much weight to the measurements drawing the model toward the observations fig 2d more confidence in the observations allows larger gains to be made but also results in more erratic perturbations which is demonstrated by the number of constraint violations at this error level compared to higher standard deviations a problem that can be partially rectified by applying sensible flux constraints as our study demonstrates table 5 we therefore argue that a balance between a realistic amount of observational error and optimal filter updating is needed this may also be particularly important for other applications where more uncertain measurements such as soil moisture or groundwater volumes are assimilated for the main part of this study comparison of event performance as filter constraints vary σ is defined as 1 of the observed streamflow value this implies a larger error at time of higher discharge model output from the free run unconstrained mass constrained and mass plus flux constrained assimilation routines were compared over the 2008 2010 period fig 3 table 6 shows the average kge and rmse values for each event analysed both averaged over the model output from the five parameter sets used the free run fig 3a shows some significant bias while the free run model can track recession periods relatively well during this period there are some inconsistences during significant hydrological events in which peak streamflow is not adequately represented the enkf is able to reduce this bias and effect a closer match to reality especially when flux constraints fig 3d are applied the noticeable jumps in streamflow simulations during some recession periods seen in fig 3d are likely to be a result of particularly inaccurate precipitation forcing with the constraints to state fluxes imposed it can be difficult for the assimilation routine to adjust model states to a level consistent with the observations appropriate perturbations of the precipitation input may help to avoid such issues but large discrepancies are generally caused by autocorrelation and spatial representativeness issues which are rarely built into our error models implementing the enkf without constraint fig 3b or with mass constraints only fig 3c also appears to improve performance compared to the free run however in these cases state adjustments were often found to lack any physical realism the eight events selected for analysis are examples of this and show the implications for reliable streamflow forecasting at these times the effect of constraining the enkf on streamflow predictions over a two day forecast period is shown for all eight events in figs 4 and 5 in general compared to the free run model output with no filter the standard unconstrained implementation of the enkf did little to improve forecast performance with a marked deterioration evident in four events and significant improvement in just one event 3 fig 6 in this latter event overall performance in both the free run and unconstrained model output was poor while kge values for event 3 improved from 0 2984 to 0 151 rmse values increased from 7 21 comes free run up to 9 47 comics unconstrained in most events the volume of water in the baseflow state had been perturbed to physically inconsistent levels resulting in often elevated streamflow forecasts over the prediction interval mass constraints did little to improve performance mass constraints were focussed on ensuring non negativity of state volumes and capping soil storage to saturation capacity capacity constraints were more difficult to apply to the throughflow interflow and baseflow states without more detailed information on the potential volume of water these states could hold an upper limit was therefore not imposed in one event event 1 fig 4 performance was significantly degraded compared to the standard implementation of the enkf in this event and events 2 and 3 modelled streamflow no filter shows no hydrologic response to input rainfall indicating that this driving data may not have been representative of catchment wide rainfall at that time kge values for the unconstrained and mass constrained model output was poor 0 6280 and 0 8349 respectively with rmse values also showing significant departure from the observations in both cases unconstrained rmse 11 47 cumecs mass constrained rmse 13 55 cumecs fig 7 shows the state innovations upper from unconstrained implementation of the enkf with the corresponding state volumes lower leading up to and following the event compared to the free run similar output is evident for the mass constrained model output fig 8 in both cases perturbations leading up to the event were high pushing the baseflow state volume to considerable volumes while interflow and throughflow states remained low this resulted in an elevated streamflow response over the forecast two day period compared to the observations although the output was similar between the unconstrained and mass constrained output there was more bias in the latter reducing overall model performance adding flux constraints caused no significant degradation in any of eight analysed and significantly improved model performance in six compared to the unconstrained and mass constrained model output for example the event on 25 november 2008 event 2 fig 4 average kge values over the five parameter sets increased from 0 109 unconstrained and 0 135 mass constrained up to 0 466 when flux constraints were added flux constraints also improved rmse values reducing to 3 02 cumecs from 7 15 cumecs unconstrained and 7 32 cumecs mass constrained similar results are seen in events 1 5 and 8 event 6 fig 5 also shows a significant improvement kge 0 632 when flux constraints were added compared to the unconstrained kge 0 026 and mass constrained kge 0 002 model output but was not significantly different to the free run due to smaller differences in the rmse which was 4 41 cumecs and 5 41 cumecs respectively the absolute difference between these is below 10 of the mean observed streamflow for the event and therefore considered to show no significant difference in performance in the event on 16 december 2008 event 3 although significantly improved modelled streamflow has a steeper recession compared to the observations into the second day of the forecast period fig 9 shows time series of the four state volumes over the event for the three enkf implementations compared to the free run soil storage throughflow and interflow state volumes are relatively similar between the free run unconstrained and mass constrained output with significant differences only to the baseflow state conversely flux constraints which are more focussed on the baseflow state tend to keep baseflow volumes more consistent over the period but are generally lower than the other filtered and free run model outputs large and sudden increases are reduced to compensate interflow and throughflow state volumes and perturbations to these states tend to be higher than the unconstrained and mass constrained model output consequently during recession periods modelled streamflow shows a steeper recession limb than in the observations this could indicate too much restriction is being placed on the baseflow state and further consideration of constraints is needed to better represent other factors such as seasonal differences wet dry periods or saturation levels in cases where the free run shows very little response e g events 1 2 3 the unconstrained and mass constrained model output is not able to simulate observed streamflow in the early stages of the event as noted in section 3 the relative difference in error between the model and observations determine the weights calculated in the kalman gain eq 10 in these events the measurement error is large compared to the model error restricting the model s ability to match the observations however when flux constraints are added the model is drawn toward the observations given the measurement error is unchanged it is assumed that the constraints placed on the enkf to ensure greater physical consistency in model states have reduced the relative error between the model and the measurement drawing the filter closer to the observations whether these states truly are more representative requires further detailed investigation however the results are encouraging and demonstrate that mass constraints alone are not be enough for robust and reliable streamflow forecasting and decision making purposes 4 conclusions and recommendations it is clear from this work that flux constraints in conjunction with more commonly applied mass constraints can improve the reliability of streamflow predictions constraints were applied during ensemble generation to ensure possible model trajectories were physically consistent eight events were selected for analysis the majority of which relate to flux and volume perturbations to the baseflow state mass constraints are often applied to ensure for example non negativity of model states but flux constraints which control the rate of water movement to from ensembles states within physical boundaries are generally not considered we show that without flux constraints the integrity of model output is often compromised mass constraints alone did little to improve forecast performance compared to the unconstrained and free run model outputs large adjustments to the model states could still be made leading to significant bias in the forward prediction removing such biases is particularly important for real time forecasting where accurate and reliable forecasts are required and there is limited opportunity for interrogating model output before decisions must be made filter performance is also dependent on the appropriate specification of model and observation errors while this is not a new idea in practice the importance of the observation error has been largely ignored there may be significant trade offs between specifying an observation error that best represents our knowledge of that specific error including measurement interpretation and representativeness versus one that gives an appropriate level of freedom to update innovations there are potentially more severe implications for other applications where assimilated data may be more or less uncertain e g soil moisture groundwater levels philosophically the specification of an observation error that reflects known instrumental or other uncertainties is clearly desirable and intuitively should lead to appropriate perturbations assuming the model error is similarly specified correctly which as thiboult and anctil 2015 note is generally not possible to identify however the insertion of a full range of observational uncertainty into the enkf clearly causes artefacts that can compromise forecast accuracy it is possible that part of the issue is that we are not considering autocorrelation or other structural information about our errors for example it is very unlikely that the error in a streamflow observation would jump from being extremely positively biased to being extremely negatively biased over the time period of a single assimilation another issue arises from the co dependence of the filter accuracy on specification of model error observational error and other hyper parameters as highlighted in the very recent study by thiboult and anctil 2015 further work to improve the specification and quantification of these uncertainties that give consideration to these issues could significantly advance the operational use of data assimilation in hydrology and lead to more accurate and reliable forecast model outputs for more robust risk based decision making acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge mighty river power ltd national institute for water and
