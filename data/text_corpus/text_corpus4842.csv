24210,invasions by insects that become pests are an increasing problem for agriculture introductions of parasitoids from the regions of pest origin and breeding plants resistant to invasive pests can reduce the abundances and impacts of pests while providing safe sustainable alternatives to insecticides however impacts of parasitoids and plant resistance are likely to interact and the abiotic environment and in particular climate change is likely to affect these interactions here i report results from simulations with mathematical models of population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids on resistant versus susceptible plants parameterized with published results designed to test the following hypotheses 1 parasitoids can reduce abundances and frequencies of virulent aphids able to overcome plant resistance 2 temperature regime affects the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids and 3 the outcomes of these interactions vary with crop two systems were modeled the soybean aphid aphis glycines on soybean and the russian wheat aphid diuraphis noxia on wheat the parasitoids in the models are in the genus aphelinus species of which have a long association with biological control of invasive pests in the simulations with these models parasitoids reduced the abundances and on wheat the percent of virulent aphids the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids were greater in southern locations than in northern locations and the impacts on virulent aphids were greater on wheat than on soybean indeed parasitoids actually increased the frequencies of virulent aphids on soybean when only susceptible plants were present while reducing the abundance of all aphids if one accepts that comparisons of population dynamics in southern versus northern locations indicate the likely affects of climate change in the northern locations these results suggest that climate change would lead to decreased abundance and frequency of virulent aphids in northern locations keywords

literature cited in paper 1 introduction invasions of insects that become pests are an increasing problem for agriculture paini et al 2016 two management strategies introductions of parasitoids from the regions of pest origin and breeding plants resistant to invasive pests have proven effective at reducing pest abundance and impact while providing safe sustainable alternatives to insecticides cock et al 2016 smith 2005 however parasitoids and plant resistance are likely to interact in their impact on pests for reviews see bottrell et al 1998 peterson et al 2016 thomas and waage 1996 parasitoids may cause density or frequency dependent mortality of virulent herbivores that have overcome plant resistance such mortality could slow the spread and reduce the prevalence of virulence gould et al 1991 and thus support plant resistance in pest management smith 1989 furthermore resistant plants may increase the impact of parasitoids by slowing host development and thus increasing exposure time or by reducing immune responses of hosts to parasitoids on the other hand resistant plants may compromise biological control by producing toxins that affect parasitoids or by killing pests before parasitoids complete development whether plant resistance and parasitoids interact positively or negatively depends on the details of behavior ecology and genetics gould et al 1991 the abiotic environment and in particular climate change is likely to affect these interactions predictions about climate change include increases in mean temperatures and in the frequencies of extreme weather ippc 2014 divergences in the responses of hosts and parasitoids to these changes may disrupt overlaps in their temporal or spatial distributions chidawanyika et al 2019 damien and tougeron 2019 and thus cause pest outbreaks hance et al 2007 research has shown that interactions between plant resistance and aphid virulence vary with temperature chirumamilla et al 2014 randolph et al 2008 richardson 2012 as do interactions between aphids and parasitoids bernal and gonzalez 1996 frewin et al 2010 wang et al 2016 virulent biotypes of aphids have overcome resistance of some plant genotypes making previously resistant plant types susceptible to attack and resistant versus susceptible plants can affect the impact of natural enemies on herbivores particularly on avirulent versus avirulent aphids these ideas have been used to model likely outcomes of host parasitoids interactions bottrell et al 1998 gould et al 1991 thomas and waage 1996 however neither experiments nor mathematical models have been used to analyze how climate change could affect whether parasitoids would reduce the spread of virulent aphids here i report results from simulations with mathematical models of population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids on resistant versus susceptible plants parameterized with published experimental results designed to test the following hypotheses 1 parasitoids can reduce abundances and frequencies of virulent aphids able to overcome plant resistance 2 temperature regime affects the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids and 3 the outcomes of these interactions vary with crop the impact of parasitism on the interactions between plant resistance and aphid virulence and how this impact was affected by climate were modeled for two systems the soybean aphid aphis glycines matsumura on soybean and the russian wheat aphid diuraphis noxia kurdjumov hemiptera aphididae on wheat the parasitoids in the models are in the genus aphelinus hymenoptera aphelinidae species of which have a long association with biological control of invasive pests arce gomez and rumiatto 1989 cate et al 1973 clausen 1978 hopper et al 1998 raney et al 1971 sell and kuo sell 1989 for the soybean aphid i modeled the effects of parasitism by aphelinus certus jasnosh that arrived on its own in the u s soon after the soybean aphid invaded heimpel et al 2010 hopper et al 2017b 2019 for the russian wheat aphid i modeled the effects parasitism by aphelinus atriplicis kurdjumov which was introduced and established in the u s in the 1990 s to control this aphid hopper et al 1998 2017a to make predictions about the impacts of climate change i modeled dynamics under temperature regimes at the northern versus southern extremes of the geographical distributions in the u s of the aphids in the current climate avila et al 2019 venette and ragsdale 2004 the idea was to use differences in geography as a surrogate for changes in climate that are likely to emerge over time the expectation being that temperature regimes will move northward as the climate warms tuzun and stoks 2018 the overall goal was to provide information that growers can use to manage these pests with plant resistance and biological control as alternatives to insecticides to my knowledge this is the first modeling effort and indeed the first research to address the effects of crop plant resistance aphid virulence parasitoids and climate on the abundances avirulent versus virulent aphids 2 materials and methods 2 1 study systems the soybean aphid invaded the u s from asia in 2000 and has since spread to most regions where soybean is grown ragsdale et al 2004 in asia the soybean aphid seldom reaches damaging levels in part because of natural enemies liu et al 2004 miao et al 2007 in the u s the soybean aphid has become the most important pest of soybean decreasing yields and incurring large control costs kim et al 2008 ragsdale et al 2011 song and swinton 2009 current control relies on insecticides which are a major disruption in the 80 million acres where soybean is grown because insecticides were rarely used prior to the soybean aphid invasion furthermore pyrethroid resistance has developed in u s soybean aphid populations hanson et al 2017 although soybean resistance to soybean aphid has been identified aphid biotypes that can overcome this resistance already occur in the u s for review see hill et al 2017 aphelinus certus was accidentally introduced into north america and since has spread throughout much of region where the soybean aphid is a pest and this parasitoid is now attacking the aphid at high levels heimpel et al 2010 in asia a certus is frequently found parasitizing the soybean aphid and shows geographically variable host specificity although it always does well on soybean aphid hopper et al 2019 there is some evidence for population control of soybean aphid by a certus in the u s kaser and heimpel 2018 although other evidence suggests limited population level impacts miksanek and heimpel 2020 the russian wheat aphid invaded the u s from eurasia in 1986 stoetzel 1987 and has since spread to 17 western states becoming a major pest of wheat and barley morrison and peairs 1998 like the soybean aphid the russian wheat aphid is seldom a pest in eurasia where natural enemies can limit its abundance basky and hopper 2000 chen and hopper 1997 hopper et al 1995 aphelinus species are among the most important natural enemies of the russian wheat aphid in eurasia hopper et al 1998 2017a aphelinus atriplicis was collected in the caucasus region of southern russia and introduced into the u s in 1991 hopper et al 1998 and has since become one of the major natural enemies of the russian wheat aphid noma et al 2005 research has been published on the impacts of temperature on the development survival and reproduction of the soybean aphid chen et al 2017 hirano et al 1996 hough et al 2017 kikuchi et al 2018 mccornack et al 2004 richardson et al 2011 and the russian wheat aphid girma et al 1990 ma and bechinski 2008 randolph et al 2008 tazerouni et al 2013 these data along with information on geographical distributions have been used to model population dynamics and potential spread of the soybean aphid costamagna et al 2007 onstad et al 2005 whitney et al 2016 and the russian wheat aphid avila et al 2019 hughes and maywald 1990 legg and brewer 1995 nowierski et al 1995 ulrichs and hopper 2008 the genus aphelinus hymenoptera aphelinidae comprises at least 94 species noyes 2019 all of which are internal parasitoids of aphids and many of which are important in biological control hopper et al 1998 2017a 2017b aphelinus adults are small 1 mm long and weak fliers searching for hosts and mates primarily while walking fauvergue et al 1995 at 20 c aphelinus develop from oviposited eggs to third instars in 7 days when they kill and mummify their hosts christiansen weniger 1994 and adults emerge in another 10 days bernal and gonzalez 1996 frewin et al 2010 besides parasitizing aphids adult females of aphelinus paralyze and kill aphids and feed on aphid hemolymph to get nutrients amino and fatty acids for egg production and survival females 1 2 days old carry 15 mature eggs in their oviducts hopper and diers 2014 but produce many more eggs throughout their lives female of aphelinus species can parasitize 100 aphids during a median lifetime of two weeks in the laboratory 2 2 model structure for each aphid and parasitoid species mathematical models were developed for the tritrophic interactions between plant resistance aphid virulence and parasitism and model parameters were estimated from results in the literature difference equation stage structured models were used along the lines of those developed for the impact parasitoids on aphids bannerman and roitberg 2014 gebauer et al 2015 meisner et al 2014 miksanek and heimpel 2019 and other parasitoid host interactions godfray and waage 1991 hopper 1989 hopper and stark 1987 hopper and whitford 1989 i used a simple model structure with an eye towards being able to estimate model parameters from existing data or future experiments fig 1 for each system i used two aphid stages nymphs and adults and two parasitoid stages juveniles i e parasitized aphids and adult females reproductive rates of aphids depended on plant resistance aphid virulence and temperature reproductive rates of parasitoids depended on functional responses numbers parasitized versus aphid density that in turn depended on temperature development rates of aphids and parasitoids depended on plant resistance aphid virulence and temperature mortality of aphids depended on plant resistance aphid virulence parasitism and temperature juvenile parasitoids in aphids were assumed to suffer the same mortality as their aphid hosts the population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids were modeled as follows 1 n t 1 i n t i r t i h t i d n t i n t i m n t i n t i n a t i 2 h t 1 i h t i d n t i n t i m h t i h t i f a t i h t i h a t i 3 p t 1 i p t i n a t i h a t i d p t i p t i m n t i p t i 4 f t 1 i f t i s t i p t i m f t f t i d i s p t i f t i where n t i and h t i are the numbers at time t in days of nymphal and adult aphids respectively p t i and f t i are the numbers at time t of parasitoid juveniles parasitized aphids and female parasitoid adults respectively and na t i and ha t i are the numbers at time t of nymphs and aphids respectively attacked by female parasitoids all of these groups and the parameters that affect them varied with values of i from 1 to 4 which indicate combinations of virulence and resistance 1 avirulent aphids on susceptible plants 2 avirulent aphids on resistant plants 3 virulent aphids on susceptible plants and 4 virulent aphids on resistant plants aphid reproductive rate was assumed to be limited by plant carrying capacity and so reproductive rate was multiplied by the ratio of carrying capacity to the numbers of aphids on a given plant type the numbers of parasitized aphid nymphs na and adults ha were modeled as a type ii functional reponse holling 1959 as follows 5 n a t i f t i n t i n t i h t i a n t i 1 a h n t i 6 h a t i f t i h t i n t i h t i a h t i 1 a h h t i search rate a and handling time h were estimated from non linear regressions of the numbers parasitized versus host density in r r core team 2020 for models that included both resistant and susceptible plants a fraction of parasitoids disp were assumed to move between resistant and susceptible plants each day the dispersing parasitoids were distributed among the plant types in proportion to the relative abundance of aphids on that type thus if the aphids were equally abundant on both plant types the dispersing parasitoids would be distributed equally on each type but if all the aphids where on one plant type all the dispersing parasitoids would be allocated to that type the population models and the regressions of temperature response norms of parameters were coded in r r core team 2020 document s1 in supplementary material parameter definitions are given in table 1 and regression coefficients for the relationships between parameter values and temperature for wheat are in table 2 and those for soybean in table 3 plots of the response norms are shown in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2 2 3 parameter estimation effects of temperature plant resistance and aphid virulence soybean resistance aphid virulence and temperature have been shown to affect soybean aphid development reproduction and mortality chirumamilla et al 2014 hough et al 2017 mccornack et al 2004 richardson 2012 richardson et al 2011 data from these studies were used to generate regression equations for the effects of temperature on these rates for susceptible versus resistant plants because the effects of temperature were non linear quadratic equations were used although if rates became negative in the simulations they were set to zero in research on avirulent sba1 versus virulent aphids sba2 and 3 at 14 21 and 28 c chirumamilla et al 2014 found no interaction between temperature and biotype or between temperature biotype and resistance in their effects on aphid population growth however resistance and biotype interacted such that the virulent biotype was as abundant on plants with the rag1 resistance gene as susceptible plants but the avirulent biotype was much less abundant on plants with the rag1 resistance gene than on susceptible plants thus in the simulations here virulent aphids were assumed to have similar rates of development reproduction and mortality on susceptible versus resistant plants and that these rates matched those of avirulent aphids on susceptible plants however the effect of this assumption was tested in sensitivity analyses using an alternative assumption that there was a cost to virulence through increase mortality of virulent nymphs on susceptible plants although numbers of aphids parasitized by binodoxys communis hymenoptera braconidae were lower on resistant versus susceptible soybean chacon et al 2012 ghising et al 2012 parasitism by a atriplicis misidentified as aphelinus albipodus did not differ between susceptible versus resistant wheat brewer et al 1998 farid et al 1998 some studies have shown reduced survival longer development time and smaller size for parasitoids aphidius colemani binodoxys communis on resistant plants ballman et al 2012 ghising et al 2012 ode and crompton 2013 in previous research soybean aphids on plants with rag1 or rag2 resistance did not differ in oviposition by a glycinis or a certus hopper and diers 2014 rag1 had no effect on the number of aphids mummified by a certus but rag2 reduced the number of aphids mummied four fold and both rag1 and rag2 reduced the number of aphids mummified by a glycinis two fold in preliminary experiments i have measured the effects of plant resistance and aphid biotype on parasitism of the soybean aphid by a certus unpublished data for soybean i used the ld14 8003 which is resistant in three gene regions rag1 rag2 and rag3 and ld14 8007 which is susceptible in the same three regions for soybean aphid i used the avirulent biotype sba1 which produces lower numbers of progeny on plants with resistance in any of these regions and the virulent biotype sba4 whose reproduction is not affected by resistance in these regions the results of these experiments are preliminary and larger sample sizes are needed but median parasitism was higher for the virulent biotype on both resistant and susceptible plants for a glycinis and a certus the difference was greatest for virulent versus avirulent aphids on resistant plants with a certus this is the sort of density dependent parasitism that may slow the spread of virulent aphid genotypes wheat resistance aphid virulence and temperature affect russian wheat aphid development reproduction and mortality girma et al 1990 jyoti and michaud 2005 kieckhefer and elliott 1989 merrill et al 2008 michels and behle 1988 randolph et al 2008 webster and starks 1987 data from these studies were used to generate regression equations for the effects of temperature on these rates on susceptible versus resistant plants because the effects of temperature were non linear quadratic equations were used data from the literature on the impacts of temperature on the development and mortality of a atriplicis bernal and gonzalez 1996 and a certus frewin et al 2010 were used to estimate coefficients for non linear regression equations again if rates became negative in the simulations they were set to zero for a atriplicis at 10 c 16 c 21 c and 28 c development time decreased from low to high temperatures and mortality was higher at 10 c than at the other temperatures bernal and gonzalez 1996 for a certus at 15 c 18 c 21 c 25 c 27 c and 30 c development time decreased from 15 c to 27 c and parasitism increased over the same range frewin et al 2010 these results have been used elsewhere in models of the interactions between parasitoids and hosts at different temperatures miksanek and heimpel 2019 2 4 density dependence of parasitism alate formation and aphid reproduction i used the functional response of a certus to variation in a glycines density and the effect of temperature on percent parasitism by a certus frewin et al 2010 to calculate search rate and handling time and their temperature dependence because such data are lacking on these relationships for a atriplicis i used the same response norms for this parasitoid data from the literature were used to generate regression equations for the effects of aphid density on the formation of winged aphids alates by a glycines on soybean martinez and costamagna 2018 and by d noxia on wheat messina 1993 half of the alates were assumed to disperse from the system and half were assumed to return to the plant type on which they developed carrying capacity was estimated from data in papers that reported the maximum numbers of aphids found per tiller in wheat feng and nowierski 1992a 1992b lee et al 2005 legg et al 1992 1994 or per plant in soybean hesler and beckendorf 2021 kaser and heimpel 2018 ragsdale et al 2007 rhainds et al 2010 2 5 temperature regimes to simulate population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids in warm versus cool climates i used data for daily maximum and minimum temperatures from 2012 to 2021 in southern locations stoneville ms for soybean college station tx for wheat and northern locations lancaster mn for soybean fort collins co for wheat fig s3 the temperatures for each location were from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa langley research center larc prediction of worldwide energy resource power project funded through the nasa earth science applied science program and in particular from the power project s hourly 2 3 5 version on 2023 01 08 maximum and minimum temperatures differed between southern and northern locations for wheat f 90 4 df 1 2018 p 0 0001 and f 1168 1 df 1 2018 p 0 0001 respectively and soybean f 167 0 df 1 2018 p 0 0001 and f 640 4 df 1 2018 p 0 0001 for wheat the differences in mean temperatures were of 2 2 c for maxima and 7 2 c for minima for soybean the differences in mean temperatures were of 2 9 c for maxima and 5 6 c for minima i calculated hourly temperatures from these data using the following function 7 t h o u r t max t t min t 2 t max t t min t cos h o u r 12 2 π 24 where tmax t and tmin t are the daily maximum and minimum temperatures using the hourly temperatures the values for each parameter were calculated using response norm regressions and then averaged over the 24 period to get daily values these daily values were used in the eqs 1 6 for population dynamics 2 6 initial populations all simulations were started with 0 1 avirulent nymphal aphids 10 avirulent adult aphids 0 01 virulent nymphal aphids and 1 virulent adult aphid on each plant type susceptible versus resistant as well as 0 01 adult female parasitoid on each plant and aphid type the idea was to approximate the numbers of insects per plant that would occur at the beginning of the growing season with the assumption that virulent aphids would be initially rare i e 10 percent frequency 2 7 simulation conditions population dynamics of avirulent versus virulent aphids in the absence versus presence of parasitoids were simulated separately for each of the ten years of 100 day growing seasons day of year 100 200 in southern locations and day of year 130 230 in northern locations in each crop and each location three conditions for ratios of susceptible versus resistant plants were simulated 50 percent of each type all susceptible plants and all resistant plants susceptible plants alone is the most realistic scenario for soybean because almost no resistant seed is currently planted resistant plants alone is the most realistic for wheat because almost no susceptible seed is currently planted however all three scenarios were simulated for each system to allow comparisons between the two crops and compare strategies of resistance deployment 2 8 sensitivity analysis for search rate and adult parasitoid survival most of the parameters and response norms were based on data from the literature however the search dispersal and mortality rates of adult female parasitoids had the least data to support them also no data were available for response norms of virulent soybean aphids to measure the sensitivity of outputs to changes in the response norms for search and mortality rates i varied the intercepts of the regression equations in models that included parasitoids i took this approach because a previous meta analysis of geographic variation in responses to temperature of various life history and behavioral traits showed that shifts in response norms were most often vertical i e involved a rise or fall of the metric of performance across all tempetatures rather than horizontal i e to higher or lower temperatures along the temperature axis or a narrowing or broadening of the response norm tuzun and stoks 2018 i used regression intercepts for search rate that were 0 5x 1x 2x and 3x the base values and i used regression intercepts for adult parasitoid mortality that 0 9x 1x 2x and 3x an intercept less than 0 9x the base would cause negative mortality to test the effects of varying amounts of dispersal by adult female parasitoids between resistant and susceptible plants i used dispersal fractions of 0 0 1 the base value and 0 2 on wheat nymphs of virulent aphids have higher mortality on susceptible plants than on resistant plants to test this effect on soybean i used the difference in the regression intercepts for nymphal mortality of avirulent versus virulent aphids on susceptible wheat to estimate the regression intercept for mortality of virulent aphids on susceptible soybean which increased the intercept 1 4x and compared the output with that under the assumption that virulent aphids had the same mortality as avirulent aphids on susceptible soybean 2 9 data analysis using generalized linear models glm function in the r stats package r core team 2020 i did analysis of deviance for the effects of model structure plant genotype and presence versus absence of parasitoids location and their interaction on the areas under the curves for the number of virulent aphids virulent aphid days and on percent virulence estimated from percent virulent aphid days of total aphid days for each crop separately the sources of variation in these analyses were the differences among years and locations in the actual temperature regimes observed among the growing season of 2012 2021 the areas under curves were calculated using the auc function in the desctools in the r package signorell et al 2022 the gamma distribution was used for the analysis of effects on the number of virulent aphids and the normal distribution for analysis the effects on percent virulence because these distributions gave highest model probability among normal negative binomial and gamma distributions calculated from the residual deviance divided by residual degrees of freedom compared to a chi square distribution littell et al 1996 marginal means for levels of factors were estimated with the emmeans function in the emmeans r package lenth 2019 supplementary material includes tables s1 and s2 with details of the results of analyses of deviances tables s3 and s4 with means and confidence intervals and figs s2 s13 with additional plots of population dynamics for sensitivity analyses i used generalized linear models to test the effects of changes the response norm intercepts for parasitoid search rate and adult parasitoid mortality and the effects of changes in parasitoid dispersal between resistant and susceptible plants and how this varied with model structure location and their interaction in each crop i also tested the effects of different levels of nymphal mortality of virulent aphids on soybean and how this varied with model structure location and their interaction 3 results 3 1 parasitoids reduced abundance and frequency of virulent aphids model structure plant genotype and presence versus absence of parasitoids and the interaction of model structure with location northern versus southern affected virulent aphid days on wheat although location alone did not model structure f 200 3 df 5 114 p 0 00001 location f 0 003 df 1 113 p 0 96 interaction f 9 2 df 5 108 p 0 00001 see table s1 for details of analysis of deviance parasitoids reduced virulent aphid days by 7 to 13 fold on mixed wheat types fig 2 a table s3a when only resistant wheat was included the model parasitoids had about the same impact as with mixed wheat types reducing virulent aphid days 6 to 12 fold but when only susceptible wheat was included parasitoids had less impact reducing virulent aphid days 4 to 6 fold fig 2a table s3a most of the impact in wheat was from strongly reduced aphid abundance in the second half of the season fig 3 plots of population dynamics for all model structures and locations are given in figs s4 s15 mixed wheat types had somewhat higher virulent aphid days than susceptible wheat alone and lower virulent aphid days than resistant wheat alone whether parasitoids were present or absent which is not surprising given that resistant plants would select for virulent aphids fig 2a model structure location and their interaction affected virulent aphid days on soybean model structure f 739 1 df 5 114 p 0 00001 location f 213 2 df 1 113 p 0 00001 interaction f 23 7 df 5 108 p 0 00001 table s1b however the impact of parasitoids was lower than on wheat parasitoids reduced virulent aphid days by 3 to 6 fold on soybean with mixed soybean types fig 2b table s3b when only resistant soybean was included parasitoids had more impact decreasing virulent aphid days 4 to 8 fold but when only susceptible soybean was included parasitoids had less impact reducing virulent aphid days from 60 percent to 4 fold fig 2b table s3b on soybean aphid abundance was reduced only later in the season fig 4 which explains in part why the impact on virulent aphid days was less than in wheat as with wheat mixed soybean types had somewhat higher virulent aphid days than susceptible soybean alone and lower virulent aphid days than resistant soybean alone without parasitoids however with parasitoids in the north susceptible soybean alone gave higher virulent aphid days than mixed soybean types and resistant soybean alone gave lower virulent aphid days than mixed soybean types although parasitoids reduced the abundance of virulent aphids in both crops in all scenarios of plant type and location fig 2 the effects of parasitoids on percent virulence measured as the percent virulent aphid days among total aphid days differed between crops fig 5 on wheat model structure location and their interaction affected percent virulence model structure f 1186 9 df 5 114 p 0 00001 location f 15 9 df 1 113 p 0 0001 interaction f 11 6 df 5 108 p 0 00001 table s2a parasitoids reduced percent virulence on mixed wheat types by 5 14 percent and on resistant wheat alone by 16 25 percent fig 5a table s4a however on susceptible wheat alone parasitoids had no effect on soybean model structure location and their interaction affected percent virulence model structure f 3808 3 df 5 114 p 0 00001 location f 40 4 df 1 113 p 0 00001 interaction f 33 4 df 5 108 p 0 00001 table s2b parasitoids had little or no effect on percent virulence on mixed soybean types but increased percent virulence by 4 15 percent on susceptible soybean alone and by 4 9 percent resistant soybean alone fig 5b table s4b percent virulence was higher on soybean than on wheat for all scenarios of plant type and presence versus absence of parasitoids in both northern and southern locations compare figs 5a and b 3 2 temperature regime affects the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids as shown above model structure and the interaction of model structure with location affected virulent aphid days on wheat in both the north fort collins co and the south college station tx fig 2a there was little difference in virulent aphid days between north and south without parasitoids but with parasitoids virulent aphid days were 2 fold higher in the north than in the south table s3a also as discussed above model structure location and their interaction affected percent virulence on wheat here the difference between north and south was larger with parasitoids on mixed wheat types and resistant wheat alone fig 5a in the north parasitoids reduced percent virulence by 5 percent on mixed wheat types and 16 percent on resistant wheat and in the south parasitoids reduced percent virulence by 14 percent on mixed wheat types and 25 percent on resistant wheat table s4a on susceptible wheat alone parasitoids had no effect in the north or south as shown above model structure location and their interaction affected all affected virulent aphid days on soybean without parasitoids virulent aphid days were about 2 fold higher on soybean in the south stoneville ms than in the north lancaster mn with all plant type scenarios fig 2b however parasitoids eliminated this difference with mixed soybean types and with resistant soybean parasitoids reduced virulent aphid days 14 percent in the south compared to the north and with susceptible plants parasitoids reduced virulent aphid days 25 percent in the south compared to the north table s3b as shown above model structure location and their interaction affected percent virulence on soybean although parasitoids had no effect on percent virulence in either location on mixed soybean types parasitoids increased percent virulence on susceptible soybean by 15 percent in the north and 4 percent in the south and on resistant soybean by 4 percent in the north and 9 percent in the south fig 5b table s4b 3 3 sensitivity analysis effects of changes in search rate adult parasitoid mortality parasitoid dispersal and nymphal mortality of virulent aphids raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of search rate i e increasing parasitoid search rate reduced virulent aphid days fig s16 and the magnitude of changes were affected by many of the interactions of search rate location and model structure but not the triple interaction on wheat or the interactions of search rate with model structure or location on soybean table s5 raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of search rate reduced percent virulence in wheat but the effects were weaker than for virulent aphid days and had no effect on resistant soybean in either location or susceptible soybean in the northern location fig s17 the magnitude of changes were affected by many of the interactions of search rate and model structure location and model structure but not by the interaction of search rate and location on both crops or the triple interaction of wheat table s6 raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of adult parasitoid mortality i e increasing parasitoid mortality increased virulent aphid days fig s18 and the magnitude of changes were affected by several of the interactions of mortality location and model structure but not the triple interaction for wheat or the interaction between mortality and model structure for soybean table s7 raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of adult parasitoid mortality i e increasing parasitoid mortality increased percent virulence on wheat but had no effect on percent virulence on soybean fig s19 and the magnitude of changes were affected by several of the interactions of mortality location and model structure but not the triple interaction for wheat or the interaction between mortality and model structure for soybean table s8 increasing the fraction of female parasitoids that dispersed between resistant and susceptible plants decreased virulent aphid days although the effect was larger in northern locations fig s20 disperal fraction interacted with location on soybean but not on wheat table s9 raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of nymphal mortality for virulent aphids on susceptible soybean decreased virulent aphid days in the absence of parasitoids but had no effect in the presence of parasitoids with mixed resistant and susceptible plants and a small effect in the presence of parasitoids on susceptible plants alone fig s21 table s10 4 discussion previously no mathematical models and indeed no other types of studies have addressed the combined effects of plant resistance aphid virulence parasitoids and climate on the abundances avirulent versus virulent aphids the results reported here indicate that parasitoids can reduce virulent aphid days a measure of the season long abundance and thus potential impact of virulent aphids on both wheat and soybean in northern and southern locations and on susceptible plus resistant susceptible alone and resistant alone plant genotypes the impacts were about twice as large on wheat than on soybean percent virulence which measures the relative frequency of virulent insect genotypes is another metric of concern because it indicates the likelihood virulent genotypes will increase over time on wheat parasitoids reduced percent virulence in both the north and south on resistant wheat alone and on resistant plus susceptible wheat but not on susceptible wheat alone why on soybean parasitoids did not affect percent virulence on susceptible plus resistant soybean in either the north or south however parasitoids increased virulence on susceptible soybean alone and to a lesser extent on resistant soybean in both the north and south the increase in percent virulence on susceptible soybean alone can be explained by frequency dependent attack on avirulent aphids leading to an increase in percent virulence because avirulent aphids were more frequent than virulent aphids on susceptible soybean in the absence of parasitoids the increase in percent virulence on resistant soybean alone was caused by the combined impacts of plant resistance and parasitism on avirulent aphids which reduced their abundance to essentially zero so the only aphids present were virulent sensitivity of model outputs to changes in parasitoids search rate and adult parasitoid mortality gave predictable although nuanced results increases in search rate decreased virulent aphid days in both crops and the magnitudes of the impacts were affected by the interaction between search rate location and model structure increases in search rate also reduced percent virulence in wheat but the effects were weaker than for virulent aphid days and such increases had no effect on resistant soybean increases in adult parasitoid mortality increased virulent aphid days and the magnitude of the impacts were affected by several of the interactions between mortality location and model structure increases in adult parasitoid mortality increased percent virulence on wheat but had no effect on percent virulence on soybean in wheat the magnitude of changes were affected by several of the interactions between mortality location and model structure increases in the fraction of female parasitoids that dispersed between resistant and susceptible plants decreased virulent aphid days although the effect was larger in northern locations this appears to result from increased parasitoid disperal allow closer tracking aphid abundance and thus having a greater impact on virulent aphids this result suggests that the level of parasitoid dispersal has implications for the spatial pattern of deployment of resistant and susceptible varieties however detailed analysis of this effect awaits measurements of actual parasitoid dispersal the increase in nymphal mortality for virulent aphids on susceptible soybean decreased virulent aphid days in the without parasitoids but had little or no effect with parasitoids at first glance the results reported here concerning northern versus southern locations might appear to differ from those of several other mathematical models of the population dynamics in aphid parasitoid systems that addressed the effects of changes in temperature regimes and in some cases explicitly the impact of climate change on population dynamics bannerman and roitberg 2014 gebauer et al 2015 meisner et al 2014 miksanek and heimpel 2019 however none these previous studies addressed the abundances or frequencies virulent aphids bannerman and roitberg 2014 simulated the effects of extreme fluctuating temperatures on the population dynamics aphidius matricariae hymenoptera braconidae and its host myzus persicae hemiptera aphididae high maximum temperatures frequencies with which they occurred and autocorrelation between occurrences interacted in their effects on population dynamics with frequent autocorrelated high temperatures leading to extinction gebauer et al 2015 simulated the effects of predicted future climates on the population dynamics of diaeretiella rapae hymenoptera braconidae and its host brevicoryne brassicae hemiptera aphididae future warmer climates led to population growth earlier in the spring for both species but especially for d rapae but maximum population sizes of the aphids still increased meisner et al 2014 simulated the effects of low versus high temperatures on the population dynamics of aphidius ervi hymenoptera braconidae and its host acyrthosiphon pisum hemiptera aphididae the results were complex but suggested that increased mean temperatures would decrease the period and increase the amplitude of population cycles and so destabilize aphid parasitoid dynamics among other factors miksanek and heimpel 2019 simulated the effects of different temperatures on the population dynamics of a certus and the soybean aphid and found that higher temperatures reduced suppression of the soybean aphid by a certus a potential problem with the results presented here and with those in other papers discussed above is that the temperatue response norms for variousb traits were measured in the laboratory this may be particularly problematic for mortality rates which may be much higher in the field than in the laboratory furthermore adult mortality rates for parasitoids as a function of temperature were not available for these parasitoids although mortality rates were available at one temperature thus we assumed that the shapes of response norms where similar for adult aphids and parasitoids while intercepts could be inferred from the limited data on adult parasitoid longevity an issue unique to our simulations is that the data on the effects of avirulent versus virulent aphids and susceptible versus resistant plants on the parasitoids is quite patchy furthermore for virulent aphids in the soybean system data are lacking for development mortality and reproduction so we assumed that virulent aphids would have the same response norms as avirulent aphids on susceptible plants however we also tested the effects of increased nymphal mortality for virulent aphids on susceptible soybean as has been observed for the wheat system 5 conclusions parasitoids reduced the abundance of virulent aphids capable of overcoming plant resistance on both wheat and soybean the reductions were greater on wheat than on soybean on wheat parasitoids reduced the percent of virulent aphids on resistant wheat alone the current situation and on suscepetible plus resistant plants on soybean parasitoids did not affect the percent of virulent aphids on suscepetible plus resistant plants and increased the percent of virulent aphids on susceptible alone and resistant soybean alone the increase in percent virulence on susceptible soybean was caused by frequency dependent parasitism of avirulent aphids and the increase percent virulence on resistant soybean was cause by the drastic decline in avirulent aphids in the face of the combination of resistant plants and parasitoids if one is willing to accept that comparisons of population dynamics in southern versus northern locations indicate the likely affects of climate change in the northern locations the simulation results presented here suggest that climate change would lead to a decrease in the abundance of virulent aphids in northern locations however this conclusion must be tempered by caveats about the patchy data on responses to temperature in life history traits of the aphids and particularly in the parasitoids that attack them data availability as described in the methods published data were used for

24210,invasions by insects that become pests are an increasing problem for agriculture introductions of parasitoids from the regions of pest origin and breeding plants resistant to invasive pests can reduce the abundances and impacts of pests while providing safe sustainable alternatives to insecticides however impacts of parasitoids and plant resistance are likely to interact and the abiotic environment and in particular climate change is likely to affect these interactions here i report results from simulations with mathematical models of population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids on resistant versus susceptible plants parameterized with published results designed to test the following hypotheses 1 parasitoids can reduce abundances and frequencies of virulent aphids able to overcome plant resistance 2 temperature regime affects the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids and 3 the outcomes of these interactions vary with crop two systems were modeled the soybean aphid aphis glycines on soybean and the russian wheat aphid diuraphis noxia on wheat the parasitoids in the models are in the genus aphelinus species of which have a long association with biological control of invasive pests in the simulations with these models parasitoids reduced the abundances and on wheat the percent of virulent aphids the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids were greater in southern locations than in northern locations and the impacts on virulent aphids were greater on wheat than on soybean indeed parasitoids actually increased the frequencies of virulent aphids on soybean when only susceptible plants were present while reducing the abundance of all aphids if one accepts that comparisons of population dynamics in southern versus northern locations indicate the likely affects of climate change in the northern locations these results suggest that climate change would lead to decreased abundance and frequency of virulent aphids in northern locations keywords

literature cited in paper 1 introduction invasions of insects that become pests are an increasing problem for agriculture paini et al 2016 two management strategies introductions of parasitoids from the regions of pest origin and breeding plants resistant to invasive pests have proven effective at reducing pest abundance and impact while providing safe sustainable alternatives to insecticides cock et al 2016 smith 2005 however parasitoids and plant resistance are likely to interact in their impact on pests for reviews see bottrell et al 1998 peterson et al 2016 thomas and waage 1996 parasitoids may cause density or frequency dependent mortality of virulent herbivores that have overcome plant resistance such mortality could slow the spread and reduce the prevalence of virulence gould et al 1991 and thus support plant resistance in pest management smith 1989 furthermore resistant plants may increase the impact of parasitoids by slowing host development and thus increasing exposure time or by reducing immune responses of hosts to parasitoids on the other hand resistant plants may compromise biological control by producing toxins that affect parasitoids or by killing pests before parasitoids complete development whether plant resistance and parasitoids interact positively or negatively depends on the details of behavior ecology and genetics gould et al 1991 the abiotic environment and in particular climate change is likely to affect these interactions predictions about climate change include increases in mean temperatures and in the frequencies of extreme weather ippc 2014 divergences in the responses of hosts and parasitoids to these changes may disrupt overlaps in their temporal or spatial distributions chidawanyika et al 2019 damien and tougeron 2019 and thus cause pest outbreaks hance et al 2007 research has shown that interactions between plant resistance and aphid virulence vary with temperature chirumamilla et al 2014 randolph et al 2008 richardson 2012 as do interactions between aphids and parasitoids bernal and gonzalez 1996 frewin et al 2010 wang et al 2016 virulent biotypes of aphids have overcome resistance of some plant genotypes making previously resistant plant types susceptible to attack and resistant versus susceptible plants can affect the impact of natural enemies on herbivores particularly on avirulent versus avirulent aphids these ideas have been used to model likely outcomes of host parasitoids interactions bottrell et al 1998 gould et al 1991 thomas and waage 1996 however neither experiments nor mathematical models have been used to analyze how climate change could affect whether parasitoids would reduce the spread of virulent aphids here i report results from simulations with mathematical models of population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids on resistant versus susceptible plants parameterized with published experimental results designed to test the following hypotheses 1 parasitoids can reduce abundances and frequencies of virulent aphids able to overcome plant resistance 2 temperature regime affects the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids and 3 the outcomes of these interactions vary with crop the impact of parasitism on the interactions between plant resistance and aphid virulence and how this impact was affected by climate were modeled for two systems the soybean aphid aphis glycines matsumura on soybean and the russian wheat aphid diuraphis noxia kurdjumov hemiptera aphididae on wheat the parasitoids in the models are in the genus aphelinus hymenoptera aphelinidae species of which have a long association with biological control of invasive pests arce gomez and rumiatto 1989 cate et al 1973 clausen 1978 hopper et al 1998 raney et al 1971 sell and kuo sell 1989 for the soybean aphid i modeled the effects of parasitism by aphelinus certus jasnosh that arrived on its own in the u s soon after the soybean aphid invaded heimpel et al 2010 hopper et al 2017b 2019 for the russian wheat aphid i modeled the effects parasitism by aphelinus atriplicis kurdjumov which was introduced and established in the u s in the 1990 s to control this aphid hopper et al 1998 2017a to make predictions about the impacts of climate change i modeled dynamics under temperature regimes at the northern versus southern extremes of the geographical distributions in the u s of the aphids in the current climate avila et al 2019 venette and ragsdale 2004 the idea was to use differences in geography as a surrogate for changes in climate that are likely to emerge over time the expectation being that temperature regimes will move northward as the climate warms tuzun and stoks 2018 the overall goal was to provide information that growers can use to manage these pests with plant resistance and biological control as alternatives to insecticides to my knowledge this is the first modeling effort and indeed the first research to address the effects of crop plant resistance aphid virulence parasitoids and climate on the abundances avirulent versus virulent aphids 2 materials and methods 2 1 study systems the soybean aphid invaded the u s from asia in 2000 and has since spread to most regions where soybean is grown ragsdale et al 2004 in asia the soybean aphid seldom reaches damaging levels in part because of natural enemies liu et al 2004 miao et al 2007 in the u s the soybean aphid has become the most important pest of soybean decreasing yields and incurring large control costs kim et al 2008 ragsdale et al 2011 song and swinton 2009 current control relies on insecticides which are a major disruption in the 80 million acres where soybean is grown because insecticides were rarely used prior to the soybean aphid invasion furthermore pyrethroid resistance has developed in u s soybean aphid populations hanson et al 2017 although soybean resistance to soybean aphid has been identified aphid biotypes that can overcome this resistance already occur in the u s for review see hill et al 2017 aphelinus certus was accidentally introduced into north america and since has spread throughout much of region where the soybean aphid is a pest and this parasitoid is now attacking the aphid at high levels heimpel et al 2010 in asia a certus is frequently found parasitizing the soybean aphid and shows geographically variable host specificity although it always does well on soybean aphid hopper et al 2019 there is some evidence for population control of soybean aphid by a certus in the u s kaser and heimpel 2018 although other evidence suggests limited population level impacts miksanek and heimpel 2020 the russian wheat aphid invaded the u s from eurasia in 1986 stoetzel 1987 and has since spread to 17 western states becoming a major pest of wheat and barley morrison and peairs 1998 like the soybean aphid the russian wheat aphid is seldom a pest in eurasia where natural enemies can limit its abundance basky and hopper 2000 chen and hopper 1997 hopper et al 1995 aphelinus species are among the most important natural enemies of the russian wheat aphid in eurasia hopper et al 1998 2017a aphelinus atriplicis was collected in the caucasus region of southern russia and introduced into the u s in 1991 hopper et al 1998 and has since become one of the major natural enemies of the russian wheat aphid noma et al 2005 research has been published on the impacts of temperature on the development survival and reproduction of the soybean aphid chen et al 2017 hirano et al 1996 hough et al 2017 kikuchi et al 2018 mccornack et al 2004 richardson et al 2011 and the russian wheat aphid girma et al 1990 ma and bechinski 2008 randolph et al 2008 tazerouni et al 2013 these data along with information on geographical distributions have been used to model population dynamics and potential spread of the soybean aphid costamagna et al 2007 onstad et al 2005 whitney et al 2016 and the russian wheat aphid avila et al 2019 hughes and maywald 1990 legg and brewer 1995 nowierski et al 1995 ulrichs and hopper 2008 the genus aphelinus hymenoptera aphelinidae comprises at least 94 species noyes 2019 all of which are internal parasitoids of aphids and many of which are important in biological control hopper et al 1998 2017a 2017b aphelinus adults are small 1 mm long and weak fliers searching for hosts and mates primarily while walking fauvergue et al 1995 at 20 c aphelinus develop from oviposited eggs to third instars in 7 days when they kill and mummify their hosts christiansen weniger 1994 and adults emerge in another 10 days bernal and gonzalez 1996 frewin et al 2010 besides parasitizing aphids adult females of aphelinus paralyze and kill aphids and feed on aphid hemolymph to get nutrients amino and fatty acids for egg production and survival females 1 2 days old carry 15 mature eggs in their oviducts hopper and diers 2014 but produce many more eggs throughout their lives female of aphelinus species can parasitize 100 aphids during a median lifetime of two weeks in the laboratory 2 2 model structure for each aphid and parasitoid species mathematical models were developed for the tritrophic interactions between plant resistance aphid virulence and parasitism and model parameters were estimated from results in the literature difference equation stage structured models were used along the lines of those developed for the impact parasitoids on aphids bannerman and roitberg 2014 gebauer et al 2015 meisner et al 2014 miksanek and heimpel 2019 and other parasitoid host interactions godfray and waage 1991 hopper 1989 hopper and stark 1987 hopper and whitford 1989 i used a simple model structure with an eye towards being able to estimate model parameters from existing data or future experiments fig 1 for each system i used two aphid stages nymphs and adults and two parasitoid stages juveniles i e parasitized aphids and adult females reproductive rates of aphids depended on plant resistance aphid virulence and temperature reproductive rates of parasitoids depended on functional responses numbers parasitized versus aphid density that in turn depended on temperature development rates of aphids and parasitoids depended on plant resistance aphid virulence and temperature mortality of aphids depended on plant resistance aphid virulence parasitism and temperature juvenile parasitoids in aphids were assumed to suffer the same mortality as their aphid hosts the population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids were modeled as follows 1 n t 1 i n t i r t i h t i d n t i n t i m n t i n t i n a t i 2 h t 1 i h t i d n t i n t i m h t i h t i f a t i h t i h a t i 3 p t 1 i p t i n a t i h a t i d p t i p t i m n t i p t i 4 f t 1 i f t i s t i p t i m f t f t i d i s p t i f t i where n t i and h t i are the numbers at time t in days of nymphal and adult aphids respectively p t i and f t i are the numbers at time t of parasitoid juveniles parasitized aphids and female parasitoid adults respectively and na t i and ha t i are the numbers at time t of nymphs and aphids respectively attacked by female parasitoids all of these groups and the parameters that affect them varied with values of i from 1 to 4 which indicate combinations of virulence and resistance 1 avirulent aphids on susceptible plants 2 avirulent aphids on resistant plants 3 virulent aphids on susceptible plants and 4 virulent aphids on resistant plants aphid reproductive rate was assumed to be limited by plant carrying capacity and so reproductive rate was multiplied by the ratio of carrying capacity to the numbers of aphids on a given plant type the numbers of parasitized aphid nymphs na and adults ha were modeled as a type ii functional reponse holling 1959 as follows 5 n a t i f t i n t i n t i h t i a n t i 1 a h n t i 6 h a t i f t i h t i n t i h t i a h t i 1 a h h t i search rate a and handling time h were estimated from non linear regressions of the numbers parasitized versus host density in r r core team 2020 for models that included both resistant and susceptible plants a fraction of parasitoids disp were assumed to move between resistant and susceptible plants each day the dispersing parasitoids were distributed among the plant types in proportion to the relative abundance of aphids on that type thus if the aphids were equally abundant on both plant types the dispersing parasitoids would be distributed equally on each type but if all the aphids where on one plant type all the dispersing parasitoids would be allocated to that type the population models and the regressions of temperature response norms of parameters were coded in r r core team 2020 document s1 in supplementary material parameter definitions are given in table 1 and regression coefficients for the relationships between parameter values and temperature for wheat are in table 2 and those for soybean in table 3 plots of the response norms are shown in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2 2 3 parameter estimation effects of temperature plant resistance and aphid virulence soybean resistance aphid virulence and temperature have been shown to affect soybean aphid development reproduction and mortality chirumamilla et al 2014 hough et al 2017 mccornack et al 2004 richardson 2012 richardson et al 2011 data from these studies were used to generate regression equations for the effects of temperature on these rates for susceptible versus resistant plants because the effects of temperature were non linear quadratic equations were used although if rates became negative in the simulations they were set to zero in research on avirulent sba1 versus virulent aphids sba2 and 3 at 14 21 and 28 c chirumamilla et al 2014 found no interaction between temperature and biotype or between temperature biotype and resistance in their effects on aphid population growth however resistance and biotype interacted such that the virulent biotype was as abundant on plants with the rag1 resistance gene as susceptible plants but the avirulent biotype was much less abundant on plants with the rag1 resistance gene than on susceptible plants thus in the simulations here virulent aphids were assumed to have similar rates of development reproduction and mortality on susceptible versus resistant plants and that these rates matched those of avirulent aphids on susceptible plants however the effect of this assumption was tested in sensitivity analyses using an alternative assumption that there was a cost to virulence through increase mortality of virulent nymphs on susceptible plants although numbers of aphids parasitized by binodoxys communis hymenoptera braconidae were lower on resistant versus susceptible soybean chacon et al 2012 ghising et al 2012 parasitism by a atriplicis misidentified as aphelinus albipodus did not differ between susceptible versus resistant wheat brewer et al 1998 farid et al 1998 some studies have shown reduced survival longer development time and smaller size for parasitoids aphidius colemani binodoxys communis on resistant plants ballman et al 2012 ghising et al 2012 ode and crompton 2013 in previous research soybean aphids on plants with rag1 or rag2 resistance did not differ in oviposition by a glycinis or a certus hopper and diers 2014 rag1 had no effect on the number of aphids mummified by a certus but rag2 reduced the number of aphids mummied four fold and both rag1 and rag2 reduced the number of aphids mummified by a glycinis two fold in preliminary experiments i have measured the effects of plant resistance and aphid biotype on parasitism of the soybean aphid by a certus unpublished data for soybean i used the ld14 8003 which is resistant in three gene regions rag1 rag2 and rag3 and ld14 8007 which is susceptible in the same three regions for soybean aphid i used the avirulent biotype sba1 which produces lower numbers of progeny on plants with resistance in any of these regions and the virulent biotype sba4 whose reproduction is not affected by resistance in these regions the results of these experiments are preliminary and larger sample sizes are needed but median parasitism was higher for the virulent biotype on both resistant and susceptible plants for a glycinis and a certus the difference was greatest for virulent versus avirulent aphids on resistant plants with a certus this is the sort of density dependent parasitism that may slow the spread of virulent aphid genotypes wheat resistance aphid virulence and temperature affect russian wheat aphid development reproduction and mortality girma et al 1990 jyoti and michaud 2005 kieckhefer and elliott 1989 merrill et al 2008 michels and behle 1988 randolph et al 2008 webster and starks 1987 data from these studies were used to generate regression equations for the effects of temperature on these rates on susceptible versus resistant plants because the effects of temperature were non linear quadratic equations were used data from the literature on the impacts of temperature on the development and mortality of a atriplicis bernal and gonzalez 1996 and a certus frewin et al 2010 were used to estimate coefficients for non linear regression equations again if rates became negative in the simulations they were set to zero for a atriplicis at 10 c 16 c 21 c and 28 c development time decreased from low to high temperatures and mortality was higher at 10 c than at the other temperatures bernal and gonzalez 1996 for a certus at 15 c 18 c 21 c 25 c 27 c and 30 c development time decreased from 15 c to 27 c and parasitism increased over the same range frewin et al 2010 these results have been used elsewhere in models of the interactions between parasitoids and hosts at different temperatures miksanek and heimpel 2019 2 4 density dependence of parasitism alate formation and aphid reproduction i used the functional response of a certus to variation in a glycines density and the effect of temperature on percent parasitism by a certus frewin et al 2010 to calculate search rate and handling time and their temperature dependence because such data are lacking on these relationships for a atriplicis i used the same response norms for this parasitoid data from the literature were used to generate regression equations for the effects of aphid density on the formation of winged aphids alates by a glycines on soybean martinez and costamagna 2018 and by d noxia on wheat messina 1993 half of the alates were assumed to disperse from the system and half were assumed to return to the plant type on which they developed carrying capacity was estimated from data in papers that reported the maximum numbers of aphids found per tiller in wheat feng and nowierski 1992a 1992b lee et al 2005 legg et al 1992 1994 or per plant in soybean hesler and beckendorf 2021 kaser and heimpel 2018 ragsdale et al 2007 rhainds et al 2010 2 5 temperature regimes to simulate population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids in warm versus cool climates i used data for daily maximum and minimum temperatures from 2012 to 2021 in southern locations stoneville ms for soybean college station tx for wheat and northern locations lancaster mn for soybean fort collins co for wheat fig s3 the temperatures for each location were from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa langley research center larc prediction of worldwide energy resource power project funded through the nasa earth science applied science program and in particular from the power project s hourly 2 3 5 version on 2023 01 08 maximum and minimum temperatures differed between southern and northern locations for wheat f 90 4 df 1 2018 p 0 0001 and f 1168 1 df 1 2018 p 0 0001 respectively and soybean f 167 0 df 1 2018 p 0 0001 and f 640 4 df 1 2018 p 0 0001 for wheat the differences in mean temperatures were of 2 2 c for maxima and 7 2 c for minima for soybean the differences in mean temperatures were of 2 9 c for maxima and 5 6 c for minima i calculated hourly temperatures from these data using the following function 7 t h o u r t max t t min t 2 t max t t min t cos h o u r 12 2 π 24 where tmax t and tmin t are the daily maximum and minimum temperatures using the hourly temperatures the values for each parameter were calculated using response norm regressions and then averaged over the 24 period to get daily values these daily values were used in the eqs 1 6 for population dynamics 2 6 initial populations all simulations were started with 0 1 avirulent nymphal aphids 10 avirulent adult aphids 0 01 virulent nymphal aphids and 1 virulent adult aphid on each plant type susceptible versus resistant as well as 0 01 adult female parasitoid on each plant and aphid type the idea was to approximate the numbers of insects per plant that would occur at the beginning of the growing season with the assumption that virulent aphids would be initially rare i e 10 percent frequency 2 7 simulation conditions population dynamics of avirulent versus virulent aphids in the absence versus presence of parasitoids were simulated separately for each of the ten years of 100 day growing seasons day of year 100 200 in southern locations and day of year 130 230 in northern locations in each crop and each location three conditions for ratios of susceptible versus resistant plants were simulated 50 percent of each type all susceptible plants and all resistant plants susceptible plants alone is the most realistic scenario for soybean because almost no resistant seed is currently planted resistant plants alone is the most realistic for wheat because almost no susceptible seed is currently planted however all three scenarios were simulated for each system to allow comparisons between the two crops and compare strategies of resistance deployment 2 8 sensitivity analysis for search rate and adult parasitoid survival most of the parameters and response norms were based on data from the literature however the search dispersal and mortality rates of adult female parasitoids had the least data to support them also no data were available for response norms of virulent soybean aphids to measure the sensitivity of outputs to changes in the response norms for search and mortality rates i varied the intercepts of the regression equations in models that included parasitoids i took this approach because a previous meta analysis of geographic variation in responses to temperature of various life history and behavioral traits showed that shifts in response norms were most often vertical i e involved a rise or fall of the metric of performance across all tempetatures rather than horizontal i e to higher or lower temperatures along the temperature axis or a narrowing or broadening of the response norm tuzun and stoks 2018 i used regression intercepts for search rate that were 0 5x 1x 2x and 3x the base values and i used regression intercepts for adult parasitoid mortality that 0 9x 1x 2x and 3x an intercept less than 0 9x the base would cause negative mortality to test the effects of varying amounts of dispersal by adult female parasitoids between resistant and susceptible plants i used dispersal fractions of 0 0 1 the base value and 0 2 on wheat nymphs of virulent aphids have higher mortality on susceptible plants than on resistant plants to test this effect on soybean i used the difference in the regression intercepts for nymphal mortality of avirulent versus virulent aphids on susceptible wheat to estimate the regression intercept for mortality of virulent aphids on susceptible soybean which increased the intercept 1 4x and compared the output with that under the assumption that virulent aphids had the same mortality as avirulent aphids on susceptible soybean 2 9 data analysis using generalized linear models glm function in the r stats package r core team 2020 i did analysis of deviance for the effects of model structure plant genotype and presence versus absence of parasitoids location and their interaction on the areas under the curves for the number of virulent aphids virulent aphid days and on percent virulence estimated from percent virulent aphid days of total aphid days for each crop separately the sources of variation in these analyses were the differences among years and locations in the actual temperature regimes observed among the growing season of 2012 2021 the areas under curves were calculated using the auc function in the desctools in the r package signorell et al 2022 the gamma distribution was used for the analysis of effects on the number of virulent aphids and the normal distribution for analysis the effects on percent virulence because these distributions gave highest model probability among normal negative binomial and gamma distributions calculated from the residual deviance divided by residual degrees of freedom compared to a chi square distribution littell et al 1996 marginal means for levels of factors were estimated with the emmeans function in the emmeans r package lenth 2019 supplementary material includes tables s1 and s2 with details of the results of analyses of deviances tables s3 and s4 with means and confidence intervals and figs s2 s13 with additional plots of population dynamics for sensitivity analyses i used generalized linear models to test the effects of changes the response norm intercepts for parasitoid search rate and adult parasitoid mortality and the effects of changes in parasitoid dispersal between resistant and susceptible plants and how this varied with model structure location and their interaction in each crop i also tested the effects of different levels of nymphal mortality of virulent aphids on soybean and how this varied with model structure location and their interaction 3 results 3 1 parasitoids reduced abundance and frequency of virulent aphids model structure plant genotype and presence versus absence of parasitoids and the interaction of model structure with location northern versus southern affected virulent aphid days on wheat although location alone did not model structure f 200 3 df 5 114 p 0 00001 location f 0 003 df 1 113 p 0 96 interaction f 9 2 df 5 108 p 0 00001 see table s1 for details of analysis of deviance parasitoids reduced virulent aphid days by 7 to 13 fold on mixed wheat types fig 2 a table s3a when only resistant wheat was included the model parasitoids had about the same impact as with mixed wheat types reducing virulent aphid days 6 to 12 fold but when only susceptible wheat was included parasitoids had less impact reducing virulent aphid days 4 to 6 fold fig 2a table s3a most of the impact in wheat was from strongly reduced aphid abundance in the second half of the season fig 3 plots of population dynamics for all model structures and locations are given in figs s4 s15 mixed wheat types had somewhat higher virulent aphid days than susceptible wheat alone and lower virulent aphid days than resistant wheat alone whether parasitoids were present or absent which is not surprising given that resistant plants would select for virulent aphids fig 2a model structure location and their interaction affected virulent aphid days on soybean model structure f 739 1 df 5 114 p 0 00001 location f 213 2 df 1 113 p 0 00001 interaction f 23 7 df 5 108 p 0 00001 table s1b however the impact of parasitoids was lower than on wheat parasitoids reduced virulent aphid days by 3 to 6 fold on soybean with mixed soybean types fig 2b table s3b when only resistant soybean was included parasitoids had more impact decreasing virulent aphid days 4 to 8 fold but when only susceptible soybean was included parasitoids had less impact reducing virulent aphid days from 60 percent to 4 fold fig 2b table s3b on soybean aphid abundance was reduced only later in the season fig 4 which explains in part why the impact on virulent aphid days was less than in wheat as with wheat mixed soybean types had somewhat higher virulent aphid days than susceptible soybean alone and lower virulent aphid days than resistant soybean alone without parasitoids however with parasitoids in the north susceptible soybean alone gave higher virulent aphid days than mixed soybean types and resistant soybean alone gave lower virulent aphid days than mixed soybean types although parasitoids reduced the abundance of virulent aphids in both crops in all scenarios of plant type and location fig 2 the effects of parasitoids on percent virulence measured as the percent virulent aphid days among total aphid days differed between crops fig 5 on wheat model structure location and their interaction affected

effect on percent virulence on mixed soybean types but increased percent virulence by 4 15 percent on susceptible soybean alone and by 4 9 percent resistant soybean alone fig 5b table s4b percent virulence was higher on soybean than on wheat for all scenarios of plant type and presence versus absence of parasitoids in both northern and southern locations compare figs 5a and b 3 2 temperature regime affects the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids as shown above model structure and the interaction of model structure with location affected virulent aphid days on wheat in both the north fort collins co and the south college station tx fig 2a there was little difference in virulent aphid days between north and south without parasitoids but with parasitoids virulent aphid days were 2 fold higher in the north than in the south table s3a also as discussed above model structure location and their interaction affected percent virulence on wheat here the difference between north and south was larger with parasitoids on mixed wheat types and resistant wheat alone fig 5a in the north parasitoids reduced percent virulence by 5 percent on mixed wheat types and 16 percent on resistant wheat and in the south parasitoids reduced percent virulence by 14 percent on mixed wheat types and 25 percent on resistant wheat table s4a on susceptible wheat alone parasitoids had no effect in the north or south as shown above model structure location and their interaction affected all affected virulent aphid days on soybean without parasitoids virulent aphid days were about 2 fold higher on soybean in the south stoneville ms than in the north lancaster mn with all plant type scenarios fig 2b however parasitoids eliminated this difference with mixed soybean types and with resistant soybean parasitoids reduced virulent aphid days 14 percent in the south compared to the north and with susceptible plants parasitoids reduced virulent aphid days 25 percent in the south compared to the north table s3b as shown above model structure location and their interaction affected percent virulence on soybean although parasitoids had no effect on percent virulence in either location on mixed soybean types parasitoids increased percent virulence on susceptible soybean by 15 percent in the north and 4 percent in the south and on resistant soybean by 4 percent in the north and 9 percent in the south fig 5b table s4b 3 3 sensitivity analysis effects of changes in search rate adult parasitoid mortality parasitoid dispersal and nymphal mortality of virulent aphids raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of search rate i e increasing parasitoid search rate reduced virulent aphid days fig s16 and the magnitude of changes were affected by many of the interactions of search rate location and model structure but not the triple interaction on wheat or the interactions of search rate with model structure or location on soybean table s5 raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of search rate reduced percent virulence in wheat but the effects were weaker than for virulent aphid days and had no effect on resistant soybean in either location or susceptible soybean in the northern location fig s17 the magnitude of changes were affected by many of the interactions of search rate and model structure location and model structure but not by the interaction of search rate and location on both crops or the triple interaction of wheat table s6 raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of adult parasitoid mortality i e increasing parasitoid mortality increased virulent aphid days fig s18 and the magnitude of changes were affected by several of the interactions of mortality location and model structure but not the triple interaction for wheat or the interaction between mortality and model structure for soybean table s7 raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of adult parasitoid mortality i e increasing parasitoid mortality increased percent virulence on wheat but had no effect on percent virulence on soybean fig s19 and the magnitude of changes were affected by several of the interactions of mortality location and model structure but not the triple interaction for wheat or the interaction between mortality and model structure for soybean table s8 increasing the fraction of female parasitoids that dispersed between resistant and susceptible plants decreased virulent aphid days although the effect was larger in northern locations fig s20 disperal fraction interacted with location on soybean but not on wheat table s9 raising the intercept for the temperature response norm of nymphal mortality for virulent aphids on susceptible soybean decreased virulent aphid days in the absence of parasitoids but had no effect in the presence of parasitoids with mixed resistant and susceptible plants and a small effect in the presence of parasitoids on susceptible plants alone fig s21 table s10 4 discussion previously no mathematical models and indeed no other types of studies have addressed the combined effects of plant resistance aphid virulence parasitoids and climate on the abundances avirulent versus virulent aphids the results reported here indicate that parasitoids can reduce virulent aphid days a measure of the season long abundance and thus potential impact of virulent aphids on both wheat and soybean in northern and southern locations and on susceptible plus resistant susceptible alone and resistant alone plant genotypes the impacts were about twice as large on wheat than on soybean percent virulence which measures the relative frequency of virulent insect genotypes is another metric of concern because it indicates the likelihood virulent genotypes will increase over time on wheat parasitoids reduced percent virulence in both the north and south on resistant wheat alone and on resistant plus susceptible wheat but not on susceptible wheat alone why on soybean parasitoids did not affect percent virulence on susceptible plus resistant soybean in either the north or south however parasitoids increased virulence on susceptible soybean alone and to a lesser extent on resistant soybean in both the north and south the increase in percent virulence on susceptible soybean alone can be explained by frequency dependent attack on avirulent aphids leading to an increase in percent virulence because avirulent aphids were more frequent than virulent aphids on susceptible soybean in the absence of parasitoids the increase in percent virulence on resistant soybean alone was caused by the combined impacts of plant resistance and parasitism on avirulent aphids which reduced their abundance to essentially zero so the only aphids present were virulent sensitivity of model outputs to changes in parasitoids search rate and adult parasitoid mortality gave predictable although nuanced results increases in search rate decreased virulent aphid days in both crops and the magnitudes of the impacts were affected by the interaction between search rate location and model structure increases in search rate also reduced percent virulence in wheat but the effects were weaker than for virulent aphid days and such increases had no effect on resistant soybean increases in adult parasitoid mortality increased virulent aphid days and the magnitude of the impacts were affected by several of the interactions between mortality location and model structure increases in adult parasitoid mortality increased percent virulence on wheat but had no effect on percent virulence on soybean in wheat the magnitude of changes were affected by several of the interactions between mortality location and model structure increases in the fraction of female parasitoids that dispersed between resistant and susceptible plants decreased virulent aphid days although the effect was larger in northern locations this appears to result from increased parasitoid disperal allow closer tracking aphid abundance and thus having a greater impact on virulent aphids this result suggests that the level of parasitoid dispersal has implications for the spatial pattern of deployment of resistant and susceptible varieties however detailed analysis of this effect awaits measurements of actual parasitoid dispersal the increase in nymphal mortality for virulent aphids on susceptible soybean decreased virulent aphid days in the without parasitoids but had little or no effect with parasitoids at first glance the results reported here concerning northern versus southern locations might appear to differ from those of several other mathematical models of the population dynamics in aphid parasitoid systems that addressed the effects of changes in temperature regimes and in some cases explicitly the impact of climate change on population dynamics bannerman and roitberg 2014 gebauer et al 2015 meisner et al 2014 miksanek and heimpel 2019 however none these previous studies addressed the abundances or frequencies virulent aphids bannerman and roitberg 2014 simulated the effects of extreme fluctuating temperatures on the population dynamics aphidius matricariae hymenoptera braconidae and its host myzus persicae hemiptera aphididae high maximum temperatures frequencies with which they occurred and autocorrelation between occurrences interacted in their effects on population dynamics with frequent autocorrelated high temperatures leading to extinction gebauer et al 2015 simulated the effects of predicted future climates on the population dynamics of diaeretiella rapae hymenoptera braconidae and its host brevicoryne brassicae hemiptera aphididae future warmer climates led to population growth earlier in the spring for both species but especially for d rapae but maximum population sizes of the aphids still increased meisner et al 2014 simulated the effects of low versus high temperatures on the population dynamics of aphidius ervi hymenoptera braconidae and its host acyrthosiphon pisum hemiptera aphididae the results were complex but suggested that increased mean temperatures would decrease the period and increase the amplitude of population cycles and so destabilize aphid parasitoid dynamics among other factors miksanek and heimpel 2019 simulated the effects of different temperatures on the population dynamics of a certus and the soybean aphid and found that higher temperatures reduced suppression of the soybean aphid by a certus a potential problem with the results presented here and with those in other papers discussed above is that the temperatue response norms for variousb traits were measured in the laboratory this may be particularly problematic for mortality rates which may be much higher in the field than in the laboratory furthermore adult mortality rates for parasitoids as a function of temperature were not available for these parasitoids although mortality rates were available at one temperature thus we assumed that the shapes of response norms where similar for adult aphids and parasitoids while intercepts could be inferred from the limited data on adult parasitoid longevity an issue unique to our simulations is that the data on the effects of avirulent versus virulent aphids and susceptible versus resistant plants on the parasitoids is quite patchy furthermore for virulent aphids in the soybean system data are lacking for development mortality and reproduction so we assumed that virulent aphids would have the same response norms as avirulent aphids on susceptible plants however we also tested the effects of increased nymphal mortality for virulent aphids on susceptible soybean as has been observed for the wheat system 5 conclusions parasitoids reduced the abundance of virulent aphids capable of overcoming plant resistance on both wheat and soybean the reductions were greater on wheat than on soybean on wheat parasitoids reduced the percent of virulent aphids on resistant wheat alone the current situation and on suscepetible plus resistant plants on soybean parasitoids did not affect the percent of virulent aphids on suscepetible plus resistant plants and increased the percent of virulent aphids on susceptible alone and resistant soybean alone the increase in percent virulence on susceptible soybean was caused by frequency dependent parasitism of avirulent aphids and the increase percent virulence on resistant soybean was cause by the drastic decline in avirulent aphids in the face of the combination of resistant plants and parasitoids if one is willing to accept that comparisons of population dynamics in southern versus northern locations indicate the likely affects of climate change in the northern locations the simulation results presented here suggest that climate change would lead to a decrease in the abundance of virulent aphids in northern locations however this conclusion must be tempered by caveats about the patchy data on responses to temperature in life history traits of the aphids and particularly in the parasitoids that attack them data availability as described in the methods published data were used for

24211,modeling biotope distributions is of paramount importance to monitor species habitats and guide conservation and restoration actions to decrease population extinction rates however modeling biotopes as independent landscape units as is current practice has some limitations vegetation communities that define biotopes evolve through different stages and associations until they reach an equilibrium to consider these temporal dynamics we developed a modeling approach based on potential natural vegetation pnv corresponding to ecological contexts supporting vegetation succession the assumption made is that modeling pnv better distinguishes biotope ecological niches improving prediction accuracy results of the final prediction map were excellent with an overall accuracy of 0 95 and a kappa coefficient of 0 91 the proposed method was also compared with a classic biotope model and our approach showed 29 mean improvement in accuracy our results produced a good distinction between the different ecological niches of potential natural vegetation however some areas of confusion were identified but these are mainly explained by imprecision and incompleteness of the reference biotope dataset and long term human management using potential natural vegetation is therefore recommended for further studies on biotope mapping keywords potential natural vegetation biotope species distribution model vegetation dynamics vegetation communities data availability data will be made available on request abbreviations pnv potential natural vegetation bdm biotope distribution modeling 1 introduction the conservation and restoration of functional species habitat networks became a priority to tackle landscape fragmentation one of the key factor of biodiversity loss hilty et al 2020 ipbes 2019 resasco 2019 this strategy implies the use of multiple information sources involving the recording and mapping of species of interest vegetation ecological conditions land use pressures management dispersal barriers and many more one key source of information is vegetation mapping using the biotope concept a biotope is a landscape unit characterized by specific environmental conditions and supporting a characteristic community of species a species habitat is considered as the set of biotopes it needs to complete its lifecycle forman 1995 löfvenhaft et al 2002 biotope level can therefore be considered as the finest unit of landscape management for conservation purpose biotopes are commonly described by the vegetation species assemblages depending on more or less precise ecological conditions davies et al 2004 generally these ecological conditions are defined by topography hydrography climate soil type and human management justifying that biotope units are significant landscape features however as biotope surveys require skilled teams that sometimes have to cover large territories lillesand et al 2008 biotope mapping is therefore limited by time consuming surveys which restricts their capacity to be up to date in a land use change context to circumvent these technical limitations biotope modeling using available environmental predictors and remote sensing data is increasingly being developed horvath et al 2019 maggini et al 2006 this approach derived from species distribution modeling sdm produces relatively accurate maps of the current or the potential distribution of biotopes when taking into account land cover or not álvarez martínez et al 2018 horvath et al 2019 current and potential biotope distributions are also strategic information to design ecological networks biotope restoration can then target areas to increase species habitat patches and limit fragmentation impacts to compensate habitat loss due to human activities jones et al 2021 the interest and quality of biotope distribution modeling bdm is however limited because several biotopes can occupy similar ecological conditions soil climate and topography during the vegetation successions indeed plant communities characterizing biotopes evolve naturally from pioneer open biotopes to mature forest biotopes reaching one or several stages of equilibrium called climax niering 1987 different types of successional patterns are possible with dynamics of natural or artificial disturbances that for example restart the process of succession regressive dynamics lock in at certain stages etc blasi et al 2004 rees et al 2001 woodward 2009 bdm accuracy is thus disturbed by the competition between different biotopes belonging to the same succession in similar ecological conditions and the difficulty of having descriptive variables to discriminate the different stages some authors consider this issue by focusing only on climax stage biotopes horvath et al 2019 maggini et al 2006 the presence of some stages biotopes of a vegetation succession is also impacted by human management that restricts them to less productive areas such as the steepest slopes or the most superficial soils hall 1988 the observed relationship between some biotope distribution and environmental conditions therefore can only be one part of the potential biotope environmental niche one pragmatic solution to consider temporal dynamics of ecosystems is to use the concept of potential natural vegetation pnv pnv concept was defined by tuxen 1956 as the vegetation that would develop in a particular ecological zone or environment assuming the conditions of flora and fauna to be natural if the action of man on the vegetation mantle stopped and in the absence of substantial alteration in present climatic conditions gallizia vuerich et al 2001 by convention pnv therefore refer to climax vegetation but it designs the ecological conditions necessary for the development of the main stages of the associated succession loidi and fernández gonzález 2012 prach et al 2016 the concept of pnv allows to define landscape units that share similar ecological contexts regardless of the stage of natural vegetation succession leguédois et al 2011 stumpel and kalkhoven 1978 this concept was used in the past to classify landscapes to guide nature oriented sylviculture conservation and landscape planning de keersmaeker et al 2013 such pnv maps can also be used as one of multiple approaches to determine the conservation status or naturalness of areas by measuring the difference between pnv and current land cover hemsing and bryn 2012 or to identify gaps and completion of networks of protected areas such as natura 2000 bohn and gollub 2006 pnv mapping can be seen as an integrative approach that better considers vegetation dynamics which is important for the design and connectivity of ecological networks and their management it has the advantage of better delineating the maximum potential distribution of biotopes depending on the ecological context and therefore ensures network coherence it also helps to guide the management of conservation and restoration actions based on natural disturbance to create a more heterogeneous landscape however the expected link between pnv typology and ecological conditions is well debated among experts chiarucci et al 2010 pioneer or intermediate biotopes are sometimes shared by different vegetation succession series the dynamic drivers influencing a biotope to develop to a specific vegetation succession may be subtle variations in ecological factors and vegetation composition that are undetected in the field the result of biological processes competition and predation favoring certain species or the impact of direct management or indirect pollution eutrophication etc effects of present and past human activities however a lot of example of vegetation communities evolving to the expected climax exist thanks to a better understanding of these successions loidi and fernández gonzález 2012 prach et al 2016 the most important prerequisites to map pnv are therefore loidi and fernández gonzález 2012 1 a pnv typology that is sufficiently validated with quite exclusive biotopes belonging to each pnv 2 a validated mapping of the different biotopes belonging to each pnv 3 a precise mapping of ecological factors which are supposed to play an essential and proximal role in biotope distribution pnv mapping also benefited from the development of distribution modeling approaches and multiple examples of pnv modeling exist reger et al 2014 somodi et al 2017 recent studies addressed different topics such as the best modeling approach hemsing and bryn 2012 the representation of multiple overlapping modeled pnv somodi et al 2017 the definition of pnv de keersmaeker et al 2013 or the modeling of numerous pnv at larger liu et al 2009 and smaller scales longcore et al 2018 when pnv and related vegetation communities are well identified they are mainly based on national classification systems and models are calibrated on stable climax forest or open areas stages reference data hemsing and bryn 2012 building pnv based on species assemblage using floristic occurrence data is far more complex and raise many methodological questions de keersmaeker et al 2013 the presence of characteristic species is highly dependent of natural sites condition and some pnv may not have any highly characteristic species de keersmaeker et al 2013 the integration of multiple pnv predictions into a single map allows to better apprehend such useful results but current aggregation method are complex somodi et al 2017 on the other hand single biotope modeling i e peat bogs calcareous grasslands moors etc is still being applied horvath et al 2019 in the literature pnv concept seems to be a closed study field as many biotopes modeling study cases do not even mention pnv concept álvarez martínez et al 2018 horvath et al 2019 however and as mentioned earlier modeling pnv present many advantages to produce accurate and useful prediction map of biotopes in this paper we propose a methodological framework which aims to be as most replicable as possible using biotope classification systems and mapping used in all european countries in contrast to last pnv modeling applications using last stable forest stages we suggest modeling pnv using multiples biotopes from the same vegetation succession to better cover the ecological niches of pnv in disturbed landscapes our methodological framework also proposes a simpler aggregation technique to deliver a unique map of all pnv considering also potential overlaps we will also compare pnv modeling approach to individual biotope modeling and assess performance of both approaches finally we also suggest an independent qualitative assessment of modeled pnv distributions using floristic occurrence data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area wallonia is an administrative region covering southern belgium 17 000 km2 it is characterized by a temperate climate with precipitation distributed throughout the year however the precipitation can double within the territory from 800 to 1600 mm year and its rate increases with altitude the summit of the region is a high peaty plateau that culminates at 694 m above sea level the walloon region can be split into six principal parallel biogeographic zones that are well defined by a large gradient from recent to oldest geological substrates going from nw to se this explains a wide diversity of very different ecological contexts ranging from boreo alpine peatlands to mediterranean limestone lawns less than 30 km away dufrêne and legendre 1991 2 2 methodological framework the proposed approach was carried out in four steps 1 biotopes developing in the same ecological context were identified and referred to one specific pnv by using historic and recent expert knowledge to maximize the difference between pnv ecological contexts 2 pnv distributions were individually modeled using environmental predictors including topographic information soil conditions and climatic parameters 3 to obtain a unique typology for the territory pnv prediction maps were used as predictors to produce a classification to test the potential presence of the different pnv 4 finally overlaps between individually modeled pnv distributions were identified these mixed pnv areas allowed us to identify where the proposed classification is more uncertain the general workflow of our method is summarized in fig 1 2 3 pnv construction the biotope classification and denominations used in this study are based on the eunis european nature information system classification for biotope types davies et al 2004 eunis is a hierarchical classification describing every biotope and habitat present in europe from natural to artificial and covering terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems the eunis classification was adapted to wallonia by the public research agency in order to match regional variations dufrêne and delescaille 2005 each biotope is characterized by a unique code the pnv modeled in this study were identified to cover almost all ecological contexts of the region using phytosociological literature delescaille et al 2021 complemented by expert opinion the region has historically hosted several famous authors working on phytosociology and vegetation successions who precisely described the different vegetation stages their dynamics and links with ecological contexts making expert opinion highly robust duvigneaud 1949 herbauts and tanghe 1987 noirfalise 1984 venseveren 1969 common and scarce biotopes were selected if there was sufficient data to model them and if they belong to only one vegetation succession some open biotopes such as sub montane vaccinium and calluna heaths can evolve toward two different climax stages medio european acidophilous fagus forests and medio european thermophile acidophilous quercus forests and were therefore discarded biotopes corresponding to intensive agricultural practices or exotic tree plantations were also eliminated as they are not linked to a particular ecological condition all biotopes and pnv assignations are compiled in table 1 for further details appendix a presents all biotopes belonging to a pnv even if they are present in multiple pnv 2 4 environmental dataset belgium has the particularity to be covered by a large diversity of environmental datasets at high resolution for instance the country is covered by a soil dataset with detailed information on soil structure composition and humidity at a precise scale 1 10 000 bah et al 2007 more modern tools like digital elevation models based on lidar light detection and ranging are also available at high resolution 1m these precise environmental informations make it possible to better capture the relationship between environmental predictor and vegetation assemblages than it could be with generic and larger scale dataset such as soilgrids poggio et al 2021 the environmental variables used as predictors to model pnv distributions were split into three categories climatic variables soil dependent variables and topographic variables bioclimatic variables were extracted from high resolution 1 km² climate data derived from the downscaling of eurocordex regional climate model rcm datasets representing the historical climate between 1971 and 2005 and covering all europe de troch et al 2020 eurocordex rcm is considered as more spatially coherent at fine scale than widely used models such as worldclim or climate eu chakraborty et al 2021 this dataset proposes a subset of best climatic predictor for species distribution modeling and integrate original interesting climatic variable such as annual mean potential evapotranspiration soil related variables were principally extracted from the digital soil map of wallonia bah et al 2007 carte numérique des sols de wallonie série 2015 different soil types calcareous podzol organic sandy alluvial and source were stored as binary variables natural soil drainage drainage hydric level hydric lvl and trophic level trophic lvl were extracted as ordinal variables natural drainage was subdivided into 5 ordinal classes directly derived from the soil map dry and very dry soils moderately dry and wet soils wet soils with temporary water table very wet soils with temporary water table very wet and peaty soils two variables were derived from a dataset created to guide sylvicultural practices petit et al 2017 hydric level hydric lvl is a variable evaluating the humidity level of a soil based on the combination of natural drainage soil texture and topographic position trophic level trophic lvl is a variable quantifying the amount of nutrients available to the plants based on a dichotomous key using soil characteristics these cartographic data are available online in open access forestimator 2021 soil texture sand and silt proportions present in the soil were not available in soil maps but from another data source by performing a convolution between texture information from the walloon digital soil map and the kriging of more accurate and latest field observation points d or dimitri 2021 these are continuous variables with the proportion of sand and silt measured at a 50 m resolution finally topographic continuous variables included elevation elevation slope percentage slope prc topographic position index calculated in a 200 m radius normalized from 0 to 100 tpi and the potential incident light energy in w m² for the first day of spring sunspring these predictors are derived from 1 m lidar acquisition resampled at 10 m and produced for the study purpose relief de la wallonie modèle numérique de surface mns 2013 2014 hillshade 2015 the radiative subsector radiative ss and the potential water intake water int are categorical variables constructed with dichotomous keys based on relative position slope and exposure to guide sylvicultural practices petit et al 2017 they are also available online in open access forestimator 2021 predictors used in this study have different resolutions ranging from 1 km for climate data to 10 m for topographic ones we chose to resample all predictors to 10 m resolution to match the finest resolution as it is recommended by the literature as the better solution to perform accurate models moudrý et al 2023 autocorrelation was tested to conserve independent variables for modeling elevation and all climatic variables except the annual variation of precipitation annualvariationprecipitation showed a pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 7 or lower than 0 7 and were considered to be strongly correlated ratner 2009 but bioclimatic variables are considered of high biological significance influencing plant and species distribution bede fazekas and somodi 2020 they were summarized by using the two main principal component axes resulting from a principal component analysis pca climatic pca 1 and climatic pca 2 to limit correlation but keep the maximum amount of information 88 and 10 of explained variance this use of multivariate analysis to create a composite predictor has already been used and give convincing results in species and ecosystem distribution modeling ejrnæs 2000 santos et al 2020 simensen et al 2020 normality of each variable was tested and values were transformed if necessary slope percentage and annual variation of precipitation were transformed with a logarithmic function in total 19 environmental predictors were kept for modeling table 2 areas not described in soil maps i e urban areas watercourses and parts of military domains were not considered in the model they appear as no data on maps presented in this paper 2 5 vegetation data as part of the implementation of the european union council directive 92 43 eec on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora loidi 1999 detailed mapping of biotopes has been carried out by the different member states field biotope inventories realized in the walloon region between 2005 and 2020 as part of the implementation of this directive were used as a reference dataset for pnv biotope limits were identified as polygons mapped at 1 10 000 and each of them is characterized by a eunis code this field mapping is performed using dichotomous keys based on vegetation structure and species assemblage to identify eunis biotopes limits of biotopes are drawn using national geographic maps to differentiate open areas from forest and digital soil maps are used to refine limits identified on the field precise biotope mapping is not published and was provided directly by the public service in charge spw dgarne demna as natural vegetation rarely follows tangible limits the change from one biotope to another is not always a sharp edge but rather a continuous local gradient kuchler 1973 transitions and mosaics between biotopes can also be complicated and difficult to map field survey agents address this problem by identifying and mapping complexes of several biotopes which are intertwined dufrêne and delescaille 2007 hearn et al 2011 those complexes may negatively affect a model s accuracy by decreasing strong differences between ecological conditions of biotopes and were therefore discarded horvath et al 2019 we therefore only selected polygons containing a unique eunis code that could be linked to a pnv following table 1 covering 65 599 ha to limit the imprecision of biotope and ecological variable mapping we shrank biotope polygons greater than 1 ha corresponding to more widespread pnv with a 20 m inner buffer fammenian quercus and carpinus forests neutrophile fagus forests acidophilous fagus forests and calcareous fagus and quercus forests are the most widespread biotopes in wallonia delescaille et al 2021 the area covered by theses pnv potentially affected by errors and polygon limit inaccuracies is not negligible compared to scarcer biotope areas which are more typical of extreme ecological conditions the rarest biotopes have been subject to more precise mapping because nearly all are biotopes of community interest sensu the european habitat directive defining aims of natura 2000 network loidi 1999 they are also easily delineable on the ground this step of shrinking the most widespread biotopes improved the quality of scarcer biotope models modified biotope polygons were then used to link each pnv to every cell of the environmental predictor raster stack that falls into them to reduce the spatial autocorrelation effect we applied a random spatial sampling to select a maximum of 50 pixels per km² for each pnv that reduced the dataset to approximately 200 000 rows 5 of the complete dataset this sampling helped to initially balance the distribution of pnv occurrences by limiting those dominating the landscape the evolution of pnv areas following the different sampling steps is available in appendix b 2 6 individual pnv modeling a first modeling step was performed for each pnv with presence absence data the presence of a pnv was attributed to each pixel where an eunis habitat associated to the pnv have been mapped on the field all other eunis habitat associated to other pnv were considered as absence horvath et al 2019 maggini et al 2006 we could have used presence only models such as maxent álvarez martínez et al 2018 but the way pnv were defined with unambiguous biotopes related to specific ecological context made it possible to perform robust presence absence models models were calibrated through a random forest algorithm using the randomforest r package breiman 2001 random forest algorithm is recognized for its accuracy and its computational efficiency it can easily handle small sample size and high dimension models which make it perfect to model scarce pnv biau and scornet 2016 random forest is also known to be less sensitive to overfitting when calibrated with large sample size which is interesting in our case for common pnv belgiu and drăguţ 2016 finally random forest performs for both regression and classification that make it versatile enough for our methodological framework achieving individual modeling and global classification without complexifying the method biau and scornet 2016 the model was calibrated using 70 of the selected presence absence dataset on this calibration dataset a smote synthetic minority oversampling technique algorithm was applied to balance presence absence frequency without losing too much information chawla et al 2002 the smote algorithm decreases dominant class generally absences and artificially increases the minority class generally presences before modeling a variable selection was performed on the calibration dataset using vsurf variable selection using random forest genuer et al 2015 all variables selected at the prediction step of the vsurf algorithm were kept for modeling random forest model tuning focused on the mtry argument i e the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split as it is considered to be the most influential parameter probst et al 2019 multiple tests were performed to choose the best mtry value giving low error and less computational time these tests resulted in the use of the square root of the number of variables kept after selection which corresponds to what is found in the literature probst et al 2019 model results were first validated using the 30 remaining test set the area under the curve auc was used to evaluate model robustness using this test set a second validation was performed on the 95 dataset discarded by spatial sampling to measure the accuracy of predictive maps different accuracy metrics were calculated in order to compare predictive maps and assess their adequacy the overall accuracy oa the producer accuracy pa and the user accuracy ua oa is the proportion of well classified pixels presence and absence compared to the total number of pixels used for validation pa is the proportion of correctly classified reference pixels compared to the total number of reference pixel that represent the point of view of the cartographer evaluating the model prediction ua is the proportion of well classified presence pixels compared to the total number of predicted presences this evaluates the model performance to predict pnv presence from the point of view of the map user for these threshold dependent metrics oa pa and ua the threshold maximizing the f score was used to transform model probability to presence absence the f score is the harmonic mean of the receiver operating characteristic roc curve the five most important environmental predictors for the random forest model and their importance for the model were also identified based on the gini index aldrich 2020 2 7 dominant pnv classification a second modeling step was performed using results of each pnv prediction as an input for a new random forest classification to produce a unique classification map of pnv results of specific pnv probabilities cannot be compared to identify what the dominant pnv is for a pixel specific pnv probabilities are average results from multiple specific classification trees with specific distributions of values however they can be used as variables for a new classification that will identify the most likely pnv for each pixel based on pnv probabilities the smote algorithm can only be performed on a two class dataset to balance the different pnv frequencies before modeling we decided to weight pnv classes as this is the recommended approach to balance a dataset for random forest classification of more than two classes while keeping all the information chen and breiman 2004 we weighted pnv classes according to their prevalence by applying eq 1 to each class 1 w e i g h t 1 f r e q c l a s s 2 where f r e q c l a s s is the proportion of the class i e the pnv this helped to give more weight to less represented pnv for instance the weight of the rare xerophile fammenian quercus and carpinus forests is 0 99 while the weight of the common acidophilous fagus forests is 0 53 the same oa pa and ua metrics used for the specific pnv modeling were calculated we also calculated the cohen s kappa coefficient that measures the global accuracy of a classification comparing the proportion of well classified pixels to the total number of pixels compared to a random classifier to interpret cohen s kappa coefficient results we used the classification proposed by landis and koch 1977 that consider a kappa value below 0 2 as slight between 0 21 and 0 40 as fair between 0 41 and 0 60 as moderate between 0 61 and 0 80 as substantially good and above 0 81 as an almost perfect classifier 2 8 identification of areas with mixed pnv as previously explained biotope distributions do not follow tangible and exclusive limits in the field gradients and complexes of multiple biotopes are common where biotope environmental niches overlap dominant pnv classification attributes to each pixel the dominant pnv even in less ecologically specific areas where multiple pnv could overlap in order to get closer to reality and identify less certain classified areas we chose to identify areas where several pnv are in competition to do so predictive distributions of each individual pnv were transformed to binary presence absence maps using the threshold maximizing f score these binary maps were therefore all added together and areas where the presence of multiple pnv overlapped were considered as mixed areas the area of each type of pnv present in mixed areas has been measured and compared to the total area of the concerned pnv if the mixed area represented more than 10 of the total surface of one pnv in question it was kept those below 10 were discarded this allowed most pnv associated with important confusion after classification to be kept discarding small and irrelevant confusion issues all retained mixed areas were added to the pnv classification map as an overlay then we recalculated accuracy metrics for each pnv with validation data by considering the potential presence of the pnv in single and mixed areas mixed areas were therefore considered as a presence for the validation of each pnv concerned 2 9 complementary analysis 2 9 1 individual biotope modeling vs pnv to identify gains or losses of using the pnv approach compared to individual biotope modeling that consider biotopes independent as it is commonly applied horvath et al 2019 maggini et al 2006 we also performed modeling of biotopes composing the pnv for calcareous fagus and quercus forests we chose this pnv as it includes several biotopes of different succession stages that are exclusive to the pnv it is also the only one with sufficient data about open and semi open biotopes to enable accurate and robust individual models biotopes belonging to calcareous fagus and quercus forest succession were modeled considering the targeted biotope as presences and all other biotopes of the dataset i e also other biotopes belonging to the same pnv as absences as is done in individual biotope modeling approaches horvath et al 2019 all independent models were used to predict presence absence maps using the threshold maximizing f score to make individual biotope models and the pnv model comparable we added together all biotopes predicted ranges which was compared to the pnv predicted presence range producer accuracy was calculated for each individual biotope i e the proportion of reference pixels related to each biotope belonging to the pnv or the cumulative biotope distributions furthermore each total area of the pnv predicted presence and the cumulative individual biotope predicted presence were calculated to evaluate the specificity of the model a presence prediction that is too large can increase producer accuracy but the model specificity may be low 2 9 2 quality assessment with floristic data indicator plant species observations were also used to complete the quality assessment of pnv predictions using an independent dataset to the one used for model calibration a validated plant dataset compiled for the walloon flora atlas delescaille and delaitte 2011 was filtered to keep only observations of indigenous plants between 2000 and 2020 and location with precision below 100 m pnv information was then assigned to each observation of a plant species a chi² test was performed to measure the dependence between the presence of a plant taxa and each specific pnv discarding mixed pnv the dependence is based on residual chi² t calculated with eq 2 2 t i j o i j e i j 2 e i j where o i j is the number of observations of a taxon i in a pnv j and e i j is calculated based on eq 3 3 e i j o i o j n where o i is the total number of observations for a taxon o j is the total number of observations in a pnv and n is the total number of observations in all pnv chi² test was preferred to similar metric such as indval dufrêne legendre 1997 indeed using indval to compare species occurrence to pnv prediction should results to low values of indicative level as it depends on the proportion of species occurrence on pnv occurrences pnv occurrences is far wider than species occurences as it is a potential prediction and could not be compared to species occurrence that are linked to actual distribution of biotopes 3 results 3 1 dominant pnv classification pnv were firstly modeled individually using the random forest algorithm accuracy metrics results and an example of resulting map are available in appendix c random forest prediction results were then used as independent predictors to perform a classification to identify the dominant pnv for each pixel results of accuracy metrics table 3 show that global accuracy metrics for the classification are almost perfect with 0 95 and 0 91 for oa and cohen s kappa coefficient respectively if we go into further detail we can see that the classification increases producer accuracy for almost all pnv the pa increase is particularly important for 5 pnv out of 13 with an increase higher than 10 the results for ua are more heterogeneous with some pnv gaining in ua and others decreasing two pnv particularly lost accuracy according to ua riparian and gallery woodland and alnus swamp woods to better understand these accuracy losses we performed a confusion matrix that highlights an important confusion between the predicted value for some pnv and reference pixels of acidophilous fagus forests table 4 this is particularly the case in decreasing order of confusion importance for thermophile acidophilous quercus forests acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils alnus swamp woods riparian and gallery woodland quercus and betula forests with molinia and wet and shady ravine forests all these pnv are scarce except for quercus and betula forests with molinia and riparian and gallery woodland we can also see a notable confusion between wet and shady ravine forests and calcareous fagus and quercus forests fig 2 shows the results of classification as a unique map of pnv potential presence results of pnv individual modeling and classification can be viewed online lifewatch fwb ucl geomatics 2022 3 2 identification of areas with mixed potential natural vegetation the identification of potential zones with competition between pnv resulted to ten mixed pnv complexes where the sum of pnv proportions is higher than 10 it appears that pnv concerned with mixed areas representing a large proportion of their presence range are generally those with a lot of overlay as shown in the confusion matrix this is particularly the case for scarcer pnv such as thermophile acidophilous quercus forests acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils and xerophile fammenian quercus and carpinus forests there is an important overlap between neutrophile fagus forests and acidophilous fagus forests involving 30 of neutrophile fagus forests this overlap is not present in the classification as there is not a notable confusion between the two pnv in the confusion matrix accuracy metrics were recalculated considering the potential presence of pnv in mixed areas global results were logically better with a slight decrease of pa in some cases and an appreciable increase of ua for almost all pnv oa slightly increased by 0 004 while kappa increased by 0 019 the list of mixed pnv an example of maps with both pnv and mixed pnv such as trends in accuracy metrics with and without mixed areas are available in appendix d 3 3 complementary analysis 3 3 1 individual biotope modeling vs pnv results of the modeling of the calcareous fagus and quercus forests pnv were compared to the remodeling of each of the biotopes that characterize the vegetation succession of this pnv results are presented in table 5 we can see that pa values were low for individual biotope predictions except for sub atlantic calciphile quercus and carpinus betulus forests the pa values increased when biotope predictions were grouped but the pnv approach performs better for all biotopes except for sub atlantic calciphile quercus carpinus betulus forests where the difference is only 0 4 in other words more biotope reference pixels were encompassed in the pnv range than in the addition of individual biotope predicted presences this represents a mean pa increase of 29 compared to individual biotope predictions and 8 compared to when they are grouped in addition areas of grouped biotope predictions and pnv are similar with 30 250 ha for the pnv and 25 250 ha for the addition of individual biotopes model the large pa for the pnv approach is therefore not due to an excessively large potential distribution 3 3 2 quality assessment with floristic data an additional validation of the pnv models assessed to what extent most dependent species of each pnv based on chi² are known to be indicators of the different related biotopes chi² analyses were performed on plant occurrence data using a pnv classification map to identify most dependent species without considering aquatic species and very rare species appendix e summarized in table 6 most dependent species resulting from chi² analyses are generally indicative or related to biotopes concerned by the modeled pnv species characteristic of both open and forest stages of the pnv are present in the five most dependent species for open habitats species this is true for helianthemum nummularium that is indicative of open stages of calcareous fagus and quercus forests or erica tetralix typical of open stages of quercus and betula forests with molinia for forest species asplenium scolopendrium that is typical of forest stages of wet and shady ravine forests or luzula luzuloides that is present in forest stages of acidophilous fagus forests two pnv had poorer results neutrophile quercus and fraxinus forests on wet soils and acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils some species of these two pnv highlighted by the analysis are not related to the expected environmental conditions 4 discussion 4 1 pnv modeling performance the modeling of individual and dominant pnv showed very convincing results the results of accuracy metrics were good to excellent with extremely high oa and kappa values these results can be explained by the contrasted definition of pnv related to the main ecological context of the study area the diversity of specific ecological conditions covered by the different pnv would favor the prediction of true absences increasing oa other studies modeling biotope distributions have also found better accuracy metric values for the rarest biotopes horvath et al 2019 however these studies only used the auc which is also influenced by true presence and absences as do many studies dealing with single biotope models maggini et al 2006 or pnv modeling hemsing and bryn 2012 however using true absence rate may lead to a false assumption that model results are good and especially concerning scarce biotope pnv indeed for scarce biotope pnv depending on specific ecological context class imbalance between presence and absence data will favor true absence rate pa and ua metrics based principally on true presence showed that results are more nuanced and that attention must be paid with some predicted pnv to model pnv we assumed a deterministic evolution of vegetation succession toward a climax stage which is not agreed upon by all the scientific community chiarucci et al 2010 we therefore paid attention to pnv definition and identifying biotopes belonging to each pnv our results showed a good distinction between the different pnv which proves they were well ecologically defined and that our hypothesis about a deterministic evolution of vegetation succession could be validated furthermore these results underline the benefits and sturdiness of a prior definition of pnv compared to more complex methods where pnv are constructed based on vegetation occurrence datasets de keersmaeker et al 2013 however the existence of mixed areas shows some important overlaps between independent pnv predictions nevertheless modeling pnv has many advantages presented in this paper that brings new light to this old concept classification results to identify dominant pnv had an important global pa increase at the expense of ua which shows that the modeled distribution of pnv had been widened after classification this is especially the case for riparian and gallery woodlands and alnus swamp woods a detailed analysis of the confusion matrix performed on classification results revealed a significant confusion between acidophilous fagus forests and scarcer pnv acidophilous fagus forests is the largest of all pnv representing 64 of reference data and its high prevalence in the validation dataset could also explain why prediction errors are more widely detected in widespread biotopes even if areas of confusion between acidophilous fagus forests and other pnv are small and rare compared to acidophilous fagus forests total area the impact on accuracy metrics may still be significant for the rarest pnv for which less validation data is available this confusion can be explained by different factors both predictor maps such as soil maps and biotope data used for calibration are derived from human interpretation which means that the representation and simplification on a cartographic medium contributes to confusion between pnv secondly fagus forests are the natural dominant vegetation on the walloon territory and can sometimes extend at the border of their range this effect is accentuated by fagus sylvativca competitiveness toward other species homogenization of stands by silvicultural management and high game pressure on less common tree species thirdly biotopes present in scarce pnv depend to their specific ecological conditions that have a spatial pattern defined by topography and hydrography generating many edges therefore the extraction of rasterized environmental predictors of 10 m wide may have created border effects where predictor values of specific ecological conditions may be attributed to the scarce pnv or to the surrounding common pnv this issue has been considered to define the reference data set and its impact limited by removing a 20 m inside buffer from common pnv polygons fourthly more common biotope maps are susceptible to mask scarcer ones as the mapping of common biotopes may be coarser they can include smaller areas with ecological conditions suitable to other pnv a detailed analysis of the acidophilous fagus forests reference data showed that a bigger proportion of riparian and gallery woodlands reference polygons are on wet alluvial soils 43 than that of acidophilous fagus forests 1 but the latter has a greater absolute area of wet alluvial soil 83 398 ha than riparian and gallery woodlands 47 972 ha this issue was anticipated by balancing calibration datasets firstly with spatial sampling and secondly by weighting pnv before classification by giving more importance to scarce pnv we also gave more importance to biotope polygons for which we can have better confidence as more attention was given to them during their mapping 4 2 individual biotope versus pnv modeling the analysis of the independent biotope models of calcareous fagus and quercus forests showed that pnv approach better covers the existing biotope distributions compared to single biotope modeling furthermore pnv modeling using only climax stage vegetation as reference would have used medio european limestone fagus forests delescaille et al 2021 however we can see that using this vegetation alone to model the pnv leads to missing 20 more cells of this biotope than our approach for this example using several biotopes of the succession stage to calibrate the pnv better encompass ecological niche and leads to better predictive results the better results of our approach can be explained by the fact that open biotopes are maintained by human management in our case only a part of them have resumed their succession and another part had their natural succession blocked or brought back to the starting point by human activities our hypothesis is that human activity restricts the distribution of open biotopes to more extreme local ecological contexts that could be only a limited part of the actual ecological niche of the biotope by modeling calcareous fagus and quercus forest pnv we therefore better consider the ecological niche of sub atlantic semi dry calcareous grassland as evidenced by our results 4 3 quality assessment with floristic data quality control of the potential distribution of pnv using floristic data demonstrates that the most dependent pnv species are those that are found in corresponding biotope floristic assemblages delescaille et al 2021 most important issues revealed by this analysis concern neutrophile quercus and fraxinus forests on wet soils and acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils however this can be explained by too low accuracy of available observations poorer sampling inside the biotopes concerned and inherent pnv scarcity especially acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils that impact chi² analysis 4 4 strength and limitations of the approach our approach helped to tackle different issues related to biotope mapping in our case biotopes that are part of other vegetation series were therefore considered as true absences which improved the model s capacity to distinguish them the use of independent models for each pnv to produce a classification as well as the distinction of the mixed zones allowed potential pnv distributions to be refined important pa values for classification and the small change in ua showed that this model was very powerful avoiding omitting the presence of different pnv while keeping a good detection of true presences other approaches have allowed a map to be built with the most dominant biotope from multiple predictions álvarez martínez et al 2018 but the probabilities between two concurrent biotopes were compared and the dominant biotope was assigned to the pixel if the difference of probabilities was higher than a subjective threshold in our approach any subjectivity was avoided through the classification based on individual pnv predictions other methods of biotope modeling may also be followed initiated by margules and stein 1989 vegetation communities could also be considered based on the combined potential distribution of species belonging to the community this approach could be adapted to aim modeling vegetation communities as we did it has the advantage that it could now be performed on vegetation observation from naturalist platforms these data are numerous regularly completed and a large majority are validated however species observations suffer from many problems related to the sampling quality and nature of biological data the data collected rarely follow a standardized methodology they are often spatially biased in favor of the most accessible or attractive areas of a territory such as protected areas biotope mapping is in principle more standardized and systematic and one can trust the absence of a biotope where another has been mapped which is not the case for the presence of a species species location is also not exempt of errors of different types while biotopes delineation corresponds to a combination of regularly observed species and a particular combination of ecological factors but one major problem is the nature of the distribution of species data that cannot in principle share the same ecological niche that characterizes a biotope rare species that are specific of environmental conditions are very difficult to model because their absence can be explained by local ecological factors not measurable at the size of the selected grid 10 10m biotic factors particular adaptation strategies factors associated with the dispersal filter human activities while most frequent species are less indicative and are therefore also generally observed in other combinations of ecological conditions the identification of mixed pnv areas revealed the difficult distinction and blurred delimitation between different pnv where ecological conditions are very close these mixed areas are mainly distributed in the areas most disturbed by human activities and have fewer biotopes of reference for model calibration these transitional areas between different biotopes reflect those typically encountered in the field other methods to tackle overlapping of multiple pnv predictions are complex and do not provide convenient maps but give a more complete information with different comparable probabilities for all overlapping pnv somodi et al 2017 our approach is simpler and we discard some complexes but all information is available in a single convenient map moreover marginal complexes of pnv that were discarded are mainly unrealistic in term of ecological condition that should not overlap 4 5 potential use of pnv map for nature protection and conservation pnv modeling can identify possible priority areas for biotope restoration the new european biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the new european regulation on nature restoration defined very ambitious objectives of surface to protect and conservation status to improve as they concern the implementation of the natura 2000 network and many biotopes of european interest see table 1 pnv modeling make it possible to assess the extent of restoration possibilities and to identify the highest priority areas for increasing existing surfaces or for improving connectivity between them within a pnv the distinction between forest and open biotopes can then be identified using available land cover data which is becoming increasingly accurate and easily available through remote sensing approaches bourdouxhe et al 2020 radoux et al 2019 the use of land use and land cover data in the pnv allows for targeted field sampling of the most potentially interesting areas to complete the mapping of the core areas of biodiversity the pnv concept also allows for the development of much more dynamic approaches to nature conservation to account for natural successions of vegetation rather than trying to fix the different stages in specific locations it is also an opportunity to verify the extent to which all stages are present in the landscape 5 conclusion this study developed a modeling approach that offers new possibilities for large scale biotope modeling with higher predictive accuracy the different datasets and methods used to evaluate the analyze strategy highlight its robustness however pnv modeling is not without its limitations care must be taken with initial definitions and significant phytosociological knowledge is recommended to ensure consistency with field methodology as with many modeling approaches care must also be taken in the selection of baseline data and environmental predictors to ensure that the ecological niches being modeled are distinguishable funding this work was supported by the fédération wallonie bruxelles within the lifewatch wb project credit authorship

24211,modeling biotope distributions is of paramount importance to monitor species habitats and guide conservation and restoration actions to decrease population extinction rates however modeling biotopes as independent landscape units as is current practice has some limitations vegetation communities that define biotopes evolve through different stages and associations until they reach an equilibrium to consider these temporal dynamics we developed a modeling approach based on potential natural vegetation pnv corresponding to ecological contexts supporting vegetation succession the assumption made is that modeling pnv better distinguishes biotope ecological niches improving prediction accuracy results of the final prediction map were excellent with an overall accuracy of 0 95 and a kappa coefficient of 0 91 the proposed method was also compared with a classic biotope model and our approach showed 29 mean improvement in accuracy our results produced a good distinction between the different ecological niches of potential natural vegetation however some areas of confusion were identified but these are mainly explained by imprecision and incompleteness of the reference biotope dataset and long term human management using potential natural vegetation is therefore recommended for further studies on biotope mapping keywords potential natural vegetation biotope species distribution model vegetation dynamics vegetation communities data availability data will be made available on request abbreviations pnv potential natural vegetation bdm biotope distribution modeling 1 introduction the conservation and restoration of functional species habitat networks became a priority to tackle landscape fragmentation one of the key factor of biodiversity loss hilty et al 2020 ipbes 2019 resasco 2019 this strategy implies the use of multiple information sources involving the recording and mapping of species of interest vegetation ecological conditions land use pressures management dispersal barriers and many more one key source of information is vegetation mapping using the biotope concept a biotope is a landscape unit characterized by specific environmental conditions and supporting a characteristic community of species a species habitat is considered as the set of biotopes it needs to complete its lifecycle forman 1995 löfvenhaft et al 2002 biotope level can therefore be considered as the finest unit of landscape management for conservation purpose biotopes are commonly described by the vegetation species assemblages depending on more or less precise ecological conditions davies et al 2004 generally these ecological conditions are defined by topography hydrography climate soil type and human management justifying that biotope units are significant landscape features however as biotope surveys require skilled teams that sometimes have to cover large territories lillesand et al 2008 biotope mapping is therefore limited by time consuming surveys which restricts their capacity to be up to date in a land use change context to circumvent these technical limitations biotope modeling using available environmental predictors and remote sensing data is increasingly being developed horvath et al 2019 maggini et al 2006 this approach derived from species distribution modeling sdm produces relatively accurate maps of the current or the potential distribution of biotopes when taking into account land cover or not álvarez martínez et al 2018 horvath et al 2019 current and potential biotope distributions are also strategic information to design ecological networks biotope restoration can then target areas to increase species habitat patches and limit fragmentation impacts to compensate habitat loss due to human activities jones et al 2021 the interest and quality of biotope distribution modeling bdm is however limited because several biotopes can occupy similar ecological conditions soil climate and topography during the vegetation successions indeed plant communities characterizing biotopes evolve naturally from pioneer open biotopes to mature forest biotopes reaching one or several stages of equilibrium called climax niering 1987 different types of successional patterns are possible with dynamics of natural or artificial disturbances that for example restart the process of succession regressive dynamics lock in at certain stages etc blasi et al 2004 rees et al 2001 woodward 2009 bdm accuracy is thus disturbed by the competition between different biotopes belonging to the same succession in similar ecological conditions and the difficulty of having descriptive variables to discriminate the different stages some authors consider this issue by focusing only on climax stage biotopes horvath et al 2019 maggini et al 2006 the presence of some stages biotopes of a vegetation succession is also impacted by human management that restricts them to less productive areas such as the steepest slopes or the most superficial soils hall 1988 the observed relationship between some biotope distribution and environmental conditions therefore can only be one part of the potential biotope environmental niche one pragmatic solution to consider temporal dynamics of ecosystems is to use the concept of potential natural vegetation pnv pnv concept was defined by tuxen 1956 as the vegetation that would develop in a particular ecological zone or environment assuming the conditions of flora and fauna to be natural if the action of man on the vegetation mantle stopped and in the absence of substantial alteration in present climatic conditions gallizia vuerich et al 2001 by convention pnv therefore refer to climax vegetation but it designs the ecological conditions necessary for the development of the main stages of the associated succession loidi and fernández gonzález 2012 prach et al 2016 the concept of pnv allows to define landscape units that share similar ecological contexts regardless of the stage of natural vegetation succession leguédois et al 2011 stumpel and kalkhoven 1978 this concept was used in the past to classify landscapes to guide nature oriented sylviculture conservation and landscape planning de keersmaeker et al 2013 such pnv maps can also be used as one of multiple approaches to determine the conservation status or naturalness of areas by measuring the difference between pnv and current land cover hemsing and bryn 2012 or to identify gaps and completion of networks of protected areas such as natura 2000 bohn and gollub 2006 pnv mapping can be seen as an integrative approach that better considers vegetation dynamics which is important for the design and connectivity of ecological networks and their management it has the advantage of better delineating the maximum potential distribution of biotopes depending on the ecological context and therefore ensures network coherence it also helps to guide the management of conservation and restoration actions based on natural disturbance to create a more heterogeneous landscape however the expected link between pnv typology and ecological conditions is well debated among experts chiarucci et al 2010 pioneer or intermediate biotopes are sometimes shared by different vegetation succession series the dynamic drivers influencing a biotope to develop to a specific vegetation succession may be subtle variations in ecological factors and vegetation composition that are undetected in the field the result of biological processes competition and predation favoring certain species or the impact of direct management or indirect pollution eutrophication etc effects of present and past human activities however a lot of example of vegetation communities evolving to the expected climax exist thanks to a better understanding of these successions loidi and fernández gonzález 2012 prach et al 2016 the most important prerequisites to map pnv are therefore loidi and fernández gonzález 2012 1 a pnv typology that is sufficiently validated with quite exclusive biotopes belonging to each pnv 2 a validated mapping of the different biotopes belonging to each pnv 3 a precise mapping of ecological factors which are supposed to play an essential and proximal role in biotope distribution pnv mapping also benefited from the development of distribution modeling approaches and multiple examples of pnv modeling exist reger et al 2014 somodi et al 2017 recent studies addressed different topics such as the best modeling approach hemsing and bryn 2012 the representation of multiple overlapping modeled pnv somodi et al 2017 the definition of pnv de keersmaeker et al 2013 or the modeling of numerous pnv at larger liu et al 2009 and smaller scales longcore et al 2018 when pnv and related vegetation communities are well identified they are mainly based on national classification systems and models are calibrated on stable climax forest or open areas stages reference data hemsing and bryn 2012 building pnv based on species assemblage using floristic occurrence data is far more complex and raise many methodological questions de keersmaeker et al 2013 the presence of characteristic species is highly dependent of natural sites condition and some pnv may not have any highly characteristic species de keersmaeker et al 2013 the integration of multiple pnv predictions into a single map allows to better apprehend such useful results but current aggregation method are complex somodi et al 2017 on the other hand single biotope modeling i e peat bogs calcareous grasslands moors etc is still being applied horvath et al 2019 in the literature pnv concept seems to be a closed study field as many biotopes modeling study cases do not even mention pnv concept álvarez martínez et al 2018 horvath et al 2019 however and as mentioned earlier modeling pnv present many advantages to produce accurate and useful prediction map of biotopes in this paper we propose a methodological framework which aims to be as most replicable as possible using biotope classification systems and mapping used in all european countries in contrast to last pnv modeling applications using last stable forest stages we suggest modeling pnv using multiples biotopes from the same vegetation succession to better cover the ecological niches of pnv in disturbed landscapes our methodological framework also proposes a simpler aggregation technique to deliver a unique map of all pnv considering also potential overlaps we will also compare pnv modeling approach to individual biotope modeling and assess performance of both approaches finally we also suggest an independent qualitative assessment of modeled pnv distributions using floristic occurrence data 2

year however the precipitation can double within the territory from 800 to 1600 mm year and its rate increases with altitude the summit of the region is a high peaty plateau that culminates at 694 m above sea level the walloon region can be split into six principal parallel biogeographic zones that are well defined by a large gradient from recent to oldest geological substrates going from nw to se this explains a wide diversity of very different ecological contexts ranging from boreo alpine peatlands to mediterranean limestone lawns less than 30 km away dufrêne and legendre 1991 2 2 methodological framework the proposed approach was carried out in four steps 1 biotopes developing in the same ecological context were identified and referred to one specific pnv by using historic and recent expert knowledge to maximize the difference between pnv ecological contexts 2 pnv distributions were individually modeled using environmental predictors including topographic information soil conditions and climatic parameters 3 to obtain a unique typology for the territory pnv prediction maps were used as predictors to produce a classification to test the potential presence of the different pnv 4 finally overlaps between individually modeled pnv distributions were identified these mixed pnv areas allowed us to identify where the proposed classification is more uncertain the general workflow of our method is summarized in fig 1 2 3 pnv construction the biotope classification and denominations used in this study are based on the eunis european nature information system classification for biotope types davies et al 2004 eunis is a hierarchical classification describing every biotope and habitat present in europe from natural to artificial and covering terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems the eunis classification was adapted to wallonia by the public research agency in order to match regional variations dufrêne and delescaille 2005 each biotope is characterized by a unique code the pnv modeled in this study were identified to cover almost all ecological contexts of the region using phytosociological literature delescaille et al 2021 complemented by expert opinion the region has historically hosted several famous authors working on phytosociology and vegetation successions who precisely described the different vegetation stages their dynamics and links with ecological contexts making expert opinion highly robust duvigneaud 1949 herbauts and tanghe 1987 noirfalise 1984 venseveren 1969 common and scarce biotopes were selected if there was sufficient data to model them and if they belong to only one vegetation succession some open biotopes such as sub montane vaccinium and calluna heaths can evolve toward two different climax stages medio european acidophilous fagus forests and medio european thermophile acidophilous quercus forests and were therefore discarded biotopes corresponding to intensive agricultural practices or exotic tree plantations were also eliminated as they are not linked to a particular ecological condition all biotopes and pnv assignations are compiled in table 1 for further details appendix a presents all biotopes belonging to a pnv even if they are present in multiple pnv 2 4 environmental dataset belgium has the particularity to be covered by a large diversity of environmental datasets at high resolution for instance the country is covered by a soil dataset with detailed information on soil structure composition and humidity at a precise scale 1 10 000 bah et al 2007 more modern tools like digital elevation models based on lidar light detection and ranging are also available at high resolution 1m these precise environmental informations make it possible to better capture the relationship between environmental predictor and vegetation assemblages than it could be with generic and larger scale dataset such as soilgrids poggio et al 2021 the environmental variables used as predictors to model pnv distributions were split into three categories climatic variables soil dependent variables and topographic variables bioclimatic variables were extracted from high resolution 1 km² climate data derived from the downscaling of eurocordex regional climate model rcm datasets representing the historical climate between 1971 and 2005 and covering all europe de troch et al 2020 eurocordex rcm is considered as more spatially coherent at fine scale than widely used models such as worldclim or climate eu chakraborty et al 2021 this dataset proposes a subset of best climatic predictor for species distribution modeling and integrate original interesting climatic variable such as annual mean potential evapotranspiration soil related variables were principally extracted from the digital soil map of wallonia bah et al 2007 carte numérique des sols de wallonie série 2015 different soil types calcareous podzol organic sandy alluvial and source were stored as binary variables natural soil drainage drainage hydric level hydric lvl and trophic level trophic lvl were extracted as ordinal variables natural drainage was subdivided into 5 ordinal classes directly derived from the soil map dry and very dry soils moderately dry and wet soils wet soils with temporary water table very wet soils with temporary water table very wet and peaty soils two variables were derived from a dataset created to guide sylvicultural practices petit et al 2017 hydric level hydric lvl is a variable evaluating the humidity level of a soil based on the combination of natural drainage soil texture and topographic position trophic level trophic lvl is a variable quantifying the amount of nutrients available to the plants based on a dichotomous key using soil characteristics these cartographic data are available online in open access forestimator 2021 soil texture sand and silt proportions present in the soil were not available in soil maps but from another data source by performing a convolution between texture information from the walloon digital soil map and the kriging of more accurate and latest field observation points d or dimitri 2021 these are continuous variables with the proportion of sand and silt measured at a 50 m resolution finally topographic continuous variables included elevation elevation slope percentage slope prc topographic position index calculated in a 200 m radius normalized from 0 to 100 tpi and the potential incident light energy in w m² for the first day of spring sunspring these predictors are derived from 1 m lidar acquisition resampled at 10 m and produced for the study purpose relief de la wallonie modèle numérique de surface mns 2013 2014 hillshade 2015 the radiative subsector radiative ss and the potential water intake water int are categorical variables constructed with dichotomous keys based on relative position slope and exposure to guide sylvicultural practices petit et al 2017 they are also available online in open access forestimator 2021 predictors used in this study have different resolutions ranging from 1 km for climate data to 10 m for topographic ones we chose to resample all predictors to 10 m resolution to match the finest resolution as it is recommended by the literature as the better solution to perform accurate models moudrý et al 2023 autocorrelation was tested to conserve independent variables for modeling elevation and all climatic variables except the annual variation of precipitation annualvariationprecipitation showed a pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 7 or lower than 0 7 and were considered to be strongly correlated ratner 2009 but bioclimatic variables are considered of high biological significance influencing plant and species distribution bede fazekas and somodi 2020 they were summarized by using the two main principal component axes resulting from a principal component analysis pca climatic pca 1 and climatic pca 2 to limit correlation but keep the maximum amount of information 88 and 10 of explained variance this use of multivariate analysis to create a composite predictor has already been used and give convincing results in species and ecosystem distribution modeling ejrnæs 2000 santos et al 2020 simensen et al 2020 normality of each variable was tested and values were transformed if necessary slope percentage and annual variation of precipitation were transformed with a logarithmic function in total 19 environmental predictors were kept for modeling table 2 areas not described in soil maps i e urban areas watercourses and parts of military domains were not considered in the model they appear as no data on maps presented in this paper 2 5 vegetation data as part of the implementation of the european union council directive 92 43 eec on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora loidi 1999 detailed mapping of biotopes has been carried out by the different member states field biotope inventories realized in the walloon region between 2005 and 2020 as part of the implementation of this directive were used as a reference dataset for pnv biotope limits were identified as polygons mapped at 1 10 000 and each of them is characterized by a eunis code this field mapping is performed using dichotomous keys based on vegetation structure and species assemblage to identify eunis biotopes limits of biotopes are drawn using national geographic maps to differentiate open areas from forest and digital soil maps are used to refine limits identified on the field precise biotope mapping is not published and was provided directly by the public service in charge spw dgarne demna as natural vegetation rarely follows tangible limits the change from one biotope to another is not always a sharp edge but rather a continuous local gradient kuchler 1973 transitions and mosaics between biotopes can also be complicated and difficult to map field survey agents address this problem by identifying and mapping complexes of several biotopes which are intertwined dufrêne and delescaille 2007 hearn et al 2011 those complexes may negatively affect a model s accuracy by decreasing strong differences between ecological conditions of biotopes and were therefore discarded horvath et al 2019 we therefore only selected polygons containing a unique eunis code that could be linked to a pnv following table 1 covering 65 599 ha to limit the imprecision of biotope and ecological variable mapping we shrank biotope polygons greater than 1 ha corresponding to more widespread pnv with a 20 m inner buffer fammenian quercus and carpinus forests neutrophile fagus forests acidophilous fagus forests and calcareous fagus and quercus forests are the most widespread biotopes in wallonia delescaille et al 2021 the area covered by theses pnv potentially affected by errors and polygon limit inaccuracies is not negligible compared to scarcer biotope areas which are more typical of extreme ecological conditions the rarest biotopes have been subject to more precise mapping because nearly all are biotopes of community interest sensu the european habitat directive defining aims of natura 2000 network loidi 1999 they are also easily delineable on the ground this step of shrinking the most widespread biotopes improved the quality of scarcer biotope models modified biotope polygons were then used to link each pnv to every cell of the environmental predictor raster stack that falls into them to reduce the spatial autocorrelation effect we applied a random spatial sampling to select a maximum of 50 pixels per km² for each pnv that reduced the dataset to approximately 200 000 rows 5 of the complete dataset this sampling helped to initially balance the distribution of pnv occurrences by limiting those dominating the landscape the evolution of pnv areas following the different sampling steps is available in appendix b 2 6 individual pnv modeling a first modeling step was performed for each pnv with presence absence data the presence of a pnv was attributed to each pixel where an eunis habitat associated to the pnv have been mapped on the field all other eunis habitat associated to other pnv were considered as absence horvath et al 2019 maggini et al 2006 we could have used presence only models such as maxent álvarez martínez et al 2018 but the way pnv were defined with unambiguous biotopes related to specific ecological context made it possible to perform robust presence absence models models were calibrated through a random forest algorithm using the randomforest r package breiman 2001 random forest algorithm is recognized for its accuracy and its computational efficiency it can easily handle small sample size and high dimension models which make it perfect to model scarce pnv biau and scornet 2016 random forest is also known to be less sensitive to overfitting when calibrated with large sample size which is interesting in our case for common pnv belgiu and drăguţ 2016 finally random forest performs for both regression and classification that make it versatile enough for our methodological framework achieving individual modeling and global classification without complexifying the method biau and scornet 2016 the model was calibrated using 70 of the selected presence absence dataset on this calibration dataset a smote synthetic minority oversampling technique algorithm was applied to balance presence absence frequency without losing too much information chawla et al 2002 the smote algorithm decreases dominant class generally absences and artificially increases the minority class generally presences before modeling a variable selection was performed on the calibration dataset using vsurf variable selection using random forest genuer et al 2015 all variables selected at the prediction step of the vsurf algorithm were kept for modeling random forest model tuning focused on the mtry argument i e the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split as it is considered to be the most influential parameter probst et al 2019 multiple tests were performed to choose the best mtry value giving low error and less computational time these tests resulted in the use of the square root of the number of variables kept after selection which corresponds to what is found in the literature probst et al 2019 model results were first validated using the 30 remaining test set the area under the curve auc was used to evaluate model robustness using this test set a second validation was performed on the 95 dataset discarded by spatial sampling to measure the accuracy of predictive maps different accuracy metrics were calculated in order to compare predictive maps and assess their adequacy the overall accuracy oa the producer accuracy pa and the user accuracy ua oa is the proportion of well classified pixels presence and absence compared to the total number of pixels used for validation pa is the proportion of correctly classified reference pixels compared to the total number of reference pixel that represent the point of view of the cartographer evaluating the model prediction ua is the proportion of well classified presence pixels compared to the total number of predicted presences this evaluates the model performance to predict pnv presence from the point of view of the map user for these threshold dependent metrics oa pa and ua the threshold maximizing the f score was used to transform model probability to presence absence the f score is the harmonic mean of the receiver operating characteristic roc curve the five most important environmental predictors for the random forest model and their importance for the model were also identified based on the gini index aldrich 2020 2 7 dominant pnv classification a second modeling step was performed using results of each pnv prediction as an input for a new random forest classification to produce a unique classification map of pnv results of specific pnv probabilities cannot be compared to identify what the dominant pnv is for a pixel specific pnv probabilities are average results from multiple specific classification trees with specific distributions of values however they can be used as variables for a new classification that will identify the most likely pnv for each pixel based on pnv probabilities the smote algorithm can only be performed on a two class dataset to balance the different pnv frequencies before modeling we decided to weight pnv classes as this is the recommended approach to balance a dataset for random forest classification of more than two classes while keeping all the information chen and breiman 2004 we weighted pnv classes according to their prevalence by applying eq 1 to each class 1 w e i g h t 1 f r e q c l a s s 2 where f r e q c l a s s is the proportion of the class i e the pnv this helped to give more weight to less represented pnv for instance the weight of the rare xerophile fammenian quercus and carpinus forests is 0 99 while the weight of the common acidophilous fagus forests is 0 53 the same oa pa and ua metrics used for the specific pnv modeling were calculated we also calculated the cohen s kappa coefficient that measures the global accuracy of a classification comparing the proportion of well classified pixels to the total number of pixels compared to a random classifier to interpret cohen s kappa coefficient results we used the classification proposed by landis and koch 1977 that consider a kappa value below 0 2 as slight between 0 21 and 0 40 as fair between 0 41 and 0 60 as moderate between 0 61 and 0 80 as substantially good and above 0 81 as an almost perfect classifier 2 8 identification of areas with mixed pnv as previously explained biotope distributions do not follow tangible and exclusive limits in the field gradients and complexes of multiple biotopes are common where biotope environmental niches overlap dominant pnv classification attributes to each pixel the dominant pnv even in less ecologically specific areas where multiple pnv could overlap in order to get closer to reality and identify less certain classified areas we chose to identify areas where several pnv are in competition to do so predictive distributions of each individual pnv were transformed to binary presence absence maps using the threshold maximizing f score these binary maps were therefore all added together and areas where the presence of multiple pnv overlapped were considered as mixed areas the area of each type of pnv present in mixed areas has been measured and compared to the total area of the concerned pnv if the mixed area represented more than 10 of the total surface of one pnv in question it was kept those below 10 were discarded this allowed most pnv associated with important confusion after classification to be kept discarding small and irrelevant confusion issues all retained mixed areas were added to the pnv classification map as an overlay then we recalculated accuracy metrics for each pnv with validation data by considering the potential presence of the pnv in single and mixed areas mixed areas were therefore considered as a presence for the validation of each pnv concerned 2 9 complementary analysis 2 9 1 individual biotope modeling vs pnv to identify gains or losses of using the pnv approach compared to individual biotope modeling that consider biotopes independent as it is commonly applied horvath et al 2019 maggini et al 2006 we also performed modeling of biotopes composing the pnv for calcareous fagus and quercus forests we chose this pnv as it includes several biotopes of different succession stages that are exclusive to the pnv it is also the only one with sufficient data about open and semi open biotopes to enable accurate and robust individual models biotopes belonging to calcareous fagus and quercus forest succession were modeled considering the targeted biotope as presences and all other biotopes of the dataset i e also other biotopes belonging to the same pnv as absences as is done in individual biotope modeling approaches horvath et al 2019 all independent models were used to predict presence absence maps using the threshold maximizing f score to make individual biotope models and the pnv model comparable we added together all biotopes predicted ranges which was compared to the pnv predicted presence range producer accuracy was calculated for each individual biotope i e the proportion of reference pixels related to each biotope belonging to the pnv or the cumulative biotope distributions furthermore each total area of the pnv predicted presence and the cumulative individual biotope predicted presence were calculated to evaluate the specificity of the model a presence prediction that is too large can increase producer accuracy but the model specificity may be low 2 9 2 quality assessment with floristic data indicator plant species observations were also used to complete the quality assessment of pnv predictions using an independent dataset to the one used for model calibration a validated plant dataset compiled for the walloon flora atlas delescaille and delaitte 2011 was filtered to keep only observations of indigenous plants between 2000 and 2020 and location with precision below 100 m pnv information was then assigned to each observation of a plant species a chi² test was performed to measure the dependence between the presence of a plant taxa and each specific pnv discarding mixed pnv the dependence is based on residual chi² t calculated with eq 2 2 t i j o i j e i j 2 e i j where o i j is the number of observations of a taxon i in a pnv j and e i j is calculated based on eq 3 3 e i j o i o j n where o i is the total number of observations for a taxon o j is the total number of observations in a pnv and n is the total number of observations in all pnv chi² test was preferred to similar metric such as indval dufrêne legendre 1997 indeed using indval to compare species occurrence to pnv prediction should results to low values of indicative level as it depends on the proportion of species occurrence on pnv occurrences pnv occurrences is far wider than species occurences as it is a potential prediction and could not be compared to species occurrence that are linked to actual distribution of biotopes 3 results 3 1 dominant pnv classification pnv were firstly modeled individually using the random forest algorithm accuracy metrics results and an example of resulting map are available in appendix c random forest prediction results were then used as independent predictors to perform a classification to identify the dominant pnv for each pixel results of accuracy metrics table 3 show that global accuracy metrics for the classification are almost perfect with 0 95 and 0 91 for oa and cohen s kappa coefficient respectively if we go into further detail we can see that the classification increases producer accuracy for almost all pnv the pa increase is particularly important for 5 pnv out of 13 with an increase higher than 10 the results for ua are more heterogeneous with some pnv gaining in ua and others decreasing two pnv particularly lost accuracy according to ua riparian and gallery woodland and alnus swamp woods to better understand these accuracy losses we performed a confusion matrix that highlights an important confusion between the predicted value for some pnv and reference pixels of acidophilous fagus forests table 4 this is particularly the case in decreasing order of confusion importance for thermophile acidophilous quercus forests acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils alnus swamp woods riparian and gallery woodland quercus and betula forests with molinia and wet and shady ravine forests all these pnv are scarce except for quercus and betula forests with molinia and riparian and gallery woodland we can also see a notable confusion between wet and shady ravine forests and calcareous fagus and quercus forests fig 2 shows the results of classification as a unique map of pnv potential presence results of pnv individual modeling and classification can be viewed online lifewatch fwb ucl geomatics 2022 3 2 identification of areas with mixed potential natural vegetation the identification of potential zones with competition between pnv resulted to ten mixed pnv complexes where the sum of pnv proportions is higher than 10 it appears that pnv concerned with mixed areas representing a large proportion of their presence range are generally those with a lot of overlay as shown in the confusion matrix this is particularly the case for scarcer pnv such as thermophile acidophilous quercus forests acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils and xerophile fammenian quercus and carpinus forests there is an important overlap between neutrophile fagus forests and acidophilous fagus forests involving 30 of neutrophile fagus forests this overlap is not present in the classification as there is not a notable confusion between the two pnv in the confusion matrix accuracy metrics were recalculated considering the potential presence of pnv in mixed areas global results were logically better with a slight decrease of pa in some cases and an appreciable increase of ua for almost all pnv oa slightly increased by 0 004 while kappa increased by 0 019 the list of mixed pnv an example of maps with both pnv and mixed pnv such as trends in accuracy metrics with and without mixed areas are available in appendix d 3 3 complementary analysis 3 3 1 individual biotope modeling vs pnv results of the modeling of the calcareous fagus and quercus forests pnv were compared to the remodeling of each of the biotopes that characterize the vegetation succession of this pnv results are presented in table 5 we can see that pa values were low for individual biotope predictions except for sub atlantic calciphile quercus and carpinus betulus forests the pa values increased when biotope predictions were grouped but the pnv approach performs better for all biotopes except for sub atlantic calciphile quercus carpinus betulus forests where the difference is only 0 4 in other words more biotope reference pixels were encompassed in the pnv range than in the addition of individual biotope predicted presences this represents a mean pa increase of 29 compared to individual biotope predictions and 8 compared to when they are grouped in addition areas of grouped biotope predictions and pnv are similar with 30 250 ha for the pnv and 25 250 ha for the addition of individual biotopes model the large pa for the pnv approach is therefore not due to an excessively large potential distribution 3 3 2 quality assessment with floristic data an additional validation of the pnv models assessed to what extent most dependent species of each pnv based on chi² are known to be indicators of the different related biotopes chi² analyses were performed on plant occurrence data using a pnv classification map to identify most dependent species without considering aquatic species and very rare species appendix e summarized in table 6 most dependent species resulting from chi² analyses are generally indicative or related to biotopes concerned by the modeled pnv species characteristic of both open and forest stages of the pnv are present in the five most dependent species for open habitats species this is true for helianthemum nummularium that is indicative of open stages of calcareous fagus and quercus forests or erica tetralix typical of open stages of quercus and betula forests with molinia for forest species asplenium scolopendrium that is typical of forest stages of wet and shady ravine forests or luzula luzuloides that is present in forest stages of acidophilous fagus forests two pnv had poorer results neutrophile quercus and fraxinus forests on wet soils and acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils some species of these two pnv highlighted by the analysis are not related to the expected environmental conditions 4 discussion 4 1 pnv modeling performance the modeling of individual and dominant pnv showed very convincing results the results of accuracy metrics were good to excellent with extremely high oa and kappa values these results can be explained by the contrasted definition of pnv related to the main ecological context of the study area the diversity of specific ecological conditions covered by the different pnv would favor the prediction of true absences increasing oa other studies modeling biotope distributions have also found better accuracy metric values for the rarest biotopes horvath et al 2019 however these studies only used the auc which is also influenced by true presence and absences as do many studies dealing with single biotope models maggini et al 2006 or pnv modeling hemsing and bryn 2012 however using true absence rate may lead to a false assumption that model results are good and especially concerning scarce biotope pnv indeed for scarce biotope pnv depending on specific ecological context class imbalance between presence and absence data will favor true absence rate pa and ua metrics based principally on true presence showed that results are more nuanced and that attention must be paid with some predicted pnv to model pnv we assumed a deterministic evolution of vegetation succession toward a climax stage which is not agreed upon by all the scientific community chiarucci et al 2010 we therefore paid attention to pnv definition and identifying biotopes belonging to each pnv our results showed a good distinction between the different pnv which proves they were well ecologically defined and that our hypothesis about a deterministic evolution of vegetation succession could be validated furthermore these results underline the benefits and sturdiness of a prior definition of pnv compared to more complex methods where pnv are constructed based on vegetation occurrence datasets de keersmaeker et al 2013 however the existence of mixed areas shows some important overlaps between independent pnv predictions nevertheless modeling pnv has many advantages presented in this paper that brings new light to this old concept classification results to identify dominant pnv had an important global pa increase at the expense of ua which shows that the modeled distribution of pnv had been widened after classification this is especially the case for riparian and gallery woodlands and alnus swamp woods a detailed analysis of the confusion matrix performed on classification results revealed a significant confusion between acidophilous fagus forests and scarcer pnv acidophilous fagus forests is the largest of all pnv representing 64 of reference data and its high prevalence in the validation dataset could also explain why prediction errors are more widely detected in widespread biotopes even if areas of confusion between acidophilous fagus forests and other pnv are small and rare compared to acidophilous fagus forests total area the impact on accuracy metrics may still be significant for the rarest pnv for which less validation data is available this confusion can be explained by different factors both predictor maps such as soil maps and biotope data used for calibration are derived from human interpretation which means that the representation and simplification on a cartographic medium contributes to confusion between pnv secondly fagus forests are the natural dominant vegetation on the walloon territory and can sometimes extend at the border of their range this effect is accentuated by fagus sylvativca competitiveness toward other species homogenization of stands by silvicultural management and high game pressure on less common tree species thirdly biotopes present in scarce pnv depend to their specific ecological conditions that have a spatial pattern defined by topography and hydrography generating many edges therefore the extraction of rasterized environmental predictors of 10 m wide may have created border effects where predictor values of specific ecological conditions may be attributed to the scarce pnv or to the surrounding common pnv this issue has been considered to define the reference data set and its impact limited by removing a 20 m inside buffer from common pnv polygons fourthly more common biotope maps are susceptible to mask scarcer ones as the mapping of common biotopes may be coarser they can include smaller areas with ecological conditions suitable to other pnv a detailed analysis of the acidophilous fagus forests reference data showed that a bigger proportion of riparian and gallery woodlands reference polygons are on wet alluvial soils 43 than that of acidophilous fagus forests 1 but the latter has a greater absolute area of wet alluvial soil 83 398 ha than riparian and gallery woodlands 47 972 ha this issue was anticipated by balancing calibration datasets firstly with spatial sampling and secondly by weighting pnv before classification by giving more importance to scarce pnv we also gave more importance to biotope polygons for which we can have better confidence as more attention was given to them during their mapping 4 2 individual biotope versus pnv modeling the analysis of the independent biotope models of calcareous fagus and quercus forests showed that pnv approach better covers the existing biotope distributions compared to single biotope modeling furthermore pnv modeling using only climax stage vegetation as reference would have used medio european limestone fagus forests delescaille et al 2021 however we can see that using this vegetation alone to model the pnv leads to missing 20 more cells of this biotope than our approach for this example using several biotopes of the succession stage to calibrate the pnv better encompass ecological niche and leads to better predictive results the better results of our approach can be explained by the fact that open biotopes are maintained by human management in our case only a part of them have resumed their succession and another part had their natural succession blocked or brought back to the starting point by human activities our hypothesis is that human activity restricts the distribution of open biotopes to more extreme local ecological contexts that could be only a limited part of the actual ecological niche of the biotope by modeling calcareous fagus and quercus forest pnv we therefore better consider the ecological niche of sub atlantic semi dry calcareous grassland as evidenced by our results 4 3 quality assessment with floristic data quality control of the potential distribution of pnv using floristic data demonstrates that the most dependent pnv species are those that are found in corresponding biotope floristic assemblages delescaille et al 2021 most important issues revealed by this analysis concern neutrophile quercus and fraxinus forests on wet soils and acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils however this can be explained by too low accuracy of available observations poorer sampling inside the biotopes concerned and inherent pnv scarcity especially acidophilous quercus and carpinus forests on wet soils that impact chi² analysis 4 4 strength and limitations of the approach our approach helped to tackle different issues related to biotope mapping in our case biotopes that are part of other vegetation series were therefore considered as true absences which improved the model s capacity to distinguish them the use of independent models for each pnv to produce a classification as well as the distinction of the mixed zones allowed potential pnv distributions to be refined important pa values for classification and the small change in ua showed that this model was very powerful avoiding omitting the presence of different pnv while keeping a good detection of true presences other approaches have allowed a map to be built with the most dominant biotope from multiple predictions álvarez martínez et al 2018 but the probabilities between two concurrent biotopes were compared and the dominant biotope was assigned to the pixel if the difference of probabilities was higher than a subjective threshold in our approach any subjectivity was avoided through the classification based on individual pnv predictions other methods of biotope modeling may also be followed initiated by margules and stein 1989 vegetation communities could also be considered based on the combined potential distribution of species belonging to the community this approach could be adapted to aim modeling vegetation communities as we did it has the advantage that it could now be performed on vegetation observation from naturalist platforms these data are numerous regularly completed and a large majority are validated however species observations suffer from many problems related to the sampling quality and nature of biological data the data collected rarely follow a standardized methodology they are often spatially biased in favor of the most accessible or attractive areas of a territory such as protected areas biotope mapping is in principle more standardized and systematic and one can trust the absence of a biotope where another has been mapped which is not the case for the presence of a species species location is also not exempt of errors of different types while biotopes delineation corresponds to a combination of regularly observed species and a particular combination of ecological factors but one major problem is the nature of the distribution of species data that cannot in principle share the same ecological niche that characterizes a biotope rare species that are specific of environmental conditions are very difficult to model because their absence can be explained by local ecological factors not measurable at the size of the selected grid 10 10m biotic factors particular adaptation strategies factors associated with the dispersal filter human activities while most frequent species are less indicative and are therefore also generally observed in other combinations of ecological conditions the identification of mixed pnv areas revealed the difficult distinction and blurred delimitation between different pnv where ecological conditions are very close these mixed areas are mainly distributed in the areas most disturbed by human activities and have fewer biotopes of reference for model calibration these transitional areas between different biotopes reflect those typically encountered in the field other methods to tackle overlapping of multiple pnv predictions are complex and do not provide convenient maps but give a more complete information with different comparable probabilities for all overlapping pnv somodi et al 2017 our approach is simpler and we discard some complexes but all information is available in a single convenient map moreover marginal complexes of pnv that were discarded are mainly unrealistic in term of ecological condition that should not overlap 4 5 potential use of pnv map for nature protection and conservation pnv modeling can identify possible priority areas for biotope restoration the new european biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the new european regulation on nature restoration defined very ambitious objectives of surface to protect and conservation status to improve as they concern the implementation of the natura 2000 network and many biotopes of european interest see table 1 pnv modeling make it possible to assess the extent of restoration possibilities and to identify the highest priority areas for increasing existing surfaces or for improving connectivity between them within a pnv the distinction between forest and open biotopes can then be identified using available land cover data which is becoming increasingly accurate and easily available through remote sensing approaches bourdouxhe et al 2020 radoux et al 2019 the use of land use and land cover data in the pnv allows for targeted field sampling of the most potentially interesting areas to complete the mapping of the core areas of biodiversity the pnv concept also allows for the development of much more dynamic approaches to nature

24212,the injection of seawater into a hydrocarbon reservoir seawater flooding as an oil recovery method triggers microbial reservoir souring through which microorganisms consume sulfate ions and produce hydrogen sulfide which is hazardous corrosive and detrimental to the environment if enters production wells a strategy to mitigate this problem is to add nitrate or nitrite to the injection seawater also known as nitrate or nitrite treatment this study investigates nitrate treatment in a simulated real world sector scale hydrocarbon reservoir in the danish north sea through a non isothermal multi phase multi component bio chemical model and field observations the common expectation is that the higher the concentration of nitrate or nitrite in the injection seawater the less hydrogen sulfide production however the results of this study show that slowing down the microorganisms or mitigation through nitrate treatment may cause higher hydrogen sulfide production from production wells put differently not only the total amount of hydrogen sulfide generated inside the reservoir matters but also the location of the generation zone and its distance from production wells matter therefore it is possible that insufficient amounts of nitrate cause the generation zone to move toward the production wells hence more hydrogen sulfide is produced during the lifetime of the reservoir moreover considering laboratory and field scale measurements in the presence of coupled multi physics processes the growth rates at the field scale are significantly lower than those observed in the laboratory experiments under in situ conditions utilizing actual reservoir fluid samples graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords souring mitigation hydrogen sulfide souring field observation sulfate reducing bacteria nitrate reducing bacteria reactive transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a challenge associated with water flooding subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs is microbial reservoir souring mainly due to the lower temperature of the injection water compared to that of a deep reservoir and the high concentrations of sulfate ion so4 2 in the injection water a suitable situation is created for sulfate reducing bacteria srbs to reduce sulfate and produce hydrogen sulfide h2s reaction 1 in table s1 which is a corrosive and hazardous gas with detrimental environmental effects al janabi 2020 mahmoodi et al 2022 mitchell et al 2021 microbial sulfate reduction has been reported to take place in various environments liu et al 2015 parthipan et al 2023 one mitigation strategy for microbial reservoir souring is the addition of nitrate ions no3 to the injection water there are various mechanisms through which the presence of nitrate can mitigate souring first the heterotrophic reduction of nitrate through nitrate reducing bacteria nrbs consumes dissolved organic carbon doc which is required for sulfate reduction through srbs reaction 2 in table s1 in this way the amount of doc could be limited for souring also known as bio competition xue and voordouw 2015 agrawal et al 2012 second the reduction of nitrate produces nitrite no2 which has a direct inhibitory effect on the activity of srbs veshareh et al 2021 it is also worth noting that there are nrbs that can reduce nitrite to nitrogen reaction 3 in table s1 consuming even more of the doc and thus contribute to bio competition on doc consumption third nitrate nitrite reducing sulfide oxidizing bacteria nrsobs are able to reduce nitrate or nitrite and oxidize sulfide back to sulfate reactions 4 and 5 in table s1 and potentially elemental sulfur jahanbani veshareh and nick 2019 qi et al 2022 veshareh et al 2021 finally some srbs are able to use alternative terminal electron acceptors to sulfate such as sulfonates nitrate nitrite iron and manganese marietou 2016 this suggests that with the presence of nitrate or nitrite in the environment some srbs may switch to the more energy efficient nitrate or nitrite reduction instead of sulfate reduction eckford and fedorak 2002 eckford and fedorak 2002 in the real world however dosages of 70 and 120 ppm of a 45 calcium nitrate solution have been used in different fields often without a good technical reason whilst levels of souring have continued to rise mitchell et al 2021 these amounts of nitrate may be efficient in laboratory setups but the full scale reservoir may show a different behavior especially because of the higher duration of the time that sulfate and nitrate and or nitrite are present in the reservoir before they reach the production wells moreover it is a common expectation that the higher the concentration of nitrate or nitrite in the injection seawater the better the treatment however considering the distance between hydrogen sulfide generation zone inside the reservoir and the location of the production wells this expectation could be wrong this calls for the study of souring in field scale reservoir models with the purpose of more reliable predictions and re visiting the common understanding of the impact of nitrate treatment on h2s production understanding the role of coupled processes in real systems is key to design safe and effective mitigation solutions we approach this issue through combining the observed field data with a novel workflow coupled with multi physics simulation to study the underlaying mechanisms that drive a nitrate treatment ineffective or detrimental we utilize reactive transport modeling to investigate souring and nitrate mitigation in a large sector of a hydrocarbon field in the danish north sea in this study the results of the simulation cases are compared to the field observations then the intensity of reservoir souring is compared to the amount of produced h2s from the production wells and the propagation of h2s plume inside the porous media of the reservoir this study allows re assessing the current mitigation solutions applied 2 methods a non isothermal multi component bio chemical model has been developed to couple with a reservoir simulator and simulate microbial reservoir souring in subsurface reservoirs the microbial reactions and the governing laws and input values to compute their kinetics are taken from cheng et al 2016 whose model has been validated against the experimental data of engelbrektson et al 2014 table s1 furthermore the effect of temperature on the growth rate of bacteria has been added based on the work of rosso et al 1995 table s2 moreover the composition of formation brine and seawater were set to resemble the case of this study based on cheng et al 2016 and vigneron et al 2017 table s3 notably although a microbial guild can comprise various strains of microorganisms with various specifications only one microbial strain for each of the functions sulfate reduction nitrate nitrite reduction and nitrate nitrite reduction sulfide oxidation has been considered in this study cheng et al 2018 moreover biofilm generation inside the porous media has been neglected in this work but it can have an effect in the flow and bioavailability d acunto et al 2019 sanderlin et al 2013 in this work we introduce a correction factor to the monod equation γ in equation 5 in the supplementary material which includes the combined effect of bioavailability bacterial mobility mixing nutrients and temperature front and heterogeneity from pore to grid block scale micrometers to tens of meters these effects decrease the effective growth rates r e f f used for field scale modeling through the availability of nutrients or the variations in the environment within a large grid block hesse et al 2010 gharasoo et al 2012 heße et al 2009 carrera et al 2022 tartakovsky et al 2009 in reality the γ factor is a function of time and space however in this work for the sake of simplicity a constant γ has been assumed to be used to match the history of the field with the model a sector of a hydrocarbon field in the danish north sea has been selected to investigate microbial reservoir souring and the effectiveness of nitrate treatment the sector comprises 3 horizontal production wells and 2 horizontal injection wells in between them figure s1 the middle production well is the target of this study the black oil reservoir model had already been created in the commercial reservoir simulator eclipse 100 and history matched against field production data then the souring model was run reading the output of the reservoir simulation the flowchart of the coupling method is depicted in figure s2 two cases of no treatment and a continuous addition of 50 mg l of nitrate to the injection seawater as the souring treatment strategy are investigated for four different values of γ very low low medium and high r e f f correspond to γ values of 10 5 10 4 5 10 4 and 1 respectively for all microbial pathways a detailed description of possible pathways can be found in our previous publications jahanbani veshareh and nick 2019 veshareh and nick 2021 for the sake of simplicity we consider fixed μ m a x values for all microbes our workflow however can capture multiple μ m a x for microorganisms with different functions that have various trophic conditions and thus their maximum specific growth rates may also vary veshareh and nick 2021 the mathematical model and kinetic and thermodynamic parameters have been introduced in the supplementary material 3 results and discussions the results of this study are presented in two sections first the effect of the intensity of microbial activities effective growth rate of microorganisms is studied and then the effect of a continuous addition of 50 mg l of nitrate to the injection water on each of the cases is discussed 3 1 effective growth rate r e f f expectedly the total amount of h2s generated inside the reservoir decreases as effective growth rate decreases fig 1 a in case of high effective growth rate the microorganisms consume all the sulfate injected with the seawater before any of it reaches the production well which does not fit the sulfate production data at all fig 1c therefore the complete conversion of seawater sulfate is not the case for the studied field in such case the maximum total amount of h2s would be generated inside the reservoir meaning sulfate would be the limiting factor it goes without saying that the total amount of generated hydrogen sulfide inside the reservoir is not measurable in practice on the other hand the concentration of h2s in the produced gas from the production well shows an unexpected trend expectedly in the early stages of production e g before 2014 when comparing very low and high effective growth rates in fig 1b the h2s concentration in the production fluids is lower in case of lower effective growth rates i e slower microbial activities the main reason here is that it takes more time for the microbial community to grow large enough to be able to reduce a considerable amount of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide before reaching the production well when the effective growth rates are lower however with decreasing the effective growth rate from high to medium and from medium to low higher hydrogen sulfide content is predicted to be present in the produced gas from the production well after a long time nevertheless with a further decrease of effective growth rate from low to very low less hydrogen sulfide will be produced from the production well fig 1b looking at the visualized reservoir fig 2 one can readily notice the size of h2s plume inside the reservoir in the high effective growth rate case despite higher concentrations of h2s a smaller plume of h2s is formed hence most of the generated h2s inside the reservoir is yet far away from the production well nevertheless as the effective growth rate decreases despite lower average concentrations of h2s in the medium a bigger plume has been created which has already reached the production well fig 2c consequently as the effective growth rate decreases the h2s concentration around the production well first increases because the h2s plume reaches the production well earlier i e h2s generation zone in the reservoir is closer to the production well and then decreases because the concentration in the plume of h2s decreases enough to reverse the trend fig 1b this observation gives rise to the concern that a good match between the simulation results and the field data with h2s concentration in the produced gas may result in very misleading interpretations about the real effective growth rates of microbial activity e g the high and low effective growth rate cases have somewhat similar results in this sense in fig 1b that is the first reason why it is necessary to confirm simulation results in a way other than fitting on hydrogen sulfide concentration in the produced gas furthermore the concentration of produced hydrogen sulfide was measured in the gas phase at separator conditions however the measured field data the blue circles in fig 1b is probably heavily affected by gas lift which is the injected gas into the production well with the purpose of lowering pressure drop along the wellbore unfortunately no reliable data on the injection rate and h2s concentration in the injected lift gas is available for the case of this study based on the non reliable data the lift gas in this case contains quite high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide above 100 ppmv since based on simulation results the h2s content in the gas coming from microbial activities inside the reservoir is expected to be considerably lower than that until 2018 the uncertainty in the lift gas data could fade out the h2s concentrations coming from the reservoir and thus it is not reliable to match the history of measured field data with the simulation results that is the second reason why it is necessary to match the history with other measurements it is worth noting that there could be some possible methods of validation such as drilling monitoring wells to measure h2s concentrations in a location closer to the injection well or installing downhole permanent sensors which have not been done for the case of this study in this work sulfate concentration in the produced water is chosen for matching the history since microbial reservoir souring may heavily affect the sulfate concentration response in the production well it is assumed that the sulfate concentration in the produced water has a one to one relationship with the intensity of souring which omits the complexity of h2s data in produced fluids put differently the slower the microbial activities the higher sulfate from the injection seawater reaches the production well thus higher concentrations of sulfate are produced fig 1c indeed other mechanisms that could possibly affect the concentration of sulfate ion in the reservoir e g barite scale formation are assumed to have a negligible effect compared to microbial souring the simulation results of the high effective growth rate case with a correction factor of γ 1 shows no proper agreement with the field data fig 1c compared to the field data the simulation results of this case predict much lower concentrations of sulfate ions in the produced water implying a total consumption of injected sulfate with the seawater however the simulation cases with lower effective growth rates start to behave more like the field data indeed in this specific sector model it is still uncertain what value for the correction factor of the effective growth rate would match best with the field data note the few cases in fig 1c that match the history however it is safe to say that the case of low effective growth rate with nitrate treatment and the cases of very low effective growth rate with or without nitrate treatment better match the field data compared to the other cases it is worth noting that there are other production wells in the same field that show a more characteristic behavior in their sulfate concentration in the produced water more like the behavior of the low effective growth rate case in fig 1c how early the sulfate concentration curve in the produced water of a well would show such a characteristic behavior is probably dependent on how long it takes for how much of the injection seawater to reach the production well 3 2 nitrate treatment for the case of high effective growth rate the addition of 50 mg l of nitrate to the injection seawater has a small effect on the total amount of h2s inside the reservoir whereas the same treatment results in a considerably lower total amount of h2s inside the reservoir for medium low and very low effective growth rates fig 1a in case of high effective growth rates the nitrate is mostly consumed in the vicinity of the injection well and there is still time for the sulfate reducers fast in this case to almost fully consume the sulfate and produce hydrogen sulfide for the medium effective growth rate case it takes more time for the nrbs and nrsobs to consume all the nitrate therefore by the time nitrate is fully consumed the srbs slower than the previous case do not have enough time to consume as much sulfate as they would have without the treatment in case of low and very low effective growth rates nitrate is never fully consumed i e some nitrate reach the production well and thus the slow srbs have no time to consume a considerable amount of sulfate fig 1c looking back at the h2s concentrations in the produced gas from the production well fig 1b in case of high and medium effective growth rates a complex behavior is observed before 2018 the nitrate treatment shows a positive effect while after 2018 more h2s is produced from the production well due to an insufficiently effective nitrate treatment compared to the cases with no nitrate treatment this is a consequence of a shift in the h2s generation zone inside the reservoir toward the production well therefore it is possible that a non sufficient amount of nitrate in the injection seawater even increases the concentration of h2s in the produced fluids in such a case the planned cessation of production time is of importance meaning if the plan was to stop production from the well before 2018 the effect of such treatment would be positive otherwise such nitrate treatment causes more h2s produced from production wells this is in accordance with the findings of a recent experimental work mitchell et al 2021 who observed that sub optimal dosed nitrate treated bioreactors produced sulfide more rapidly than untreated controls although they attributed this observation to the stimulation of sulfide generation in the bioreactors in case of a sub optimal nitrate treatment in some way the current study suggests that a shift in the sulfide generation zone may also be a contributing factor they also presented field data that questions the effectiveness of nitrate treatment moreover the simulation results of mahmoodi and nick 2022 also show a shift in the location of hydrogen sulfide plume inside the reservoir which implies a sub optimal nitrate treatment may result in an earlier increase in the concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the production well 4 environmental implications a sub optimal nitrate treatment strategy to mitigate reservoir souring may have significant negative environmental impacts in various ways first insufficient concentration of nitrate in the injection seawater may increase the amount of hydrogen sulfide produced from the production wells during the lifetime of the project aside from the hazards directly associated with hydrogen sulfide it also leads to increased corrosion in the tubulars higher use of chemicals for h2s scavenging and corrosion inhibition and thus higher consumption of materials rathnayake et al 2019 wang et al 2022 more importantly the addition of excessive amounts of nitrate to injection water results in the presence of unconsumed nitrate and nitrite in the produced water added chemicals and an increased nitrate or nitrite concentration requires costly treatment of the produced water before it is discharged into the sea as they may impact marine and terrestrial ecosystems carrey et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 zou et al 2021 lee et al 2009 5 conclusions the effectiveness of nitrate treatment to prevent souring is studied in a sector model in the danish north sea which shows 1 the effective growth rate of bacteria in a large scale reservoir may be considerably lower than small scale studies which is due to the combined effects of bioavailability and thermal mixing and chemical processes 2 a sub optimal nitrate treatment strategy to mitigate souring may result in higher hydrogen sulfide production from production wells despite a lower total amount of generated hydrogen sulfide inside the reservoir 3 unconsumed nitrate in case of excessive nitrate injection could increase the need for post production water treatment the findings highlight the need for a careful study of each specific reservoir in large scale simulations with the purpose of finding the optimum nitrate concentration considering the coupled effects of thermal mixing chemical and biochemical reactions we show that not only the current understanding of the mechanisms is defective but also our proposed approach has reliable predictive capabilities the presented approach is new and can be used by scientists and engineers for estimating the effective field scale reaction rates which are required for designing operational strategies funding sources the research leading to these results has received funding from the danish

growth rates nitrate is never fully consumed i e some nitrate reach the production well and thus the slow srbs have no time to consume a considerable amount of sulfate fig 1c looking back at the h2s concentrations in the produced gas from the production well fig 1b in case of high and medium effective growth rates a complex behavior is observed before 2018 the nitrate treatment shows a positive effect while after 2018 more h2s is produced from the production well due to an insufficiently effective nitrate treatment compared to the cases with no nitrate treatment this is a consequence of a shift in the h2s generation zone inside the reservoir toward the production well therefore it is possible that a non sufficient amount of nitrate in the injection seawater even increases the concentration of h2s in the produced fluids in such a case the planned cessation of production time is of importance meaning if the plan was to stop production from the well before 2018 the effect of such treatment would be positive otherwise such nitrate treatment causes more h2s produced from production wells this is in accordance with the findings of a recent experimental work mitchell et al 2021 who observed that sub optimal dosed nitrate treated bioreactors produced sulfide more rapidly than untreated controls although they attributed this observation to the stimulation of sulfide generation in the bioreactors in case of a sub optimal nitrate treatment in some way the current study suggests that a shift in the sulfide generation zone may also be a contributing factor they also presented field data that questions the effectiveness of nitrate treatment moreover the simulation results of mahmoodi and nick 2022 also show a shift in the location of hydrogen sulfide plume inside the reservoir which implies a sub optimal nitrate treatment may result in an earlier increase in the concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the production well 4 environmental implications a sub optimal nitrate treatment strategy to mitigate reservoir souring may have significant negative environmental impacts in various ways first insufficient concentration of nitrate in the injection seawater may increase the amount of hydrogen sulfide produced from the production wells during the lifetime of the project aside from the hazards directly associated with hydrogen sulfide it also leads to increased corrosion in the tubulars higher use of chemicals for h2s scavenging and corrosion inhibition and thus higher consumption of materials rathnayake et al 2019 wang et al 2022 more importantly the addition of excessive amounts of nitrate to injection water results in the presence of unconsumed nitrate and nitrite in the produced water added chemicals and an increased nitrate or nitrite concentration requires costly treatment of the produced water before it is discharged into the sea as they may impact marine and terrestrial ecosystems carrey et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 zou et al 2021 lee et al 2009 5 conclusions the effectiveness of nitrate treatment to prevent souring is studied in a sector model in the danish north sea which shows 1 the effective growth rate of bacteria in a large scale reservoir may be considerably lower than small scale studies which is due to the combined effects of bioavailability and thermal mixing and chemical processes 2 a sub optimal nitrate treatment strategy to mitigate souring may result in higher hydrogen sulfide production from production wells despite a lower total amount of generated hydrogen sulfide inside the reservoir 3 unconsumed nitrate in case of excessive nitrate injection could increase the need for post production water treatment the findings highlight the need for a careful study of each specific reservoir in large scale simulations with the purpose of finding the optimum nitrate concentration considering the coupled effects of thermal mixing chemical and biochemical reactions we show that not only the current understanding of the mechanisms is defective but also our proposed approach has reliable predictive capabilities the presented approach is new and can be used by scientists and engineers for estimating the effective field scale reaction rates which are required for designing operational strategies funding sources the research leading to these results has received funding from the danish

24213,northern and southern regions are the two major wheat production belts of china agro climatic resources have changed significantly in recent years threatening staple food production in these regions as a result it is critical to investigate the long term effect of climate change and agri inputs on wheat production in china s top six wheat producing provinces hebei shandong henan jiangsu anhui and hubei from 1995 to 2020 the estimated long run results from the fgls dols and d k estimators revealed that climatic factors specifically temperature had a negative impact on wheat production while precipitation had a positive impact the findings also revealed that agrochemical inputs such as fertilizer increases wheat production whereas pesticide use decreases wheat production significantly the results from the dumitrescu hurlin panel causality test showed a bidirectional causality between rainfall fertilizer use and cultivated area with wheat production while a unidirectional causality association is running from labor force to wheat production the current study provides several critical policy recommendations for china s sustainable food production through green agricultural practices and robust climate mitigation strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords climate change wheat production panel data models china jel codes q54 n55 q10 c33 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction traditional agricultural practices in both developing and underdeveloped economies are gravely threatened by a growing population and unpredictable climate change patterns worldwide agricultural output has been hampered by temperature fluctuations unseasonable precipitation and severe flooding especially in the global south chandio et al 2022a yao et al 2023 sustainable and climate smart agriculture is the way to increase agricultural productivity and meet the needs of the growing population over the long term aragón et al 2021 dunnett et al 2018 the world bank recently has taken the initiative to call for increased agricultural resilience and productivity in the majority of developing and underdeveloped countries by 2030 in particular the world bank acknowledged in its report climate change action plan 2021 25 that economies must adopt the climate smart agriculture system through a robust agricultural financing setup by 2020 approximately 52 percent of agricultural financing has been primarily allocated to climate adaptation and mitigation in the agricultural sector at the global level wb 2021 agriculture production is extremely susceptible to any and all types of internal and external uncertainties in addition to climate change the agricultural output is also affected by war political unrest economic slowdown government instability global slowdown and trade war jagtap et al 2022 as a result of climate change agricultural output has declined in recent years developing and less developed economies account for nearly 80 of global agricultural yields in asia latin america and africa climate change particularly heat waves erratic rainfall and hydrological disasters such as flood cyclone typhoon and hurricane had a significant impact on agricultural outcomes boomiraj et al 2010 kalra et al 2008 pavlova et al 2014 tchebakova et al 2011 another empirical study conducted by baldos et al 2020 estimated the predicted global agricultural losses in terms of monetary values by 2050 due to various natural disasters according to their research agricultural losses from current natural disasters could triple by 2050 on a global scale another interesting study on the relationship between climate change and agricultural output in 28 latin american economies from 1961 to 2015 reveals that climate change has had a negative impact on agri output in the region according to their research an average increase in temperature of 1 6 4 celsius will result in 9 12 agricultural yield losses by 2050 lachaud et al 2022 several other studies in this field confirm based on their respective empirical findings that climate change shock has neutralized the annual agricultural output of all crops bhardwaj et al 2022 gul et al 2022a kumar et al 2021a wheat production remains to be susceptible to climate change and fluctuating precipitation and temperature variations studies confirm from both the stimulated experiment and the conventional process that climate change has increasingly posed a threat to wheat production over the years osman et al 2022 saddique et al 2020 cereal production has already been significantly impacted by climate change using panel data from sub saharan african economies from 1970 to 2016 emediegwu et al 2022 highlighted the importance of climate change on millets yields and discovered that wet days and extreme temperature are the key determinants in impacting maize yields over time chen and gong 2021 studied the effects of extreme temperature on agricultural production in 2495 chinese counties from 1981 to 2015 and discovered that both short term and long term extreme temperature events had a significant negative impact on agricultural yields and productivity in recent years china has seen erratic changes in rainfall patterns and temperature variations in many regions resulting in high economic losses and decimated agricultural output chen et al 2022 sun et al 2016 drought has caused more losses in rice wheat and soya production in the long run and it has been estimated that if the current drought pattern continues there could be a 20 decline in net agri output by 2030 li 2018 one recent study in the case of china by yuan et al 2022 vehemently pointed out the negative returns from agriculture sectors as a result of the region s rise in extreme temperature their research has also revealed that regions particularly in southern china have been hard hit by agricultural production losses caused by extreme temperature events another study conducted by chen et al 2016 looked at the relationship between climate change and agricultural production in 2570 chinese counties from 2000 to 2009 in the long run their research reveals a nonlinear and inverted u shaped relationship between crop yields and weather variables furthermore their research shows that nearly 820 million in economic losses occur in cases of soybean and corn production due to erratic climate change patterns hatfield and dold 2018 identified climate change as the primary emerging stressor threatening wheat production in the great plains states from oklahoma to north dakota from 1950 to 2016 noting that temperature variations between seasons and at the state level do not account for a significant portion of yield variation and that the pattern of increased variation in precipitation will cause further variation in wheat production across the great plains adverse weather conditions such as cold waves have a significant impact on wheat production and crop productivity harkness et al 2020 used a single global climate model to predict crop production rates across the united kingdom taking into account 25 different sites and discovered that adverse weather conditions could potentially destroy crop productivity in the long run fig 1 a and b depict wheat production in tons in all six regions for the years 1995 2000 2010 and 2020 wheat yield declined significantly in the hebei region particularly around the 2000s due to high pesticide attacks and unseasonal rainfall due to such erratic rainfall patterns we also find the same level of fluctuation in wheat production in shandong province despite changes in temperature and rainfall patterns regions such as henan and jiangsu have produced higher wheat yields than the rest of the regions we present mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation for four different years from 1995 to 2020 for the six regions of china hebei shandong henan jiangsu anhui and hubei to see how these meteorological variables fluctuate in the long run see fig 2 in terms of precipitation these states have experienced unusually heavy rainfall in 2020 in addition to precipitation these regions have experienced an annual increase in mean temperature over the years except for hubei most of the cold belt regions have seen an increase in rainfall patterns over the years in terms of temperature variations we noticed that the average minimum temperature throughout the year is also rising significantly in each of these six regions the average minimum temperature has increased by at least two degrees in the last 28 years indicating that climate change is imminent in the region climate variables such as maximum temperature on the other hand have seen about 1 8 2 degree increase across most of the regions from the standpoint of wheat production these erratic temperature changes decimate wheat production in the long run the majority of existing development literature focuses on estimating the global and regional effects of climate change on crop yields affoh et al 2022 agbenyo et al 2022 ahsan et al 2020 akhtar and masud 2022 bhardwaj et al 2022 osman et al 2022 saddique et al 2020 these empirical studies mostly consider climate change from the perspectives of either rainfall or extreme temperature incidents further these studies continue to miss and fail to provide the scope of issues causing crop failures furthermore issues remain unresolved in the development literature particularly at the local level and for important crops such as wheat micro evidences on the effects of climatic variables on agricultural products are still lacking in the empirical development literature we believe that our research will provide new insights into how to think about climate centric adoptions for wheat and other crop cultivations at the micro level our research aims to develop estimates of the potential effects of climatic and conventional agricultural inputs on agricultural yield in this regard we examine the effects of temperature rainfall pattern and other agricultural inputs on wheat production in six chinese provinces by using panel dataset from 1995 to 2020 we believe that because wheat yields have fluctuated more in recent years globally this study attempts to re examine the situation from the perspective of specific wheat growing regions in china the goal of this study is also to provide some holistic approaches to studying wheat production yield in china by combining both climatic and agricultural factor inputs in one place to date most studies have focused solely on climatic factors or agri inputs to examine the effects on final agricultural yield this study is certainly a novel attempt to conduct an exclusive study on the effects of wheat production for developing economies such as china our study examines the effects of mean temperature and precipitation changes on wheat production in china s top six wheat producing regions to fill this research gaps several empirical studies have determined that china s agricultural outputs particularly rice and wheat yields have decreased significantly as a result of a series of intense heatwaves and sporadic flooding in various places huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 luo and yu 2012 ren et al 2021 zhai et al 2017 despite the fact that we are aware of the lack of continuous and regional data on rainfall and mean temperature fluctuations we believe that the present data will be sufficient to provide the first empirical examination of this relationship for the chinese provinces this study can be particularly challenging for such a large geographical economy as china where climatic patterns may differ from region to region taking the aforementioned factors into consideration the following research question is addressed in this study how do temperature and precipitation variations influence wheat production in china s six major wheat producing regions this study also makes five contributions to the existing literature 1 the cross section augmented dickey fuller cadf second generation panel unit root test proposed by pesaran 2007 is used to assess the stationarity of the variables under consideration 2 the modern second generation westerlund 2007 panel cointegration technique is used to investigate the long term relationship between temperature precipitation fertilizer consumption pesticide use cultivated area labour force and wheat production 3 the cross sectional time series fgls method is used to analyses the long term impact of climate change and agricultural inputs on wheat production 4 the robustness of the long run estimate is evaluated using the driscoll kraay dk panel corrected standard error estimator and the fmols estimator 5 using the method developed by dumitrescu and hurlin 2012 the direction of causality is determined between the variable of interest in addition fig 3 depicts the wheat production factors long term factors that influence wheat production are highlighted in fig 3 in addition to the conventional factors we have included two climatic factors temperature and precipitation recent evidence demonstrates that climate change has a significant impact on agricultural yields due to climatic shocks such as heat waves erratic rainfall and arctic blast many developed and developing economies have experienced declines in agricultural yields in terms of examining the agricultural output in our proposed study fig 3 incorporates both conventional and climatic variables rest of our study is organized as follows section 2 gives a glance of past literature in this current dimension section 3 represents the data and methodology of the study section 4 analyses the empirical results and the consequent discussion of the analysis finally section 5 concludes the analysis with policy suggestions 2 literature review agriculture has incurred a few hidden costs as a result of erratic changes in climatic patterns over the last two decades agriculture in both developed and developing economies has suffered massive losses as a result of a sudden increase in global average temperature and erratic rainfall patterns resulting in a decrease in investment intensity in agri sectors over time and an increase in reliance on importing economies resulting in a deceleration of forex reserves previous research has shown that erratic climate change patterns impede agriculture development in developing and underdeveloped countries maia et al 2018 investigated the relationship between climate change pattern and agricultural production in brazil taking into account environmental preservation and ecosystem services their research examines the relationship between changes in meteorological variables and agricultural production in 568 brazilian municipalities between 1990 and 2014 and their findings indicate that the dynamics of extreme climate events inhibit agricultural growth however these escalating negative effects can be mitigated by implementing improved technologies and ecosystem restoration processes datta and behera 2022 analysed the adoption of agriculture strategies amidst changes in weather pattern for indian farmers by analysing a wide range of earlier literature from a variety of credible sources and highlighting that the majority of agri adoption techniques are found to be systemic and incremental with the majority of adoption strategies stemming from the yearly changes in meteorological conditions generally erratic climatic patterns manifest themselves in three dimensions high temperatures heavy erratic precipitation and the erratic presence of cold waves all of which have the potential to destroy agricultural yields over time a vast body of literature has examined the negative effects of erratic climatic patterns on global agricultural yields evidence suggests that erratic and unseasonable precipitation has negative effects not only on agricultural production but also on economic growth when viewed from the perspective of precipitation barrios et al 2010 examined the impacts of lesser rainfall on the african economies and found the direct negative impacts of the decimated precipitation upon economic growth kotz et al 2022 analysed the effects of annual rainfall on economic production in 1554 regions across the globe over the past four decades and discovered that the increase in the frequency of rainy days has significantly slowed gdp growth several empirical studies have confirmed that both excess and deficient rainfalls have negative effects on economies over the years brown and lall 2006 davis 2016 gilmont et al 2018 sangkhaphan and shu 2019 in the 1990s levine and yang 2014 studied the relationship between rainfall and rice production at the district level in indonesia according to their findings a 10 increase in annual rainfall results in a 0 4 increase in annual rice production talib et al 2021 analysed the long term effects of temperature changes and rainfall on agricultural production for 32 african economies they found that an increase in temperature has significantly negative effects on agricultural output whereas an increase in rainfall has no statistically significant effect on agricultural output menon 2009 highlights the importance of the rainfall uncertainty with the occupational choice of agricultural households in the rural nepal and their results show that every 1 increase in the coefficient of variation in rainfall leads to a decline of 0 61 in the occupational choice of agriculture over the years abay et al 2022 explain the impacts of visible rainfall variability on the agriculture credit in case of ethiopia and their results show that rise in the rainfall variability leads to the greater discouragement of subscribing more agricultural credits development literature in the domain of climate change has not limited its approach w r t erratic rainfall even researchers have suggested to look into the impacts of extreme temperature and cold wave on the agricultural yield aragón et al 2021 undertaken one household study peru considering the impacts of high temperature on agricultural and livestock outputs findings show that high temperature leads to a change in the responses of agri strategy periodically however overall agri output has gone down drastically ogunkanmi et al 2021 studied the association between soybean production and high temperature ranges and demonstrated that high temperature with persistent drought leads to the decline in soybean production warsame et al 2022 assessed the impacts of extreme temperature on the livelihoods in somalia over the years 1985 2016 and find that high temperature compared to rainfall exerts negative impacts on the livestock production marmai et al 2022 explored the association between extreme weather events in terms of high temperature for low and upper developing economies from 1961 to 2002 upon six major crops like maize wheat rice barley sorghum and soybeans and find that although there exists heterogeneity in the impacts still extreme temperature leads to the dampening of the agri production over the years researches as of date have not exclusively focused on the climate change and wheat production nexus there are few scant literatures available in this domain especially in few wheat rich economies globally ludwig et al 2009 examined the association between climate change systems and wheat production in case of the western australian province considering a large scale time data from 1945 to 2004 their study shows that with the rise in dryland salinity declined rainfall and persistent high temperature in winter months have led to the subsequent decline in wheat yields in the region due to the rise in average minimum temperature in the pampas region of argentina magrin et al 2009 noticed a decline in wheat production owing to the climate change pattern in the region while considering a large scale data from 1930 to 2000 janjua et al 2014 study the impacts of global climate change pattern on wheat production in case of pakistan considering annual data from 1960 to 2009 and find that high temperature negatively impacts the wheat growth and productivity as well some other literature specify that climate change has severely impacted the wheat production globally govere et al 2022 karatayev et al 2022 pequeno et al 2021 rehman and sohag 2021 considering the literature in this regard we noticed that it remains a least researched area as of date there needs a greater orientation for looking and examining this dimension from the standpoints of climate change perspective in the table 1 we have also incorporated few studies in relation to china and some developing economies 3 data and methodology 3 1 data data on the production of wheat wp annual mean temperature tp annual mean precipitation

jiangsu anhui and hubei table 2 lists the measurement units for the variables and the data sources the trend of the underlying variables is shown in fig 4 3 2 model specification the primary objective of this study is to examine the effect of climatic factors and input factors on wheat yield in china s top six wheat producing provinces the basic model is expressed as follows 1 w p f t p p r f c p c c a l f where wp represents the dependent variable wheat production and tp pr fc pc ca and lf represent the independent variables annual mean temperature annual mean precipitation fertilizer consumption pesticide usage cultivated area and labor force in this study furthermore we have expressed specification 1 in linear logarithm form as shown below the eq 1 is expressed in linear

dependence test cross sectional dependence cd is typically ignored by longitudinal data estimation procedures which can lead to unreliable results ambiguous information and biased estimates ahmad et al 2021 eregha et al 2022 in addition ignoring the presence of cd can render meaningless the unit root and co integration outputs akam et al 2022 nathaniel et al 2022 the cd depicts correlation among all cross sectional units in a panel as a result of unobservable common factors common to all the units baltagi and hashem pesaran 2007 however some of the factors of such correlation include globalization economic integration socioeconomic network geographical location and spatial spillover chudik et al 2016 huang et al 2022 jahanger et al 2022 hence we have the obligation to investigate whether cd happens or not among the cross sections three specific cd tests are carried out in this study they include the pesaran cd test introduced by pesaran 2004 pesaran scaled lagrange multiplier lm test also introduced by pesaran 2004 and the breusch pagan lm proposed by breusch and pagan 1980 these three methods are efficient in detecting cd de hoyos and sarafidis 2006 under the null hypothesis of cd and alternative of otherwise the cd test of pesaran 2004 is estimated using the equation below 3 c d 2 t n n 1 i 0 n 1 j i 1 n 1 ρ i j n 0 1 where the cross sections correlation of error between i and j is given as ρ i j this test is compatible for panels where the time period t is greater than the number of cross sections n that is t n this is the exact nature of our panel 3 3 2 unit root test amidst the presence of cd the subsequent procedure will be to investigate all concerned variables integration stationary level for this purpose we utilized the cross section im pesaran and shin cips and cross section augmented dickey fuller cadf second generation panel unit root tests suggested by pesaran 2007 cips and cadf are consistent robust and capable of producing reliable results ahmad et al 2022 ali et al 2022 nathaniel and iheonu 2019 the two tests account for cd issues and predict a statistic expressed as 4 δ y i t ϑ i t β i x i t 1 ρ i t j 1 n θ i j ψ i t j ε i t where represents the first difference operator while ϑ is the intercept ψ is the key variable of interest the presence of unit root in ψ will warrant the need to take the difference of the variable ψ i t ψ i t 1 both tests address the issues of heterogeneity and cd in both short and long panels pesaran 2007 3 3 3 co integration test after staionarity tests the next step is to examine long term association between all the selected variables in this regard the pedroni 2004 kao 1999 and westerlund 2007 co integration tests are utilized pedroni 2004 and westerlund 2007 test assume cd but the later deals with cd using robust critical values derived via bootstrapping nathaniel and iheonu 2019 the westerlund 2007 test suggests four statistics including g τ g α group and p α p τ panel alongside four equations given as 5 p α t α and p τ α i s e α i 6 g α 1 n i 1 n t α i α i 1 and g τ 1 n i 1 n α i s e α i eq 5 estimates the existence of co integration in at least one of the cross sectional units while eq 6 investigate the presence of co integration in the whole panel 3 3 4 parameter estimation if the westerlund 2007 test confirmed co integration then the next step would be to examine the long run impact of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable for this purpose we choose to use the feasible generalized least squares fgls to examine long run impact the fgls is efficient in overcoming serial correlation time invariant cd and group wise heteroscedasticity and heterogeneity rahman et al 2022 fgls also yield robust standard errors awan et al 2020 furthermore the fgls technique overcome endogeneity addresses the issue of reverse causality and report robust empirics shahzad et al 2021a some of the studies that have used this technique in the past include afonso et al 2021 sadiq and wen 2022 shahzad et al 2021b usman and radulescu 2022 yameogo et al 2022 zakari and khan 2021 besides fmols proposed by pedroni 2001 and the driscoll kraay dk panel corrected standard errors approach are used to check for robustness of the findings the dk technique is a non parametric approach that is flexible enough to accommodate balanced and unbalanced panel and large time dimension in addition the dk approach accounts for heteroscedasticity autocorrelation and cd nathaniel et al 2021 sarkodie and strezov 2019 we show the dk equation in eq 7 as 7 y i t x i t β ε i t i 1 n t 1 t y i t and x i t represent the dependent and independent variable respectively i t and n stand for the cross sectional units time period and number of samples respectively on the other hand the fmols equation is given as 8 w h e a t p r o d u c t i o n μ i g i t ψ v i t 9 g i t g i t ω i t where g is a vector of independent variables whereas μ i is the constant while c i t and v i t are the error terms besides ψ is estimated as 10 ψ f m o l s i 1 n t 1 t x i t x i t x i t x i t 1 i 1 n t 1 t x i t x i t w p i t t δ v c where w p i t is the estimate of the dependent variable whereas δ v c is the first difference term 3 3 5 causality test the fgls fmols and dk techniques do not provide any evidence of causality for this reason we used the dumitrescu and hurlin dh 2012 test to derive information on the possible direction s of causality among the various variables considered in our study the dh is an advanced econometric procedure that is consistent with serial correlation heterogeneity and cd ahmad et al 2022 usman and radulescu 2022 the dh equation is given as 11 y i t ζ i i 1 p ξ i p y i t n i 1 p π i p x i t n μ i t the intercept and coefficient ζ i and π i π i 1 π i p are fixed ξ i p a n d π i p are the autoregressive parameter and regression coefficient respectively the methodological framework of the study is shown in fig 5 4 results and discussions table 3 provides a descriptive outline of the variables logwp logtp logpr logfc logpc logca and loglf table 3 also includes the correlation estimates climate factors temperature and precipitation are found to be significantly and negatively correlated with wheat production whereas agro chemical inputs fertilizer and pesticide and other determinants cultivated area and labour force are found to be significantly and positively associated with wheat production in china s selected wheat producing provinces table 4 shows the estimated results of the cross sectional dependence tests namely the breusch pagan lm the pesaran scaled lm and the pesaran cd at the 1 level of statistical significance the null hypothesis for cross sectional independence is rejected the findings indicate that all variable series are interdependent the results of the panel unit root test are shown in table 5 we used a second generation suitable panel unit root test pesaran 2007 in this study to address the csd issue the results of the cadf test confirm that all variables with the exception of logfc fertilizer consumption are integrated at their first level i 1 indicating that all variables namely logwp wheat production logtp temperature logpr precipitation logpc pesticide logca cultivated area and loglf labour force are stationary after taking their difference table 6 displays the co integration results obtained with the pedroni kao and westerlund 2007 ecm tests at various significance levels the results confirm the presence of a co integration connection between the dependent variable logwp and the independent variables logtp logpr logfc logpc logca and loglf following the confirmation of a long term co integration relationship among the studied variables this study employs the cross sectional time series fgls approach to estimate the underlying variables long run elasticity table 7 shows the results of the fgls method the long run coefficient of climate variable temperature is statistically significant and negative implying that a 1 c change in temperature reduces wheat production by 0 518 this finding implies that temperature is detrimental to wheat production in certain chinese wheat producing provinces although precipitation has a positive significant impact on wheat production as a result temperature variation is a crucial climate related factor that in the case of china has a significant impact on cereal production and should be carefully considered when developing effective climate change policies this finding is in line with those reported by zhai et al 2017 for henan province china bhardwaj et al 2022 for india gul et al 2022a for pakistan and affoh et al 2022 for sub saharan africa according to asseng et al 2011 who reported that average surge in temperature has declined wheat yields due to increase in temperature at the grain filling stage in contrast amir and sinclair 1991 revealed that high radiation and lower temperature are favourable for grain wheat production whereas in february and march increasing temperature negatively influenced wheat yields the long run coefficient of climate variable precipitation is statistically significant and positive indicating that a one millimeter increase in precipitation improves wheat production by 0 054 previous studies have empirically tested the relationship between precipitation and cereal production affoh et al 2022 gul et al 2022a pickson et al 2022 who reported that precipitation positively contributes to cereal production on the other hand yang et al 2013 reported that shrinkage in precipitation in the vegetative stage and a surge in the reproductive stage decrease wheat yields similarly emenekwe et al 2022 bedasa bedemo 2022 and pickson et al 2022 who revealed that precipitation negatively influenced food security the long run coefficient of agro chemical input fertilizer usage is statistically significant and positive such that a 1 increase in chemical fertilizer usage corresponds to a 0 110 increase in wheat yield agro chemical inputs such as fertilizer use have been an integral part of modern agricultural production as they provide the majority of plant nutrients necessary to sustain modern crop yields and soil fertility tilman et al 2002 abbas 2022 empirically tested the relationship between fertilizer use and food crop yields and revealed that fertilizer use significantly improved food crop yields gul et al 2022b also found a positive link between fertilizer use and staple food crops yield our finding is also in line with those reported by ozdemir 2021 kumar et al 2021a and zhang et al 2022 for the long run surprisingly the long run coefficient of agro chemical input pesticide usage is statistically significant and negative and a 1 increase in pesticide usage corresponds to a 0 052 decrease in wheat production this relationship may be attributable to the excessive use of pesticides in recent years the excessive use of agrochemical inputs pesticide usage has not only resulted in a decline in crop yields but has also caused numerous environmental issues such as water pollution soil acidification and threats to human health zhang et al 2022 moving on to the other input variables the results indicate that a 1 increase in cultivated area and labor force increases wheat production by 1 132 and 0 255 respectively in the long run as planting area increases increase wheat production to meet domestic food demand and ensure national food security our findings are in line with the long run outcomes of abbas 2022 akhtar masud 2022 emenekwe et al 2022 and gul et al 2022b the fmols and driscoll kraay standard errors estimation techniques are used in this study to further validate the robustness of the fgls model fmols and d k results were found to be consistent with the fgls technique table 8 displays the fmols and d k results according to the findings yearly average temperature and pesticide use have a negative and significant impact on wheat production in the long run yearly average precipitation fertilizer consumption cultivated area and labour have a positive impact on wheat production our findings of fmols and d k are parallel with the results of abbas mayo 2021 kumar et al 2021b bhardwaj et al 2022 and affoh et al 2022 fig 6 shows several quantile quantile scs stack cross section diagrams that show the intervals for each chosen quantile against each other for all underlying variables after examining the long term effects of climate change and agrochemical inputs on wheat output the current study used the dumitrescu hurlin causality test to investigate the causal relationships between the underlying series the outcomes are detailed in table 9 it is observed bidirectional causality between rainfall fertilizer use and cultivated area with wheat production while a unidirectional causality association is running from labour force to wheat production these findings are in line with the previous conclusion of pickson et al 2021 for china gul et al 2022a for pakistan and zhang et al 2022 for china this means that there is a strong validation of the feedback hypothesis between these variables with the output of wheat the favourable pattern of precipitation proper use of fertilizer and expansion of planting area greatly increase wheat yield and satisfy the nation s domestic food requirement 5 conclusion and policy implications over the past few decades china s climate has changed and will continue to change despite any effective mitigation efforts agricultural production is highly vulnerable to climate change and is a climate dependent activity worldwide understanding current climate variability and its interaction with agricultural production is critical for china s long term development as a result we investigate the long run effect of climate change and agrochemical inputs on wheat production in china s top six wheat producing provinces from 1995 to 2020 for empirical data analysis this study used the most recent econometric techniques such as the cadf second generation panel unit root test pedroni kao and westerlund ecm second generation panel co integration test fgls dols d k and h d methods the results of the csd tests show a strong cross sectional dependence among the series panel co integration tests confirmed the co integration of the variables studied the long term results of the fgls show that in the top six wheat producing regions of china temperature has a significantly negative impact on wheat output while precipitation has a significantly favourable impact the empirical results of this study further indicate that agro chemical inputs such as fertilizer use has a significantly positive effect on wheat production while usage of pesticide has a significantly negative impact in addition the findings of the study indicate that wheat output in the top six wheat producing regions in china is greatly enhanced by the cultivation area and labour force we examined our panel dataset using the dols and d k estimation methods to confirm the model s robustness and the results were consistent with those of the fgls method we also examined the causality directions among the selected variables of the study by employing the d h panel causality method the results indicate bidirectional causality between rainfall fertilizer use and cultivated area with wheat production while we detected a one way causality association is running from labour force to wheat production based on the empirical findings this study proposes several policy implications for improving wheat production and dealing with climate change in china s wheat producing provinces considering the temporal effects of changes in meteorological patterns the regions must initiate the strategy to figure out producing more climate adopting crops along with the major crops our findings from this analysis reinstates that regions need to look for adopting and switching to the new crop regimes which can be considered as more sustainable agriculture pattern as well as economically more viable regions in china needs more local think tank in terms of developing and innovating more climate centric adoption policies in agriculture in the highly vulnerable zones more international research collaborations need to be developed across these wheat producing zones of china in terms of devising and following higher international standards looking into the future patterns of climate change mimicking from the present context the local institutions in these regions must educate the farmers regarding greater technological adoption in agri practices tech usages in predicting changes in meteorological conditions and other associated activities to safeguard them potentially from the future repercussions considering such a large scale heterogeneity in a large geographic like china a uniform policy proposal needs to be framed to deal with production of highly vulnerable major crops in near future credit authorship contribution statement abbas ali chandio conceptualization data

24213,northern and southern regions are the two major wheat production belts of china agro climatic resources have changed significantly in recent years threatening staple food production in these regions as a result it is critical to investigate the long term effect of climate change and agri inputs on wheat production in china s top six wheat producing provinces hebei shandong henan jiangsu anhui and hubei from 1995 to 2020 the estimated long run results from the fgls dols and d k estimators revealed that climatic factors specifically temperature had a negative impact on wheat production while precipitation had a positive impact the findings also revealed that agrochemical inputs such as fertilizer increases wheat production whereas pesticide use decreases wheat production significantly the results from the dumitrescu hurlin panel causality test showed a bidirectional causality between rainfall fertilizer use and cultivated area with wheat production while a unidirectional causality association is running from labor force to wheat production the current study provides several critical policy recommendations for china s sustainable food production through green agricultural practices and robust climate mitigation strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords climate change wheat production panel data models china jel codes q54 n55 q10 c33 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction traditional agricultural practices in both developing and underdeveloped economies are gravely threatened by a growing population and unpredictable climate change patterns worldwide agricultural output has been hampered by temperature fluctuations unseasonable precipitation and severe flooding especially in the global south chandio et al 2022a yao et al 2023 sustainable and climate smart agriculture is the way to increase agricultural productivity and meet the needs of the growing population over the long term aragón et al 2021 dunnett et al 2018 the world bank recently has taken the initiative to call for increased agricultural resilience and productivity in the majority of developing and underdeveloped countries by 2030 in particular the world bank acknowledged in its report climate change action plan 2021 25 that economies must adopt the climate smart agriculture system through a robust agricultural financing setup by 2020 approximately 52 percent of agricultural financing has been primarily allocated to climate adaptation and mitigation in the agricultural sector at the global level wb 2021 agriculture production is extremely susceptible to any and all types of internal and external uncertainties in addition to climate change the agricultural output is also affected by war political unrest economic slowdown government instability global slowdown and trade war jagtap et al 2022 as a result of climate change agricultural output has declined in recent years developing and less developed economies account for nearly 80 of global agricultural yields in asia latin america and africa climate change particularly heat waves erratic rainfall and hydrological disasters such as flood cyclone typhoon and hurricane had a significant impact on agricultural outcomes boomiraj et al 2010 kalra et al 2008 pavlova et al 2014 tchebakova et al 2011 another empirical study conducted by baldos et al 2020 estimated the predicted global agricultural losses in terms of monetary values by 2050 due to various natural disasters according to their research agricultural losses from current natural disasters could triple by 2050 on a global scale another interesting study on the relationship between climate change and agricultural output in 28 latin american economies from 1961 to 2015 reveals that climate change has had a negative impact on agri output in the region according to their research an average increase in temperature of 1 6 4 celsius will result in 9 12 agricultural yield losses by 2050 lachaud et al 2022 several other studies in this field confirm based on their respective empirical findings that climate change shock has neutralized the annual agricultural output of all crops bhardwaj et al 2022 gul et al 2022a kumar et al 2021a wheat production remains to be susceptible to climate change and fluctuating precipitation and temperature variations studies confirm from both the stimulated experiment and the conventional process that climate change has increasingly posed a threat to wheat production over the years osman et al 2022 saddique et al 2020 cereal production has already been significantly impacted by climate change using panel data from sub saharan african economies from 1970 to 2016 emediegwu et al 2022 highlighted the importance of climate change on millets yields and discovered that wet days and extreme temperature are the key determinants in impacting maize yields over time chen and gong 2021 studied the effects of extreme temperature on agricultural production in 2495 chinese counties from 1981 to 2015 and discovered that both short term and long term extreme temperature events had a significant negative impact on agricultural yields and productivity in recent years china has seen erratic changes in rainfall patterns and temperature variations in many regions resulting in high economic losses and decimated agricultural output chen et al 2022 sun et al 2016 drought has caused more losses in rice wheat and soya production in the long run and it has been estimated that if the current drought pattern continues there could be a 20 decline in net agri output by 2030 li 2018 one recent study in the case of china by yuan et al 2022 vehemently pointed out the negative returns from agriculture sectors as a result of the region s rise in extreme temperature their research has also revealed that regions particularly in southern china have been hard hit by agricultural production losses caused by extreme temperature events another study conducted by chen et al 2016 looked at the relationship between climate change and agricultural production in 2570 chinese counties from 2000 to 2009 in the long run their research reveals a nonlinear and inverted u shaped relationship between crop yields and weather variables furthermore their research shows that nearly 820 million in economic losses occur in cases of soybean and corn production due to erratic climate change patterns hatfield and dold 2018 identified climate change as the primary emerging stressor threatening wheat production in the great plains states from oklahoma to north dakota from 1950 to 2016 noting that temperature variations between seasons and at the state level do not account for a significant portion of yield variation and that the pattern of increased variation in precipitation will cause further variation in wheat production across the great plains adverse weather conditions such as cold waves have a significant impact on wheat production and crop productivity harkness et al 2020 used a single global climate model to predict crop production rates across the united kingdom taking into account 25 different sites and discovered that adverse weather conditions could potentially destroy crop productivity in the long run fig 1 a and b depict wheat production in tons in all six regions for the years 1995 2000 2010 and 2020 wheat yield declined significantly in the hebei region particularly around the 2000s due to high pesticide attacks and unseasonal rainfall due to such erratic rainfall patterns we also find the same level of fluctuation in wheat production in shandong province despite changes in temperature and rainfall patterns regions such as henan and jiangsu have produced higher wheat yields than the rest of the regions we present mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation for four different years from 1995 to 2020 for the six regions of china hebei shandong henan jiangsu anhui and hubei to see how these meteorological variables fluctuate in the long run see fig 2 in terms of precipitation these states have experienced unusually heavy rainfall in 2020 in addition to precipitation these regions have experienced an annual increase in mean temperature over the years except for hubei most of the cold belt regions have seen an increase in rainfall patterns over the years in terms of temperature variations we noticed that the average minimum temperature throughout the year is also rising significantly in each of these six regions the average minimum temperature has increased by at least two degrees in the last 28 years indicating that climate change is imminent in the region climate variables such as maximum temperature on the other hand have seen about 1 8 2 degree increase across most of the regions from the standpoint of wheat production these erratic temperature changes decimate wheat production in the long run the majority of existing development literature focuses on estimating the global and regional effects of climate change on crop yields affoh et al 2022 agbenyo et al 2022 ahsan et al 2020 akhtar and masud 2022 bhardwaj et al 2022 osman et al 2022 saddique et al 2020 these empirical studies mostly consider climate change from the perspectives of either rainfall or extreme temperature incidents further these studies continue to miss and fail to provide the scope of issues causing crop failures furthermore issues remain unresolved in the development literature particularly at the local level and for important crops such as wheat micro evidences on the effects of climatic variables on agricultural products are still lacking in the empirical development literature we believe that our research will provide new insights into how to think about climate centric adoptions for wheat and other crop cultivations at the micro level our research aims to develop estimates of the potential effects of climatic and conventional agricultural inputs on agricultural yield in this regard we examine the effects of temperature rainfall pattern and other agricultural inputs on wheat production in six chinese provinces by using panel dataset from 1995 to 2020 we believe that because wheat yields have fluctuated more in recent years globally this study attempts to re examine the situation from the perspective of specific wheat growing regions in china the goal of this study is also to provide some holistic approaches to studying wheat production yield in china by combining both climatic and agricultural factor inputs in one place to date most studies have focused solely on climatic factors or agri inputs to examine the effects on final agricultural yield this study is certainly a novel attempt to conduct an exclusive study on the effects of wheat production for developing economies such as china our study examines the effects of mean temperature and precipitation changes on wheat production in china s top six wheat producing regions to fill this research gaps several empirical studies have determined that china s agricultural outputs particularly rice and wheat yields have decreased significantly as a result of a series of intense heatwaves and sporadic flooding in various places huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 luo and yu 2012 ren et al 2021 zhai et al 2017 despite the fact that we are aware of the lack of continuous and regional data on rainfall and mean temperature fluctuations we believe that the present data will be sufficient to provide the first empirical examination of this relationship for the chinese provinces this study can be particularly challenging for such a large geographical economy as china where climatic patterns may differ from region to region taking the aforementioned factors into consideration the following research question is addressed in this study how do temperature and precipitation variations influence wheat production in china s six major wheat producing regions this study also makes five contributions to the existing literature 1 the cross section augmented dickey fuller cadf second generation panel unit root test proposed by pesaran 2007 is used to assess the stationarity of the variables under consideration 2 the modern second generation westerlund 2007 panel cointegration technique is used to investigate the long term relationship between temperature precipitation fertilizer consumption pesticide use cultivated area labour force and wheat production 3 the cross sectional time series fgls method is used to analyses the long term impact of climate change and agricultural inputs on wheat production 4 the robustness of the long run estimate is evaluated using the driscoll kraay dk panel corrected standard error estimator and the fmols estimator 5 using the method developed by dumitrescu and hurlin 2012 the direction of causality is determined between the variable of interest in addition fig 3 depicts the wheat production factors long term factors that influence wheat production are highlighted in fig 3 in addition to the conventional factors we have included two climatic factors temperature and precipitation recent evidence demonstrates that climate change has a significant impact on agricultural yields due to climatic shocks such as heat waves erratic rainfall and arctic blast many developed and developing economies have experienced declines in agricultural yields in terms of examining the agricultural output in our proposed study fig 3 incorporates both conventional and climatic variables rest of our study is organized as follows section 2 gives a glance of past literature in this current dimension section 3 represents the data and methodology of the study section 4 analyses the empirical results and the consequent discussion of the analysis finally section 5 concludes the analysis with policy suggestions 2 literature review agriculture has incurred a few hidden costs as a result of erratic changes in climatic patterns over the last two decades agriculture in both developed and developing economies has suffered massive losses as a result of a sudden increase in global average temperature and erratic rainfall patterns resulting in a decrease in investment intensity in agri sectors over time and an increase in reliance on importing economies resulting in a deceleration of forex reserves previous research has shown that erratic climate change patterns impede agriculture development in developing and underdeveloped countries maia et al 2018 investigated the relationship between climate change pattern and agricultural production in brazil taking into account environmental preservation and ecosystem services their research examines the relationship between changes in meteorological variables and agricultural production in 568 brazilian municipalities between 1990 and 2014 and their findings indicate that the dynamics of extreme climate events inhibit agricultural growth however these escalating negative effects can be mitigated by implementing improved technologies and ecosystem restoration processes datta and behera 2022 analysed the adoption of agriculture strategies amidst changes in weather pattern for indian farmers by analysing a wide range of earlier literature from a variety of credible sources and highlighting that the majority of agri adoption techniques are found to be systemic and incremental with the majority of adoption strategies stemming from the yearly changes in meteorological conditions generally erratic climatic patterns manifest themselves in three dimensions high temperatures heavy erratic precipitation and the erratic presence of cold waves all of which have the potential to destroy agricultural yields over time a vast body of literature has examined the negative effects of erratic climatic patterns on global agricultural yields evidence suggests that erratic and unseasonable precipitation has negative effects not only on agricultural production but also on economic growth when viewed from the perspective of precipitation barrios et al 2010 examined the impacts of lesser rainfall on the african economies and found the direct negative impacts of the decimated precipitation upon economic growth kotz et al 2022 analysed the effects of annual rainfall on economic production in 1554 regions across the globe over the past four decades and discovered that the increase in the frequency of rainy days has significantly slowed gdp growth several empirical studies have confirmed that both excess and deficient rainfalls have negative effects on economies over the years brown and lall 2006 davis 2016 gilmont et al 2018 sangkhaphan and shu 2019 in the 1990s levine and yang 2014 studied the relationship between rainfall and rice production at the district level in indonesia according to their findings a 10 increase in annual rainfall results in a 0 4 increase in annual rice production talib et al 2021 analysed the long term effects of temperature changes and rainfall on agricultural production for 32 african economies they found that an increase in temperature has significantly negative effects on agricultural output whereas an increase in rainfall has no statistically significant effect on agricultural output menon 2009 highlights the importance of the rainfall uncertainty with the occupational choice of agricultural households in the rural nepal and their results show that every 1 increase in the coefficient of variation in rainfall leads to a decline of 0 61 in the occupational choice of agriculture over the years abay et al 2022 explain the impacts of visible rainfall variability on the agriculture credit in case of ethiopia and their results show that rise in the rainfall variability leads to the greater discouragement of subscribing more agricultural credits development literature in the domain of climate change has not limited its approach w r t erratic rainfall even researchers have suggested to look into the impacts of extreme temperature and cold wave on the agricultural yield aragón et al 2021 undertaken one household study peru considering the impacts of high temperature on agricultural and livestock outputs findings show that high temperature leads to a change in the responses of agri strategy periodically however overall agri output has gone down drastically ogunkanmi et al 2021 studied the association between soybean production and high temperature ranges and demonstrated that high temperature with persistent drought leads to the decline in soybean production warsame et al 2022 assessed the impacts of extreme temperature on the livelihoods in somalia over the years 1985 2016 and find that high temperature compared to rainfall exerts negative impacts on the livestock production marmai et al 2022 explored the association between extreme weather events in terms of high temperature for low and upper developing economies from 1961 to 2002 upon six major crops like maize wheat rice barley sorghum and soybeans and find that although there exists heterogeneity in the impacts still extreme temperature leads to the dampening of the agri production over the years researches as of date have not exclusively focused on the climate change and wheat production nexus there are few scant literatures available in this domain especially in few wheat rich economies globally ludwig et al 2009 examined the association between climate change systems and wheat production in case of the western australian province considering a large scale time data from 1945 to 2004 their study shows that with the rise in dryland salinity declined rainfall and persistent high temperature in winter months have led to the subsequent decline in wheat yields in the region due to the rise in average minimum temperature in the pampas region of argentina magrin et al 2009 noticed a decline in wheat production owing to the climate change pattern in the region while considering a large scale data from 1930 to 2000 janjua et al 2014 study the impacts of global climate change pattern on wheat production in case of pakistan considering annual data from 1960 to 2009 and find that high temperature negatively impacts the wheat growth and productivity as well some other literature specify that climate change has severely impacted the wheat production globally govere et al 2022 karatayev et al 2022 pequeno et al 2021 rehman and sohag 2021 considering the literature in this regard we noticed that it remains a least researched area as of date there needs a greater orientation for looking and examining this dimension from the standpoints of climate change perspective in the table 1 we have also incorporated few studies in relation to china and some developing economies 3 data and methodology 3 1 data data on the production of wheat wp annual mean temperature tp annual mean precipitation pr consumption of fertilizer fc use of pesticides pc cultivated area ca and labour force lf were gathered for six major wheat producing provinces in china between 1995 and 2020 hebei shandong henan jiangsu anhui and hubei table 2 lists the measurement units for the variables and the data sources the trend of the underlying variables is shown in fig 4 3 2 model specification the primary objective of this study is to examine the effect of climatic factors and input factors on wheat yield in china s top six wheat producing provinces the basic model is expressed as follows 1 w p f t p p r f c p c c a l f where wp represents the dependent variable wheat production and tp pr fc pc ca and lf represent the independent variables annual mean temperature annual mean precipitation fertilizer consumption pesticide usage cultivated area and labor force in this study furthermore we have expressed specification 1 in linear logarithm form as shown below the eq 1 is expressed in linear logarithm form 2 l o g w p i t α i t δ 1 l o g t p i t δ 2 l o g p r i t δ 3 l o g f c i t δ 4 l o g p c i t δ 5 l o g c a i t δ 6 l o g l f i t ε i t 3 3 evaluation methods 3 3 1 cross sectional dependence test cross sectional dependence cd is typically ignored by longitudinal data estimation procedures which can lead to unreliable results ambiguous information and biased estimates ahmad et al 2021 eregha et al 2022 in addition ignoring the presence of cd can render meaningless the unit root and co integration outputs akam et al 2022 nathaniel et al 2022 the cd depicts correlation among all cross sectional units in a panel as a result of unobservable common factors common to all the units baltagi and hashem pesaran 2007 however some of the factors of such correlation include globalization economic integration socioeconomic network geographical location and spatial spillover chudik et al 2016 huang et al 2022 jahanger et al 2022 hence we have the obligation to investigate whether cd happens or not among the cross sections three specific cd tests are carried out in this study they include the pesaran cd test introduced by pesaran 2004 pesaran scaled lagrange multiplier lm test also introduced by pesaran 2004 and the breusch pagan lm proposed by breusch and pagan 1980 these three methods are efficient in detecting cd de hoyos and sarafidis 2006 under the null hypothesis of cd and alternative of otherwise the cd test of pesaran 2004 is estimated using the equation below 3 c d 2 t n n 1 i 0 n 1 j i 1 n 1 ρ i j n 0 1 where the cross sections correlation of error between i and j is given as ρ i j this test is compatible for panels where the time period t is greater than the number of cross sections n that is t n this is the exact nature of our panel 3 3 2 unit root test amidst the presence of cd the subsequent procedure will be to investigate all concerned variables integration stationary level for this purpose we utilized the cross section im pesaran and shin cips and cross section augmented dickey fuller cadf second generation panel unit root tests suggested by pesaran 2007 cips and cadf are consistent robust and capable of producing reliable results ahmad et al 2022 ali et al 2022 nathaniel and iheonu 2019 the two tests account for cd issues and predict a statistic expressed as 4 δ y i t ϑ i t β i x i t 1 ρ i t j 1 n θ i j ψ i t j ε i t where represents the first difference operator while ϑ is the intercept ψ is the key variable of interest the presence of unit root in ψ will warrant the need to take the difference of the variable ψ i t ψ i t 1 both tests address the issues of heterogeneity and cd in both short and long panels pesaran 2007 3 3 3 co integration test after staionarity tests the next step is to examine long term association between all the selected variables in this regard the pedroni 2004 kao 1999 and westerlund 2007 co integration tests are utilized pedroni 2004 and westerlund 2007 test assume cd but the later deals with cd using robust critical values derived via bootstrapping nathaniel and iheonu 2019 the westerlund 2007 test suggests four statistics including g τ g α group and p α p τ panel alongside four equations given as 5 p α t α and p τ α i s e α i 6 g α 1 n i 1 n t α i α i 1 and g τ 1 n i 1 n α i s e α i eq 5 estimates the existence of co integration in at least one of the cross sectional units while eq 6 investigate the presence of co integration in the whole panel 3 3 4 parameter estimation if the westerlund 2007 test confirmed co integration then the next step would be to examine the long run impact of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable for this purpose we choose to use the feasible generalized least squares fgls to examine long run impact the fgls is efficient in overcoming serial correlation time invariant cd and group wise heteroscedasticity and heterogeneity rahman et al 2022 fgls also yield robust standard errors awan et al 2020 furthermore the fgls technique overcome endogeneity addresses the issue of reverse causality and report robust empirics shahzad et al 2021a some of the studies that have used this technique in the past include afonso et al 2021 sadiq and wen 2022 shahzad et al 2021b usman and radulescu 2022 yameogo et al 2022 zakari and khan 2021 besides fmols proposed by pedroni 2001 and the driscoll kraay dk panel corrected standard errors approach are used to check for robustness of the findings the dk technique is a non parametric approach that is flexible enough to accommodate balanced and unbalanced panel and large time dimension in addition the dk approach accounts for heteroscedasticity autocorrelation and cd nathaniel et al 2021 sarkodie and strezov 2019 we show the dk equation in eq 7 as 7 y i t x i t β ε i t i 1 n t 1 t y i t and x i t represent the dependent and independent variable respectively i t and n stand for the cross sectional units time period and number of samples respectively on the other hand the fmols equation is given as 8 w h e a t p r o d u c t i o n μ i g i t ψ v i t 9 g i t g i t ω i t where g is a vector of independent variables whereas μ i is the constant while c i t and v i t are the error terms besides ψ is estimated as 10 ψ f m o l s i 1 n t 1 t x i t x i t x i t x i t 1 i 1 n t 1 t x i t x i t w p i t t δ v c where w p i t is the estimate of the dependent variable whereas δ v c is the first difference term 3 3 5 causality test the fgls fmols and dk techniques do not provide any evidence of causality for this reason we used the dumitrescu and hurlin dh 2012 test to derive information on the possible direction s of causality among the various variables considered in our study the dh is an advanced econometric procedure that is consistent with serial correlation heterogeneity and cd ahmad et al 2022 usman and radulescu 2022 the dh equation is given as 11 y i t ζ i i 1 p ξ i p y i t n i 1 p π i p x i t n μ i t the intercept and coefficient ζ i and π i π i 1 π i p are fixed ξ i p a n d π i p are the autoregressive parameter and regression coefficient respectively the methodological framework of the study is shown in fig 5 4 results and discussions table 3 provides a descriptive outline of the variables logwp logtp logpr logfc logpc logca and loglf table 3 also includes the correlation estimates climate factors temperature and precipitation are found to be significantly and negatively correlated with wheat production whereas agro chemical inputs fertilizer and pesticide and other determinants cultivated area and labour force are found to be significantly and positively associated with wheat production in china s selected wheat producing provinces table 4 shows the estimated results of the cross sectional dependence tests namely the breusch pagan lm the pesaran scaled lm and the pesaran cd at the 1 level of statistical significance the null hypothesis for cross sectional independence is rejected the findings indicate that all variable series are interdependent the results of the panel unit root test are shown in table 5 we used a second generation suitable panel unit root test pesaran 2007 in this study to address the csd issue the results of the cadf test confirm that all variables with the exception of logfc fertilizer consumption are integrated at their first level i 1 indicating that all variables namely logwp wheat production logtp temperature logpr precipitation logpc pesticide logca cultivated area and loglf labour force are stationary after taking their difference table 6 displays the co integration results obtained with the pedroni kao and westerlund 2007 ecm tests at various significance levels the results confirm the presence of a co integration connection between the dependent variable logwp and the independent variables logtp logpr logfc logpc logca and loglf following the confirmation of a long term co integration relationship among the studied variables this study employs the cross sectional time series fgls approach to estimate the underlying variables long run elasticity table 7 shows the results of the fgls method the long run coefficient of climate variable temperature is statistically significant and negative implying that a 1 c change in temperature reduces wheat production by 0 518 this finding implies that temperature is detrimental to wheat production in certain chinese wheat producing provinces although precipitation has a positive significant impact on wheat production as a result temperature variation is a crucial climate related factor that in the case of china has a significant impact on cereal production and should be carefully considered when developing effective climate change policies this finding is in line with those reported by zhai et al 2017 for henan province china bhardwaj et al 2022 for india gul et al 2022a for pakistan and affoh et al 2022 for sub saharan africa according to asseng et al 2011 who reported that average surge in temperature has declined wheat yields due to increase in temperature at the grain filling stage in contrast amir and sinclair 1991 revealed that high radiation and lower temperature are favourable for grain wheat production whereas in february and march increasing temperature negatively influenced wheat yields the long run coefficient of climate variable precipitation is statistically significant and positive indicating that a one millimeter increase in precipitation improves wheat production by 0 054 previous studies have empirically tested the relationship between precipitation and cereal production affoh et al 2022 gul et al 2022a pickson et al 2022 who reported that precipitation positively contributes to cereal production on the other hand yang et al 2013 reported that shrinkage in precipitation in the vegetative stage and a surge in the reproductive stage decrease wheat yields similarly emenekwe et al 2022 bedasa bedemo 2022 and pickson et al 2022 who revealed that precipitation negatively influenced food security the long run coefficient of agro chemical input fertilizer usage is statistically significant and positive such that a 1 increase in chemical fertilizer usage corresponds to a 0 110 increase in wheat yield agro chemical inputs such as fertilizer use have been an integral part of modern agricultural production as they provide the majority of plant nutrients necessary to sustain modern crop yields and soil fertility tilman et al 2002 abbas 2022 empirically tested the relationship between fertilizer use and food crop yields and revealed that fertilizer use significantly improved food crop yields gul et al 2022b also found a positive link between fertilizer use and staple food crops yield our finding is also in line with those reported by ozdemir 2021 kumar et al 2021a and zhang et al 2022 for the long run surprisingly the long run coefficient of agro chemical input pesticide usage is statistically significant and negative and a 1 increase in pesticide usage corresponds to a 0 052 decrease in wheat production this relationship may be attributable to the excessive use of pesticides in recent years the excessive use of agrochemical inputs pesticide usage has not only resulted in a decline in crop yields but has also caused numerous environmental issues such as water pollution soil acidification and threats to human health zhang et al 2022 moving on to the other input variables the results indicate that a 1 increase in cultivated area and labor force increases wheat production by 1 132 and 0 255 respectively in the long run as planting area increases increase wheat production to meet domestic food demand and ensure national food security our findings are in line with the long run outcomes of abbas 2022 akhtar masud 2022 emenekwe et al 2022 and gul et al 2022b the fmols and driscoll kraay standard errors estimation techniques are used in this study to further validate the robustness of the fgls model fmols and d k results were found to be consistent with the fgls technique table 8 displays the fmols and d k results according to the findings yearly average temperature and pesticide use have a negative and significant impact on wheat production in the long run yearly average precipitation fertilizer consumption cultivated area and labour have a positive impact on wheat production our findings of fmols and d k are parallel with the results of abbas mayo 2021 kumar et al 2021b bhardwaj et al 2022 and affoh et al 2022 fig 6 shows several quantile quantile scs stack cross section diagrams that show the intervals for each chosen quantile against each other for all underlying variables after examining the long term effects of climate change and agrochemical inputs on wheat output the current study used the dumitrescu hurlin causality test to investigate the causal relationships between the underlying series the outcomes are detailed in table 9 it is observed bidirectional causality between rainfall fertilizer use and cultivated area with wheat production while a unidirectional causality association is running from labour force to wheat production these findings are in line with the previous conclusion of pickson et al 2021 for china gul et al 2022a for pakistan and zhang et al 2022 for china this means that there is a strong validation of the feedback hypothesis between these variables with the output of wheat the favourable pattern of precipitation proper use of fertilizer and expansion of planting area greatly increase wheat yield and satisfy the nation s domestic food requirement 5 conclusion and policy implications over the past few decades china s climate has changed and will continue to change despite any effective mitigation efforts agricultural production is highly vulnerable to climate change and is a climate dependent activity worldwide understanding current climate variability and its interaction with agricultural production is critical for china s long term development as a result we investigate the long run effect of climate change and agrochemical inputs on wheat production in china s top six wheat producing provinces from 1995 to 2020 for empirical data analysis this study used the most recent econometric techniques such as the cadf second generation panel unit root test pedroni kao and westerlund ecm second generation panel co integration test fgls dols d k and h d methods the results of the csd tests show a strong cross sectional dependence among the series panel co integration tests confirmed the co integration of the variables studied the long term results of the fgls show that in the top six wheat producing regions of china temperature has a significantly negative impact on wheat output while precipitation has a significantly favourable impact the empirical results of this study further indicate that agro chemical inputs such as fertilizer use has a significantly positive effect on wheat production while usage of pesticide has a significantly negative impact in addition the findings of the study indicate that wheat output in the top six wheat producing regions in china is greatly enhanced by the cultivation area and labour force we examined our panel dataset using the dols and d k estimation methods to confirm the model s robustness and the results were consistent with those of the fgls method we also examined the causality directions among the selected variables of the study by employing the d h panel causality method the results indicate bidirectional causality between rainfall fertilizer use and cultivated area with wheat production while we detected a one way causality association is running from labour force to wheat production based on the empirical findings this study proposes several policy implications for improving wheat production and dealing with climate change in china s wheat producing provinces considering the temporal effects of changes in meteorological patterns the regions must initiate the strategy to figure out producing more climate adopting crops along with the major crops our findings from this analysis reinstates that regions need to look for adopting and switching to the new crop regimes which can be considered as more sustainable agriculture pattern as well as economically more viable regions in china needs more local think tank in terms of developing and innovating more climate centric adoption policies in agriculture in the highly vulnerable zones more international research collaborations need to be developed across these wheat producing zones of china in terms of devising and following higher international standards looking into the future patterns of climate change mimicking from the present context the local institutions in these regions must educate the farmers regarding greater technological adoption in agri practices tech usages in predicting changes in meteorological conditions and other associated activities to safeguard them potentially from the future repercussions considering such a large scale heterogeneity in a large geographic like china a uniform policy proposal needs to be framed to deal with production of highly vulnerable major crops in near future credit authorship contribution statement abbas ali chandio conceptualization data

24214,we determined the decomposition topology and properties of the woody crown network wcn in tree species growing under semiarid and rainy climates in caatinga and cerrado vegetations nodes in wcn were branching regions and connectors were the woody axes networking nodes or emerging from them decomposition and topology combinations output new wcn properties laterality sharing basitony and potential topological plasticity all new properties were higher in caatinga than cerrado especially in large wcn bearing more than 600 nodes evergreen trees of cerrado and caatinga shortened the distance from initial to final nodes by high basitony facilitating water access to the final nodes and their annexed organs the superior number of nodes found in cerrado s evergreen trees and the caatinga trees intensified the hydraulic segmentation and vulnerability segmentation edifying suitable wcn for working under more intense water stress laterality basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity uncovered the space filling disparity strategies between deciduous and evergreen trees in the same sensu stricto cerrado area the reduced maximum wcn height with increasing water shortage from tall to shrubby caatinga physiognomies appears associated with high basitony and laterality the same possibly happens across cerrado s physiognomies from tall cerradão to grassland campo limpo with developing water nutritional and fire pruning stresses the wcn model showed how the crown architecture blueprint could be modulated by eight entangle properties according to the intensity of multiple ambient pressures keywords basitony caatinga cerrado hydraulic architecture laterality topological plasticity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the woody axes have the conduits responsible for the xylem and phloem sap distribution connecting the annexed aerial organs with the underground compartment the branching regions of axes are the nodes and the connections between them or merely emerging from them are the connectors of a woody crown network wcn souza et al 2011 prado et al 2020 the resistance to moving the water through the xylem over a path crossing the wcn arises with node and connector accumulations due to the further interactions between fluid and the conductor and the potential gain in altitude of the water column peres 2015 hauser 1996 the node region is a site for reducing the leaf specific hydraulic conductivity measured as the water flow per time per pressure gradient divided by transpiring leaf area in each woody axis ewers and zimmerman 1984 short length small diameter and low density of conduits drop the hydraulic conductivity in the xylem at branch junctions zimmerman 1978 tyree and ewers 1991 anfodillo et al 2013 kotowska 2015 the non functional spiral xylem at the branching region slanting axis and larger parent diameter than the emerging woody branch favor the water flow in parental woody segments lev yagun and aloni 1990 eisner et al 2002 the leaf specific conductivity is higher in the stem than in branches and higher in first order than in succeeding second order branches after branching zimmermann 1983 tyree et al 1983 ewers and zimmermann 1984 tyree and sperry 1988 cruiziat et al 2002 the stratification of woody axes in wcn by strahler order accounted for approximately 70 of the total variation in leaf specific conductivity in a 7 m tall tree fraxinus americana joyce and steiner 1995 hence the node region results in hydraulic segmentation of wcn sensu zimmermann 1983 outcoming leaf specific conductivity lower in distal woody axes than in proximal ones due to significant branch region resistances the hydraulic segmentation principle gave rise to hydraulic vulnerability segmentation proposing that distal crown portions are more vulnerable to cavitation than costly basal ones tyree and ewers 1991 tyree and zimmermann 2002 hydraulic and vulnerability segmentations participate in the plant hydraulic architecture protecting thicker proximal aerial woody portions responsible for storing and conducting water toward distal woody regions and their corresponding annexed organs charrier et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 rodriguez dominguez et al 2018 despite the branching system monopodial or sympodial or privileged position on parental axes a given node s hydraulic failure or detachment will interrupt the xylem supply to all nodes and connectors distal it therefore nodes attachment arrangement by connectors topology is pivotal to determining how many nodes will no longer receive the xylem sap after a node hydraulic failure or detachment in a wcn the combination of decomposition and topology gave rise to the four properties of wcn prado et al 2020 those properties uncovered the distribution of nodes in the woody axes population symmetry and how much it is conserved with size complexity the properties also captured how many nodes and connectors are necessary to cross the wcn from the initial to final nodes navigability and how many nodes will disengage after each detachment from the total nodes vulnerability if the lateral instead of rectilinear node addition is frequent building new final nodes and branching orders the vulnerability drops and navigability increases steeply with wcn size prado et al 2020 therefore the wcn hydraulic architecture is intrinsically associated with its decomposition in nodes and connectors with its woody axes topological arrangement and its properties resulted combining decomposition and topology joyce and steiner 1995 tyree and zimmermann 2002 souza et al 2011 prado et al 2020 here we study tree species with a wide variation in the total number of nodes and topology of woody axes in the wcn of trees growing in the semiarid area of caatinga and in a rainy area of cerrado vegetation in brazil despite the high resistance to xylem sap flow at the node region the caatinga s woody species edify notable segmented wcn by branching araújo et al 2007 moro et al 2016 queiroz et al 2017 caatinga is south america s largest tropical dry forest silva et al 2017 occurring in flattened depressions 300 500 m a s l in northeastern brazil it is submitted to a rainfall regime between 240 900 mm per year with 7 11 months free of rain and average air temperature between 25 30 c prado 2003 sampaio 1995 santos et al 2011 water availability is the most important abiotic factor in selecting morphological and physiological traits in the plant body and the principal driver defining biogeographical subregions in caatinga araújo et al 2007 silva and souza 2018 the caatinga area s climate is semiarid because the precipitation potential evapotranspiration rate is 0 65 sampaio 2010 the hampered growth limiting the longitudinal air space acquisition of caatinga woody species occurs due to long periods under severe water stress vasconcelos sobrinho 1970 andrade lima 1981 1982 lemos and rodal 2002 silva et al 2017 how can decomposition and topology mitigate the inherent increase in hydraulic resistance during the wcn growth by intense branching and consequent node addition in caatinga trees we tried to answer by combining decomposition and topology outputting new properties based on the former wcn model prado et al 2020 and applying it to crowns with a wide variation in the number of nodes under caatinga s natural conditions furthermore it was a chance to review some data and experiment with the new properties in already skeletonized 15 species distributed in deciduous semideciduous and evergreen cerrado trees souza et al 2011 prado et al 2020 we investigated if novel properties could capture other significant differences in wcn separating those leaf phenological groups of trees in cerrado moreover former and new combinations of decomposition and topology could reveal how the wcn acquires lateral and longitudinal air space achieving different maximum heights with water availability in caatinga and under multiple stresses across the cerrado physiognomies cerrado is the second most extensive vegetation domain in latin america initially covering about 2 106 km2 of the brazilian territory klink and machado 2005 deep and well drained soil highly weathered and deficient in nutrient availability yamada 2005 lepsch 2016 besides frequent fire arruda et al al 2018 are significant drives tailoring the cerrado vegetation physiognomies the cerrado domain s rainfall ranges from 800 to 1800 mm with only 10 occurring in the dry season between may and september with the annual mean air temperature ranging from 20 to 26 c bustamante et al 2012 the cerrado core in brazil s central area shows 2 3 months without rainfall franco et al 1996 franco 2002 a maximum of 2 months free of rain occurs in the southeast area of the cerrado s domain mattos et al 1997 prado et al 2004 showing a precipitation evapotranspiration rate of about 0 9 marcuzzo et al 2008 the adult woody community in cerrado can keep favorable water status in plant bodies across the year prado et al 2004 by shedding leaves and accessing by roots the permanent available water in the soil at layers more profound than 0 85 m franco 2002 oliveira et al al 2005 despite the relatively easy accessibility of water in most soils of cerrado the woody species modulate the foliage area seasonally camargo et al 2018 deciduous semideciduous and evergreen cerrado trees are significantly different in geometric decomposition and topological wcn features souza et al 2009b souza et al 2011 prado et al 2020 the interdependency of wcn features resulted in distinctive strategies for acquiring storing and using resources and easy identification of functional groups is the leaf persistence in cerrado s trees prado et al 2020 borges et al 2018 our approach could shed light on whole crown hydraulic architecture understanding the strategies of woody crown development under stresses jonhson et al 2016 therefore we aimed to know the critical control points of the entire crown hydraulic architecture modulated by decomposition topology and properties due to the drop in conductivity detected at the branching region we hypothesized that the total number of nodes is an essential decomposition component in wcn and hydraulic architecture those former and new properties may capture crucial advanced features about the whole wcn hydraulics and their relationship with maximum crown height under intense and moderate water shortages in caatinga and cerrado vegetations 2 materials and methods 2 1 area climate and the study species of caatinga and cerrado vegetations we conducted the study in a fragment of caatinga vegetation at the fazenda pocinho 7 29 46 s and 35 58 12 w in barra de santana municipality state of paraíba brazil the area is in the microregion called cariri oriental borborema mesoregion aesa 2018 according to the köppen classification köppen 1948 the study area is bswh a hot semiarid type with a dry season reaching a period of nine to ten months and an average annual rainfall 600 mm with rains distributed irregularly across the

white forest andrade lima 1982 ibge 2012 we selected 11 tree species in caatinga growing in sunny areas without wcn damage or overlapped by surrounding woody species in the field ten of those 11 species totalized 4191 woody branching regions nodes covering broad wcn sizes from 36 to 806 nodes table 1 in an endemic caatinga deciduous tree species cenostigma pyramidale tul gagnon g p lewis we selected 14 individuals totalizing 3968 nodes distributed in three wcn sizes table 2 the cynophalla flexuosa l presl and those three individuals of c pyramidale showing small wcn tables 1 and 2 with stem diameter near the soil surface 3 0 cm or height 100 cm could be considered juvenile rodal et al 2013 the drawings with captions and the data of decomposition topology and properties captured by the wcn model from each skeletonized caatinga species are available in the zenodo public repository at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6578043 for those ten species and in https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6578235 for 14 individuals of c pyramidale also we utilized the skeletonized wcn obtained by souza et al 2011 in 75 crowns of tree species of cerrado vegetation distributed in 15 species five individuals per species totalizing 5354 nodes the drawings and data of decomposition topology and those eight properties obtained by our model of each skeletonized cerrado wcn are available in the zenodo repository https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6575067 those trees grew under natural conditions in a most common physiognomy stricto sensu of cerrado vegetation in a reservoir of 86 ha located at 850 m above sea level in são carlos city são paulo state brazil at 21 58 22 00 s and 47 51 47 52 w following the köppen climatic classification this region is between aw and cwa a tropical climate with dry winter and wet summer the rainy season occurs between october march and the dry season between april and september prado et al 2004 monteiro and prado 2006 the historical 1939 2007 average values standard deviation of annual precipitation and air temperature were 1420 168 mm and 22 0 4 c souza et al 2009a 2 2 representing the wcn in a bi dimensional space the wcn representation in a bi dimensional space by drawing followed the methodology described by prado et al 2020 the branching regions were the nodes no and the woody crown segments connecting the nodes or merely emerging from them were the connectors co the resulting tree graph with its subgraphs is an oriented network with a single pathway between two nodes rosen 2019 without an alternative pathway forming network loops or triangles the wcn is free of shortcuts making impossible node clustering watts and strogatz 1998 barabási and oltvai 2004 prado et al 2020 the highly connected nodes with more than four connectors as emission nodes are rare in wcn outputting an exponential decay of the probability of a node having a k connector pk as a function of the number of k connectors on nodes prado et al 2020 we adopted three wcn size categories for the tree species c pyramidale individuals up to 100 nodes comprised the small category trees having between 101 600 and 601 900 nodes covered the middle and large wcn classes table 2 we captured the no and co distribution in wcn by drawing the woody axes from the root collar following the recommendations highlighted in prado et al 2020 the initial node in was the first node from the collar region towards the apical meristem the wcn branching began in the in the regular node rn showed three co and the emission node en supported four or more co the last nodes near the apical meristem were the final nodes fn in each wcn the woody axes are those segments composed of successive nodes presenting at least one unshared node between axes the final node performing a unique space signature in a wcn the number of woody axes in a wcn equals the summation of final nodes fn 2 3 decomposition topology and properties utilized in the woody crown network model we obtained the decomposition topology and properties in the woody crown network model following prado et al 2020 the decomposition values in each wcn were the total number of nodes no representing the size of wcn the total of connectors co and the total number of regular rn final fn and emission nodes en we capture the topology in each wcn determining the distances in connectors between the initial and final nodes in fn and between initial and emission nodes in en we introduced one more component in a woody axis about wcn decomposition the switched node which receives at least one lateral connection section 2 4 1 therefore it was possible to introduce the total of switch nodes sn in decomposition and the distance between the initial node to the switch node in the topology navigability property considers the size no and the average amount of co needed to cross a wcn indicated by the distances in fn the total number of distances equals the fn fig 1 the no divided by the average of the distances in fn outputs the navigability of a wcn prado et al 2020 the navigability captures the wcn s ability to acquire air space by node addition minimizing the inherent increase of hydraulic resistance to reach the final nodes i navigability no in fn fn where no any node counted once regardless of its category in initial node fn final node in fn distance in connectors between the initial and final nodes the vulnerability was the average of lost nodes after each regular and emission node detachment excluding final and initial nodes detachment divided by the size of a wcn the number of regular and emission nodes considered to obtain vulnerability equals the total of nodes minus the final nodes plus one no fn 1 vulnerability output is the average number of unengaged nodes including the detached node from the water column after a node hydraulic failure in wcn the disconnected node must be counted as a lost node in each node attack the detached node was not counted as a lost node by prado et al 2020 it resulted in an underestimated average value of vulnerability between 18 21 in deciduous semideciduous and evergreen cerrado tree species all corrected values of vulnerability for cerrado trees are presented here in the results table 7 ii vulnerability i 1 n lni no fn 1 no where lni total of lost nodes including the attacked node after detachment of the node i as regular or emission node no any node counted once regardless of its type fn final nodes we captured the asymmetry of a wcn by measuring on each axis how far the amount of co in in fn distances is about the average in fn distance divided by the number of in fn paths equal to fn the result is the population variance of in fn representing the variability of all distances to cross the wcn prado et al 2020 population instead of sample variance must be used since it is calculated from population data not sample data the sample variation was misapplied by prado et al 2020 in deciduous semideciduous and evergreen cerrado tree species underestimating the average values between 11 15 in each leaf phenological group all corrected values of symmetry about cerrado tree species are presented here in table 7 iii asymmetry in f n 1 avg 2 in f n 2 avg 2 in f n n avg 2 σ fn where in initial node fn final node in fn distance in connectors between initial and final nodes avg average of the distances counted in connectors between the in fn nodes the inverse of asymmetry was the symmetry of wcn prado et al 2020 by considering the node as a particular site for reducing the hydraulic conductivity symmetry equation iv performs how homogeneous the hydraulic paths are between the highest topological units the woody axes in the wcn the complexity property captures the homogeneity of hydraulics considering all woody axes dividing the size per symmetry equation v it reflects the hydraulic s homogeneity contemplating the whole wcn therefore symmetry and complexity outline the distribution uniformity of the other six properties in the wcn iv symmetry 1 asymmetry v complexity no symmetry where no any node counted once regardless of its type 2 4 the new constituents of decomposition topology and properties in the woody crown network model 2 4 1 lateral node addition the switch node and its distance about the initial node it is possible to find one or more lateral node addition from the initial to the final node in every woody axis in each wcn the lateral connection creates a superior axis order attached to a parental axis one more final node and a further distance between the initial and the new final node fig 1 those lateral connections occur along the axes on the switch nodes sn the first sn from final to initial node separates the axis into shared and unshared node portions fig 1 the number of axes equals the final nodes in each wcn fig 1 the first wcn axis cannot be lateral but can receive a lateral node addition therefore the number of lateral connections in a wcn equals the number of axes fn minus one in fig 1 the initial node receives two lateral connections one node can be an emission node bearing more than two raised connectors prado et al 2020 enabling the sn to be also an emission node in fig 1 the initial node is an emission node and an sn therefore the initial node can show one or more lateral node additions resulting in zero connectors about the distance between itself and the nearest sn figs 1 and 2 counting the distance in many connectors from the initial node to sn is possible denoting how proximal the lateral insertions are about the initial node fig 2 the number of lateral axes per node outputs the laterality property which value decreases by rectilinear node addition fig 3 the lateral insertions proximity to the initial node impacts navigability vulnerability complexity symmetry and the maximum crown height figs 3 and 4 2 4 2 laterality and the sites of lateral attachments the number of lateral insertions equals the total number of final nodes minus one since the first parental axis cannot be lateral laterality lat captures how many lateral insertions are per node by dividing the total number of lateral additions by the total number of nodes in each wcn vi laterality fn 1 no where fn final nodes no any node counted once regardless of its type the number of lateral insertions is essential in featuring the wcn topology modulating the properties by creating new axes final nodes and higher axis orders alternatively the rectilinear node insertion increases the number of nodes in an axis impacting the symmetry between axes the lateral insertions improve navigability by shortening the average distance to cross the wcn and decreasing vulnerability by creating a new order axis prado et al 2020 besides lateral as an alternative to rectilinear node insertion promotes the adjacent instead of longitudinal air space acquisition figs 3 and 4 the impact of laterality on the other wcn properties depends on the lateral attachments distance from the initial node a new lateral axis developing near the initial node raises navigability and complexity it decreases vulnerability and symmetry as illustrated in fig 3 from a to b and from d to e wcn rectilinear node addition on a new developing axis near the initial node equalizes the number of nodes between new and old axes increasing symmetry and decreasing complexity as depicted in fig 3 from b to c and from c to d wcn by node addition privileging positions near the initial node the height will increase only after a rectilinear node insertion at the top of the highest axis like in fig 3 d wcn reaching 9 8 units alternatively lateral new attachment far from the initial node at the apex of parental axes has a low impact on navigability and vulnerability from a to e wcn fig 4 maximum height and complexity in fig 4 raised steeper from c to d wcn symmetry decreased abruptly after some rectilinear node insertions far from the initial node in fig 4 d wcn there were 11 instead of 3 nodes shared between axes in e wcn comparing figs 4 and 3 furthermore the maximum wcn height in fig 4 increased from 8 3 to 10 6 units due to the nodes connection near the apex of a parental axis far from the initial node in both types of wcn figs 3 and 4 laterality increased by lateral and decreased by rectilinear node insertion hence lateral insertions at the bottom of the parental axis on the proximal portion near the initial node increase navigability and decrease vulnerability this basitonic topology also promotes high symmetry and low complexity values after rectilinear node addition by equalizing the number of nodes between axes fig 3 however connections at proximal portions of the parental axis near the initial node restrict the maximum height due to the impact of lateral axis attachments on properties and height it is essential to measure how far the switch nodes are from the initial node determining the basitony property in each wcn 2 4 3 basitony basitony indicates the preferential development of lateral axes at the base of a vertical stem or shoot troll 1937 barhélémy and caraglio 2007 here basitony designates the proximity of lateral axes insertions to the initial node if lateral insertion is near the parental axis s apex it is more distal to the initial node alternatively if lateral insertion is at the base of a parental axis it is more proximal to the initial node therefore counting the number of connectors from the initial node to each switch node at the lateral insertion is necessary to capture basitony the number of total nodes in wcn divided by the average distance from the initial to switch nodes outputs the basitony property vii basitony no in sn 1 in snn n where no any node counted once regardless of its type in initial node sn switch node the basitony values about e wcn with the same number of nodes axes and the distribution of nodes between axes were 30 0 and 5 4 in figs 3 and 4 higher basitony resulted in higher navigability lower vulnerability and reduced crown height at the end of attachments in e wcn in fig 3 about fig 4 otherwise the low basitony in fig 4 minimally impacted navigability and vulnerability after some node additions from a to e wcn in each axis the number of nodes the total of lateral attachments and their insertion sites near the base or apex regulate the number of shared nodes depicted by the green circles in e wcn figs 3 and 4 a parental axis can emit sibling axes more proximal or distal to the initial node sharing some nodes along its path according to the site of lateral axis attachment fig 2 sharing nodes between axes can decrease the total number of nodes to construct a wcn with the same number of axes and the average distance between the initial and the final nodes indicating the efficiency of air space acquisition by node addition fig 5 2 4 4 sharing two wcn with the same number of woody axes and the average distance from initial to final nodes may differ in size no due to the distinct topology by changing the number of nodes shared between axes node sharing lessens the total nodes increasing air space acquisition efficiency by saving nodes fig 5 also in a wcn having more than one axis the initial node is always shared by all axes figs 1 7 for calculating the sharing property sha it is necessary to obtain the average of nodes per axis by counting those nodes directly or counting the number of connectors in each axis in a wcn the number of nodes in a woody axis equals the number of connectors from the initial to the final node adding one the average number of nodes per axis multiplied by the number of axes fn results in a proxy of total nodes in that wcn without shared nodes between axes apart from the initial node this result minus the actual number of nodes outputs how many nodes the wcn did not build and kept the same number of axes and the average distance from initial to final nodes due to the physical sharing of nodes between axes orders this last outcome divided by the total number of nodes represents the sharing value of a wcn viii sharing in fn 1 in fnn fn 1 fn no no where in initial node fn final node no any node counted once regardless of its type in fn distance counted in connectors between the initial and final nodes lower basitony results in higher sharing and height between wcn with the same number of nodes axes and distribution of nodes like e wcn on figs 3 and 4 unquestionably lateral node addition promotes sharing sha and the number of axis orders figs 1 5 increasing the diversity of sites for node appearance in each wcn for example a new node may appear after or before a switch node in a parental axis supporting a lateral node connection furthermore a new node may appear on a parental or sibling axis therefore lateral node addition increases the possibilities of attachments raising the potential topological plasticity in a wcn 2 4 5 potential topological plasticity it is possible to ask at least three questions about a new node s topological position in a given wcn 1 on which woody axis will the new node appear the number of possibilities depends on how many axes a wcn has the number of axes equals the total number of final nodes in a wcn 2 will the new node attach laterally or rectilinearly in a given axis therefore lateral and rectilinear positions of attachments duplicate the possibility of inserting a node in each axis 3 the new node attachment will happen after or before a switch node considering a woody axis path from the initial node navigability and basitony will increase major if the node addition occurs near the initial node in a more shared portion of nodes alternatively the increment in navigability and basitony will be lesser if the new node appears somewhat farther from the initial node in an axis s less shared or unshared node portion figs 3 and 4 irrespective of the number of axes connected to a switch node the number of positions before or after a switch node for adding a new node equals the total of the switch nodes plus one fig 6 considering those three questions above we can capture the potential topological plasticity ptp computing how many possibilities exist to add a new node equation ix the number 2 multiplying the total number of woody axes fn in equation ix is about those two possibilities to insert a node laterally or rectilinearly in each axis irrespective of the total number of nodes the first switch node added in a wcn creates two more opportunities for new node insertion a and b wcn fig 6 the subsequent switch node additions make only one extra possibility of inserting a new node about the positions after and before the switch nodes from b to c wcn fig 6 ix potential topological plasticity 2 fn sn 1 where fn final node sn switch node from equation ix it is possible to note that lateral node addition increments ptp due to the increase of final and switch nodes any rectilinear node addition on woody axes does not alter the components in equation ix high ptp facilitates the homogeneous distribution of properties in wcn due to more possibilities of sites of connections changing the topology by node addition moreover wcn with the same number of nodes differing in potential topological plasticity by lateral connections may have higher navigability symmetry and sharing values along with lower complexity vulnerability and height fig 7 2 5 statistical analysis we organized the datasets and obtained the average standard deviation values of decomposition topology and properties in studied wcn of caatinga and cerrado vegetations by microsoft excel software 2019 mso version 2207 we used the shapiro wilk test in the paleontological statistics software package for education and data analysis past version 3 26 hammer et al 2001 to verify the normal distribution of each dataset by past package we applied anova tukey kramer or kruskal wallis dunn according to the normality output of datasets to validate significative differences p 0 05 between averages the multivariate principal component analysis with past was performed in a correlation matrix using the eight properties obtained in 75 and 24 wcn in cerrado and caatinga trees we utilized those eight properties and the r software r core team 2020 to apply multivariate nonparametric analysis of variance by bray curti s distance comparing pairs of leaf phenological groups of cerrado trees distributed in deciduous de semideciduous sd and evergreen ev 3 results 3 1 caatinga woody crown networks in c pyramidale the total nodes and crown height differed across the wcn sizes and stem diameter near the soil surface was higher in large wcn table 2 the basic construction unit of those wcn was the node with three connectors 94 of the nodes resulting in different average values of regular nodes across the wcn categories and a comparable ratio 2 0 of total connectors per total of nodes table 3 despite most nodes with three connectors we found a significant increase in final and switch nodes between small middle and large wcn the highest distances from the initial to final node switch and emission nodes occurred in large c pyramidale wcn table 3 average values of navigability and potential topological plasticity increased significantly across wcn sizes table 4 alternatively vulnerability decreased from small to large wcn symmetry average values were equal between wcn categories the intense node addition near the initial node increased basitony from small to large classes making the c pyramidale more navigable and complex with more positions to add a new node elevated topological plasticity and less vulnerable without impacting symmetry in extended wcn still the sharing raised in middle and large wcn depicted the increasing efficiency of woody axes built by node insertions table 4 the ranges of the total number of nodes 36 825 connectors 77 1748 and the ratio between the total of nodes and total of connectors around 2 0 were similar in c pyramidale and ten caatinga tree species tables 3 and 5 the regular nodes in ten caatinga tree species were between 83 and 99 with an average of 91 as we found in c pyramidale there were increasing distances between the initial and the other types of nodes with wcn size in those ten caatinga tree species table 5 along with increasing complexity basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity toward extended crows table 6 furthermore vulnerability decreased with wcn size from c flexuosa to m rigida table 6 hence decomposition topology and properties trends with node addition were similar between those 14 wcn of c pyramidale and the other ten wcn in caatinga tree species 3 2 cerrado woody crown networks the average values of total nodes and complexity differed across cerrado s deciduous semideciduous and evergreen trees table 7 evergreen species also showed higher average values than deciduous trees in several properties navigability basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity on the other hand evergreen species had lower values of symmetry and vulnerability than deciduous trees laterality did not diverge over the cerrado leaf phenological groups table 7 deciduous trees appeared separated from evergreen cerrado species in a multivariate nonparametric analysis of variance using the eight properties together or separated into two groups table 8 semidecidous species showed intermediate property values with symmetry equal to deciduous species but navigability vulnerability basitony and sharing average values were similar to evergreen trees table 7 3 3 principal component analyses pca of woody crown network properties in caatinga and cerrado the pattern was similar to the vector distribution representing the variation of the eight properties in caatinga and cerrado in a pca s bi dimensional space figs 8 and 9 regardless of the vegetation the variations in vulnerability were in opposition to navigability basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity furthermore negative variations of vulnerability and symmetry and positive variations of most properties laterality sharing navigability potential topological plasticity basitony and complexity were associated with extended wcn settled on the pca s right side in both vegetations figs 8 and 9 on the left side of caatinga s pca fig 8 it is possible to find the wcn from 36 c pyramidale and c flexuosa to 358 p stipulaceae nodes we found the wcn between 400 z

variation in cerrado with deciduous and evergreen species preferentially occupying the left and the right pca s sides semideciduous trees appeared scattered between deciduous and evergreen species fig 9 in the same group of leaf phenological group the extended wcn carrying a more significant number of nodes occurred at the right side about individuals showing fewer nodes fig 9 3 4 caatinga vs cerrado woody crown network as a function of node addition we found similar patterns in decomposition and properties by node addition in caatinga and cerrado with a switch node increasing vulnerability and symmetry decreasing and most of the properties rising tables 3 7 on the other hand the range of values and the relationship of properties as a function of total nodes wcn size differed between caatinga and cerrado figs 10 13 in caatinga the navigability ranged from 4 3 in c flexuosa table 6 to 64 2 in large wcn of c pyramidale table 4 increasing exponentially and steeper after wcn with 600 nodes fig 10 otherwise the cerrado navigability values ranged from 1 6 in a tomentosum to 24 9 in e gracilipes table 7 increasing almost linearly and reaching a plateau near 17 5 after 150 nodes fig 11 vulnerability values decreased with wcn size in caatinga and cerrado figs 10 and 11 ranging from 0 017 in m rigida to 0 308 in c flexuosa in caatinga tables 4 and 6 the vulnerability limits in 75 wcn of cerrado trees were higher from 0 052 in e gracilipes to 0 531 in aspidosperma tomentosum table 7 for a small wcn category carrying 100 nodes table 3 the value of vulnerability was the same 0 113 in caatinga and cerrado using the best fit equations r2 0 74 in figs 10 and 11 the maximum total of nodes in cerrado was 283 in m ligustroides table 7 a moderate size of about caatinga wcn using the wcn size of m ligustroides the vulnerability in caatinga was 0 056 and in cerrado 0 060 for a large wcn category carrying 601 nodes the vulnerability values were 0 034 in caatinga and 0 039 in cerrado therefore the vulnerability decreased steeper in caatinga with node addition resulting in lower values in middle and large wcn table 4 symmetry values also decreased with wcn size in caatinga and cerrado but with high variability in small wcn up to 100 nodes resulting in the lowest correlation coefficient r2 0 36 in figs 10 and 11 high symmetry variability in small wcn e g table 4 occurred due to the short and few distances between initial and final nodes a single node addition in wcn bearing less than 100 nodes may result in woody axes with the total of nodes far from the average distance between the initial and final nodes equations iii and iv therefore the coefficients of variation cv about symmetry in small and large wcn of c pyramidale table 4 were 99 and 33 respectively minimum symmetry values in caatinga and cerrado were similar with 0 015 in s brasiliensis bearing 763 nodes and 0 012 in p rotundifolia with 88 nodes tables 6 and 7 the decay of symmetry with node addition in middle and large wcn was less steep in caatinga than in cerrado resulting in a slower complexity increase with node insertion at the middle wcn of m ligustroides 283 nodes the complexity value by best fit equations in caatinga was 5931 fig 10 in the cerrado it outputs 15 457 fig 11 the abrupt increment in wcn complexity occurred only at large wcn in caatinga after 600 nodes while in cerrado it happened after 150 nodes figs 10 and 11 laterality had the lowest correlation coefficients among the eight properties in both vegetations r2 0 06 with wcn values in caatinga ranging from 0 244 in a colubrina table 6 to 0 507 in middle wcn of c pyramidale table 4 laterality values were usually lower in cerrado than in caatinga between 0 077 in a tomentosum and 0 395 in c brasiliense table 7 the large and middle wcn of c pyramidale did not show a difference in laterality table 4 the same happening between those three groups of trees in cerrado table 7 besides the coefficient of variation cv about values of laterality was only 5 between those ten species of caatinga in a range of wcn size of 36 806 nodes with cv equal to 83 table 6 despite the more conservative values of laterality in both vegetations the average value in caatinga 0 368 was higher p 0 05 than in cerrado 0 254 along with higher values of navigability complexity basitony sharing potential topological plasticity and lower vulnerability table 9 the maximum values of basitony were 80 9 in m rigida in caatinga and only 34 5 in e gracilipes in cerrado tables 6 and 7 despite fewer data pairs in caatinga the correlation coefficient of basitony as a function of size was far higher r2 0 89 than in cerrado r2 0 54 furthermore basitony augmented with size without stabilization only in caatinga the maximum sharing values were higher in caatinga 6 3 in a large wcn in c pyramidale table 4 than in cerrado 3 3 in e gracilipes table 7 sharing tended to be constant outputting values near 5 0 by best fit equation after 600 nodes in caatinga while in cerrado it happened after 250 nodes with sharing values near 2 5 figs 12 and 13 potential topological plasticity ptp had a high correlation coefficient r2 0 75 with wcn size in both vegetations increasing steeper and free of stabilization only in caatinga figs 12 and 13 it resulted in an average of ptp 6 8 times higher in caatinga than in cerrado table 9 due to the abrupt increase of ptp in middle and large wcn the maximum value was far higher in caatinga 1194 table 4 in large wcn of c pyramidale than in cerrado 224 table 7 in e gracilipes considering the maximum wcn size in cerrado 283 nodes the ptp was still higher in caatinga 186 than in the former vegetation 144 by the best fit equations in figs 12 and 13 3 5 a flowchart of decomposition topology and properties relationships in wcn results in tables 1 9 and figs 3 13 allowed the representation of decomposition topology and properties relationships in a wcn under substantial stresses fig 14 a high number of switch nodes high laterality and intense node addition are closed related to high hydraulic and vulnerability segmentation high laterality and basitony are robust conditioners of increased navigability besides high laterality and basitony intrinsically reduce the maximum crown height also laterality affects some properties sharing navigability and vulnerability and intensifies lateral space acquisition furthermore the high number of switch nodes increases the potential topological plasticity facilitating the even distribution of nodes along axes increasing symmetry and keeping complexity after node additions fig 14 4 discussion the concept of the uniqueness of the woody axis expressed in fig 1 is essential to grasp the difference between symmetry and complexity each woody axis is the largest topological wcn unit showing a unique geometrical identity symmetry captures how much even distribution of nodes happens along with the woody axis and complexity output how much symmetry is conserved with size increasing node addition in a given wcn therefore symmetry is a comparison between woody axes and complexity captures a feature in the above level of organization entire wcn showing symmetry according to the total nodes with node addition symmetry decays more slowly in caatinga than in cerrado it impacts the whole structural organization of wcn captured by complexity which increased much faster with size in cerrado figs 10 11 the high value of laterality in caatinga amplifies potential topological plasticity it promotes high symmetry and retains low complexity fig 14 equalizing the mass flow resistance at the wcn for reaching the final nodes it is highly significant to caatinga and evergreen cerrado tree species under a more severe water shortage the high number of the switch node also increases laterality decreases vulnerability and builds woody axes of higher orders likely resulting in high hydraulic and vulnerability segmentation fig 14 we demonstrated how the intense node addition and a significant number of switch nodes inserted near the initial node figs 2 4 and 7 could increase laterality and basitony edifying a safe hydraulic architecture under severe stresses the side effect is crown shortening figs 3 4 7 and 14 the principal component analysis figs 8 and 9 confirmed basitony and laterality as critical properties varying in opposition to vulnerability in both vegetations the same happened with navigability potential topological plasticity and sharing all these properties including vulnerability showed significant loadings on principal component 1 which explained 51 of the properties variation in cerrado and 59 in caatinga the extended wcn with intense node addition at the right pcas side such as large crowns of c pyramidale and evergreen tree species of cerrado figs 8 and 9 also presented a relatively high number of switch nodes and low vulnerability table 3 4 and 7 many nodes in caatinga s wcn growing in a semiarid area configure an apparent paradox because a node can act as a bottleneck of xylem sap flow huber 1928 zimmerman 1978 tyree and ewers 1991 anfodilo et al 2013 kotowska 2015 however an increased node population fig 14 can intensify the hydraulic and vulnerability segmentations johnson et al 2016 further high basitony in caatinga fig 12 tables 4 6 and 9 privileged the xylem sap flow in proximal portions of woody axes near the initial node in a successive construction of nodes those woody proximal regions are older thicker and more costly than distal ones collecting the xylem sap near the initial node and distributing it to sibling axes and distal portions figs 1 7 higher laterality and basitony e g figs 3 and 4 resulted in higher navigability and lowered vulnerability in caatinga it centralizes the distribution of sap flow in those basal portions with more shared nodes between axes these thicker basal woody parts are protected from embolisms according to vulnerability segmentation however it decreases the maximum wcn height figs 3 4 7 and 14 the tallest trees in the studied semiarid caatinga areas were s brasiliensis 7 8 m anandenhanthera macrocarpa benth brenan fabaceae 6 2 m and myracrodruon urundeuva allemão engl anacardiaceae 6 5 m trovão 2004 on the other hand the tallest tree in the cerrado study area was anadenathera falcata with 13 6 m prado measurement with rod bar on august 13 2021 the same species could grow across caatinga physiognomies reducing its size by high basitony and laterality according to the local water stress it may result in bushy or dwarf aspects andrade lima 1981 described the reduced size of mimosa species fabaceae and c pyramidales showing their dwarf condition in shrubby caatinga with shallow soil and high air temperature average 27 c the arborescent crown in coastal dune forests to bushy habit along dry river courses was evident in acacia karoo fabaceae growing in the itala game reserve in south africa archibald and bond 2003 regional and worldwide shreds of evidence support the correlation between decreasing tree or canopy maximum height with less water availability measured by climate aridity medina 1983 givnish et al 2014 fricker et al 2019 in areas with precipitation far exceeding potential evaporation near the equator archibold 2012 trees are higher in a global latitudinal gradient simard et al 2011 moles et al 2009 due to the considerable evapotranspiration between 1500 2000 mm in all areas in caatinga reddy 1983 the total precipitation and soil physical conditions are good predictors of water availability andrade lima 1981 sampaio et al 1981 and sampaio 1995 indicated rainfall soil depth and soil permeability as forecasters of maximum tree size in caatinga the typical caatinga formation shows a not too dense arboreous stratum reaching up to 15 m of height median and low caatinga in areas occurring 800 mm of rainfall per year on soils derived from crystalline rocks at the ends of a spectrum of physiognomies the caatinga community usually reaches 1 0 m tall in areas with 400 mm of rainfall on shallow sandy soils and 25 30 m in areas with 850 1000 mm on more profound eutrophic cambissol andrade lima 1981 the reduction in the size of woody species in regions with low water availability is now well documented holdridge 1967 whittaker 1975 bresinsky et al 2008 besides drought affects more large trees worldwide by decreasing growth and increasing mortality bennette et al 2015 grote et al 2016 ding et al 2017 meakem et al 2018 stoval et al 2019 drought causes a less favorable carbon balance increasing mortality risk o brien et al 2014 doughty et al 2015 however rather than carbon starvation hydraulics triggered tree death under induced drought experiments for 14 years in tropical rainforests principally in large trees with a diameter greater than 40 cm at breast height rowland et al 2015 tree height instead of stem diameter and crown exposure was the best predictor of drought vulnerability inducing mortality in a long term silvicultural experiment in the amazon shenkin et al 2018 the hydraulic architecture in tall trees could be suitable under mild water stress but severe water shortage deteriorates the carbon and water balances leading tall trees to death reduced basitony and laterality support the construction of tall trees figs 3 4 7 and 14 still it results in relatively low navigability and high vulnerability deteriorating the safety of water conducting pathways from initial to final nodes in wcn there are advantages to gaining longitudinal air space for light capturing during successional processes westoby 1998 or under limited light with ample water and nutrient access pretzsch et al 2018 however reduced laterality in tall trees restrains the symmetry and potential topological plasticity ptp fig 14 it hampers the even distribution of navigability and vulnerability in wcn increasing susceptibility to hydraulic failure the remarkable ptp in large wcn of caatinga tree species table 9 and fig 12 could offset some hydraulic constraints of relatively high complexity about cerrado table 9 high ptp handily modulates navigability vulnerability and node sharing between woody axes in different portions of wcn moreover the values of ptp of caatinga about cerrado increased exponentially without stabilization fig 12 resulting in an average value of 6 8 times higher in that semiarid vegetation table 9 cerrado vegetation s physiognomies cerradão cerrado stricto sensu campo cerrado campo sujo and campo limpo also differ by height and woody species density from a closed or semi open canopy reaching 18 m in height in cerradão to open formation with trees 3 m in campo sujo eiten 1972 coutinho 1990 the campo limpo physiognomy is a grassland free of woody species coutinho 1990 the water stress and interactions such as nutrient shortage and fire tailor cerrado physiognomies ribeiro and walter 1998 a gradient of decreasing nutrient availability and aluminum toxicity in cerrado soil usually is associated with a decrease in height and density of woody species from cerradão to campo sujo goodland and pollard 1973 lopes and cox 1977 neri et al 2013 vourlitis et al 2013 abrupt physiognomies transitions under equivalent water stress put nutrient availability and fire regime as significant conditioners across the forest grassland mosaic in the vast area occupied by cerrado vegetation in brazil coutinho 1990 fire affects cerrado woody plants of all sizes reducing the density and mean height and favoring smaller growth forms in burned areas moreira 1992 hoffmann and moreira 2002 lopes et al 2009 interestingly the reduced height 4 0 m of wcn in species of cerrado growing under low water availability on shallow rocky soils ribeiro and walter 1998 some species such as acosmium dasycarpum vogel yakovlev fabaceae which can grow into tall trees in seasonal cerrado areas are found in a dwarfish form in the hyper seasonal cerrado batalha et al 2005 the decreasing woody species density and height observed in caatinga also result from multiple stresses since an excess of radiation and temperature compound the water stress in leaves chaves et al 2003 therefore numerous stresses mediate the ecoclines in caatinga and cerrado but the water shortage is the principal in caatinga in each vegetation the strength of mutual influences of wcn variables about decomposition topology and properties changes according to the type and intensity of stresses fig 14 with four new properties presented here and those four introduced previously by prado et al 2020 the wcn model captures the strategies of the crown to conquest air space here we showed how basitony and laterality tailor the maximum crown height and how these properties are associated with various constraints in caatinga principally water shortage and cerrado multiple stresses vegetations also it was possible to infer the interdependence between the total nodes wcn size hydraulic segmentation and hydraulic vulnerability segmentation comparing caatinga and cerrado trees table 9 or deciduous and evergreen trees in cerrado table 7 the wcn model represents an integrated response fig 14 showing that the blueprinted crown architecture in the genome modulates according to the type dose and interactions of stresses hallé et al 1978 barthélémy et al 1989 hallé 2002 barthélémy and caraglio 2007 hence different projects of wcn genetically determined exposed to equivalent climate and edaphic conditions will keep their distinctions it is the case of functional groups performed by deciduous semideciduous and evergreen tree species coexisting in the same cerrado sensu stricto area damascos et al 2005 souza et al 2009a b souza et al 2011 borges et al 2014 lenti 2014 borges et al 2018 prado et al 2020 higher basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity found in evergreen than deciduous trees table 7 are consistent with their foliage persistence during the winter drought period in the cerrado vegetation area under drought carrying the whole foliage area the evergreen trees demand short distances counted in connectors to cross the wcn for attending the final nodes by xylem mass flow higher sharing values in evergreen than deciduous trees and in caatinga tree species showed their greater construction efficiency of woody axes to pervade air space it is essential in a permanent foliage area subjected to drought in a wcn bearing the highest node population studied in cerrado phenological groups table 7 the more significant node population promotes hydraulic and vulnerability segmentation in evergreen trees furthermore high potential plasticity in evergreen species table 7 supports a more even distribution of their high values of navigability and vulnerability fig 14 we expected a higher maximum height of wcn in deciduous than evergreen tree species growing in the same cerrado sensu stricto physiognomy since basitony was lower in deciduous trees the maximum average size after measurements in at least five adult individuals per species was higher in six deciduous 3 45 1 17 m than in six evergreens 2 89 0 74 m tree species in the studied sensu stricto cerrado physiognomy souza et al 2011 venâncio 2016

individual trees lenti 2014 were higher in ten deciduous species 3 9 1 9 and 5 7 m than in 5 evergreens species 3 6 1 7 and 5 6 m the usefulness of the wcn model will improve in association with automatized laser woody crown reconstruction åkerblom et al 2018 hackenberg et al 2015 raumonen et al 2013 monitoring the vulnerability of individuals populations and communities with limited development caused by severe stress the summary of our model in a flowchart presented in fig 14 improves our hydraulic understanding at the crown s level explains the mosaic of physiognomies in each vegetation and facilitates the identification of functional groups of woody species 5 conclusions we showed how combinations of woody axes decomposition and topology could modulate the architecture s blueprint the eight entangle properties presented here captured these combinations high basitony laterality and intense node addition protect woody species against hydraulic failure by decreasing vulnerability and increasing navigability in wcn inherently reducing the maximum crown height it shapes the individual crown and woody community contributing to tailoring each physiognomy or functional group in every vegetation our model accommodates the hydraulic and vulnerability segmentation into the whole wcn explaining why tall trees are more vulnerable to hydraulic failure and how

24214,we determined the decomposition topology and properties of the woody crown network wcn in tree species growing under semiarid and rainy climates in caatinga and cerrado vegetations nodes in wcn were branching regions and connectors were the woody axes networking nodes or emerging from them decomposition and topology combinations output new wcn properties laterality sharing basitony and potential topological plasticity all new properties were higher in caatinga than cerrado especially in large wcn bearing more than 600 nodes evergreen trees of cerrado and caatinga shortened the distance from initial to final nodes by high basitony facilitating water access to the final nodes and their annexed organs the superior number of nodes found in cerrado s evergreen trees and the caatinga trees intensified the hydraulic segmentation and vulnerability segmentation edifying suitable wcn for working under more intense water stress laterality basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity uncovered the space filling disparity strategies between deciduous and evergreen trees in the same sensu stricto cerrado area the reduced maximum wcn height with increasing water shortage from tall to shrubby caatinga physiognomies appears associated with high basitony and laterality the same possibly happens across cerrado s physiognomies from tall cerradão to grassland

intensity of multiple ambient pressures keywords basitony caatinga cerrado hydraulic architecture laterality topological plasticity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the woody axes have the conduits responsible for the xylem and phloem sap distribution connecting the annexed aerial organs with the underground compartment the branching regions of axes are the nodes and the connections between them or merely emerging from them are the connectors of a woody crown network wcn souza et al 2011 prado et al 2020 the resistance to moving the water through the xylem over a path crossing the wcn arises with node and connector accumulations due to the further interactions between fluid and the conductor and the potential gain in altitude of the water column peres 2015 hauser 1996 the node region is a site for reducing the leaf specific hydraulic conductivity measured as the water flow per time per pressure gradient divided by transpiring leaf area in each woody axis ewers and zimmerman 1984 short length small diameter and low density of conduits drop the hydraulic conductivity in the xylem at branch junctions zimmerman 1978 tyree and ewers 1991 anfodillo et al 2013 kotowska 2015 the non functional spiral xylem at the branching region slanting axis and larger parent diameter than the emerging woody branch favor the water flow in parental woody segments lev yagun and aloni 1990 eisner et al 2002 the leaf specific conductivity is higher in the stem than in branches and higher in first order than in succeeding second order branches after branching zimmermann 1983 tyree et al 1983 ewers and zimmermann 1984 tyree and sperry 1988 cruiziat et al 2002 the stratification of woody axes in wcn by strahler order accounted for approximately 70 of the total variation in leaf specific conductivity in a 7 m tall tree fraxinus americana joyce and steiner 1995 hence the node region results in hydraulic segmentation of wcn sensu zimmermann 1983 outcoming leaf specific conductivity lower in distal woody axes than in proximal ones due to significant branch region resistances the hydraulic segmentation principle gave rise to hydraulic vulnerability segmentation proposing that distal crown portions are more vulnerable to cavitation than costly basal ones tyree and ewers 1991 tyree and zimmermann 2002 hydraulic and vulnerability segmentations participate in the plant hydraulic architecture protecting thicker proximal aerial woody portions responsible for storing and conducting water toward distal woody regions and their corresponding annexed organs charrier et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 rodriguez dominguez et al 2018 despite the branching system monopodial or sympodial or privileged position on parental axes a given node s hydraulic failure or detachment will interrupt the xylem supply to all nodes and connectors distal it therefore nodes attachment arrangement by connectors topology is pivotal to determining how many nodes will no longer receive the xylem sap after a node hydraulic failure or detachment in a wcn the combination of decomposition and topology gave rise to the four properties of wcn prado et al 2020 those properties uncovered the distribution of nodes in the woody axes population symmetry and how much it is conserved with size complexity the properties also captured how many nodes and connectors are necessary to cross the wcn from the initial to final nodes navigability and how many nodes will disengage after each detachment from the total nodes vulnerability if the lateral instead of rectilinear node addition is frequent building new final nodes and branching orders the vulnerability drops and navigability increases steeply with wcn size prado et al 2020 therefore the wcn hydraulic architecture is intrinsically associated with its decomposition in nodes and connectors with its woody axes topological arrangement and its properties resulted combining decomposition and topology joyce and steiner 1995 tyree and zimmermann 2002 souza et al 2011 prado et al 2020 here we study tree species with a wide variation in the total number of nodes and topology of woody axes in the wcn of trees growing in the semiarid area of caatinga and in a rainy area of cerrado vegetation in brazil despite the high resistance to xylem sap flow at the node region the caatinga s woody species edify notable segmented wcn by branching araújo et al 2007 moro et al 2016 queiroz et al 2017 caatinga is south america s largest tropical dry forest silva et al 2017 occurring in flattened depressions 300 500 m a s l in northeastern brazil it is submitted to a rainfall regime between 240 900 mm per year with 7 11 months free of rain and average air temperature between 25 30 c prado 2003 sampaio 1995 santos et al 2011 water availability is the most important abiotic factor in selecting morphological and physiological traits in the plant body and the principal driver defining biogeographical subregions in caatinga araújo et al 2007 silva and souza 2018 the caatinga area s climate is semiarid because the precipitation potential evapotranspiration rate is 0 65 sampaio 2010 the hampered growth limiting the longitudinal air space acquisition of caatinga woody species occurs due to long periods under severe water stress vasconcelos sobrinho 1970 andrade lima 1981 1982 lemos and rodal 2002 silva et al 2017 how can decomposition and topology mitigate the inherent increase in hydraulic resistance during the wcn growth by intense branching and consequent node addition in caatinga trees we tried to answer by combining decomposition and topology outputting new properties based on the former wcn model prado et al 2020 and applying it to crowns with a wide variation in the number of nodes under caatinga s natural conditions furthermore it was a chance to review some data and experiment with the new properties in already skeletonized 15 species distributed in deciduous semideciduous and evergreen cerrado trees souza et al 2011 prado et al 2020 we investigated if novel properties could capture other significant differences in wcn separating those leaf phenological groups of trees in cerrado moreover former and new combinations of decomposition and topology could reveal how the wcn acquires lateral and longitudinal air space achieving different maximum heights with water availability in caatinga and under multiple stresses across the cerrado physiognomies cerrado is the second most extensive vegetation domain in latin america initially

marcuzzo et al 2008 the adult woody community in cerrado can keep favorable water status in plant bodies across the year prado et al 2004 by shedding leaves and accessing by roots the permanent available water in the soil at layers more profound than 0 85 m franco 2002 oliveira et al al 2005 despite the relatively easy accessibility of water in most soils of cerrado the woody species modulate the foliage area seasonally camargo et al 2018 deciduous semideciduous and evergreen cerrado trees are significantly different in geometric decomposition and topological wcn features souza et al 2009b souza et al 2011 prado et al 2020 the interdependency of wcn features resulted in distinctive strategies for acquiring storing and using resources and easy identification of functional groups is the leaf persistence in cerrado s trees prado et al 2020 borges et al 2018 our approach could shed light on whole crown hydraulic architecture understanding the strategies of woody crown development under stresses jonhson et al 2016 therefore we aimed to know the critical control points of the entire crown hydraulic architecture modulated by decomposition topology and properties due to the drop in conductivity detected at the branching region we hypothesized that the total number of nodes is an essential decomposition component in wcn and hydraulic architecture those former and new properties may capture crucial advanced features about the whole wcn hydraulics and their relationship with maximum crown height under intense and moderate water shortages in caatinga and cerrado vegetations 2 materials and methods 2 1 area climate and the study species of caatinga and cerrado vegetations we conducted the study in a fragment of caatinga vegetation at the fazenda pocinho 7 29 46 s and 35 58 12 w in barra de santana municipality state of paraíba brazil the area is in the microregion called cariri oriental borborema mesoregion aesa 2018 according to the köppen classification köppen 1948 the study area is bswh a hot semiarid type with a dry season reaching a period of nine to ten months and an average annual rainfall 600 mm with rains distributed irregularly across the year paraíba 2007 aesa 2018 the minimum temperatures are between 18 and 22 c in july and august and the maximum is 28 31 c in november and december the average relative air humidity values are between

white forest andrade lima 1982 ibge 2012 we selected 11 tree species in caatinga growing in sunny areas without wcn damage or overlapped by surrounding woody species in the field ten of those 11 species totalized 4191 woody branching regions nodes covering broad wcn sizes from 36 to 806 nodes table 1 in an endemic caatinga deciduous tree species cenostigma pyramidale tul gagnon g p lewis we selected 14 individuals totalizing 3968 nodes distributed in three wcn sizes table 2 the cynophalla flexuosa l presl and those three individuals of c pyramidale showing small wcn tables 1 and 2 with stem diameter near the soil surface 3 0 cm or height 100 cm could be considered juvenile rodal et al 2013 the drawings with captions and the data of decomposition topology and properties captured by the wcn model from each skeletonized caatinga species are available in the zenodo public repository at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6578043 for those ten species and in https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6578235 for 14 individuals of c pyramidale also we utilized the skeletonized wcn obtained by souza et al 2011 in 75 crowns of tree species of cerrado vegetation distributed in 15 species five individuals per species totalizing 5354 nodes the drawings and data of decomposition topology and those eight properties obtained by our model of each skeletonized cerrado wcn are available in the zenodo repository https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6575067 those trees grew under natural conditions in a most common physiognomy stricto sensu of cerrado vegetation in a reservoir of 86 ha located at 850 m above sea level in são carlos city são paulo state brazil at 21 58 22 00 s and 47 51 47 52 w following the köppen climatic classification this region is between aw and cwa a tropical climate with dry winter and wet summer the rainy season occurs between october march and the dry season between april and september prado et al 2004 monteiro and prado 2006 the historical 1939 2007 average values standard deviation of annual precipitation and air temperature were 1420 168 mm and 22 0 4 c souza et al 2009a 2 2 representing the wcn in a bi dimensional space the wcn representation in a bi dimensional space by drawing followed the methodology described by prado et al 2020 the branching regions were the nodes no and the woody crown segments connecting the nodes or merely emerging from them were the connectors co the resulting tree graph with its subgraphs is an oriented network with a single pathway between two nodes rosen 2019 without an alternative pathway forming network loops or triangles the wcn is free of shortcuts making impossible node clustering watts and strogatz 1998 barabási and oltvai 2004 prado et al 2020 the highly connected nodes with more than four connectors as emission nodes are rare in wcn outputting an exponential decay of the probability of a node having a k connector pk as a function of the number of k connectors on nodes prado et al 2020 we adopted three wcn size categories for the tree species c pyramidale individuals up to 100 nodes comprised the small category trees having between 101 600 and 601 900 nodes covered the middle and large wcn classes table 2 we captured the no and co distribution in wcn by drawing the woody axes from the root collar following the recommendations highlighted in prado et al 2020 the initial node in was the first node from the collar region towards the apical meristem the wcn branching began in the in the regular node rn showed three co and the emission node en supported four or more co the last nodes near the apical meristem were the final nodes fn in each wcn the woody axes are those segments composed of successive nodes presenting at least one unshared node between axes the final node performing a unique space signature in a wcn the number of woody axes in a wcn equals the summation of final nodes fn 2 3 decomposition topology and properties utilized in the woody crown network model we obtained the decomposition topology and properties in the woody crown network model following prado et al 2020 the decomposition values in each wcn were the total number of nodes no representing the size of wcn the total of connectors co and the total number of regular rn final fn and emission nodes en we capture the topology in each wcn determining the distances in connectors between the initial and final nodes in fn and between initial and emission nodes in en we introduced one more component in a woody axis about wcn decomposition the switched node which receives at least one lateral connection section 2 4 1 therefore it was possible to introduce the total of switch nodes sn in decomposition and the distance between the initial node to the switch node in the topology navigability property considers the size no and the average amount of co needed to cross a wcn indicated by the distances in fn the total number of distances equals the fn fig 1 the no divided by the average of the distances in fn outputs the navigability of a wcn prado et al 2020 the navigability captures the wcn s ability to acquire air space by node addition minimizing the inherent increase of hydraulic resistance to reach the final nodes i navigability no in fn fn where no any node counted once regardless of its category in initial node fn final node in fn distance in connectors between the initial and final nodes the vulnerability was the average of lost nodes after each regular and emission node detachment excluding final and initial nodes detachment divided by the size of a wcn the number of regular and emission nodes considered to obtain vulnerability equals the total of nodes minus the final nodes plus one no fn 1 vulnerability output is the average number of unengaged nodes including the detached node from the water column after a node hydraulic failure in wcn the disconnected node must be counted as a lost node in each node attack the detached node was not counted as a lost node by prado et al 2020 it resulted in an underestimated average value of vulnerability between 18 21 in deciduous semideciduous and evergreen cerrado tree species all corrected values of vulnerability for cerrado trees are presented here in the results table 7 ii vulnerability i 1 n lni no fn 1 no where lni total of lost nodes including the attacked node after detachment of the node i as regular or emission node no any node counted once regardless of its type fn final nodes we captured the asymmetry of a wcn by measuring on each axis how far the amount of co in in fn distances is about the average in fn distance divided by the number of in fn paths equal to fn the result is the population variance of in fn representing the variability of all distances to cross the wcn prado et al 2020 population instead of sample variance must be used since it is calculated from population data not sample data the sample variation was misapplied by prado et al 2020 in deciduous semideciduous and evergreen cerrado tree species underestimating the average values between 11 15 in each leaf phenological group all corrected values of symmetry about cerrado tree species are presented here in table 7 iii asymmetry in f n 1 avg 2 in f n 2 avg 2 in f n n avg 2 σ fn where in initial node fn final node in fn distance in connectors between initial and final nodes avg average of the distances counted in connectors between the in fn nodes the inverse of asymmetry was the symmetry of wcn prado et al 2020 by considering the node as a particular site for reducing the hydraulic conductivity symmetry equation iv performs how homogeneous the hydraulic paths are between the highest topological units the woody axes in the wcn the complexity property captures the homogeneity of hydraulics considering all woody axes dividing the size per symmetry equation v it reflects the hydraulic s homogeneity contemplating the whole wcn therefore symmetry and complexity outline the distribution uniformity of the other six properties in the wcn iv symmetry 1 asymmetry v complexity no symmetry where no any node counted once regardless of its type 2 4 the new constituents of decomposition topology and properties in the woody crown network model 2 4 1 lateral node addition the switch node and its distance about the initial node it is possible to find one or more lateral node addition from the initial to the final node in every woody axis in each wcn the lateral connection creates a superior axis order attached to a parental axis one more final node and a further distance between the initial and the new final node fig 1 those lateral connections occur along the axes on the switch nodes sn the first sn from final to initial node separates the axis into shared and unshared node portions fig 1 the number of axes equals the final nodes in each wcn fig 1 the first wcn axis cannot be lateral but can receive a lateral node addition therefore the number of lateral connections in a wcn equals the number of axes fn minus one in fig 1 the initial node receives two lateral connections one node can be an emission node bearing more than two raised connectors prado et al 2020 enabling the sn to be also an emission node in fig 1 the initial node is an emission node and an sn therefore the initial node can show one or more lateral node additions resulting in zero connectors about the distance between itself and the nearest sn figs 1 and 2 counting the distance in many connectors from the initial node to sn is possible denoting how proximal the lateral insertions are about the initial node fig 2 the number of lateral axes per node outputs the laterality property which value decreases by rectilinear node addition fig 3 the lateral insertions proximity to the initial node impacts navigability vulnerability complexity symmetry and the maximum crown height figs 3 and 4 2 4 2 laterality and the sites of lateral attachments the number of lateral insertions equals the total number of final nodes minus one since the first parental axis cannot be lateral laterality lat captures how many lateral insertions are per node by dividing the total number of lateral additions by the total number of nodes in each wcn vi laterality fn 1 no where fn final nodes no any node counted once regardless of its type the number of lateral insertions is essential in featuring the wcn topology modulating the properties by creating new axes final nodes and higher axis orders alternatively the rectilinear node insertion increases the number of nodes in an axis impacting the symmetry between axes the lateral insertions improve navigability by shortening the average distance to cross the wcn and decreasing vulnerability by creating a new order axis prado et al 2020 besides lateral as an alternative to rectilinear node insertion promotes the adjacent instead of longitudinal air space acquisition figs 3 and 4 the impact of laterality on the other wcn properties depends on the lateral attachments distance from the initial node a new lateral axis developing near the initial node raises navigability and complexity it decreases vulnerability and symmetry as illustrated in fig 3 from a to b and from d to e wcn rectilinear node addition on a new developing axis near the initial node equalizes the number of nodes between new and old axes increasing symmetry and decreasing complexity as depicted in fig 3 from b to c and from c to d wcn by node addition privileging positions near the initial node the height will increase only after a rectilinear node insertion at the top of the highest axis like in fig 3 d wcn reaching 9 8 units alternatively lateral new attachment far from the initial node at the apex of parental axes has a low impact on navigability and vulnerability from a to e wcn fig 4 maximum height and complexity in fig 4 raised steeper from c to d wcn symmetry decreased abruptly after some rectilinear node insertions far from the initial node in fig 4 d wcn there were 11 instead of 3 nodes shared between axes in e wcn comparing figs 4 and 3 furthermore the maximum wcn height in fig 4 increased from 8 3 to 10 6 units due to the nodes connection near the apex of a parental axis far from the initial node in both types of wcn figs 3 and 4 laterality increased by lateral and decreased by rectilinear node insertion hence lateral insertions at the bottom of the parental axis on the proximal portion near the initial node increase navigability and decrease vulnerability this basitonic topology also promotes high symmetry and low complexity values after rectilinear node addition by equalizing the number of nodes between axes fig 3 however connections at proximal portions of the parental axis near the initial node restrict the maximum height due to the impact of lateral axis attachments on properties and height it is essential to measure how far the switch nodes are from the initial node determining the basitony property in each wcn 2 4 3 basitony basitony indicates the preferential development of lateral axes at the base of a vertical stem or shoot troll 1937 barhélémy and caraglio 2007 here basitony designates the proximity of lateral axes insertions to the initial node if lateral insertion is near the parental axis s apex it is more distal to the initial node alternatively if lateral insertion is at the base of a parental axis it is more proximal to the initial node therefore counting the number of connectors from the initial node to each switch node at the lateral insertion is necessary to capture basitony the number of total nodes in wcn divided by the average distance from the initial to switch nodes outputs the basitony property vii basitony no in sn 1 in snn n where no any node counted once regardless of its type in initial node sn switch node the basitony values about e wcn with the same number of nodes axes and the distribution of nodes between axes were 30 0 and 5 4 in figs 3 and 4 higher basitony resulted in higher navigability lower vulnerability and reduced crown height at the end of attachments in e wcn in fig 3 about fig 4 otherwise the low basitony in fig 4 minimally impacted navigability and vulnerability after some node additions from a to e wcn in each axis the number of nodes the total of lateral attachments and their insertion sites near the base or apex regulate the number of shared nodes depicted by the green circles in e wcn figs 3 and 4 a parental axis can emit sibling axes more proximal or distal to the initial node sharing some nodes along its path according to the site of lateral axis attachment fig 2 sharing nodes between axes can decrease the total number of nodes to construct a wcn with the same number of axes and the average distance between the initial and the final nodes indicating the efficiency of air space acquisition by node addition fig 5 2 4 4 sharing two wcn with the same number of woody axes and the average distance from initial to final nodes may differ in size no due to the distinct topology by changing the number of nodes shared between axes node sharing lessens the total nodes increasing air space acquisition efficiency by saving nodes fig 5 also in a wcn having more than one axis the initial node is always shared by all axes figs 1 7 for calculating the sharing property sha it is necessary to obtain the average of nodes per axis by counting those nodes directly or counting the number of connectors in each axis in a wcn the number of nodes in a woody axis equals the number of connectors from the initial to the final node adding one the average number of nodes per axis multiplied by the number of axes fn results in a proxy of total nodes in that wcn without shared nodes between axes apart from the initial node this result minus the actual number of nodes outputs how many nodes the wcn did not build and kept the same number of axes and the average distance from initial to final nodes due to the physical sharing of nodes between axes orders this last outcome divided by the total number of nodes represents the sharing value of a wcn viii sharing in fn 1 in fnn fn 1 fn no no where in initial node fn final node no any node counted once regardless of its type in fn distance counted in connectors between the initial and final nodes lower basitony results in higher sharing and height between wcn with the same number of nodes axes and distribution of nodes like e wcn on figs 3 and 4 unquestionably lateral node addition promotes sharing sha and the number of axis orders figs 1 5 increasing the diversity of sites for node appearance in each wcn for example a new node may appear after or before a switch node in a parental axis supporting a lateral node connection furthermore a new node may appear on a parental or sibling axis therefore lateral node addition increases the possibilities of attachments raising the potential topological plasticity in a wcn 2 4 5 potential topological plasticity it is possible to ask at least three questions about a new node s topological position in a given wcn 1 on which woody axis will the new node appear the number of possibilities depends on how many axes a wcn has the number of axes equals the total number of final nodes in a wcn 2 will the new node attach laterally or rectilinearly in a given axis therefore lateral and rectilinear positions of attachments duplicate the possibility of inserting a node in each axis 3 the new node attachment will happen after or before a switch node considering a woody axis path from the initial node navigability and basitony will increase major if the node addition occurs near the initial node in a more shared portion of nodes alternatively the increment in navigability and basitony will be lesser if the new node appears somewhat farther from the initial node in an axis s less shared or unshared node portion figs 3 and 4 irrespective of the number of axes connected to a switch node the number of positions before or after a switch node for adding a new node equals the total of the switch nodes plus one fig 6 considering those three questions above we can capture the potential topological plasticity ptp computing how many possibilities exist to add a new node equation ix the number 2 multiplying the total number of woody axes fn in equation ix is about those two possibilities to insert a node laterally or rectilinearly in each axis irrespective of the total number of nodes the first switch node added in a wcn creates two more opportunities for new node insertion a and b wcn fig 6 the subsequent switch node additions make only one extra possibility of inserting a new node about the positions after and before the switch nodes from b to c wcn fig 6 ix potential topological plasticity 2 fn sn 1 where fn final node sn switch node from equation ix it is possible to note that lateral node addition increments ptp due to the increase of final and switch nodes any rectilinear node addition on woody axes does not alter the components in equation ix high ptp facilitates the homogeneous distribution of properties in wcn due to more possibilities of sites of connections changing the topology by node addition moreover wcn with the same number of nodes differing in potential topological plasticity by lateral connections may have higher navigability symmetry and sharing values along with lower complexity vulnerability and height fig 7 2 5 statistical analysis we organized the datasets and obtained the average standard deviation values of decomposition topology and properties in studied wcn of caatinga and cerrado vegetations by microsoft excel software 2019 mso version 2207 we used the shapiro wilk test in the paleontological statistics software package for education and data analysis past version 3 26 hammer et al 2001 to verify the normal distribution of each dataset by past package we applied anova tukey kramer or kruskal wallis dunn according to the normality output of datasets to validate significative differences p 0 05 between averages the multivariate principal component analysis with past was performed in a correlation matrix using the eight properties obtained in 75 and 24 wcn in cerrado and caatinga trees we utilized those eight properties and the r software r core team 2020 to apply multivariate nonparametric analysis of variance by bray curti s distance comparing pairs of leaf phenological groups of cerrado trees distributed in deciduous de semideciduous sd and evergreen ev 3 results 3 1 caatinga woody crown networks in c pyramidale the total nodes and crown height differed across the wcn sizes and stem diameter near the soil surface was higher in large wcn table 2 the basic construction unit of those wcn was the node with three connectors 94 of the nodes resulting in different average values of regular nodes across the wcn categories and a comparable ratio 2 0 of total connectors per total of nodes table 3 despite most nodes with three connectors we found a significant increase in final and switch nodes between small middle and large wcn the highest distances from the initial to final node switch and emission nodes occurred in large c pyramidale wcn table 3 average values of navigability and potential topological plasticity increased significantly across wcn sizes table 4 alternatively vulnerability decreased from small to large wcn symmetry average values were equal between wcn categories the intense node addition near the initial node increased basitony from small to large classes making the c pyramidale more navigable and complex with more positions to add a new node elevated topological plasticity and less vulnerable without impacting symmetry in extended wcn still the sharing raised in middle and large wcn depicted the increasing efficiency of woody axes built by node insertions table 4 the ranges of the total number of nodes 36 825 connectors 77 1748 and the ratio between the total of nodes and total of connectors around 2 0 were similar in c pyramidale and ten caatinga tree species tables 3 and 5 the regular nodes in ten caatinga tree species were between 83 and 99 with an average of 91 as we found in c pyramidale there were increasing distances between the initial and the other types of nodes with wcn size in those ten caatinga tree species table 5 along with increasing complexity basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity toward extended crows table 6 furthermore vulnerability decreased with wcn size from c flexuosa to m rigida table 6 hence decomposition topology and properties trends with node addition were similar between those 14 wcn of c pyramidale and the other ten wcn in caatinga tree species 3 2 cerrado woody crown networks the average values of total nodes and complexity differed across cerrado s deciduous semideciduous and evergreen trees table 7 evergreen species also showed higher average values than deciduous trees in several properties navigability basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity on the other hand evergreen species had lower values of symmetry and vulnerability than deciduous trees laterality did not diverge over the cerrado leaf phenological groups table 7 deciduous trees appeared separated from evergreen cerrado species in a multivariate nonparametric analysis of variance using the eight properties together or separated into two groups table 8 semidecidous species showed intermediate property values with symmetry equal to deciduous species but navigability vulnerability basitony and sharing average values were similar to evergreen trees table 7 3 3 principal component analyses pca of woody crown network properties in caatinga and cerrado the pattern was similar to the vector distribution representing the variation of the eight properties in caatinga and cerrado in a pca s bi dimensional space figs 8 and 9 regardless of the vegetation the variations in vulnerability were in opposition to navigability basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity furthermore negative variations of vulnerability and symmetry and positive variations of most properties laterality sharing navigability potential topological plasticity basitony and complexity were associated with extended wcn settled on the pca s right side in both vegetations figs 8 and 9 on the left side of caatinga s pca fig 8 it is possible to find the wcn from 36 c pyramidale and c flexuosa to 358 p stipulaceae nodes we found the wcn between 400 z joazeiro and 825 c pyramidale nodes on the right side principal components 1 and 2 explained 59 and 19 of data variation in caatinga fig 8 on the left side of cerrado s pca we found wcn with 4 k variabilis and 88 p rotundifolia nodes the wcn bearing 44 c brasiliensis and 283 m ligustroides nodes are on the right pca s side fig 9 principal components 1 and 2 explained 51 and 18 of data variation in cerrado with deciduous and evergreen species preferentially occupying the left and the right pca s sides semideciduous trees appeared scattered between deciduous and evergreen species fig 9 in the same group of leaf phenological group the extended wcn carrying a more significant number of nodes occurred at the right side about individuals showing fewer nodes fig 9 3 4 caatinga vs cerrado woody crown network as a function of node addition we found similar patterns in decomposition and properties by node addition in caatinga and cerrado with a switch node increasing vulnerability and symmetry decreasing and most of the properties rising tables 3 7 on the other hand the range of values and the relationship of properties as a function of total nodes wcn size differed between caatinga and cerrado figs 10 13 in caatinga the navigability ranged from 4 3 in c flexuosa table 6 to 64 2 in large wcn of c pyramidale table 4 increasing exponentially and steeper after wcn with 600 nodes fig 10 otherwise the cerrado navigability values ranged from 1 6 in a tomentosum to 24 9 in e gracilipes table 7 increasing almost linearly and reaching a plateau near 17 5 after 150 nodes fig 11 vulnerability values decreased with wcn size in caatinga and cerrado figs 10 and 11 ranging from 0 017 in m rigida to 0 308 in c flexuosa in caatinga tables 4 and 6 the vulnerability limits in 75 wcn of cerrado trees were higher from 0 052 in e gracilipes to 0 531 in aspidosperma tomentosum table 7 for a small wcn category carrying 100 nodes table 3 the value of vulnerability was the same 0 113 in caatinga and cerrado using the best fit equations r2 0 74 in figs 10 and 11 the maximum total of nodes in cerrado was 283 in m ligustroides table 7 a moderate size of about caatinga wcn using the wcn size of m ligustroides the vulnerability in caatinga was 0 056 and in cerrado 0 060 for a large wcn category carrying 601 nodes the vulnerability values were 0 034 in caatinga and 0 039 in cerrado therefore the vulnerability decreased steeper in caatinga with node addition resulting in lower values in middle and large wcn table 4 symmetry values also decreased with wcn size in caatinga and cerrado but with high variability in small wcn up to 100 nodes resulting in the lowest correlation coefficient r2 0 36 in figs 10 and 11 high symmetry variability in small wcn e g table 4 occurred due to the short and few distances between initial and final nodes a single node addition in wcn bearing less than 100 nodes may result in woody axes with the total of nodes far from the average distance between the initial and final nodes equations iii and iv therefore the coefficients of variation cv about symmetry in small and large wcn of c pyramidale table 4 were 99 and 33 respectively minimum symmetry values in caatinga and cerrado were similar with 0 015 in s brasiliensis bearing 763 nodes and 0 012 in p rotundifolia with 88 nodes tables 6 and 7 the decay of symmetry with node addition in middle and large wcn was less steep in caatinga than in cerrado resulting in a slower complexity increase with node insertion at the middle wcn of m ligustroides 283 nodes the complexity value by best fit equations in caatinga was 5931 fig 10 in the cerrado it outputs 15 457 fig 11 the abrupt increment in wcn complexity occurred only at large wcn in caatinga after 600 nodes while in cerrado it happened after 150 nodes figs 10 and 11 laterality had the lowest correlation coefficients among the eight properties in both vegetations r2 0 06 with wcn values in caatinga ranging from 0 244 in a colubrina table 6 to 0 507 in middle wcn of c pyramidale table 4 laterality values were usually lower in cerrado than in caatinga between 0 077 in a tomentosum and 0 395 in c brasiliense table 7 the large and middle wcn of c pyramidale did not show a difference in laterality table 4 the same happening between those three groups of trees in cerrado table 7 besides the coefficient of variation cv about values of laterality was only 5 between those ten species of caatinga in a range of wcn size of 36 806 nodes with cv equal to 83 table 6 despite the more conservative values of laterality in both vegetations the average value in caatinga 0 368 was higher p 0 05 than in cerrado 0 254 along with higher values of navigability complexity basitony sharing potential topological plasticity and lower vulnerability table 9 the maximum values of basitony were 80 9 in m rigida in caatinga and only 34 5 in e gracilipes in cerrado tables 6 and 7 despite fewer data pairs in caatinga the correlation coefficient of basitony as a function of size was far higher r2 0 89 than in cerrado r2 0 54 furthermore basitony augmented with size without stabilization only in caatinga the maximum sharing values were higher in caatinga 6 3 in a large wcn in c pyramidale table 4 than in cerrado 3 3 in e gracilipes table 7 sharing tended to be constant outputting values near 5 0 by best fit equation after 600 nodes in caatinga while in cerrado it happened after 250 nodes with sharing values near 2 5 figs 12 and 13 potential topological plasticity ptp had a high correlation coefficient r2 0 75 with wcn size in both vegetations increasing steeper and free of stabilization only in caatinga figs 12 and 13 it resulted in an average of ptp 6 8 times higher in caatinga than in cerrado table 9 due to the abrupt increase of ptp in middle and large wcn the maximum value was far higher in caatinga 1194 table 4 in large wcn of c pyramidale than in cerrado 224 table 7 in e gracilipes considering the maximum wcn size in cerrado 283 nodes the ptp was still higher in caatinga 186 than in the former vegetation 144 by the best fit equations in figs 12 and 13 3 5 a flowchart of decomposition topology and properties relationships in wcn results in tables 1 9 and figs 3 13 allowed the representation of decomposition topology and properties relationships in a wcn under substantial stresses fig 14 a high number of switch nodes high laterality and intense node addition are closed related to high hydraulic and vulnerability segmentation high laterality and basitony are robust conditioners of increased navigability besides high laterality and basitony intrinsically reduce the maximum crown height also laterality affects some properties sharing navigability and vulnerability and intensifies lateral space acquisition furthermore the high number of switch nodes increases the potential topological plasticity facilitating the even distribution of nodes along axes increasing symmetry and keeping complexity after node additions fig 14 4 discussion the concept of the uniqueness of the woody axis expressed in fig 1 is essential to grasp the difference between symmetry and complexity each woody axis is the largest topological wcn unit showing a unique geometrical identity symmetry captures how much even distribution of nodes happens along with the woody axis and complexity output how much symmetry is conserved with size increasing node addition in a given wcn therefore symmetry is a comparison between woody axes and complexity captures a feature in the above level of organization entire wcn showing symmetry according to the total nodes with node addition symmetry decays more slowly in caatinga than in cerrado it impacts the whole structural organization of wcn captured by complexity which increased much faster with size in cerrado figs 10 11 the high value of laterality in caatinga amplifies potential topological plasticity it promotes high symmetry and retains low complexity fig 14 equalizing the mass flow resistance at the wcn for reaching the final nodes it is highly significant to caatinga and evergreen cerrado tree species under a more severe water shortage the high number of the switch node also increases laterality decreases vulnerability and builds woody axes of higher orders likely resulting in high hydraulic and vulnerability segmentation fig 14 we demonstrated how the intense node addition and a significant number of switch nodes inserted near the initial node figs 2 4 and 7 could increase laterality and basitony edifying a safe hydraulic architecture under severe stresses the side effect is crown shortening figs 3 4 7 and 14 the principal component analysis figs 8 and 9 confirmed basitony and laterality as critical properties varying in opposition to vulnerability in both vegetations the same happened with navigability potential topological plasticity and sharing all these properties including vulnerability showed significant loadings on principal component 1 which explained 51 of the properties variation in cerrado and 59 in caatinga the extended wcn with intense node addition at the right pcas side such as large crowns of c pyramidale and evergreen tree species of cerrado figs 8 and 9 also presented a relatively high number of switch nodes and low vulnerability table 3 4 and 7 many nodes in caatinga s wcn growing in a semiarid area configure an apparent paradox because a node can act as a bottleneck of xylem sap flow huber 1928 zimmerman 1978 tyree and ewers 1991 anfodilo et al 2013 kotowska 2015 however an increased node population fig 14 can intensify the hydraulic and vulnerability segmentations johnson et al 2016 further high basitony in caatinga fig 12 tables 4 6 and 9 privileged the xylem sap flow in proximal portions of woody axes near the initial node in a successive construction of nodes those woody proximal regions are older thicker and more costly than distal ones collecting the xylem sap near the initial node and distributing it to sibling axes and distal portions figs 1 7 higher laterality and basitony e g figs 3 and 4 resulted in higher navigability and lowered vulnerability in caatinga it centralizes the distribution of sap flow in those basal portions with more shared nodes between axes these thicker basal woody parts are protected from embolisms according to vulnerability segmentation however it decreases the maximum wcn height figs 3 4 7 and 14 the tallest trees in the studied semiarid caatinga areas were s brasiliensis 7 8 m anandenhanthera macrocarpa benth brenan fabaceae 6 2 m and myracrodruon urundeuva allemão engl anacardiaceae 6 5 m trovão 2004 on the other hand the tallest tree in the cerrado study area was anadenathera falcata with 13 6 m prado measurement with rod bar on august 13 2021 the same species could grow across caatinga physiognomies reducing its size by high basitony and laterality according to the local water stress it may result in bushy or dwarf aspects andrade lima 1981 described the reduced size of mimosa species fabaceae and c pyramidales showing their dwarf condition in shrubby caatinga with shallow soil and high air temperature average 27 c the arborescent crown in coastal dune forests to bushy habit along dry river courses was evident in acacia karoo fabaceae growing in the itala game reserve in south africa archibald and bond 2003 regional and worldwide shreds of evidence support the correlation between decreasing tree or canopy maximum height with less water availability measured by climate aridity medina 1983 givnish et al 2014 fricker et al 2019 in areas with precipitation far exceeding potential evaporation near the equator archibold 2012 trees are higher in a global latitudinal gradient simard et al 2011 moles et al 2009 due to the considerable evapotranspiration between 1500 2000 mm in all areas in caatinga reddy 1983 the total precipitation and soil physical conditions are good predictors of water availability andrade lima 1981 sampaio et al 1981 and sampaio 1995 indicated rainfall soil depth and soil permeability as forecasters of maximum tree size in caatinga the typical caatinga formation shows a not too dense arboreous stratum reaching up to 15 m of height median and low caatinga in areas occurring 800 mm of rainfall per year on soils derived from crystalline rocks at the ends of a spectrum of physiognomies the caatinga community usually reaches 1 0 m tall in areas with 400 mm of rainfall on shallow sandy soils and 25 30 m in areas with 850 1000 mm on more profound eutrophic cambissol andrade lima 1981 the reduction in the size of woody species in regions with low water availability is now well documented holdridge 1967 whittaker 1975 bresinsky et al 2008 besides drought affects more large trees worldwide by decreasing growth and increasing mortality bennette et al 2015 grote et al 2016 ding et al 2017 meakem et al 2018 stoval et al 2019 drought causes a less favorable carbon balance increasing mortality risk o brien et al 2014 doughty et al 2015 however rather than carbon starvation hydraulics triggered tree death under induced drought experiments for 14 years in tropical rainforests principally in large trees with a diameter greater than 40 cm at breast height rowland et al 2015 tree height instead of stem diameter and crown exposure was the best predictor of drought vulnerability inducing mortality in a long term silvicultural experiment in the amazon shenkin et al 2018 the hydraulic architecture in tall trees could be suitable under mild water stress but severe water shortage deteriorates the carbon and water balances leading tall trees to death reduced basitony and laterality support the construction of tall trees figs 3 4 7 and 14 still it results in relatively low navigability and high vulnerability deteriorating the safety of water conducting pathways from initial to final nodes in wcn there are advantages to gaining longitudinal air space for light capturing during successional processes westoby 1998 or under limited light with ample water and nutrient access pretzsch et al 2018 however reduced laterality in tall trees restrains the symmetry and potential topological plasticity ptp fig 14 it hampers the even distribution of navigability and vulnerability in wcn increasing susceptibility to hydraulic failure the remarkable ptp in large wcn of caatinga tree species table 9 and fig 12 could offset some hydraulic constraints of relatively high complexity about cerrado table 9 high ptp handily modulates navigability vulnerability and node sharing between woody axes in different portions of wcn moreover the values of ptp of caatinga about cerrado increased exponentially without stabilization fig 12 resulting in an average value of 6 8 times higher in that semiarid vegetation table 9 cerrado vegetation s physiognomies cerradão cerrado stricto sensu campo cerrado campo sujo and campo limpo also differ by height and woody species density from a closed or semi open canopy reaching 18 m in height in cerradão to open formation with trees 3 m in campo sujo eiten 1972 coutinho 1990 the campo limpo physiognomy is a grassland free of woody species coutinho 1990 the water stress and interactions such as nutrient shortage and fire tailor cerrado physiognomies ribeiro and walter 1998 a gradient of decreasing nutrient availability and aluminum toxicity in cerrado soil usually is associated with a decrease in height and density of woody species from cerradão to campo sujo goodland and pollard 1973 lopes and cox 1977 neri et al 2013 vourlitis et al 2013 abrupt physiognomies transitions under equivalent water stress put nutrient availability and fire regime as significant conditioners across the forest grassland mosaic in the vast area occupied by cerrado vegetation in brazil coutinho 1990 fire affects cerrado woody plants of all sizes reducing the density and mean height and favoring smaller growth forms in burned areas moreira 1992 hoffmann and moreira 2002 lopes et al 2009 interestingly the reduced height 4 0 m of wcn in species of cerrado growing under low water availability on shallow rocky soils ribeiro and walter 1998 some species such as acosmium dasycarpum vogel yakovlev fabaceae which can grow into tall trees in seasonal cerrado areas are found in a dwarfish form in the hyper seasonal cerrado batalha et al 2005 the decreasing woody species density and height observed in caatinga also result from multiple stresses since an excess of radiation and temperature compound the water stress in leaves chaves et al 2003 therefore numerous stresses mediate the ecoclines in caatinga and cerrado but the water shortage is the principal in caatinga in each vegetation the strength of mutual influences of wcn variables about decomposition topology and properties changes according to the type and intensity of stresses fig 14 with four new properties presented here and those four introduced previously by prado et al 2020 the wcn model captures the strategies of the crown to conquest air space here we showed how basitony and laterality tailor the maximum crown height and how these properties are associated with various constraints in caatinga principally water shortage and cerrado multiple stresses vegetations also it was possible to infer the interdependence between the total nodes wcn size hydraulic segmentation and hydraulic vulnerability segmentation comparing caatinga and cerrado trees table 9 or deciduous and evergreen trees in cerrado table 7 the wcn model represents an integrated response fig 14 showing that the blueprinted crown architecture in the genome modulates according to the type dose and interactions of stresses hallé et al 1978 barthélémy et al 1989 hallé 2002 barthélémy and caraglio 2007 hence different projects of wcn genetically determined exposed to equivalent climate and edaphic conditions will keep their distinctions it is the case of functional groups performed by deciduous semideciduous and evergreen tree species coexisting in the same cerrado sensu stricto area damascos et al 2005 souza et al 2009a b souza et al 2011 borges et al 2014 lenti 2014 borges et al 2018 prado et al 2020 higher basitony sharing and potential topological plasticity found in evergreen than deciduous trees table 7 are consistent with their foliage persistence during the winter drought period in the cerrado vegetation area under drought carrying the whole foliage area the evergreen trees demand short distances counted in connectors to cross the wcn for attending the final nodes by xylem mass flow higher sharing values in evergreen than deciduous trees and in caatinga tree species showed their greater construction efficiency of woody axes to pervade air space it is essential in a permanent foliage area subjected to drought in a wcn bearing the highest node population studied in cerrado phenological groups table 7 the more significant node population promotes hydraulic and vulnerability segmentation in evergreen trees furthermore high potential plasticity in evergreen species table 7 supports a more even distribution of their high values of navigability and vulnerability fig 14 we expected a higher maximum height of wcn in deciduous than evergreen tree species growing in the same cerrado sensu stricto physiognomy since basitony was lower in deciduous trees the maximum average size after measurements in at least five adult individuals per species was higher in six deciduous 3 45 1 17 m than in six evergreens 2 89 0 74 m tree species in the studied sensu stricto cerrado physiognomy souza et al 2011 venâncio 2016

values of crown height in four adult deciduous tree species was 5 13 m and in seven adult evergreen tree species was 3 73 m after measurements in 10 individuals per species jardim and batalha 2008 also in the sensu stricto physiognomy reservoir at parque nacional de brasilia in the core area of cerrado vegetation in brazil the median minimum and maximum values of crown height in 156 measured individual trees lenti 2014 were higher in ten deciduous species 3 9 1 9 and 5 7 m than in 5 evergreens species 3 6 1 7 and 5 6 m the usefulness of the wcn model will improve in association with automatized laser woody crown reconstruction åkerblom et al 2018 hackenberg et al 2015 raumonen et al 2013 monitoring the vulnerability of individuals populations and communities with limited development caused by severe stress the summary of our model in a flowchart presented in fig 14 improves our hydraulic understanding at the crown s level explains the mosaic of physiognomies in each vegetation and facilitates the identification of functional groups of woody species 5 conclusions we showed how combinations of woody axes decomposition and topology could modulate the architecture s blueprint the eight entangle properties presented here captured these combinations high basitony laterality and intense node addition protect woody species against hydraulic failure by decreasing vulnerability and increasing navigability in wcn inherently reducing the maximum crown height it shapes the individual crown and woody community contributing to tailoring each physiognomy or functional group in every vegetation our model accommodates the hydraulic and vulnerability segmentation into the whole wcn explaining why tall trees are more vulnerable to hydraulic failure and how such individuals became reduced bushy or eventually adopted dwarf format under severe stresses credit authorship contribution statement carlos henrique britto de assis prado conceptualization
