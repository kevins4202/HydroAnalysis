20260,previous experiments on the fouling current and fouling wave interactions were mostly limited to two dimensional 2d net panels or isolated twines the current paper deals with the wave induced forces moments in three dimensional 3d physical models of a gravity net cage the colonial hydroid ectopleura larynx a common fouling organism in the aquaculture industry was artificially modelled and considered in the current experiments a clean cage and cages with different fouling lengths were tested under deep water regular wave trains the time series of the wave induced forces moments in the surge sway roll and pitch degrees of freedom were recorded and analysed the experimental results showed that the surge force amplitude increased up to 72 by the fouling but the sway force amplitude decreased up to 26 the asymmetry of the surge and sway force waveforms increased by the fouling respectively the effects of the fouling on the force moment response amplitude operators rao were also studied pixel histogram analysis was performed to define equivalent net solidities of the fouled nets in general the tests under regular waves were found to underestimate the soft fouling effects on the wave induced forces moments as compared to those carried out under irregular waves keywords marine fouling regular waves laboratory experiments aquaculture cage surge sway forces pixel histogram analysis 1 introduction marine aquaculture plays an important role in seafood production which is expected to expand rapidly to meet the increasing demands straume et al 2020 they are however progressively forced offshore because of space limitation and pollution caused by seizure navigation and other man made activities offshore waves provide a high rate water exchange in the net cage which effectively benefits the health and growth of the fish and the products quality strong offshore waves and currents however may induce large forces deformations to the fishing net reduce the effective volume and negatively affect the health of the fish in order to ensure the structural integrity of an offshore net cage it is imperative to have proper insight into the hydrodynamic response and forces induced by energetic offshore waves a number of previous researchers experimentally and or numerically addressed the forces induced by irregular waves on net panels gravity net cages submersible net cages and floating collars extra relevant studies were listed in dong et al 2010 li et al 2013a and zhao et al 2010 colbourne and allen 2001 reported their field observations experimental model and numerical simulation results on motions and forces created by regular and irregular waves in aquaculture cages song et al 2006 experimentally investigated the horizontal forces from the regular waves in net panels and provided a calculation method lader et al 2007a experimentally and numerically investigated the interaction of regular waves with plane nets of different solidities zhao et al 2008 experimentally and numerically investigated the inertia and drag forces created by regular waves on plane nets wu et al 2008 experimentally and numerically studied the hydrodynamic force coefficients in a floating gravity net cage under different regular wave trains kristiansen 2010 numerically investigated the forces induced by regular waves in the floating collars of aquaculture cages xu et al 2012 numerically investigated the hydrodynamic response of multiple net cages in regular waves li et al 2013b numerically investigated the dynamic response of a floating fish cage under regular waves and current grue 2014 experimentally and numerically studied the current wave induced loads in the mooring lines of a conventional gravity net cage kristiansen et al 2015 experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic forces and the dynamics of a gravity net cage scaled model under waves and current kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 experimentally and numerically evaluated the mooring loads in an aquaculture net cage under wave current actions huang et al 2016 numerically studied the wave induced forces and deformations in a floating collar chen and christensen 2018 presented a numerical model for simulating current and wave interaction with a floater net system dong et al 2019 used experimental modelling to investigate the hydrodynamic forces on different types of net panels in waves the effects of the net solidity the net material and the knots pattern were examined bi et al 2020b provided an artificial neural network ann model to predict the structural failure of hdpe high density poly ethylene net cages in typhoon waves on the other hand underwater surface of man made structures is quickly covered by aquatic organisms called marine fouling which is defined as undesirable accumulation of biological organisms such as bacteria algae plant and animal colonies on artificial surfaces immersed in seawater hellio and yebra 2009 marine fouling constitutes serious problems in the aquaculture industry as it negatively affects the mariculture operation and the structural integrity it considerably increases the weight of the structure and culture equipment threatens the stability of suspended culture systems reduces the lifespan of the mooring lines decreases the flow exchange across the nets affects the water quality within the enclosures and threatens the fish health lader et al 2015 in particular marine fouling changes the flow regime around the structure and the hydrodynamic forces induced to the cage even though such negative impacts are acknowledged by the research community and governmental bodies there is still limited knowledge about fouling related effects on the fish cage hydrodynamics extra detailed studies have been called for to get insights to effects of different fouling types on the hydrodynamic response of cage systems under waves and current actions gansel et al 2015 there are handful researches dealing with the marine fouling effects on the current wave induced forces in aquaculture fish cages swift et al 2006 experimentally studied increase in the drag force due to marine fouling on a plane net the drag force was measured at different tow speeds for live marine fouling gansel et al 2015 investigated marine fouling effects on the current induced forces on plane nets towing tank tests were conducted on clean and fouled nets lader et al 2015 investigated the current induced drag forces in marine fouled nets covered with artificial hydroid ectopleura larynx towing tank tests at various speeds were conducted to investigate the drag force on the fouled twines the wave propagating through a square array of marine fouled net cages was numerically investigated by bi et al 2017 using cfd modelling the wave height inside and around the net cage arrays was also measured and analysed bi et al 2018 conducted laboratory model testing and numerical simulation of the hydroid fouling effects on the current induced drag force and flow through the plane nets the hydrodynamic load on the biofouled plane nets reportedly increased up to 10 times as compared to that in the clean net bi et al 2020a experimentally studied the hydroids effects on the wave induced force and motion responses in plane nets they noticed that with the most severely biofouled net the maximum horizontal motion amplitude was 3 84 times of that in the clean net nobakht kolur et al 2021a experimentally investigated the hydraulic responses of the clean and artificially fouled 3d net cages under regular wave trains they noticed that attenuation of the wave height and energy downstream of the cage models were increased by the fouling presence and length nobakht kolur et al 2021b experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic responses of the clean and marine fouled net cages under irregular waves the results showed that the surge force amplitude increased up to 160 by the fouling they indicated that the sway force amplitude decreased up to 50 by the fouling the aforementioned review of the literature implies that despite the important contributions of previous studies effects of marine fouling on the wave induced forces to aquaculture net cages have not received due attentions the works on the wave induced forces in marine fouled net cages were mostly limited to 2d net panels or isolated twines the current paper reports the results of the experimental studies addressing the marine fouling effects on the wave induced forces in 3d models of the gravity net cages the cage models included one clean cage and two fouled cages of different fouling lengths the colonial hydroid ectopleura larynx was artificially modelled and considered in the current experiments time series of the in line surge and cross line sway forces as well as the pitch and roll moments generated by regular waves in the clean and fouled fish cage models were obtained and analysed the main purpose was to investigate how the wave induced forces were affected by the presence of the fouling and by the fouling density length the wave forces reported in the current study also include those received by the collars the floating collar may receive a good part of the wave force because the water particle velocities accelerations are comparatively high around the mean water surface level the contribution of floating collar due to wave force to the total force in clean cage models was reported to be around 28 kristiansen 2010 this percentage noticeably decreases in a marine fouled cage previous studies conducted on marine fouled planar nets showed an up to 3 88 times increase in the wave force due to the fouling presence on the net bi et al 2020a 2 materials and methods 2 1 the fish cage model the cage model used in the current experiments features a1 80 scale of an existing gravity fish cage operating in offshore waters the froude similarity law was applied for the scaling of the physical model and the wave regime the geometric mechanical specifications of the scaled net cage model used in the current experiments are presented in table 1 the floating collar in the prototype cage comprised two concentric buoyant tubular rings made of hdpe pipes two small diameter ldpe low density poly ethylene pipes were separately wrapped into circles and their ends were then girth welded the two rings were interconnected using equally spaced radial brackets to form a collar consisting of two concentric buoyant rings the dimensions of the floating collar and the brackets observed the scaling ratio but satisfying the scaling rules for the collar bending stiffness was not viable the bending stiffness ei of the full scale floating hdpe collar was about 670 kn m2 where e is the young s modulus of the material and i is the second area moment of the collar cross section the bending stiffness of the floating collar in 1 80 scale would be ei 80 5 or about 2 0 10 4n m2 which was too small the ldpe pipes used in the current study for the floating collar tube had a bending stiffness of 6 4 10 3 n m2 n m2 this implies that the bending stiffness of the floating collar in the present model was around 32 times stiffer than that of an ideally scaled collar elastic deformations of the collar in the present cage models were therefore expected to remain small as compared to those in an ideally scaled collar the waves in the current study were properly scaled to the design waves in the prototype cage meaning that the floating collar in the prototype net cage would experience higher bending deformations as compared to that in the current experiment see fig 6 it is reiterated that the focus of the current paper is on the overall wave loads induced to the wave cage effects of the collar stiffness on overall wave actions were reportedly insignificant xu et al 2013 a small diameter ldpe pipe was also wrapped to circle to form the sinker collar a steel wire was inserted in the sinker collar to provide the target weight in the model several holes were drilled in the ldpe pipe to assist the collar sinking during the installation of the cage model please see the zoomed area in fig 1 polyester pes nets were used to model the cylindrical suspended net chamber the net had a compressed texture and it was manufactured according to norwegian standard ns 9415 2009 by toorbafan company the net had a twine diameter of d 2 8 mm a square mesh size of l 20 mm and a solidity of s n 0 26 fig 2 the net solidity of the clean net was estimated using the mathematical formulation of s n 2 d l d l 2 the net cage model was bottomless to reduce the complexity of the wave cage interactions the twine diameter the mesh size the mesh solidity and the material properties of the netting in the physical modelling remained nearly the same as those in the full scale cage this implies that the geometric mechanical scaling was not also held for the netting reportedly satisfying both the reynolds number and the net size solidity similitude in the model and in full scale cages is unviable kristiansen et al 2015 kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 xu et al 2013 the twines would have turned considerably thin if the 1 80 scaling was applied resulting in very low reynolds numbers in the model than those in the full scale this was causing a great difference in the model hydrodynamics as compared to that in the full scale kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 the proportion of the reynolds dependent frictional viscous drag force to the pressure form drag force in the physical model and the prototype would also differ with scaling of the twines dimensions palczynski 2000 the reynolds numbers were calculated based on the h and t values in the full scale and model scale table 3 the reynolds numbers at water surface elevation were in range of 440 to 760 and 3 900 to 6 800 at the model scale and at full scale respectively the ratio of the reynolds numbers of the full and model scales was thus around 9 the scaled model of floating hdpe circular fish cage with the clean net is presented in fig 1 a spread mooring system was used for position keeping of the net cage model it comprised four taut mooring lines l1 to l4 four v bridles were interconnecting the lines to the floating collar fig 3 b they allowed for distribution of the mooring lines reactions round the collar the upstream and downstream mooring lines l1 and l2 stayed in the wave direction and the port and starboard mooring lines l3 and l4 remained perpendicular to the wave direction fig 3 b the mooring lines were made of nylon ropes of 1 mm diameter density of 1 120 kg m3 and the tensile stiffness of around 240 n m the ending part of each mooring line l1 to l4 was fixed to a hang over support fig 3 c at the static initial condition the mooring lines had an angle of 2 4 to zero water level 2 2 the marine fouling model the colonial hydroid ectopleura larynx is a problematic fouling organism frequently found on aquaculture installations blöcher 2013 braithwaite and mcevoy 2004 guenther et al 2011 lader et al 2015 this type of soft marine fouling was considered in the current study live ectopleura larynx hydroids experience high death rates in laboratory experiments in freshwaters which will changes their hydraulic behaviour from hydroids in sea waters lader et al 2015 to reach the nearest behaviour to reality for this organism in the laboratory lader et al 2015 modelled artificial hydroid ectopleura larynx using nylon threads they also conducted field measurements on the growth of the ectopleura larynx to find the characteristics of the organism for modelling the lader et al 2015 approach with some adjustments was employed in the current laboratory modelling of the marine fouling the differences are as follows in the current study the fouling effects on the wave induced forces in the fish cage models were investigated but they studied the current induced forces in the lader study one two and four fouled twines with different arrangements and plane nets were studied in the current study the fouling was modelled on the whole 3d net cage in their study the smallest length of an organism was 6 4 mm the present study considers two uniform arrangements of soft fouling 6 mm and 20 mm long the study can be enriched by examining uniform soft fouling of lengths in between 6 and 20 mm and aggregation of fouling of varying lengths on a single net which will be considered as part of future studies on the subject in their study the organism head was also modelled but in the current study the heads were not modelled three net types were used in the current experiments they included one clean net without marine fouling and two fouled nets with fouling lengths of 6 mm and 20 mm all fouling treads had constant thickness and were uniformly distributed over entire twines length at a constant density the physical characteristics of the fouling used in the current experiments are listed in table 2 views of different net types are presented in fig 2 2 3 the wave properties all tests were carried out in the national iranian marine laboratory nimala tehran iran it is a member of the international towing tank conference ittc the flume is 402 m long 6 m wide and 4 5 m deep fig 3 a the tests were carried out at constant water depth of 3 98 m which allowed modelling of deep offshore waves the piston type wavemaker can produce both regular and irregular waves wave absorbers at the flume end were mitigating the wave reflection the wave iee software provided by flume designer company was used for data acquisition synchronization of the sensors and signals and post processing analysis of the outputs each cage model was examined under 8 regular wave cases see table 3 the wave cases were selected based on the wave flume limitations and scaling of sample sea states at the prototype cage site kristiansen et al 2015 and the extreme degree of exposure as per norwegian aquaculture site classification scheme klebert et al 2015 provided in table 4 the wavelengths were estimated using the dispersion equation and all wave cases were meeting the deep water conditions three wave cases had a constant steepness but their wave heights and periods varied wave cases 1 5 and 8 three wave cases had the same wave height but with different periods and steepness wave cases 5 6 and 7 three wave cases had the same periods but with different wave heights and steepness wave cases 3 6 and 8 for each individual wave case a wave train with 100 cycles in steady state duration was exposed to the cage models the fresh water in the flume had a mean density of 1 001 0 kg m3 the water temperature was monitored over the course of the experiments the temperature effect on the water density similar to that in zeinoddini et al 2014 and bakhtiari et al 2020 was estimated using faltinsen 1993 recommendations and remained below 0 05 to ensure the repeatability of the devices and the measuring system wave cases 5 to 8 were each repeated twice the maximum differences in the measured surge and sway mean peak to peak force amplitude were 2 5 and 2 respectively a waiting time of 20 min was considered between the consequent tests to achieve a calm water condition ersdal 2004 a number of tests were also repeated in the absence of the cage to verify the performance of the wave flume and the measuring instruments under storm conditions extreme waves and currents concurrently act on a floating cage depending on the offshore site condition and the proximity of the wave frequency to the natural frequency of the floating cage the current or wave forces might dominate regardless of waves or currents dominance their concurrent effects have to be considered in the design of a floating structure the present study only deals with the wave forces in marine fouled cages the current induced force on the marine fouled panels and cages was addressed by previous researchers e g bi et al 2018 lader et al 2015 combined current wave actions in a marine fouled floating cage can be considered as part of future studies on the subject 2 4 instrumentation time series of the water surface elevation was measured using six wave gauges arranged upstream downstream and at the centre axis of the cage see fig 3 b the data from the wave tests conducted in the presence and absence of a physical model were used to evaluate and calibrate the incident wave conditions a sample time series of the incident wave case 2 the steepest wave in table 3 t 0 8 s h 55 mm and s 0 055 is provided in fig 4 the figure characterises a regular wave whose height is close to 55 mm with minor inevitable variations the corresponding wave energy spectrum can be found in fig 9 a which shows that the water surface oscillation was regular and occurred at a frequency of 1 25 hz t 0 8 s the sampling rate in the wave gauges was 100 hz the standard linear displacement method was used for the wave gauges calibration wherein the relative water level at each gauge was changed at known intervals the relative water level data was correlated against the measured voltages the accuracy of wave gauges was 0 4 mm and the coefficient of variation was 0 35 four cameras were synchronized together to collect images from the cage movements during the test the frame rate was set to 15 hz time series of the forces induced by regular waves passing through the clean and fouled fish cage models were measured using load cells fixed at far end of each mooring line afore the fixed support fig 3 b c the pretension in the mooring lines of the three net cage models was set at 6 0 1n the load cells were particularly designed and fabricated for the current experiments each load cell included a cantilever steel leaf spring strain gauges were positioned on two sides of the leaf spring to form a wheatstone full bridge circuit the load cell had a resolution of 0 01n and the sampling rate was 100 hz prior to each test series the load cells were calibrated using loads applied by known weights the load cells found to remain linear non hysteresis and to present reasonably constant calibration coefficients all over the experiments 2 5 data processing method 2 5 1 the wave induced force moment data the wave induced force moment time series were related using below equations to the load cells data the in line surge force 1 f surge t f 1 t f 2 t cos θ the cross line sway force 2 f sway t f 3 t f 4 t cos θ the pitch moment 3 m pitch t r f 1 t f 2 t sin θ the roll moment 4 m roll t r f 3 t f 4 t sin θ where t is the time f surge t is the surge force in line to the wave travel direction f sway t is the sway force cross line to the wave travel direction m pitch t is the pitch moment at the cage centre m roll t is the roll moment at the cage centre r is the moment arm or the horizontal distance of the load cell from the cage centre 1 45 m f 1 t and f 2 t represent the wave induced forces in the upstream and downstream mooring lines respectively f 3 t and f 4 t represent the wave induced forces in the port and starboard mooring lines fig 3 b respectively and θ is the angle of the mooring lines to the mean water level it is noted that all load cells placed on the mooring lines l1 to l4 were unidirectional they were set to zero prior to each wave test thus were just reflecting the wave induced forces in a direction from the load cell position towards the cage centre fig 3 b c sample time series of the water surface elevation surge force sway force pitch moment and roll moment are presented in fig 5 they corresponded to model testing of the clean net cage under wave case 7 with h 80 mm and t 1 3 s for each model test the steady state portion of the signal which included around 100 wave force moment cycles was selected for data analysis the steady state portion was assumed to start after about 10 wave force moment cycles past the wave arrival below assumptions and approximations were made when deriving eqs 1 4 the mooring lines dynamics were neglected this can be justified by the lines low mass compared with the mass and added mass of the cage model a fixed value of θ 2 4 which represents the θ at pre test conditions see fig 3 c was used in eqs 1 4 in practice θ did not remain constant due to the wave induced pitch and roll motions of the floating collar images provided by the cine cameras monitoring the model tests indicated that the maximum variation range of θ was around 1 5 in lines l1 and l2 and 1 in lines l3 and l4 these appeared in the clean cage under wave case no 8 h 95 mm t 1 1 s the corresponding variation range in the surge and in the sway forces was estimated to be around 0 15 to 0 09 and around 0 09 to 0 06 respectively eq 1 ignores contributions of l3 and l4 lines when calculating the wave induced surge force eq 2 ignores contributions of l1 and l2 lines when calculating the wave induced sway force images taken by a high resolution cine camera installed atop of the cage models were used to assess the resulting errors maximum surge and sway motions over a total number of 24 test cases were noticed to occur in the clean cage under wave case 8 h 95 mm t 1 1 s fig 6 provides the corresponding images of the collar conditions before the wave arrival at maximum surge motion and at maximum sway motion the figure indicates that at maximum surge motion the horizontal offset of the collar centre was around 22 mm considering a pretension of 6 n in the mooring lines the contribution of l3 and l4 lines to the surge force at this extreme condition would be around 0 18 n the concurrent surge force provided by eq 1 was 3 04 n this yields to an error of around 5 6 in maximum surge force calculation the corresponding error for the sway forces was around 12 it is noted that the errors estimated reflect the two most extreme cage motions and expectedly grow lower at smaller cage offsets 2 5 2 amplitude definitions the force moment time series were separately analysed using a zero crossing method the interval between an up and the next down zero crossings was defined as one half cycle the signal amplitude was defined as half distance from the positive peak in a half cycle and the negative peak in the next half cycle ½p2p this was called force amplitude f a p2p or moment amplitude m a p2p from the p2p method the signal amplitude was also defined as 2 times rms root mean squared value of the data points in each half cycle this was called force amplitude f a rms or moment amplitude m a rms from the rms method in fact in a perfectly sinusoidal signal the amplitudes computed using the two methods would be the same the mean drift force moment f d or m d caused by the second order wave potential effects was defined as the mean value of the corresponding signal over the steady state portion 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall variation trends of the wave induced forces moments sample time series of the wave induced surge and sway forces in the clean and two fouled cages under wave case no 8 h 95 mm and t 1 1 s are presented in fig 7 the concurrent time series of the water surface elevation at the centre of the cage wave gauge no 4 is also provided in the figure the abscissa in fig 7 illustrates the time t normalised by the wave period t fig 7 a indicates that at the cage centre the wave height was noticeably greater than that of the incident wave h 95 mm presumably due to a wave energy build up inside the cage table 5 compares the incident wave height and the wave height measured at the centre of the clean and two marine fouled cages with all test cases a wave height build up appeared at the centre of the cage relative to that for the incident wave a higher wave build up occurred inside the clean cage as compared to those inside the fouled cages fig 7 b shows that the surge force was almost in phase with the water surface elevation at the centre point of the cage the sway force fig 7 c however kept a phase lag of around t t 0 25 relevant to the surge force and the water surface elevation profile fig 7 b c show that the force amplitude in surge was notably higher than that in sway the surge force amplitude was increased by the fouling presence and further by the fouling length it turned the opposite with the sway force the front crest slope in the fouled cages was slightly steeper than the corresponding rear crest slope see marks a b and c in fig 7 the difference increased by the fouling length the positive amplitudes pos ampl in the surge force time series were greater than the corresponding negative amplitudes neg amp indicating on presence of a mean drift force the pos ampl and neg amp however almost equalled in the time series of the sway force and the water surface elevation the force profiles in fig 7 b c contained higher harmonics manifesting themselves as small surplus fluctuations around a main harmonic the period of the main harmonic was reasonably close to that for the incident wave t 1 1 s the higher harmonics were partly reflecting nonlinearities in the wave to force interactions wave overtopping effects and the cage dynamics and were more evident around the troughs and crests a marks in fig 7 b c fig 7 shows that a mean wave drift force f d was present in all wave cases tested however the ratio of the surge drift force to the surge force amplitude f d f a p2p was not high the f d f a p2p ratio of the surge force in the clean cage ranged from 5 to 19 with a mean value of 11 the mean f d f a p2p ratio of the surge force in both fouled cages was 9 it is noted that the water surface elevation data at the centre of the clean and two fouled cages fig 7 a were obtained from separate tests at different times thus they are not concurrent for ease of comparison the water surface elevation curves of in fig 7 a were manually aligned to show almost concurrent peaks and troughs in the three cages with each cage model however the data for the water surface elevation fig 7 a the surge force fig 7 b and the sway force fig 7 c are concurrent fig 8 compares as an example the f a p2p f a rms and f d of the surge force in the clean net against the wave case number the figure shows that the force amplitudes obtained from p2p and rms methods differed but were relatively close fig 9 compares the f a p2p f a rms ratios for the surge and sway forces and the m a p2p m a rms ratios for the roll and pitch moments the amplitude ratios from the two models stayed close but below unity meaning that the force moment responses were not quite sinusoidal the regularity of the force moment responses was slightly improved by the fouling presence and the fouling length the error bars show that the f a p2p f a rms and m a p2p m a rms ratios did not vary significantly among different wave cases because the force moment amplitudes obtained from the p2p and rms methods were relatively close hereafter only the force moment amplitudes obtained from the p2p method will be presented to avoid duplication of information 3 2 the power spectral densities psds the psds of the wave profiles and the wave induced forces moments were computed using their corresponding time series as an example the psd of the water surface elevation for incident wave case 2 t 0 8 s h 55 mm and s 0 055 is presented in fig 10 a it is noted that wave case 2 was the steepest wave used in the current experiments fig 10 b c provide psds of the surge and sway forces respectively in the clean cage model under wave case 2 the ordinate of all psds in the figure were normalised by their maximum power the psds of the water surface elevation as well as the surge and sway forces in fig 10 exhibit a dominant peak around 1 25 hz or the frequency of the incident regular wave case 2 the figure implies that in general the wave data and the force responses were fairly regular a magnified psd was also provided in each plot of fig 10 the inserts reveal smaller psd peaks at frequencies 2 and 3 times of the frequency of the main harmonic in the wave and in the force signals this implies that small amplitude high order harmonics were also present in the wave profile the high order harmonics appeared to have become stronger in the force signals 3 3 the response amplitude operators in the current study the response amplitude operator rao is used as a linear transfer function to relate the wave induced force moment amplitude to the wave amplitude as an example the surge force and sway force raos for the clean cage model are presented in fig 11 the overall trends in the surge and sway force raos were relatively similar however the surge force rao stayed notably higher than that in sway the ratio of the sway surge raos varied from around 0 22 to 0 48 depending on the wave case almost all rao plots in fig 11 peaked at frequencies around 0 9 hz as aforementioned three wave cases 3 6 and 8 had similar wave periods t 1 1 s but different wave heights therefore three different data points for the raos were provided at this frequency the surge force raos in fig 11 had a mean value of 31 2 n m a standard deviation of 4 9 n m and a coefficient of variation cov of 0 157 the sway force raos had a mean value of 13 3 n m a standard deviation of 1 3 n m and a cov of 0 097 the sway force raos therefore were less scattered compared to the surge force raos the surge and sway force raos both grew smaller by increasing frequency possibly due to higher wave cancelation of short length waves it is noted that the response amplitude operator rao assumes a linear relationship between the response and the wave amplitude of a floating structure therefore at least theoretically waves of different heights can be used to obtain the relationship between rao and frequency on the other hand floating structures do not usually act as linear wave structure systems because terms such as the wave second order interactions high waves asymmetry the mooring system nonlinearity viscous components of the fluid flow wave overtopping wave slamming the wet and dry condition changes near the water surface dependency of the hydrodynamic mass and damping force coefficients to the response amplitude quadratic drag force terms and large deformations of the soft fouling nonlinearly affect the global response of a floating structure in waves despite these limitations the frequency domain approach and raos are frequently employed in the design and dynamic analysis of floating structures because they provide valuable information on the force and motion responses of the structure fredriksson et al 2003a 2003b o donnell et al 2021 in addition the wave height data are also included in fig 11 and later in fig 15 to demonstrate the extent of nonlinearities caused by the wave height on the rao values and on the wave horizontal asymmetry factor μ this might justify a linear assumption for the wave height wave load mechanism in the cage models for this reason in fig 12 the mean rao from the wave cases 3 6 and 8 is provided at t 1 1 s fig 12 a presents the surge force raos in the clean and the two fouled cage models against the wave frequencies tested the rao values increased by the fouling presence which can be ascribed to the increase in the projected area of the twines as well as increase in the net solidity of the fouled cages the surge force rao grew slightly higher by increase in the fouling length the fouling effect on the surge force rao ranged from 13 to 72 the effects were intensified by increase in the wavelength and by the wave height e g compare wave cases 1 to 8 fig 12 b depicts the sway force raos against the wave frequency unlike the surge forces the rao values in sway decreased by the fouling presence and furthermore by the fouling length this could be stemmed from the fact that the fouling reduced the size thus the power of the eddies formed past the fish cage similar observations were reported for the vortex induced vibrations of fouled cylinders tested in uniform current zeinoddini et al 2016a 2016b 2018 jadidi et al 2018 jadidi and zeinoddini 2020 the fouling effect on the sway force rao ranged from 3 to 26 the effects were intensified as the wavelength or the wave height increased on the whole the rao trends in the clean and fouled cages remained fairly similar fig 12 c presents the roll moment rao against the wave frequency similar to that with the sway force rao the roll moment rao values decreased by the presence of the fouling and furthermore by the fouling length the reasons were like as those described for sway force raos fig 12 d depicts the pitch moment rao against the wave frequencies examined on the whole the variation trends in the pitch raos remained similar in the clean and fouled cages the pitch moment rao values however were increased by the fouling presence the reasons were like as those described for the surge force raos 3 4 wave parameters effects here the effects of variations in the wave period height and steepness on the wave induced forces moments are discussed to evaluate the influence of the wave period three wave cases of constant heights but varying wave periods were selected the p2p amplitude of the surge sway forces and roll pitch moments in the clean and the two fouled cage models are presented in fig 13 fig 13 a shows that the surge force amplitude slightly decreased by increase in the wave period this was true both in the clean and in the fouled cages in fact as per airy wave theory the water particle velocities accelerations thus the amplitudes of the drag inertia forces are inversely proportional to the wave period see eq 8 fig 13 a shows that the amplitude of the wave induced surge force was increased by the fouling presence and further by the fouling length a similar trend could be noticed with the pitch moment amplitude fig 13 d fig 13 b c show that on the contrary the sway force amplitude and the roll moment amplitude were decreased by the fouling presence the fouling length made almost no difference to the sway force amplitude three wave cases of constant periods but varying heights were selected to evaluate the wave height effects on the wave induced forces moments the corresponding p2p amplitudes of the surge sway forces and roll pitch moments in the clean and the two fouled cage models are presented in fig 14 the surge sway force amplitude and the roll pitch moment amplitude all increased by the wave height the wave induced force amplitude in the collar and in individual twines are tentatively proportional to the power 2 of the water particle velocity say power 2 of the wave height see eq 8 the force moment amplitudes in the clean and fouled cage models however varied almost linearly by the wave height fig 14 this can be ascribed to the time lags existed between the peak wave force in different twines and across the collar the lag magnitude was dependent to the orientation spacing of the twines relative to the wave crest the time lags cause partial force moment cancellation between the twines thus the overall cage force might no longer remain proportional to the power two of the wave height fig 14 shows that the amplitude of the surge force and the pitch moment increased and the amplitude of the sway force and roll moment decreased by the fouling presence the fouling length had small effects on the amplitude of the sway force and roll moment three wave cases of small steepness case 4 h l 0 023 moderate steepness case 6 h l 0 042 and high steepness case 2 h l 0 055 were selected to evaluate the wave steepness effects on the wave induced forces moments the corresponding p2p amplitudes of the surge sway forces and roll pitch moments in the clean and the two fouled cage models are presented in fig 15 the figure shows that in all cases the wave induced force moment amplitudes increased from small steepness to the moderate steepness then decreased for the steepest wave from the smallest towards the moderate steepness the wave height increased from 70 to 80 mm and the wave period decreases from 1 4 to 1 1 s accordingly the amplitudes of the water particle velocity acceleration say the amplitudes of the wave induced force moment increased from the moderate steepness towards the steepest wave case the wave height decreases from 80 to 55 mm 31 and the wave period decreases from 1 1 to 0 8 s 27 as a result the amplitudes of the water particle velocity acceleration and the wave induced force moment decreased the steepness effects on the force moment amplitudes in the two fouled cage models in fig 15 were well comparable to those in the clean cage model however in all cases at high steepness the differences between the force moment amplitudes in the clean and the fouled cages grew small 3 5 asymmetry features the current test results showed that the positive and negative amplitudes differed almost in all force moment waveforms this could be attributed to i possible asymmetry in the wave profile ii the wave drift force effects iii the hydraulic response of the cage to the passing wave iv the inherent depth dependence of the water particle velocity acceleration in the wave field asymmetries in the wave induced surge force were also noticed by lader et al 2007b in laboratory measurements of forces on three different 2d planar net panels exposed to five different regular wave cases they reported that the positive amplitude was larger than the negative amplitude in the current study the horizontal asymmetry factor μ of the force moment and water surface elevation time series was described as follows lader et al 2007b 5 μ pos amp pos amp neg amp where pos amp is the mean positive amplitudes over the steady part of the time series and neg amp is the corresponding mean negative amplitude it is noted that the asymmetry factors reported hereafter do not include the drift force effects because when calculating μ the drift force was subtracted from the force moments time series fig 16 presents μ values of the wave profile at the centre axis of the cage against the wave steepness s the figure shows that with all net cages wave cases μ for the wave profile remained very close to μ value in a linear sinusoidal wave μ 0 5 the figure also indicates that in the fouled cages μ moved closer to the μ 0 5 line figs 17 and 18 provide the μ values of the surge and sway waveforms respectively in the clean and the two fouled cage models the μ values in figs 17 and 18 are grouped once against the wave period and once against the wave steepness the data in the former belonged to wave cases of 1 5 and 8 with constant wave steepness of s 0 051 but varying wave periods the data with the latter belonged to wave cases of small steepness case 4 s 0 023 moderate steepness case 6 s 0 042 and high steepness case 2 s 0 055 fig 17 shows that all μ values of surge force were greater than 0 5 meaning that the mean positive amplitude was greater than the mean negative amplitude the surge force asymmetry might be explained by regular wave theories which suggest that the maximum velocity at the wave crest is larger than the maximum velocity at the wave trough moreover under the wave crest the exposed area of the cage model grew larger than that under the wave trough fig 17 shows that the asymmetry of the surge force waveforms increased by the fouling presence and most often by the fouling length with the sway force the μ values remained greater than 0 5 in the cage with 20 mm fouling fig 18 for a majority of cases μ in the cage with 6 mm fouling remained greater than 0 5 no discernible correlation could be drawn in fig 18 between the μ values and the wave period t or the steepness s of the regular waves 3 6 quantifying the fouling effects 3 6 1 fouling effects on the force moment amplitude to quantify the fouling effects on the wave induced force amplitude below parameter ψ was defined 6 ψ f a f f a c or m a f m a c where f a f and m a f are the p2p force and moment amplitude in a fouled cage respectively and f a c and m a c are the p2p force and moment amplitude in the clean cage respectively as an example fig 19 a b depict ψ in surge and sway respectively against the wave height h the figure shows that ψ in surge stayed apparently above unity this turned the opposite in sway with the surge force ψ max 1 72 ψ mean 1 44 and ψ min 1 32 in the cage of 20 mm long fouling and ψ max 1 35 ψ mean 1 20 and ψ min 1 13 in the cage of 6 mm long fouling fig 19 a indicates that ψ in surge increased notably by the fouling length but it didn t show an apparent ascending or descending trend by the wave height in overall f a f in surge was between 13 and 72 higher than f a c depending on the fouling length and wave characteristics the f a f increase was partly attributed to the increase caused by the fouling to the net solidity and to the wave interaction areas unlike hard fouling soft fouling swing in waves the net and the fouling dynamics are essentially different this can cause significant build up in relative velocities accelerations thus in the wave induced drag and inertia forces in sway ψ was smaller than unity fig 19 b this stemmed mostly from the fact that the fouling was suppressing the wave induced motions the physics of the cross flow force in a cage subject to irregular waves apparently differs from that of the vortex induced vibration viv phenomena in cylindrical bodies however the amplitude of the cross flow force in cylinders covered by artificial marine fouling also reportedly decreases by the fouling presence zeinoddini et al 2016a 2016b 2017 2018 jadidi et al 2018 for the sway force in the cage with 20 mm long fouling ψ max 0 93 ψ mean 0 85 and ψ min 0 74 for the sway force in the cage model with 6 mm long fouling ψ max 0 97 ψ mean 0 88 and ψ min 0 79 therefore f a f in sway was between 3 and 26 smaller than f a c depending on the fouling length and wave characteristics for the sway force ψ in the cages with 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling demonstrated similar trends against the wave height but in general ψ moderately decreased by the fouling length 3 6 2 the net solidity and drag force coefficients in marine aquaculture cages the design wave height ratio to the diameter of the net twins h d is typically high the drag component therefore dominates the surge force induced by the wave to the net cage and the inertia component may be ignored zhao et al 2008 based on laboratory experiments on clean nets of varying solidity some previous researchers suggested formulations between the drag force coefficient c d and the net solidity s n for example dong et al 2019 proposed below empirical c d formula in plane nylon nets 7 c d 2 7 2 5 d ℓ 1 3 13 s n kc 3 1 5 kc u m t d where d is the twine s diameter ℓ is the mesh bar length kc is the keulegan carpenter number u m is the maximum water particle velocity and t is the wave period the solidity of a clean net can be defined as s n c 2 d l d l 2 no mathematical definition is currently available for the solidity of marine fouled nets s n f firstly due to unpredictability of the size features configuration of the organisms and secondly because soft organisms do not remain stationary and swing in the wave current regimes it is assumed here that eq 7 can also be applied to marine fouled nets provided that an equivalent solidity is defined for the fouled net ignoring the inertia component the amplitude of the surge force induced by a linear deep water regular wave of height h and period t to a square ℓ ℓ element in the clean net fig 20 a can be approximated as morison et al 1950 8 f c 1 2 t 2 ρ c d c s n c ℓ 2 π 2 h 2 ⅇ 2 k z where f c is the amplitude of the wave force induced to the square element of the clean net s n c is the clean net solidity k is the wave number ρ is the water density z is the water depth at centre of the square element and c d c is the drag coefficient in the clean net which is defined using eq 7 the same square element in the net is now assumed to be covered by the marine fouling fig 20 b the amplitude of the surge force induced by a linear deep water wave of height h and period t to the square element in the fouled net can be expressed as 9 f f 1 2 t 2 ρ c d f s n f ℓ 2 π 2 h 2 ⅇ 2 k z where f f is the amplitude of the wave force induced to the fouled net s n f is the equivalent solidity of the fouled net and c d f is the drag coefficient in the fouled net from eqs 8 and 9 the ratio of the amplitudes of the surge force in the fouled net to that in the clean net ψ under identical regular wave regimes can then be approximated as 10 ψ f f f c c d f s n f c d c s n c the equivalent solidity of the fouled nets can be obtained by introducing s n c 2 d l d l 2 0 26 and the corresponding experimental ψ values into eqs 7 and 10 the equivalent net solidity of the cage models with 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling were accordingly estimated to be s n f 0 31 and 0 375 respectively it is noted that the square elements in fig 20 were assumed to be oriented normal to the wave direction this assumption didn t significantly affect the resulting equivalent solidity of the fouled nets in the study provided that the wave incidence angle remained the same relative to the clean and fouled square elements the net solidity of the fouled cage models is an unknown parameter which is calculated using eq 7 and eq 10 based on the experimental data eq 10 provides an estimate for the s n f c d f the equivalent diameter of the net d the kc number the d l value and c d f in eq 7 all depend on the unknown s n f value therefore eq 7 should be iteratively solved for a proper estimate of s n f 3 6 3 ψ values under regular and irregular waves as aforementioned the tests on the clean and fouled cage models were repeated using irregular wave trains which its results will appear in a separate paper however by applying above procedure to the ψ data from the irregular wave tests vales of s n f 0 33 and 0 45 were obtained in the cage models of 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling respectively the s n f values under irregular waves were apparently and interestingly higher than those under regular waves these ψ values under regular and irregular waves similarly differed fig 21 the mean ψ value under irregular waves was 1 64 and 2 44 respectively in the cage models of 6 and 20 mm long fouling the corresponding mean ψ value under regular waves was 1 20 and 1 44 respectively therefore the effects of the soft fouling on the force amplitude markedly varied under regular and irregular waves this might be ascribed to high irregularity of the soft fouling listing under irregular waves irregular listing of the fouling was imposing a comparatively higher congestion level to the flow passage and was also increasing the fluid net interaction areas resulting on higher wave forces to the cage it can therefore be concluded that tests under regular waves might underestimate the soft fouling effects on the wave induced forces moments in the cage the net solidity in a clean net s n c is a parameter of net structure and does not depend on the wave parameters however the soft fouling structure continuously changes in a wave regime thus is dependent on the wave parameters this important fact should not be undermined when an equivalent net solidity s n f is defined for the soft fouling with the aim of its incorporating to available formula for the drag force coefficient calculation the results of the current study shows that s n f is dependent to the fouling density and the wave conditions regularity or irregularity in sections 3 6 2 and 3 6 3 the influence of fouling on the drag force was attributed to the influence of fouling on the net solidity on the kc number and on the equivalent diameter see eq 7 the drag force coefficient in the clean and the fouled cages can be also extracted from the current test data to this aim an accurate 3d analytical model of the cage is needed the model should be capable of correctly calculating the temporal variation of the wave force in individual horizontal and vertical elements of the net twines and the floating and sinker collars the water depth the orientation of the elements relative to the wave incidence and the deformations of all elements have to be taken into consideration the analytical model has to account for the dry and wet conditions of elements close to the water surface the wave height build up inside the cage and its attenuation around the cage the model has to calculate and incorporate continuous wave induced deformations of the cage structure including the net and collars it should also account for the dynamic and buoyancy effects the mooring system response etc a matrix of varying c d and c m is formed the cage is then analytically modelled under one of the wave trains of the experimental study using one pair of c d and c m in the matrix the global surge force time series from the analytical model is calculated and compared to the corresponding experimental force time series the prediction error is calculated for each pair of c d and c m in the main matrix the c d and c m pair which brings minimum force prediction error is identified the procedure is repeated for all eight wave cases considered in the experiment to choose the most appropriate pair of c d and c m the procedure is repeated for the fouled cages to obtain the corresponding c d and c m pair this alternative however is a demanding task and remains out of the scope of the present paper but can be part of future studies 3 6 4 pixel histogram analysis a pixel histogram analysis similar to gansel et al 2015 was also performed to evaluate the net solidity in the clean net s nc and in the fouled nets s nf high resolution digital photos covering an area of 4 4 grids of the clean net and fouled nets were prepared each digital photo was converted to a black and white 8 bit 256 levels image to discriminate pixels occupied by the twines soft fouling from the pixels on the unoccupied areas of the net the pixel histogram of each image was then obtained which provided a discrete function of number of pixels against 256 grey levels 0 for black to 255 for white fig 22 shows as an example the original colour image the black and white image and the pixel histogram for the net with 6 mm long fouling the ratio of number of pixels in grey layers 128 255 to the total number of pixels layers 0 255 were 0 24 0 51 and 0 84 for the clean cage and for the cages of 6 mm and 20 mm long artificial fouling respectively the pixel ratio of the clean net 0 24 was reasonably close to its theoretical s n c 0 26 see section 3 6 2 and could be straightforwardly incorporated in eq 10 the pixel ratios of 0 51 and 0 84 for the cages with 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling however didn t represent the solidity of the fouled nets due to the hydrodynamics of the soft fouling in waves in the fouled net the twines did swing in wave therefore their projected area stayed close to the static pixel ratio in a pixel histogram analysis the soft fouling organisms swing to minimize their projected areas against the flow which become considerably smaller than those obtained from a static pixel histogram analysis therefore a reduction factor had to be introduced to the static pixel data of the swinging portion of a fouled net before defining the net solidity for the case of present tests a factor of 0 23 was leading to s n f 0 24 0 23 0 27 0 30 and s n f 0 24 0 23 0 6 0 38 which were comparable to s n f values obtained in section 3 6 2 for the clean and fouled cage models of 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling respectively as in section 3 6 3 the s n f values varied under regular and irregular waves in the case of irregular waves introducing a factor of 0 33 to the static pixel ratio of the swinging portions provided s n f 0 33 and s n f 0 44 which reasonably agreed to s n f 0 33 and 0 45 reported in section 3 6 2 for the clean and fouled cage models of 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling respectively the reduction factors presented in this section are however tentative until confirmed by additional studies it is worth mentioning that a similar approach a reduction factor was introduced to the thickness of soft marine fouling before calculating the wave forces in fatigue life analysis of an offshore jacket platform zeinoddini et al 2016a 2016b 4 conclusions the present paper reports the results of a series of small scale physical model tests conducted to study the effects of marine fouling on the hydrodynamic forces in 3d aquaculture net cages the cage models included one clean net and two artificially fouled nets eight regular wave cases of different heights periods and steepness were considered the time series of the surge and sway forces as well as the pitch and roll moments were obtained and analysed the main findings from the current experimental study can be summarised as follows the surge force amplitude was notably greater around 2 5 to 4 times than the sway force amplitude depending on the wave properties and the fouling conditions the surge force amplitude and the pitch moment amplitude increased by the fouling presence and further by the fouling length it turned the opposite with the sway force and roll moment the force temporal profiles were almost regular but contained higher harmonics manifesting themselves as small surplus fluctuations around a main harmonic the amplitude of the high order harmonics grew smaller by the fouling presence and furthermore by the fouling length the sway force was almost in phase but kept a phase shift of around π 2 relevant to the surge force the latter appeared to be in phase with the water surface elevation at the centre point of the cage the wave induced forces moments amplitudes decreased by the wave period at a constant wave height but increased by the wave height at a constant wave period the asymmetry of the surge and sway force waveforms increased by the fouling presence and further by the fouling length the response amplitude operators raos in surge and pitch showed a maximum increase of 72 and 36 by the fouling the raos in sway and roll showed a maximum decrease of 26 and 32 by the fouling for the wave cases examined the force and moment raos were not significantly dependent to the wave height variations it was noticed that the effects of the soft fouling on the force moment amplitude were markedly stronger under irregular waves as compared to those under regular waves it was concluded that tests under regular waves might lead to underestimation of the soft fouling effects on the wave induced forces moments it was shown that available formulae for the drag force coefficient in clean nets can be used for the fouled cages subjected to regular waves by introducing a proper equivalent net solidity the net solidity of the clean cage model was equal to 0 26 the solidity of the fouled nets was back calculated and found to be around 0 31 and 0 375 in the surge forces in cages with 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling respectively the fouled net solidity was also obtained from a pixel histogram analysis it was however necessary to decompose the net solidity to the swinging and non swinging portions the latter had to be multiplied by a reduction factor before its introducing to the drag coefficient formulae the current experimental data form a basis for calibration validation of numerical models of floating mariculture cages the validated numerical models may be used to extend the experimental findings credit authorship contribution statement f

20260,previous experiments on the fouling current and fouling wave interactions were mostly limited to two dimensional 2d net panels or isolated twines the current paper deals with the wave induced forces moments in three dimensional 3d physical models of a gravity net cage the colonial hydroid ectopleura larynx a common fouling organism in the aquaculture industry was artificially modelled and considered in the current experiments a clean cage and cages with different fouling lengths were tested under deep water regular wave trains the time series of the wave induced forces moments in the surge sway roll and pitch degrees of freedom were recorded and analysed the experimental results showed that the surge force amplitude increased up to 72 by the fouling but the sway force amplitude decreased up to 26 the asymmetry of the surge and sway force waveforms increased by the fouling respectively the effects of the fouling on the force moment response amplitude operators rao were also studied pixel histogram analysis was performed to define equivalent net solidities of the fouled nets in general the tests under regular waves were found to underestimate the soft fouling effects on the wave induced forces moments as compared to those carried out under irregular waves keywords marine fouling regular waves laboratory experiments aquaculture cage surge sway forces pixel histogram analysis 1 introduction marine aquaculture plays an important role in seafood production which is expected to expand rapidly to meet the increasing demands straume et al 2020 they are however progressively forced offshore because of space limitation and pollution caused by seizure navigation and other man made activities offshore waves provide a high rate water exchange in the net cage which effectively benefits the health and growth of the fish and the products quality strong offshore waves and currents however may induce large forces deformations to the fishing net reduce the effective volume and negatively affect the health of the fish in order to ensure the structural integrity of an offshore net cage it is imperative to have proper insight into the hydrodynamic response and forces induced by energetic offshore waves a number of previous researchers experimentally and or numerically addressed the forces induced by irregular waves on net panels gravity net cages submersible net cages and floating collars extra relevant studies were listed in dong et al 2010 li et al 2013a and zhao et al 2010 colbourne and allen 2001 reported their field observations experimental model and numerical simulation results on motions and forces created by regular and irregular waves in aquaculture cages song et al 2006 experimentally investigated the horizontal forces from the regular waves in net panels and provided a calculation method lader et al 2007a experimentally and numerically investigated the interaction of regular waves with plane nets of different solidities zhao et al 2008 experimentally and numerically investigated the inertia and drag forces created by regular waves on plane nets wu et al 2008 experimentally and numerically studied the hydrodynamic force coefficients in a floating gravity net cage under different regular wave trains kristiansen 2010 numerically investigated the forces induced by regular waves in the floating collars of aquaculture cages xu et al 2012 numerically investigated the hydrodynamic response of multiple net cages in regular waves li et al 2013b numerically investigated the dynamic response of a floating fish cage under regular waves and current grue 2014 experimentally and numerically studied the current wave induced loads in the mooring lines of a conventional gravity net cage kristiansen et al 2015 experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic forces and the dynamics of a gravity net cage scaled model under waves and current kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 experimentally and numerically evaluated the mooring loads in an aquaculture net cage under wave current actions huang et al 2016 numerically studied the wave induced forces and deformations in a floating collar chen and christensen 2018 presented a numerical model for simulating current and wave interaction with a floater net system dong et al 2019 used experimental modelling to investigate the hydrodynamic forces on different types of net panels in waves the effects of the net solidity the net material and the knots pattern were examined bi et al 2020b provided an artificial neural network ann model to predict the structural failure of hdpe high density poly ethylene net cages in typhoon waves on the other hand underwater surface of man made structures is quickly covered by aquatic organisms called marine fouling which is defined as undesirable accumulation of biological organisms such as bacteria algae plant and animal colonies on artificial surfaces immersed in seawater hellio and yebra 2009 marine fouling constitutes serious problems in the aquaculture industry as it negatively affects the mariculture operation and the structural integrity it considerably increases the weight of the structure and culture equipment threatens the stability of suspended culture systems reduces the lifespan of the mooring lines decreases the flow exchange across the nets affects the water quality within the enclosures and threatens the fish health lader et al 2015 in particular marine fouling changes the flow regime around the structure and the hydrodynamic forces induced to the cage even though such negative impacts are acknowledged by the research community and governmental bodies there is still limited knowledge about fouling related effects on the fish cage hydrodynamics extra detailed studies have been called for to get insights to effects of different fouling types on the hydrodynamic response of cage systems under waves and current actions gansel et al 2015 there are handful researches dealing with the marine fouling effects on the current wave induced forces in aquaculture fish cages swift et al 2006 experimentally studied increase in the drag force due to marine fouling on a plane net the drag force was measured at different tow speeds for live marine fouling gansel et al 2015 investigated marine fouling effects on the current induced forces on plane nets towing tank tests were conducted on clean and fouled nets lader et al 2015 investigated the current induced drag forces in marine fouled nets covered with artificial hydroid ectopleura larynx towing tank tests at various speeds were conducted to investigate the drag force on the fouled twines the wave propagating through a square array of marine fouled net cages was numerically investigated by bi et al 2017 using cfd modelling the wave height inside and around the net cage arrays was also measured and analysed bi et al 2018 conducted laboratory model testing and numerical simulation of the hydroid fouling effects on the current induced drag force and flow through the plane nets the hydrodynamic load on the biofouled plane nets reportedly increased up to 10 times as compared to that in the clean net bi et al 2020a experimentally studied the hydroids effects on the wave induced force and motion responses in plane nets they noticed that with the most severely biofouled net the maximum horizontal motion amplitude was 3 84 times of that in the clean net nobakht kolur et al 2021a experimentally investigated the hydraulic responses of the clean and artificially fouled 3d net cages under regular wave trains they noticed that attenuation of the wave height and energy downstream of the cage models were increased by the fouling presence and length nobakht kolur et al 2021b experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic responses of the clean and marine fouled net cages under irregular waves the results showed that the surge force amplitude increased up to 160 by the fouling they indicated that the sway force amplitude decreased up to 50 by the fouling the aforementioned review of the literature implies that despite the important contributions of previous studies effects of marine fouling on the wave induced forces to aquaculture net cages have not received due attentions the works on the wave induced forces in marine fouled net cages were mostly limited to 2d net panels or isolated twines the current paper reports the results of the experimental studies addressing the marine fouling effects on the wave induced forces in 3d models of the gravity net cages the cage models included one clean cage and two fouled cages of different fouling lengths the colonial hydroid ectopleura larynx was artificially modelled and considered in the current experiments time series of the in line surge and cross line sway forces as well as the pitch and roll moments generated by regular waves in the clean and fouled fish cage models were obtained and analysed the main purpose was to investigate how the wave induced forces were affected by the presence of the fouling and by the fouling density length the wave forces reported in the current study also include those received by the collars the floating collar may receive a good part of the wave force because the water particle velocities accelerations are comparatively high around the mean water surface level the contribution of floating collar due to wave force to the total force in clean cage models was reported to be around 28 kristiansen 2010 this percentage noticeably decreases in a marine fouled cage previous studies conducted on marine fouled planar nets showed an up to 3 88 times increase in the wave force due to the fouling presence on the net bi et al 2020a 2 materials and methods 2 1 the fish cage model the cage model used in the current experiments features a1 80 scale of an existing gravity fish cage operating in offshore waters the froude similarity law was applied for the scaling of the physical model and the wave regime the geometric mechanical specifications of the scaled net cage model used in the current experiments are presented in table 1 the floating collar in the prototype cage comprised two concentric buoyant tubular rings made of hdpe pipes two small diameter ldpe low density poly ethylene pipes were separately wrapped into circles and their ends were then girth welded the two rings were interconnected using equally spaced radial brackets to form a collar consisting of two concentric buoyant rings the dimensions of the floating collar and the brackets observed the scaling ratio but satisfying the scaling rules for the collar bending stiffness was not viable the bending stiffness ei of the full scale floating hdpe collar was about 670 kn m2 where e is the young s modulus of the material and i is the second area moment of the collar cross section the bending stiffness of the floating collar in 1 80 scale would be ei 80 5 or about 2 0 10 4n m2 which was too small the ldpe pipes used in the current study for the floating collar tube had a bending stiffness of 6 4 10 3 n m2 n m2 this implies that the bending stiffness of the floating collar in the present model was around 32 times stiffer than that of an ideally scaled collar elastic deformations of the collar in the present cage models were therefore expected to remain small as compared to those in an ideally scaled collar the waves in the current study were properly scaled to the design waves in the prototype cage meaning that the floating collar in the prototype net cage would experience higher bending deformations as compared to that in the current experiment see fig 6 it is reiterated that the focus of the current paper is on the overall wave loads induced to the wave cage effects of the collar stiffness on overall wave actions were reportedly insignificant xu et al 2013 a small diameter ldpe pipe was also wrapped to circle to form the sinker collar a steel wire was inserted in the sinker collar to provide the target weight in the model several holes were drilled in the ldpe pipe to assist the collar sinking during the installation of the cage model please see the zoomed area in fig 1 polyester pes nets were used to model the cylindrical suspended net chamber the net had a compressed texture and it was manufactured according to norwegian standard ns 9415 2009 by toorbafan company the net had a twine diameter of d 2 8 mm a square mesh size of l 20 mm and a solidity of s n 0 26 fig 2 the net solidity of the clean net was estimated using the mathematical formulation of s n 2 d l d l 2 the net cage model was bottomless to reduce the complexity of the wave cage interactions the twine diameter the mesh size the mesh solidity and the material properties of the netting in the physical modelling remained nearly the same as those in the full scale cage this implies that the geometric mechanical scaling was not also held for the netting reportedly satisfying both the reynolds number and the net size solidity similitude in the model and in full scale cages is unviable kristiansen et al 2015 kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 xu et al 2013 the twines would have turned considerably thin if the 1 80 scaling was applied resulting in very low reynolds numbers in the model than those in the full scale this was causing a great difference in the model hydrodynamics as compared to that in the full scale kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 the proportion of the reynolds dependent frictional viscous drag force to the pressure form drag force in the physical model and the prototype would also differ with scaling of the twines dimensions palczynski 2000 the reynolds numbers were calculated based on the h and t values in the full scale and model scale table 3 the reynolds numbers at water surface elevation were in range of 440 to 760 and 3 900 to 6 800 at the model scale and at full scale respectively the ratio of the reynolds numbers of the full and model scales was thus around 9 the scaled model of floating hdpe circular fish cage with the clean net is presented in fig 1 a spread mooring system was used for position keeping of the net cage model it comprised four taut mooring lines l1 to l4 four v bridles were interconnecting the lines to the floating collar fig 3 b they allowed for distribution of the mooring lines reactions round the collar the upstream and downstream mooring lines l1 and l2 stayed in the wave direction and the port and starboard mooring lines l3 and l4 remained perpendicular to the wave direction fig 3 b the mooring lines were made of nylon ropes of 1 mm diameter density of 1 120 kg m3 and the tensile stiffness of around 240 n m the ending part of each mooring line l1 to l4 was fixed to a hang over support fig 3 c at the static initial condition the mooring lines had an angle of 2 4 to zero water level 2 2 the marine fouling model the colonial hydroid ectopleura larynx is a problematic fouling organism frequently found on aquaculture installations blöcher 2013 braithwaite and mcevoy 2004 guenther et al 2011 lader et al 2015 this type of soft marine fouling was considered in the current study live ectopleura larynx hydroids experience high death rates in laboratory experiments in freshwaters which will changes their hydraulic behaviour from hydroids in sea waters lader et al 2015 to reach the nearest behaviour to reality for this organism in the laboratory lader et al 2015 modelled artificial hydroid ectopleura larynx using nylon threads they also conducted field measurements on the growth of the ectopleura larynx to find the characteristics of the organism for modelling the lader et al 2015 approach with some adjustments was employed in the current laboratory modelling of the marine fouling the differences are as follows in the current study the fouling effects on the wave induced forces in the fish cage models were investigated but they studied the current induced forces in the lader study one two and four fouled twines with different arrangements and plane nets were studied in the current study the fouling was modelled on the whole 3d net cage in their study the smallest length of an organism was 6 4 mm the present study considers two uniform arrangements of soft fouling 6 mm and 20 mm long the study can be enriched by examining uniform soft fouling of lengths in between 6 and 20 mm and aggregation of fouling of varying lengths on a single net which will be considered as part of future studies on the subject in their study the organism head was also modelled but in the current study the heads were not modelled three net types were used in the current experiments they included one clean net without marine fouling and two fouled nets with fouling lengths of 6 mm and 20 mm all fouling treads had constant thickness and were uniformly distributed over entire twines length at a constant density the physical characteristics of the fouling used in the current experiments are listed in table 2 views of different net types are presented in fig 2 2 3 the wave properties all tests were carried out in the national iranian marine laboratory nimala tehran iran it is a member of the international towing tank conference ittc the flume is 402 m long 6 m wide and 4 5 m deep fig 3 a the tests were carried out at constant water depth of 3 98 m which allowed modelling of deep offshore waves the piston type wavemaker can produce both regular and irregular waves wave absorbers at the flume end were mitigating the wave reflection the wave iee software provided by flume designer company was used for data acquisition synchronization of the sensors and signals and post processing analysis of the outputs each cage model was examined under 8 regular wave cases see table 3 the wave cases were selected based on the wave flume limitations and scaling of sample sea states at the prototype cage site kristiansen et al 2015 and the extreme degree of exposure as per norwegian aquaculture site classification scheme klebert et al 2015 provided in table 4 the wavelengths were estimated using the dispersion equation and all wave cases were meeting the deep water conditions three wave cases had a constant steepness but their wave heights and periods varied wave cases 1 5 and 8 three wave cases had the same wave height but with different periods and steepness wave cases 5 6 and 7 three wave cases had the same periods but with different wave heights and steepness wave cases 3 6 and 8 for each individual wave case a wave train with 100 cycles in steady state duration was exposed to the cage models the fresh water in the flume had a mean density of 1 001 0 kg m3 the water temperature was monitored over the course of the experiments the temperature effect on the water density similar to that in zeinoddini et al 2014 and bakhtiari et al 2020 was estimated using faltinsen 1993 recommendations and remained below 0 05 to ensure the repeatability of the devices and the measuring system wave cases 5 to 8 were each repeated twice the maximum differences in the measured surge and sway mean peak to peak force amplitude were 2 5 and 2 respectively a waiting time of 20 min was considered between the consequent tests to achieve a calm water condition ersdal 2004 a number of tests were also repeated in the absence of the cage to verify the performance of the wave flume and the measuring instruments under storm conditions extreme waves and currents concurrently act on a floating cage depending on the offshore site condition and the proximity of the wave frequency to the natural frequency of the floating cage the current or wave forces might dominate regardless of waves or currents dominance their concurrent effects have to be considered in the design of a floating structure the present study only deals with the wave forces in marine fouled cages the current induced force on the marine fouled panels and cages was addressed by previous researchers e g bi et al 2018 lader et al 2015 combined current wave actions in a marine fouled floating cage can be considered as part of future studies on the subject 2 4 instrumentation time series of the water surface elevation was measured using six wave gauges arranged upstream downstream and at the centre axis of the cage see fig 3 b the data from the wave tests conducted in the presence and absence of a physical model were used to evaluate and calibrate the incident wave conditions a sample time series of the incident wave case 2 the steepest wave in table 3 t 0 8 s h 55 mm and s 0 055 is provided in fig 4 the figure characterises a regular wave whose height is close to 55 mm with minor inevitable variations the corresponding wave energy spectrum can be found in fig 9 a which shows that the water surface oscillation was regular and occurred at a frequency of 1 25 hz t 0 8 s the sampling rate in the wave gauges was 100 hz the standard linear displacement method was used for the wave gauges calibration wherein the relative water level at each gauge was changed at known intervals the relative water level data was correlated against the measured voltages the accuracy of wave gauges was 0 4 mm and the coefficient of variation was 0 35 four cameras were synchronized together to collect images from the cage movements during the test the frame rate was set to 15 hz time series of the forces induced by regular waves passing through the clean and fouled fish cage models were measured using load cells fixed at far end of each mooring line afore the fixed support fig 3 b c the pretension in the mooring lines of the three net cage models was set at 6 0 1n the load cells were particularly designed and fabricated for the current experiments each load cell included a cantilever steel leaf spring strain gauges were positioned on two sides of the leaf spring to form a wheatstone full bridge circuit the load cell had a resolution of 0 01n and the sampling rate was 100 hz prior to each test series the load cells were calibrated using loads applied by known weights the load cells found to remain linear non hysteresis and to present reasonably constant calibration coefficients all over the experiments 2 5 data processing method 2 5 1 the wave induced force moment data the wave induced force moment time series were related using below equations to the load cells data the in line surge force 1 f surge t f 1 t f 2 t cos θ the cross line sway force 2 f sway t f 3 t f 4 t cos θ the pitch moment 3 m pitch t r f 1 t f 2 t sin θ the roll moment 4 m roll t r f 3 t f 4 t sin θ where t is the time f surge t is the surge force in line to the wave travel direction f sway t is the sway force cross line to the wave travel direction m pitch t is the pitch moment at the cage centre m roll t is the roll moment at the cage centre r is the moment arm or the horizontal distance of the load cell from the cage centre 1 45 m f 1 t and f 2 t represent the wave induced forces in the upstream and downstream mooring lines respectively f 3 t and f 4 t represent the wave induced forces in the port and starboard mooring lines fig 3 b respectively and θ is the angle of the mooring lines to the mean water level it is noted that all load cells placed on the mooring lines l1 to l4 were unidirectional they were set to zero prior to each wave test thus were just reflecting the wave induced forces in a direction from the load cell position towards the cage centre fig 3 b c sample time series of the water surface elevation surge force sway force pitch moment and roll moment are presented in fig 5 they corresponded to model testing of the clean net cage under wave case 7 with h 80 mm and t 1 3 s for each model test the steady state portion of the signal which included around 100 wave force moment cycles was selected for data analysis the steady state portion was assumed to start after about 10 wave force moment cycles past the wave arrival below assumptions and approximations were made when deriving eqs 1 4 the mooring lines dynamics were neglected this can be justified by the lines low mass compared with the mass and added mass of the cage model a fixed value of θ 2 4 which represents the θ at pre test conditions see fig 3 c was used in eqs 1 4 in practice θ did not remain constant due to the wave induced pitch and roll motions of the floating collar images provided by the cine cameras monitoring the model tests indicated that the maximum variation range of θ was around 1 5 in lines l1 and l2 and 1 in lines l3 and l4 these appeared in the clean cage under wave case no 8 h 95 mm t 1 1 s the corresponding variation range in the surge and in the sway forces was estimated to be around 0 15 to 0 09 and around 0 09 to 0 06 respectively eq 1 ignores contributions of l3 and l4 lines when calculating the wave induced surge force eq 2 ignores contributions of l1 and l2 lines when calculating the wave induced sway force images taken by a high resolution cine camera installed atop of the cage models were used to assess the resulting errors maximum surge and sway motions over a total number of 24 test cases were noticed to occur in the clean cage under wave case 8 h 95 mm t 1 1 s fig 6 provides the corresponding images of the collar conditions before the wave arrival at maximum surge motion and at maximum sway motion the figure indicates that at maximum surge motion the horizontal offset of the collar centre was around 22 mm considering a pretension of 6 n in the mooring lines the contribution of l3 and l4 lines to the surge force at this extreme condition would be around 0 18 n the concurrent surge force provided by eq 1 was 3 04 n this yields to an error of around 5 6 in maximum surge force calculation the corresponding error for the sway forces was around 12 it is noted that the errors estimated reflect the two most extreme cage motions and expectedly grow lower at smaller cage offsets 2 5 2 amplitude definitions the force moment time series were separately analysed using a zero crossing method the interval between an up and the next down zero crossings was defined as one half cycle the signal amplitude was defined as half distance from the positive peak in a half cycle and the negative peak in the next half cycle ½p2p this was called force amplitude f a p2p or moment amplitude m a p2p from the p2p method the signal amplitude was also defined as 2 times rms root mean squared value of the data points in each half cycle this was called force amplitude f a rms or moment amplitude m a rms from the rms method in fact in a perfectly sinusoidal signal the amplitudes computed using the two methods would be the same the mean drift force moment f d or m d caused by the second order wave potential effects was defined as the mean value of the corresponding signal over the steady state portion 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall variation trends of the wave induced forces moments sample time series of the wave induced surge and sway forces in the clean and two fouled cages under wave case no 8 h 95 mm and t 1 1 s are presented in fig 7 the concurrent time series of the water surface elevation at the centre of the cage wave gauge no 4 is also provided in the figure the abscissa in fig 7 illustrates the time t normalised by the wave period t fig 7 a indicates that at the cage centre the wave height was noticeably greater than that of the incident wave h 95 mm presumably due to a wave energy build up inside the cage table 5 compares the incident wave height and the wave height measured at the centre of the clean and two marine fouled cages with all test cases a wave height build up appeared at the centre of the cage relative to that for the incident wave a higher wave build up occurred inside the clean cage as compared to those inside the fouled cages fig 7 b shows that the surge force was almost in phase with the water surface elevation at the centre point of the cage the sway force fig 7 c however kept a phase lag of around t t 0 25 relevant to the surge force and the water surface elevation profile fig 7 b c show that the force amplitude in surge was notably higher than that in sway the surge force amplitude was increased by the fouling presence and further by the fouling length it turned the opposite with the sway force the front crest slope in the fouled cages was slightly steeper than the corresponding rear crest slope see marks a b and c in fig 7 the difference increased by the fouling length the positive amplitudes pos ampl in the surge force time series were greater than the corresponding negative amplitudes neg amp indicating on presence of a mean drift force the pos ampl and neg amp however almost equalled in the time series of the sway force and the water surface elevation the force profiles in fig 7 b c contained higher harmonics manifesting themselves as small surplus fluctuations around a main harmonic the period of the main harmonic was reasonably close to that for the incident wave t 1 1 s the higher harmonics were partly reflecting nonlinearities in the wave to force interactions wave overtopping effects and the cage dynamics and were more evident around the troughs and crests a marks in fig 7 b c fig 7 shows that a mean wave drift force f d was present in all wave cases tested however the ratio of the surge drift force to the surge force amplitude f d f a p2p was not high the f d f a p2p ratio of the surge force in the clean cage ranged from 5 to 19 with a mean value of 11 the mean f d f a p2p ratio of the surge force in both fouled cages was 9 it is noted that the water surface elevation data at the centre of the clean and two fouled cages fig 7 a were obtained from separate tests at different times thus they are not concurrent for ease of comparison the water surface elevation curves of in fig 7 a were manually aligned to show almost concurrent peaks and troughs in the three cages with each cage model however the data for the water surface elevation fig 7 a the surge force fig 7 b and the sway force fig 7 c are concurrent fig 8 compares as an example the f a p2p f a rms and f d of the surge force in the clean net against the wave case number the figure shows that the force amplitudes obtained from p2p and rms methods differed but were relatively close fig 9 compares the f a p2p f a rms ratios for the surge and sway forces and the m a p2p m a rms ratios for the roll and pitch moments the amplitude ratios from the two models stayed close but below unity meaning that the force moment responses were not quite sinusoidal the regularity of the force moment responses was slightly improved by the fouling presence and the fouling length the error bars show that the f a p2p f a rms and m a p2p m a rms ratios did not vary significantly among different wave cases because the force moment amplitudes obtained from the p2p and rms methods were relatively close hereafter only the force moment amplitudes obtained from the p2p method will be presented to avoid duplication of information 3 2 the power spectral densities psds the psds of the wave profiles and the wave induced forces moments were computed using their corresponding time series as an example the psd of the water surface elevation for incident wave case 2 t 0 8 s h 55 mm and s 0 055 is presented in fig 10 a it is noted that wave case 2 was the steepest wave used in the current experiments fig 10 b c provide psds of the surge and sway forces respectively in the clean cage model under wave case 2 the ordinate of all psds in the figure were normalised by their maximum power the psds of the water surface elevation as well as the surge and sway forces in fig 10 exhibit a dominant peak around 1 25 hz or the frequency of the incident regular wave case 2 the figure implies that in general the wave data and the force responses were fairly regular a magnified psd was also provided in each plot of fig 10 the inserts reveal smaller psd peaks at frequencies 2 and 3 times of the frequency of the main harmonic in the wave and in the force signals this implies that small amplitude high order harmonics were also present in the wave profile the high order harmonics appeared to have become stronger in the force signals 3 3 the response amplitude operators in the current study the response amplitude operator rao is used as a linear transfer function to relate the wave induced force moment amplitude to the wave amplitude as an example the surge force and sway force raos for the clean cage model are presented in fig 11 the overall trends in the surge and sway force raos were relatively similar however the surge force rao stayed notably higher than that in sway the ratio of the sway surge raos varied from around 0 22 to 0 48 depending on the wave case almost all rao plots in fig 11 peaked at frequencies around 0 9 hz as aforementioned three wave cases 3 6 and 8 had similar wave periods t 1 1 s but different wave heights therefore three different data points for the raos were provided at this frequency the surge force raos in fig 11 had a mean value of 31 2 n m a standard deviation of 4 9 n m and a coefficient of variation cov of 0 157 the sway force raos had a mean value of 13 3 n m a standard deviation of 1 3 n m and a cov of 0 097 the sway force raos therefore were less scattered compared to the surge force raos the surge and sway force raos both grew smaller by increasing frequency possibly due to higher wave cancelation of short length waves it is noted that the response amplitude operator rao assumes a linear relationship between the response and the wave amplitude of a floating structure therefore at least theoretically waves of different heights can be used to obtain the relationship between rao and frequency on the other hand floating structures do not usually act as linear wave structure systems because terms such as the wave second order interactions high waves asymmetry the mooring system nonlinearity viscous components of the fluid flow wave overtopping wave slamming the wet and dry condition changes near the water surface dependency of the hydrodynamic mass and damping force coefficients to the response amplitude quadratic drag force terms and large deformations of the soft fouling nonlinearly affect the global response of a floating structure in waves despite these limitations the frequency domain approach and raos are frequently employed in the design and dynamic analysis of floating structures because they provide valuable information on the force and motion responses of the structure fredriksson et al 2003a 2003b o donnell et al 2021 in addition the wave height data are also included in fig 11 and later in fig 15 to demonstrate the extent of nonlinearities caused by the wave height on the rao values and on the wave horizontal asymmetry factor μ this might justify a linear assumption for the wave height wave load mechanism in the cage models for this reason in fig 12 the mean rao from the wave cases 3 6 and 8 is provided at t 1 1 s fig 12 a presents the surge force raos in the clean and the two fouled cage models against the wave frequencies tested the rao values increased by the fouling presence which can be ascribed to the increase in the projected area of the twines as well as increase in the net solidity of the fouled cages the surge force rao grew slightly higher by increase in the fouling length the fouling effect on the surge force rao ranged from 13 to 72 the effects were intensified by increase in the wavelength and by the wave height e g compare wave cases 1 to 8 fig 12 b depicts the sway force raos against the wave frequency unlike the surge forces the rao values in sway decreased by the fouling presence and furthermore by the fouling length this could be stemmed from the fact that the fouling reduced the size thus the power of the eddies formed past the fish cage similar observations were reported for the vortex induced vibrations of fouled cylinders tested in uniform current zeinoddini et al 2016a 2016b 2018 jadidi et al 2018 jadidi and zeinoddini 2020 the fouling effect on the sway force rao ranged from 3 to 26 the effects were intensified as the wavelength or the wave height increased on the whole the rao trends in the clean and fouled cages remained fairly similar fig 12 c presents the roll moment rao against the wave frequency similar to that with the sway force rao the roll moment rao values decreased by the presence of the fouling and furthermore by the fouling length the reasons were like as those described for sway force raos fig 12 d depicts the pitch moment rao against the wave frequencies examined on the whole the variation trends in the pitch raos remained similar in the clean and fouled cages the pitch moment rao values however were increased by the fouling presence the reasons were like as those described for the surge force raos 3 4 wave parameters effects here the effects of variations in the wave period height and steepness on the wave induced forces moments are discussed to evaluate the influence of the wave period three wave cases of constant heights but varying wave periods were selected the p2p amplitude of the surge sway forces and roll pitch moments in the clean and the two fouled cage models are presented in fig 13 fig 13 a shows that the surge force amplitude slightly decreased by increase in the wave period this was true both in the clean and in the fouled cages in fact as per airy wave theory the water particle velocities accelerations thus the amplitudes of the drag inertia forces are inversely proportional to the wave period see eq 8 fig 13 a shows that the amplitude of the wave induced surge force was increased by the fouling presence and further by the fouling length a similar trend could be noticed with the pitch moment amplitude fig 13 d fig 13 b c show that on the contrary the sway force amplitude and the roll moment amplitude were decreased by the fouling presence the fouling length made almost no difference to the sway force amplitude three wave cases of constant periods but varying heights were selected to evaluate the wave height effects on the wave induced forces moments the corresponding p2p amplitudes of the surge sway forces and roll pitch moments in the clean and the two fouled cage models are presented in fig 14 the surge sway force amplitude and the roll pitch moment amplitude all increased by the wave height the wave induced force amplitude in the collar and in individual twines are tentatively proportional to the power 2 of the water particle velocity say power 2 of the wave height see eq 8 the force moment amplitudes in the clean and fouled cage models however varied almost linearly by the wave height fig 14 this can be ascribed to the time lags existed between the peak wave force in different twines and across the collar the lag magnitude was dependent to the orientation spacing of the twines relative to the wave crest the time lags cause partial force moment cancellation between the twines thus the overall cage force might no longer remain proportional to the power two of the wave height fig 14 shows that the amplitude of the surge force and the pitch moment increased and the amplitude of the sway force and roll moment decreased by the fouling presence the fouling length had small effects on the amplitude of the sway force and roll moment three wave cases of small steepness case 4 h l 0 023 moderate steepness case 6 h l 0 042 and high steepness case 2 h l 0 055 were selected to evaluate the wave steepness effects on the wave induced forces moments the corresponding p2p amplitudes of the surge sway forces and roll pitch moments in the clean and the two fouled cage models are presented in fig 15 the figure shows that in all cases the wave induced force moment amplitudes increased from small steepness to the moderate steepness then decreased for the steepest wave from the smallest towards the moderate steepness the wave height increased from 70 to 80 mm and the wave period decreases from 1 4 to 1 1 s accordingly the amplitudes of the water particle velocity acceleration say the amplitudes of the wave induced force moment increased from the moderate steepness towards the steepest wave case the wave height decreases from 80 to 55 mm 31 and the wave period decreases from 1 1 to 0 8 s 27 as a result the amplitudes of the water particle velocity acceleration and the wave induced force moment decreased the steepness effects on the force moment amplitudes in the two fouled cage models in fig 15 were well comparable to those in the clean cage model however in all cases at high steepness the differences between the force moment amplitudes in the clean and the fouled cages grew small 3 5 asymmetry features the current test results showed that the positive and negative amplitudes differed almost in all force moment waveforms this could be attributed to i possible asymmetry in the wave profile ii the wave drift force effects iii the hydraulic response of the cage to the passing wave iv the inherent depth dependence of the water particle velocity acceleration in the wave field asymmetries in the wave induced surge force were also noticed by lader et al 2007b in laboratory measurements of forces on three different 2d planar net panels exposed to five different regular wave cases they reported that the positive amplitude was larger than the negative amplitude in the current study the horizontal asymmetry factor μ of the force moment and water surface elevation time series was described as follows lader et al 2007b 5 μ pos amp pos amp neg amp where pos amp is the mean positive amplitudes over the steady part of the time series and neg amp is the corresponding mean negative amplitude it is noted that the asymmetry factors reported hereafter do not include the drift force effects because when calculating μ the drift force was subtracted from the force moments time series fig 16 presents μ values of the wave profile at the centre axis of the cage against the wave steepness s the figure shows that with all net cages wave cases μ for the wave profile remained very close to μ value in a linear sinusoidal wave μ 0 5 the figure also indicates that in the fouled cages μ moved closer to the μ 0 5 line figs 17 and 18 provide the μ values of the surge and sway waveforms respectively in the clean and the two fouled cage models the μ values in figs 17 and 18 are grouped once against the wave period and once against the wave steepness the data in the former belonged to wave cases of 1 5 and 8 with constant wave steepness of s 0 051 but varying wave periods the data with the latter belonged to wave cases of small steepness case 4 s 0 023 moderate steepness case 6 s 0 042 and high steepness case 2 s 0 055 fig 17 shows that all μ values of surge force were greater than 0 5 meaning that the mean positive amplitude was greater than the mean negative amplitude the surge force asymmetry might be explained by regular wave theories which suggest that the maximum velocity at the wave crest is larger than the maximum velocity at the wave trough moreover under the wave crest the exposed area of the cage model grew larger than that under the wave trough fig 17 shows that the asymmetry of the surge force waveforms increased by the fouling presence and most often by the fouling length with the sway force the μ values remained greater than 0 5 in the cage with 20 mm fouling fig 18 for a majority of cases μ in the cage with 6 mm fouling remained greater than 0 5 no discernible correlation could be drawn in fig 18 between the μ values and the wave period t or the steepness s of the regular waves 3 6 quantifying the fouling effects 3 6 1 fouling effects on the force moment amplitude to quantify the fouling effects on the wave induced force amplitude below parameter ψ was defined 6 ψ f a f f a c or m a f m a c where f a f and m a f are the p2p force and moment amplitude in a fouled cage respectively and f a c and m a c are the p2p force and moment amplitude in the clean cage respectively as an example fig 19 a b depict ψ in surge and sway respectively against the wave height h the figure shows that ψ in surge stayed apparently above unity this turned the opposite in sway with the surge force ψ max 1 72 ψ mean 1 44 and ψ min 1 32 in the cage of 20 mm long fouling and ψ max 1 35 ψ mean 1 20 and ψ min 1 13 in the cage of 6 mm long fouling fig 19 a indicates that ψ in surge increased notably by the fouling length but it didn t show an apparent ascending or descending trend by the wave height in overall f a f in surge was between 13 and 72 higher than f a c depending on the fouling length and wave characteristics the f a f increase was partly attributed to the increase caused by the fouling to the net solidity and to the wave interaction areas unlike hard fouling soft fouling swing in waves the net and the fouling dynamics are essentially different this can cause significant build up in relative velocities accelerations thus in the wave induced drag and inertia forces in sway ψ was smaller than unity fig 19 b this stemmed mostly from the fact that the fouling was suppressing the wave induced motions the physics of the cross flow force in a cage subject to irregular waves apparently differs from that of the vortex induced vibration viv phenomena in cylindrical bodies however the amplitude of the cross flow force in cylinders covered by artificial marine fouling also reportedly decreases by the fouling presence zeinoddini et al 2016a 2016b 2017 2018 jadidi et al 2018 for the sway force in the cage with 20 mm long fouling ψ max 0 93 ψ mean 0 85 and ψ min 0 74 for the sway force in the cage model with 6 mm long fouling ψ max 0 97 ψ mean 0 88 and ψ min 0 79 therefore f a f in sway was between 3 and 26 smaller than f a c depending on the fouling length and wave characteristics for the sway force ψ in the cages with 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling demonstrated similar trends against the wave height but in general ψ moderately decreased by the fouling length 3 6 2 the net solidity and drag force coefficients in marine aquaculture cages the design wave height ratio to the diameter of the net twins h d is typically high the drag component therefore dominates the surge force induced by the wave to the net cage and the inertia component may be ignored zhao et al 2008 based on laboratory experiments on clean nets of varying solidity some previous researchers suggested formulations between the drag force coefficient c d and the net solidity s n for example dong et al 2019 proposed below empirical c d formula in plane nylon nets 7 c d 2 7 2 5 d ℓ 1 3 13 s n kc 3 1 5 kc u m t d where d is the twine s diameter ℓ is the mesh bar length kc is the keulegan carpenter number u m is the maximum water particle velocity and t is the wave period the solidity of a clean net can be defined as s n c 2 d l d l 2 no mathematical definition is currently available for the solidity of marine fouled nets s n f firstly due to unpredictability of the size features configuration of the organisms and secondly because soft organisms do not remain stationary and swing in the wave current regimes it is assumed here that eq 7 can also be applied to marine fouled nets provided that an equivalent solidity is defined for the fouled net ignoring the inertia component the amplitude of the surge force induced by a linear deep water regular wave of height h and period t to a square ℓ ℓ element in the clean net fig 20 a can be approximated as morison et al 1950 8 f c 1 2 t 2 ρ c d c s n c ℓ 2 π 2 h 2 ⅇ 2 k z where f c is the amplitude of the wave force induced to the square element of the clean net s n c is the clean net solidity k is the wave number ρ is the water density z is the water depth at centre of the square element and c d c is the drag coefficient in the clean net which is defined using eq 7 the same square element in the net is now assumed to be covered by the marine fouling fig 20 b the amplitude of the surge force induced by a linear deep water wave of height h and period t to the square element in the fouled net can be expressed as 9 f f 1 2 t 2 ρ c d f s n f ℓ 2 π 2 h 2 ⅇ 2 k z where f f is the amplitude of the wave force induced to the fouled net s n f is the equivalent solidity of the fouled net and c d f is the drag coefficient in the fouled net from eqs 8 and 9 the ratio of the amplitudes of the surge force in the fouled net to that in the clean net ψ under identical regular wave regimes can then be approximated as 10 ψ f f f c c d f s n f c d c s n c the equivalent solidity of the fouled nets can be obtained by introducing s n c 2 d l d l 2 0 26 and the corresponding experimental ψ values into eqs 7 and 10 the equivalent net solidity of the cage models with 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling were accordingly estimated to be s n f 0 31 and 0 375 respectively it is noted that the square elements in fig 20 were assumed to be oriented normal to the wave direction this assumption didn t significantly affect the resulting equivalent solidity of the fouled nets in the study provided that the wave incidence angle remained the same relative to the clean and fouled square elements the net solidity of the fouled cage models is an unknown parameter which is calculated using eq 7 and eq 10 based on the experimental data eq 10 provides an estimate for the s n f c d f the equivalent diameter of the net d the kc number the d l value and c d f in eq 7 all depend on the unknown s n f value therefore eq 7 should be iteratively solved for a proper estimate of s n f 3 6 3 ψ values under regular and irregular waves as aforementioned the tests on the clean and fouled cage models were repeated using irregular wave trains which its results will appear in a separate paper however by applying above procedure to the ψ data from the irregular wave tests vales of s n f 0 33 and 0 45 were obtained in the cage models of 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling respectively the s n f values under irregular waves were apparently and interestingly higher than those under regular waves these ψ values under regular and irregular waves similarly differed fig 21 the mean ψ value under irregular waves was 1 64 and 2 44 respectively in the cage models of 6 and 20 mm long fouling the corresponding mean ψ value under regular waves was 1 20 and 1 44 respectively therefore the effects of the soft fouling on the force amplitude markedly varied under regular and irregular waves this might be ascribed to high irregularity of the soft fouling listing under irregular waves irregular listing of the fouling was imposing a comparatively higher congestion level to the flow passage and was also increasing the fluid net interaction areas resulting on higher wave forces to the cage it can therefore be concluded that tests under regular waves might underestimate the soft fouling effects on the wave induced forces moments in the cage the net solidity in a clean net s n c is a parameter of net structure and does not depend on the wave parameters however the soft fouling structure continuously changes in a wave regime thus is dependent on the wave parameters this important fact should not be undermined when an equivalent net solidity s n f is defined for the soft fouling with the aim of its incorporating to available formula for the drag force coefficient calculation the results of the current study shows that s n f is dependent to the fouling density and the wave conditions regularity or irregularity in sections 3 6 2 and 3 6 3 the influence of fouling on the drag force was attributed to the influence of fouling on the net solidity on the kc number and on the equivalent diameter see eq 7 the drag force coefficient in the clean and the fouled cages can be also extracted from the current test data to this aim an accurate 3d analytical model of the cage is needed the model should be capable of correctly calculating the temporal variation of the wave force in individual horizontal and vertical elements of the net twines and the floating and sinker collars the water depth the orientation of the elements relative to the wave incidence and the deformations of all elements have to be taken into consideration the analytical model has to account for the dry and wet conditions of elements close to the water surface the wave height build up inside the cage and its attenuation around the cage the model has to calculate and incorporate continuous wave induced deformations of the cage structure including the net and collars it should also account for the dynamic and buoyancy effects the mooring system response etc a matrix of varying c d and c m is formed the cage is then analytically modelled under one of the wave trains of the experimental study using one pair of c d and c m in the matrix the global surge force time series from the analytical model is calculated and compared to the corresponding experimental force time series the prediction error is calculated for each pair of c d and c m in the main matrix the c d and c m pair which brings minimum force prediction error is identified the procedure is repeated for all eight wave cases considered in the experiment to choose the most appropriate pair of c d and c m the procedure is repeated for the fouled cages to obtain the corresponding c d and c m pair this alternative however is a demanding task and remains out of the scope of the present paper but can be part of future studies 3 6 4 pixel histogram analysis a pixel histogram analysis similar to gansel et al 2015 was also performed to evaluate the net solidity in the clean net s nc and in the fouled nets s nf high resolution digital photos covering an area of 4 4 grids of the clean net and fouled nets were prepared each digital photo was converted to a black and white 8 bit 256 levels image to discriminate pixels occupied by the twines soft fouling from the pixels on the unoccupied areas of the net the pixel histogram of each image was then obtained which provided a discrete function of number of pixels against 256 grey levels 0 for black to 255 for white fig 22 shows as an example the original colour image the black and white image and the pixel histogram for the net with 6 mm long fouling the ratio of number of pixels in grey layers 128 255 to the total number of pixels layers 0 255 were 0 24 0 51 and 0 84 for the clean cage and for the cages of 6 mm and 20 mm long artificial fouling respectively the pixel ratio of the clean net 0 24 was reasonably close to its theoretical s n c 0 26 see section 3 6 2 and could be straightforwardly incorporated in eq 10 the pixel ratios of 0 51 and 0 84 for the cages with 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling however didn t represent the solidity of the fouled nets due to the hydrodynamics of the soft fouling in waves in the fouled net the twines did swing in wave therefore their projected area stayed close to the static pixel ratio in a pixel histogram analysis the soft fouling organisms swing to minimize their projected areas against the flow which become considerably smaller than those obtained from a static pixel histogram analysis therefore a reduction factor had to be introduced to the static pixel data of the swinging portion of a fouled net before defining the net solidity for the case of present tests a factor of 0 23 was leading to s n f 0 24 0 23 0 27 0 30 and s n f 0 24 0 23 0 6 0 38 which were comparable to s n f values obtained in section 3 6 2 for the clean and fouled cage models of 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling respectively as in section 3 6 3 the s n f values varied under regular and irregular waves in the case of irregular waves introducing a factor of 0 33 to the static pixel ratio of the swinging portions provided s n f 0 33 and s n f 0 44 which reasonably agreed to s n f 0 33 and 0 45 reported in section 3 6 2 for the clean and fouled cage models of 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling respectively the reduction factors presented in this section are however tentative until confirmed by additional studies it is worth mentioning that a similar approach a reduction factor was introduced to the thickness of soft marine fouling before calculating the wave forces in fatigue life analysis of an offshore jacket platform zeinoddini et al 2016a 2016b 4 conclusions the present paper reports the results of a series of small scale physical model tests conducted to study the effects of marine fouling on the hydrodynamic forces in 3d aquaculture net cages the cage models included one clean net and two artificially fouled nets eight regular wave cases of different heights periods and steepness were considered the time series of the surge and sway forces as well as the pitch and roll moments were obtained and analysed the main findings from the current experimental study can be summarised as follows the surge force amplitude was notably greater around 2 5 to 4 times than the sway force amplitude depending on the wave properties and the fouling conditions the surge force amplitude and the pitch moment amplitude increased by the fouling presence and further by the fouling length it turned the opposite with the sway force and roll moment the force temporal profiles were almost regular but contained higher harmonics manifesting themselves as small surplus fluctuations around a main harmonic the amplitude of the high order harmonics grew smaller by the fouling presence and furthermore by the fouling length the sway force was almost in phase but kept a phase shift of around π 2 relevant to the surge force the latter appeared to be in phase with the water surface elevation at the centre point of the cage the wave induced forces moments amplitudes decreased by the wave period at a constant wave height but increased by the wave height at a constant wave period the asymmetry of the surge and sway force waveforms increased by the fouling presence and further by the fouling length the response amplitude operators raos in surge and pitch showed a maximum increase of 72 and 36 by the fouling the raos in sway and roll showed a maximum decrease of 26 and 32 by the fouling for the wave cases examined the force and moment raos were not significantly dependent to the wave height variations it was noticed that the effects of the soft fouling on the force moment amplitude were markedly stronger under irregular waves as compared to those under regular waves it was concluded that tests under regular waves might lead to underestimation of the soft fouling effects on the wave induced forces moments it was shown that available formulae for the drag force coefficient in clean nets can be used for the fouled cages subjected to regular waves by introducing a proper equivalent net solidity the net solidity of the clean cage model was equal to 0 26 the solidity of the fouled nets was back calculated and found to be around 0 31 and 0 375 in the surge forces in cages with 6 mm and 20 mm long fouling respectively the fouled net solidity was also obtained from a pixel histogram analysis it was however necessary to decompose the net solidity to the swinging and non swinging portions the latter had to be multiplied by a reduction factor before its introducing to the drag coefficient formulae the current experimental data form a basis for calibration validation of numerical models of floating mariculture cages the validated numerical models may be used to extend the experimental findings credit authorship contribution statement f

thus increasing the bearing capacity of the joint keywords composite to steel joint cohesive interface interfacial debonding numerical simulation 1 introduction with the development of ship industry towards high speed lightweight and large scale fibre reinforced plastic frp material has been studied and applied more and more in this field due to many advantages such as high stiffness lightweight and easy maintenance smith 1990 mouritz et al 2001 barsotti et al 2020 several analyses of ships in composite materials have been conducted looking at components chen and guedes soares 2007a gaiotti and rizzo 2012 kolanu et al 2016 shen et al 2017a b hirwani and panda 2018 towsend et al 2018 xie et al 2018 and the hull behaviour chen and guedes soares 2008 2011 sobey et al 2013a including their reliability guedes soares 1997 jeong and shenoi 1998 chen et al 2003 chen and guedes soares 2007b c sobey et al 2013b yangdas et al 2013 nowadays frp laminates or sandwich composite structures are also introduced in large ships as non load bearing members such as pedestal mast propellers but also as secondary bearing members such as superstructure transverse bulkhead and local decks li et al 2015 gaiotti et al 2018 kharghani and guedes soares 2018 2019 kharghani et al 2019 for the application of large composite components in steel hull vessels it is an essential task to ensure the reliability and economy of the connection between the composite material and the metal structure regarding joining composite substructures to the metal ship structure adhesive or bolted joints or a combination of these two are the only options as to bolt connection the manufacturing process of the joints tends to be complicated when the number of bolts is large thus reducing the production efficiency adhesive connection offers a long list of advantages compared to others the main advantages of adhesive joining are the reduction of the weight of the structure and the superior flexibility in joining dissimilar materials which enable in sequence the designer to choose the most fitting material for each part of the structure nevertheless it is difficult even impossible to implement adhesive connections in the shipbuilding shop because the temperature humidity and cleanliness of the environment are difficult to meet adhesive quality requirements even if structural adhesive tolerant to process conditions is selected in the construction the building process will bring challenges to the efficiency and quality of the ship structures the preferable solution is to prefabricate the composite steel joint components in a suitable working environment and then weld the joint component on the steel part to the hull in the yard shop without additional work for effective integration of composite parts into the metallic structure of a ship the composite to metal joints should fulfil some basic principles and requirements such as mechanical behaviour production cost easy application and low maintenance in the past years some types of hull superstructure and hull bulkhead composite steel joints have been presented and their mechanical or other behaviour has been verified by tests and numerical approaches hentinen et al 1997 developed four joint concepts for joining large frp sandwich parts to metal structures in which the overlaminate joint concept is confirmed to have higher static strength than the bolted joint and the adhesively bonded concept is more cost efficient reducing the manufacturing costs during the joining to the ship by as much as 50 wright et al 2000 examined the structural performance of a symmetric steel to composite bonded joint by experiments and numerical predictions in which the steel part bonded over the laminate bohlmann and fogarty 2002 report on a project to demonstrate the feasibility of building part of the superstructure of a us navy destroyer in composite material many different joint configurations and concepts to join two different materials were evaluated and a hybrid bolt adhesive joint was chosen mcgeorge et al 2003 developed a bonded tuning fork type joint offering some

an asymmetric joint through the use of a parametric variation of the geometric variables and genetic algorithms to search the design space for optimal solutions that will have a benefit to the performance of the joint under compressive loading yang et al 2011 report the finite element model development for assisting the design of a bonded joint system for a composite steel interface experimental results for the adhesive were published by ritter et al 2009 and speth et al 2010 together with fea results kharghani and guedes soares 2015a studied a composite to steel joint made of two plate channel that serve as external supports of the sandwich plate by a numerical approach the attachment of the steel joint to the structure is supported by a bracket this joint is used on a large scale hybrid composite steel balcony overhang of ships later small scale and large scale specimens of the joint were tested under imposed shear and bending loads to investigate its behaviour kharghani et al 2018 kharghani and guedes soares 2018 the mechanical properties of the sandwich panel and its skin were further compared before and after failure kharghani and guedes soares 2019 kotsidis et al 2015a investigated the influence of various geometry design parameters on the mechanical behaviour of a similar asymmetric sandwich composite steel joint under tensile and bending loads by numerical approach and presented a preferable size design of the joint static and fatigue tests were executed later to investigate the behaviour of that joint in tension loading kotsidis et al 2015b kharghani et al 2019 performed a three point bending test on the hybrid joint of the same geometry and size as in kotsidis et al 2015a clifford et al 2002 examined the mechanical response of an asymmetric joint between a glass fibre reinforced plastic gfrp material superstructure and a steel hull the adhesively bonded butt joint is comprised of a steel panel and a gfrp sandwich panel with the gfrp part bonded over the steel part the objective of this paper is to put forward the improvement schemes of the adhesively bonded composite to steel butt joint which has been defined through an earlier fe parametric study kotsidis et al 2015a and studied by fe simulation and tests kharghani et al 2019 in this paper a 3d nonlinear numerical model is set up to simulate the deflection stress fields and interfacial debonding of the hybrid joint under three point bending load contact elements with a cohesive zone model czm are adopted to simulate the adhesive interface between different materials cohesive parameters of the czm are obtained by repeated calculations to reconcile the numerical results to the experimental ones subsequently three design improvement schemes are proposed to relieve the stress concentration of the joint and upgrading its load capacity numerical simulations of the developed joints which adopt the cohesive parameters obtained before are carried out to verify the upgrading effects of the improved design schemes 2 synthesis of experimental test results 2 1 specimen geometry and manufacturing the geometry of the specimens without and with the reinforcing bolt is presented in fig 1 the adhesively bonded butt joint consists of a double lap steel frp part plus an frp sandwich part designed to connect a steel plate and a sandwich panel one end of the steel plate is folded to 15 and embedded into the core of the sandwich panel the top and bottom skins of the sandwich extend to the steel part as the double lap of the joint all interfaces between different materials are bonded only by vinylester resin during the manufacturing of the prefabricated joint the thicknesses of the core steel and skins are 30 10 and 2 5 mm respectively the length of the inclined steel inside the sandwich core is approximately 75 mm kharghani et al 2019 each size of the joint is derived from the previous research conclusion kotsidis et al 2015 the width of all specimens is equal to 100 mm fig 2 shows the views of the joint specimen the sandwich skins consisted of four layers of biaxial stitched e glass fabric together with crystic ve679pa vinylester resin the core of the sandwich is made of pro balsa standard wood 155 kg m3 from portugal whereas the steel panel is of ah36 grade the whole joint was formed by a resin infusion process with the vacuum bagging method at estaleiros navais de peniche sa shipyard 2 2 experimental set up the hybrid joint specimens were installed on the calibrated servo hydraulic mechanical test machine for a three point bending loading test fig 3 and fig 4 respectively show the test configuration and the locations of constraints and load the detailed information about the specimens and the test are presented in kharghani et al 2019 which will not be repeated here 2 3 experimental test results there are three specimens without bolts and four with one bolt in the middle width of the steel laminate sandwich part in the test program fig 5 presents the load deflection curves of the two types of specimens the curves slopes of these two types which represent the bending stiffness of the joints show no differences the bolts have been designed mainly to avoid any type of separation under tension load the position of the bolt is far from the local areas of damage initiation and propagation when the joint is in bending condition the experimental test results show that the bolt does not influence the joint s mechanical response under bending load therefore these two types are no longer distinguished in this paper fig 6 shows the seven failed specimens in the test it can be observed that the failure types of the specimens include core shear failure core tensile failure debonding on the steel core interface and debonding on the skin core interface however no eye visible failure indications were observed on the specimens surface during the loading process until the specimen suddenly collapsed completely and lost its bearing capacity it seems that all types of failure occurred at the same time during the frame of the captured movie the failure sequences of mentioned modes can t be distinguished by the test 3 fe analysis 3 1 element types material properties and boundary conditions all composite steel butt joint models in this paper are constructed using ansys mechanical apdl 18 0 software a 3 d 20 node structural solid element is adopted in the analysis namely solid186 this type of element is available in two forms one is homogeneous structural solid which is selected to stimulate the steel panel and the balsa wood core and the other is layered structural solid which is selected to stimulate the top and bottom skins of the joint uniform reduced integration technology is adopted for this element in the analysis the element section for the skin is defined as 4 layers with orthogonal anisotropy and linear elasticity properties of the biaxial stitched e glass fabric material elastic plastic material property with bilinear isotropic hardening criteria is applied to the steel panel and linear orthogonal anisotropy is applied to the core the material mechanical parameters are listed in table 1 figs 6 and 7 show the fe model of the joint with the boundary conditions and the local mesh of the critical zone it can be seen that the elements near the folded corner and the buried end of the steel plate were prone to debond are denser than in other places 3 2 boundary conditions a simple support constraint is applied to the joint on the lower surface nodes of the constraint section of both ends the nodes on one end are constrained by three displacement degrees of freedom while those on the other end are constrained by displacement degrees in vertical and width directions in the loading section the upper surface nodes are coupled in vertical displacement and a vertical displacement load of 16 mm is applied to the primary node which lies in the middle of the width of the section see fig 7 the positions of the constraint section and loading section are consistent with the test see fig 4 3 3 czm method and bilinear traction separation law cohesive zone models czm are widely adopted in delamination and debonding failure simulations the cohesive law i e the traction separation law is implemented in czm to infer the failure mechanism of the adhesive layer of the interface it is the constitutive relation between the traction p acting on the interface and the corresponding interfacial separation u n displacement jump across the interface the bilinear traction separation law proposed by alfano and crisfield 2001 is embedded in the ansys software and adopted in this study fig 8 it shows a linear elastic loading oa followed by a linear softening ac see fig 9 debonding is initiated at point a when the traction achieves the maximum traction stress σ m a x and completed when the traction goes back to zero at point c the slope of the first line k is the initial stiffness of the interface determining the separations u at the maximum traction σ m a x u c is the interface separation when the debonding is completed the area under the curve oac is the released energy due to debonding it is called the critical fracture energy g c which is equal to the fracture toughness of the interface and satisfies the following relation 1 g c 1 2 σ m a x u c the bilinear traction separation law for every debonding mode can be determined by three cohesive parameters initial stiffness k peak traction σ m a x or τ m a x and fracture toughness g c g c can be determined by conducting standard fracture mechanics experiments godani et al 2014 alizadeh and guedes soares 2019 where σ max and τ m a x are material parameters related to the length of the process zone and the tensile strength of the interface material but they are not easily measurable and their values are generally estimated by experiments alfano 2006 the initial stiffness k is often assumed as a high penalty parameter so that there exists an often wide range of values for k which both ensure a good prediction of the undamaged behaviour of the interface and avoid ill conditioning alfano 2006 zou et al 2002 based on their own experience proposed a value for the interface stiffness between 104 and 107 times the value of the interfacial strength per unit length using cohesive elements it is necessary to have a sufficient number of elements in the cohesive zone to capture the correct distribution of tensions the critical dimension of the finite element is along the crack propagation path studies have shown that element number between 2 and 5 was sufficient to predict the propagation of delamination which leads to very fine meshes in the delamination front turon et al 2007 gave guidelines to simulate delamination with coarser meshes the calculated cohesive zone length was increased when adopting lower interface traction values then the element size was increased with the demanded element numbers besides alfano and crisfield 2001 observed that variations of the maximum interfacial strength do not have a strong influence on the predicted results but that lowering the interfacial strength can improve the convergence rate of the solution the interfacial debonding of the hybrid butt joint belongs to the mix mode type so cohesive parameters for mode i and mode ii are both needed in the calculation detailed cohesive parameters adopted in this study are listed in table 2 in which the fracture toughnesses g c are adopted the experimental values in lee et al 2010 the interface peak tractions are determined according to equation 2 the relation between the interlaminar strengths was proposed by turon et al 2010 which ensure a correct energy dissipation when delamination propagates with cohesive elements under mixed mode fracture 2 τ m a x σ m a x g i i c g i c in this study the interfaces between different materials are simulated by bonded contact pairs an interface is composed of a contact surface and a target surface in the overlapped position which are simulated with the contact elements conta174 and target elements targe170 respectively both surfaces are defined with bilinear czm constitutive behaviours fig 10 shows the contact elements in the skin steel interface steel core interface and the skin core interface 4 numerical results and analysis 4 1 load deflection curve fig 11 shows the bending deflection contour of the joint under three point bending loading the load deflection curve of the simulation correlates well to test one fig 12 4 2 steel plate stress and initial softening as can be seen in fig 13 the maximum von mises stress region of the steel plate is located in the bottom surface near the joint s midspan during loading fig 14 shows the maximum stress time history curves of the steel plate when the displacement load rises to about 8 0 mm the maximum stress of the steel plate starts to exceed the yield strength of 393 4 mpa according to fig 12 the slope of the calculated load deflection curve began to decrease at this time so it can be inferred that the initial softening of the specimen is caused by the local yield of the steel plate 4 3 debonding analysis since the major failure modes of the joint consist of interfacial debonding shear failure and tension crack of the balsa core according to the test it is necessary to discuss the numerical calculation results of debonding state and stress field of the core according to the numerical results debonding first initiates at the tip of the edge of the steel core interface the exact position is circled in fig 15 then the scope of debonding initiation extends inside along the edge of the interface next debonding propagates along the slope of the steel core interface during the whole loading process debonding doesn t happen in skin steel and skin core interfaces 4 4 core stresses analysis fig 16 shows the contours of bending stress and shear stress of the core when the displacement load is about 11 2 mm a time before debonding initiation the maximum tensile stress of the core appears at the lower corner point on the interface adhesive to the steel plate by the end that tension critical point is pointed out in fig 16 a and represented by the abbreviation tcp in the following figures the maximum shear stress appears at the upper corner point on the same interface which is pointed out in fig 16 b and represented by the abbreviation scp below fig 17 shows the stress curves of the critical points it can be seen that the tension critical point tcp and shear critical point scp almost reach the strength values tensile strength 1 435 mpa and shear strength 3 0 mpa at the same time when the displacement load reaches around 9 0 mm in addition when the displacement load increased to about 12 mm the stresses curves of scp show a fluctuation corresponding to the calculated interface contact states result debonding initiates in the steel core interface at the same time and in the same location of the scp so it can be inferred that the core stress fluctuation is caused by the steel core interface debonding there 5 discussion it should be noted that due to the deviation between the cohesive parameter values of czm and the actual interface characteristics the calculated stresses of the materials near the interface have a certain deviation from the actual situation additionally the initiation time and propagation speed of interfacial debonding are also affected by the cohesive parameters deviation therefore the stress curves of the critical points can neither be used as the basis for judging the occurrence time of shear failure and tensile failure nor the sequences of several failure modes despite that when the same cohesive parameters were used in the following numerical simulation studies on the design improvement of the joint geometry the calculated stress and debonding results are still of reference and comparison significance on evaluating the improvement effect 6 joint design improvement schemes it can be seen both from the test results and from the fe simulation results that the failure critical zone of the hybrid butt joint is around the embedded end of the steel plate and the interface there part of the balsa core material is at a high stress level because of the stress concentration in this section three joint design improvement schemes are proposed each of them introduces minor adjustments to the geometry of the steel plate embedded end fe numerical simulations are carried out for the joints with the improved design schemes in the simulations the material properties cohesive parameters mesh densities contact settings and boundary conditions are the same as those adopted in the original joint s simulation the calculated results such as the stresses at the critical points and the bonding contact states are discussed to evaluate the improvement effect of each scheme on upgrading the bearing capacity of the joint 6 1 design improvement scheme 1 in the design improvement scheme 1 the upper inclined face of the steel plate in the embedded part is extended to the lower skin of the sandwich panel until a vertical distance of 1 mm fig 18 illustrates the geometry modification part of the joint fig 19 shows the contour of tensile stress and shear stress of the core at the displacement load of 11 2 mm the maximum tensile stress and the maximum shear stress of the core still appear at the corner of the embedded steel plate s end as shown in fig 20 the shear stress of the shear critical point scp in scheme 1 is significantly lower than the maximum shear stress of the original joint the shear stress in the linear stage is reduced by 37 0 additionally no debonding contact state appears through all interfaces during the whole loading process even when the displacement load is increased to 16 mm indicating that the improved joint design of scheme 1 can delay the debonding initiation 6 2 design improvement scheme 2 in the design improvement scheme 2 the embedded end of the steel plate is extended along the lower skin by a length of l fig 21 three values of l 1 0d 1 5d and 2 0d d is the thickness of the steel plate are considered corresponding fe models are set up to calculate and compare the improvement effect of different extension lengths on the stresses of critical points it can be seen in fig 22 b that the concentration of shear stress at the corner point of the core material is relieved fig 23 demonstrates the stress curves of the critical points for three extending lengths the shear stress curves for all extending lengths have significantly dropped compared with that of the original joint the reduction effect is the most desirable when l 1 5d and the shear stress in the linear stage is reduced by 37 0 coincidentally the same with design improvement scheme 1 although the tensile stress curves of the tension critical point tcp for three extended lengths are also declined compared with the original joint it is mainly resulted by the reduction of the bending moment at the section where the tcp is located besides debonding contact state has not appeared in all interfaces during the whole calculated loading process for three extending lengths inferring that the design improvement of scheme 2 also is capable of delaying the debonding initiation 6 3 design improvement scheme 3 in scheme 3 the embedded end of the steel plate is extended along the lower skin by a length of 1 5 times the plate thickness and chamfered by 45 fig 24 the contours of bending stress and shear stress of the core at the displacement load of 11 2 mm are shown in fig 25 the critical shear stress curve for scheme 3 declines by 40 2 compared to the curve for the original joint at the linear stage while the critical tension stress curve declines insignificantly see fig 26 debonding contact state has not appeared in all interfaces without exception that proves the improved scheme 3 can also delay the interfacial debonding initiation of the joint 6 4 comparison of the design modifications fig 27 shows the load deflection curves of the three joints with improved designs and the original joint the stiffness of the improved joints is almost identical to the original one as shown in fig 28 the shear stress of the balsa core at the critical point for scheme 3 has the most reduction among all schemes but the tensile stress increases slightly in scheme 1 and scheme 2 the reduction range of shear stress is the same which is slightly less than scheme 3 however scheme 1 has no obvious effect on the reduction of tensile stress while scheme 2 has a certain improvement effect on relieving tensile stress it is necessary to consider the cost of the manufacturing process and the mechanical properties of the core material to decide which joint improvement scheme is more efficient 7 conclusion in this paper a 3d nonlinear fe simulation has been carried out on the composite to steel butt joint under a three point bending load czm with bilinear traction separation law is adopted to simulate the debonding of the adhesively bonded interfaces adhesive property parameters of the interfaces are obtained by multiple calculation trials and comparing with the experimental results the simulation results show that the balsa core by the buried end of the steel plate is the critical region of the joint due to the stress concentration phenomenon the core material near the upper corner there bears the maximum shear stress and the lower corner bears the maximum bending tensile stress the debonding initiates from the steel core interface at the upper corner on the premise of not changing the general form of the joint and increasing the manufacturing cost three schemes for improving the design of the hybrid butt joint are proposed scheme 1 is to extend the upper inclined face of the steel plate in the embedded part towards the lower skin of the sandwich panel scheme 2 is to extend the embedded end of the steel plate along the lower skin by a length of 1 5 times of the steel plate thickness and scheme 3 is to extend the end of the steel plate along the skin and chamfer the end by 45 the numerical simulation results show that these three schemes can effectively reduce the shear stress concentration and improve the stress field of the critical zone these modifications can delay the interfacial debonding and the strength failure of the core and they increase the bearing

a cohesive zone model is adopted to simulate interfacial debonding of the joint cohesive property parameters of the interfaces are obtained by multiple calculations and comparisons with experimental results three schemes for improving the design of the joint are proposed the numerical simulation results of the improvement schemes based on the cohesive parameters obtained before indicate that these three schemes can effectively relieve the shear stress concentration and improve the stress field on the critical region thus delaying the interfacial debonding and the core strength failure thus increasing the bearing capacity of the joint keywords composite to steel joint cohesive interface interfacial debonding numerical simulation 1 introduction with the development of ship industry towards high speed lightweight and large scale fibre reinforced plastic frp material has been studied and applied more and more in this field due to many advantages such as high stiffness lightweight and easy maintenance smith 1990 mouritz et al 2001 barsotti et al 2020 several analyses of ships in composite materials have been conducted looking at components chen and guedes soares 2007a gaiotti and rizzo 2012 kolanu et al 2016 shen et al 2017a b hirwani and panda 2018 towsend et al 2018 xie et al 2018 and the hull behaviour chen and guedes soares 2008 2011 sobey et al 2013a including their reliability guedes soares 1997 jeong and shenoi 1998 chen et al 2003 chen and guedes soares 2007b c sobey et al 2013b yangdas et al 2013 nowadays frp laminates or sandwich composite structures are also introduced in large ships as non load bearing members such as pedestal mast propellers but also as secondary bearing members such as superstructure transverse bulkhead and local decks li et al 2015 gaiotti et al 2018 kharghani and guedes soares 2018 2019 kharghani et al 2019 for the application of large composite components in steel hull vessels it is an essential task to ensure the reliability and economy of the connection between the composite material and the metal structure regarding joining composite substructures to the metal ship structure adhesive or bolted joints or a combination of these two are the only options as to bolt connection the manufacturing process of the joints tends to be complicated when the number of bolts is large thus reducing the production efficiency adhesive connection offers a long list of advantages compared to others the main advantages of adhesive joining are the reduction of the weight of the structure and the superior flexibility in joining dissimilar materials which enable in sequence the designer to choose the most fitting material for each part of the structure nevertheless it is difficult even impossible to implement adhesive connections in the shipbuilding shop because the temperature humidity and cleanliness of the environment are difficult to meet adhesive quality requirements even if structural adhesive tolerant to process conditions is selected in the construction the building process will bring challenges to the efficiency and quality of the ship structures the preferable solution is to prefabricate the composite steel joint components in a suitable working environment and then weld the joint component on the steel part to the hull in the yard shop without additional work for effective integration of composite parts into the metallic structure of a ship the composite to metal joints should fulfil some basic principles and requirements such as mechanical behaviour production cost easy application and low maintenance in the past years some types of hull superstructure and hull bulkhead composite steel joints have been presented and their mechanical or other behaviour has been verified by tests and numerical approaches hentinen et al 1997 developed four joint concepts for joining large frp sandwich parts to metal structures in which the overlaminate joint concept is confirmed to have higher static strength than the bolted joint and the adhesively bonded concept is more cost efficient reducing the manufacturing costs during the joining to the ship by as much as 50 wright et al 2000 examined the structural performance of a symmetric steel to composite bonded joint by experiments and numerical predictions in which the steel part bonded over the laminate bohlmann and fogarty 2002 report on a project to demonstrate the feasibility of building part of the superstructure of a us navy destroyer in composite material many different joint configurations and concepts to join two different materials were evaluated and a hybrid bolt adhesive joint was chosen mcgeorge et al 2003 developed a bonded tuning fork type joint offering some mechanical interlocking an ageing programme was undertaken to improve the confidence in the long term performance of the joints mcgeorge 2005 this study is relevant as it is known that composite materials subject to contact with water degrade their properties alizadeh et al 2021 alizadeh and guedes soares 2021 cao et al 2003 2004 evaluated two concepts of joints a bonded bolted joint and a co infused perforated joint the joints are used on hybrid ships consisting of an advanced double hull stainless steel centre section to which a composite material bow and or stern is attached edison welding institute ewi at which cao et al are affiliated demonstrated an adhesive bonding method to join composite to steel for the deckhouse of large ship structures boyd et al 2004 2007 2008 studied an asymmetric joint through the use of a parametric variation of the geometric variables and genetic algorithms to search the design space for optimal solutions that will have a benefit to the performance of the joint under compressive loading yang et al 2011 report the finite element model development for assisting the design of a bonded joint system for a composite steel interface experimental results for the adhesive were published by ritter et al 2009 and speth et al 2010 together with fea results kharghani and guedes soares 2015a studied a composite to steel joint made of two plate channel that serve as external supports of the sandwich plate by a numerical approach the attachment of the steel joint to the structure is supported by a bracket this joint is used on a large scale hybrid composite steel balcony overhang of ships later small scale and large scale specimens of the joint were tested under imposed shear and bending loads to investigate its behaviour kharghani et al 2018 kharghani and guedes soares 2018 the mechanical properties of the sandwich panel and its skin were further compared before and after failure kharghani and guedes soares 2019 kotsidis et al 2015a investigated the influence of various geometry design parameters on the mechanical behaviour of a similar asymmetric sandwich composite steel joint under tensile and bending loads by numerical approach and presented a preferable size design of the joint static and fatigue tests were executed later to investigate the behaviour of that joint in tension loading kotsidis et al 2015b kharghani et al 2019 performed a three point bending test on the hybrid joint of the same geometry and size as in kotsidis et al 2015a clifford et al 2002 examined the mechanical response of an asymmetric joint between a glass fibre reinforced plastic gfrp material superstructure and a steel hull the adhesively bonded butt joint is comprised of a steel panel and a gfrp sandwich panel with the gfrp part bonded over the steel part the objective of this paper is to put forward the improvement schemes of the adhesively bonded composite to steel butt joint which has been defined through an earlier fe parametric study kotsidis et al 2015a and studied by fe simulation and tests kharghani et al 2019 in this paper a 3d nonlinear numerical model is set up to simulate the deflection stress fields and interfacial debonding of the hybrid joint under three point bending load contact elements with a cohesive zone model czm are adopted to simulate the adhesive interface between different materials cohesive parameters of the czm are obtained by repeated calculations to reconcile the numerical results to the experimental ones subsequently three design improvement schemes are proposed to relieve the stress concentration of the joint and upgrading its load capacity numerical simulations of the developed joints which adopt the cohesive parameters obtained before are carried out to verify the upgrading effects of the improved design schemes 2 synthesis of experimental test results 2 1 specimen geometry and manufacturing the geometry of the specimens without and with the reinforcing bolt is presented in fig 1 the adhesively bonded butt joint consists of a double lap steel frp part plus an frp sandwich part designed to connect a steel plate and a sandwich panel one end of the steel plate is folded to 15 and embedded into the core of the sandwich panel the top and bottom skins of the sandwich extend to the steel part as the double lap of the joint all interfaces between different materials are bonded only by vinylester resin during the manufacturing of the prefabricated joint the thicknesses of the core steel and skins are 30 10 and 2 5 mm respectively the length of the inclined steel inside the sandwich core is approximately 75 mm kharghani et al 2019 each size of the joint is derived from the previous research conclusion kotsidis et al 2015 the width of all specimens is equal to 100 mm fig 2 shows the views of the joint specimen the sandwich skins consisted of four layers of biaxial stitched e glass fabric together with crystic ve679pa vinylester resin the core of the sandwich is made of pro balsa standard wood 155 kg m3 from portugal whereas the steel panel is of ah36 grade the whole joint was formed by a resin infusion process with the vacuum bagging method at estaleiros navais de peniche sa shipyard 2 2 experimental set up the hybrid joint specimens were installed on the calibrated servo hydraulic mechanical test machine for a three point bending loading test fig 3 and fig 4 respectively show the test configuration and the locations of constraints and load the detailed information about the specimens and the test are presented in kharghani et al 2019 which will not be repeated here 2 3 experimental test results there are three specimens without bolts and four with one bolt in the middle width of the steel laminate sandwich part in the test program fig 5 presents the load deflection curves of the two types of specimens the curves slopes of these two types which represent the bending stiffness of the joints show no differences the bolts have been designed mainly to avoid any type of separation under tension load the position of the bolt is far from the local areas of damage initiation and propagation when the joint is in bending condition the experimental test results show that the bolt does not influence the joint s mechanical response under bending load therefore these two types are no longer distinguished in this paper fig 6 shows the seven failed specimens in the test it can be observed that the failure types of the specimens include core shear failure core tensile failure debonding on the steel core interface and debonding on the skin core interface however no eye visible failure indications were observed on the specimens surface during the loading process until the specimen suddenly collapsed completely and lost its bearing capacity it seems that all types of failure occurred at the same time during the frame of the captured movie the failure sequences of mentioned modes can t be distinguished by the test 3 fe analysis 3 1 element types material properties and boundary conditions all composite steel butt joint models in this paper are constructed using ansys mechanical apdl 18 0 software a 3 d 20 node structural solid element is adopted in the analysis namely solid186 this type of element is available in two forms one is homogeneous structural solid which is selected to stimulate the steel panel and the balsa wood core and the other is layered structural solid which is selected to stimulate the top and bottom skins of the joint uniform reduced integration technology is adopted for this element in the analysis the element section for the skin is defined as 4 layers with orthogonal anisotropy and linear elasticity properties of the biaxial stitched e glass fabric material elastic plastic material property with bilinear isotropic hardening criteria is applied to the steel panel and linear orthogonal anisotropy is applied to the core the material mechanical parameters are listed in table 1 figs 6 and 7 show the fe model of the joint with the boundary conditions and the local mesh of the critical zone it can be seen that the elements near the folded corner and the buried end of the steel plate were prone to debond are denser than in other places 3 2 boundary conditions a simple support constraint is applied to the joint on the lower surface nodes of the constraint section of both ends the nodes on one end are constrained by three displacement degrees of freedom while those on the other end are constrained by displacement degrees in vertical and width directions in the loading section the upper surface nodes are coupled in vertical displacement and a vertical displacement load of 16 mm is applied to the primary node which lies in the middle of the width of the section see fig 7 the positions of the constraint section and loading section are consistent with the test see fig 4 3 3 czm method and bilinear traction separation law cohesive zone models czm are widely adopted in delamination and debonding failure simulations the cohesive law i e the traction separation law is implemented in czm to infer the failure mechanism of the adhesive layer of the interface it is the constitutive relation between the traction p acting on the interface and the corresponding interfacial separation u n displacement jump across the interface the bilinear traction separation law proposed by alfano and crisfield 2001 is embedded in the ansys software and adopted in this study fig 8 it shows a linear elastic loading oa followed by a linear softening ac see fig 9 debonding is initiated at point a when the traction achieves the maximum traction stress σ m a x and completed when the traction goes back to zero at point c the slope of the first line k is the initial stiffness of the interface determining the separations u at the maximum traction σ m a x u c is the interface separation when the debonding is completed the area under the curve oac is the released energy due to debonding it is called the critical fracture energy g c which is equal to the fracture toughness of the interface and satisfies the following relation 1 g c 1 2 σ m a x u c the bilinear traction separation law for every debonding mode can be determined by three cohesive parameters initial stiffness k peak traction σ m a x or τ m a x and fracture toughness g c g c can be determined by conducting standard fracture mechanics experiments godani et al 2014 alizadeh and guedes soares 2019 where σ max and τ m a x are material parameters related to the length of the process zone and the tensile strength of the interface material but they are not easily measurable and their values are generally estimated by experiments alfano 2006 the initial stiffness k is often assumed as a high penalty parameter so that there exists an often wide range of values for k which both ensure a good prediction of the undamaged behaviour of the interface and avoid ill conditioning alfano 2006 zou et al 2002 based on their own experience proposed a value for the interface stiffness between 104 and 107 times the value of the interfacial strength per unit length using cohesive elements it is necessary to have a sufficient number of elements in the cohesive zone to capture the correct distribution of tensions the critical dimension of the finite element is along the crack propagation path studies have shown that element number between 2 and 5 was sufficient to predict the propagation of delamination which leads to very fine meshes in the delamination front turon et al 2007 gave guidelines to simulate delamination with coarser meshes the calculated cohesive zone length was increased when adopting lower interface traction values then the element size was increased with the demanded element numbers besides alfano and crisfield 2001 observed that variations of the maximum interfacial strength do not have a strong influence on the predicted results but that lowering the interfacial strength can improve the convergence rate of the solution the interfacial debonding of the hybrid butt joint belongs to the mix mode type so cohesive parameters for mode i and mode ii are both needed in the calculation detailed cohesive parameters adopted in this study are listed in table 2 in which the fracture toughnesses g c are adopted the experimental values in lee et al 2010 the interface peak tractions are determined according to equation 2 the relation between the interlaminar strengths was proposed by turon et al 2010 which ensure a correct energy dissipation when delamination propagates with cohesive elements under mixed mode fracture 2 τ m a x σ m a x g i i c g i c in this study the interfaces between different materials are simulated by bonded contact pairs an interface is composed of a contact surface and a target surface in the overlapped position which are simulated with the contact elements conta174 and target elements targe170 respectively both surfaces are defined with bilinear czm constitutive behaviours fig 10 shows the contact elements in the skin steel interface steel core interface and the skin core interface 4 numerical results and analysis 4 1 load deflection curve fig 11 shows the bending deflection contour of the joint under three point bending loading the load deflection curve of the simulation correlates well to test one fig 12 4 2 steel plate stress and initial softening as can be seen in fig 13 the maximum von mises stress region of the steel plate is located in the bottom surface near the joint s midspan during loading fig 14 shows the maximum stress time history curves of the steel plate when the displacement load rises to about 8 0 mm the maximum stress of the steel plate starts to exceed the yield strength of 393 4 mpa according to fig 12 the slope of the calculated load deflection curve began to decrease at this time so it can be inferred that the initial softening of the specimen is caused by the local yield of the steel plate 4 3 debonding analysis since the major failure modes of the joint consist of interfacial debonding shear failure and tension crack of the balsa core according to the test it is necessary to discuss the numerical calculation results of debonding state and stress field of the core according to the numerical results debonding first initiates at the tip of the edge of the steel core interface the exact position is circled in fig 15 then the scope of debonding initiation extends inside along the edge of the interface next debonding propagates along the slope of the steel core interface during the whole loading process debonding doesn t happen in skin steel and skin core interfaces 4 4 core stresses analysis fig 16 shows the contours of bending stress and shear stress of the core when the displacement load is about 11 2 mm a time before debonding initiation the maximum tensile stress of the core appears at the lower corner point on the interface adhesive to the steel plate by the end that tension critical point is pointed out in fig 16 a and represented by the abbreviation tcp in the following figures the maximum shear stress appears at the upper corner point on the same interface which is pointed out in fig 16 b and represented by the abbreviation scp below fig 17 shows the stress curves of the critical points it can be seen that the tension critical point tcp and shear critical point scp almost reach the strength values tensile strength 1 435 mpa and shear strength 3 0 mpa at the same time when the displacement load reaches around 9 0 mm in addition when the displacement load increased to about 12 mm the stresses curves of scp show a fluctuation corresponding to the calculated interface contact states result debonding initiates in the steel core interface at the same time and in the same location of the scp so it can be inferred that the core stress fluctuation is caused by the steel core interface debonding there 5 discussion it should be noted that due to the deviation between the cohesive parameter values of czm and the actual interface characteristics the calculated stresses of the materials near the interface have a certain deviation from the actual situation additionally the initiation time and propagation speed of interfacial debonding are also affected by the cohesive parameters deviation therefore the stress curves of the critical points can neither be used as the basis for judging the occurrence time of shear failure and tensile failure nor the sequences of several failure modes despite that when the same cohesive parameters were used in the following numerical simulation studies on the design improvement of the joint geometry the calculated stress and debonding results are still of reference and comparison significance on evaluating the improvement effect 6 joint design improvement schemes it can be seen both from the test results and from the fe simulation results that the failure critical zone of the hybrid butt joint is around the embedded end of the steel plate and the interface there part of the balsa core material is at a high stress level because of the stress concentration in this section three joint design improvement schemes are proposed each of them introduces minor adjustments to the geometry of the steel plate embedded end fe numerical simulations are carried out for the joints with the improved design schemes in the simulations the material properties cohesive parameters mesh densities contact settings and boundary conditions are the same as those adopted in the original joint s simulation the calculated results such as the stresses at the critical points and the bonding contact states are discussed to evaluate the improvement effect of each scheme on upgrading the bearing capacity of the joint 6 1 design improvement scheme 1 in the design improvement scheme 1 the upper inclined face of the steel plate in the embedded part is extended to the lower skin of the sandwich panel until a vertical distance of 1 mm fig 18 illustrates the geometry modification part of the joint fig 19 shows the contour of tensile stress and shear stress of the core at the displacement load of 11 2 mm the maximum tensile stress and the maximum shear stress of the core still appear at the corner of the embedded steel plate s end as shown in fig 20 the shear stress of the shear critical point scp in scheme 1 is significantly lower than the maximum shear stress of the original joint the shear stress in the linear stage is reduced by 37 0 additionally no debonding contact state appears through all interfaces during the whole loading process even when the displacement load is increased to 16 mm indicating that the improved joint design of scheme 1 can delay the debonding initiation 6 2 design improvement scheme 2 in the design improvement scheme 2 the embedded end of the steel plate is extended along the lower skin by a length of l fig 21 three values of l 1 0d 1 5d and 2 0d d is the thickness of the steel plate are considered corresponding fe models are set up to calculate and compare the improvement effect of different extension lengths on the stresses of critical points it can be seen in fig 22 b that the concentration of shear stress at the corner point of the core material is relieved fig 23 demonstrates the stress curves of the critical points for three extending lengths the shear stress curves for all extending lengths have significantly dropped compared with that of the original joint the reduction effect is the most desirable when l 1 5d and the shear stress in the linear stage is reduced by 37 0 coincidentally the same with design improvement scheme 1 although the tensile stress curves of the tension critical point tcp for three extended lengths are also declined compared with the original joint it is mainly resulted by the reduction of the bending moment at the section where the tcp is located besides debonding contact state has not appeared in all interfaces during the whole calculated loading process for three extending lengths inferring that the design improvement of scheme 2 also is capable of delaying the debonding initiation 6 3 design improvement scheme 3 in scheme 3 the embedded end of the steel plate is extended along the lower skin by a length of 1 5 times the plate thickness and chamfered by 45 fig 24 the contours of bending stress and shear stress of the core at the displacement load of 11 2 mm are shown in fig 25 the critical shear stress curve for scheme 3 declines by 40 2 compared to the curve for the original joint at the linear stage while the critical tension stress curve declines insignificantly see fig 26 debonding contact state has not appeared in all interfaces without exception that proves the improved scheme 3 can also delay the interfacial debonding initiation of the joint 6 4 comparison of the design modifications fig 27 shows the load deflection curves of the three joints with improved designs and the original joint the stiffness of the improved joints is almost identical to the original one as shown in fig 28 the shear stress of the balsa core at the critical point for scheme 3 has the most reduction among all schemes but the tensile stress increases slightly in scheme 1 and scheme 2 the reduction range of shear stress is the same which is slightly less than scheme 3 however scheme 1 has no obvious effect on the reduction of tensile stress while scheme 2 has a certain improvement effect on relieving tensile stress it is necessary to consider the cost of the manufacturing process and the mechanical properties of the core material to decide which joint improvement scheme is more efficient 7 conclusion in this paper a 3d nonlinear fe simulation has been carried out on the composite to steel butt joint under a three point bending load czm with bilinear traction separation law is adopted to simulate the debonding of the adhesively bonded interfaces adhesive property parameters of the interfaces are obtained by multiple calculation trials and comparing with the experimental results the simulation results show that the balsa core by the buried end of the steel plate is the critical region of the joint due to the stress concentration phenomenon the core material near the upper corner there bears the maximum shear stress and the lower corner bears the maximum bending tensile stress the debonding initiates from the steel core interface at the upper corner on the premise of not changing the general form of the joint and increasing the manufacturing cost three schemes for improving the design of the hybrid butt joint are proposed scheme 1 is to extend the upper inclined face of the steel plate in the embedded part towards the lower skin of the sandwich panel scheme 2 is to extend the embedded end of the steel plate along the lower skin by a length of 1 5 times of the steel plate thickness and scheme 3 is to extend the end of the steel plate along the skin and chamfer the end by 45 the numerical simulation results show that these three schemes can effectively reduce the shear stress concentration and improve the stress field of the critical zone these modifications can delay the interfacial debonding and the strength failure of the core and they increase the bearing

20262,this paper investigates the safety guaranteed formation control problem for marine surface vehicles msvs with unknown environment disturbances model uncertainties and output constraints initially by employing the prescribed performance method to ensure that the position tracking errors are converged to the specified range then a new barrier lyapunov function blf is incorporated into the formation control algorithm to guarantee that the states satisfy the constraints furthermore by using an adaptive radial basis function neural network rbfnn to approximate the unknown nonlinear function an adaptive rbfnn finite time output constrained formation control law is proposed based on the backstepping design method on this basis in order to greatly reduce the update rate of the controller and mechanical loss of the actuator the relative threshold event triggered mechanism is introduced into the design of formation controller the formation controller will be updated if and only if event triggered conditions are satisfied subsequently the stability analysis demonstrates that all error signals of the closed loop system can converge into a small neighborhood around zero in finite time under the proposed method meanwhile the prescribed bounds on the tracking errors will never be violated and it is proved by theory that the zeno behavior can be avoided finally numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation controller keywords marine surface vehicles formation control prescribed performance barrier lyapunov function event triggered control finite time convergence 1 introduction with the increasingly fierce competition for marine resources in the economic military and other fields the formation control technology of marine surface vehicles msvs has been developed rapidly 10 15 18 due to the advantages of wide operation range high efficiency and good fault tolerance the msvs formation control has been widely used in navigation replenishment marine exploration and maritime patrol 3 4 at the same time it has been highly valued by researchers at home and abroad in recent several papers many control methods have been proposed to achieve the desired formation such as leader follower method 30 virtual structure method 26 and behavior based control method 19 in recent years there are several challenges for msvs formation control three of which will be considered in this work the first challenge is the safe control problem of msvs it can also be understood as the constraint problem of some state variables for the formation control in addition to achieving the desired formation collision avoidance should be considered in the navigation process typical techniques for solving constraint problems include prescribed performance function method model predictive control method barrier lyapunov function blf method reference setting method and so on in zhao et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 and chen et al 2019 blf methods were used to study the system with full state constraints in zhao et al 2014 the output constraints problem of msvs was studied and a symmetric blf was developed to handle the position tracking error in zheng et al 2017 authors proposed an asymmetry time varying blf to solve the problem of trajectory tracking control of full auvs with input and output asymmetric constraints for euler lagrange systems a controller based on tan type blf was developed in chen et al 2019 to guarantee that error variables would not exceed the predefined bounds in jin 2018 and jin 2019 tan type blf and universal blf were designed for a unified solution to handle systems with or without constraints zheng and feroskhan 2017 proposed a formation controller based on prescribed performance taking into account both steady state and temporary state performance in addition while ensuring the stable operation of the system it is usually necessary to consider performance indicators such as convergence rate maximum overshoot and steady state error therefore it is very important to combine blf with prescribed performance in the design process of controller it is noteworthy that in practical application most controllers collect system states and update the actuator states at each sampling instant which may lead to unnecessary energy waste and actuator wear due to the frequent updates of actuator for the above reasons event triggered control etc mechanism has attracted more and more attention because of its typical practical application advantages the etc mechanism means that only when a certain event occurs the states of msv s controller will be updated obviously this control method greatly avoids frequent triggering of msvs actuator and reduces the wear of actuator in recent years some researches on the applications of etc for msvs were studied in zhao et al 2017 gao and guo 2018 ge and han 2017 and wang et al 2019 in order to save communication resources event triggered based controller was proposed in zhao et al 2017 which effectively reduces the update of the controller in addition a novel sufficient criterion with less conservatism was presented to exclude the zeno behavior a fixed time leader follower formation controller for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with event triggered acoustic communications was proposed in gao and guo 2018 in ge and han 2017 authors proposed an event triggered control law to solve the problem of distributed formation control with limited communication resources in addition for the time varying formation control problem an event triggered integral sliding mode control strategy was proposed in wang et al 2019 which not only saves energy consumption but also avoids zeno behavior in these articles the idea of the fixed threshold etc mechanism is used for the fixed threshold etc mechanism no matter how the control signal changes the event triggered threshold always remains unchanged however the dynamic event triggered threshold is more appropriate in the control system specifically when the value of the control signal in the system changes greatly the event triggered threshold can be set larger so that the control signal will remain unchanged for a long time when the system state approaches the equilibrium state the amplitude change of the control signal will be smaller and more precise control is needed to ensure the stable performance of the system so a smaller event triggered threshold should be used therefore a relative threshold etc mechanism is proposed in this paper the last issue is that the convergence rate of the msvs formation control system the formation control schemes introduced above only guaranteed the asymptotic stability of the closed loop system which implies that exact convergence cannot be guaranteed in finite time in contrast finite time controller has the superiority of faster convergence rate higher control precision and better anti interference performance which can heighten the dynamic property and insure the finite time stability of the closed loop system therefore combining a series of control algorithms such as sliding mode control smc 14 state feedback control 27 and added power integration method 22 with finite time control algorithms the finite time controller has been widely applied in amin et al 2019 the finite time position tracking and heading tracking control problems were studied a backstepping controller based on fast terminal smc was presented to make the system have finite time convergence combining with the novel smc method a distributed controller for formation control of underactuated msvs was designed in li et al 2018 which can achieve the desired formation control in finite time in liu et al 2017 a finite time adaptive tracking control law was designed for msvs with uncertainties and external disturbances therefore this paper incorporates the fast power approach law into the design of the controller which speeds up the convergence rate of tracking error and realizes the finite time stability of controller inspired by the above mentioned observations an adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation control scheme is designed to solve the safety guaranteed formation control problem of msvs under the consideration of unknown environment disturbances model uncertainties and output constraints the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 compared with the existing methods to deal with the error constraints the advantage of this paper is that the prescribed performance method and blf method are considered simultaneously so as to obtain the smaller transient error and the smaller steady state error a novel blf method is proposed to solve the error constraint problem it is universal and simple and it is also applicable to other error constrained problem or output constrained problem 2 in contrast to the event triggered method in zhao et al 2017 gao and guo 2018 ge and han 2017 and wang et al 2019 the relative threshold etc mechanism is incorporated into the formation controller the threshold of this etc mechanism is dynamic which not only improves the control performance of the formation control system but also improves the engineering feasibility in practical application and it also effectively reduces the update frequency of the controller and the mechanical loss of the actuator 3 different from the formation control methods in wang et al 2020 and fu et al 2018 the proposed adaptive rbfnn finite time formation control law can tackle the unknown nonlinear function and improve the convergence rate of tracking error by combining rbfnn with fast power approach law the rest of this paper is organized as follows the preliminaries and problem formulation are introduced in section 2 in section 3 an adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation control scheme is designed for msvs the stability of the formation control system is analyzed in section 4 numerical simulation results are given and analyzed in section 5 finally the conclusion is drawn in section 6 2

with d n r n lemma 1 xia et al 2019 suppose that there is a positive definite continuous lyapunov function v x t defined on u 1 r n of the origin and 2 v x t c 1 v x t c 2 v α x t x u 1 0 where c 1 0 c 2 0 and 0 α 1 then the origin of system 1 is locally finite time stable and the settling time can be given by t ln 1 c 1 c 2 v 1 α x 0 t 0 c 1 c 1 α 2 2 graph theory in the formation control of msvs the network communication relationship is generally described by graph theory consider the network system composed of n msvs and the communication structure is described by undirected graph a single msv is regarded as a node and the information exchange path between msvs is represented by an undirected edge then the information communication relationship of the msvs can be mapped to a graph with nodes and edges define an undirected connected weighted graph g g v ɛ where v 1 n denotes the set of nodes and ɛ v v denotes the set of edges if the edges between any two nodes are undirected then g is called an undirected graph the adjacency matrix a a i j r n n associated with g is defined as a i j 0 if i j ɛ otherwise a i j 0 the laplacian matrix l l i j r n n is defined as l i j a i j i j j 1 j i n a i j i j which is a symmetric matrix in addition the interaction among msvs is depicted by g b diag b 1 b n is defined as the adjacency matrix where b i 0 if the ith msv can receive the leader information otherwise b i 0 lemma 2 hong et al 2016 if g is connected then the matrix l b associated with g is symmetric and positive definite 2 3 approximation of rbfnn in this paper an adaptive rbfnn is proposed to approximate the unknown nonlinear function f x induced by unknown environment disturbances and model uncertainties the rbfnn can be used to approximate it over a compact set ω x as follows 3 f x w t h x c where x denotes the input vector with x ω x r m c denotes the approximation error and c c w is the weight vector of the hidden unit to output layer defined as 4 w arg min w sup x ω x f x w t h x and h x h 1 x h 2 x h l x t is the basis function vector and it can be expressed as follows 5 h i x exp x u i 2 σ i 2 i 1 2 l where u i u i 1 u i 2 u i m t is the center vector for the hidden unit σ i is the width for the gaussian function m is the dimension of input state x and l is the node number of hidden neurons 2 4 event triggered control mechanism for the general time triggered formation control scheme the state signals are transmitted to the controller at a fixed sampling interval and the controller is updated regularly however this periodic transmission may increase the mechanical loss of the controller and fuel consumption therefore for limited fuel resources or engineering applications the time triggered formation control strategy is not desirable inspired by xing et al 2017 the etc mechanism is applied to formation control system which reduces the controller update and save fuel resources in the etc mechanism of system event triggered conditions need to be set in advance whenever the system state satisfies the event triggered conditions the event is triggered and the controller will be updated at this time which is also known as the current event triggered time when the states of the system do not satisfy the event triggered conditions the controller will keep the value at the value generated at the moment of the last event triggered under the action of a zero order hold until the next update that is 6 u t u t k t t k t k 1 where t k k 1 2 denotes an event triggered sequence therefore the etc mechanism can reduce the controller update so as to effectively reduce the actuator loss and save energy remark 1 in the etc mechanism there may be zeno behavior zeno behavior means that etc mechanism is triggered infinitely during the running time of the control system that is to say the trigger time interval is infinitely short obviously this case is not feasible therefore when designing the control system based on etc mechanism it is necessary to calculate the minimum trigger interval of etc mechanism to prove that there is no zeno behavior in the system 2 5 mathematical model the mathematical model of the ith msv i 1 2 3 can be described as follows 7 η i r ψ i ν i m i ν i c i ν i ν i d i ν i ν i g i ν i τ i τ w i where η i x i y i ψ i t represents the position x i y i t and the heading angle ψ i of the ith msv respectively ν i u i v i r i t represents the surge velocity u i sway velocity v i and yaw rate r i of the ith msv respectively r ψ i cos ψ i sin ψ i 0 sin ψ i cos ψ i 0 0 0 1 is the rotation matrix from the body fixed frame to the earth fixed inertial frame the earth fixed inertial frame and body fixed frame are depicted by fig 1 m i m i t m 11 m 12 m 13 m 21 m 22 m 23 m 31 m 32 m 33 c i ν i c

τ v i τ r i t denotes the control force and moment of the ith msv τ w i denotes the time varying environment disturbances in order to design the formation controller the mathematic model of msvs will be converted into another form by deriving the first equation in 7 we can get 8 ν i r 1 ψ i η i r ψ i l r i r 1 ψ i η i where l r i 0 r i 0 r i 0 0 0 0 0 l t r i substituting 8 into 7 yields 9 m i η i η i c i η i η i η i d i η i η i η i τ i τ w i where m i η i r ψ i m i r 1 ψ i c i η i η i r ψ i c i ν i m i r 1 ψ i r ψ i l r i r 1 ψ i d i η i η i r ψ i d i ν i r 1 ψ i τ i r ψ i τ i τ w i r ψ i τ w i in the design of control system considering that the coriolis centripetal force matrix c i ν i and damping coefficient matrix d i ν i are difficult to obtain accurately in practice there are model uncertainties in c i ν i and d i ν i let δ c i ν i and δ d i ν i denote the unknown uncertain parts caused by hydrodynamic damping and unmodeled dynamics which can be expressed as follows 10 c i ν i c i ν i δ c i ν i 11 d i ν i d i ν i δ d i ν i therefore the mathematical model 9 can be rewritten as follows 12 m i η i η i c i η i η i η i d i η i η i η i τ i ρ i t where c i η i η i r ψ i c i ν i r 1 ψ i d i η i η i r ψ i d i ν i r 1 ψ i ρ i t τ w i r ψ i δ c i ν i δ d i ν i r 1 ψ i η i are recorded as compound disturbances includes the model uncertainties and time varying environment disturbances define μ i η i the mathematical model of the ith msv can be transformed as follows 13 η i μ i μ i m i η i 1 c i η i η i η i d i η i η i η i τ i ρ i t considering the mathematical model of the ith msv 13 in the presence of unknown environment disturbances and model uncertainties the control objectives of this paper is to design an adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation controller such that i the msvs track the desired path in finite time and all error signals of the whole closed loop control system can converge into a small neighborhood around zero in finite time ii the position error not only meets the specified performance but also satisfies the constraint requirements before the formation controller design we make the assumptions as follows assumption 1 the compound disturbances ρ i t is unknown but bounded which satisfies the following inequality ρ i t ρ 0 where ρ 0 denotes the upper bound of ρ i t assumption 2 the desired trajectory η d x d y d ψ d t is a smooth function and η d η d η d are bounded 3 formation controller design in this section an adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation controller is designed for msvs under the consideration of model uncertainties and unknown environment disturbances the whole design process is divided into three steps in the first step the virtual control law is constructed by combining the prescribed performance and blf then the actual formation control law is designed in the second step in the last step the relative threshold event triggered condition is given step 1 the position tracking error for each msv is defined as follows 14 e 1 i t x i η d η i r ψ i ψ 0 i l i η d where x i is the reference point for each msv in the formation l i x 0 i y 0 i ψ 0 i t r 3 π ψ 0 i π represents the structure vector of each msv which is used to control the position of each msv in the formation define the position synchronization error between adjacent msvs as 15 z 1 i t j n i a i j e 1 i t e 1 j t in order to improve the control accuracy and synchronization performance among msvs the position cross coupling error e 1 i t is defined by using the position tracking error and position synchronization error 16 e 1 i t j n i a i j e 1 i t e 1 j t b i e 1 i t where a i j and b i are defined in section 2 2 then taking the time derivative of e 1 i t it yields 17 e 1 i t d b i μ i d b i r ψ i l r i l i j n i a i j μ j b i η d j n i a i j r ψ j l r j l j the specified performance can be described by the following inequality 18 δ min ζ t e 1 i t δ max ζ t t 0 where δ max and δ min are adjustable parameters ζ t is a performance function which is bounded and strictly monotonically decreasing and 19 ζ t ζ 0 ζ e β t ζ where β ζ 0 and ζ are all positive constants and ζ 0 ζ 0 select the appropriate parameter ζ 0 to make ζ 0 ζ δ min ζ 0 e 1 i 0 δ max ζ 0 in order to satisfy the specified performance the following transformation is carried out 20 e 1 i t ζ t φ i ϖ i t t 0 where φ i ϖ i t δ max e ϖ i t δ min e ϖ i t e ϖ i t e ϖ i t ϖ i t is the transformation error since the function φ i ϖ i t is strictly monotonic increasing and φ i ϖ i t 2 δ max δ min e ϖ i t e ϖ i t 2 0 then we can get that 21 ϖ i t φ i 1 e 1 i t ζ t 1 2 ln φ i δ min δ max φ i its derivative is 22 ϖ i t γ i e 1 i t ζ t ζ t e 1 i t where γ i 1 2 ζ t 1 φ i δ min 1 φ i δ max the coordinate transformation is defined as follows 23 s i t ϖ i t 1 2 ln δ min δ max taking the time derivative of s i t we obtain 24 s i t γ i e 1 i t ζ t ζ t e 1 i t next the time varying blf is introduced to address the error constraints as follows 25 v 1 1 2 χ i 2 χ i k c s i t k c s i t where k c is time varying error constraint it is obvious that χ i 0 if and only if s i t 0 which is the minimum value of s i t furthermore when s i t k c there is χ i hence v 1 it also means that s i t will not exceed the constraint k c as long as v 1 is bounded remark 2 if there is no constraint on s i t which is equivalent to k c then li m k c χ i s i t v 1 1 2 s i 2 t this means that the system without the error constraint requirement it can actually be regarded as a special case of a general discussion on the constraint requirement thus 25 is called the universal blf remark 3 although the log type blf proposed by tee et al 2011 is an effective method to solve the problem of error constraints it cannot deal with constrained or unconstrained systems in a unified scheme in addition tan type blf from jin 2018 and blf from jin 2019 can simultaneously handle systems with or without constraints however these methods were relatively complex therefore it has been simplified and improved according to the characteristics of actual msvs by taking the time derivative of v 1 along 17

sig κ χ i sgn χ i χ i κ κ 0 1 where sgn χ i is the sign function step 2 in order to avoid the differential expansion of α f i the virtual control law α f i is passed through the first order low pass filter and the filtered control signal α d i is obtained as follows 28 t α d i α f i α d i sig κ α f i α d i α d i 0 α f i 0 where t is the time constant define the filtering error as follows 29 α e i α d i α f i taking the time derivative of 29 along 28 is given as 30 α e i α d i α f i α e i sig κ α e i t δ i where δ i α f i is a continuous function the velocity tracking error of each msv is

error and realize the finite time stability of the controller step 3 in this step in order to improve the control performance of the formation system a relative threshold etc mechanism is defined for the designed controller above according to 34 and 35 an adaptive rbfnn finite time relative threshold event triggered output constrained formation controller can be obtained as follows 37 ϕ i t 1 ι ω

will be kept constant by the zero order hold from the previous trigger time t k until the next trigger time t k 1 is updated in order to effectively reduce the update rate of controller and the mechanical loss of actuator the relative threshold etc mechanism can be defined as follows 39 τ i t ϕ i t k t t k t k 1 40 t k 1 inf t r ξ i t ι τ i t m 1 where t k is the update time of the formation controller 0 ι 1 m 1 0 m 1 m 1 1 ι ɛ 0 are all design parameters when the relative threshold etc mechanism 41 is violated the update time of the formation controller will be marked as t k 1 and the

uniformly ultimately bounded because v 1 v is bounded which implies that the error constraint requirements will never be violated during operation ii when v θ φ k 3 and 0 φ 1 we get θ φ k 3 v from 50 we have 51 v 1 φ k 3 v k 4 v g using lemma 1 it can be concluded that the formation control system will be stable to the region ω v v θ ψ k 3 in finite time and the settling time is 52 t 1 k 3 1 φ ln k 3 1 φ v 1 g 0 k 4 k 3 in addition for t t the position tracking error remain in a small neighborhood around zero in finite time remark 5 the existence of the signum function in the proposed formation control strategy will inevitably lead to high frequency chattering replacing the sign function in the formation control law with the saturation function can effectively reduce the chattering problem therefore the symbolic function in 35 is replaced by the following form 53 s a t e 2 i sign e 2 i e 2 i ɛ z 1 ɛ z r e 2 i e 2 i ɛ z where ɛ z 0 r 1 theorem 2 consider the formation control system consisting of a group of msvs described by 13 let assumptions 1 2 are hold the proposed adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation controller can make the minimum event triggered time interval t k 1 t k that is the event triggered adaptive output constrained formation controller will not have zeno phenomenon proof we proved that between any two trigger times in the system there exists a time interval t 0 satisfying k n t k 1 t k t from 38 it can be concluded that 54 d d t ξ i d d t ξ i ξ i 1 2 sign ξ i ξ i τ i t furthermore from 37 we obtain 55 τ i t 1 ι ω i

continuous function since all signals are globally bounded there must exists a constant 0 such that the condition ϕ i holds when t t k ξ i t k 0 and lim t t k 1 ξ i t ι τ i t m 1 therefore there must be a time interval t satisfies t ι τ i t m 1 π that is the zeno behavior will not occur in the system 5 simulation results in this section in order to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation control scheme the following numerical comparative simulation experiments are performed there are four msvs with the identical dynamics are considered to track the desired formation trajectory in this simulation an undirected connected graph communication topology is adopted between msvs and only 1 st msv can obtain the desired trajectory information the laplacian matrix l l i j 4 4 of the graph is defined as l 2 1 0 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 2 1 1 0 1 2 b diag 1 0 0 0 the communication topology graph is shown in fig 2 the model parameters of msvs are given as m 11 25 8 m 22 33 8 m 33 2 76 c 13 c 31 33 8 v i 1 01 r i c 23 c 32 25 8 u i d 11 0 93 d 22 2 89 d 33 0 5 the other elements are zero the initial position and heading angle of each msv are set as follows η 1 0 10 8 t η 2 30 8 1 0 t η 3 60 5 3 t η 4 90 7 1 0 t respectively the initial velocity of each msv are set as follows u i 0 0 m s v i 0 0 m s r i 0 0 r a d s respectively the structure vectors of each msv are set as follows l 1 0 0 0 t l 2 0 30 0 t l 3 0 60 0 t l 4 0 90 0 t respectively it is assumed that the coriolis matrix and the hydrodynamic damping matrix have 20 uncertainty relative to its nominal value namely δ c ν 0 2 c 0 ν δ d ν 0 2 d 0 ν the environment disturbances induced by wind waves and ocean currents are simulated as follows τ w t 2 sin 0 02 t 1 5 sin 0 1 t 2 sin 0 02 t 1 5 sin 0 3 t 2 sin 0 05 t 2 sin 0 1 t the formation controller parameters are taken as δ max 1 δ min 1 ζ t 14 97 e 0 3 t 0 03 k c 2 k 1 1 k 2 3 ι 0 001 m 1 3 m 1 0 1 σ i 0 1 ϑ 0 01 in this simulation the desired trajectory for the msvs formation is defined as follows 1 when t 200 s we choose 56 x t 2 t m y t 0 m 2 when 200 s t 500 s we choose 57 x t 1 2 t 1 30 sin 0 2 t t 1 m y t 30 30 cos 0 2 t t 1 m the simulation results are shown in figs 3 12 in which different msvs are described by different colors fig 3 shows the formation trajectories of the four msvs under the proposed adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation control scheme each msv can follow the desired formation and maintain the consistency of each other in order to further verify the superiority of the deigned controller comparisons with a traditional adaptive rbfnn controller 2 is made fig 4 and fig 5 show the position tracking errors under the proposed controller and the traditional adaptive rbfnn controller respectively it is clear that the position tracking errors under the proposed controller can converge into a small neighborhood around zero in finite time respectively fig 6 and fig 7 show the velocity tracking errors under the proposed controller and the traditional adaptive rbfnn controller respectively as it can be seen that the response curves in fig 6 has a faster convergence rate than in fig 7 and achieve higher steady state accuracy the comparison results can be observed that the four msvs can track the desired position with fast and precise tracking performance than the traditional adaptive rbfnn control scheme fig 8 shows the position tracking errors with specified performance it can be seen from fig 8 that the steady state error with specified performance is less than 0 03 therefore the steady state error of msvs consistent tracking control can be significantly reduced through specified performance transformation fig 9 and fig 10 show the event triggered time interval and event triggered times of four msvs respectively the event triggered times of the controllers of the four msvs in 500 s are 1525 times 3857 times 4020 times and 4957 times respectively the results show that the event triggered controller has the advantages of reducing the update number of controller and reducing the mechanical loss of actuator and there is no zeno behavior fig 11 shows the controller update number of 1 st msv under three different control schemes it can be seen that the proposed adaptive finite time relative threshold event triggered controller only needs to be updated 1525 times while in the adaptive finite time fixed threshold event triggered controller needs to be updated 3852 times and the controller needs to be updated 50003 times using the traditional adaptive nn control method in ge and wang 2002 therefore compared with the fixed threshold event triggered control and traditional time triggered control the relative threshold event triggered control method has obvious advantages in reducing the update number of controller in order to verify the approximation ability of rbfnn the approximation errors of rbfnn for unknown function including unknown environment disturbances and model uncertainties is shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the designed rbfnn adaptive control algorithm can efficiently approximate nonlinear function 6 conclusion in this paper an adaptive finite time event triggered output constrained formation controller based on prescribed performance and blf has been designed for msvs combining a rbfnn system and a relative threshold etc mechanism in the presence of unknown environment disturbances model uncertainties output constraints the position tracking errors are constrained to a prescribed region by introducing a prescribed performance method and blf into the backstepping procedure which considers both the transient error and the steady state error of formation control system furthermore the adaptive rbfnn method is adopted to handle the unknown environment disturbances and model uncertainties moreover the formation controller with the fast power approach law depends on the relative threshold etc mechanism is proposed compared with the traditional time triggered formation controller it not only can reduce the update rate of controller but also reduce the mechanical loss of actuator numerical comparative simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation controller credit authorship contribution

function an adaptive rbfnn finite time output constrained formation control law is proposed based on the backstepping design method on this basis in order to greatly reduce the update rate of the controller and mechanical loss of the actuator the relative threshold event triggered mechanism is introduced into the design of formation controller the formation controller will be updated if and only if event triggered conditions are satisfied subsequently the stability analysis demonstrates that all error signals of the closed loop system can converge into a small neighborhood around zero in finite time under the proposed method meanwhile the prescribed bounds on the tracking errors will never be violated and it is proved by theory that the zeno behavior can be avoided finally numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation controller keywords marine surface vehicles formation control prescribed performance barrier lyapunov function event triggered control finite time convergence 1 introduction with the increasingly fierce competition for marine resources in the economic military and other fields the formation control technology of marine surface vehicles msvs has been developed rapidly 10 15 18 due to the advantages of wide operation range high efficiency and good fault tolerance the msvs formation control has been widely used in navigation replenishment marine exploration and maritime patrol 3 4 at the same time it has been highly valued by researchers at home and abroad in recent several papers many control methods have been proposed to achieve the desired formation such as leader follower method 30 virtual structure method 26 and behavior based control method 19 in recent years there are several challenges for msvs formation control three of which will be considered in this work the first challenge is the safe control problem of msvs it can also be understood as the constraint problem of some state variables for the formation control in addition to achieving the desired formation collision avoidance should be considered in the navigation process typical techniques for solving constraint problems include prescribed performance function method model predictive control method barrier lyapunov function blf method reference setting method and so on in zhao et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 and chen et al 2019 blf methods were used to study the system with full state constraints in zhao et al 2014 the output constraints problem of msvs was studied and a symmetric blf was developed to handle the position tracking error in zheng et al 2017 authors proposed an asymmetry time varying blf to solve the problem of trajectory tracking control of full auvs with input and output asymmetric constraints for euler lagrange systems a controller based on tan type blf was developed in chen et al 2019 to guarantee that error variables would not exceed the predefined bounds in jin 2018 and jin 2019 tan type blf and universal blf were designed for a unified solution to handle systems with or without constraints zheng and feroskhan 2017 proposed a formation controller based on prescribed performance taking into account both steady state and temporary state performance in addition while ensuring the stable operation of the system it is usually necessary to consider performance indicators such as convergence rate maximum overshoot and steady state error therefore it is very important to combine blf with prescribed performance in the design process of controller it is noteworthy that in practical application most controllers collect system states and update the actuator states at each sampling instant which may lead to unnecessary energy waste and actuator wear due to the frequent updates of actuator for the above reasons event triggered control etc mechanism has attracted more and more attention because of its typical practical application advantages the etc mechanism means that only when a certain event occurs the states of msv s controller will be updated obviously this control method greatly avoids frequent triggering of msvs actuator and reduces the wear of actuator in recent years some researches on the applications of etc for msvs were studied in zhao et al 2017 gao and guo 2018 ge and han 2017 and wang et al 2019 in order to save communication resources event triggered based controller was proposed in zhao et al 2017 which effectively reduces the update of the controller in addition a novel sufficient criterion with less conservatism was presented to exclude the zeno behavior a fixed time leader follower formation controller for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with event triggered acoustic communications was proposed in gao and guo 2018 in ge and han 2017 authors proposed an event triggered control law to solve the problem of distributed formation control with limited communication resources in addition for the time varying formation control problem an event triggered integral sliding mode control strategy was proposed in wang et al 2019 which not only saves energy consumption but also avoids zeno behavior in these articles the idea of the fixed threshold etc mechanism is used for the fixed threshold etc mechanism no matter how the control signal changes the event triggered threshold always remains unchanged however the dynamic event triggered threshold is more appropriate in the control system specifically when the value of the control signal in the system changes greatly the event triggered threshold can be set larger so that the control signal will remain unchanged for a long time when the system state approaches the equilibrium state the amplitude change of the control signal will be smaller and more precise control is needed to ensure the stable performance of the system so a smaller event triggered threshold should be used therefore a relative threshold etc mechanism is proposed in this paper the last issue is that the convergence rate of the msvs formation control system the formation control schemes introduced above only guaranteed the asymptotic stability of the closed loop system which implies that exact convergence cannot be guaranteed in finite time in contrast finite time controller has the superiority of faster convergence rate higher control precision and better anti interference performance which can heighten the dynamic property and insure the finite time stability of the closed loop system therefore combining a series of control algorithms such as sliding mode control smc 14 state feedback control 27 and added power integration method 22 with finite time control algorithms the finite time controller has been widely applied in amin et al 2019 the finite time position tracking and heading tracking control problems were studied a backstepping controller based on fast terminal smc was presented to make the system have finite time convergence combining with the novel smc method a distributed controller for formation control of underactuated msvs was designed in li et al 2018 which can achieve the desired formation control in finite time in liu et al 2017 a finite time adaptive tracking control law was designed for msvs with uncertainties and external disturbances therefore this paper incorporates the fast power approach law into the design of the controller which speeds up the convergence rate of tracking error and realizes the finite time stability of controller inspired by the above mentioned observations an adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation control scheme is designed to solve the safety guaranteed formation control problem of msvs under the consideration of unknown environment disturbances model uncertainties and output constraints the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 compared with the existing methods to deal with the error constraints the advantage of this paper is that the prescribed performance method and blf method are considered simultaneously so as to obtain the smaller transient error and the smaller steady state error a novel blf method is proposed to solve the error constraint problem it is universal and simple and it is also applicable to other error constrained problem or output constrained problem 2 in contrast to the event triggered method in zhao et al 2017 gao and guo 2018 ge and han 2017 and wang et al 2019 the relative threshold etc mechanism is incorporated into the formation controller the threshold of this etc mechanism is dynamic which not only improves the control performance of the formation control system but also improves the engineering feasibility in practical application and it also effectively reduces the update frequency of the controller and the mechanical loss of the actuator 3 different from the formation control methods in wang et al 2020 and fu et al 2018 the proposed adaptive rbfnn finite time formation control law can tackle the unknown nonlinear function and improve the convergence rate of tracking error by combining rbfnn with fast power approach law the rest of this paper is organized as follows the preliminaries and problem formulation are introduced in section 2 in section 3 an adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation control scheme is designed for msvs the stability of the formation control system is analyzed in section 4 numerical simulation results are given and analyzed in section 5 finally the conclusion is drawn in section 6 2 preliminaries and problem formulation 2 1 preliminaries definition 1 bhat 2000 consider the following system 1 x t f x t where f d r n is continuous on an open neighborhood d r n of the origin and f 0 0 the origin is said to be a finite time stable equilibrium of 1 if there exists an open neighborhood n d of the origin and a function t n 0 0 called the settling time function such that the following statements hold i finite time convergence for every x 0 n 0 x t is defined on 0 t x x t n 0 for all t 0 t x and lim t t x x t 0 ii lyapunov stability for every open neighborhood u ɛ of 0 there exists an open subset u δ of n containing 0 such that for every x 0 u δ 0 x t u ɛ for all t 0 t x the origin is said to be a globally finite time stable equilibrium if it is a finite time stable equilibrium with d n r n lemma 1 xia et al 2019 suppose that there is a positive definite continuous lyapunov function v x t defined on u 1 r n of the origin and 2 v x t c 1 v x t c 2 v α x t x u 1 0 where c 1 0 c 2 0 and 0 α 1 then the origin of system 1 is locally finite time stable and the settling time can be given by t ln 1 c 1 c 2 v 1 α x 0 t 0 c 1 c 1 α 2 2 graph theory in the formation control of msvs the network communication relationship is generally described by graph theory consider the network system composed of n msvs and the communication structure is described by undirected graph a single msv is regarded as a node and the information exchange path between msvs is represented by an undirected edge then the information communication relationship of the msvs can be mapped to a graph with nodes and edges define an undirected connected weighted graph g g v ɛ where v 1 n denotes the set of nodes and ɛ v v denotes the set of edges if the edges between any two nodes are undirected then g is called an undirected graph the adjacency matrix a a i j r n n associated with g is defined as a i j 0 if i j ɛ otherwise a i j 0 the laplacian matrix l l i j r n n is defined as l i j a i j i j j 1 j i n a i j i j which is a symmetric matrix in addition the interaction among msvs is depicted by g b diag b 1 b n is defined as the adjacency matrix where b i 0 if the ith msv can receive the leader information otherwise b i 0 lemma 2 hong et al 2016 if g is connected then the matrix l b associated with g is symmetric and positive definite 2 3 approximation of rbfnn in this paper an adaptive rbfnn is proposed to approximate the unknown nonlinear function f x induced by unknown environment disturbances and model uncertainties the rbfnn can be used to approximate it over a compact set ω x as follows 3 f x w t h x c where x denotes the input vector with x ω x r m c denotes the approximation error and c c w is the weight vector of the hidden unit to output layer defined as 4 w arg min w sup x ω x f x w t h x and h x h 1 x h 2 x h l x t is the basis function vector and it can be expressed as follows 5 h i x exp x u i 2 σ i 2 i 1 2 l where u i u i 1 u i 2 u i m t is the center vector for the hidden unit σ i is the width for the gaussian function m is the dimension of input state x and l is the node number of hidden neurons 2 4 event triggered control mechanism for the general time triggered formation control scheme the state signals are transmitted to the controller at a fixed sampling interval and the controller is updated regularly however this periodic transmission may increase the mechanical loss of the controller and fuel consumption therefore for limited fuel resources or engineering applications the time triggered formation control strategy is not desirable inspired by xing et al 2017 the etc mechanism is applied to formation control system which reduces the controller update and save fuel resources in the etc mechanism of system event triggered conditions need to be set in advance whenever the system state satisfies the event triggered conditions the event is triggered and the controller will be updated at this time which is also known as the current event triggered time when the states of the system do not satisfy the event triggered conditions the controller will keep the value at the value generated at the moment of the last event triggered under the action of a zero order hold until the next update that is 6 u t u t k t t k t k 1 where t k k 1 2 denotes an event triggered sequence therefore the etc mechanism can reduce the controller update so as to effectively reduce the actuator loss and save energy remark 1 in the etc mechanism there may be zeno behavior zeno behavior means that etc mechanism is triggered infinitely during the running time of the control system that is to say the trigger time interval is infinitely short obviously this case is not feasible therefore when designing the control system based on etc mechanism it is necessary to calculate the minimum trigger interval of etc mechanism to prove that there is no zeno behavior in the system 2 5 mathematical model the mathematical model of the ith msv i 1 2 3 can be described as follows 7 η i r ψ i ν i m i ν i c i ν i ν i d i ν i ν i g i ν i τ i τ w i where η i x i y i ψ i t represents the position x i y i t and the heading angle ψ i of the ith msv respectively ν i u i v i r i t represents the surge velocity u i sway velocity v i and yaw rate r i of the ith msv respectively r ψ i cos ψ i sin ψ i 0 sin ψ i cos ψ i 0 0 0 1 is the rotation matrix from the body fixed frame to the earth fixed inertial frame the earth fixed inertial frame and body fixed frame are depicted by fig 1 m i m i t m 11 m 12 m 13 m 21 m 22 m 23 m 31 m 32 m 33 c i ν i c 11 c 12 c 13 c 21 c 22 c 23 c 31 c 32 c 33 and d i ν i d 11 d 12 d 13 d 21 d 22 d 23 d 31 d 32 d 33 represent the inertia matrix coriolis matrix and hydrodynamic damping matrix respectively τ i τ u i τ v i τ r i t denotes the control force and moment of the ith msv τ w i denotes the time varying environment disturbances in order to design the formation controller the mathematic model of msvs will be converted into another form by deriving the first equation in 7 we can get 8 ν i r 1 ψ i η i r ψ i l r i r 1 ψ i η i where l r i 0 r i 0 r i 0 0 0 0 0 l t r i substituting 8 into 7 yields 9 m i η i η i c i η i η i η i d i η i η i η i τ i τ w i where m i η i r ψ i m i r 1 ψ i c i η i η i r ψ i c i ν i m i r 1 ψ i r ψ i l r i r 1 ψ i d i η i η i r ψ i d i ν i r 1 ψ i τ i r ψ i τ i τ w i r ψ i τ w i in the design of control system considering that the coriolis centripetal force matrix c i ν i and damping coefficient matrix d i ν i are difficult to obtain accurately in practice there are model uncertainties in c i ν i and d i ν i let δ c i ν i and δ d i ν i denote the unknown uncertain parts caused by hydrodynamic damping and unmodeled dynamics which can be expressed as follows 10 c i ν i c i ν i δ c i ν i 11 d i ν i d i ν i δ d i ν i therefore the mathematical model 9 can be rewritten as follows 12 m i η i η i c i η i η i η i d i η i η i η i τ i ρ i t where c i η i η i r ψ i c i ν i r 1 ψ i d i η i η i r ψ i d i ν i r 1 ψ i ρ i t τ w i r ψ i δ c i ν i δ d i ν i r 1 ψ i η i are recorded as compound disturbances includes the model uncertainties and time varying environment disturbances define μ i η i the mathematical model of the ith msv can be transformed as follows 13 η i μ i μ i m i η i 1 c i η i η i η i d i η i η i η i τ i ρ i t considering the mathematical model of the ith msv 13 in the presence of unknown environment disturbances and model uncertainties the control objectives of this paper is to design an adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation controller such that i the msvs track the desired path in finite time and all error signals of the whole closed loop control system can converge into a small neighborhood around zero in finite time ii the position error not only meets the specified performance but also satisfies the constraint requirements before the formation controller design we make the assumptions as follows assumption 1 the compound disturbances ρ i t is unknown but bounded which satisfies the following inequality ρ i t ρ 0 where ρ 0 denotes the upper bound of ρ i t assumption 2 the desired trajectory η d x d y d ψ d t is a smooth function and η d η d η d are bounded 3 formation controller design in this section an adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation controller is designed for msvs under the consideration of model uncertainties and unknown environment disturbances the whole design process is divided into three steps in the first step the virtual control law is constructed by combining the prescribed performance and blf then the actual formation control law is designed in the second step in the last step the relative threshold event triggered condition is given step 1 the position tracking error for each msv is defined as follows 14 e 1 i t x i η d η i r ψ i ψ 0 i l i η d where x i is the reference point for each msv in the formation l i x 0 i y 0 i ψ 0 i t r 3 π ψ 0 i π represents the structure vector of each msv which is used to control the position of each msv in the formation define the position synchronization error between adjacent msvs as 15 z 1 i t j n i a i j e 1 i t e 1 j t in order to improve the control accuracy and synchronization performance among msvs the position cross coupling error e 1 i t is defined by using the position tracking error and position synchronization error 16 e 1 i t j n i a i j e 1 i t e 1 j t b i e 1 i t where a i j and b i are defined in section 2 2 then taking the time derivative of e 1 i t it yields 17 e 1 i t d b i μ i d b i r ψ i l r i l i j n i a i j μ j b i η d j n i a i j r ψ j l r j l j the specified performance can be described by the following inequality 18 δ min ζ t e 1 i t δ max ζ t t 0 where δ max and δ min are adjustable parameters ζ t is a performance function which is bounded and strictly monotonically decreasing and 19 ζ t ζ 0 ζ e β t ζ where β ζ 0 and ζ are all positive constants and ζ 0 ζ 0 select the appropriate parameter ζ 0 to make ζ 0 ζ δ min ζ 0 e 1 i 0 δ max ζ 0 in order to satisfy the specified performance the following transformation is carried out 20 e 1 i t ζ t φ i ϖ i t t 0 where φ i ϖ i t δ max e ϖ i t δ min e ϖ i t e ϖ i t e ϖ i t ϖ i t is the transformation error since the function φ i ϖ i t is strictly monotonic increasing and φ i ϖ i t 2 δ max δ min e ϖ i t e ϖ i t 2 0 then we can get that 21 ϖ i t φ i 1 e 1 i t ζ t 1 2 ln φ i δ min δ max φ i its derivative is 22 ϖ i t γ i e 1 i t ζ t ζ t e 1 i t where γ i 1 2 ζ t 1 φ i δ min 1 φ i δ max the coordinate transformation is defined as follows 23 s i t ϖ i t 1 2 ln δ min δ max taking the time derivative of s i t we obtain 24 s i t γ i e 1 i t ζ t ζ t e 1 i t next the time varying blf is introduced to address the error constraints as follows 25 v 1 1 2 χ i 2 χ i k c s i t k c s i t where k c is time varying error constraint it is obvious that χ i 0 if and only if s i t 0 which is the minimum value of s i t furthermore when s i t k c there is χ i hence v 1 it also means that s i t will not exceed the constraint k c as long as v 1 is bounded remark 2 if there is no constraint on s i t which is equivalent to k c then li m k c χ i s i t v 1 1 2 s i 2 t this means that the system without the error constraint requirement it can actually be regarded as a special case of a general discussion on the constraint requirement thus 25 is called the universal blf remark 3 although the log type blf proposed by tee et al 2011 is an effective method to solve the problem of error constraints it cannot deal with constrained or unconstrained systems in a unified scheme in addition tan type blf from jin 2018 and blf from jin 2019 can simultaneously handle systems with or without constraints however these methods were relatively complex therefore it has been simplified and improved according to the characteristics of actual msvs by taking the time derivative of v 1 along 17 and 24 it yields 26 v 1 χ i χ i χ i s i 2 k c k c s i 2 k c 2 k c s i 2 s i χ i s i 2 k c k c s i 2 k c 2 γ i e 1 i ζ ζ e 1 i k c s i 2 χ i s i 2 k c k c s i 2 k c 2 γ i k c s i 2 d b i μ i d b i r ψ

sig κ χ i sgn χ i χ i κ κ 0 1 where sgn χ i is the sign function step 2 in order to avoid the differential expansion of α f i the virtual control law α f i is passed through the first order low pass filter and the filtered control signal α d i is obtained as follows 28 t α d i α f i α d i sig κ α f i α d i α d i 0 α f i 0 where t is the time constant define the filtering error as follows 29 α e i α d i α f i taking the time derivative of 29 along 28 is given as 30 α e i α d i α f i α e i sig κ α e i t δ i where δ i α f i is a continuous function the velocity tracking error of each msv is

follows 33 v v 1 1 2 e 2 i t e 2 i 1 2 w i t σ i 1 w i 1 2 α e i t α e i by taking the time derivative of v we have 34 v v 1 e 2 i t e 2 i w i t σ i 1 w ˆ i α e i t α e i k 1 χ i 2 k c 2 χ i γ i d b i

function remark 4 the item sig κ χ i in 27 and the item sig κ e 2 i in 35 are fast power approach laws which are used in the design of the controller to accelerate the convergence rate of tracking error and realize the finite time stability of the controller step 3 in this step in order to improve the control performance of the formation system a relative threshold etc mechanism is defined for the designed controller above according to 34 and 35 an adaptive rbfnn finite time relative threshold event triggered output constrained formation controller can be obtained as follows 37 ϕ i t 1 ι ω

will be kept constant by the zero order hold from the previous trigger time t k until the next trigger time t k 1 is updated in order to effectively reduce the update rate of controller and the mechanical loss of actuator the relative threshold etc mechanism can be defined as follows 39 τ i t ϕ i t k t t k t k 1 40 t k 1 inf t r ξ i t ι τ i t m 1 where t k is the update time of the formation

continuous function since all signals are globally bounded there must exists a constant 0 such that the condition ϕ i holds when t t k ξ i t k 0 and lim t t k 1 ξ i t ι τ i t m 1 therefore there must be a time interval t satisfies t ι τ i t m 1 π that is the zeno behavior will not occur in the system 5 simulation results in this section in order to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation control scheme the following numerical comparative simulation experiments are performed there are four msvs with the identical dynamics are considered to track the desired formation trajectory in this simulation an undirected connected graph communication topology is adopted between msvs and only 1 st msv can obtain the desired trajectory information the laplacian matrix l l i j 4 4 of the graph is defined as l 2 1 0 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 2 1 1 0 1 2 b diag 1 0 0 0 the communication topology graph is shown in fig 2 the model parameters of msvs are given as m 11 25 8 m 22 33 8 m 33 2 76 c 13 c 31 33 8 v i 1 01 r i c 23 c 32 25 8 u i d 11 0 93 d 22 2 89 d 33 0 5 the other elements are zero the initial position and heading angle of each msv are set as follows η 1 0 10 8 t η 2 30 8 1 0 t η 3 60 5 3 t η 4 90 7 1 0 t respectively the initial velocity of each msv are set as follows u i 0 0 m s v i 0 0 m s r i 0 0 r a d s respectively the structure vectors of each msv are set as follows l 1 0 0 0 t l 2 0 30 0 t l 3 0 60 0 t l 4 0 90 0 t respectively it is assumed that the coriolis matrix and the hydrodynamic damping matrix have 20 uncertainty relative to its nominal value namely δ c ν 0 2 c 0 ν δ d ν 0 2 d 0 ν the environment disturbances induced by wind waves and ocean currents are simulated as follows τ w t 2 sin 0 02 t 1 5 sin 0 1 t 2 sin 0 02 t 1 5 sin 0 3 t 2 sin 0 05 t 2 sin 0 1 t the formation controller parameters are taken as δ max 1 δ min 1 ζ t 14 97 e 0 3 t 0 03 k c 2 k 1 1 k 2 3 ι 0 001 m 1

t 1 30 sin 0 2 t t 1 m y t 30 30 cos 0 2 t t 1 m the simulation results are shown in figs 3 12 in which different msvs are described by different colors fig 3 shows the formation trajectories of the four msvs under the proposed adaptive rbfnn finite time event triggered output constrained formation control scheme each msv can follow the desired formation and maintain the consistency of each other in order to further verify the superiority of the deigned controller comparisons with a traditional adaptive rbfnn controller 2 is made fig 4 and fig 5 show the position tracking errors under the proposed controller and the traditional adaptive rbfnn controller respectively it is clear that the position tracking errors under the proposed controller can converge into a small neighborhood around zero in finite time respectively fig 6 and fig 7 show the velocity tracking errors under the proposed controller and the traditional adaptive rbfnn controller respectively as it can be seen that the response curves in fig 6 has a faster convergence rate than in fig 7 and achieve higher steady state accuracy the comparison results can be observed that the four msvs can track the desired position with fast and precise tracking performance than the traditional adaptive rbfnn control scheme fig 8 shows the position tracking errors with specified performance it can be seen from fig 8 that the steady state error with specified performance is less than 0 03 therefore the steady state error of msvs consistent tracking control can be significantly reduced through specified performance transformation fig 9 and fig 10 show the event triggered time interval and event triggered times of four msvs respectively the event triggered times of the controllers of the four msvs in 500 s are 1525 times 3857 times 4020 times and 4957 times respectively the results show that the event triggered controller has the advantages of reducing the update number of controller and reducing the mechanical loss of actuator and there is no zeno behavior fig 11 shows the controller update number of 1 st msv under three different control schemes it can be seen that the proposed adaptive finite time relative threshold event triggered controller only needs to be updated 1525 times while in the adaptive finite time fixed threshold event triggered controller needs to be updated 3852 times and the controller needs to be updated 50003 times using the traditional adaptive nn control method in ge and wang 2002 therefore compared with the fixed threshold event triggered control and traditional time triggered control the relative threshold event triggered control method has obvious advantages in reducing the update number of controller in order to verify the approximation ability of rbfnn the approximation errors of rbfnn for unknown function including unknown environment disturbances and model uncertainties is shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the designed rbfnn adaptive control algorithm can efficiently approximate nonlinear function 6 conclusion in this paper an adaptive finite time event triggered output constrained formation controller based on prescribed performance and blf has been designed for msvs combining a rbfnn system and a relative threshold etc mechanism in the presence of unknown environment disturbances model uncertainties output constraints the position tracking errors are constrained to a prescribed region by introducing a prescribed performance method and blf into the backstepping procedure which considers both the transient error and the steady state error of formation control system furthermore the adaptive rbfnn method is adopted to handle the unknown environment disturbances and model uncertainties moreover the formation controller with the fast power approach law depends on the relative threshold etc mechanism is proposed compared with the traditional time triggered formation controller it not only can reduce the update rate of controller but also reduce the mechanical loss of actuator numerical comparative simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation controller credit authorship contribution

20263,in this note the path following issue of underactuated cable laying vessels is addressed from two aspects i e guidance and control by exploiting the hierarchical design a so called dual virtual ships layered dvsl guidance algorithm is proposed with two reference path generators in the first guidance layer the logical virtual ship lvs is used to programme the setpoints based reference path for cables based on the cable related geometrical derivation the corresponding ship s reference path can be obtained in the second layer and its smoothness can be guaranteed by the adaptive virtual ship avs for the control part a novel composite neural event triggered control algorithm is developed by taking the main engine revolution and the rudder as actual control inputs which are characterized by the practical measurability and the aperiodic update the radial basis function neural networks rbf nns are employed to deal with the model uncertainty and the approximation performance is improved with the aid of the serial parallel estimation model spem by fusing the robust neural damping technique only two adaptive parameters require to be updated which leads to a simpler controller with less computation burden besides the inputs dominated event triggered mechanism is introduced to release the communication traffic in the controller to actuator channel through the lyapunov stability analysis all signals in the closed loop system are guaranteed to be semi global uniformly ultimately bounded sguub and the existence of minimum inter event time is proved finally three simulation experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and the superiority of proposed algorithm keywords underactuated cable laying vessels path following dvsl guidance event triggered control actuator gain uncertainty 1 introduction over the past few years the path following control of underactuated vessels has attracted extensive attention due to its wide applications in the civil and military industries qiao and zhang 2020 zheng et al 2018 such as the oceanographic mapping marine research and rescue and ocean intelligent transportation from the engineering practice it is easily analyzed that the realization of intelligent cable laying operation relies on the advanced modeling guidance control integrated systems choi et al 2018 gao et al 2021 to the best of authors knowledge the related theoretical researches are still lacking in the existing literatures thus it is imperative to develop a set of practical and effective cable laying schemes that is of great significance for improving the cable laying operation efficiency for the guidance system it is responsible for generating the real time reference signals fossen 2011 e g the position and heading information in the existing literatures nie and lin 2019 sun et al 2020 the line of sight los algorithm has been widely investigated owing to its simplicity and intuitiveness form which it is proved that the los algorithm can provide the powerful guidance support in the straight path though the traditional los algorithm may loss its effectiveness when the cross track error goes beyond the guidance range lucia et al 2007 for this purpose the convergence principle is gradually incorporated into the original los guidance law to enhance its practicability nassim and chalhoub 2013 actually the guidance performance of los algorithm can be also improved by compensating the unknown sideslip induced by sway disturbances in liu et al 2016 a parameterized predictor is developed to estimate the time varying sideslip angle by constructing the finite time observer the identification performance of unknown sideslip angle is thus enhanced in qu et al 2020 note that fu et al 2012 has attempted to implement the cable laying operation via the los algorithm although the cable can be laid onto the desired path under the los guidance there exists the obvious laying overshoot because of the inertial dominated turning maneuver considering the conservativeness of los guidance the double layers logical dll guidance has been proposed in our previous work zhang et al 2020 to realize the autonomous cable laying operation in the proposed guidance the guidance performance in the straight curve path can be strictly guaranteed based on the piecewise planning principle though it is noted that there is little consideration on the smoothness of reference paths especially for the cable laying vessel that may increase the peak saturation risk of control forces moments when the ship crosses the turning point and such a concern has been also pointed out in liu 2019 as for the control unit it has the function of deriving required control orders to actuators around the nonlinear control of underactuated vehicle a large number of interesting results have been reported e g sliding mode control qiao and zhang 2019 elmokadem et al 2019 adaptive fuzzy neural control chen et al 2020 qin et al 2020 yu et al 2020 model predictive control li et al 2020b in zheng et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 lu et al 2018 liu et al 2017 and yang et al 2019 a series of robust adaptive path following controllers are designed based on the backstepping and the dynamic surface control dsc technique in these algorithms the system uncertainty is addressed by means of the neural networks nns approximation rule for merits of the minimum learning parameter mlp technique the nns weight vector is effectively compressed such that a concise control behavior can be obtained in shen et al 2020 to deal with a more practical case zhang et al 2019 developed a waypoints based path following control algorithm with the obstacle avoidance function for the possibility to improve the identification performance of nns a composite intelligent learning control algorithm is proposed in xu and sun 2018 and improved in xu et al 2019 where the serial parallel estimation model spem is designed to construct the composite nns learning law despite the above efforts note that the unknown control gain is ignored in the aforementioned results in gao and guo 2020 a finite time formation tracking control law is derived for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with unknown control directions by virtue of the nussbaum gain technique the unknown control gain is tackled and no prior knowledge of control inputs is required in zhang et al 2018 the actuator gain uncertainty is compensated by updating two gain related adaptive parameters which results in the fact that the two practical system inputs are derived that could facilitate the engineering applications of theoretical algorithms actually the ship s path following system is a networked closed loop system with a communication channel from the controller to the actuator with respect to the time triggered control all system information requires to be continuously transmitted that may lead to the communication jam since the communication channel suffers form the limited network bandwidth to release the communication pressure the event triggered control etc strategy has been extensively investigated in the existing literatures and many remarkable results have been obtained for uncertain nonlinear systems with different constraints huang et al 2020 mustafa et al 2019 in the field of marine cybernetics a static event triggering mechanism is designed in li et al 2020a and a finite time adaptive tracking controller is thus developed in ma et al 2020 huang et al 2021 the triggering condition is endowed with a time varying characteristic which generates a better control performance to achieve the co update of controller and adaptive estimator deng et al 2020 presented a model based triggering rule by reconstructing the system model dynamics different from the aforementioned triggering designs the proposed triggering mechanism aims to reduce the communication burden in the sensor to controller channel instead of the controller to actuator one motivated by the above observations a practical robust adaptive cable laying scheme is proposed for the cable laying vehicle which is implemented by using the dual virtual ships layered dvsl guidance and the composite neural event triggered control algorithm the main contributions of this note can be summarized as follows 1 based on the setpoints based cable laying practice the dvsl guidance algorithm is developed by combining the logical virtual ship lvs and the adaptive virtual ship avs in the first guidance layer the lvs is used to generate the setpoints based laying path for cables that can avoid the laying overshoot caused by the los guidance maneuver in fu et al 2012 meanwhile the corresponding ship s sailing reference path can be derived in the second guidance layer and its smoothness can be improved by introducing the avs which is helpful for alleviating the chattering phenomenon of control inputs ignored in zhang et al 2020 2 a novel composite neural event triggered control algorithm is proposed to implement the setpoints based cable laying operation by using the command filter technique the explosion of complexity problem inherent in the backstepping is solved and the related filter error is also removed to guarantee the steady state performance of controller besides the nns approximation technique is adopted to compensate the system model uncertainty and the nns identification performance is enhanced by incorporating the modified spem for merits of the robust neural damping technique only two gain related adaptive parameters are required to cope with the actuator s unknown gain which generates two practically measurable control variables main revolution and rudder owing to the inputs dominated event triggered mechanism the communication burden in the controller to actuator channel is significantly reduced which leads to a lower activating frequency for actuators 2 problem formulation 2 1

is equipped with single rudder and propeller in the existing literatures zeng et al 2018 lu et al 2018 the three degree of freedom 3dof model has been widely used for the controller design of marine robots by incorporating the marine servo system zhang and zhang 2015 an improved version of the traditional 3dof model can be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 where two measurable commands are taken as actual

w i d w i m i χ c i χ c i m i i u r remark 1 with respect to the cable laying vessel the underactuated 3dof model is adopted as the research plant fig 1 presents the lateral view of cable laying vessel obviously it is easily seen that there are only two main propulsion devices the propeller and rudder different form the common marine underactuated vehicles the cable generated loads require to be considered and included in the dynamics model 2 of cable laying vessel note that the cable resulted damping effects are quite small and can even be ignored when compared to the main thrust force moments produced by the ship s propulsion equipment based on the above analysis the cable caused loads in the surge and yaw orientation can be considered as zero i e χ c i 0 i u r assumption 1 the redefined ocean disturbances variable d w i and cable generated loads χ c i i u r are bounded satisfying d w i d w i and χ c i χ c i where d w i χ c i are unknown positive constants just for the theory analysis assumption 2 on the basis of the rigorous theoretical analysis in li et al 2008 the sway velocity v of underactuated ship is passive bounded assumption 3 fu et al 2012 the cable laying vessel submarine laying equipment and cable catenary are in the same longitudinal profile and the sailing speed of working boat is consistent with that of cable laying operation remark 2 in the practical engineering ocean disturbances are continually changing with finite energy and always bounded that can illustrate the rationality of assumption 1 besides the sway velocity of underactuated ship will be attenuated gradually under the hydrodynamic and the cable generated damping effects thus the passive bounded stability result in assumption 2 is also reasonable and tenable in the marine practice considering that the cable laying operation is usually performed at a low speed the reasonability of assumption 3 can be satisfied and such a claim has been also mentioned in fu et al 2012 2

cable laying operation and the main objective is to develop a practical cable laying scheme for the underactuated workboat such that 1 the cable can be accurately laid onto the setpoints based reference path in the presence of unknown disturbances and communication constraints 2 all signals in the closed loop system are guaranteed to be semi global uniformly ultimately bounded 3 dvsl guidance in view of the fact that the practical marine cable laying operation is implemented via the laying sample points the dvsl guidance is thus developed using the lvs and the avs fig 2 shows the guidance principle of dvsl guidance algorithm in the proposed guidance the lvs is responsible for generating the desired laying path of cables the function of the avs is to provide the smooth reference path for cable laying vehicles note that both path generators are ideal agents without considering their inertial and damping effects layer 1 by exploring the path separation principle in zhang and zhang 2015 the setpoints based cable laying trajectory can be split into the straight path s t r s k and curve one c u r s k in this way we can use the lvs 8 to accomplish the piecewise programming task of these paths 8 η c r η c ν c where η c x c y c ψ c t is the position vector of the lvs ν c u c v c r c t is the corresponding velocity vector r η c is the rotation matrix with the definition as eq 9 9 r η c cos ψ c sin ψ c 0 sin ψ c cos ψ c 0 0 0 1 for the straight path the user defined surge speed u c is assigned to the virtual ship to generate the related reference path while for the curve segment the virtual ship can achieve the auto turning with the dynamic turning angular velocity r c u c r k k 1 2 n it is noted that the calculation of r c depends on the size of turning radius where the real ship maneuvering performance and the real time path switching angle δ ϕ k need to be taken into consideration based on the maneuvering practice we design the detailed selection principle of turning radius as eq 10 by implementing the above design to each setpoint the desired laying path of cables can be obtained 10 r i r max if δ ϕ k π 2 r max r min δ ϕ i sign δ ϕ i π 2 if δ

vector of cable laying ship δ l t c 0 0 t under assumption 3 ψ s ψ c will hold obviously differentiating eq 11 yields eqs 12 and 13 12 η s r η s ν s with 13 r η s cos ψ s sin ψ s 0 sin ψ s cos ψ s 0 0 0 1 ν s u c l t c r c r c though it should be noted that the current reference path original reference path of cable laying vessel is not completely smooth due to the use of piecewise planning strategy that may lead to the abrupt jump of control forces moments liu 2019 for this purpose the avs is introduced to provide the improved reference signal for the cable laying vehicle eq 14 gives the kinematics expression of avs similar to that of lvs different from the lvs the avs is with the adaptive property that is its velocity can be automatically programmed based on the variation of tracking errors 14 η a r η a ν a where η a x a y a ψ a t and ν a u a v a r a t are the position vector and the velocity vector of avs respectively r η a is also a transformation matrix similar to 9 to achieve the desired convergence objective η a η s the velocity vector of avs can be programmed as 15 15 ν a r t η a k a e ν ˆ max tanh e ϱ e where e η s η a is the convergence error k a is the related control coefficient matrix ϱ e is a positive constant note that the reference velocity vector ν s satisfies the constraining condition as ν s ν max where ν max is a positive constant ν ˆ max is its estimation value and updated via the adaptive law 16 16 ν ˆ max γ a e t tanh e ϱ e k a v ˆ max v ˆ max 0 where γ a k a are positive design parameters theorem 1 for any initial conditions satisfying e 0 t e 0 γ a 1 ν max 2 0 ρ a with any ρ a 0 the avs 14 can converge to the reference path of cable laying ship under the proposed velocity controller 15 and the adaptive law 16 proof consider the lyapunov candidate function as 17 17 v 1 1 2 e t e 1 2 γ a ν max 2 according to r η s 1 eq 18 can be derived by differentiating eq 17 18 v 1 e t r η s ν s r η a ν a 1 γ a ν max ν ˆ max e r η s ν s e t

bounded stability can be proved by lim t v 1 ε 2 b that also means that all error signals in the closed loop system are bounded using the proposed velocity controller and the adaptive laws the designed avs can be guaranteed to converge to the desired path within small errors 4 formulation of the composite neural robust adaptive control algorithm with event triggered inputs with the framework of backstepping an improved composite neural adaptive control algorithm is developed by incorporating the event triggered mechanism where the unknown disturbances and the limited communication resource are fully investigated section 4 1 introduces the inputs dominated event triggered design section 4 2 presents the related controller derivation details 4 1 design of the inputs based event triggered mechanism motivated by the triggering idea in xing et al 2017 the inputs dominated event triggered mechanism is developed to reduce the communication burden in the controller to actuator channels in particular the triggering rule depends on the magnitude of control signals besides the measurable control variables the main engine revolution and the rudder angle are selected as the triggering operator due to the incorporation of the actuator servo system to facilitate the corresponding derivation one defines two immediate control variables in eq 27 27 n u n n n r δ the relative triggering protocol is defined as eq 28 28 n i t n w i t k i t t k i t k 1 i t k 1 i inf t t k i e i t κ i n i t σ i where n w i t i u r is the control law at the triggering instant e i t n w i t n i t denotes the triggering error κ is triggering coefficient satisfying 0 κ i 1 for the event triggered behavior the control command n i t will be updated and replaced with n w i t k 1 i once the triggering condition 26 is violated when the system is in the flow period i e t t k i t k 1 i the control signals will keep unchanged that also indicates that the trigger error inequality e i t κ i n i t σ i holds in the flow time based on the analysis in xing et al 2017 there exist two unknown constants θ 1 i t 1 1 θ 2 i t 1 1 to depict the error relationship as 29 29 n w i t n i t θ 1 i t κ i n i t θ 2 i t σ i correspondingly n i t can be rewritten as 30 30 n i t n w i t 1 θ 1 i t κ i θ 2 i t σ i 1 θ 1 i t κ i remark 3 compared to the result in xing et al 2017 the proposed event trigger mechanism takes the measurable actuator inputs as the triggering operator which is easy to be implemented in real world applications besides the triggering condition is characterized by the dynamic regulation that is the triggering threshold will vary with the real time size of control inputs that not only ensures the control performance but also reduces the unnecessary information transmission 4 2 controller design to facilitate the detailed introduction of proposed controller we firstly give the dvsl guidance based path following control framework in fig 3 the whole design procedure consists of two steps kinematics and kinetics errors stabilization step 1 at this step the main task is to stabilize the kinematics error between the real ship and the avs for this purpose one firstly constructs the kinematics error eq 31 according to fig 3 31 x e x a x y e y a y z e x e 2 y e 2 ψ e ψ r ψ where ψ r is the ship s azimuth angle relative to the avs eq 32 shows its calculation method in different situations 32 ψ r ψ r d if x e 0 π 2 if x e 0 and y e 0 π 2 if x e 0 and y e 0 ψ a if x e 0 and y e 0 where ψ r d 0 5 1 sgn x e sgn y e π arctan y e x e differentiating z e and ψ e produces 33 z e π α u u α u ψ e ψ r α r r α r where π 2 u sin 0 5 ψ e 2 v sin ψ e x a cos ψ r y a sin ψ r α u and α r are virtual control laws that will be designed later as for the conventional backstepping the virtual control signal requires to be repeatedly differentiated to obtain its analytical derivative which will lead to the explosion of complexity problem fortunately the command filter technique has been proposed to solve this problem yu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 the working principle is that let the virtual control signal pass into a second order filter eq 34 gives the differentiation equation of command filter β i and β i 2 are output signals satisfying β i 0 α i 0 and β i 2 0 0 χ i 0 is the natural frequency and ζ i 0 1 is the damping parameter when the system input α i satisfies the constraint condition the filter error β i α i can be adjusted to be small enough to guarantee the convergence performance of command filter 34 β i χ i β i 2 i u r β i 2 2 ζ i χ

of the actuator gain uncertainty model uncertainty and time varying external disturbances for this purpose the compensated kinetics error z i 2 i u r is firstly defined by eq 40 40 z i 2 β i f i ν s i

adaptive parameter ω ˆ i is designed and updated to compensate for the actuator gain uncertainty which is the estimation value of ω i m i 1 θ 1 i κ i g i by combining the immediate control law with

attention is put on the approximation accuracy of nns considering this point the spem is introduced to improve the corresponding approximation effects for uncertain ship dynamics the spem based

can obtain eq 58 58 v 2 ς 2 c v 2 0 ς 2 c exp 2 c t obviously v 2 is uniformly ultimately bounded satisfying lim t v 2 t ς 2 c that implies that all errors will converge to a small neighborhood of the origin under assumption 1 it is known from 31 and 38 that x y ψ are all bounded by combining the boundedness of s i 1 s i 2 i u r farrell et al 2009 accordingly the virtual control law α i is also bounded that can directly prove the boundedness of velocity variables u r based on 40 in addition the sway velocity v is passive bounded based on assumption 2 thus all signals in the closed loop system can be guaranteed to be sguub under the proposed algorithm according to eqs 51 and 58 we can obtain 59 z i 1 ς c 2 v 2 0 ς 2 c exp 2 c t therefore it is concluded that the compensated tracking errors will fall into and remain in a attractive compact set ω t z u 1 z r 1 ς c z r 1 ς c with t and the compact set can be decreased by increasing k z i 1 k z i 2 k p i ξ i γ i γ i i u r which is helpful for improving the tracking accuracy the proof is completed remark 4 although the large control gain can lead to a better tracking performance that will generate the unexpected control signals and may even destroy the system stability therefore there always exists a trade off between the control performance and the system stability in addition it is noted that the obtained closed loop stability is only semi global that is because the satisfactory approximation performance can be guaranteed only if the nns input vector remains in a suitable compact set actually how to obtain the global stability result is still an open problem in the existing researches that will be our research emphasis in the future 5 2 existence of the minimum inter event time in the proposed algorithm the event triggered control technique has been employed to release the network communication traffic in the controller to actuator channel though the zeno behavior may happen i e the defined event will be triggered infinitely in a finite time interval that made lead to the failure of designed event triggered mechanism in what follows we will show that there exists a positive constant t i satisfying k z t k 1 i t k i t i by recalling the definition of triggering measurement error we have 60 d d t e i d d t e i e i 1 2 sgn e i e i n w i through the lyapunov stability analysis it is proved that all signals in the closed loop system are sguub as a function of all bounded variables it can be inferred from 47 that n w i is differential and bounded so there must exist a positive constant ι i such that n w i ι i hold in addition it is easy to know that e i t k i 0 and lim t t k 1 i e i t σ i based on the above analysis it is concluded that the minimum inter event time must satisfy t i σ i ι i in this way the existence of minimum inter event time can be guaranteed and the zeno behavior can be thus effectively excluded 6 illustrative experiment to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm the illustrative experiments are carried out in the matlab platform including the comparative experiment and the cable laying experiment in the presence of the simulated ocean disturbances in the simulation test the long range patrol boat austal patrol 38 length overall l 38 2 m molded beam b 7 2 m is selected as the interesting plant which has been considered in do et al 2004 table 1 presents its detail model parameters 6 1 guidance comparison in this note an improved version of dll guidance i e dvsl guidance is proposed for the marine cable laying operation in order to stand out the superiority of the dvsl guidance we have organized the comparative experiment which consists of two parts part 1 is to highlight to the laying advantage of cables compared to the traditional los guidance part 2 is to introduce the sailing advantage of cable laying ships in comparison with the dll guidance part 1 to test the setpoint based cable laying performance of different guidance algorithms we have picked five sampling points to provide the cable laying reference s 1 0 m 0 m s 2 500 m 100 m s 3 600 m 700 m s 4 300 m 1200 m s 5 0 m 600 m note that the ideal virtual ship l 38 2 m is the actuating objective in this comparison where no inertial and damping effects are required to be considered the initial state of virtual ship is set as x c 0 y c 0 ψ c 0 0 m 0 m 0 rad and the guidance velocity is u c 5 m s for the proposed algorithm the turning radius is restricted in 2 l 5 l for the parameter details of los algorithm please refer to the reference literature fu et al 2012 in fig 4 a the laying trajectories of cables under three guidance laws are given although three approaches can accomplish the setpoints based cable laying task it should be noted that the dll and dvsl mechanisms own the larger cable laying coverage compared to the los algorithm especially in the sampling turning area that is exactly the advantage of the piecewise design strategy from fig 4 b it can be observed that the cable laying vessel requires the smaller turn under the dvsl guidance than the los algorithm and the reference path generated by the dvsl algorithm is with the smooth form by comparing with the dll mechanism for the quantity purpose we have performed the numerical calculation based on two interesting performance indexes i e the required length of cables rlc and the required voyage of cable laying ships rvs from the data comparison result in table 2 the proposed dvsl algorithm not only achieves the reasonable cable laying operation but also decreases the waste of valuable cables and cable laying ships resources part 2 as an improved version of dll guidance the dvsl algorithm can provide the smooth reference path for the cable laying ship actually such an improvement can effectively reduce the chattering phenomenon of control inputs when the ship is crossing the turning point to verify this view we have carried out the related experiment by comparing with the dll guidance in zhang et al 2020 following the previous method we just pick five sampling points to offer the laying reference i e s 1 0 m 200 m s 2 600 m 200 m s 3 900 m 800 m s 4 2300 m 800 m s 5 2000 m 1500 m in this experiment the proposed control approach is implemented by combining the dll and dvsl guidance respectively to clearly show the comparison result it is noted that the external disturbance is not considered in this test the initial position attitude and velocity state of ships are set as x 0 y 0 ψ 0 u 0 v 0 r 0 100 m 10 m 0 rad 0 m s 0 m s 0 rad s to obtain the satisfactory guidance and control performance the trial error strategy is adopted to select a set of appropriate design parameters as shown in eq 61 61 k z u 1 0 2 k z r 1 0 2 k z u 2 8 k z r 2 10

shown in figs 5 6 fig 5 depicts the laying trajectory of cables and the sailing trajectory of cable laying vessel under two guidance schemes although both guidance mechanisms can perform the cable laying task the resulted control inputs are with obvious differences in fig 6 the running curves of control signals are more smooth under the dvsl guidance algorithm especially at the turning points which can decrease the saturation risk and release the output pressure for marine actuators in conclusion the effectiveness and the superiority of dvsl guidance algorithm can be clearly demonstrated 6 2 control comparison in this experiment the control performance is the concerned research topic for this consideration the proposed algorithm is compared with the control approaches in zheng et al 2017 and zeng et al 2018 in the comparison the parameterized reference path is generated by the virtual ship with switched velocity for the straight path the surge velocity is set as u c 4 m s while for the curve one the turning angular velocity is given in 62 besides one employs the nonzero mean time varying disturbances as 63 to demonstrate the robustness of the controller 62 r c exp 0 005 t

i 5 i 1 2 l by adopting the trial error strategy we select a set of appropriate design parameters 64 to obtain the satisfactory control effects 65 iae q t 0 t q e d t q z ψ itae q t 0 t t q e d t q z ψ itce χ t 0 t t τ χ d t χ u r the final comparison results are shown in figs 7 9 fig 7 displays the ship s tracking trajectory under three controllers it can be easily observed from the enlarging details that the proposed controller owns the better tracking accuracy and response speed to further verify the control performance fig 8 gives the convergence curves of tracking errors clearly the proposed control algorithm is more competitive in the aspects of transient and steady state performance fig 9 displays the evolution curves of surge force τ u and yaw moment τ r form which it is easily seen that the control signals under the proposed control algorithm can fall quickly and remain into the steady range τ u n 1 1 0 5 3 1 0 5 τ r n m 1 1 0 8 3 1 0 8 based on the above analysis the superiority of proposed algorithm can be well illustrated to further reveal the control performance of three algorithms three popular indexes 65 are used for the quantified verification including the integrated absolute error iae the integrated time absolute error itae and the integrated time control energy itce itae and iae are used to describe the transient and steady state control performance respectively itce indicates the energy consumption ability of controllers the quantified comparison result is shown in table 3 obviously the smaller values for three indexes can be obtained under the proposed algorithm that implies that the proposed mechanism owns the better transient and steady performance without extra energy consumption to indicate the computation and communication performance of proposed algorithm some critical indexes i e computer s occupied memory and control triggered times are utilized to evaluate the computation and communication ability of controllers the detailed experiment data is listed on table 4 to minimize the randomness as much as possible we have ran 5 tests around memory usage on personal computers with different configurations from the mean held memory it can be seen that the proposed controller leads to the smaller memory usage compared to the results in zheng et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 which benefits from the robust neural damping technique in addition the effectiveness of proposed event triggered mechanism can be illustrated according to the triggering index compared with the time driven controllers in zheng et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 the updating frequency of actuators is significantly reduced under the proposed event triggered control law and the communication traffic in the controller to actuator channel is thus greatly released 6 3 simulated cable laying experiment in order to prove the practicability of proposed cable laying scheme fig 10 the setpoints based cable laying experiment is carried out in this subsection for this consideration the following five laying sample points are selected to supply the setpoints based laying reference i e s 1 0 m 200 m s 2 600 m 200 m s 3 900 m 800 m s 4 2300 m 800 m s 5 2000 m 1500 m in the experiment the marine environment is simulated by referring to the physical based mathematical model as shown in fig 11 the norsok wind and the pierson moscowitz pm wave

mean wind direction is set as ψ wind 30 deg for the parameters details of proposed guidance and control algorithms the reader can refer to the previous experiment part 2 in guidance comparison fig 12 describes the cable laying ship s navigation trajectory and resulted cable s laying result obviously the cable can be laid accurately on the setpoints based desired path even in the presence of ocean disturbances form fig 13 the control commands are characterized by the aperiodic computation and update that can verify the effectiveness of proposed event triggering mechanism fig 14 shows the evolution curves of adaptive parameters where the fast convergence can be achieved within 10 s that attributes to the incorporation of prediction error fig 15 presents the time interval between two adjacent triggering points form which it is calculated that the triggering times are only 832 compared to the time driven control mechanisms in zheng et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 a great quantify of communication resources will be saved under the proposed algorithm in general the effectiveness of proposed cable laying scheme can be preliminary illustrated via the above simulation experiment though the practical feasibility of theoretical algorithms under the real environment still needs further verification using a real ship or scaled mode 7 conclusion in this paper the path following issue of underactuated cable laying ship has been addressed from two aspects guidance and control by using the lvs and the avs the dvsl guidance is developed to provide the smooth reference paths for the cable and cable laying ship furthermore an improved composite neural robust control algorithm is proposed by combining the backstepping and the command filter technique we employed the rbf nns to approximate the model uncertainty and the approximation performance is enhanced via the modified spem the unknown actuator gain is compensated by two adaptive parameters and two practical control variables are derived by incorporating the event triggered strategy a great quantity of communication resources in the controller to actuator channel are thus saved a series of simulation experiments have verified the superiority and theoretical feasibility of proposed scheme in the practical engineering the actuators may suffer from the gradual or abrupt failures that will degrade the system

20263,in this note the path following issue of underactuated cable laying vessels is addressed from two aspects i e guidance and control by exploiting the hierarchical design a so called dual virtual ships layered dvsl guidance algorithm is proposed with two reference path generators in the first guidance layer the logical virtual ship lvs is used to programme the setpoints based reference path for cables based on the cable related geometrical derivation the corresponding ship s reference path can be obtained in the second layer and its smoothness can be guaranteed by the adaptive virtual ship avs for the control part a novel composite neural event triggered control algorithm is developed by taking the main engine revolution and the rudder as actual control inputs which are characterized by the practical measurability and the aperiodic update the radial basis function neural networks rbf nns are employed to deal with the model uncertainty and the approximation performance is improved with the aid of the serial parallel estimation model spem by fusing the robust neural damping technique only two adaptive parameters require to be updated which leads to a simpler controller with less computation burden besides the inputs dominated event triggered mechanism is introduced to release the communication traffic in the controller to actuator channel through the lyapunov stability analysis all signals in the closed loop system are guaranteed to be semi global uniformly ultimately bounded sguub and the existence of minimum inter event time is proved finally three simulation experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and the superiority of proposed algorithm keywords underactuated cable laying vessels path following dvsl guidance event triggered control actuator gain uncertainty 1 introduction over the past few years the path following control of underactuated vessels has attracted extensive attention due to its wide applications in the civil and military industries qiao and zhang 2020 zheng et al 2018 such as the oceanographic mapping marine research and rescue and ocean intelligent transportation from the engineering practice it is easily analyzed that the realization of intelligent cable laying operation relies on the advanced modeling guidance control integrated systems choi et al 2018 gao et al 2021 to the best of authors knowledge the related theoretical researches are still lacking in the existing literatures thus it is imperative to develop a set of practical and effective cable laying schemes that is of great significance for improving the cable laying operation efficiency for the guidance system it is responsible for generating the real time reference signals fossen 2011 e g the position and heading information in the existing literatures nie and lin 2019 sun et al 2020 the line of sight los algorithm has been widely investigated owing to its simplicity and intuitiveness form which it is proved that the los algorithm can provide the powerful guidance support in the straight path though the traditional los algorithm may loss its effectiveness when the cross track error goes beyond the guidance range lucia et al 2007 for this purpose the convergence principle is gradually incorporated into the original los guidance law to enhance its practicability nassim and chalhoub 2013 actually the guidance performance of los algorithm can be also improved by compensating the unknown sideslip induced by sway disturbances in liu et al 2016 a parameterized predictor is developed to estimate the time varying sideslip angle by constructing the finite time observer the identification performance of unknown sideslip angle is thus enhanced in qu et al 2020 note that fu et al 2012 has attempted to implement the cable laying operation via the los algorithm although the cable can be laid onto the desired path under the los guidance there exists the obvious laying overshoot because of the inertial dominated turning maneuver considering the conservativeness of los guidance the double layers logical dll guidance has been proposed in our previous work zhang et al 2020 to realize the autonomous cable laying operation in the proposed guidance the guidance performance in the straight curve path can be strictly guaranteed based on the piecewise planning principle though it is noted that there is little consideration on the smoothness of reference paths especially for the cable laying vessel that may increase the peak saturation risk of control forces moments when the ship crosses the turning point and such a concern has been also pointed out in liu 2019 as for the control unit it has the function of deriving required control orders to actuators around the nonlinear control of underactuated vehicle a large number of interesting results have been reported e g sliding mode control qiao and zhang 2019 elmokadem et al 2019 adaptive fuzzy neural control chen et al 2020 qin et al 2020 yu et al 2020 model predictive control li et al 2020b in zheng et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 lu et al 2018 liu et al 2017 and yang et al 2019 a series of robust adaptive path following controllers are designed based on the backstepping and the dynamic surface control dsc technique in these algorithms the system uncertainty is addressed by means of the neural networks nns approximation rule for merits of the minimum learning parameter mlp technique the nns weight vector is effectively compressed such that a concise control behavior can be obtained in shen et al 2020 to deal with a more practical case zhang et al 2019 developed a waypoints based path following control algorithm with the obstacle avoidance function for the possibility to improve the identification performance of nns a composite intelligent learning control algorithm is proposed in xu and sun 2018 and improved in xu et al 2019 where the serial parallel estimation model spem is designed to construct the composite nns learning law despite the above efforts note that the unknown control gain is ignored in the aforementioned results in gao and guo 2020 a finite time formation tracking control law is derived for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with unknown control directions by virtue of the nussbaum gain technique the unknown control gain is tackled and no prior knowledge of control inputs is required in zhang et al 2018 the actuator gain uncertainty is compensated by updating two gain related adaptive parameters which results in the fact that the two practical system inputs are derived that could facilitate the engineering applications of theoretical algorithms actually the ship s path following system is a networked closed loop system with a communication channel from the controller to the actuator with respect to the time triggered control all system information requires to be continuously transmitted that may lead to the communication jam since the communication channel suffers form the limited network bandwidth to release the communication pressure the event triggered control etc strategy has been extensively investigated in the existing literatures and many remarkable results have been obtained for uncertain nonlinear systems with different constraints huang et al 2020 mustafa et al 2019 in the field of marine cybernetics a static event triggering mechanism is designed in li et al 2020a and a finite time adaptive tracking controller is thus developed in ma et al 2020 huang et al 2021 the triggering condition is endowed with a time varying characteristic which generates a better control performance to achieve the co update of controller and adaptive estimator deng et al 2020 presented a model based triggering rule by reconstructing the system model dynamics different from the aforementioned triggering designs the proposed triggering mechanism aims to reduce the communication burden in the sensor to controller channel instead of the controller to actuator one motivated by the above observations a practical robust adaptive cable laying scheme is proposed for the cable laying vehicle which is implemented by using the dual virtual ships layered dvsl guidance and the composite neural event triggered control algorithm the main contributions of this note can be summarized as follows 1 based on the setpoints based cable laying practice the dvsl guidance algorithm is developed by combining the logical virtual ship lvs and the adaptive virtual ship avs in the first guidance layer the lvs is used to generate the setpoints based laying path for cables that can avoid the laying overshoot caused by the los guidance maneuver in fu et al 2012 meanwhile the corresponding ship s sailing reference path can be derived in the second guidance layer and its smoothness can be improved by introducing the avs which is helpful for alleviating the chattering phenomenon of control inputs ignored in zhang et al 2020 2 a novel composite neural event triggered control algorithm is proposed to implement the setpoints based cable laying operation by using the command filter technique the explosion of complexity problem inherent in the backstepping is solved and the related filter error is also removed to guarantee the steady state performance of controller besides the nns approximation technique is adopted to compensate the system model uncertainty and the nns identification performance is enhanced by incorporating the modified spem for merits of the robust neural damping technique only two gain related adaptive parameters are required to cope with the actuator s unknown gain which generates two practically measurable control variables main revolution and rudder owing to the inputs dominated event triggered mechanism the communication burden in the controller to actuator channel is significantly reduced which leads to a lower activating frequency for actuators 2 problem formulation 2 1

robots by incorporating the marine servo system zhang and zhang 2015 an improved version of the traditional 3dof model can be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 where two measurable commands are taken as actual

χ c v denote the tension forces in the surge and sway orientations respectively χ c r denotes the twisting moment in the yaw orientation g u and g r are unknown actuator gain functions zhang and zhang 2015 due to the fact that the actuator s energy gains are strictly positive and finite there exist positive constants g i g i i u r satisfying g i g i g i τ u and τ r are the surge force and the yaw moment respectively n and δ are measurable control inputs i e the main engine revolution and the rudder angle to facilitate the subsequent analysis and design the following variables are defined as d w i d w i m i χ c i χ c i m i i u r remark 1 with respect to the cable laying vessel the underactuated 3dof model is adopted as the research plant fig 1 presents the lateral view of cable laying vessel obviously it is easily seen that there are only two main propulsion devices the propeller and rudder different form the common marine underactuated vehicles the cable generated loads require to be considered and included in the dynamics model 2 of cable laying vessel note that the cable resulted damping effects are quite small and can even be ignored when compared to the main thrust force moments produced by the ship s propulsion equipment based on the above analysis the cable caused loads in the surge and yaw orientation can be considered as zero i e χ c i 0 i u r assumption 1 the redefined ocean disturbances variable d w i and cable generated loads χ c i i u r are bounded satisfying d w i d w i and χ c i χ c i where d w i χ c i are unknown positive constants just for the theory analysis assumption 2 on the basis of the rigorous theoretical analysis in li et al 2008 the sway velocity v of underactuated ship is passive bounded assumption 3 fu et al 2012 the cable laying vessel submarine laying equipment and cable catenary are in the same longitudinal profile and the sailing speed of working boat is consistent with that of cable laying operation remark 2 in the practical engineering ocean disturbances are continually changing with finite energy and always bounded that can illustrate the rationality of assumption 1 besides the sway velocity of underactuated ship will be attenuated gradually under the hydrodynamic and the cable generated damping effects thus the passive bounded stability result in assumption 2 is also reasonable and tenable in the marine practice considering that the cable laying operation is usually performed at a low speed the reasonability of assumption 3 can be satisfied and such a claim has been also mentioned in fu et al 2012 2

cable laying operation and the main objective is to develop a practical cable laying scheme for the underactuated workboat such that 1 the cable can be accurately laid onto the setpoints based reference path in the presence of unknown disturbances and communication constraints 2 all signals in the closed loop system are guaranteed to be semi global uniformly ultimately bounded 3 dvsl guidance in view of the fact that the practical marine cable laying operation is implemented via the laying sample points the dvsl guidance is thus developed using the lvs and the avs fig 2 shows the guidance principle of dvsl guidance algorithm in the proposed guidance the lvs is responsible for generating the desired laying path of cables the function of the avs is to provide the smooth reference path for cable laying vehicles note that both path generators are ideal agents without considering their inertial and damping effects layer 1 by exploring the path separation principle in zhang and zhang 2015 the setpoints based cable laying trajectory can be split into the straight path s t r s k and curve one c u r s k in this way we can use the lvs 8 to accomplish the piecewise programming task of these paths 8 η c r η c ν c where η c x c y c ψ c t is the position vector of the lvs ν c u c v c r c t is the corresponding velocity vector r η c is the rotation matrix with the definition as eq 9 9 r η c cos ψ c sin ψ c 0 sin ψ c cos ψ c 0 0 0 1 for the straight path the user defined surge speed u c is assigned to the virtual ship to generate the related reference path while for the curve segment the virtual ship can achieve the auto turning with the dynamic turning angular velocity r c u c r k k 1 2 n it is noted that the calculation of r c depends on the size of turning radius where the real ship maneuvering performance and the real time path switching angle δ ϕ k need to be taken into consideration based on the maneuvering practice we design the detailed selection principle of turning radius as eq 10 by implementing the above design to each setpoint the desired laying path of cables can be obtained 10 r i r max if δ ϕ k π 2 r max r min δ ϕ i sign δ ϕ i π 2 if δ

0 1 ν s u c l t c r c r c though it should be noted that the current reference path original reference path of cable laying vessel is not completely smooth due to the use of piecewise planning strategy that may lead to the abrupt jump of control forces moments liu 2019 for this purpose the avs is introduced to provide the improved reference signal for the cable laying vehicle eq 14 gives the kinematics expression of avs similar to that of lvs different from the lvs the avs is with the adaptive property that is its velocity can be automatically programmed based on the variation of tracking errors 14 η a r η a ν a where η a x a y a ψ a t and ν a u a v a r a t are the position vector and the velocity vector of avs respectively r η a is also a transformation matrix similar to 9 to achieve the desired convergence objective η a η s the velocity vector of avs can be programmed as 15 15 ν a r t η a k a e ν ˆ max tanh e ϱ e where e η s η a is the convergence error k a is the related control coefficient matrix ϱ e is a positive constant note that the reference velocity vector ν s satisfies the constraining condition as ν s ν max where ν max is a positive constant ν ˆ max is its estimation value and updated via the adaptive law 16 16 ν ˆ max γ a e t tanh e ϱ e k a v ˆ max v ˆ max 0 where γ a k a are positive design parameters theorem 1 for any initial conditions satisfying e 0 t e 0 γ a 1 ν max 2 0 ρ a with any ρ a 0 the avs 14 can converge to the reference path of cable laying ship under the proposed velocity controller 15 and the adaptive law 16 proof consider the

bounded stability can be proved by lim t v 1 ε 2 b that also means that all error signals in the closed loop system are bounded using the proposed velocity controller and the adaptive laws the designed avs can be guaranteed to converge to the desired path within small errors 4 formulation of the composite neural robust adaptive control algorithm with event triggered inputs with the framework of backstepping an improved composite neural adaptive control algorithm is developed by incorporating the event triggered mechanism where the unknown disturbances and the limited communication resource are fully investigated section 4 1 introduces the inputs dominated event triggered design section 4 2 presents the related controller derivation details 4 1 design of the inputs based event triggered mechanism motivated by the triggering idea in xing et al 2017 the inputs dominated event triggered mechanism is developed to reduce the communication burden in the controller to actuator channels in particular the triggering rule depends on the magnitude of control signals besides the measurable control variables the main engine revolution and the rudder angle are selected as the triggering operator due to the incorporation of the actuator servo system to facilitate the corresponding derivation one defines two immediate control variables in eq 27 27 n u n n n r δ the relative triggering protocol is defined as eq 28 28 n i t n w i t k i t t k i t k 1 i t k 1 i inf t t k i e i t κ i n i t σ i where n w i t i u r is the control law at the triggering instant e i t n w i t n i t denotes the triggering error κ is triggering coefficient satisfying 0 κ i 1 for the event triggered behavior the control command n i t will be updated and replaced with n w i t k 1 i once the triggering condition 26 is violated when the system is in the flow period i e t t k i t k 1 i the control signals will keep unchanged that also indicates that the trigger error inequality e i t κ i n i t σ i holds in the flow time based on the analysis in xing et al 2017 there exist two unknown constants θ 1 i t 1 1 θ 2 i t 1 1 to depict the error relationship as 29 29 n w i t n i t θ 1 i t κ i n i t θ 2 i t σ i correspondingly n i t can be rewritten as 30 30 n i t n w i t 1 θ 1 i t κ i θ 2 i t σ i 1 θ 1 i t κ i remark 3 compared to the result in xing et al 2017 the proposed event trigger mechanism takes the measurable actuator inputs as the triggering operator which is easy to be implemented in real world applications besides the triggering condition is characterized by the dynamic regulation that is the triggering threshold will vary with the real time size of control inputs that not only ensures the control performance but also reduces the unnecessary information transmission 4 2 controller design to facilitate the detailed introduction of proposed controller we firstly give the dvsl guidance based path following control framework in fig 3 the whole design procedure consists of two steps kinematics and kinetics errors stabilization step 1 at this step the main task is to stabilize the kinematics error between the real ship and the avs for this purpose one firstly constructs the kinematics error eq 31 according to fig 3 31 x e x a x y e y a y z e x e 2 y e 2 ψ e ψ r ψ where ψ r is the ship s azimuth angle relative to the avs eq 32 shows its calculation method in different situations 32 ψ r ψ r d if x e 0 π 2 if x e 0 and y e 0 π 2 if x e 0 and y e 0 ψ a if x e 0 and y e 0 where ψ r d 0 5 1 sgn x e sgn y e π arctan y e x e differentiating z e and ψ e produces 33 z e π α u u α u ψ e ψ r α r r α r where π 2 u sin 0 5 ψ e 2 v sin ψ e x a cos ψ r y a sin ψ r α u and α r are virtual control laws that will be designed later as for the conventional backstepping the virtual control signal requires to be repeatedly differentiated to obtain its analytical derivative which will lead to the explosion of complexity problem fortunately the command filter technique has been proposed to solve this problem yu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 the working principle is that let the virtual control signal pass into a second order filter eq 34 gives the differentiation equation of command filter β i and β i 2 are output signals satisfying β i 0 α i 0 and β i 2 0 0 χ i 0 is the natural frequency and ζ i 0 1 is the damping parameter when the system input α i satisfies the constraint condition the filter error β i α i can be adjusted to be small enough to guarantee the convergence performance of command filter 34 β i χ i β i 2 i u r β i 2 2 ζ i χ i β i 2 χ i β i α i to facilitate the subsequent derivation one defines the following kinetics error relationships 35 based on the backstepping recursive design 35 u e β u u r e β r r substituting 35 into 33 generates 36 36 z e π α u β u α u u e ψ e ψ r α r β r α r r e considering that filter errors may degrade the steady state control performance the related compensation terms s i 1 s i 2 i u r are designed in 37 to remove those useless filter errors 37 s u 1 k z u 1 s u 1 β u α u s u 2 k z u 2 s u 2 s r 1 k z u 1 s r 1 β r α r s r 2 k z r 2 s r 2 by fusion of the filter compensating terms the compensated tracking error is constructed and differentiated as 38 38 z u 1 z e s u 1 π α u k z u 1 s u 1 u e z r 1 ψ e s r 1 ψ r α r k z r 1 s r 1 r e to achieve the desired kinematics stabilization the virtual control law is chosen as 39 α u k z u 1 z e π s u 2 α r k z r 1 ψ e ψ r s r 2 step 2 at this step the goal is to accomplish the kinetics error stabilization in the presence of the actuator gain uncertainty model uncertainty and time varying external disturbances for this purpose the compensated kinetics error z i 2 i u r is firstly defined by eq 40 40 z i 2 β i f i ν s i 2 taking its time derivative along eqs 2 38 and 40 41 z i 2 β i f i ν g i m i n w i 1 θ i κ i ξ i k z ı 2 s i 2 with 42 ξ i d w i χ c i g i m i θ 2 i σ i 1 θ i κ i as mentioned in tong et al 2021 nns are with the universal approximating capability for the nonlinear continuous function in the proposed algorithm they are utilized to model the system uncertainty 43 on the basis of lemma 2 43 f i ν s

basis function s ν define b i a i f a i m a i b i w i a i m z ν 2 it is obvious that b i w i a i z ν 2 can be derived easily based on the above conclusion eq 41 can be rewritten as eq 44 44 z i 2 β i

noted that all components of g i m i θ 2 i σ i 1 θ 1 i κ i are also bounded variables constants thus the given equality g i m i θ 2 i σ i 1 θ 1 i κ i δ i can be satisfied by recalling the above boundedness analysis we can conclude 46 ξ i a i f β ν s ν 2 s ν f ɛ i d w i χ c i δ i ϖ i φ i ν where ϖ i max a i f ɛ i d w i χ c i δ i φ i ν is the related damping term with the form as φ i ν 1 β ν s ν 2 s ν f in the proposed mechanism the actuator servo system is also considered to acquire measurable control commands i e the main engine revolution n and the rudder angle δ note that a gain related adaptive parameter ω ˆ i is designed and updated to compensate for the actuator gain uncertainty which is the estimation value of ω i m i 1 θ 1 i κ i g i by combining the immediate control law with the adaptive law the actual control input can be derived the following construction 47 is useful for the further derivation 47 n w i α w i ω ˆ i α w i β i γ i φ i z i 2 k z i 2 i e z i 1 where φ i 1 4 s ν s t ν φ i 2 i u r γ i 0 k z i 2 0 therefore the main engine revolution and the rudder angle will be formulated as n sgn n w u n w u and δ n w r respectively in the existing literatures little attention is put on the approximation accuracy of nns considering this point the spem is introduced to improve the corresponding approximation effects for uncertain ship dynamics the spem based prediction errors are defined as 48 e p i i ˆ i i u r design the velocity prediction dynamics as 49 i ˆ k p i e p i γ i φ i e p i α w i where k p u k p r are positive design parameters which determines the estimation effects of state predictors by incorporating the compensated tracking error and the prediction one one derives the composite adaptive law as eq 50 50 ω ˆ i γ i α w i z i 2 e p i ξ i ω ˆ i ω ˆ i 0 where γ i ξ i are positive design constants 5 stability analysis and existence analysis of the minimum inter event time 5 1 stability analysis by assessing the error dynamics between the avs and the cable laying ship the stability analysis of closed loop system is carried out in this section and the main result is summarized as theorem 2 see fig 4 theorem 2 under

can obtain eq 58 58 v 2 ς 2 c v 2 0 ς 2 c exp 2 c t obviously v 2 is uniformly ultimately bounded satisfying lim t v 2 t ς 2 c that implies that all errors will converge to a small neighborhood of the origin under assumption 1 it is known from 31 and 38 that x y ψ are all bounded by combining the boundedness of s i 1 s i 2 i u r farrell et al 2009 accordingly the virtual control law α i is also bounded that can directly prove the boundedness of velocity variables u r based on 40 in addition the sway velocity v is passive bounded based on assumption 2 thus all signals in the closed loop system can be guaranteed to be sguub under the proposed algorithm according to eqs 51 and 58 we can obtain 59 z i 1 ς c 2 v 2 0 ς 2 c exp 2 c t therefore it is concluded that the compensated tracking errors will fall into and remain in a attractive compact set ω t z u 1 z r 1 ς c z r 1 ς c with t and the compact set can be decreased by increasing k z i 1 k z i 2 k p i ξ i γ i γ i i u r which is helpful for improving the tracking accuracy the proof is completed remark 4 although the large control gain can lead to a better tracking performance that will generate the unexpected control signals and may even destroy the system stability therefore there always exists a trade off between the control performance and the system stability in addition it is noted that the obtained closed loop stability is only semi global that is because the satisfactory approximation performance can be guaranteed only if the nns input vector remains in a suitable compact set actually how to obtain the global stability result is still an open problem in the existing researches that will be our research emphasis in the future 5 2 existence of the minimum inter event time in the proposed algorithm the event triggered control technique has been employed to release the network communication traffic in the controller to actuator channel though the zeno behavior may happen i e the defined event will be triggered infinitely in a finite time interval that made lead to the failure of designed event triggered mechanism in what follows we will show that there exists a positive constant t i satisfying k z t k 1 i t k i t i by recalling the definition of triggering measurement error we have 60 d d t e i d d t e i e i 1 2 sgn e i e i n w i through the lyapunov stability analysis it is proved that all signals in the closed loop system are sguub as a function of all bounded variables it can be inferred from 47 that n w i is differential and bounded so there must exist a positive constant ι i such that n w i ι i hold in addition it is easy to know that e i t k i 0 and lim t t k 1 i e i t σ i based on the above analysis it is concluded that the minimum inter event time must satisfy t i σ i ι i in this way the existence of minimum inter event time can be guaranteed and the zeno behavior can be thus effectively excluded 6 illustrative experiment to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm the illustrative experiments are carried out in the matlab platform including the comparative experiment and the cable laying experiment in the presence of the simulated ocean disturbances in the simulation test the long range patrol boat austal patrol 38 length overall l 38 2 m molded beam b 7 2 m is selected as the interesting plant which has been considered in do et al 2004 table 1 presents its detail model parameters 6 1 guidance comparison in this note an improved version of dll guidance i e dvsl guidance is proposed for the marine cable laying operation in order to stand out the superiority of the dvsl guidance we have organized the comparative experiment which consists of two parts part 1 is to highlight to the laying advantage of cables compared to the traditional los guidance part 2 is to introduce the sailing advantage of cable laying ships in comparison with the dll guidance part 1 to test the setpoint based cable laying performance of different guidance algorithms we have picked five sampling points to provide the cable laying reference s 1 0 m 0 m s 2 500 m 100 m s 3 600 m 700 m s 4 300 m 1200 m s 5 0 m 600 m note that the ideal virtual ship l 38 2 m is the actuating objective in this comparison where no inertial and damping effects are required to be considered the initial state of virtual ship is set as x c 0 y c 0 ψ c 0 0 m 0 m 0 rad and the guidance velocity is u c 5 m s for the proposed algorithm the turning radius is restricted in 2 l 5 l for the parameter details of los algorithm please refer to the reference literature fu et al 2012 in fig 4 a the laying trajectories of cables under three guidance laws are given although three approaches can accomplish the setpoints based cable laying task it should be noted that the dll and dvsl mechanisms own the larger cable laying coverage compared to the los algorithm especially in the sampling turning area that is exactly the advantage of the piecewise design strategy from fig 4 b it can be observed that the cable laying vessel requires the smaller turn under the dvsl guidance than the los algorithm and the reference path generated by the dvsl algorithm is with the smooth form by comparing with the dll mechanism for the quantity purpose we have performed the numerical calculation based on two interesting performance indexes i e the required length of cables rlc and the required voyage of cable laying ships rvs from the data comparison result in table 2 the proposed dvsl algorithm not only achieves the reasonable cable laying operation but also decreases the waste of valuable cables and cable laying ships resources part 2 as an improved version of dll guidance the dvsl algorithm can provide the smooth reference path for the cable laying ship actually such an improvement can effectively reduce the chattering phenomenon of control inputs when the ship is crossing the turning point to verify this view we have carried out the related experiment by comparing with the dll guidance in zhang et al 2020 following the previous method we just pick five sampling points to offer the laying reference i e s 1 0 m 200 m s 2 600 m 200 m s 3 900 m 800 m s 4 2300 m 800 m s 5 2000 m 1500 m in this experiment the proposed control approach is implemented by combining the dll and dvsl guidance respectively to clearly show the comparison result it is noted that the external disturbance is not considered in this test the initial position attitude and velocity state of ships are set as x 0 y 0 ψ 0 u 0 v 0 r 0 100 m 10 m 0 rad 0 m s 0 m s 0 rad s to obtain the satisfactory guidance and control performance the trial error strategy is adopted to select a set of appropriate design parameters as shown in eq 61 61 k z u 1 0 2 k z r 1 0 2 k z u 2 8 k z r 2 10

shown in figs 5 6 fig 5 depicts the laying trajectory of cables and the sailing trajectory of cable laying vessel under two guidance schemes although both guidance mechanisms can perform the cable laying task the resulted control inputs are with obvious differences in fig 6 the running curves of control signals are more smooth under the dvsl guidance algorithm especially at the turning points which can decrease the saturation risk and release the output pressure for marine actuators in conclusion the effectiveness and the superiority of dvsl guidance algorithm can be clearly demonstrated 6 2 control comparison in this experiment the control performance is the concerned research topic for this consideration the proposed algorithm is compared with the control approaches in zheng et al 2017 and zeng et al 2018 in the comparison the parameterized reference path is generated by the virtual ship with switched velocity for the straight path the surge velocity is set as u c 4 m s while for the curve one the turning angular velocity is given in 62 besides one employs the nonzero mean time varying disturbances as 63 to demonstrate the robustness of the controller 62 r c exp 0 005 t

i 5 i 1 2 l by adopting the trial error strategy we select a set of appropriate design parameters 64 to obtain the satisfactory control effects 65 iae q t 0 t q e d t q z ψ itae q t 0 t t q e d t q z ψ itce χ t 0 t t τ χ d t χ u r the final comparison results are shown in figs 7 9 fig 7 displays the ship s tracking trajectory under three controllers it can be easily observed from the enlarging details that the proposed controller owns the better tracking accuracy and response speed to further verify the control performance fig 8 gives the convergence curves of tracking errors clearly the proposed control algorithm is more competitive in the aspects of transient and steady state performance fig 9 displays the evolution curves of surge force τ u and yaw moment τ r form which it is easily seen that the control signals under the proposed control algorithm can fall quickly and remain into the steady range τ u n 1 1 0 5 3 1 0 5 τ r n m 1 1 0 8 3 1 0 8 based on the above analysis the superiority of proposed algorithm can be well illustrated to further reveal the control performance of three algorithms three popular indexes 65 are used for the quantified verification including the integrated absolute error iae the integrated time absolute error itae and the integrated time control energy itce itae and iae are used to describe the transient and steady state control performance respectively itce indicates the energy consumption ability of controllers the quantified comparison result is shown in table 3 obviously the smaller values for three indexes can be obtained under the proposed algorithm that implies that the proposed mechanism owns the better transient and steady performance without extra energy consumption to indicate the computation and communication performance of proposed algorithm some critical indexes i e computer s occupied memory and control triggered times are utilized to evaluate the computation and communication ability of controllers the detailed experiment data is listed on table 4 to minimize the randomness as much as possible we have ran 5 tests around memory usage on personal computers with different configurations from the mean held memory it can be seen that the proposed controller leads to the smaller memory usage compared to the results in zheng et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 which benefits from the robust neural damping technique in addition the effectiveness of proposed event triggered mechanism can be illustrated according to the triggering index compared with the time driven controllers in zheng et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 the updating frequency of actuators is significantly reduced under the proposed event triggered control law and the communication traffic in the controller to actuator channel is thus greatly released 6 3 simulated cable laying experiment in order to prove the practicability of proposed cable laying scheme fig 10 the setpoints based cable laying experiment is carried out in this subsection for this consideration the following five laying sample points are selected to supply the setpoints based laying reference i e s 1 0 m 200 m s 2 600 m 200 m s 3 900 m 800 m s 4 2300 m 800 m s 5 2000 m 1500 m in the experiment the marine environment is simulated by referring to the physical based mathematical model as shown in fig 11 the norsok wind and the pierson moscowitz pm wave spectrums are adopted to generate the corresponding disturbances that could improve the reliability of the proposed algorithm in the engineering practice the mean wind speed is set as 19 0 m s and the mean wind direction is set as ψ wind 30 deg for the parameters details of proposed guidance and control algorithms the reader can refer to the previous experiment part 2 in guidance comparison fig 12 describes the cable laying ship s navigation trajectory and resulted cable s laying result obviously the cable can be laid accurately on the setpoints based desired path even in the presence of ocean disturbances form fig 13 the control commands are characterized by the aperiodic computation and update that can verify the effectiveness of proposed event triggering mechanism fig 14 shows the evolution curves of adaptive parameters where the fast convergence can be achieved within 10 s that attributes to the incorporation of prediction error fig 15 presents the time interval between two adjacent triggering points form which it is calculated that the triggering times are only 832 compared to the time driven control mechanisms in zheng et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 a great quantify of communication resources will be saved under the proposed algorithm in general the effectiveness of proposed cable laying scheme can be preliminary illustrated via the above simulation experiment though the practical feasibility of theoretical algorithms under the real environment still needs further verification using a real ship or scaled mode 7 conclusion in this paper the path following issue of underactuated cable laying ship has been addressed from two aspects guidance and control by using the lvs and the avs the dvsl guidance is developed to provide the smooth reference paths for the cable and cable laying ship furthermore an improved composite neural robust control algorithm is proposed by combining the backstepping and the command filter technique we employed the rbf nns to approximate the model uncertainty and the approximation performance is enhanced via the modified spem the unknown actuator gain is compensated by two adaptive parameters and two practical control variables are derived by incorporating the event triggered strategy a great quantity of communication resources in the controller to actuator channel are thus saved a series of simulation experiments have verified the superiority and theoretical feasibility of proposed scheme in the practical engineering the actuators may suffer from the gradual or abrupt failures that will degrade the system

20264,scour depth prediction and its prevention is one of the most important issues in channel and waterway design however the potential for advanced machine learning ml algorithms to provide models of scour depth has yet to be explored this study provides the first quantification of the predictive power of a range of standalone and hybrid machine learning models using previously collected scour depth data from laboratory flume experiments the performance of five types of recently developed standalone machine learning techniques the isotonic regression isor sequential minimal optimization smo iterative classifier optimizer ico locally weighted learning lwl and least median of squares regression lms are assessed along with their hybrid versions with dagging da and random subspace rs algorithms the main findings are five fold first the da ico model had the highest prediction power second the hybrid models had a higher prediction power than standalone models third all algorithms underestimated the maximum scour depth except da ico which predicted scour depth almost perfectly fourth scour depth was most sensitive to densimetric particle froude number followed by the non dimensionalized contraction width flow depth within the contraction sediment geometric standard deviation approach flow velocity and median grain size fifth most of the algorithms performed best when all the input parameters were involved in the building of the model an important exception was the best performing model that required only four input parameters densimetric particle froude number non dimensionalized contraction width flow depth within the contraction and sediment geometric standard deviation overall the results revealed that hybrid machine learning algorithms provide more accurate predictions of scour depth than empirical equations and traditional ml algorithms in particular the da ico model not only created the most accurate predictions but also used the fewest easily and readily measured input parameters thus this type of model could be of real benefit to practicing engineers required to estimate maximum scour depth when designing in channel structures keywords scour depth prediction data mining iterative classifier optimizer algorithms model calibration 1 introduction channel contractions in rivers exist when there is a reduction in the width of the cross section the length of the contraction is defined based on the ratio between the length of the contacted area l and the width of the channel upstream of the contracted area b 1 approach width although the criterion for defining whether a contraction is long varies between researchers for example komura 1966 defined contractions as being long if the ratio was above unity webby 1984 if it was greater than two and raikar 2004 stated the contraction could only be considered long if the flow velocity and turbulence remained constant in the length of the contraction when l b 1 1 natural contractions in alluvial rivers such as debris accumulations longitudinal bars and confluences tend to be long contractions since the flow is nearly uniform in both the undisturbed channel and the contracted reach human made examples include gradual contractions created on both sides of the channel to accommodate dams bridges weirs and barrages and partial constrictions on one side of the channel such as spur dikes or cofferdams lim 1993 local scour at the contraction occurs because of a local increase in flow velocity and bed shear stress the severity of this scour varies according to upstream sediment supply conditions and thus the scour is categorized into two main groups clear water and live bed scour dey and raikar 2005 clear water scour takes place when sediment transport occurs from the scour hole throughout the contraction length and when there is no upstream sediment supply live bed scour takes place when there is upstream sediment supply dey 1997 to successfully design in channel structures the maximum scour depth which is mainly caused by constriction lim 1993 must be predicted because the depth dictates morphological change around the structure especially in long contractions and thus the structure s stability this prediction is commonly made under the assumption of an equilibrium condition lim and cheng 1998 the first analytical study of scour depth prediction in this condition in a long contraction was carried out by straub 1934 and subsequent studies have either proposed different empirical equations or modified straub s equation laursen 1960 ashida 1963 komura 1966 gill 1981 webby 1984 lim 1993 lim and cheng 1998 for example lim 1993 revealed that previously incorporated effective variables in clear water scour depth equations were inadequate and therefore proposed a new empirical formula for long contraction based on the approach flow velocity and depth median grain size of the bed material and the geometry of the constriction in a following study lim and cheng 1998 revealed straub s equation underestimates scour depth in both clear water and live bed conditions and proposed a new empirical formula based on only the approach water depth and the ratio between the approach and constricted channel width dey and raikar 2005 used an experimental approach to investigate the controlling variables on scour depth for uniform and graded sediments they found that lim s 1993 equation over predicted scour depth and developed their own empirical equation based on the limiting stability of bed sediments in the approaching channel under clear water scour these examples illustrate that a range of equations exist all based on differing controlling variables and each performing differently according to the channel and flow conditions being studied no universal equation exists to predict scour depth well in all conditions one possible reason is the proposed scour depth relationships were developed using conventional regression analysis recently machine learning ml algorithms have gained much interest because of their non linear structure maier et al 2014 superior prediction power particularly for complex phenomena shorter computational times low sensitivity to missing values and their ability to handle large datasets with different temporal and spatial scales melesse et al 2011 yaseen et al 2016 these ml based algorithms have been widely used in the fields of water science and hydraulic engineering artificial neural network ann algorithms are one of the most widely used abrahart et al 2012 ann was found initially to successfully predict scour depth around hydraulic structures muzzammil 2008 moussa 2013 onen 2014 but recent studies have shown low prediction capability if the training datasets are not carefully selected melesse et al 2011 kisi et al 2012 choubin et al 2018 especially when the range of testing data is out of range of the training dataset low generalization power adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis algorithms have been developed by integrating ann with fuzzy logic and used frequently to predict scour depth around hydraulic structures firat 2009 rady 2020 one of the key challenges in developing an accurate anfis models is determining accurately the weights in the membership function of the anfis algorithm bui et al 2016 alternative types of ml based algorithms have been successfully applied and proposed for scour depth prediction for example guven and gunal 2008 and azamathulla et al 2010 reported that genetic programming gp outperforms conventional regression and ann approaches ayoubloo et al 2010 showed the classification and regression trees cart algorithm is more accurate for scour modeling than the ann method furthermore etemad shahidi and ghaemi 2011 examined the potential of two other ml based algorithms support vector machine svm and m5 model tree it was found the m5 model tree algorithm outperformed ann and svm approaches ghaleh nou et al 2019 also found the same results for self adaptive extreme learning machine in comparison to svm and ann approaches one possible reason is that svm algorithms have many hyperparameters that require tuning and thus finding the best combination is a challenge issue whereas parsaie et al 2019 showed that svm provided more accurate predictions than ann and anfis approaches however najafzadeh et al 2016 reported the superiority of the anfis to svm revealing further that the performance of ml based algorithms are sensitive to the dataset and thus fluvial conditions used to build them najafzadeh et al 2013 2014 explored the influence of hybridization by applying neuro fuzzy group method of data handling gmdh systems based evolutionary algorithms to predict scour pile groups in clear water conditions it was revealed the integration of these models with evolutionary algorithms enhanced model performance in a subsequent study najafzadeh et al 2018 applied three algorithms of gene expression programming gep model tree mt and evolutionary polynomial regression epr to reveal that the mt algorithm had a higher prediction power than gep and epr in long channel contractions it was reported that the performance of gmdh gep was greater than the standalone ann gep and gmdh algorithms najafzadeh and saberi movahed 2019 the outperformnaces of ml based algorithms have been reported for predictions of scour depth in contrast to the empirical equations recently a new branch of machine learning have been developed providing strong performance in variety of environmental and engineering fields for example in the field of landslide prediction stochastic gradient descent sgd adaboost ab logistic model tree lmt functional tree ft naïve bayes tree nbt bayes network bn and naïve bayes nb algorithms have been successfully applied bui et al 2019a pham et al 2019 lmt rept and alternating decision trees adt algorithms have provided strong prediction of flood maps khosravi et al 2018a chapi et al 2017 and adt and ab algorithms have proved successful in the prediction of groundwater potential bui et al 2019b further khosravi et al 2018b and salih et al 2019 have applied ba m5p attribute selected classifier as m5rule m5r kstar instance based learning ibk random committee rept rc rept and random subspace rept rs rept to predict suspended

predicted using gaussian process gp algorithms bui et al 2020a and water quality indices have been simulated using a hybrid of ba cv parameter selection cvps and randomizable filtered classification rfc with decision trees algorithms bui et al 2020b all of these previous studies have shown that hybrid algorithms have a higher prediction power then their standalone counterparts but they have yet to be applied to the prediction of scour depth the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of hybrid machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions of maximum scour depth the focus was on scour within long contractions within clear water conditions five standalone machine learning algorithms isotonic regression isor sequential minimal optimization smo iterative classifier optimizer ico locally weighted learning lwl and least median of squares regression lms were hybridized with dagging da and random subspace rs algorithms to develop 10 novel hybrid algorithms da isor da smor da lwl da ico da lms isor rs smor rs lwl rs ico rs lms this study is the first to apply a diverse range of newly developed machine learning models to the prediction of scour depth the research offers new insight into which machine learning algorithms offer the potential to provide accurate and efficient predictions of scour depth based on readily and easily measured flow and channel variables 2 methodology 2 1 identifying effective parameters according to the literature the parameters which have a significant effect on scour depth in a long contraction can be classified into four different types straub 1934 laursen 1960 ashida 1963 komura 1966 gill 1981 webby 1984 lim 1993 lim and cheng 1998 raikar 2004 1 approaching flow conditions flow velocity u 1 critical flow velocity u c flow depth h 1 water density ρ w densimetric particle froude number fr 0 2 characteristics of the bed material median grain size d 50 sediment density ρ s sediment geometric standard deviation σ g 3 geometry of the un contracted section width b 1 h 1 and 4 geometry of the contracted width b 2 flow depth h 2 section the functional relationship of scour depth d s with these effective input parameters can be described as follows 1 d s f u 1 u c ρ w d 50 ρ s σ g b 1 h 1 b 2 g to enhance the modeling performance of the ml based algorithms azmathullah et al 2009 pal et al 2014 and allow direct comparisons between datasets and the results of previous studies all parameters were non dimensionalized such an approach is recommended in the application of ml algorithms because it improves model performance azmathullah et al 2009 pal et al 2014 since there are a large number of variables a non dimensional approach was also required in the use of the buckingham π theorem to determine groupings between parameters also more generally finding a functional relationship among non dimensional parameters can allow a practical model to be developed to mitigate the adverse consequences of the experimental data scale effects applying the buckingham π theorem and using δρ ρ s ρ w instead of ρ s and taking u 1 b 1 and ρ as repeating variables allows the following dimensionless parameters to be obtained 2 f d s b 1 u 1 u c d 50 b 1 b 2 b 1 h 1 b 1 δ ρ ρ u 1 2 g b 1 σ g 0 combining the three π parameters of u 1 2 g b 1 d 50 b 1 and δ ρ ρ as u 1 2 g b 1 d 50 b 1 1 δ ρ ρ 0 5 gives 3 f r 0 u 1 g ρ s ρ w 1 d 50 where f r 0 is the densimetric particle froude number using the buckingham theorem six dimensionless parameters were extracted as having the most effects on scour depth thus the scour depth was normalized using b 1 and the effective variables were extracted as follows 4 d s b 1 f u 1 u c f r 0 d 50 b 1 b 2 b 1 h 1 b 1 σ g eq 4 shows all effective variables given in eq 1 are appropriately incorporated as dimensionless model parameters in order to compute scour depth as a dependent variable d s b 1 is considered as a model output and dimensionless parameters given in the right hand side of eq 4 are used as model inputs the form of eq 4 is in agreement with that used for scour depth determination by dey and raikar 2005 and najafzadeh et al 2018 2 2 dataset collection and preparation in the current study 204 datasets from four laboratory flume studies collected and compiled by najafzadeh et al 2016 2018 for the testing of standalone learning algorithms were used komura 1966 gill 1981 webby 1984 lim 1993 dey and raikar 2005 all of the data were measured in a long contraction rectangular channel in a clear water condition the datasets were divided into three sections randomly among the 204 data 70 140 row data was used as a training dataset for model building 10 for calibration 22 row data and the remaining 20 42 row data for model validation a statistical summary of the datasets is presented in table 1 2 3 best input combination and sensitivity analysis apart from dataset quality the correct selection of the input parameters has the largest impact on model performance as explained in the application of the buckingham π theorem six different dimensionless parameters were obtained from the effective variables involved in order to understand the influence of individual dimensionless parameters on model performance different input combinations were evaluated this influence was determined by examining the correlation coefficient r between the input parameters and output d s b 1 table 2 for different input combinations table 3 the input combinations were constructed by first using the input parameter with the highest correlation coefficient fr 0 combination no 1 and then creating subsequent combinations by adding each time the parameter with the next highest r until the parameter with the lowest r was finally added combination no 6 this approach is the common way of determining the most effective input parameters yaseen et al 2016 khozani et al 2019 salih et al 2019 at first each developed algorithm was tested using all the input combinations and with default model parameter values to determine the best input combination once complete a sensitivity analysis examining the effect of each parameter on scour depth was performed using the testing dataset 2 4 models parameter optimization the determination of the optimum values for each model parameter has a great effect on the models predictive power optimal parameter values differ from study to study and there is not a global optimum value hence in any study identifying optimal model parameters is an important step in the model building process in the current study optimal values were determined using the widely accepted trial and error approach and the calibration dataset choubin et al 2018 sharafati et al 2019 the root mean square error rmse metric was used for determination of the optimum value as the lower the rmse for the testing phase shows the more effective the model performance optimum values for each ml algorithm along with some key definitions are presented in table a and b in the supplementary materials 2 5 model theory background 2 5 1 isotonic regression isor isotonic regression isor which is also called monotonic regression is an approach like any form of regression of fitting a line through the measured data but a number of rules and restrictions apply for example the fitting line isotonic curve must be non decreasing non increasing and has to be the closest distance from the measured data the key advantages of this algorithm are that it minimizes the mean square error in the training dataset and is not restricted in a functional linearity form such as a linear regression model as long as the function is monotonic increasing barlow et al 1972 fig 1 illustrates the difference between a linear regression and isotonic regression model more information about this algorithm are available in kruskal 1964 and de leeuw et al 2009 2 5 2 sequential minimal optimization regression smor sequential minimal optimization regression smor was first introduced by platt 1999 and later improved by smola and schölkopf 1998 and shevade et al 2000 for solving very large quadratic programming issues which can occur during the training of a svm algorithm these programming issues are divided into a smaller series of optimization quadratic programming sub issues based on osuna s theorem osuna and freund 1997 next an objective function is decreased at each step until a feasible point that satisfies all of the constraints is retained yang et al 2007 the smor computes the maximum error deviation med between measured and predicted values if predicted values are higher than med performance of the system components was fully satisfactory and if predicted values are lesser than med the model is often overlooked more information about this algorithm structure can be found in platt 1999 yang et al 2007 cheng and qu 2013 and yang 2014 2 5 3 locally weighted learning lwl locally weighted learning lwl is a class of function approximation techniques in which a prediction is made by using an approximated local model around a point of interest this approximation is achieved by using an instance based algorithm to assign instance weights which are then used by a specified weighted instances handler lwl can perform classification e g using naive bayes or regression e g using linear regression and is one of the most widely used lazy leaner algorithms lwl is a simple but appealing tool both instinctively and statistically for learning process dynamics of non linear problems due to its high flexibility the main drawback of this algorithm is the longer time required in the modeling process from model building to making predictions the algorithm is based on the following equation if y r z x r u r is considered as a non linear event the optimum output u d r can be calculated using the inverse approach of the event as follows arif et al 2001 5 u d r z 1 x d r y d r where z is considered as a non linear function x d r are the states and y d r is the optimum output more information about this algorithm can be found in atkeson et al 1997 2 5 4 iterative classifier optimizer ico the iterative classifier optimizer ico algorithm uses a cross validation or percentage split approach to optimize the number of iterations of the given iterative classifier the algorithm has the ability to handle missing nominal binary classes and attributes like numeric nominal binary and empty nominal saad 2018 a two iteration process is used models are run and the results compared with measured values and then feedback is submitted to the model to further learn and fine tune the results 2 5 5 least median of squares regression lms the least median of squares regression lms algorithm implements a least median squared linear regression using the existing weka linear regression class to form predictions these lms functions are generated from random subsamples of the data the lms with the lowest median squared error is chosen as the final model more information about this algorithm is presented in rousseeuw and leory 1987 and giloni and padberg 2002 2 5 6 disjoint aggregating dagging the disjoint aggregating da algorithm is a type of meta classifier that creates a number of disjoint stratified folds out of the data and feeds each chunk of data to a copy of the supplied base classifier predictions are made via averaging since all the generated base classifiers are put into the vote meta classifier the algorithm is useful for base classifiers that are quadratic or worse in time behavior in regard to the number of instances in the training data the strong capabilities of this algorithm include handling missing class values binary class nominal class nominal attributes empty nominal attributes and unary attributes more information about this algorithm can be found in ting and witten 1997a b 2 5 7 random subspace random subspace rs constructs a decision tree based classifier that maintains the highest accuracy on the training data and improves generalization accuracy as it grows in complexity ho 1998 this algorithm enhances the prediction power of the weak classifier algorithms the classifier in this algorithm consists of multiple trees constructed systematically by pseudo randomly selecting subsets of components of the feature vector that is trees constructed in randomly chosen subspaces more information about this algorithm can be found in ho 1998 2 6 model evaluation after the determination of the most effective input variable combinations and the optimum operator values each algorithm was trained by a training dataset and evaluated by a testing dataset since the models were built by a training dataset this evaluation can only show how well the constructed model fits the testing dataset and cannot be used for model validation chen et al 2019 for a visual analysis and assessment of the applied models scatter plots taylor diagrams and box plots were used one distinct advantage of the taylor diagram is that it benefits from the use of the two most common correlation statistics correlation and standard deviation sd taylor 2001 points are depicted on the diagram to compare the performance of different developed models the measured data point in the taylor diagram is considered as the reference point the closer the predicted value to this reference value in terms of r and sd shows the higher the prediction capability the advantage of a box plot is that it can show how well a model predicts extreme median and quartile values in addition rmse mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to quantify model performance these criteria were calculated as follows 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n d s m b 1 d s p b 1 d s p b 1 d s p b 1 i 2 7 m a e 1 n i 1 n d s m b 1 i d s p b 1 i 8 n s e 1 i 1 n d s m b 1 d s p b 1 d s p b 1 d s p b 1 i 2 i 1 n d s m b 1 d s m b 1 d s m b 1 i d s m b 1 2 where d s b 1 is the scour depth n is the number of datasets d s b 1 is the mean scour depth and m and p subscripts denote the measured and predicted values respectively the lower the rmse and mae illustrate the better the model performance model performance can be classified using the nse values between and 1 moriasi et al 2007 i unsatisfactory nse 0 4 ii acceptable 0 40 nse 0 50 iii satisfactory 0 50 nse 0

reliability 1 n i 1 n k i 100 the variable k i was estimated based on the relative average error rae if rae is 0 2 then k i 1 else k i 0 this threshold of 0 2 was determined based on the chinese standard value saberi movahed et al 2020 rae was calculated as follows 10 r a e d s m b 1 d s p b 1 d s m b 1 3 results and analysis 3 1 most least effective variables table 2 reveals the input parameters thst had the most effects on the local scour depth according to the correlation coefficients fr 0 had the most impact r 0 62 followed by b 2 b 1 r 0 58 h 1 b 1 r 0 56 σ g r 0 34 u 1 u c r 0 33 and d 50 b 1 r 0 29 3 2 best input combination as shown in table 4 most of the algorithms performed best when all the input parameters were involved in the building of the model input no 6 among six scenarios the input combinations of 3 4 and 5 gave the lowest rmse valuesa comparison in r values between combinations one and two input parameters shows that adding the b 2 b 1 parameter caused the prediction accuracy to significantly decrease for the majority of algorithms in contrast adding the h 1 b 1 parameter enhanced the prediction performance of all algorithms significantly comparison between input no 2 and 3 the effect of adding σ g was more mixed causing an increase in some cases and little change in others see the comparison between no 3 and no 4 adding u 1 u c and d 50 b 1 caused the model performance to improve in the majority of cases the models with just one or two input parameters failed to provide accurate predictions of scour depth this poor performance occurred because some parameters had a poor linear correlation with d s b 1 since the correlation was non linear however incorporating these parameters into the models that can handle non linear relationships enhanced the model accuracy significantly 3 3 models performance evaluation a visual comparison of the prediction power of the ml models is shown in fig 2 these plots reveal that all developed algorithms could predict scour depth reasonably well but all algorithms underestimated the maximum scour depth except da ico which predicted scour depth almost perfectly the lwl algorithm by contrast had the weakest performance among the standalone algorithms the ico model provided slightly better performance than others to further compare the performance of the standalone and hybridized ml models box plots are shown in fig 3 only the da ico model predicted maximum scour depth well but not perfectly and all other algorithms underestimated maximum values the smor and ico models estimated minimum scour depth very well the first quartile value was very well replicated by the da lwl model and ico da ico and rs ico models predicted the third quartile most accurately the rs ico model estimated the median scour depth almost perfectly the da ico model was closest to the observed reference point in the taylor plot fig 4 this plot showed that the da ico model had the highest performance because the predicted standard deviation of scour depth was closest to the standard deviation of the observed data and the correlation was also the highest the da lwl rs lwl and rs ico points almost overlapped on each other on the taylor plot indicating similar model performance a quantitative assessment of the predictive capability of the developed models is shown in fig 5 looking across all the evaluation metrics the da ico model provided the strongest performance with rmse mae and nse values of 0 010 m 0 008 m and 0 972 respectively the next strongest performing model was da lwl followed by rs lwl rs ico rs lms da lms ico da smor rs smor rs isor lms da isor isor smor and lwl according to the nse metric all the developed algorithms had a very good prediction power except the lwl model which had good performance the standalone lwl and smo models gave the lowest performance with higher rmse and mae and lower nse values among the standalone models ico produced the most accurate predictions all the metrics reveal that the hybridized version of the ml algorithm outperformed the standalone counterpart for example the standalone lwl model had a rmse value of 0 033 m while the da lwl and rs lwl models produced a rmse value of 0 014 m this hybridization represented a 58 improvement in standalone lwl performance in terms of rmse values hybridization with da and rs algorithms enhanced the performance of smor models by 23 ico by 41 da and 21 rs lms models by 10 da and 19 rs and isor by 9 ra the rmse values were the same for isor and da isor models a reliability analysis showed that the da ico hybrid model had the highest level of reliability 83 3 while the standalone model of lwl had the lowest degree of reliability 45 2 in all but one case da isor hybridization enhanced reliability table 5 4 discussion scouring takes place in clear water flow due to a contraction resulting from a change in channel cross section shape for a given discharge reducing the channel width causes an increase in flow velocity bed shear stress and thus scour in order to compute the scour depth in such a hydraulic condition several empirical equations have been proposed in the literature developed using conventional regression analysis these equations are based on the most important variables considered to affect scour depth such as channel width flow depth and velocity in the un contracted and contracted sections of the channel these empirical equations do not perform as accurately as ml algorithms najafzadeh et al 2018 however no study has examined the performance of hybrid ml algorithms in predicting scour depth to this end this study sought to provide the first comparison of the accuracy of these novel algorithms with standalone ml algorithms and empirical equations the determination of the best input variable combination is one of the most critical steps in producing an accurate ml model the best input combination can be determined according to the highest correlation coefficient in a multiple regression barzegar and asghari 2016 however the it was found that this approach for scour prediction is not the best to take because the best input combination was not the same for all algorithms and due to non linearity of the problem the variables with low correlation coefficients with scour depth enhanced the prediction power of the some of the models thus a range of different input variable combinations must be considered in the optimization of the ml models in order to find the best input combination a sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the importance of each dimensionless parameter in scour depth computation the results revealed that the upstream unconstructed densimetric particle froude number had the greatest impact on scour depth prediction in accordance to previous laboratory experiments this result is also consistent with dey and raikar 2005 who illustrated that the upstream densimetric particle froude number had the greatest effect on scour depth in which an increase in particle froude number decreased the scour depth this parameter represents the impact of the mobility of submerged sediment particles on scour depth dey and raikar 2005 and has been proposed as a suitable parameter for defining the initiation of sediment motion aguirre pe et al 2003 thus it is reasonable to expect the particle froude number to have this important impact on scour depth in our study we estimated the densimetric particle froude number based on the ratio between the approach flow velocity and submerged weight of the sediment the particle froude number can also be obtained when data is available through analyzing the hydrodynamic forces lift drag resistance and submerged weight acting on the sediment particle in equilibrium conditions safari et al 2017 the drag and lift forces have a positive effect on sediment motion and the buoyed weight of the sediment and resistance force have the opposite effect therefore to initiate scour the flow must have adequate force to overcome the buoyed weight and resistance force an alternative method to estimate the particle froude number is to combine the shields 1936 sediment threshold equation with the manning 1891 flow resistance formula in this formulation the particle froude number is an alternative type of shields 1936 threshold parameter expressed in terms of velocity rather than shear stress safari et al 2015 the da ico was found to provide the most accurate predictions of scour depth using four input parameters fr 0 b 2 b 1 h 1 b 1 and σ g for most of the other models six input parameters were required to provide the optimum prediction performance thus a further advantage of the da ico is in its relative simplicity using parameters that are more readily and easily measured removing the requirement to measure the approach and critical flow velocity the isor da isor and rs isor algorithms gave reasonable prediction accuracy with only fr 0 as an input demonstrating their efficiency the hybrid models had a higher prediction power than standalone models because hybrid models are more flexible than standalone models and have a non linear structure de ath and fabricius 2000 these two model properties are particularly important in the prediction of scour depth because of the non linearity between variables the lwl algorithm was the worst performing because in the lwl algorithm fitting the noise data causes a higher prediction error if noise in the dataset is not filtered out well and the algorithm does not have the ability to interpolate smoothly between datasets schneiderm and moore 1997 the difference in performance between algorithms is attributable to their different computational structures the da ico model provided the most accurate predictions for two reasons first the ico algorithm uses a cross validation or percentage split approach to optimize the number of iterations secondly the dagging algorithm benefits from ensemble learning in its structure multiple weak learners which outperforms a single strong learner dietterich 1997 this learning helps to reduce variance and avoid the over fitting problem caused by the use of a bootstrap procedure najafzadeh et al 2016 2018 using the same datasets as the current paper compared the performance of traditional ml based algorithms svm anfis gep epr and mt with the empirical equations of laursen 1963 komura 1966 gill 1981 and lim 1993 table 6 shows this comparison along with the current paper s rmse value for the best performing hybrid machine learning algorithm the table shows that the gep model rmse 0 026 m outperformed all empirical equations and the newly developed da ico model rmse 0 010 m performed significantly better than the gep model a 62 improvement in rmse when compared to the empirical equations in terms of rmse values the da ico model had 82 laursen 1963 93 lim 1993 95 komura 1966 and 99 gill 1981 better accuracy overall the results show that da ico models have great potential to produce robust predictions of scour depth in long contractions in clear water conditions as well as offering far superior prediction accuracy than existing empirical and traditional ml models a distinct strength of this model is the need for just four readily measured dimensionless variables densimetric particle froude number width of the un contracted section approach flow depth and sediment geometric standard deviation thus this type of data driven model could be of real practical benefit to engineers required to estimate maximum scour depth when designing bridges weirs spur dike and cofferdams future studies should consider the performance of these algorithms in the prediction of scour depth in more complex conditions such as within natural rivers than those featured in the studied datasets such as live bed scour non rectangular channels unsteady flows non equilibrium transport conditions and water worked beds that mimic better the surface topographies of natural coarse grained rivers cooper and tait 2009 5 conclusion the accurate prediction of scour depth is vital for preventing the collapse of in channel structures due to the non linear behavior of scour problem hybrid machine learning algorithms have great potential to produce accurate predictions of scour depth in long contractions using previously collected scour depth data from laboratory flume experiments this study tested this potential for the first time by comparing the prediction power of five standalone algorithms isotonic regression isor sequential minimal optimization smo iterative classifier optimizer ico locally weighted learning lwl and least median of squares regression lms and their hybrid versions with dagging da and random subspace rs algorithms i e da isor da smor da lwl da ico da lms rs isor rs smor rs lwl rs ico rs lms the main findings were as follows 1 a test of model performance showed that the da ico model had

which had good performance 2 the hybrid models had a higher prediction power than standalone models because the hybrid models are more flexible and have a non linear structure that better represents the non linear behavior of the scour problem 3 all algorithms underestimated the maximum scour depth except da ico which predicted scour depth almost perfectly 4 a sensitivity analysis revealed that scour depth was most sensitive to the densimetric particle froude number followed by the non dimensionalized contraction width flow depth within the contraction sediment geometric standard deviation approach flow velocity and median grain size 5 most of the algorithms performed best when all the input parameters were involved in the building of the model an important exception was the best performing model which required only four input parameters densimetric particle froude number and non dimensionalized contraction width flow depth within the contraction and sediment geometric standard deviation 6 variables with low correlation coefficients with scour depth enhanced the prediction power of the some of the models thus a range of different input variable combinations must be considered in the optimization of ml models overall the results revealed that the hybrid machine learning algorithms provide more accurate predictions of scour depth than empirical equations and traditional ml algorithms the da ico model not only created the most accurate predictions but also used the fewest easily and readily measured input parameters thus this type of model could be of real benefit to practicing engineers required to estimate maximum scour depth when designing in channel structures in this case understanding more about the potential for hybrid ml algorithms to provide

20264,scour depth prediction and its prevention is one of the most important issues in channel and waterway design however the potential for advanced machine learning ml algorithms to provide models of scour depth has yet to be explored this study provides the first quantification of the predictive power of a range of standalone and hybrid machine learning models using previously collected scour depth data from laboratory flume experiments the performance of five types of recently developed standalone machine learning techniques the isotonic regression isor sequential minimal optimization smo iterative classifier optimizer ico locally weighted learning lwl and least median of squares regression lms are assessed along with their hybrid versions with dagging da and random subspace rs algorithms the main findings are five fold first the da ico model had the highest prediction power second the hybrid models had a higher prediction power than standalone models third all algorithms underestimated the maximum scour depth except da ico which predicted scour depth almost perfectly fourth scour depth was most sensitive to densimetric particle froude number followed by the non dimensionalized contraction width flow depth within the contraction sediment geometric standard deviation approach flow velocity and median grain size fifth most of the algorithms performed best when all the input parameters were involved in the building of the model an important exception was the best performing model that required only four input parameters densimetric particle froude number non dimensionalized contraction width flow depth within the contraction and sediment geometric standard deviation overall the results revealed that hybrid machine learning algorithms provide more accurate predictions of scour depth than empirical equations and traditional ml algorithms in particular the da ico model not only created the most accurate predictions but also used the fewest easily and readily measured input parameters thus this type of model could be of real benefit to practicing engineers required to estimate maximum scour depth when designing in channel structures keywords scour depth prediction data mining iterative classifier optimizer algorithms model calibration 1 introduction channel contractions in rivers exist when there is a reduction in the width of the cross section the length of the contraction is defined based on the ratio between the length of the contacted area l and the width of the channel upstream of the contracted area b 1 approach width although the criterion for defining whether a contraction is long varies between researchers for example komura 1966 defined contractions as being long if the ratio was above unity webby 1984 if it was greater than two and raikar 2004 stated the contraction could only be considered long if the flow velocity and turbulence remained constant in the length of the contraction when l b 1 1 natural contractions in alluvial rivers such as debris accumulations longitudinal bars and confluences tend to be long contractions since the flow is nearly uniform in both the undisturbed channel and the contracted reach human made examples include gradual contractions created on both sides of the channel to accommodate dams bridges weirs and barrages and partial constrictions on one side of the channel such as spur dikes or cofferdams lim 1993 local scour at the contraction occurs because of a local increase in flow velocity and bed shear stress the severity of this scour varies according to upstream sediment supply conditions and thus the scour is categorized into two main groups clear water and live bed scour dey and raikar 2005 clear water scour takes place when sediment transport occurs from the scour hole throughout the contraction length and when there is no upstream sediment supply live bed scour takes place when there is upstream sediment supply dey 1997 to successfully design in channel structures the maximum scour depth which is mainly caused by constriction lim 1993 must be predicted because the depth dictates morphological change around the structure especially in long contractions and thus the structure s stability this prediction is commonly made under the assumption of an equilibrium condition lim and cheng 1998 the first analytical study of scour depth prediction in this condition in a long contraction was carried out by straub 1934 and subsequent studies have either proposed different empirical equations or modified straub s equation laursen 1960 ashida 1963 komura 1966 gill 1981 webby 1984 lim 1993 lim and cheng 1998 for example lim 1993 revealed that previously incorporated effective variables in clear water scour depth equations were inadequate and therefore proposed a new empirical formula for long contraction based on the approach flow velocity and depth median grain size of the bed material and the geometry of the constriction in a following study lim and cheng 1998 revealed straub s equation underestimates scour depth in both clear water and live bed conditions and proposed a new empirical formula based on only the approach water depth and the ratio between the approach and constricted channel width dey and raikar 2005 used an experimental approach to investigate the controlling variables on scour depth for uniform and graded sediments they found that lim s 1993 equation over predicted scour depth and developed their own empirical equation based on the limiting stability of bed sediments in the approaching channel under clear water scour these examples illustrate that a range of equations exist all based on differing controlling variables and each performing differently according to the channel and flow conditions being studied no universal equation exists to predict scour depth well in all conditions one possible reason is the proposed scour depth relationships were developed using conventional regression analysis recently machine learning ml algorithms have gained much interest because of their non linear structure maier et al 2014 superior prediction power particularly for complex phenomena shorter computational times low sensitivity to missing values and their ability to handle large datasets with different temporal and spatial scales melesse et al 2011 yaseen et al 2016 these ml based algorithms have been widely used in the fields of water science and hydraulic engineering artificial neural network ann algorithms are one of the most widely used abrahart et al 2012 ann was found initially to successfully predict scour depth around hydraulic structures muzzammil 2008 moussa 2013 onen 2014 but recent studies have shown low prediction capability if the training datasets are not carefully selected melesse et al 2011 kisi et al 2012 choubin et al 2018 especially when the range of testing data is out of range of the training dataset low generalization power adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis algorithms have been developed by integrating ann with fuzzy logic and used frequently to predict scour depth around hydraulic structures firat 2009 rady 2020 one of the key challenges in developing an accurate anfis models is determining accurately the weights in the membership function of the anfis algorithm bui et al 2016 alternative types of ml based algorithms have been successfully applied and proposed for scour depth prediction for example guven and gunal 2008 and azamathulla et al 2010 reported that genetic programming gp outperforms conventional regression and ann approaches ayoubloo et al 2010 showed the classification and regression trees cart algorithm is more accurate for scour modeling than the ann method furthermore etemad shahidi and ghaemi 2011 examined the potential of two other ml based algorithms support vector machine svm and m5 model tree it was found the m5 model tree algorithm outperformed ann and svm approaches ghaleh nou et al 2019 also found the same results for self adaptive extreme learning machine in comparison to svm and ann approaches one possible reason is that svm algorithms have many hyperparameters that require tuning and thus finding the best combination is a challenge issue whereas parsaie et al 2019 showed that svm provided more accurate predictions than ann and anfis approaches however najafzadeh et al 2016 reported the superiority of the anfis to svm revealing further that the performance of ml based algorithms are sensitive to the dataset and thus fluvial conditions used to build them najafzadeh et al 2013 2014 explored the influence of hybridization by applying neuro fuzzy group method of data handling gmdh systems based evolutionary algorithms to predict scour pile groups in clear water conditions it was revealed the integration of these models with evolutionary algorithms enhanced model performance in a subsequent study najafzadeh et al 2018 applied three algorithms of gene expression programming gep model tree mt and evolutionary polynomial regression epr to reveal that the mt algorithm had a higher prediction power than gep and epr in long channel contractions it was reported that the performance of gmdh gep was greater than the standalone ann gep and gmdh algorithms najafzadeh and saberi movahed 2019 the outperformnaces of ml based algorithms have been reported for predictions of scour depth in contrast to the empirical equations recently a new branch of machine learning have been developed providing strong performance in variety of environmental and engineering fields for example in the field of landslide prediction stochastic gradient descent sgd adaboost ab logistic model tree lmt functional tree ft naïve bayes tree nbt bayes network bn and naïve bayes nb algorithms have been successfully applied bui et al 2019a pham et al 2019 lmt rept and alternating decision trees adt algorithms have provided strong prediction

rfc with decision trees algorithms bui et al 2020b all of these previous studies have shown that hybrid algorithms have a higher prediction power then their standalone counterparts but they have yet to be applied to the prediction of scour depth the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of hybrid machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions of maximum scour depth the focus was on scour within long contractions within clear water conditions five standalone machine learning algorithms isotonic regression isor sequential minimal optimization smo iterative classifier optimizer ico locally weighted learning lwl and least median of squares regression lms were hybridized with dagging da and random subspace rs algorithms to develop 10 novel hybrid algorithms da isor da smor da lwl da ico da lms isor rs smor rs lwl rs ico rs lms this study is the first to apply a diverse range of newly developed machine learning models to the prediction of scour depth the research offers new insight into which machine learning algorithms offer the potential to provide accurate and efficient predictions of scour depth based on readily and easily measured flow and channel variables 2 methodology 2 1 identifying effective parameters according to the literature the parameters which have a significant effect on scour depth in a long contraction can be classified into four different types straub 1934 laursen 1960 ashida 1963 komura 1966 gill 1981 webby 1984 lim 1993 lim and cheng 1998 raikar 2004 1 approaching flow conditions flow velocity u 1 critical flow velocity u c flow depth h 1 water density ρ w densimetric particle froude number fr 0 2 characteristics of the bed material median grain size d 50 sediment density ρ s sediment geometric standard deviation σ g 3 geometry of the un contracted section width b 1 h 1 and 4 geometry of the contracted width b 2 flow depth h 2 section the functional relationship of scour depth d s with these effective input parameters can be described as follows 1 d s f u 1 u c ρ w d 50 ρ s σ g b 1 h 1 b 2 g to enhance the modeling performance of the ml based algorithms azmathullah et al 2009 pal et al 2014 and allow direct comparisons between datasets and the results of previous studies all parameters were non dimensionalized such an approach is recommended in the application of ml algorithms because it improves model performance azmathullah et al 2009 pal et al 2014 since there are a large number of variables a non dimensional approach was also required in the use of the buckingham π theorem to determine groupings between parameters also more generally finding a functional relationship among non dimensional parameters can allow a practical model to be developed to mitigate the adverse consequences of the experimental data scale effects applying the buckingham π theorem and using δρ ρ s ρ w instead of ρ s and taking u 1 b 1 and ρ as repeating variables allows the following dimensionless parameters to be obtained 2 f d s b 1 u 1 u c d 50 b 1 b 2 b 1 h 1 b 1 δ ρ ρ u 1 2 g b 1 σ g 0 combining the three π parameters of u 1 2 g b 1 d 50 b 1 and δ ρ ρ as u 1 2 g b 1 d 50 b 1 1 δ ρ ρ 0 5 gives 3 f r 0 u 1 g ρ s ρ w 1 d 50 where f r 0 is the densimetric particle froude number using the buckingham theorem six dimensionless parameters were extracted as having the most effects on scour depth thus the scour depth was normalized using b 1 and the effective variables were extracted as follows 4 d s b 1 f u 1 u c f r 0 d 50 b 1 b 2 b 1 h 1 b 1 σ g eq 4 shows all effective variables given in eq 1 are appropriately incorporated as dimensionless model parameters in order to compute scour depth as a dependent variable d s b 1 is considered as a model output and dimensionless parameters given in the right hand side of eq 4 are used as model inputs the form of eq 4 is in agreement with that used for scour depth determination by dey and raikar 2005 and najafzadeh et al 2018 2 2 dataset collection and preparation in the current study 204 datasets from four laboratory flume studies collected and compiled by najafzadeh et al 2016 2018 for the testing of standalone learning algorithms were used komura 1966 gill 1981 webby 1984 lim 1993 dey and raikar 2005 all of the data were measured in a long contraction rectangular channel in a clear water condition the datasets were divided into three sections randomly among the 204 data 70 140 row data was used as a training dataset for model building 10 for calibration 22 row data and the remaining 20 42 row data for model validation a statistical summary of the datasets is presented in table 1 2 3 best input combination and sensitivity analysis apart from dataset quality the correct selection of the input parameters has the largest impact on model performance as explained in the application of the buckingham π theorem six different dimensionless parameters were obtained from the effective variables involved in order to understand the influence of individual dimensionless parameters on model performance different input combinations were evaluated this influence was determined by examining the correlation coefficient r between the input parameters and output d s b 1 table 2 for different input combinations table 3 the input combinations were constructed by first using the input parameter with the highest correlation coefficient fr 0 combination no 1 and then creating subsequent combinations by adding each time the parameter with the next highest r until the parameter with the lowest r was finally added combination no 6 this approach is the common way of determining the most effective input parameters yaseen et al 2016 khozani et al 2019 salih et al 2019 at first each developed algorithm was tested using all the input combinations and with default model parameter values to determine the best input combination once complete a sensitivity analysis examining the effect of each parameter on scour depth was performed using the testing dataset 2 4 models parameter optimization the determination of the optimum values for each model parameter has a great effect on the models predictive power optimal parameter values differ from study to study and there is not a global optimum value hence in any study identifying optimal model parameters is an important step in the model building process in the current study optimal values were determined using the widely accepted trial and error approach and the calibration dataset choubin et al 2018 sharafati et al 2019 the root mean square error rmse metric was used for determination of the optimum value as the lower the rmse for the testing phase shows the more effective the model performance optimum values for each ml algorithm along with some key definitions are presented in table a and b in the supplementary materials 2 5 model theory background 2 5 1 isotonic regression isor isotonic regression isor which is also called monotonic regression is an approach like any form of regression of fitting a line through the measured data but a number of rules and restrictions apply for example the fitting line isotonic curve must be non decreasing non increasing and has to be the closest distance from the measured data the key advantages of this algorithm are that it minimizes the mean square error in the training dataset and is not restricted in a functional linearity form such as a linear regression model as long as the function is monotonic increasing barlow et al 1972 fig 1 illustrates the difference between a linear regression and isotonic regression model more information about this algorithm are available in kruskal 1964 and de leeuw et al 2009 2 5 2 sequential minimal optimization regression smor sequential minimal optimization regression smor was first introduced by platt 1999 and later improved by smola and schölkopf 1998 and shevade et al 2000 for solving very large quadratic programming issues which can occur during the training of a svm algorithm these programming issues are divided into a smaller series of optimization quadratic programming sub issues based on osuna s theorem osuna and freund 1997 next an objective function is decreased at each step until a feasible point that satisfies all of the constraints is retained yang et al 2007 the smor computes the maximum error deviation med between measured and predicted values if predicted values are higher than med performance of the system components was fully satisfactory and if predicted values are lesser than med the model is often overlooked more information about this algorithm structure can be found in platt 1999 yang et al 2007 cheng and qu 2013 and yang 2014 2 5 3 locally weighted learning lwl locally weighted learning lwl is a class of function approximation techniques in which a prediction is made by using an approximated local model around a point of interest this approximation is achieved by using an instance based algorithm to assign instance weights which are then used by a specified weighted instances handler lwl can perform classification e g using naive bayes or regression e g using linear regression and is one of the most widely used lazy leaner algorithms lwl is a simple but appealing tool both instinctively and statistically for learning process dynamics of non linear problems due to its high flexibility the main drawback of this algorithm is the longer time required in the modeling process from model building to making predictions the algorithm is based on the following equation if y r z x r u r is considered as a non linear event the optimum output u d r can be calculated using the inverse approach of the event as follows arif et al 2001 5 u d r z 1 x d r y d r where z is considered as a non linear function x d r are the states and y d r is the optimum output more information about this algorithm can be found in atkeson et al 1997 2 5 4 iterative classifier optimizer ico the iterative classifier optimizer ico algorithm uses a cross validation or percentage split approach to optimize the number of iterations of the given iterative classifier the algorithm has the ability to handle missing nominal binary classes and attributes like numeric nominal binary and empty nominal saad 2018 a two iteration process is used models are run and the results compared with measured values and then feedback is submitted to the model to further learn and fine tune the results 2 5 5 least median of squares regression lms the least median of squares regression lms algorithm implements a least median squared linear regression using the existing weka linear regression class to form predictions these lms functions are generated from random subsamples of the data the lms with the lowest median squared error is chosen as the final model more information about this algorithm is presented in rousseeuw and leory 1987 and giloni and padberg 2002 2 5 6 disjoint aggregating dagging the disjoint aggregating da algorithm is a type of meta classifier that creates a number of disjoint stratified folds out of the data and feeds each chunk of data to a copy of the supplied base classifier predictions are made via averaging since all the generated base classifiers are put into the vote meta classifier the algorithm is useful for base classifiers that are quadratic or worse in time behavior in regard to the number of instances in the training data the strong capabilities of this algorithm include handling missing class values binary class nominal class nominal attributes empty nominal attributes and unary attributes more information about this algorithm can be found in ting and witten 1997a b 2 5 7 random subspace random subspace rs constructs a decision tree based classifier that maintains the highest accuracy on the training data and improves generalization accuracy as it grows in complexity ho 1998 this algorithm enhances the prediction power of the weak classifier algorithms the classifier in this algorithm consists of multiple trees constructed systematically by pseudo randomly selecting subsets of components of the feature vector that is trees constructed in randomly chosen subspaces more information about this algorithm can be found in ho 1998 2 6 model evaluation after the determination of the most effective input variable combinations and the optimum operator values each algorithm was trained by a training dataset and evaluated by a testing dataset since the models were built by a training dataset this evaluation can only show how well the constructed model fits the testing dataset and cannot be used for model validation chen et al 2019 for a visual analysis and assessment of the applied models scatter plots taylor diagrams and box plots were used one distinct advantage of the taylor diagram is that it benefits from the use of the two most common correlation statistics correlation and standard deviation sd taylor 2001 points are depicted on the diagram to compare the performance of different developed models the measured data point in the taylor diagram is considered as the reference point the closer the predicted value to this reference value in terms of r and sd shows the higher the prediction capability the advantage of a box plot is that it can show how well a model predicts extreme median and quartile values in addition rmse mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to quantify model performance these criteria were calculated as follows 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n d s m b 1 d s p b 1 d s p b 1 d s p b 1 i 2 7 m a e 1 n i 1 n d s m b 1 i d s p b 1 i 8 n s e 1 i 1 n d s m b 1 d s p b 1 d s p b 1 d s p b 1 i 2 i 1 n d s m b 1 d s m b 1 d s m b 1 i d s m b 1 2 where d s b 1 is the scour depth n is the number of datasets d s b 1 is the mean scour depth and m and p subscripts denote the measured and predicted values respectively the lower the rmse and mae illustrate the

33 and d 50 b 1 r 0 29 3 2 best input combination as shown in table 4 most of the algorithms performed best when all the input parameters were involved in the building of the model input no 6 among six scenarios the input combinations of 3 4 and 5 gave the lowest rmse valuesa comparison in r values between combinations one and two input parameters shows that adding the b 2 b 1 parameter caused the prediction accuracy to significantly decrease for the majority of algorithms in contrast adding the h 1 b 1 parameter enhanced the prediction performance of all algorithms significantly comparison between input no 2 and 3 the effect of adding σ g was more mixed causing an increase in some cases and little change in others see the comparison between no 3 and no 4 adding u 1 u c and d 50 b 1 caused the model performance to improve in the majority of cases the models with just one or two input parameters failed to provide accurate predictions of scour depth this poor performance occurred because some parameters had a poor linear correlation with d s b 1 since the correlation was non linear however incorporating these parameters into the models that can handle non linear relationships enhanced the model accuracy significantly 3 3 models performance evaluation a visual comparison of the prediction power of the ml models is shown in fig 2 these plots reveal that all developed algorithms could predict scour depth reasonably well but all algorithms underestimated the maximum scour depth except da ico which predicted scour depth almost perfectly the lwl algorithm by contrast had the weakest performance among the standalone algorithms the ico model provided slightly better performance than others to further compare the performance of the standalone and hybridized ml models box plots are shown in fig 3 only the da ico model predicted maximum scour depth well but not perfectly and all other algorithms underestimated maximum values the smor and ico models estimated minimum scour depth very well the first quartile value was very well replicated by the da lwl model and ico da ico and rs ico models predicted the third quartile most accurately the rs ico model estimated the median scour depth almost perfectly the da ico model was closest to the observed reference point in the taylor plot fig 4 this plot showed that the da ico model had the highest performance because the predicted standard deviation of scour depth was closest to the standard deviation of the observed data and the correlation was also the highest the da lwl rs lwl and rs ico points almost overlapped on each other on the taylor plot indicating similar model performance a quantitative assessment of the predictive capability of the developed models is shown in fig 5 looking across all the evaluation metrics the da ico model provided the strongest performance with rmse mae and nse values of 0 010 m 0 008 m and 0 972 respectively the next strongest performing model was da lwl followed by rs lwl rs ico rs lms da lms ico da smor rs smor rs isor lms da isor isor smor and lwl according to the nse metric all the developed algorithms had a very good prediction power except the lwl model which had good performance the standalone lwl and smo models gave the lowest performance with higher rmse and mae and lower nse values among the standalone models ico produced the most accurate predictions all the metrics reveal that the hybridized version of the ml algorithm outperformed the standalone counterpart for example the standalone lwl model had a rmse value of 0 033 m while the da lwl and rs lwl models produced a rmse value of 0 014 m this hybridization represented a 58 improvement in standalone lwl performance in terms of rmse values hybridization with da and rs algorithms enhanced the performance of smor models by 23 ico by 41 da and 21 rs lms models by 10 da and 19 rs and isor by 9 ra the rmse values were the same for isor and da isor models a reliability analysis showed that the da ico hybrid model had the highest level of reliability 83 3 while the standalone model of lwl had the lowest degree of reliability 45 2 in all but one case da isor hybridization enhanced reliability table 5 4 discussion scouring takes place in clear water flow due to a contraction resulting from a change in channel cross section shape for a given discharge reducing the channel width causes an increase in flow velocity bed shear stress and thus scour in order to compute the scour depth in such a hydraulic condition several empirical equations have been proposed in the literature developed using conventional regression analysis these equations are based on the most important variables considered to affect scour depth such as channel width flow depth and velocity in the un contracted and contracted sections of the channel these empirical equations do not perform as accurately as ml algorithms najafzadeh et al 2018 however no study has examined the performance of hybrid ml algorithms in predicting scour depth to this end this study sought to provide the first comparison of the accuracy of these novel algorithms with standalone ml algorithms and empirical equations the determination of the best input variable combination is one of the most critical steps in producing an accurate ml model the best input combination can be determined according to the highest correlation coefficient in a multiple regression barzegar and asghari 2016 however the it was found that this approach for scour prediction is not the best to take because the best input combination was not the same for all algorithms and due to non linearity of the problem the variables with low correlation coefficients with scour depth enhanced the prediction power of the some of the models thus a range of different input variable combinations must be considered in the optimization of the ml models in order to find the best input combination a sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the importance of each dimensionless parameter in scour depth computation the results revealed that the upstream unconstructed densimetric particle froude number had the greatest impact on scour depth prediction in accordance to previous laboratory experiments this result is also consistent with dey and raikar 2005 who illustrated that the upstream densimetric particle froude number had the greatest effect on scour depth in which an increase in particle froude number decreased the scour depth this parameter represents the impact of the mobility of submerged sediment particles on scour depth dey and raikar 2005 and has been proposed as a suitable parameter for defining the initiation of sediment motion aguirre pe et al 2003 thus it is reasonable to expect the particle froude number to have this important impact on scour depth in our study we estimated the densimetric particle froude number based on the ratio between the approach flow velocity and submerged weight of the sediment the particle froude number can also be obtained when data is available through analyzing the hydrodynamic forces lift drag resistance and submerged weight acting on the sediment particle in equilibrium conditions safari et al 2017 the drag and lift forces have a positive effect on sediment motion and the buoyed weight of the sediment and resistance force have the opposite effect therefore to initiate scour the flow must have adequate force to overcome the buoyed weight and resistance force an alternative method to estimate the particle froude number is to combine the shields 1936 sediment threshold equation with the manning 1891 flow resistance formula in this formulation the particle froude number is an alternative type of shields 1936 threshold parameter expressed in terms of velocity rather than shear stress safari et al 2015 the da ico was found to provide the most accurate predictions of scour depth using four input parameters fr 0 b 2 b 1 h 1 b 1 and σ g for most of the other models six input parameters were required to provide the optimum prediction performance thus a further advantage of the da ico is in its relative simplicity using parameters that are more readily and easily measured removing the requirement to measure the approach and critical flow velocity the isor da isor and rs isor algorithms gave reasonable prediction accuracy with only fr 0 as an input demonstrating their efficiency the hybrid models had a higher prediction power than standalone models because hybrid models are more flexible than standalone models and have a non linear structure de ath and fabricius 2000 these two model properties are particularly important in the prediction of scour depth because of the non linearity between variables the lwl algorithm was the worst performing because in the lwl algorithm fitting the noise data causes a higher prediction error if noise in the dataset is not filtered out well and the algorithm does not have the ability to interpolate smoothly between datasets schneiderm and moore 1997 the difference in performance between algorithms is attributable to their different computational structures the da ico model provided the most accurate predictions for two reasons first the ico algorithm uses a cross validation or percentage split approach to optimize the number of iterations secondly the dagging algorithm benefits from ensemble learning in its structure multiple weak learners which outperforms a single strong learner dietterich 1997 this learning helps to reduce variance and avoid the over fitting problem caused by the use of a bootstrap procedure najafzadeh et al 2016 2018 using the same datasets as the current paper compared the performance of traditional ml based algorithms svm anfis gep epr and mt with the empirical equations of laursen 1963 komura 1966 gill 1981 and lim 1993 table 6 shows this comparison along with the current paper s rmse value for the best performing hybrid machine learning algorithm the table shows that the gep model rmse 0 026 m outperformed all empirical equations and the newly developed da ico model rmse 0 010 m performed significantly better than the gep model a 62 improvement in rmse when compared to the empirical equations in terms of rmse values the da ico model had 82 laursen 1963 93 lim 1993 95 komura 1966 and 99 gill 1981 better accuracy overall the results show that da ico models have great potential to produce robust predictions of scour depth in long contractions in clear water conditions as well as offering far superior prediction accuracy than existing empirical and traditional ml models a distinct strength of this model is the need for just four readily measured dimensionless variables densimetric particle froude number width of the un contracted section approach flow depth and sediment geometric standard deviation thus this type of data driven model could be of real practical benefit to engineers required to estimate maximum scour depth when designing bridges weirs spur dike and cofferdams future studies should consider the performance of these algorithms in the prediction of scour depth in more complex conditions such as within natural rivers than those featured in the studied datasets such as live bed scour non rectangular channels unsteady flows non equilibrium transport conditions and water worked beds that mimic better the surface topographies of natural coarse grained rivers cooper and tait 2009 5 conclusion the accurate prediction of scour depth is vital for preventing the collapse of in channel structures due to the non linear behavior of scour problem hybrid machine learning algorithms have great potential to produce accurate predictions of scour depth in long contractions using previously collected scour depth data from laboratory flume experiments this study tested this potential for the first time by comparing the prediction power of five standalone algorithms isotonic regression isor sequential minimal optimization smo iterative classifier optimizer ico locally weighted learning lwl and least median of squares regression lms and their hybrid versions with dagging da and random subspace rs algorithms i e da isor da smor da lwl da ico da lms rs isor rs smor rs lwl rs ico rs lms the main findings were as follows 1 a test of model performance showed that the da ico model had the highest prediction power followed by da lwl rs lwl rs ico rs lms da lms ico da smor rs smor rs isor lms da isor isor smor and lwl all models displayed very good performance except the lwl model which had good performance 2 the hybrid models had a higher prediction power than standalone models because the hybrid models are more flexible and have a non linear structure that better represents the non linear behavior of the scour problem 3 all algorithms underestimated the maximum scour depth except da ico which predicted scour depth almost perfectly 4 a sensitivity analysis revealed that scour depth was most sensitive to the densimetric particle froude number followed by the non dimensionalized contraction width flow depth within the contraction sediment geometric standard deviation approach flow velocity and median grain size 5 most of the algorithms performed best when all the input parameters were involved in the building of the model an important exception was the best performing model which required only four input parameters densimetric particle froude number and non dimensionalized contraction width flow depth within the contraction and sediment geometric standard deviation 6 variables with low correlation coefficients with scour depth enhanced the prediction power of the some of the models thus a range of different input variable combinations must be considered in the optimization of ml models overall the results revealed that the hybrid machine learning algorithms provide more accurate predictions of scour depth than empirical equations and traditional ml algorithms the da ico model not only created the most accurate predictions but also used the fewest easily and readily measured input parameters thus this type of model could be of real benefit to practicing engineers required to estimate maximum scour depth when designing in channel structures in this case understanding more about the potential for hybrid ml algorithms to provide relatively cheap and fast predictions of scour depth in more complex hydro sedimentary conditions represents a vital research avenue credit authorship contribution statement khabat khosravi
