18125,dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra an important intermediate process in the n cycle links n compound oxidation and reduction processes hence the oxic anoxic interface would be the hotspot of the dnra process in freshwater ecosystems the riparian zone is the most typical carrier of the oxic anoxic interface here we report spatio temporal evidence of a higher abundance and rate of dnra in the riparian zone than in the open water sediments based on molecular and 15n isotopic tracing technologies hence signifying a hotspot for the dnra process these abudance and rates were significantly higher than those in open water sediments 15n isotopic paring technology revealed that the dnra hotspot promoted higher rates of n compound oxidation no2 reduction no3 and dnra and n2 production anammox and denitrification in the riparian zone than those in open water sediment however high through sequencing analysis showed that the dnra bacteria in the riparian zone and openwater sediments were insignificantly different network and correlation analysis showed that the dnra abundance and rates were significantly positively correlated with tom tc nh4 and tc no2 but not with the dominant genera anaeromyxobacter lacunisphaera and sorangium which played different roles on the connection in the respective community networks the dnra process in the riparian zone could be driven mainly by the related environmental biogeochemical characteristics induced by anthropogenic changes followed by microbial processes this result provides valuable information for the management of riparian zones because anthropogenic changes in the riparian water table are expected to increase inducing consequent changes in the reduction from no3 to nh4 graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra hotspot riparian zone c n ratio nutrients circulation 1 introduction nitrogen n cycling is driven by microorganisms specifically nitrifying microorganisms oxidize excess ammonium via nitrite to nitrate and denitrifying microorganisms return the oxidized nitrogen species back to n2 thereby closing the cycle jetten 2008 nitrate which is a fixed form of nitrogen is a key node in the assimilatory and respiratory nitrogen pathways and plays an essential role as a nitrogen source electron acceptor and even resulting to undesirable by products i e greenhouse gas n2o and toxic substance no2 peng and zhu 2006 jetten 2008 kraft et al 2014 nitrate is mainly reduced to nitrogen gas n2 via denitrification process but also to ammonium via the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process dnra competes with denitrification for no3 with end products of nh4 since the dominance of these two pathways is determined by the environment kraft et al 2014 lu et al 2015 the roles drivers and underlying mechanisms of dnra are significantly different among ecosystems sanford et al 2012 roberts et al 2014 chen et al 2015 in oligotrophic marine and soil systems dnra produces nh4 to improve primary productivity of the system lam et al 2009 rütting et al 2011 silver et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 bonaglia et al 2016 shan et al 2016 however in freshwater ecosystems dnra is probably an important contributor to eutrophication because the rates of nh4 promoted algal growth and eutrophication are significantly higher than that of no3 von rückert et al 2004 scott et al 2008 nogaro and burgin 2014 at present dnra studies are mostly concentrated to marine and estuarine wetland sediments bonin et al 1998 welsh et al 2001 an and gardner 2002 ketil and giblin 2010 dunn et al 2013 deng et al 2015 hardison et al 2015 cao et al 2016 schutte et al 2018 and soils yin et al 2002 sgouridis et al 2011 sanford et al 2012 lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 shan et al 2016 in contrast the dnra rate microbial community distribution and contribution of the associated bacteria in freshwater ecosystems are still poorly understood the interface between two adjacent ecosystems is often hot zones for biogeochemical cycles riparian zones which are transitional boundary zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems play important roles in regulating landscape level interactions in the vertical transversal and longitudinal geometry of the three dimensional space naiman and décamps 1997 yin et al 2006 furthermore these zones have long been regarded as biogeochemical hotspots for nitrogen cycling with high rates of oxygen consumption anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox and denitrification zhu et al 2013 kim et al 2016 wang et al 2018 similar to the denitrification and anammox process dnra also reduces no3 and no2 under anoxic anaerobic conditions conversely the nh4 generated during this process is subsequently oxidized to no3 by nitrifying microorganisms allowing the recycling of substrates necessary for these processes dnra is an important intermediate of the n cycle and links n compound oxidation and reduction processes on the basis of the studies described above we hypothesize that riparian zones are hotspots of dnra with high abundances of dnra bacteria and high rates of dnra process interestingly in a regional scale study kim et al 2016 found higher abundances and rates of n cycling microbes including dnra in riparian sediments than those in the stream of a river tributary similarity in our previous studies on the micro and site scale dnra was also found to play important roles in the riparian zones both in the reed rhizosphere wang et al 2019a and the groundwater zones wang et al 2019b on the basis of these studies described above we hypothesize that the riparian zone is the hotspot of dnra with a high abundance of dnra bacteria and a high rate of dnra process nevertheless until now there was still no evidence about the global and temporal scale of the dnra hotspot and the relevant microbial mechanism in riparian zones as such this study explored the occurrence distribution contribution and biogeochemistry of the dnra process in riparian zones using an isotopic tracing technique functional gene expression and high throughput sequencing analysis the hypothesis was first tested using riparian zone samples collected globally after the global survey was conducted we selected baiyangdian lake as the site to further assess the hypothesis in detail finally then the biogeochemical mechanisms governing dnra in riparian zones were further analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site background global scale this study first tested if riparian zones act as hotspots of dnra on a global scale using extensive global sampling over six continents a total of 30 surface sediment samples equal 15 samples from the riparian zone and open water sediment separately

indicators such as different temperatures nitrogen compound concentrations and organic matter concentrations these samples were used to collect spatial evidence for the occurrence and distribution of dnra bacteria in global wetlands temporal scale after the global survey was conducted we further selected baiyangdian lake the largest natural freshwater lake in north china with well developed riparian zones as the research site to assess the hotspot hypothesis on a temporal scale furthermore we investigated the driving forces influencing dnra hotspot zones the characteristics of baiyangdian lake have been described in our previous publications zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2019a given the high heterogeneity of the landscape water quality section of riparian zones microbial biodiversity and rate at fine scale in the riparian zones four typical riparian zones sites a b c and d were selected as sampling sites the four sites were sampled monthly during the winter december

16 15n atom or na15no2 99 17 15n atom were added to the glass vials to final concentrations of approximately 2 10 μm the potential rate of dnra no3 nh4 was assessed as the 15nh4 production rate converting 15nh4 to 30n2 with hypobromite füssel et al 2012 song et al 2016 the potential rates of other n cycling processes were investigated using methods described by risgaard petersen et al 2003 and füssel et al 2012 briefly anammox and denitrification rates were separately determined using the yields of 29n2 and 30n2 respectively produced via 15no3 nh4 oxidation nh4 no2 and no3 reduction no3 no2 rates were measured as the 15no2 production rates from incubations with 15nh4 and 15no3 respectively via the reduction of 15no2 with sulfamic acid to 29n2 the no2 oxidation no2 no3 rate was determined as the 15no3 production rate which was converted to 15no2 using spongy cadmium and then further reduced to 29n2 with sulfamic acid the 29n2 or 30n2 produced using the processes above were

sites 15 open water and 15 riparian zone samples n 30 in freshwater wetland sediments around the world fig 1 a these samples represent a range of environmental factors including different geochemical properties soil types organic matter content n compound concentrations and temperature supplementary table s1 in the riparian sediments the mean concentration of nh4 no2 and tc were all lower than those in open water sediments while tom showed the opposite trend paired t test all p 0 05 no3 showed little difference between the riparian and open water sediments p 0 1 thus the tc nh4 and tc nox no2 plus no3 also showed higher values in the riparian zone than those in the open water sediments although the differences were not significant both p 0 1 in addition the higher concentration of n and c compounds were mostly found in lake sediments following by pond and river sediments and finally in reservoir sediments the qpcr results showed that the dnra nrfa gene had widespread occurrence with abundances ranging from 2 20 0 07 107 to 9 08 0 28 108 copies g 1 fig 1 b in every sampling site the abundance of dnra bacteria in the riparian zone 4 19 3 36 108 copies g 1 n 15 was significantly higher than in the open water sediment 1 26 0 93 108 copies g 1 n 15 t 3 249 p 0 003 0 01 the abundance was maximized in a lake riparian zone kc furthermore we analyzed the dnra rate using 15n isotopic tracing technology with a wide range of 9 0 53 6 nmol n g 1 h 1 the dnra rates were also higher in riparian sediments 28 0 10 4 nmol n g 1 h 1 than those in open water sediments 14 4 3 7 nmol n g 1 h 1 t 4 771 p 0 001 both rda and spearman correlation analysis showed that the dnra abundance was significantly positively correlated with tom spearman r 0 826 p 0 001 and tc no2 r 0 394 p 0 031 but negative trend with tn r 0 595 p 0 001 which were the similar correlation relationships with dnra rate r 0 444 p 0 014 for tom r 0 429 p 0 019 for tc no2 r 0 432 p 0 017 for tn fig 1 c supplementary table s3 besides the dnra abundances showed an interesting negative correlated with latitude r 0 560 p 0 001 but little correlation with longitude r 0 072 p 0 705 while the rate showed no obviously correlated with the geographic location both p 0 05 thus the molecular and isotopic results preliminarily confirmed that the riparian zone sediments contain a higher abundance and rate of dnra bacteria 3 2 temporal evidence for dnra hotspot in typical riparian zone sediments after the global survey was conducted we selected baiyangdian lake as a typical riparian zone to assess our hypothesis in detail fig 2 a supplementary fig s1 the seasonal variation in physicochemical properties of the baiyangdian wetland sediments in the riparian zone and open water are shown in

sediments were always higher than those in the riparian zone p 0 001 for nh4 no2 and tn p 0 05 for no3 and others p 0 05 in contrast the means values of tom tc nh4 and tc no2 showed opposite trends and significant differences both between seasons winter summer and sampling zones riparian zone open water all p 0 05 for fe ii 8 62 1 03 23 44 2 61 mg kg 1 and fe iii 39 34 4 72 70 22 8 43 mg kg 1 the concentrations in open water sediments were higher than the riparian zone and the seasonal variation was not significant similar to the global scale studies the abundance of dnra bacteria in the riparian zone 5 27 2 29 108 copies g 1 n 24 was still significantly higher than the open water sediment 2 67 1 49 108 copies g 1 n 24 t 4 655 p 0 001 fig 2 b furthermore the abundance was higher in the summer 5 62 2 02 108 copies g 1 n 24 than in the winter 2 32 1 10 108 copies g 1 n 24 t 7 005 p 0 001 a similar trend was also detected in the dnra rate during different seasons the dnra rate in the riparian zone 30 1 12 2 nmol n g 1 h 1 n 24 was significantly higher than in the open water sediment 17 1 9 8 nmol n g 1 h 1 n 24 t 4 093 p 0 001 and the rate in the summer 28 7 13 5 nmol n g 1 h 1 n 24 was higher than that in the winter 18 4 9 7 nmol n g 1 h 1 n 24 t 3 034 p 0 004 0 01 rda and correlation analysis showed that the dnra rate was positively correlated with the dnra bacterial abundance r 0 597 p 0 001 tom r 0 818 p 0 001 and c n ratio r 0 508 p 0 045 for tc nh4 and r 0 606 p 0 013 for tc no2 supplementary fig s3 table s4 similar to the global survey the abundance of dnra bacteria was significantly correlated with tom r 0 532 p 0 034 3 3 dnra bacterial community in sediments of the riparian zone and open water the significant difference in the dnra rate and abundance promoted us to investigate the dnra bacterial community in sediments of the riparian zone and open water high throughput sequencing analysis showed that all the sequences after quality controlled were nrfa gene from dnra bacteria fig 3 supplementary fig s4 table s5 dnra bacterial diversity indices in the riparian zones were not significantly different from those in open water sediments t test all p 0 05 the relative abundance and heatmap analysis also showed that there was no significant difference in the dnra community structure between sediments from the riparian zone and open water cluster and pcoa analyses showed the dnra community in the riparian zone and open water sediments from the same site were clustered first and then distinctly clustered according to seasons fig 3 a b supplementary fig s3 this indicates that the season variation has a greater influence on the dnra bacterial community than the sampling site which is consistent with the above result showing that species diversity of the summer samples was higher than the winter the genus level analysis showed that the dominant genera were anaeromyxobacter 35 11 of the otus lacunisphaera 12 86 sorangium 11 99 actinomyces 5 9 geobacter 5 6 and petrimonas 5 8 while others all less than 5 fig 3 a supplementary table s6 statistical analysis showed that the most dominant strain anaeromyxobacter had a positive and significant correlation with nh4 r 0 732 p 0 001 and no2 r 0 724 p 0 002 while the genera actinomyces significantly correlated with no2 r 0 569 p 0 021 and tc no2 r 0 567 p 0 022 respectively fig 3 c supplementary table s6 however there was no positive correlation between the dnra rate and abundance of the dominant genera anaeromyxobacter lacunisphaera and sorangium in contrast genera of relatively small proportion such as actinomyces syntrophus and the unclassified group had positive and significant correlations with dnra rate all p 0 05 finally there was no significant and positive correlation between a definite dnra bacteria with the dnra abundance 3 4 co occurrence patterns of dnra bacteria in sediments of the riparian zone and open water the bacterial co occurrence patterns of dnra bacteria in the riparian zone and open water were investigated using network analysis based on strong significant correlations fig 4 the riparian zone network had 247 nodes connected by 757 edges with an r 2 of 0 54 the genera caldimicrobium otu 5 and lacunisphaera otu 162 had the maximum connected degree the open water sediment network had 233 nodes connected by 891 edges with r 2 of 0 53 the genus archangium otu 102 had the maximum connected degree through topological analyses most of the network nodes were in the peripheral and no nodes were in the network hub in the riparian zone network there was only one connector annotated as geobacter and two module hubs that were annotated as caldimicrobium and lacunisphaera moreover caldimicrobium and lacunisphaera were not only the most connected nodes in the network but also existed in the z p diagram of the module hubs indicating that these taxa were the key genera in the open water sediment network there was also one connector anaeromyxobacter and two module hubs which were labeled as sorangium although archangium was the most connected in the network it was in the peripheral so it was not a key genus the genera anaeromyxobacter and sorangium played an important role between modules and within their respective modules respectively 3 5 potential interactions between dnra and other n cycle processes further studies were conducted to resolve how dnra process rates compare to other n cycle processes in the riparian zone and open water sediment under significant do difference no2 is the key intermediate in microbial n cycling processes hence we determined the no2 conversion rate of several possible n cycle processes anammox denitrification no2 oxidation and dnra and the no2 production rate nh4 oxidation and no3 reduction via the 15n isotopic pairing technique fig 5 in the riparian zone the do content 0 20 0 05 mg l 1 was relatively low because of the high tom content 20 98 2 42 mg kg 1 hence the nh4 oxidation rate in the riparian zone 7 60 1 08 mmol n m 2 d 1 was lower than that in the open water sediment 14 73 1 58 mmol n m 2 d 1 although do was relatively low the rate of no2 oxidation was higher both in the riparian zone 39 80 4 70 mmol n g 1 h 1 and open water sediment 42 49 4 66 mmol n g 1 h 1 because no2 oxidation can occur in the presence of trace amounts of oxygen bristow et al 2016 under oxygen limited conditions no3 reduction provides energy for the entire n cycle zhu et al 2019 in the riparian zone with higher no3 reduction rates 40 91 4 86 mmol n g 1 h 1 the rates of dnra anammox and denitrification were all higher than those in the open water sediment as the main no3 reduction process dnra reduced no3 to nh4 at a higher rate 35 28 5 56 mmol n g 1 h 1 in the presence of higher tom and no3 concentrations which was even more than the rates of denitrification 27 09 4 21 mmol n g 1 h 1 and anammox 12 02 2 15 mmol n g 1 h 1 in the riparian zone hence the dnra rate was positively correlated with the tom and nh4 concentrations in all the no2 oxidation which produced substrate no3 for dnra and no3 reduction which produced energy for dnra promoted a higher dnra rate in the riparian sediments 4 discussions mankind is transforming the global nitrogen cycle at a record pace through increased combustion of fossil fuels and an increased demand for nitrogen in agriculture and industry galloway et al 2008 much of this anthropogenic nitrogen is lost to the environment and causes an increase in freshwater nitrate levels and increased nitrous oxide production that may enhance global climate change duce et al 2008 in addition to effective political action a better understanding of the microorganisms that are involved in nitrogen transformation is necessary to understand and eventually counteract the negative effects of nitrogen pollution as a dissimilatory reduction process dnra is different from the anammox and denitrification processes when nitrate is converted to n2 by denitrification and anammox n is permanently removed with n2 as the end product however a large amount of no3 is not removed by anammox and denitrification instead of producing nh4 through the dnra process this nh4 can enter the water body and accelerate eutrophication von rückert et al 2004 and promotes the production of a large amount of n2o groffman et al 2000 hefting et al 2006 wang et al 2006 kool et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 therefore the dnra process is a very important internal link in the n conversion process to our knowledge this study is the first to report the dnra hotspot in global and temporal scale freshwater ecosystems in this study the dnra bacterial abundance 108 copies g 1 and rate 32 38 2 21 nmol n g 1 h 1 in riparian zone sediments were in the relatively wide range of that the previously reported values in estuarine and freshwater sediments 2 2 25 1 nmol n g 1 h 1 song et al 2014 40 nmol n g 1 h 1 decleyre et al 2015 0 03 0 54 nmol n g 1 h 1 shan et al 2016 to investigate the mechanism of dnra in the riparian zone hotspot the rates of different microbial n cycle processes that co occur with dnra were measured and it was also confirmed that the reaction rates in the riparian sediments were higher than those in the open water ones the key point is that the higher internal circulation rate of nitrite oxidation and nitrate reduction in the riparian zone due to both lower environmental requirement of themselves i e nanomole o2 bristow et al 2016 füssel et al 2012 and the higher tom in the riparian zone thus the above two processes could provide available substrate no3 and efficient energy for dnra microbes and process respectively as an important result dnra is maintained at a higher rate in the riparian zone although dnra does not contribute to n loss the potential rates and relative contributions of dnra to total nitrate reduction in the current study exhibited a wide range 0 03 0 54 nmol n g 1 h 1 and dominated the no3 reduction over anammox and denitrification suggesting that the dnra rate is also highly variable throughout the riparian zone and open water sediment generally dnra is considered to have a higher rate in no3 limited conditions even higher than denitrification because dnra bacteria can accept eight instead of five electrons per no3 molecule tiedje 1988 jørgensen et al 1989 kraft et al 2014 however in this study the no3 levels in open water sediments were higher than those in the riparian zone therefore no3 was not a limiting factor rysgaard et al 1996 alternatively the carbon source may be responsible for the higher dnra rates previous data showed that the dnra rates in soils across different ecosystems are significantly related to tn c no3 and c n ratio chen et al 2015 shan et al 2016 in this study the dnra abundance and rates were also positively significantly correlated with tom tc nh4 and tc no2 these correlations promoted the dnra rate because dnra bacteria use electron acceptors i e no3 more efficiently when the labile c availability is high and no3 is limited tiedje 1988 in addition the ratio of extractable organic c eoc no3 more strongly influenced the dnra rates than c n ratio shan et al 2016 and ext c also showed more positive correlation with dnra abundance than tc kim et al 2016 li et al 2019 studied the effects of various c types on dnra using diverse statistical analyses in their study total and dissolved organic c toc and doc showed a close relationship with dnra while the labile oxidized organic c loc exhibited a discrepant relationship therefore the influence of c compositions on dnra needs to be further studied anammox bacteria also perform dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium kartal et al 2013 however in this study the high rate of dnra should not be attributed to the anammox process isotope tracing has revealed the mechanism of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium during anammox when the ammonia substrate becomes a limiting factor anammox reduces 15no3 to 15nh4 with 15no2 as the intermediate followed by the anaerobic oxidation of the produced ammonium and nitrite the overall end product of anammox bacterial metabolism is 15n15n dinitrogen gas that is to say the nh4 produced during anammox bacteria will also be utilized by anammox bacteria in addition the substrate concentration in the incubation vials was about 8 41 mg n kg 1 soil which was 2 3 orders higher than the microbial rate with only 0 014 mg n kg 1 soil h 1 meaning that the substrate was sufficient to support all microbial processes thus the potential influence from the change of substrate nh4 or no3 due to the dnra and anammox processes can be ignored high throughput sequencing analysis showed that there was no correlation among the top three dominant genera anaeromyxobacter lacunisphaera and sorangium with the dnra rate and total abundance network analysis showed that caldimicrobium and lacunisphaera were the key connectors in the riparian hotspot however rda and correlation analysis showed that neither rate nor abundance was related to the two key genera the key genus caldimicrobium is an extremely thermophilic strictly anaerobic facultatively chemolithoautotrophic bacterium it not only possesses the nrfa gene but can also grow chemolithoautotrophically with molecular hydrogen in the presence of thiosulfate or elemental sulfur subsequently forming h2s miroshnichenko et al 2009 generally under sulfate rich anoxic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria are metabolically active and versatile with the ability to perform dnra through secondary metabolism resulting in increased dnra rates kimura 2000 an and gardner 2002 furthermore sulfide the product of sulfate reduction enhances dnra by serving as a potential

robertson et al 2016 li et al 2019 even under oxic conditions roberts et al 2014 however in this study both the rda and correlation analysis showed that neither the dnra rates nor the dnra abundance had a positive relationship with sediment sulfate concentrations or fe ii lacunisphaera which has a peptidoglycan cell wall is a novel species in the new genus lacunisphaera gen nov family opitutaceae subdivision verrucomicrobial recently isolated from a freshwater lake rast et al 2017 it is not yet clear if this microorganism has the dnra function numerous studies and our previous researches reported the activities of n cycling processes were not positively correlated with the abundances of the related microorganisms but affected by the environmental factors the rate of dnra varied with nutrient gradient dong et al 2009 lu et al 2015 soil c n ratio and sulfate concentration shan et al 2016 glucose and free sulfide lu et al 2013 or soil ph zhang et al 2015 aoa and aob in wetland sediments with nh4 concentration wang et al 2011 anammox with no2 zhu et al 2013 and moisture content wang et al 2019a and denitrifier nosz ii in lake sediment with tom zhao et al 2018 in this study although the rate and abundance of dnra in the riparian zone were significantly higher than those in open water sediments there is no significant difference in the dnra bacterial community between open water and riparian zone sediments hence the higher dnra rate in the riparian zone might be attributed to the combined effect of various influencing factors moreover the influence of geochemical parameters may be greater than that of microbial processes which is consistence with the statement that the environmental controls that govern the end product of bacterial nitrate respiration kraft et al 2014 in the field of wetland ecology this result also provides some insight into the currently applied human management practices versus the less anthropogenically influenced systems we know that both nh4 and no3 are important nitrogen sources for plant growth and that common wetland plants generally have a higher uptake capacity v max by approximately 16 and a higher affinity low k t for nh4 compared to no3 tylova munzarova et al 2005 fang et al 2007 on the other hand the positively charged nh4 is more beneficial for adsorbing negatively charged soil colloid particles therefore the leaching rate of no3 is several or even dozens of times higher than nh4 allowing the leaching process to occur from surface water to groundwater resulting in no3 pollution riley et al 2001 most importantly the higher no3 accumulation could trigger a massive release of n2o therefore enhancement of the dnra process is beneficial for the retention of ammonium fertilizer in the riparian zone as well as for the reduction of no3 flux into the groundwater and n2o emission in the present study the interface sediments in the riparian zone represent the hotspot of dnra this result provides valuable information for the management of riparian zones anthropogenic changes in the riparian water table are expected to increase with subsequent changes in the reduction from no3 to nh4 this could significantly impact the cumulative n budget at a given location thereby bridging global changes and local management practices 5 conclusion both global and temporal scale results confirmed that dnra was widespread in the various sediments and the higher abundance and rate of dnra were found in riparian zone sediments rather than open water sediment dnra rate and abundance were positively correlated with the environmental controls tom and c n ratios tc nh4 and tc no2 but not with the most dominant genera anaeromyxobacter lacunisphaera and sorangium high throughput sequencing and network analyses showed that there were similar diversity and community structure of dnra bacteria between riparian zone and open water sediments but different key connectors in the related networks of dnra genera with caldimicrobium and lacunisphaera in the riparian sediments but anaeromyxobacter and sorangium in the open water ones in the dnra hotspot the n cycling processes were higher than those in the open water sediments the rates of dnra no3 reduction and no2 oxidation were more than the rates of denitrification and anammox in all the no2 oxidation which produced substrate no3 for dnra and no3 reduction which produced energy for dnra promoted a higher dnra rate in the riparian sediments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18125,dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra an important intermediate process in the n cycle links n compound oxidation and reduction processes hence the oxic anoxic interface would be the hotspot of the dnra process in freshwater ecosystems the riparian zone is the most typical carrier of the oxic anoxic interface here we report spatio temporal evidence of a higher abundance and rate of dnra in the riparian zone than in the open water sediments based on molecular and 15n isotopic tracing technologies hence signifying a hotspot for the dnra process these abudance and rates were significantly higher than those in open water sediments 15n isotopic paring technology revealed that the dnra hotspot promoted higher rates of n compound oxidation no2 reduction no3 and dnra and n2 production anammox and denitrification in the riparian zone than those in open water sediment however high through sequencing analysis showed that the dnra bacteria in the riparian zone and openwater sediments were insignificantly different network and correlation analysis showed that the dnra abundance and rates were significantly positively correlated with tom tc nh4 and tc no2 but not with the dominant genera anaeromyxobacter lacunisphaera and sorangium which played different roles on the connection in the respective community networks the dnra process in the riparian zone could be driven mainly by the related environmental biogeochemical characteristics induced by anthropogenic changes followed by microbial processes this result provides valuable information for the management of riparian zones because anthropogenic changes in the riparian water table are expected to increase inducing consequent changes in the reduction from no3 to nh4 graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra hotspot riparian zone c n ratio nutrients circulation 1 introduction nitrogen n cycling is driven by microorganisms specifically nitrifying microorganisms oxidize excess ammonium via nitrite to nitrate and denitrifying microorganisms return the oxidized nitrogen species back to n2 thereby closing the cycle jetten 2008 nitrate which is a

products i e greenhouse gas n2o and toxic substance no2 peng and zhu 2006 jetten 2008 kraft et al 2014 nitrate is mainly reduced to nitrogen gas n2 via denitrification process but also to ammonium via the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process dnra competes with denitrification for no3 with end products of nh4 since the dominance of these two pathways is determined by the environment kraft et al 2014 lu et al 2015 the roles drivers and underlying mechanisms of dnra are significantly different among ecosystems sanford et al 2012 roberts et al 2014 chen et al 2015 in oligotrophic marine and soil systems dnra produces nh4 to improve primary productivity of the system lam et al 2009 rütting et al 2011 silver et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 bonaglia et al 2016 shan et al 2016 however in freshwater ecosystems dnra is probably an important contributor to eutrophication because the rates of nh4 promoted algal growth and eutrophication are significantly higher than that of no3 von rückert et al 2004 scott et al 2008 nogaro and burgin 2014 at present dnra studies are mostly concentrated to marine and estuarine wetland sediments bonin et al 1998 welsh et al 2001 an and gardner 2002 ketil and giblin 2010 dunn et al 2013 deng et al 2015 hardison et al 2015 cao et al 2016 schutte et al 2018 and soils yin et al 2002 sgouridis et al 2011 sanford et al 2012 lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 shan et al 2016 in contrast the dnra rate microbial community distribution and contribution of the associated bacteria in freshwater ecosystems are still poorly understood the interface between two adjacent ecosystems is often hot zones for biogeochemical cycles riparian zones which are transitional boundary zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems play important roles in regulating landscape level interactions in the vertical transversal and longitudinal geometry of the three dimensional space naiman and décamps 1997 yin et al 2006 furthermore these zones have long been regarded as biogeochemical hotspots for nitrogen cycling with high rates of oxygen consumption anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox and denitrification zhu et al 2013 kim et al 2016 wang et al 2018 similar to the denitrification and anammox process dnra also reduces no3 and no2 under anoxic anaerobic conditions conversely the nh4 generated during this process is subsequently oxidized to no3 by nitrifying microorganisms allowing the recycling of substrates necessary for these processes dnra is an important intermediate of the n cycle and links n compound oxidation and reduction processes on the basis of the studies described above we hypothesize that riparian zones are hotspots of dnra with high abundances of dnra bacteria and high rates of dnra process interestingly in a regional scale study kim et al 2016 found higher abundances and rates of n cycling microbes including dnra in riparian sediments than those in the stream of a river tributary similarity in our previous studies on the micro and site scale dnra was also found to play important roles in the riparian zones both in the reed rhizosphere wang et al 2019a and the groundwater zones wang et al 2019b on the basis of these studies described above we hypothesize that the riparian zone is the hotspot of dnra with a high abundance of dnra bacteria and a high rate of dnra process nevertheless until now there was still no evidence about the global and temporal scale of the dnra hotspot and the relevant microbial mechanism in riparian zones as such this study explored the occurrence distribution contribution and biogeochemistry of the dnra process in riparian zones using an isotopic tracing technique functional gene expression and high throughput sequencing analysis the hypothesis was first tested using riparian zone samples collected globally after the global survey was conducted we selected baiyangdian lake as the site to further assess the hypothesis in detail finally then the biogeochemical mechanisms governing dnra in riparian zones were further analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site background global scale this study first tested if riparian zones act as hotspots of dnra on a global scale using extensive global sampling over six continents a total of 30 surface sediment samples equal 15 samples from the riparian zone and open water sediment separately

indicators such as different temperatures nitrogen compound concentrations and organic matter concentrations these samples were used to collect spatial evidence for the occurrence and distribution of dnra bacteria in global wetlands temporal scale after the global survey was conducted we further selected baiyangdian lake the largest natural freshwater lake in north china with well developed riparian zones as the research site to assess the hotspot hypothesis on a temporal scale furthermore we investigated the driving forces influencing dnra hotspot zones the characteristics of baiyangdian lake have been described in our previous publications zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2019a given the high heterogeneity of the landscape water quality section of riparian zones microbial biodiversity and rate at fine scale in the riparian zones four typical riparian zones sites a b c and d were selected as sampling sites the four sites were sampled monthly during the winter december

properties soil types organic matter content n compound concentrations and temperature supplementary table s1 in the riparian sediments the mean concentration of nh4 no2 and tc were all lower than those in open water sediments while tom showed the opposite trend paired t test all p 0 05 no3 showed little difference between the riparian and open water sediments p 0 1 thus the tc nh4 and tc nox no2 plus no3 also showed higher values in the riparian zone than those in the open water sediments although the differences were not significant both p 0 1 in addition the higher concentration of n and c compounds were mostly found in lake sediments following by pond and river sediments and finally in reservoir sediments the qpcr results showed that the dnra nrfa gene had widespread occurrence with abundances ranging from 2 20 0 07 107 to 9 08 0 28 108 copies g 1 fig 1 b in every sampling site the abundance of dnra bacteria in the riparian zone 4 19 3 36 108 copies g 1 n 15 was

supplementary table s3 besides the dnra abundances showed an interesting negative correlated with latitude r 0 560 p 0 001 but little correlation with longitude r 0 072 p 0 705 while the rate showed no obviously correlated with the geographic location both p 0 05 thus the molecular and isotopic results preliminarily confirmed that the riparian zone sediments contain a higher abundance and rate of dnra bacteria 3 2 temporal evidence for dnra hotspot in typical riparian zone sediments after the global survey was conducted we selected baiyangdian lake as a typical riparian zone to assess our hypothesis in detail fig 2 a supplementary fig s1 the seasonal variation in physicochemical properties of the baiyangdian wetland sediments in the riparian zone and open water are shown in

sediments were always higher than those in the riparian zone p 0 001 for nh4 no2 and tn p 0 05 for no3 and others p 0 05 in contrast the means values of tom tc nh4 and tc no2 showed opposite trends and significant differences both between seasons winter summer and sampling zones riparian zone open water all p 0 05 for fe ii 8 62 1 03 23 44 2 61 mg kg 1 and fe iii 39 34 4 72 70 22 8 43 mg kg 1 the concentrations in open water sediments were higher than the riparian zone and the seasonal variation was not significant similar to the global scale studies the abundance of dnra bacteria in the riparian zone 5 27 2 29 108 copies g 1 n 24 was still significantly higher than the open water sediment 2 67 1 49 108 copies g 1 n 24 t 4 655 p 0 001 fig 2 b furthermore the abundance was higher in the summer 5 62 2 02 108 copies g 1 n 24 than in the winter 2 32 1 10 108 copies g 1 n 24 t 7 005 p 0 001 a similar trend was also detected in the dnra rate during different seasons the dnra rate in the riparian zone 30 1 12 2 nmol n g 1 h 1 n 24 was significantly higher than in the open water sediment 17 1 9 8 nmol n g 1 h 1 n 24 t 4 093 p 0 001 and the rate in the summer 28 7 13 5 nmol n g 1 h

abundance r 0 597 p 0 001 tom r 0 818 p 0 001 and c n ratio r 0 508 p 0 045 for tc nh4 and r 0 606 p 0 013 for tc no2 supplementary fig s3 table s4 similar to the global survey the abundance of dnra bacteria was significantly correlated with tom r 0 532 p 0 034 3 3 dnra bacterial community in sediments of the riparian zone and open water the significant difference in the dnra rate and abundance promoted us to investigate the dnra bacterial community in sediments of the riparian zone and open water high throughput sequencing analysis showed that all the sequences after quality controlled were nrfa gene from dnra bacteria fig 3 supplementary fig s4 table s5 dnra bacterial diversity indices in the riparian zones were not significantly different from those in open water sediments t test all p 0 05 the relative abundance and heatmap analysis also showed that there was no significant difference in the dnra community structure between sediments from the riparian zone and open water cluster and pcoa analyses showed the dnra community in the riparian zone and open water sediments from the same site were clustered first and then distinctly clustered according to seasons fig 3 a b supplementary fig s3 this indicates that the season variation has a greater influence on the dnra bacterial community than the sampling site which is consistent with the above result showing that species diversity of the summer samples was higher than the winter the genus level analysis showed that the dominant genera were anaeromyxobacter 35 11 of the otus lacunisphaera 12 86 sorangium 11 99 actinomyces 5 9 geobacter 5 6 and petrimonas 5 8 while others all less than 5 fig 3 a supplementary table s6 statistical analysis showed that the most dominant strain anaeromyxobacter had a positive and significant correlation with nh4 r 0 732 p 0 001 and no2 r 0 724 p 0 002 while the genera actinomyces significantly correlated with no2 r 0 569 p 0 021 and tc no2 r 0 567 p 0 022 respectively fig 3 c supplementary table s6 however there was no positive correlation between the dnra rate and abundance of the dominant genera anaeromyxobacter lacunisphaera and sorangium in contrast genera of relatively small proportion such as actinomyces syntrophus and the unclassified group had positive and significant correlations with dnra rate all p 0 05 finally there was no significant and positive correlation between a definite dnra bacteria with the dnra abundance 3 4 co occurrence patterns of dnra bacteria in sediments of the riparian zone and open water the bacterial co occurrence patterns of dnra bacteria in the riparian zone and open water were investigated using network analysis based on strong significant correlations fig 4 the riparian zone network had 247 nodes connected by 757 edges with an r 2 of 0 54 the genera caldimicrobium otu 5 and lacunisphaera otu 162 had the maximum connected degree the open water sediment network had 233 nodes connected by 891 edges with r 2 of 0 53 the genus archangium otu 102 had the maximum connected degree through topological analyses most of the network nodes were in the peripheral and no nodes were in the network hub in the riparian zone network there was only one connector annotated as geobacter and two module hubs that were annotated as caldimicrobium and lacunisphaera moreover caldimicrobium and lacunisphaera were not only the most connected nodes in the network but also existed in the z p diagram of the module hubs indicating that these taxa were the key genera in the open water sediment network there was also one connector anaeromyxobacter and two module hubs which were labeled as sorangium although archangium was the most connected in the network it was in the peripheral so it was not a key genus the genera anaeromyxobacter and sorangium played an important role between modules and within their respective modules respectively 3 5 potential interactions between dnra and other n cycle processes further studies were conducted to resolve how dnra process rates compare to other n cycle processes in the riparian zone and open water sediment under significant do difference no2 is the key intermediate in microbial n cycling processes hence we determined the no2 conversion rate of several possible n cycle processes anammox denitrification no2 oxidation and dnra and the no2 production rate nh4 oxidation and no3 reduction via the 15n isotopic pairing technique fig 5 in the riparian zone the do content 0 20 0 05 mg l 1 was relatively low because of the high tom content 20 98 2 42 mg kg 1 hence the nh4 oxidation rate in the riparian zone 7 60 1 08 mmol n m 2 d 1 was lower than that in the open water sediment 14 73 1 58 mmol n m 2 d 1 although do was relatively low the rate of no2 oxidation was higher both in the riparian zone 39 80 4 70 mmol n g 1 h 1 and open water sediment 42 49 4 66 mmol n g 1 h 1 because no2 oxidation can occur in the presence of trace amounts of oxygen bristow et al 2016 under oxygen limited conditions no3 reduction provides energy for the entire n cycle zhu et al 2019 in the riparian zone with higher no3 reduction rates 40 91 4 86 mmol n g 1 h 1 the rates of dnra anammox and denitrification were all higher than those in the open water sediment as the main no3 reduction process dnra reduced no3 to nh4 at a higher rate 35 28 5 56 mmol n g 1 h 1 in the presence of higher tom and no3 concentrations which was even more than the rates of denitrification 27 09 4 21 mmol n g 1 h 1 and anammox 12 02 2 15 mmol n g 1 h 1 in the riparian zone hence the dnra rate was positively correlated with the tom and nh4 concentrations in all the no2 oxidation which produced substrate no3 for dnra and no3 reduction which produced energy for dnra promoted a higher dnra rate in the riparian sediments 4 discussions mankind is transforming the global nitrogen cycle at a record pace through increased combustion of fossil fuels and an increased demand for nitrogen in agriculture and industry galloway et al 2008 much of this anthropogenic nitrogen is lost to the environment and causes an increase in freshwater nitrate levels and increased nitrous oxide production that may enhance global climate change duce et al 2008 in addition to effective political action a better understanding of the microorganisms that are involved in nitrogen transformation is necessary to understand and eventually counteract the negative effects of nitrogen pollution as a dissimilatory reduction process dnra is different from the anammox and denitrification processes when nitrate is converted to n2 by denitrification and anammox n is permanently removed with n2 as the end product however a large amount of no3 is not removed by anammox and denitrification instead of producing nh4 through the dnra process this nh4 can enter the water body and accelerate eutrophication von rückert et al 2004 and promotes the production of a large amount of n2o groffman et al 2000 hefting et al 2006 wang et al 2006 kool et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 therefore the dnra process is a very important internal link in the n conversion process to our knowledge this study is the first to report the dnra hotspot in global and temporal scale freshwater ecosystems in this study the dnra bacterial abundance 108 copies g 1 and rate 32 38 2 21 nmol n g 1 h 1 in riparian zone sediments were in the relatively wide range of that the previously reported values in estuarine and freshwater sediments 2 2 25 1 nmol n g 1 h 1 song et al 2014 40 nmol n g 1 h 1 decleyre et al 2015 0 03 0 54 nmol n g 1 h 1 shan et al 2016 to investigate the mechanism of dnra in the riparian zone hotspot the rates of different microbial n cycle processes that co occur with dnra were measured and it was also confirmed that the reaction rates in the riparian sediments were higher than those in the open water ones the key point is that the higher internal circulation rate of nitrite oxidation and nitrate reduction in the riparian zone due to both lower environmental requirement of themselves i e nanomole o2 bristow et al 2016 füssel et al 2012 and the higher tom in the riparian zone thus the above two processes could provide available substrate no3 and efficient energy for dnra microbes and process respectively as an important result dnra is maintained at a higher rate in the riparian zone although dnra does not contribute to n loss the potential rates and relative contributions of dnra to total nitrate reduction in the current study exhibited a wide range 0 03 0 54 nmol n g 1 h 1 and dominated the no3 reduction over anammox and denitrification suggesting that the dnra rate is also highly variable throughout the riparian zone and open water sediment generally dnra is considered to have a higher rate in no3 limited conditions even higher than denitrification because dnra bacteria can accept eight instead of five electrons per no3 molecule tiedje 1988 jørgensen et al 1989 kraft et al 2014 however in this study the no3 levels in open water sediments were higher than those in the riparian zone therefore no3 was not a limiting factor rysgaard et al 1996 alternatively the carbon source may be responsible for the higher dnra rates previous data showed that the dnra rates in soils across different ecosystems are significantly related to tn c no3 and c n ratio chen et al 2015 shan et al 2016 in this study the dnra abundance and rates were also positively significantly correlated with tom tc nh4 and tc no2 these correlations promoted the dnra rate because dnra bacteria use electron acceptors i e no3 more efficiently when the labile c availability is high and no3 is limited tiedje 1988 in addition the ratio of extractable organic c eoc no3 more strongly influenced the dnra rates than c n ratio shan et al 2016 and ext c also showed more positive correlation with dnra abundance than tc kim et al 2016 li et al 2019 studied the effects of various c types on dnra using diverse statistical analyses in their study total and dissolved organic c toc and doc showed a close relationship with dnra while the labile oxidized organic c loc exhibited a discrepant relationship therefore the influence of c compositions on dnra needs to be further studied anammox bacteria also perform dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium kartal et al 2013 however in this study the high rate of dnra should not be attributed to the anammox process isotope tracing has revealed the mechanism of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium during anammox when the ammonia substrate becomes a limiting factor anammox reduces 15no3 to 15nh4 with 15no2 as the intermediate followed by the anaerobic oxidation of the produced ammonium and nitrite the overall end product of anammox bacterial metabolism is 15n15n dinitrogen gas that is to say the nh4 produced during anammox bacteria will also be utilized by anammox bacteria in addition the substrate concentration in the incubation vials was about 8 41 mg n kg 1 soil which was 2 3 orders higher than the microbial rate with only 0 014 mg n kg 1 soil h 1 meaning that the substrate was sufficient to support all microbial processes thus the potential influence from the change of substrate nh4 or no3 due to the dnra and anammox processes can be ignored high throughput sequencing analysis showed that there was no correlation among the top three dominant genera anaeromyxobacter lacunisphaera and sorangium with the dnra rate and total abundance network analysis showed that caldimicrobium and lacunisphaera were the key connectors in the riparian hotspot however rda and correlation analysis showed that neither rate nor abundance was related to the two key genera the key genus caldimicrobium is an extremely thermophilic strictly anaerobic facultatively chemolithoautotrophic bacterium it not only possesses the nrfa gene but can also grow chemolithoautotrophically with molecular hydrogen in the presence of thiosulfate or elemental sulfur subsequently forming h2s miroshnichenko et al 2009 generally under sulfate rich anoxic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria are metabolically active and versatile with the ability to perform dnra through secondary metabolism resulting in increased dnra rates kimura 2000 an and gardner 2002 furthermore sulfide the product of sulfate reduction enhances dnra by serving as a potential electron donor for dnra bacteria in the sediments and soils tiedje 1988 sayama et al 2005 lu et al 2013 deng et al 2015 similarly fe ii could favor the dnra process by chemoautotrophic metabolisms robertson et al 2016 li et al 2019 even under oxic conditions roberts et al 2014 however in this study both the rda and correlation analysis showed that neither the dnra rates nor the dnra abundance had a positive relationship with sediment sulfate concentrations or fe ii lacunisphaera which has a peptidoglycan cell wall is a novel species in the new genus lacunisphaera gen nov family opitutaceae subdivision verrucomicrobial recently isolated from a freshwater lake rast et al 2017 it is not yet clear if this microorganism has the dnra function numerous studies and our previous researches reported the activities of n cycling processes were not positively correlated with the abundances of the related microorganisms but affected by the environmental factors the rate of dnra varied with nutrient gradient dong et al 2009 lu et al 2015 soil c n ratio and sulfate concentration shan et al 2016 glucose and free sulfide lu et al 2013 or soil ph zhang et al 2015 aoa and aob in wetland sediments with nh4 concentration wang et al 2011 anammox with no2 zhu et al 2013 and moisture content wang et al 2019a and denitrifier nosz ii in lake sediment with tom zhao et al 2018 in this study although the rate and abundance of dnra in the riparian zone were significantly higher than those in open water sediments there is no significant difference in the dnra bacterial community between open water and riparian zone sediments hence the higher dnra rate in the riparian zone might be attributed to the combined effect of various influencing factors moreover the influence of geochemical parameters may be greater than that of microbial processes which is consistence with the statement that the environmental controls that govern the end product of bacterial nitrate respiration kraft et al 2014 in the field of wetland ecology this result also provides some insight into the currently applied human management practices versus the less anthropogenically influenced systems we know that both nh4 and no3 are important nitrogen sources for plant growth and that common wetland plants generally have a higher uptake capacity v max by approximately 16 and a higher affinity low k t for nh4 compared to no3 tylova munzarova et al 2005 fang et al 2007 on the other hand the positively charged nh4 is more beneficial for adsorbing negatively charged soil colloid particles therefore the leaching rate of no3 is several or even dozens of times higher than nh4 allowing the leaching process to occur from surface water to groundwater resulting in no3 pollution riley et al 2001 most importantly the higher no3 accumulation could trigger a massive release of n2o therefore enhancement of the dnra process is beneficial for the retention of ammonium fertilizer in the riparian zone as well as for the reduction of no3 flux into the groundwater and n2o emission in the present study the interface sediments in the riparian zone represent the hotspot of dnra this result provides valuable information for the management of riparian zones anthropogenic changes in the riparian water table are expected to increase with subsequent changes in the reduction from no3 to nh4 this could significantly impact the cumulative n budget at a given location thereby bridging global changes and local management practices 5 conclusion both global and temporal scale results confirmed that dnra was widespread in the various sediments and the higher abundance and rate of dnra were found in riparian zone sediments rather than open water sediment dnra rate and abundance were positively correlated with the environmental controls tom and c n ratios tc nh4 and tc no2 but not with the most dominant genera anaeromyxobacter lacunisphaera and sorangium high throughput sequencing and network analyses showed that there were similar diversity and community structure of dnra bacteria between riparian zone and open water sediments but different key connectors in the related networks of dnra genera with caldimicrobium and lacunisphaera in the riparian sediments but anaeromyxobacter and sorangium in the open water ones in the dnra hotspot the n cycling processes were higher than those in the open water sediments the rates of dnra no3 reduction and no2 oxidation were more than the rates of denitrification and anammox in all the no2 oxidation which produced substrate no3 for dnra and no3 reduction which produced energy for dnra promoted a higher dnra rate in the riparian sediments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18126,wastewater treatment plants are a significant pathway of microplastics mps to aquatic environments to develop suitable management options and reduce microplastic emissions in treated effluent and sludge we must first develop a reliable method to understand their transport and fate throughout the treatment process an improved methodology was applied to determine the size shape polymer type and partitioning behaviour of mps using a combination of oxidation treatment fluorescent staining and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir to detect small mps 20 μm in wastewater the mean number of mps 5 mm detected using this methodology was 11 80 1 10 mp l in raw sewage 5 23 0 25 mp l in degritted wastewater 7 91 0 44 mp l in waste activated sludge and 2 76 0 11 mp l in the final treated effluent an increase in mps following primary screening suggests that was is a sink for several stealth microplastics including glitter which is returned to the effluent during the treatment process the estimated mp removal efficiency for the studied wwtp is relatively poor compared with global data for secondary wwtps which is likely due to the release of partially treated effluent into the pacific ocean via a second discharge point the information generated through this study can be useful to firstly inform on site wastewater management practices and secondly reduce mp concentrations in final treated effluents discharged to the marine environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics wastewater sludge secondary treatment methodology glitter 1 introduction microplastics plastic particles 5 mm mps are an emerging threat and pose serious risks to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems thompson et al 2004 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered a significant pathway of mps to the environment despite the existence of advanced wastewater treatment facilities mahon et al 2017 mason et al 2016 raju et al 2018 increasingly studies are examining the behaviour and transport of mps throughout wwtps and suggest that conventional treatment facilities do not remove plastic materials completely from sewage leslie et al 2017 consequently microplastics are emitted in relatively high quantities to the environment on a daily basis via final treated effluents and sludge products ziajahromi et al 2017 global studies have demonstrated that current wastewater treatment systems can remove 95 of mps from raw wastewater michielssen et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 this is largely through the partitioning of mps from the liquid phase to the sludge which has implications for the reuse of final treatment products for example it was estimated that between 63 000 430 000 and 44 000 300 000 tons of mps may be released to farmlands each year through the application of biosolids in europe and north america respectively nizzetto et al 2016 for australian agroecosystems this figure was estimated to be between 2800 and 19 000 tonnes of mp particles per year ng et al 2018 currently however there is a lack of published data on the quantity of mps released into australian ecosystems furthermore the role of australian wwtps as a significant pathway of mps to aquatic environments has previously only been investigated for the sydney city region browne et al 2011 ziajahromi et al 2017 and data is lacking regarding the efficiency of wwtps in regional areas methods for studying the sampling detection transport fate and quantification of mps during wastewater treatment processes vary significantly among studies sun et al 2019 leading to uncertainties in the published data and the need for a standardized approach michielssen et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 particle characteristics including the size shape polymer type and origins of mps primary or secondary in wastewater are significant factors that must be carefully considered when developing practical management approaches the quantification of mps in organic rich environmental samples i e wastewater sludge is challenging and many studies have attempted to separate mps without causing damage to the particle potentially compromising particle count estimates in order to obtain the mass of mps in wastewater and sludge products the removal of organic matter and subsequent underestimation of plastic particles must be taken into account some studies have attempted to do this using small quantities of sewage sludge and extracted mp particles using various methods such as the application of bleach and density based solutions carr et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2016 however for larger sample volumes the high concentration and mass of organic matter obscure the identification and quantification of mp particles in wastewater carr et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2016 treatments with hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid hno3 can result in the degradation and melding of mp particles claessens et al 2013 cole et al 2014 alkaline solutions such as sodium hydroxide naoh are known to degrade polyester through the saponification of ester linkages at the particle surface dave et al 1987 for biological and sludge samples a 16 decrease in the weight of polycarbonate pc was observed following treatment with 10 potassium hydroxide yoshida et al 2016 dehaut et al 2016 hurley et al 2018 enzymes have been successfully applied to digest biogenic material in small sample volumes without compromising the integrity of plastic materials for example 500 μg ml of proteinase k was applied to 0 2 g d w marine plankton samples to determine mp incidence and ingestion rates in seawater while the treatment was 97 effective for removing biological material it would be vastly expensive to employ this technique for large sample volumes with high organic content such as wastewater cole et al 2014 an enzymatic oxidative protease lipase and cellulase procedure has also successfully been applied to extract mps from treated wastewater however digestion took more than 13 days to complete mintenig et al 2017 while often favourable oxidative treatments for the digestion of organic material have several pros and cons for example sludge samples incubated in 30 h2o2 at 70 c for 5 h were shown to affect lightweight plastics such as poly methyl methacrylate pmma 1 18 g cm3 although this could have been due to the lower continuous operating temperature cot of pmma compared with the other plastic polymers sujathan et al 2017 a sequential wet peroxide oxidation method 40 ml of 0 05 m feso4 and 80 ml 30 h2o2 known as fenton s reagent required up to six digestions 70 c for 30 min to remove most cellulosic and other organic material interferents from wastewater dyachenko et al 2017 the use of fenton s reagent however caused no significant changes to the surface area or surface chemistry of polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polyvinyl chloride pvc microplastics when incubated at room temperature tagg et al 2016 another study employed 30 h2o2 and heated wastewater samples at 60 c until complete evaporation was achieved to increase the efficiency of identification and avoid overestimating mps rose bengal solution 4 5 6 7 tetrachloro 20 40 50 70 tetraiodofluorescein was used to stain remaining organic material enabling the quantification of mps down to 25 μm liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 ziajahromi et al 2017 in summary current methods to extract small mps from complex sample matrices have several limitations extraction efficiencies could be improved by integrating different processing steps and analytical techniques without compromising particle characteristics for the quantification of mps in wastewater samples a simple effective inexpensive and reproducible analytical method would assist in comparing results among wastewater treatment plants improving the accuracy of estimation will help to understand the transport of mps throughout wastewater treatment plants assess the efficiency of treatment facilities in removing mps from wastewater provide a particle size distribution of mps in various stages of the wastewater treatment process assess the risk of mps in wastewater which would help to develop efficient and effective management approaches smaller microplastic particles are toxicologically relevant but inconsistently reported due to the associated methodological challenges sun et al 2019 this study aims to present an improved methodology to quantify the smaller mps in wastewater samples thereby facilitating the detection of new size categories of microplastics 2 material and methods 2 1 study site sampling was carried out at a secondary wwtp located in the hunter region new south wales australia the facility treats 48 ml ml of sewage per day serving a population of 190 000 people raw wastewater is pumped to the preliminary treatment facility where the influent undergoes coarse screening and grit removal the screen house uses a rotary drum screen with a mesh size of 1 5 mm to remove larger particles following this the screen residues are washed dewatered and bagged before being transported to landfill the wastewater then flows to the grit removal chambers where sand and finer suspended solids are settled from the water column via centrifugation wastewater is then pumped to the secondary treatment process for biological treatment aeration of the settling tanks allows aerobic bacteria to grow and further treat the wastewater by breaking down organic matter clarifiers are used to settle the biological solids from the water column which are recycled back through the system to maintain optimal digestion allowing clear effluents to pass through finally secondary effluents undergo uv treatment before being discharged to the marine environment via an ocean outfall located 1 5 km offshore 2 2 sampling methodology wastewater was collected over three consecutive days in february 2018 during periods of peak flow samples were collected in brand new 10 l plastic buckets mintenig et al 2017 from the existing sampling points raw wastewater s1 degritted wastewater s2 waste activated sludge s3 and uv treated final effluent s4 fig 1 plastic buckets were chosen as steel buckets are prone to rusting when long term storage is required and rust may clog the sieves compromising microscopical examination prior to use the buckets were rinsed several times with tap water then milli q water and the contents subject to filtration total sample volumes were 20 l for raw influent 1 10 l sample per day for 2 days and 60 l for the remaining wastewater samples 2 10 l samples per day for 3 days samples were transported in bulk to the university of newcastle and stored at 4 c until analysis table 1 it should be noted that no rainfall had occurred in the lead up to sample collection therefore stormwater overflow was not expected to have influenced the samples in any way liu et al 2019a sample processing was carried out under clean fume hoods in a physical containment pc2 all working areas were wiped down with 70 ethanol prior to starting experiments wastewater samples were filtered onto a series of stainless steel mesh sieves and thoroughly examined to identify any plastic particles internal laboratory blanks milli q water in glass bottles and damp filter papers were employed during filtration and microscopic examination 2 3 method validation a method validation experiment was initially performed to test the recovery of different plastic polymers from wastewater under a clean fume hood in pre rinsed glass jars triplicate 1l samples of influent was and effluent were spiked with 10 mp pellets each of pvc pp and low density pe ldpe ranging 2 4 mm in size and 1 g of commercial facial scrub the facial scrub hereafter referred to as a personal care product or pcp was previously extracted for microbeads using a modified version of a previous method hernandez et al 2017 to determine the number of mp particles per gram a subset of microbeads were placed on double sided carbon tape coated with a thin film of platinum and imaged using a zeiss sigma vp field emission scanning electron microscope sem operated at 20 kev in backscatter mode to determine the size shape and surface appearance the influent and effluent samples were digested using 40 ml of fenton s reagent 0 05 m feso4 7h2o and 30 h2o2 at 70 c for 30 min this temperature was chosen to ensure maximum digestion efficiency while being careful to not to exceed the cot of the model plastic types approximately double the volume of fenton s reagent was required to digest was samples due to the high organic matter content following digestion samples were filtered through a series of stainless steel sieves to determine particle recovery rates 2 mm 1 mm and 250 μm endecott smaller sized sieves were not required in the validation study as the minimum particle size was 387 μm determined by sem for microbeads from pcps rose bengal solution 0 2 mg ml was applied to each sieve and allowed to stain for five minutes at room temperature before being gently rinsed with milli q water similar particles or beads that were present in the background samples were first examined then deducted when calculating the recovery rate the recovery rates for pvc pp and ldpe pellets and pe microbeads were calculated using the following formula m i c r o p l a s t i c r e cov e r y r a t e n u m b e r o f m p p a r t i c l e s r e cov e r e d n u m b e r o f m p p a r t i c l e s s p i k e d i n w a s t e w a t e r s a m p l e s 100 to determine the recovery efficiency for smaller plastic particles in the micrometer size range it was necessary to substitute milli q water for wastewater to prevent background interference from small mps present in wastewater samples briefly the model ldpe pellets were ground to a fine powder using an electric blender and sieved through 1 mm 250 μm 63 μm metal sieves to obtain the lower size fraction particles that passed through the 63 μm sieve were collected and sorted under a stereomicroscope triplicate samples containing one hundred ldpe particles 63 μm were mixed with 1 l milli q water and incubated in 40 ml of fenton s reagent for 30 min as described above samples were vacuum filtered through 1 5 μm cellulose filter discs and stained with nile red 9 diethylamino 5h benzo α phenoxazine5 one 10 μg ml in acetone for 30 min filter papers were subsequently rinsed will a small amount of milli q water and examined under a stereomicroscope equipped with blue light 450 510 nm and orange filter 529 nm to observe for particle fluorescence particles were counted and the recovery efficiency of small mps in aqueous samples calculated as per the above equation fluorescent particles were imaged under a leica microscope 40x using a handheld device and later imported into imagej 1 51k software for physical characterization 2 4 extraction of microplastics from wastewater the extraction of wastewater mps was carried out according to the methods described above briefly each 10l sample was mixed with fenton s reagent and left to incubate at room temperature overnight influent s1 and degritted treated wastewater s2 were treated with 360 ml of fenton s reagent while was s3 required 720 ml of digestive agent following incubation the samples were filtered through decreasing sized sieves 2 mm 1 mm 500 μm 250 μm 125 μm 53 μm 38 μm to separate mps into distinct size classes and stained with rose bengal to differentiate biological materials the remaining filtrate 38 μm was passed through 1 5 μm cellulose filters for was samples density based separation using sodium iodide solution nai 1 8 g cm3 was performed to increase the separation of finer particles from the filtrate the was filtrate containing nai was first centrifuged at 3500 rpm passed through 1 5 μm cellulose filter discs and examined as above the particles were retrieved from sieves and filter papers using a fine needle and stored in milli q water until the characterisation phase 2 5 characterization of microplastics

particles were rinsed with milli q water to remove any residual residue and a representative portion 10 was taken for polymer type determination via attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy perkinelmer spectra were obtained in transmission mode between the 4000 400 cm 1 wavenumber range with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and an average of 4 16 scans spectra were identified using bruker spectrum software libraries and compared with published data jung et al 2018 to determine the synthetic nature and corresponding polymer type microplastic concentrations were then calculated for influent degritted wastewater was and uv treated wastewater and expressed as mean standard error per litre 3 results 3 1 method validation the microbeads present in facial scrub were confirmed as pe using atr ftir each 1g aliquot of gel contained 27 30 microbeads which ranged in size from 387 to 672 μm confirmed via sem fig s9 in supplementary the recovery rate of the pvc pp and ldpe pellets and the pe microbeads was considered 100 as all pellets and microbeads were retrieved intact without any evidence of damage or fragmentation for the smaller particles 63 μm recovery from milli q water was determined to be 93 6 fig s7 no particles were observed in the negative controls from the fume hood spaces buckets wet filter papers or sample blanks 3 2 microplastics in wastewater samples the methodology used in this study was successful in identifying small mps present in concentrated wastewater samples which may have been overlooked by previous studies the negative controls revealed no particles or fiber contamination in the laboratory working area the organic content was successfully digested without any noticeable changes to the microplastics and suspected particles including glass particles were avoided using a rose bengal staining technique for each wastewater sample mps were classified into size shape and polymer type using powered microscopy and atr ftir influent s1 the different sized filters i e 1 mm 250 μm 125 μm 38 μm and 1 5 μm captured 8 05 9 75 19 49 22 88 39 83 of the total load of mp particles in influent respectively plastic fragments 38 56 and fibers 35 59 were the predominant mp shape in influent samples characterization via atr ftir revealed that the fragments consisted of polypropylene pp 35 91 while the microfibers were mainly polyesters pest 24 64 and polyamide pa 9 5 figs 2 and 3 4 degritted wastewater s2 the size distribution of mps in degritted wastewater was similar to that for influent 1 mm 11 15 250 μm 5 41 125 μm 22

present in effluent samples were reduced compared with influent and it was further observed that the foams present in the influent samples were absent in the effluent samples while mps were still observed across all sieve sizes the particles tended to be long fibers made up of pest 45 94 pp 24 32 pa 11 48 pe 9 45 pmma 3 37 polybutylene terephthalate pbt 2 70 and rayon 2 70 figs 2 4 representative spectra can be found in the supplementary fig s13 overall an average of 11 8 1 10 mp l were detected in raw wastewater s1 5 23 0 25 mp l in degritted wastewater s2 7 91 0 44 mp l in waste activated sludge s3 and 2 7 0 11 mp l in the final effluent s4 of a regional secondary wwtp this indicated the removal of 76 61 of mps from the raw influent which is similar to what previous studies have documented liu et al 2019b mason et al 2016 table 2 an increase in the mean number of mp particles present in s3 samples however indicated that legacy mps contained in the sludge were returned to the effluent via was owing to the unique design of the surveyed wwtp mp emissions to the pacific ocean were therefore estimated for the two discharge points s3 s4 the mp removal efficiency was then calculated for each individual treatment stage in order to assist with the development of effective management options to reduce mp concentrations in treated wastewater tables s1 and 2 4 discussion detailed assessments of wwtp processes and technologies with a focus on efficiency in removing mps is required to assist in the development of technological innovation to further reduce mp loads delivered to the natural environment michielssen et al 2016 the amount of mps in raw wastewater depends on a number of factors including the population serviced by the plant the level of urbanization and industrial activity in the wastewater catchment area the design and operation of the treatment facilities are significant factors in determining the number of mps discharged in the final treated effluents hartline et al 2016 while these factors are unique to each treatment plant inherent differences lie in the methodologies employed to collect and process samples making comparisons among treatment plants difficult based on previous studies we made several methodological improvements to understand the transport and fate of mp during the wastewater treatment process firstly samples were collected from the same sampling point over three consecutive days to account for daily variability in mp loads murphy et al 2016 secondly a combination of increased sample volumes 20 60 l and multiple sized filtration sieves were used to determine the size distribution of mps in wastewater to aid with risk assessment finally by applying an oxidative agent on an as needed basis according to the solids and organic content we were able to improve the efficiency of detection for smaller mps while being cautious not to affect the surface area or chemistry of the particles smaller mps are challenging to detect in environmental samples as the ambiguous characteristics of non plastics resembling plastics and plastics resembling non plastics affects the accuracy of the initial visual identification previous studies have demonstrated that biological contaminants may also inhibit the analysis of ftir spectra carr et al 2016 however the use of an oxidative agent to remove adsorbed biological material helped to resolve this issue li et al 2018 for density separation sodium iodide was used to increase the extraction of denser plastics such as pvc pet and pa quinn et al 2017 nile red was used to take advantage of the lipophilicity of polymers maes et al 2017 thereby improving the efficiency of identification suspected plastic particles were then confirmed as being synthetic in nature via atr ftir and any unidentified spectra were moved to the category labelled other to prevent overestimation of wastewater mps during the treatment process the density of plastic particles is the main factor determining the rising or sinking velocity in the environmental matrix ballent et al 2013 generally mps have a greater density than wastewater and are removed via physical sedimentation in the primary treatment stage in contrast lower density mps may float on the surface of wastewater and be removed by skimming and settling processes carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017a in our study pet 1 38 g cm³ 24 and abs 1 05 g cm³ 8 21 were present in greater amounts in sludge compared to other low density pe and pp particles ranging from 0 90 to 0 94 g cm³ this suggests that mps partition on the basis of polymer density during physical sedimentation previously bio coatings have been shown to modify the surface properties of hydrophobic pe fragments suggesting that biofilms hay have the potential to increase the relative densities of plastic particles carr et al 2016 recently liu et al 2019b reported that compared with pp and pe the proportion of pa was higher in sludge than in wastewater similarly in our study fibers made up of pest 7 79 and pa 19 63 were abundant in the sludge phase the amount of microfibers in wastewater warrants further attention as they may firstly serve as available habitat for microbes and secondly increase the degree of biofouling leading to sedimentation and accumulation in sludge rounded and irregular shaped foams were also present in a greater abundance in was 6 95 compared with influent 2 97 and treated effluent none fig s2 due to the porous nature of foams e g expanded polystyrene it is possible that solids and organic inorganic matter adsorbed to the particle surface increasing the specific density of the polymer similarly the overall abundance of pet 1 3 g cm3 was greater in was 24 than in the effluent 2 41 during activated sludge treatment the microbial enzymes in combination with dissolved oxygen assist the growth of biological flocs that concentrate mps in the sludge murphy et al 2016 peng et al 2017 consequently particles captured in the final effluent were mostly longer entangled fibers with a small diameter 57 83 while other shapes were reduced our study suggests that mp fragments foams and glitter are largely removed from wastewater via partitioning to the sludge michielssen et al 2016 while fibers remain suspended in the effluent this was potentially due to the size of the detected fibers which had a diameter of 11 9 17 7 μm enabling them to pass through sieves and filter longitudinally previously fibers were shown to pass through a membrane with a pore size of 0 08 μm when high pressure was applied leslie et al 2017 this is substantial evidence supporting the movement of microfibers through even the lowest membrane technology murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a ftir characterization revealed that the fibers consisted mainly of rayon acrylic polyester polyamide and polypropylene which are associated with synthetic fabrics synthetic textiles are produced with the aid of harmful chemicals which may cause serious ecological and human health problems mishra et al 2019 possible sources of fibers to wastewater include the laundering of synthetic fabrics and shedding of textiles during the ageing process clothing linen carpets etc a 6 kg load of laundry was estimated to release 138 000 728 000 fibers per load depending on the type of synthetic textiles being laundered napper and thompson 2016 airborne contamination of open water bodies must also be considered when assessing mp loads in wwtps talvitie et al 2017a previously in paris atmospheric microplastics were shown to deposit onto a rooftop at a rate of 29 280 particles m2 day mean 118 particles m2 day dris et al 2015 working off a 98 4 removal rate for secondary treatment plants murphy et al 2016 hartline et al 2016 estimated that 0 64 3 85 kg of microfibers are retained in wwtp sludge each day with 0 01 0 06 kg being released into the aquatic environment based on our results we calculated that was samples contained 3 5 3 9 106 microfibers while uv treated effluent released 6 2 6 7 107 to the marine environment per day this is the first published study to demonstrate the fate of glitter during wastewater treatment processes by highlighting its abundance in was glitter particles are small enough to bypass the drum screen 1 5 mm during the primary treatment stage partitioning mainly to the sludge 24 due to the specific density of pbt c12h12o4 n and pet c10h8o4 density 1 31 1 38 g cm3 similarly a report in norway found that glitter accounted for 1 7 mps in sludge samples ranging from 261 to 509 μm in size with the majority being green pink yellow and clear in colour lusher et al 2018 our methodology detected black green yellow pink and red glitter ranging between 99 71 968 μm in size possible sources of glitter to wastewater are cosmetics fabrics and decorations from celebrations events in order to bring about the desired sparkling effect glitter usually consists of plastic particles coated in a fine layer of metallic or mineral compounds glitter may therefore be an additional contaminant in itself or serve as a vector for wastewater contaminants to the aquatic environment the estimated daily discharge of glitter particles was between 2 7 3 0 107 in was and 2 5 2 7 106 particles in effluent based on the average volume of wastewater treated by this plant so far this overlooked pollutant has not been addressed in detail however its size and shape aligns it with the classification of a primary mp tagg and ivar do sul 2019 fruit stickers have also not been addressed as an environmental plastic or pollutant yet they appear as litter throughout parks and public places our water utility industry partners acknowledged that fruit stickers are often encountered in the wastewater sludge personal communication despite being 2 cm 1 6 cm in size when elongated the identified fruit sticker made of thermoplastic polyurethane pu was observed in a was sample of the 2 mm sieve in a rolled up and compressed state this indicates that some larger objects such as fruit stickers are able to bypass the 1 5 mm drum screens during the de gritting phase fruit stickers present a potentially concerning newly identified mp as the chemicals used for adhesive purposes e g turpentine urea formaldehyde resins synthetic paraffin and petroleum may have detrimental biological effects over periods of long term exposure code of federal regulations title 21 food and drug administration 2012 possible sources of fruit stickers could be household drains and improper waste management practices the lack of colour change intact shape and remnants of adhesive on the underside of the sticker confirmed that current secondary treatment processes may not be capable of degrading this class of pollutant the text on the label fig s5 indicated that this was one among five popular varieties used on fruit and vegetables being sold in the region it is estimated that the 300 000 tonnes of apples alone are produced each year in australia which may be consumed with the skin on removed similarly other common fruits including avocados oranges mandarins and stone fruits are labelled with stickers that may be accidentally ingested or disposed of in various waste streams the hazardous effects of stickers resulting from their size chemical ingredients and potential for contaminant transport to marine life and humans have not yet been addressed the other commonly detected particles were abs pmma and pu abs thermoplastic provides high tensile strength is resistant to physical impacts and chemical corrosion pu particles derive from furniture adhesives such as construction glue products surface coating and sealing applications pmma is commonly used as a glass substitute in aircraft windows intraocular lenses and roofing compounds and in 3d printers for injection moulding the methyl acrylate monomer is known to cause thermal chemical damage despite its use in cranioplasty pikis et al 2015 while the chemical constituents of pmma including butadiene and styrene are possible human carcinogens in all the treatment stages the quantify of smaller particles was greater in the 125 μm 1 5 μm size range compared with the larger size classes this finding is crucial due to the fact smaller size particles will provide a greater specific area for adsorption of hazardous chemicals and microbial growth hoellein et al 2014 moore 2008 mps are insoluble in water non degradable and possess different physicochemical properties and these dominant factors determine their bioavailability to organisms carbery et al 2018 rocha santos and duarte 2015 secondary mps were present in greater quantities than primary mps in each treatment stage previously in effluents from australian wastewater treatment facilities it was reported that pet fibers and pe particles were the most abundant microplastic types browne et al 2011 ziajahromi et al 2017 interestingly in one study microbeads from pcps were not detected in any of the treated effluent samples yang et al 2019 this highlights that differences in the wastewater catchment and individual treatment facilities may significantly impact the emission of mps from wwtps previous studies have reported a mp removal efficiency ranging from 64 to 99 56 for secondary treatment facilities gies et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b here we report a reduction in overall mp loads of 76 61 for effluent and 32 96 for was several limitations were observed in our methodology such as the high cost of chemicals the discolouring of cellulose filter discs by various solutions and the sensitivity of nai to increased temperatures we are therefore still exploring and developing superior methods the nile red co staining effect on partially digested biological matter can also interfere with visual identification via atr ftir or raman spectroscopy due to particle fluorescence shim et al 2016 polymer identification is considered one of the disadvantages of nile red particularly for black particles such as polyester which exhibited poor fluorescence stanton et al 2019 this is because raman spectra can be affected by coloured matter additives and other pollutants that are potentially attached to mps lenz et al 2015 removal of absorbed nile red de staining or improved spectroscopy facilities would certainly improve the chemical characterization of polymers additionally due to the small diameters microfibers can burn under raman and ftir furthermore some mps particularly those extracted form wastewater and environmental samples may have other impurities that inhibit the ability to obtain a clear spectrum as a result this may hinder the identification process and lead to a high chance of false estimation using raman or ftir for wastewater samples zhu et al 2019 5 conclusion this first study on mps in a regional australian wwtp indicates that mps were present throughout all stages of the treatment process and are released to the pacific ocean in high quantities via was and final treated effluent on a daily basis furthermore high concentrations of glitter were detected in wastewater sludge suggesting that glitter constitutes a major source of primary microplastics that require further remedial attention this information can be used to inform the relevant water management authority and potentially help to develop better onsite management practices to reduce mp concentrations in final discharged effluents with reference to the quantification and characterization of these plastic particles the impacts on wastewater treatment processes and plastic particles themselves represent an area that requires much more scientific attention our ongoing research focuses on the transport potential chemical and biological wastewater contaminants on marine life and mechanisms to reduce mp concentrations in final

18126,wastewater treatment plants are a significant pathway of microplastics mps to aquatic environments to develop suitable management options and reduce microplastic emissions in treated effluent and sludge we must first develop a reliable method to understand their transport and fate throughout the treatment process an improved methodology was applied to determine the size shape polymer type and partitioning behaviour of mps using a combination of oxidation treatment fluorescent staining and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir to detect small mps 20 μm in wastewater the mean number of mps 5 mm detected using this methodology was 11 80 1 10 mp l in raw sewage 5 23 0 25 mp l in degritted wastewater 7 91 0 44 mp l in waste activated sludge and 2 76 0 11 mp l in the final treated effluent an increase in mps following primary screening suggests that was is a sink for several stealth microplastics including glitter which is returned to the effluent during the treatment process the estimated mp removal efficiency for the studied wwtp is relatively poor compared with global data for secondary wwtps which is likely due to the release of partially treated effluent into the pacific ocean via a second discharge point the information generated through this study can be useful to firstly inform on site wastewater management practices and secondly reduce mp concentrations in final treated effluents discharged to the marine environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics wastewater sludge secondary treatment methodology glitter 1 introduction microplastics plastic particles 5 mm mps are an emerging threat and pose serious risks to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems thompson et al 2004 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered a significant pathway of mps to the environment despite the existence of advanced wastewater treatment facilities mahon et al 2017 mason et al 2016 raju et al 2018 increasingly studies are examining the behaviour and transport of mps throughout wwtps and suggest that conventional treatment facilities do not remove plastic materials completely from sewage leslie et al 2017 consequently microplastics are emitted in relatively high quantities to the environment on a daily basis via final treated effluents and sludge products ziajahromi et al 2017 global studies have demonstrated that current wastewater treatment systems can remove 95 of mps from raw wastewater michielssen et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 this is largely through the partitioning of mps from the liquid phase to the sludge which has implications for the reuse of final treatment products for example it was estimated that between 63 000 430 000 and 44 000 300 000 tons of mps may be released to farmlands each year through the application of biosolids in europe and north america respectively nizzetto et al 2016 for australian agroecosystems this figure was estimated to be between 2800 and 19 000 tonnes of mp particles per year ng et al 2018 currently however there is a lack of published data on the quantity of mps released into australian ecosystems furthermore the role of australian wwtps as a significant pathway of mps to aquatic environments has previously only been investigated for the sydney city region browne et al 2011 ziajahromi et al 2017 and data is lacking regarding the efficiency of wwtps in regional areas methods for studying the sampling detection transport fate and quantification of mps during wastewater treatment processes vary significantly among studies sun et al 2019 leading to uncertainties in the published data and the need for a standardized approach michielssen et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 particle characteristics including the size shape polymer type and origins of mps primary or secondary in wastewater are significant factors that must be carefully considered when developing practical management approaches the quantification of mps in organic rich environmental samples i e wastewater sludge is challenging and many studies have attempted to separate mps without causing damage to the particle potentially compromising particle count estimates in order to obtain the mass of mps in wastewater and sludge products the removal of organic matter and subsequent underestimation of plastic particles must be taken into account some studies have attempted to do this using small quantities of sewage sludge and extracted mp particles using various methods such as the application of bleach and density based solutions carr et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2016 however for larger sample volumes the high concentration and mass of organic matter obscure the identification and quantification of mp particles in wastewater carr et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2016 treatments with hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid hno3 can result in the degradation and melding of mp particles claessens et al 2013 cole et al 2014 alkaline solutions such as sodium hydroxide naoh are known to degrade polyester through the saponification of ester linkages at the particle surface dave et al 1987 for biological and sludge samples a 16 decrease in the weight of polycarbonate pc was observed following treatment with 10 potassium hydroxide yoshida et al 2016 dehaut et al 2016 hurley et al 2018 enzymes have been successfully applied to digest biogenic material in small sample volumes without compromising the integrity of plastic materials for example 500 μg ml of proteinase k was applied to 0 2 g d w marine plankton samples to determine mp incidence and ingestion rates in seawater while the treatment was 97 effective for removing biological material it would be vastly expensive to employ this technique for large sample volumes with high organic content such as wastewater cole et al 2014 an enzymatic oxidative protease lipase and cellulase procedure has also successfully been applied to extract mps from treated wastewater however digestion took more than 13 days to complete mintenig et al 2017 while often favourable oxidative treatments for the digestion of organic material have several pros and cons for example sludge samples incubated in 30 h2o2 at 70 c for 5 h were shown to affect lightweight plastics such as poly methyl methacrylate pmma 1 18 g cm3 although this could have been due to the lower continuous operating temperature cot of pmma compared with the other plastic polymers sujathan et al 2017 a sequential wet peroxide oxidation method 40 ml of 0 05 m feso4 and 80 ml 30 h2o2 known as fenton s reagent required up to six digestions 70 c for 30 min to remove most cellulosic and other organic material interferents from wastewater dyachenko et al 2017 the use of fenton s reagent however caused no significant changes to the surface area or surface chemistry of polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polyvinyl chloride pvc microplastics when incubated at room temperature tagg et al 2016 another study employed 30 h2o2 and heated wastewater samples at 60 c until complete evaporation was achieved to increase the efficiency of identification and avoid overestimating mps rose bengal solution 4 5 6 7 tetrachloro 20 40 50 70 tetraiodofluorescein was used to stain remaining organic material enabling the quantification of mps down to 25 μm liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 ziajahromi et al 2017 in summary current methods to extract small mps from complex sample matrices have several limitations extraction efficiencies could be improved by integrating different processing steps and analytical techniques without compromising particle characteristics for the quantification of mps in wastewater samples a simple effective inexpensive and reproducible analytical method would assist in comparing results among wastewater treatment plants improving the accuracy of estimation will help to understand the transport of mps throughout wastewater treatment plants assess the efficiency of treatment facilities in removing mps from wastewater provide a particle size distribution of mps in various stages of the wastewater treatment process assess the risk of mps in wastewater which would help to develop efficient and effective management approaches smaller microplastic particles are toxicologically relevant but inconsistently reported due to the associated methodological challenges sun et al 2019 this study aims to present an improved methodology to quantify the smaller mps in wastewater samples thereby facilitating the detection of new size categories of microplastics 2 material and methods 2 1 study site sampling was carried out at a secondary wwtp located in the hunter region new south wales australia the facility treats 48 ml ml of sewage per day serving a population of 190 000 people raw wastewater is pumped to the preliminary treatment facility where the influent undergoes coarse screening and grit removal the screen house uses a rotary drum screen with a mesh size of 1 5 mm to remove larger particles following this the screen residues are washed dewatered and bagged before being transported to landfill the wastewater then flows to the grit removal chambers where sand and finer suspended solids are settled from the water column via centrifugation wastewater is then pumped to the secondary treatment process for biological treatment aeration of the settling tanks allows aerobic bacteria to grow and further treat the wastewater by breaking down organic matter clarifiers are used to settle the biological solids from the water column which are recycled back through the system to maintain optimal digestion allowing clear effluents to pass through finally secondary effluents undergo uv treatment before being discharged to the marine environment via an ocean outfall located 1 5 km offshore 2 2 sampling methodology wastewater was collected over three consecutive days in february 2018 during periods of peak flow samples were collected in brand new 10 l plastic buckets mintenig et al 2017 from the existing sampling points raw wastewater s1 degritted wastewater s2 waste activated sludge s3 and uv treated final effluent s4 fig 1 plastic buckets were chosen as steel buckets are prone to rusting when long term storage is required and rust may clog the sieves compromising microscopical examination prior to use the buckets were rinsed several times with tap water then milli q water and the contents subject to filtration total sample volumes were 20 l for raw influent 1 10 l sample per day for 2 days and 60 l for the remaining wastewater samples 2 10 l samples per day for 3 days samples were transported in bulk to the university of newcastle and stored at 4 c until analysis table 1 it should be noted that no rainfall had occurred in the lead up to sample collection therefore stormwater overflow was not expected to have influenced the samples in any way liu et al 2019a sample processing was carried out under clean fume hoods in a physical containment pc2 all working areas were wiped down with 70 ethanol prior to starting experiments wastewater samples were filtered onto a series of stainless steel mesh sieves and thoroughly examined to identify any plastic particles internal laboratory blanks milli q water in glass bottles and damp filter papers were employed during filtration and microscopic examination 2 3 method validation a method validation experiment was initially performed to test the recovery of different plastic polymers from wastewater under a clean fume hood in pre rinsed glass jars triplicate 1l samples of influent was and effluent were spiked with 10 mp pellets each of pvc pp and low density pe ldpe ranging 2 4 mm in size and 1 g of commercial facial scrub the facial scrub hereafter referred to as a personal care product or pcp was previously extracted for microbeads using a modified version of a previous method hernandez et al 2017 to determine the number of mp particles per gram a subset of microbeads were placed on double sided carbon tape coated with a thin film of platinum and imaged using a zeiss sigma vp field emission scanning electron microscope sem operated at 20 kev in backscatter mode to determine the size shape and surface appearance the influent and effluent samples were digested using 40 ml of fenton s reagent 0 05 m feso4 7h2o and 30 h2o2 at 70 c for 30 min this temperature was chosen to ensure maximum digestion efficiency while being careful to not to exceed the cot of the model plastic types approximately double the volume of fenton s reagent was required to digest was samples due to the high organic matter content following digestion samples were filtered through a series of stainless steel sieves to determine particle recovery rates 2 mm 1 mm and 250 μm endecott smaller sized sieves were not required in the validation study as the minimum particle size was 387 μm determined by sem for microbeads from pcps rose bengal solution 0 2 mg ml was applied to each sieve and allowed to stain for five minutes at room temperature before being gently rinsed with milli q water similar particles or beads that were present in the background samples were first examined then deducted when calculating the recovery rate the recovery rates for pvc pp and ldpe pellets and pe microbeads were calculated using the following formula m i c r o p l a s t i c r e cov e r y r a t e n u m b e r o f m p p a r t i c l e s r e cov e r e d n u m b e r o f m p p a r t i c l e s s p i k e d i n w a s t e w a t e r s a m p l e s 100 to determine the recovery efficiency for smaller plastic particles in the micrometer size range it was necessary to substitute milli q water for wastewater to prevent background interference from small mps present in wastewater samples briefly the model ldpe pellets were ground to a fine powder using an electric blender and sieved through 1 mm 250 μm 63 μm metal sieves to obtain the lower size fraction particles that passed through the 63 μm sieve were collected and sorted under a stereomicroscope triplicate samples containing one hundred ldpe particles 63 μm were mixed with 1 l milli q water and incubated in 40 ml of fenton s reagent for 30 min as described above samples were vacuum filtered through 1 5 μm cellulose filter discs and stained with nile red 9 diethylamino 5h benzo α phenoxazine5 one 10 μg ml in acetone for 30 min filter papers were subsequently rinsed will a small amount of milli q water and examined under a stereomicroscope equipped with blue light 450 510 nm and orange filter 529 nm to observe for particle fluorescence particles were counted and the recovery efficiency of small mps in aqueous samples calculated as per the above equation fluorescent particles were imaged under a leica microscope 40x using a handheld device and later imported into imagej 1 51k software for physical characterization 2 4 extraction of microplastics from wastewater the extraction of wastewater mps was carried out according to the methods described above briefly each 10l sample was mixed with fenton s reagent and left to incubate at room temperature overnight influent s1 and degritted treated wastewater s2 were treated with 360 ml of fenton s reagent while was s3 required 720 ml of digestive agent following incubation the samples were filtered through decreasing sized sieves 2 mm 1 mm 500 μm 250 μm 125 μm 53 μm 38 μm to separate mps into distinct size classes and stained with rose bengal to differentiate biological materials the remaining filtrate 38 μm was passed through 1 5 μm cellulose filters for was samples density based separation using sodium iodide solution nai 1 8 g cm3 was performed to increase the separation of finer particles from the filtrate the was filtrate containing nai was first centrifuged at 3500 rpm passed through 1 5 μm cellulose filter discs and examined as above the particles were retrieved from sieves and filter papers using a fine needle and stored in milli q water until the characterisation phase 2 5 characterization of microplastics microplastics were categorized by size class 1 mm 250 μm 125 μm 38 μm 1 5 μm and shape fibers lines fragments films foams beads and glitter supplementary fig s1 s6 s8 following visual examination particles were rinsed with milli q water to remove any residual residue and a representative portion 10 was taken for polymer type determination via attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy perkinelmer spectra were obtained in transmission mode between the 4000 400 cm 1 wavenumber range with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and an average of 4 16 scans spectra were identified using bruker spectrum software libraries and compared with published data jung et al 2018 to determine the synthetic nature and corresponding polymer type microplastic concentrations were then calculated for influent degritted wastewater was and uv treated wastewater and expressed as mean standard error per litre 3 results 3 1 method validation the microbeads present in facial scrub were confirmed as pe using atr ftir each 1g aliquot of gel contained 27 30 microbeads which ranged in size from 387 to 672 μm confirmed via sem fig s9 in supplementary the recovery rate of the pvc pp and ldpe pellets and the pe microbeads was considered 100 as all pellets and microbeads were retrieved intact without any evidence of damage or fragmentation for the smaller particles 63 μm recovery from milli q water was determined to be 93 6 fig s7 no particles were observed in the negative controls from the fume hood spaces buckets wet filter papers or sample blanks 3 2 microplastics in wastewater samples the methodology used in this study was successful in identifying small mps present in concentrated wastewater samples which may have been overlooked by previous studies the negative controls revealed no particles or fiber contamination in the laboratory working area the organic content was successfully digested without any noticeable changes to the microplastics and suspected particles including glass particles were avoided using a rose bengal staining technique for each wastewater sample mps were classified into size shape and polymer type using powered microscopy and atr ftir influent s1 the different sized filters i e 1 mm 250 μm 125 μm 38 μm and 1 5 μm captured 8 05 9 75 19 49 22 88 39 83 of the total load of mp particles in influent respectively plastic fragments 38 56 and fibers 35 59 were the predominant mp shape in influent samples characterization via atr ftir revealed that the fragments consisted of polypropylene pp 35 91 while the microfibers were mainly polyesters pest 24 64 and polyamide pa 9 5 figs 2 and 3 4 degritted wastewater s2 the size distribution of mps in degritted wastewater was similar to that for influent 1 mm 11 15 250 μm 5 41 125 μm 22 61 38 μm 36 31 and 1 5 μm 24 52 the dominant mp shapes in degritted wastewater were microfibers 36 31 fragments 30 57 and beads derived from personal care products 3 18 most microfibers were pest 26

distribution of mps in was was as follows 1 mm 9 04 250 μm 12 65 125 μm 39 76 38 μm 21 08 and 1 5 μm 9 68 after fibers 30 5 fragments 24 42 and glitter 24 were also highly abundant followed by foams 8 21 beads 4 21 and films 6 95 a total of 15 different polymer types were detected in was and characterized using atr ftir these included acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs 9 01 acrylonitrile styrene acrylate asa 0 23 ldpe 2 31 pa 19 63 pe 5 31 pest 8 08 pet 26 33 pmma 4 39 and pp 7 39 figs 2 3 4 effluent s4 in final treated effluent particles were distributed across the sieves as follows 1 mm 9

present in effluent samples were reduced compared with influent and it was further observed that the foams present in the influent samples were absent in the effluent samples while mps were still observed across all sieve sizes the particles tended to be long fibers made up of pest 45 94 pp 24 32 pa 11 48 pe 9 45 pmma 3 37 polybutylene terephthalate pbt 2 70 and rayon 2 70 figs 2 4 representative spectra can be found in the supplementary fig s13 overall an average of 11 8 1 10 mp l were detected in raw wastewater s1 5 23 0 25 mp l in degritted wastewater s2 7 91 0 44 mp l in waste activated sludge s3 and 2 7 0 11 mp l in the final effluent s4 of a regional secondary wwtp this indicated the removal of 76 61 of mps from the raw influent which is similar to what previous studies have documented liu et al 2019b mason et al 2016 table 2 an increase in the mean number of mp particles present in s3 samples however indicated that legacy mps contained in the sludge were returned to the effluent via was owing to the unique design of the surveyed wwtp mp emissions to the pacific ocean were therefore estimated for the two discharge points s3 s4 the mp removal efficiency was then calculated for each individual treatment stage in order to assist with the development of effective management options to reduce mp concentrations in treated wastewater tables s1 and 2 4 discussion detailed assessments of wwtp processes and technologies with a focus on efficiency in removing mps is required to assist in the development of technological innovation to further reduce mp loads delivered to the natural environment michielssen et al 2016 the amount of mps in raw wastewater depends on a number of factors including the population serviced by the plant the level of urbanization and industrial activity in the wastewater catchment area the design and operation of the treatment facilities are significant factors in determining the number of mps discharged in the final treated effluents hartline et al 2016 while these factors are unique to each treatment plant inherent differences lie in the methodologies employed to collect and process samples making comparisons among treatment plants difficult based on previous studies we made several methodological improvements to understand the transport and fate of mp during the wastewater treatment process firstly samples were collected from the same sampling point over three consecutive days to account for daily variability in mp loads murphy et al 2016 secondly a combination of increased sample volumes 20 60 l and multiple sized filtration sieves were used to determine the size distribution of mps in wastewater to aid with risk assessment finally by applying an oxidative agent on an as needed basis according to the solids and organic content we were able to improve the efficiency of detection for smaller mps while being cautious not to affect the surface area or chemistry of the particles smaller mps are challenging to detect in environmental samples as the ambiguous characteristics of non plastics resembling plastics and plastics resembling non plastics affects the accuracy of the initial visual identification previous studies have demonstrated that biological contaminants may also inhibit the analysis of ftir spectra carr et al 2016 however the use of an oxidative agent to remove adsorbed biological material helped to resolve this issue li et al 2018 for density separation sodium iodide was used to increase the extraction of denser plastics such as pvc pet and pa quinn et al 2017 nile red was used to take advantage of the lipophilicity of polymers maes et al 2017 thereby improving the efficiency of identification suspected plastic particles were then confirmed as being synthetic in nature via atr ftir and any unidentified spectra were moved to the category labelled other to prevent overestimation of wastewater mps during the treatment process the density of plastic particles is the main factor determining the rising or sinking velocity in the environmental matrix ballent et al 2013 generally mps have a greater density than wastewater and are removed via physical sedimentation in the primary treatment stage in contrast lower density mps may float on the surface of wastewater and be removed by skimming and settling processes carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017a in our study pet 1 38 g cm³ 24 and abs 1 05 g cm³ 8 21 were present in greater amounts in sludge compared to other low density pe and pp particles ranging from 0 90 to 0 94 g cm³ this suggests that mps partition on the basis of polymer density during physical sedimentation previously bio coatings have been shown to modify the surface properties of hydrophobic pe fragments suggesting that biofilms hay have the potential to increase the relative densities of plastic particles carr et al 2016 recently liu et al 2019b reported that compared with pp and pe the proportion of pa was higher in sludge than in wastewater similarly in our study fibers made up of pest 7 79 and pa 19 63 were abundant in the sludge phase the amount of microfibers in wastewater warrants further attention as they may firstly serve as available habitat for microbes and secondly increase the degree of biofouling leading to sedimentation and accumulation in sludge rounded and irregular shaped foams were also present in a greater abundance in was 6 95 compared with influent 2 97 and treated effluent none fig s2 due to the porous nature of foams e g expanded polystyrene it is possible that solids and organic inorganic matter adsorbed to the particle surface increasing the specific density of the polymer similarly the overall abundance of pet 1 3 g cm3 was greater in was 24 than in the effluent 2 41 during activated sludge treatment the microbial enzymes in combination with dissolved oxygen assist the growth of biological flocs that concentrate mps in the sludge murphy et al 2016 peng et al 2017 consequently particles captured in the final effluent were mostly longer entangled fibers with a small diameter 57 83 while other shapes were reduced our study suggests that mp fragments foams and glitter are largely removed from wastewater via partitioning to the sludge michielssen et al 2016 while fibers remain suspended in the effluent this was potentially due to the size of the detected fibers which had a diameter of 11 9 17 7 μm enabling them to pass through sieves and filter longitudinally previously fibers were shown to pass through a membrane with a pore size of 0 08 μm when high pressure was applied leslie et al 2017 this is substantial evidence supporting the movement of microfibers through even the lowest membrane technology murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a ftir characterization revealed that the fibers consisted mainly of rayon acrylic polyester polyamide and polypropylene which are associated with synthetic fabrics synthetic textiles are produced with the aid of harmful chemicals which may cause serious ecological and human health problems mishra et al 2019 possible sources of fibers to wastewater include the laundering of synthetic fabrics and shedding of textiles during the ageing process clothing linen carpets etc a 6 kg load of laundry was estimated to release 138 000 728 000 fibers per load depending on the type of synthetic textiles being laundered napper and thompson 2016 airborne contamination of open water bodies must also be considered when assessing mp loads in wwtps talvitie et al 2017a previously in paris atmospheric microplastics were shown to deposit onto a rooftop at a rate of 29 280 particles m2 day mean 118 particles m2 day dris et al 2015 working off a 98 4 removal rate for secondary treatment plants murphy et al 2016 hartline et al 2016 estimated that 0 64 3 85 kg of microfibers are retained in wwtp sludge each day with 0 01 0 06 kg being released into the aquatic environment based on our results we calculated that was samples contained 3 5 3 9 106 microfibers while uv treated effluent released 6 2 6 7 107 to the marine environment per day this is the first published study to demonstrate the fate of glitter during wastewater treatment processes by highlighting its abundance in was glitter particles are small enough to bypass the drum screen 1 5 mm during the primary treatment stage partitioning mainly to the sludge 24 due to the specific density of pbt c12h12o4 n and pet c10h8o4 density 1 31 1 38 g cm3 similarly a report in norway found that glitter accounted for 1 7 mps in sludge samples ranging from 261 to 509 μm in size with the majority being green pink yellow and clear in colour lusher et al 2018 our methodology detected black green yellow pink and red glitter ranging between 99 71 968 μm in size possible sources of glitter to wastewater are cosmetics fabrics and decorations from celebrations events in order to bring about the desired sparkling effect glitter usually consists of plastic particles coated in a fine layer of metallic or mineral compounds glitter may therefore be an additional contaminant in itself or serve as a vector for wastewater contaminants to the aquatic environment the estimated daily discharge of glitter particles was between 2 7 3 0 107 in was and 2 5 2 7 106 particles in effluent based on the average volume of wastewater treated by this plant so far this overlooked pollutant has not been addressed in detail however its size and shape aligns it with the classification of a primary mp tagg and ivar do sul 2019 fruit stickers have also not been addressed as an environmental plastic or pollutant yet they appear as litter throughout parks and public places our water utility industry partners acknowledged that fruit stickers are often encountered in the wastewater sludge personal communication despite being 2 cm 1 6 cm in size when elongated the identified fruit sticker made of thermoplastic polyurethane pu was observed in a was sample of the 2 mm sieve in a rolled up and compressed state this indicates that some larger objects such as fruit stickers are able to bypass the 1 5 mm drum screens during the de gritting phase fruit stickers present a potentially concerning newly identified mp as the chemicals used for adhesive purposes e g turpentine urea formaldehyde resins synthetic paraffin and petroleum may have detrimental biological effects over periods of long term exposure code of federal regulations title 21 food and drug administration 2012 possible sources of fruit stickers could be household drains and improper waste management practices the lack of colour change intact shape and remnants of adhesive on the underside of the sticker confirmed that current secondary treatment processes may not be capable of degrading this class of pollutant the text on the label fig s5 indicated that this was one among five popular varieties used on fruit and vegetables being sold in the region it is estimated that the 300 000 tonnes of apples alone are produced each year in australia which may be consumed with the skin on removed similarly other common fruits including avocados oranges mandarins and stone fruits are labelled with stickers that may be accidentally ingested or disposed of in various waste streams the hazardous effects of stickers resulting from their size chemical ingredients and potential for contaminant transport to marine life and humans have not yet been addressed the other commonly detected particles were abs pmma and pu abs thermoplastic provides high tensile strength is resistant to physical impacts and chemical corrosion pu particles derive from furniture adhesives such as construction glue products surface coating and sealing applications pmma is commonly used as a glass substitute in aircraft windows intraocular lenses and roofing compounds and in 3d printers for injection moulding the methyl acrylate monomer is known to cause thermal chemical damage despite its use in cranioplasty pikis et al 2015 while the chemical constituents of pmma including butadiene and styrene are possible human carcinogens in all the treatment stages the quantify of smaller particles was greater in the 125 μm 1 5 μm size range compared with the larger size classes this finding is crucial due to the fact smaller size particles will provide a greater specific area for adsorption of hazardous chemicals and microbial growth hoellein et al 2014 moore 2008 mps are insoluble in water non degradable and possess different physicochemical properties and these dominant factors determine their bioavailability to organisms carbery et al 2018 rocha santos and duarte 2015 secondary mps were present in greater quantities than primary mps in each treatment stage previously in effluents from australian wastewater treatment facilities it was reported that pet fibers and pe particles were the most abundant microplastic types browne et al 2011 ziajahromi et al 2017 interestingly in one study microbeads from pcps were not detected in any of the treated effluent samples yang et al 2019 this highlights that differences in the wastewater catchment and individual treatment facilities may significantly impact the emission of mps from wwtps previous studies have reported a mp removal efficiency ranging from 64 to 99 56 for secondary treatment facilities gies et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017b here we report a reduction in overall mp loads of 76 61 for effluent and 32 96 for was several limitations were observed in our methodology such as the high cost of chemicals the discolouring of cellulose filter discs by various solutions and the sensitivity of nai to increased temperatures we are therefore still exploring and developing superior methods the nile red co staining effect on partially digested biological matter can also interfere with visual identification via atr ftir or raman spectroscopy due to particle fluorescence shim et al 2016 polymer identification is considered one of the disadvantages of nile red particularly for black particles such as polyester which exhibited poor fluorescence stanton et al 2019 this is because raman spectra can be affected by coloured matter additives and other pollutants that are potentially attached to mps lenz et al 2015 removal of absorbed nile red de staining or improved spectroscopy facilities would certainly improve the chemical characterization of polymers additionally due to the small diameters microfibers can burn under raman and ftir furthermore some mps particularly those extracted form wastewater and environmental samples may have other impurities that inhibit the ability to obtain a clear spectrum as a result this may hinder the identification process and lead to a high chance of false estimation using raman or ftir for wastewater samples zhu et al 2019 5 conclusion this first study on mps in a regional australian wwtp indicates that mps were present throughout all stages of the treatment process and are released to the pacific ocean in high quantities via was and final treated effluent on a daily basis furthermore high concentrations of glitter were detected in wastewater sludge suggesting that glitter constitutes a major source of primary microplastics that require further remedial attention this information can be used to inform the relevant water management authority and potentially help to develop better onsite management practices to reduce mp concentrations in final discharged effluents with reference to the quantification and characterization of these plastic particles the impacts on wastewater treatment processes and plastic particles themselves represent an area that requires much more scientific attention our ongoing research focuses on the transport potential chemical and biological wastewater contaminants on marine life and mechanisms to reduce mp concentrations in final

18127,eutrophication of water bodies markedly reduces their recreational and economic use which in turn compels those interested to pursuing prompt and effective restoration this also applies to waters with a moderate pool of biogenic resources which following temporarily increased nutrient alimentation from the catchment area may become eutrophic the in situ experiment tested the impact of chemical restoration on benthic macroalgae chara hispida l found in meso eutrophic waters commonly used doses of iron sulphate were applied defined as low 10 8 g fe m 2 and high 21 6 g fe m 2 it was presumed that the sudden shift of abiotic conditions of the environment will disturb growth and stoichiometry of the species analyses encompassed physicochemical water parameters e g nutrient concentration light availability morphological features and elemental composition of the charophytes application of the coagulant caused shading of the plants and elimination of bioavailable phosphates from the water this induced changes of behavioural ecology of the species manifesting in elongation of the main axis and increase of the assimilation area growth of branchlets and side axes as well as stoichiometric changes it was found that shortage of phosphates in the water resulted in decreased phosphorus concentration in the thalli due to biological dilution the increase of assimilation area and phosphorus dilution in the thalli have not been previously reported for charophytes in this study the qualitative transformation of the environment following application of iron as part of chemical lake restoration was evinced in significant ecological changes that adversely affected macrophytobenthos the findings of the experiment can therefore be taken into account while planning restoration procedures so as to preclude the risk of a negative trend of ecological changes keywords lake restoration iron coagulant field experiment chara hispida macrophytobenthos 1 introduction ecological stoichiometry provides a useful tool to investigate interdependencies between elements affecting the structure of organisms their associations with the environment and reciprocal relations in the biotope sterner and elser 2002 carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p are three essential elements of organisms and have significant impact on biological functioning ågren 2004 elser et al 2000 however it is well known that many other elements such as iron fe and sulphur s are also important for organisms growth in plants fe is required for the formation of photosynthetic pigments and the functioning of the key enzyme in photosynthesis rubisco winder and nishio 1995 s is involved in chlorophyll formation as well as required for the production of amino acids proteins vitamins and enzymes droux 2004 both elements may be factors which restrict the development of primary producers in aquatic environment therefore it would seem important to expand the classical approach based exclusively on the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 in numerous aquatic ecosystems the stoichiometry of biogenic components n and p in particular changes due to increasing burden of in flowing nutrients the process itself known as eutrophication as well as its aftermath has been quite extensively explored and described cooke et al 2005 hilt et al 2006 søndergaard et al 2003 van drecht et al 2009 at the same time responding to increased fertility of water bodies has become one of the major civilizational challenges in the early 21st century management and controlling eutrophication processes are addressed by science politics and economics pretty et al 2003 diversified methods of water restoration are used to counter the negative effects of eutrophication however their main aim is to stimulate processes of re oligotrophication flaim et al 2016 restoration is undertaken around the world and a number of procedures are actually required by applicable law e g european union s water framework directive 2000 60 ec still it needs to be borne in mind that chemical intervention into concentrations of biogenic components water rearrangements of trophic networks or disturbances of biogeochemical cycles lead to changes in the stoichiometry of macroelements cooke et al 2005 gulati et al 2008 lürling and van oosterhout 2013 rosińska et al 2018 primary producers are the first biotic component affected and regulated by environmental stoichiometry from the standpoint of restoration macrophytobenthos with particular emphasis on charophytes constitutes the most crucial ecological group at the same time that group is the most exposed to restoration treatments charophytes charophyceae stoneworts are a group of freshwater macroalgae in the phylum charophyta their communities are a common component of the littoral zone in a variety of water bodies from very shallow to deep ones kufel and kufel 2002 they serve as ecological engineers by forming dense underwater beds charophytes decrease nutrient levels through uptake reduce of turbidity by trapping sediments and provide refuge for zooplankton and habitat and food base for animals blindow et al 2002 liu et al 2014 søndergaard et al 2007 for this reason charophytes rank among the most valuable assets in all freshwater ecosystems despite the fact that charophytes are supposed to be a typical component of high transparency high alkaline and nutrient poor lakes certain species also inhabit meso eutrophic and eutrophic water bodies with high concentrations of suspension pukacz et al 2013 water ecosystems characterised by such ecological state are more vulnerable to restoration treatments especially when there is an urgent need to implement the guidelines of the water framework directive directive 2000 restoration procedures are occasionally carried out in lakes which display higher trophic state transitionally natural fluctuations for instance as a result of incidental influx of biogens sobczyński and joniak 2009a szeląg wasielewska 2006 most often higher trophic state causes phytoplankton blooms and deterioration of water quality with e g increased turbidity unpleasant odour of the water anoxia paerl and huisman 2008 rosińska et al 2017a sobczyński and joniak 2009a this restricts recreational and economic use of water bodies brooks et al 2016 while social pressure compels one to apply restoration methods which ensure prompt effects the most frequently applied method of restoration is chemical inactivation of phosphates which brings about nearly immediate improvement of water quality at relatively low cost jančula and maršálek 2011 zamparas and zacharias 2014 the procedure consists in introduction of inorganic coagulants acidic solutions of iron or aluminium salts which bind phosphates into complex compounds dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 sobczyński and joniak 2009b the additional effect of coagulants is formation of flocs whose large absorption surface facilitates elimination of suspensions including phytoplankton subsequently the resulting complexes are gravity sedimented to bottom sediments nevertheless the ecosystem of a lake may be critically affected by the biological outcomes induced by the use of coagulants the impact is not always predictable while the scale of risks associated with adverse changes in the biocoenoses has not been fully explored studies to date tend to overlook the direct influence of the chemical substances used in restoration on the organisms found in a given ecosystem the findings available at this point focus on the alteration or reconstruction of particular plant communities following changes of environmental conditions hilt et al 2006 rosińska et al 2017b but works which analyse the responses of selected species are for the most part lacking studies concerned with the responses of charophytes are very few and rely on laboratory experiments immers et al 2013 rybak et al 2017a the only exception in that respect is rybak et al 2017b which reports on a field mesocosm experiment involving aluminium coagulant so far it has been demonstrated that coagulants do affect growth and proliferation of charophytes but the response is species dependent immers et al 2013 rybak et al 2017a therefore the aim of this study was to explore physiological and behavioural response of chara hispida to environmental changes under iron phosphate coagulant in a field experiment and determine whether potential changes are linked to c n p s and fe content our hypothesis presumed that a forceful and abrupt shift of environmental condition would cause main axis elongation but simultaneously inhibit development of other parts of charophytes as well as change their ecological stoichiometry due to phosphate elimination in order to achieve the above goal a field mesocosm experiment was carried out to enable analysis of the broadest possible range of environmental changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study species the species selected for the study was chara hispida l which represents the genus chara characeae charophyta widely distributed in europe north africa and asia krause 1997 the species prefers neutral and alkaline waters gąbka 2009 haas 1994 and as a characteristic trait displays wide tolerance to a range of available light radiation andrews et al 1984 c hispida grows on organic bottom sediments at depths from 1 to 3 m generally in the form of monospecific charophyte meadows in europe it is encountered in shallow meso eutrophic and eutrophic lakes as well as in waters with slightly acidic ph such as peatland exploitation ponds or humic water bodies haas 1994 urbaniak and gąbka 2014 it is one of the largest representatives of the genus the length of the main axis ranges from 0 3 to 2 0 m with a diameter up to 4 mm internode lengths measure 10 15 cm while branchlets 7 11 per node grow up to 8 cm in length it is a monoecious plant which produces single oogonia and brown to black oospores krause 1997 urbaniak and gąbka 2014 due to habitat requirements c hispida communities are strongly vulnerable to restoration treatments 2 2 experiment design the experiment was carried out in the meso eutrophic wielkowiejskie lake area 13 3 ha max depth 4 0 m located in western poland n 52 17 43 e 16 40 5 the lake is characterised by well developed charophyte communities and a wide belt of helophytes along the shore the mesocosms were steel structures 1 1 2 m protected against corrosion with walls made from transparent light transmitting polyethylene foil six such chambers open at the top and bottom to allow contact with the sediments and the atmosphere were embedded in the lake sediment layer to a depth of 30 cm to limit water infiltration the walls protruded to 20 cm above the water level thus excluding water inflow caused by waves consequently each chamber had a volume of 1 m3 the mesocosms were inhabited exclusively by c hispida with the same density of approx 50 shoots per m2 having been installed in the charophyte meadow the chambers were left at the site for 1 month to stabilize conditions the chambers were placed in the central section of the community where its individuals had similar dimensions and showed similar density of growth while specimens of other species were absent also all chambers were ensured identical exposure to climatic factors subsequently baseline conditions were determined and thereafter iron sulphate was applied time tstart the study was carried out over a period of 9 weeks time tend spanning july and september 2 3 iron application and sampling the substance used in the experiment was iron iii sulphate fe2 so4 3 due to its strong coagulation and flocculation features it is widely used in lake restoration processes iron sulphate is characterised by low ph 1 0 density of 1 5 1 57 g cm 3 and strong dark brown colour the coagulant was applied into the designated chambers once in either concentration low 10 8 g fe m 2 and high 21 6 g fe m 2 both iron concentrations applied in the study are commonly used in lake restoration treatments all over the world cooke et al 2005 orihel et al 2016 such concentration causes immediate improvement of the visual features of water elimination of phytoplankton blooms and substances responsible for water colour concentrations used in the study were determined in a prior laboratory experiment in which the value of the low concentration was adopted as above while high concentration was assumed to be twice as much mesocosm without iron addition served as the control the entire system was duplicated only once owing to the size of c hispida habitat where the same conditions were ascertained in the process of iron sulphate application the water was swirled gently for better dispersion of coagulant the measurements and collection of water samples for chemical analysis were performed once a week at the same time 12 00 p m

measured at the water surface and at the depth where charophytes occurred using a quantum meter with a spherical sensor li 193sa li cor biosciences in each measurement cycle 10 readings were taken within the space of 10 s due to the diurnal dynamics of solar height above the horizon sampling was performed between 12 p m and 1 p m the light extinction coefficient kd par was calculated as follows kd par lni 0 lni d d where d is the water depth i 0 and i d are par at the water surface and at depth d respectively kirk 2010 water samples for chemical analyses 1 dm3 were acquired just above the community without disturbing the colloid sediment on the charophytes and preserved with sulphuric acid or nitric acid depending on the parameter samples of c hispida were collected as chemical samples once a week 4 individuals from each chamber after transportation to the laboratory in sealed plastic bags with a small amount of water the specimens were analysed on the same day each plant was measured for main axis total length side axis lengths longest branchlet in a node nodes i iii and internode lengths up to node iii of both the main axis and the side axes organic matter om was determined after ashing 2 h 550 c and weighted with 0 0001g accuracy based on this parameter relative growth rate was calculated hunt 1990 according the formula rgr lnx 2 lnx 1 t 2 t 1 where x 1 and x 2 were the mean algal organic matter content at time t 1 and t 2 start and end of experiment respectively the analysis of organic matter content and elemental analysis were performed only on 50 cm long apical sections of the sampled charophyte individuals 2 4 chemical analyses ammonium nitrogen n nh4 nitrate nitrogen n no3 total nitrogen tn phosphates trp total phosphorus tp were determined by standard spectrophotometric methods apha 1999 total calcium ca and total magnesium mg were analysed by edta titrimetric method iso 6058 1984 sulphate so4 by gravimetric method using barium chloride iso 9280 1990 fe concentration in the water was analysed using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas chlorophyll a chl a and pheophytin a pheo were determined spectrophotometrically with hot ethanol pn iso 10260 2002 charophytes for elemental analysis 4 specimens from each chamber were cleaned from surface contamination prior to analysis first in tap water next in deionized water then dried on paper towel and in a dryer at 80 c to obtain dry weight d w the dry mass was ground in a porcelain mortar fe concentration in the algae was analysed using aas representative samples of 0 50 g of algae in the form of powder were mineralized in nitric acid sigma aldrich using the mars xpress cem international microwave mineralization system following the three step program 400 w 100 c 2 min 600 w 160 c 5 min 1600 w 200 c 10 min after mineralization the solutions were filtered using filter paper and diluted with deionized water to a volume of 50 cm3 this procedure was repeated three times for each sample the concentration of fe in the algae samples after mineralization and in the water samples was determined using spectra 280 aa spectrometer agilent technologies equipped with a single element varian hollow cathode lamp the calibration curve was prepared before the analysis with four replicates based on a series of freshly prepared standard solutions obtained from stock standard fe solution at 1 mg g 1 concentration sigma aldrich in order to confirm reliability of the results the analysis of the certified reference material ncs dc 73351 tea was performed final results consisted of median values from three simultaneous measurements the content of basic elements c n s in charophytes was analysed using the elemental analyser flash 2000 series thermo fisher scientific in chns o configuration the samples were weighted in tin capsules with the addition of vanadium pentoxide thermo fisher scientific the instrument was calibrated with standard bbot 2 5 bis 5 tert butyl benzoxazol 2 yl thiophene thermo fisher scientific and certified birch leaf standard elemental microanalysis ltd as reference material correctness of the method was verified by elemental analysis of the certified reference material alfalfa elemental microanalysis ltd samples selected to assess p concentration in charophyte samples were first digested using sulphuric acid hydrogen peroxide and sulphuric acid perchloric acid respectively total p concentration in thalli was determined using the molybdate acid method sparks 1996 su et al 2019 2 5 statistical analyses the shapiro wilk test was used to verify normal distribution the levene test was applied to assess the equality of variances for groups assumption of sphericity was tested by means of mauchly s test followed by greenhouse geisser tests if the mauchly test were to prove insignificant the differences between control and experimental treatments with respect to physicochemical parameters as well as organic matter content length of main axis side axes and their number were assessed by within subjects analysis of variance with iron addition treatment as fixed factors and time as the repeated factor followed by tukey multiple comparisons test one way anova was used to examine rgr differences between treatments effects of iron sulphate concentration and time of experiment on the variation of c hispida traits length of branchlets and internodes were estimated using general linear mixed effect models glmm with treatments as random factor and post hoc hsd tukey test pinheiro and bates 2000 the second model was run to check iron impact on c n p s fe stoichiometric characteristics all the above statistical analyses were conducted using statistica 13 5 software standardised main axis regression sma was used to fit a line for the log10 transformed n p concentrations in c hispida thalli against the log10 transformed n p concentrations in water and to compare the slopes of these lines among the treatments warton et al 2006 sma was conducted using smart function in r version 3 4 2 the stoichiometric homeostasis coefficient h n p was calculated according to equation log y log c 1 h log x where y is n p ratio in charophytes thalli x is n p ratio in resources and c is constant sterner and elser 2002 calculations were performed based on dissolved forms in the surrounding environment since only those can be taken up by macrophytes reynolds and davies 2001 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions following the application of iron sulphate significant changes were observed only in some of the parameters from among the entire analysed set most notably slight acidification of water and ec increase ensued in both treatments table 1 the coagulant caused complete elimination of phosphates in the water an effect which was sustained almost until the end of the experiment in the final week the concentration increased to the level observed in control impact of the coagulant on the concentrations of mineral nitrogen forms was not determined as their level remained stable and within similar values in all chambers analysis demonstrated increased concentration of ca ions in the low treatment whereas in the high treatment chambers the concentration remained at a level similar to control no differences of the kind were observed with respect to mg application of the coagulant resulted in a substantial increase of fe concentrations over 10 fold for the low dosage and over 25 fold for the high dosage in comparison with control the concentrations would decrease over time approaching control values at the end of experiment sulphate ions were added along with the coagulant but significant concentration increases of the latter were determined only in the low treatment chamber compared to control in the high treatment sulphate concentration did not diverge much from control application of the coagulant also affected light availability due to deterioration of physical properties in the low treatment water colour increased to 324 4 mg pt dm 3 mean stand dev and reached 582 4 mg pt dm 3 in the high treatment vs 32 4 mg pt dm 3 in control analogous outcomes were observed with respect to turbidity which increased to 16 9 0 4 ntu in the low treatment and to 35 4 1 5 ntu in the high treatment vs 0 8 0 3 ntu in control increased colour and turbidity had a significant impact on the light extinction coefficient kd par which registered 4 fold increase in the low treatment over 10 fold in the high treatment translating into par reduction by 50 in the low treatment and by 90 in high those severe environmental shifts lasted for 72 h coagulation and flocculation of particles over that period caused the thalli of charophytes to become thoroughly covered with a viscous colloid substance the amount of the suspension was proportional to the dose of iron sulphate the remaining analysed parameters did not display statistically significant differences table 1 3 2 growth of chara hispida specimens of c hispida in the low and high treatments differed considerably in their biometric parameters under the influence of iron sulphate table 2 differences were recorded especially with respect to the length of main axis and the length of branchlets in all nodes in comparison to the control individuals main axis length increased in both treatment modalities but only in the low variant were they statistically significant table 3 as for the length of internode i significant elongation was noted in the low treatment 31 longer than in control marked differences were found in the lengths of internodes ii and iii where the variation in elongation was significant compared to control 42 40 in low and 23 33 in high respectively overall greater elongation of internodes was observed for the low concentration fig 1 with regard to the length of branchlets the reverse was the case greater elongation was noted in the high treatment with the exception of comparable elongation in node i in the low treatment branchlet length in nodes ii and iii increased significantly by approximately 20 and 12 respectively whereas corresponding branchlets in the high were 26 internode ii and 25 internode iii longer than in control fig 1 despite the tendency for the side axes to increase the difference was statistically significant only for the length of the first order side axes between control and the low treatments table 3 in terms of the number of branches there were no significant changes the rgr did not exhibit changes between treatments at tstart charophytes did not show developed oospores and did not form any in the course of the experiment 3 3 chara hispida stoichiometric thalli concentrations of the analysed elements were characterized by relatively high stability changes were observed in p and fe concentration simultaneously demonstrating significance of the entire model table 2 c content in the thalli did not differ statistically between treatment modalities registering approximate values of 220 mg g 1 d w n concentration was slightly increased only in the low treatment with no significant difference with respect to control p concentrations displayed statistical differences between the low treatment where a drop by ca 35 0 7 mg g 1 d w occurred and control and the high treatment approx 1 0 mg g 1 d w in the high modality p concentration was only 10 lower than in control fig 2 despite sulphate supplementation as component part of the coagulant s content in the thalli was constant within a range approaching 4 5 mg s g 1 d w in contrast to s concentration fe ions in the thalli from the chambers with iron sulphate addition increased significantly in the low treatment fe concentration was over 10 fold higher than in control 0 14 mg g 1 d w and in the high treatment it increased to 2 3 mg g 1 d w fig 2 the c n p ratio for c hispida thalli in the control treatment was 530 16 1 mol mol 1 and did not deviate much from the high treatment 556 17 1 mol mol 1 in the low treatment however it increased to 800 24 1 mol mol 1 average c n ratio increased in the low treatment to 34 1 mol mol 1 and differed significantly from control c n 31 mol mol 1 p 0 01 as well as high treatment c n 32 1 mol mol 1 p 0 05 pronounced changes were observed with respect to c p which increased in the low dosage to 805 1 mol mol 1 thus differing significantly from control 539 1 mol mol 1 and the high dosage 558 1 mol mol 1 p 0 05 the n p ratio in the control and high chambers was respectively 17 1 and 18 1 mol mol 1 whereas in the low treatment chambers it reached 25 1 mol mol 1 in all treatments n p content in c hispida increased as the water n p concentration increased the value of stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients h n p for the control treatment was 2 9 while in the low and high treatments h n p 0 9 however it was significant only for the low treatment also results of multiple comparisons among the groups showed differences between low and the other treatment modalities table 4 4 discussion the addition of iron sulphate resulted in several physicochemical changes in the abiotic environment both iron treatments caused significant changes but their intensity was dose dependent the first disturbances to occur in the habitat were decrease in water ph as well as increase in water colour and turbidity acidification changed the environmental conditions preferred by charophytes completely which in the context of chemical methods used in lake restoration represents an important and serious problem if charophyte communities are involved immers et al 2013 rybak et al 2017b the relatively rapid neutralisation of acidity was due to the dissolution of charophyte encrustation calcium and or magnesium carbonate with ca and mg ions being released into the water encrustation may constitute over 70 of dry biomass pełechaty et al 2013 therefore its dissolution causes disturbances in the calcium magnesium equilibrium resulting in calcification problems affecting metabolism and morphology as well gomes and asaeda 2010 rybak et al 2019 siong and asaeda 2009 in this study lower ca concentration in the high treatment was associated with so4 and as the caso4 solubility equilibrium has been exceeded it resulted in hard soluble salt precipitation this outcome was observed in charophyte meadows where dissolution of ca encrustation was accompanied by high sulphate supply rybak et al 2019 alkalinisation was supported by the photosynthetic process through depletion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen carbonate ions smith and bidwell 1989 it should be emphasised that this process took place in a limited space dominated by charophytes neutralisation of acidity in a water body with a large pelagic area may not be as effective and in the long term it can lead to the transformation of a given habitat iron sulphate accomplished the primary goal of its application as it completely eliminated phosphates from the water column orihel et al 2016 zamparas et al 2012 and produced a lasting effect phosphate concentration increased to the level observed in the control chambers only in the final week of the experiment that increase owed to natural fluctuations of nutrient concentration following seasonal temperature drop autumn and decelerated charophyte metabolism in colder periods nutrient uptake is suppressed in those plants thus their concentration in water increases aerts and chapin 1999 coagulant application did not affect concentration of nitrogen forms which should be attributed to the chemical properties of coagulants another adversely affected factor was light availability which is crucial for charophyte growth kufel and kufel 2002 rip et al 2007 over a short term iron sulphate caused increase of water colour and turbidity as well as reduction in par availability simultaneously iron phosphate complexation processes occurred leading subsequently to precipitation flocculation and sedimentation of aggregates flocs pizarro et al 1995 which formed a sticky dark brown sediment layer on the charophytes it significantly reduced the amount of light penetrating into the charophyte thalli in the long term in such conditions despite improved light transparency in the water column charophytes were exposed to the stress of shading immers et al 2013 rybak et al 2017a the plants phenotype is regulated by environmental and genetic factors but phenotypic plasticity is considered an adaptive trait of plants enabling them to deal with abiotic environmental variables cronin and lodge 2003 harvell 1990 three types of behavioural reactions were observed with respect to charophyte meadows as modes of responding to changes in environmental conditions 1 intensification the growth of the main axis 2 increased growth rate of the branchlets and 3 increased growth rate of the first order side axes while the first reaction is common and consists in rapid elongation towards the water surface blindow et al 2003 blindow and schütte 2007 the subsequent are at odds with the typical defence mechanism against light limitation as expected c hispida intensified its growth towards the water surface to compensate for the negative effects of shading such a response occurs in a situation of severe limitation of sunlight availability due to changes in the optical characteristics of water or intensive growth of neighbouring individuals leading to a higher density of population blindow and schütte 2007 charophytes are characterized by apical growth followed by differentiation into nodes and internodes thus the upper internodal cells do not usually reach their maximal size piazza et al 2005 torn et al 2006 decreasing light availability resulted in greater internode lengths which may be perceived as an adaptive response whereby the branchlet rosette is repositioned closer to water surface where light intensity is greater this may explain more substantial elongation of the internodes ii and iii in all treatments internode i was significantly elongated only in the low treatment in which the algae were subject to less stress at the same time the length of the main axis in the high treatment was inhibited compared to the low treatment such reactions should be interpreted as the effect of excessive stress in the high treatment this had been confirmed in laboratory conditions where c hispida exposed to the same iron concentrations displayed inhibited growth rate and oospore production rybak et al 2017a these individuals despite the mobilization of reserves to achieve fast elongation had to allocate some of them to survival in adverse environmental conditions kozłowski 1992 in this study the changes in algae structure intensive growth branching were not directly reflected in increased organic matter being indicative of redirected resource allocation rather than synthesis of new molecules as regards the dimensions of branchlets the study showed a significant increase in the length of branchlets in both iron treatments a branchlet rosette can constitute the main assimilation area therefore extension of this area is a desirable feature in adverse light conditions middelboe and markager 1997 owens et al 2008 moreover high concentration of photosynthetic pigments in the apical parts caused photosynthetic activity to be highest in these particular regions in c hispida andrews et al 1984 however branchlets in the lower nodes tend to be longer and almost horizontally oriented which increases their photosynthetic efficiency as well schneider et al 2015 here the increase in branchlets was most evident in the high iron treatments suggesting that the energy investment to promote development of branchlet rosettes and thus augment the assimilation area was decidedly higher than in elongation towards light this may indicate that an enlarged assimilation area may be an alternative defence mechanism against light limitation additionally an increase in the surface area of individual specimens followed the elongation of existing side axis a mechanism also observed in a laboratory experiment in which c hispida was exposed to iron sulphate rybak et al 2017a in this study the first order side axes were elongated only in the low treatment which could be interpreted as a response to the maximal shading level consisting in full allocation of energy to vegetative growth under the strongest stimulus no significant branch elongation was noted this means that the strength of stress stimulus in the low treatment triggered the most comprehensive response to shading on the other hand that growth tendency of the side axes coupled with their greater number enhances disintegration capacity this is connected with the production of new small sized individuals of bociąg and rekowska 2012 which will have a chance to change their ecological niche e g move to shallower better illuminated waters where their development would be ensured behavioural changes owing to environmental disturbances were accompanied by shifting c n p stoichiometry and fe concentrations in c hispida it may be noted however that application of iron sulphate and considerable increase of water sulphate concentration did not affect s concentration in the thalli demonstrating that those ions were not accumulated by c hispida in any case high sulphate concentration represents a hazard to organisms only in anaerobic conditions when sulphates are reduced to toxic sulphides van der welle et al 2007 the risk is therefore negligible in the well oxygenated charophytes communities kufel and kufel 2002 the c n p ratio in the control treatment was higher than in other submersed macrophytes demars and edwards 2008 fernández aláez et al 1999 but it was still similar to the ratio described previously for c hispida puche and rodrigo 2015 rojo et al 2017 these results are coherent with earlier findings indicating that charophytes contain less n and p than angiosperms wang et al 2018 xing et al 2013b higher c p and n p ratios observed in this study were most likely caused by low phosphorous levels submerged macrophytes may be impacted by environmental conditions such as water and sediment nutrient concentrations water depth and light availability jackson et al 1991 xing et al 2013b yuan et al 2017 while investigations to date suggest that inconsistent stoichiometry of individuals depends largely on species variation broadley et al 2004 demars and edwards 2008 li et al 2015 the environment which they inhabit plays a major role in their elemental composition lacoul and freedman 2006 thalli c was unaffected by phosphates and light limitation caused by coagulant application nonetheless low light intensity and lack of bioavailable phosphates resulted in lower p concentration in thalli and higher c n c p and n p ratios though only in the low treatment in both treatments carbon exhibited stable concentration and remained unrelated to n or p concentration changes indicating that the structural role of c was independent from the biochemical roles played by these nutrients demars and edwards 2007 the study also demonstrated relatively high stability of n concentrations although it needs to be noted that it was not a limiting factor and its bioavailable forms were present in the water throughout the experiment at the same time the slightly elevated c n ratio may have been due to cells intensive development and insufficient n uptake process at this growth rate this resulted in n dilution in thalli a slight decreased in its concentration and an increased in relation to c viaroli et al 2005 moreover the elevated c n ratio may result not only from the nitrogen dilution but also from the accumulation of carbonaceous compatible solutes the latter provide energy reserves protect cells against environmental stress and are expended when biomass reaches a certain critical level welsh 2000 on the other hand p concentration decreased significantly in the plants subjected to the low treatment rapid growth of the main axis side axes and the development of branchlets in the conditions of phosphate ion shortage led to the dilution of p accumulated in the thalli vegetal growth is inhibited in infertile environments mainly by external n and p availability therefore rapid growth of plants due to low light stress dilutes n and p concentrations in plant tissues and in consequence cause higher c n and c p ratios cronin and lodge 2003 li et al 2013 yan et al 2006 it is perfectly logical to assume that autotrophs growth requires proteins n based which are integral to p based rrna and atp conley et al 2009 demars and edwards 2008 previous studies discussing the mechanism of tissue dilution were concerned exclusively with vascular plants in which resources were allocated to the stem often at the expense of roots or leaves fu et al 2012 strand and weisner 2001 our study demonstrates that the mechanism also functions in stoneworts which as thallophytes do not possess developed tissues or conducting structures absorbing all necessary elements solely from water gąbka 2009 application of iron sulphate resulted in a substantial increase of fe concentration in the water which in turn affected the amount of fe accumulated in the thalli however fe content determined in this study cannot be easily confronted with the results of other investigations due to lack of findings relating to charophytes various forms of available iron different fe concentrations in the medium and different times of exposure see xing et al 2013a at the same time addition of 25 100 g m 2 fe does not affect growth and development of such macrophytes as elodea nuttallii stuckenia pectinata potamogeton acutifolius stratiotes aloides myriophyllum aquaticum and chara virgata bakker et al 2016 and cited there absence of signs of inhibited development surface reduction of the branchlets necrotic spots on leaves or disturbed formation of new branchlets indicate non toxic impact of iron immers et al 2013 van der welle et al 2007 also presence of fe in the control samples rules out iron limitation this is a frequently observed phenomenon in lakes with carbonate rich bottom sediments where precipitation of iron from carbonates is a significant regulator of macroalgal development rozan et al 2002 the indirect effect of iron described above increase of colour turbidity and formation of sediment on the thalli proves more harmful than its potential toxic effect in the cells ecological stoichiometry denotes the capacity of an organism to maintain constant elemental composition and ratios irrespective of environmental fluctuation of such elements sterner and elser 2002 as well as reflects physiological and biochemical adaptation of the organism to the surrounding environment hessen et al 2004 the capacity for regulation depends on the limitation of resources physiological constraints and growth rate potential sistla et al 2015 the available studies of aquatic plants demonstrate their potent ability for stoichiometric regulation demars and edwards 2007 li et al 2015 however this experiment shows that individual stoichiometric traits may vary within one species depending on the environmental resources c hispida individuals from the control chambers were characterized by relatively strong homeostasis which was nevertheless retained in a narrow range of n p concentrations and with a phosphate concentration that was low in any case application of iron salts caused the thalli to be shaded and eliminated phosphates inducing a behavioural change and as h n p indicates disrupting homeostasis in charophytes sterner and elser 2002 the strongest response of c hispida observed in the low treatment caused the most extensive homeostatic disturbance that owed primarily to the decreased p concentration in the thalli this should be attributed to the high costs of maintaining growth or proliferation rate under stress which manifests in diminished homeostasis boersma and kreutzer 2002 nevertheless such a result would validate the hypothesis that stoichiometric homeostasis is an approximate rather than precise value because organisms have to respond constantly to the changing availability of resources wang et al 2012 it has to be stressed therefore that biogeochemical pathways and homeostatic control are mechanisms in which nutrient shifts regulate trophodynamic structure glibert 2012 disturbances in such processes especially sudden ones e g application of iron sulphate may hinder the community s ability to return to its original state even when the disruptive factors are eliminated this is accounted for by the alternate stable state theory which posits that a system maintains stability until environmental changes or disturbances occur scheffer and carpenter 2003 consequently not only eutrophication su et al 2019 but also re oligotrophication processes destabilize ecosystems by inhibiting homeostatic macrophyte communities therefore the response of the community to environmental shift changes in the relative composition of nutrients ecological stoichiometry and the resulting hysteresis which supersedes previous homeostasis are critical factors affecting its further existence when such community is exposed to chemical restoration procedures 5 conclusions behaviour of c hispida suggests that rapid elongation towards water surface is not the only mechanism against shading the alternative consists in an augmentation of the assimilation area through branchlets and side axis elongation stronger response in charophytes subjected to 10 8 g fe m 2 indicates that the 21 6 g fe m 2 led to excessive stress which reduced the amount of energy allocated to growth intensified growth disturbed elemental stoichiometry and homeostasis but only phosphorus was diluted in the growing thalli due to the limited availability of that element nevertheless the restoration induced stoichiometric imbalance is a dangerous process and may destabilize the community functioning neither 10 8 g fe m 2 nor 21 6 g fe m 2 in form of iron sulphate caused the community of c hispida to disappear the obtained findings may contribute to better understanding and development of restoration methods based on phosphorus inactivation as such they carry considerable practical relevance for lake management in light of increasing eutrophication declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

18127,eutrophication of water bodies markedly reduces their recreational and economic use which in turn compels those interested to pursuing prompt and effective restoration this also applies to waters with a moderate pool of biogenic resources which following temporarily increased nutrient alimentation from the catchment area may become eutrophic the in situ experiment tested the impact of chemical restoration on benthic macroalgae chara hispida l found in meso eutrophic waters commonly used doses of iron sulphate were applied defined as low 10 8 g fe m 2 and high 21 6 g fe m 2 it was presumed that the sudden shift of abiotic conditions of the environment will disturb growth and stoichiometry of the species analyses encompassed physicochemical water parameters e g nutrient concentration light availability morphological features and elemental composition of the charophytes application of the coagulant caused shading of the plants and elimination of bioavailable phosphates from the water this induced changes of behavioural ecology of the species manifesting in elongation of the main axis and increase of the assimilation area growth of branchlets and side axes as well as stoichiometric changes it was found that shortage of phosphates in the water resulted in decreased phosphorus concentration in the thalli due to biological dilution the increase of assimilation area and phosphorus dilution in the thalli have not been previously reported for charophytes in this study the qualitative transformation of the environment following application of iron as part of chemical lake restoration was evinced in significant ecological changes that adversely affected macrophytobenthos the findings of the experiment can therefore be taken into account while planning restoration procedures so as to preclude the risk of a negative trend of ecological changes keywords lake restoration iron coagulant field experiment chara hispida macrophytobenthos 1 introduction ecological stoichiometry provides a useful tool to investigate interdependencies between elements affecting the structure of organisms their associations with the environment and reciprocal relations in the biotope sterner and elser 2002 carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p are three essential elements of organisms and have significant impact on biological functioning ågren 2004 elser et al 2000 however it is well known that many other elements such as iron fe and sulphur s are also important for organisms growth in plants fe is required for the formation of photosynthetic pigments and the functioning of the key enzyme in photosynthesis rubisco winder and nishio 1995 s is involved in chlorophyll formation as well as required for the production of amino acids proteins vitamins and enzymes droux 2004 both elements may be factors which restrict the development of primary producers in aquatic environment therefore it would seem important to expand the classical approach based exclusively on the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 in numerous aquatic ecosystems the stoichiometry of biogenic components n and p in particular changes due to increasing burden of in flowing nutrients the process itself known as eutrophication as well as its aftermath has been quite extensively explored and described cooke et al 2005 hilt et al 2006 søndergaard et al 2003 van drecht et al 2009 at the same time responding to increased fertility of water bodies has become one of the major civilizational challenges in the early 21st century management and controlling eutrophication processes are addressed by science politics and economics pretty et al 2003 diversified methods of water restoration are used to counter the negative effects of eutrophication however their main aim is to stimulate processes of re oligotrophication flaim et al 2016 restoration is undertaken around the world and a number of procedures are actually required by applicable law e g european union s water framework directive 2000 60 ec still it needs to be borne in mind that chemical intervention into concentrations of biogenic components water rearrangements of trophic networks or disturbances of biogeochemical cycles lead to changes in the stoichiometry of macroelements cooke et al 2005 gulati et al 2008 lürling and van oosterhout 2013 rosińska et al 2018 primary producers are the first biotic component affected and regulated by environmental stoichiometry from the standpoint of restoration macrophytobenthos with particular emphasis on charophytes constitutes the most crucial ecological group at the same time that group is the most exposed to restoration treatments charophytes charophyceae stoneworts are a group of freshwater macroalgae in the phylum charophyta their communities are a common component of the littoral zone in a variety of water bodies from very shallow to deep ones kufel and kufel 2002 they serve as ecological engineers by forming dense underwater beds charophytes decrease nutrient levels through uptake reduce of turbidity by trapping sediments and provide refuge for zooplankton and habitat and food base for animals blindow et al 2002 liu et al 2014 søndergaard et al 2007 for this reason charophytes rank among the most valuable assets in all freshwater ecosystems despite the fact that charophytes are supposed to be a typical component of high transparency high alkaline and nutrient poor lakes certain species also inhabit meso eutrophic and eutrophic water bodies with high concentrations of suspension pukacz et al 2013 water ecosystems characterised by such ecological state are more vulnerable to restoration treatments especially when there is an urgent need to implement the guidelines of the water framework directive directive 2000 restoration procedures are occasionally carried out in lakes which display higher trophic state transitionally natural fluctuations for instance as a result of incidental influx of biogens sobczyński and joniak 2009a szeląg wasielewska 2006 most often higher trophic state causes phytoplankton blooms and deterioration of water quality with e g increased turbidity unpleasant odour of the water anoxia paerl and huisman 2008 rosińska et al 2017a sobczyński and joniak 2009a this restricts recreational and economic use of water bodies brooks et al 2016 while social pressure compels one to apply restoration methods which ensure prompt effects the most frequently applied method of restoration is chemical inactivation of phosphates which brings about nearly immediate improvement of water quality at relatively low cost jančula and maršálek 2011 zamparas and zacharias 2014 the procedure consists in introduction of inorganic coagulants acidic solutions of iron or aluminium salts which bind phosphates into complex compounds dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 sobczyński and joniak 2009b the additional effect of coagulants is formation of flocs whose large absorption surface facilitates elimination of suspensions including phytoplankton subsequently the resulting complexes are gravity sedimented to bottom sediments nevertheless the ecosystem of a lake may be critically affected by the biological outcomes induced by the use of coagulants the impact is not always predictable while the scale of risks associated with adverse changes in the biocoenoses has not been fully explored studies to date tend to overlook the direct influence of the chemical substances used in restoration on the organisms found in a given ecosystem the findings available at this point focus on the alteration or reconstruction of particular plant communities following changes of environmental conditions hilt et al 2006 rosińska et al 2017b but works which analyse the responses of selected species are for the most part lacking studies concerned with the responses of charophytes are very few and rely on laboratory experiments immers et al 2013 rybak et al 2017a the only exception in that respect is rybak et al 2017b which reports on a field mesocosm experiment involving aluminium coagulant so far it has been demonstrated that coagulants do affect growth and proliferation of charophytes but the response is species dependent immers et al 2013 rybak et al 2017a therefore the aim of this study was to explore physiological and behavioural response of chara hispida to environmental changes under iron phosphate coagulant in a field experiment and determine whether potential changes are linked to c n p s and fe content our hypothesis presumed that a forceful and abrupt shift of environmental condition would cause main axis elongation but simultaneously inhibit development of other parts of charophytes as well as change their ecological stoichiometry due to phosphate elimination in order to achieve the above goal a field mesocosm experiment was carried out to enable analysis of the broadest possible range of environmental changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study species the species selected for the study was chara hispida l which represents the genus chara characeae charophyta widely distributed in europe north africa and asia krause 1997 the species prefers neutral and alkaline waters gąbka 2009 haas 1994 and as a characteristic trait displays wide tolerance to a range of available light radiation andrews et al 1984 c hispida grows on organic bottom sediments at depths from 1 to 3 m generally in the form of monospecific charophyte meadows in europe it is encountered in shallow meso eutrophic and eutrophic lakes as well as in waters with slightly acidic ph such as peatland exploitation ponds or humic water bodies haas 1994 urbaniak and gąbka 2014 it is one of the largest representatives of the genus the length of the main axis ranges from 0 3 to 2 0 m with a diameter up to 4 mm internode lengths measure 10 15 cm while branchlets 7 11 per node grow up to 8 cm in length it is a monoecious plant which produces single oogonia and brown to black oospores krause 1997 urbaniak and gąbka 2014 due to habitat requirements c hispida communities are strongly vulnerable to restoration treatments 2 2 experiment design the experiment was carried out in the meso eutrophic wielkowiejskie lake area 13 3 ha max depth 4 0 m located in western poland n 52 17 43 e 16 40 5 the lake is characterised by well developed charophyte communities and a wide belt of helophytes along the shore the mesocosms were steel structures 1 1 2 m protected against corrosion with walls made from transparent light transmitting polyethylene foil six such chambers open at the top and bottom to allow contact with the sediments and the atmosphere were embedded in the lake sediment layer to a depth of 30 cm to limit water infiltration the walls protruded to 20 cm above the water level thus excluding water inflow caused by waves consequently each chamber had a volume of 1 m3 the mesocosms were inhabited exclusively by c hispida with the same density of approx 50 shoots per m2 having been installed in the charophyte meadow the chambers were left at the site for 1 month to stabilize conditions the chambers were placed in the central section of the community where its individuals had similar dimensions and showed similar density of growth while specimens of other species were absent also all chambers were ensured identical exposure to climatic factors subsequently baseline conditions were determined and thereafter iron sulphate was applied time tstart the study was carried out over a period of 9 weeks time tend spanning july and september 2 3 iron application and sampling the substance used in the experiment was iron iii sulphate fe2 so4 3 due to its strong coagulation and flocculation features it is widely used in lake restoration processes iron sulphate is characterised by low ph 1 0 density of 1 5 1 57 g cm 3 and strong dark brown colour the coagulant was applied into the designated chambers once in either concentration low 10 8 g fe m 2 and high 21 6 g fe m 2 both iron concentrations applied in the study are commonly used in lake restoration treatments all over the world cooke et al 2005 orihel et al 2016 such concentration causes immediate improvement of the visual features of water elimination of phytoplankton blooms and substances responsible for water colour concentrations used in the study were determined in a prior laboratory experiment in which the value of the low concentration was adopted as above while high concentration was assumed to be twice as much mesocosm without iron addition served as the control the entire system was duplicated only once owing to the size of c hispida habitat where the same conditions were ascertained in the process of iron sulphate application the water was swirled gently for better dispersion of coagulant the measurements and collection of water samples for chemical analysis were performed once a week at the same time 12 00 p m

kd par lni 0 lni d d where d is the water depth i 0 and i d are par at the water surface and at depth d respectively kirk 2010 water samples for chemical analyses 1 dm3 were acquired just above the community without disturbing the colloid sediment on the charophytes and preserved with sulphuric acid or nitric acid depending on the parameter samples of c hispida were collected as chemical samples once a week 4 individuals from each chamber after transportation to the laboratory in sealed plastic bags with a small amount of water the specimens were analysed on the same day each plant was measured for main axis total length side axis lengths longest branchlet in a node nodes i iii and internode lengths up to node iii of both the main axis and the side axes organic matter om was determined after ashing 2 h 550 c and weighted with 0 0001g accuracy based on this parameter relative growth rate was calculated hunt 1990 according the formula rgr lnx 2 lnx 1 t 2 t 1 where x 1 and x

sulphuric acid perchloric acid respectively total p concentration in thalli was determined using the molybdate acid method sparks 1996 su et al 2019 2 5 statistical analyses the shapiro wilk test was used to verify normal distribution the levene test was applied to assess the equality of variances for groups assumption of sphericity was tested by means of mauchly s test followed by greenhouse geisser tests if the mauchly test were to prove insignificant the differences between control and experimental treatments with respect to physicochemical parameters as well as organic matter content length of main axis side axes and their number were assessed by within subjects analysis of variance with iron addition treatment as fixed factors and time as the repeated factor followed by tukey multiple comparisons test one way anova was used to examine rgr differences between treatments effects of iron sulphate concentration and time of experiment on the variation of c hispida traits length

to check iron impact on c n p s fe stoichiometric characteristics all the above statistical analyses were conducted using statistica 13 5 software standardised main axis regression sma was used to fit a line for the log10 transformed n p concentrations in c hispida thalli against the log10 transformed n p concentrations in water and to compare the slopes of these lines among the treatments warton et al 2006 sma was conducted using smart function in r version 3 4 2 the stoichiometric homeostasis coefficient h n p was calculated according to equation log y log c 1 h log x where y is n p ratio in charophytes thalli x is n p ratio in resources and c is constant sterner and elser 2002 calculations were performed based on dissolved forms in the surrounding environment since only those can be taken up by macrophytes reynolds and davies 2001 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions following the application of iron sulphate significant changes were observed only in some of the parameters from among the entire analysed set most notably slight acidification of water and ec increase ensued in both treatments table 1 the coagulant caused complete elimination of phosphates in the water an effect which was sustained almost until the end of the experiment in the final week the concentration increased to the level observed in control impact of the coagulant on the concentrations of mineral nitrogen forms was not determined as their level remained stable and within similar values in all chambers analysis demonstrated increased concentration of ca ions in the low treatment whereas in the high treatment chambers the concentration remained at a level similar to control no differences of the kind were observed with respect to mg application of the coagulant resulted in a substantial increase of fe concentrations over 10 fold for the low dosage and over 25 fold for the high dosage in comparison with control the concentrations would decrease over time approaching control values at the end of experiment sulphate ions were added along with the coagulant but significant concentration increases of the latter were determined only in the low treatment chamber compared to control in the high treatment sulphate concentration did not diverge much from control application of the coagulant also affected light availability due to deterioration of physical properties in the low treatment water colour increased to 324 4 mg pt dm 3 mean stand dev and reached 582 4 mg pt dm 3 in the high treatment vs 32 4 mg pt dm 3 in control analogous outcomes were observed with respect to turbidity which increased to 16 9 0 4 ntu in the low treatment and to 35 4 1 5 ntu in the high treatment vs 0 8 0 3 ntu in control increased colour and turbidity had a significant impact on the light extinction coefficient kd par which registered 4 fold increase in the low treatment over 10 fold in the high treatment translating into par reduction by 50 in the low treatment and by 90 in high those severe environmental shifts lasted for 72 h coagulation and flocculation of particles over that period caused the thalli of charophytes to become thoroughly covered with a viscous colloid substance the amount of the suspension was proportional to the dose of iron sulphate the remaining analysed parameters did not display statistically significant differences table 1 3 2 growth of chara hispida specimens of c hispida in the low and high treatments differed considerably in their biometric parameters under the influence of iron sulphate table 2 differences were recorded especially with respect to the length of main axis and the length of branchlets in all nodes in comparison to the control individuals main axis length increased in both treatment modalities but only in the low variant were they statistically significant table 3 as for the length of internode i significant elongation was noted in the low treatment 31 longer than in control marked differences were found in the lengths of internodes ii and iii where the variation in elongation was significant compared to control 42 40 in low and 23 33 in high respectively overall greater elongation of internodes was observed for the low concentration fig 1 with regard to the length of branchlets the reverse was the case greater elongation was noted in the high treatment with the exception of comparable elongation in node i in the low treatment branchlet length in nodes ii and iii increased significantly by approximately 20 and 12 respectively whereas corresponding branchlets in the high were 26 internode ii and 25 internode iii longer than in control fig 1 despite the tendency for the side axes to increase the difference was statistically significant only for the length of the first order side axes between control and the low treatments table 3 in terms of the number of branches there were no significant changes the rgr did not exhibit changes between treatments at tstart charophytes did not show developed oospores and did not form any in the course of the experiment 3 3 chara hispida stoichiometric thalli concentrations of the analysed elements were characterized by relatively high stability changes were observed in p and fe concentration simultaneously demonstrating significance of the entire model table 2 c content in the thalli did not differ statistically between treatment modalities registering approximate values of 220 mg g 1 d w n concentration was slightly increased only in the low treatment with no significant difference with respect to control p concentrations displayed statistical differences between the low treatment where a drop by ca 35 0 7 mg g 1 d w occurred and control and the high treatment approx 1 0 mg g 1 d w in the high modality p concentration was only 10 lower than in control fig 2 despite sulphate supplementation as component part of the coagulant s content in the thalli was constant within a range approaching 4 5 mg s g 1 d w in contrast to s concentration fe ions in the thalli from the chambers with iron sulphate addition increased significantly in the low treatment fe concentration was over 10 fold higher than in control 0 14 mg g 1 d w and in the high treatment it increased to 2 3 mg g 1 d w fig 2 the c n p ratio for c hispida thalli in the control treatment was 530 16 1 mol mol 1 and did not deviate much from the high treatment 556 17 1 mol mol 1 in the low treatment however it increased to 800 24 1 mol mol 1 average c n ratio increased in the low treatment to 34 1 mol mol 1 and differed significantly from control c n 31 mol mol 1 p 0 01 as well as high treatment c n 32 1 mol mol 1 p 0 05 pronounced changes were observed with respect to c p which increased in the low dosage to 805 1 mol mol 1 thus differing significantly from control 539 1 mol mol 1 and the high dosage 558 1 mol mol 1 p 0 05 the n p ratio in the control and high chambers was respectively 17 1 and 18 1 mol mol 1 whereas in the low treatment chambers it reached 25 1 mol mol 1 in all treatments n p content in c hispida increased as the water n p concentration increased the value of stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients h n p for the control treatment was 2 9 while in the low and high treatments h n p 0 9 however it was significant only for the low treatment also results of multiple comparisons among the groups showed differences between low and the other treatment modalities table 4 4 discussion the addition of iron sulphate resulted in several physicochemical changes in the abiotic environment both iron treatments caused significant changes but their intensity was dose dependent the first disturbances to occur in the habitat were decrease in water ph as well as increase in water colour and turbidity acidification changed the environmental conditions preferred by charophytes completely which in the context of chemical methods used in lake restoration represents an important and serious problem if charophyte communities are involved immers et al 2013 rybak et al 2017b the relatively rapid neutralisation of acidity was due to the dissolution of charophyte encrustation calcium and or magnesium carbonate with ca and mg ions being released into the water encrustation may constitute over 70 of dry biomass pełechaty et al 2013 therefore its dissolution causes disturbances in the calcium magnesium equilibrium resulting in calcification problems affecting metabolism and morphology as well gomes and asaeda 2010 rybak et al 2019 siong and asaeda 2009 in this study lower ca concentration in the high treatment was associated with so4 and as the caso4 solubility equilibrium has been exceeded it resulted in hard soluble salt precipitation this outcome was observed in charophyte meadows where dissolution of ca encrustation was accompanied by high sulphate supply rybak et al 2019 alkalinisation was supported by the photosynthetic process through depletion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen carbonate ions smith and bidwell 1989 it should be emphasised that this process took place in a limited space dominated by charophytes neutralisation of acidity in a water body with a large pelagic area may not be as effective and in the long term it can lead to the transformation of a given habitat iron sulphate accomplished the primary goal of its application as it completely eliminated phosphates from the water column orihel et al 2016 zamparas et al 2012 and produced a lasting effect phosphate concentration increased to the level observed in the control chambers only in the final week of the experiment that increase owed to natural fluctuations of nutrient concentration following seasonal temperature drop autumn and decelerated charophyte metabolism in colder periods nutrient uptake is suppressed in those plants thus their concentration in water increases aerts and chapin 1999 coagulant application did not affect concentration of nitrogen forms which should be attributed to the chemical properties of coagulants another adversely affected factor was light availability which is crucial for charophyte growth kufel and kufel 2002 rip et al 2007 over a short term iron sulphate caused increase of water colour and turbidity as well as reduction in par availability simultaneously iron phosphate complexation processes occurred leading subsequently to precipitation flocculation and sedimentation of aggregates flocs pizarro et al 1995 which formed a sticky dark brown sediment layer on the charophytes it significantly reduced the amount of light penetrating into the charophyte thalli in the long term in such conditions despite improved light transparency in the water column charophytes were exposed to the stress of shading immers et al 2013 rybak et al 2017a the plants phenotype is regulated by environmental and genetic factors but phenotypic plasticity is considered an adaptive trait of plants enabling them to deal with abiotic environmental variables cronin and lodge 2003 harvell 1990 three types of behavioural reactions were observed with respect to charophyte meadows as modes of responding to changes in environmental conditions 1 intensification the growth of the main axis 2 increased growth rate of the branchlets and 3 increased growth rate of the first order side axes while the first reaction is common and consists in rapid elongation towards the water surface blindow et al 2003 blindow and schütte 2007 the subsequent are at odds with the typical defence mechanism against light limitation as expected c hispida intensified its growth towards the water surface to compensate for the negative effects of shading such a response occurs in a situation of severe limitation of sunlight availability due to changes in the optical characteristics of water or intensive growth of neighbouring individuals leading to a higher density of population blindow and schütte 2007 charophytes are characterized by apical growth followed by differentiation into nodes and internodes thus the upper internodal cells do not usually reach their maximal size piazza et al 2005 torn et al 2006 decreasing light availability resulted in greater internode lengths which may be perceived as an adaptive response whereby the branchlet rosette is repositioned closer to water surface where light intensity is greater this may explain more substantial elongation of the internodes ii and iii in all treatments internode i was significantly elongated only in the low treatment in which the algae were subject to less stress at the same time the length of the main axis in the high treatment was inhibited compared to the low treatment such reactions should be interpreted as the effect of excessive stress in the high treatment this had been confirmed in laboratory conditions where c hispida exposed to the same iron concentrations displayed inhibited growth rate and oospore production rybak et al 2017a these individuals despite the mobilization of reserves to achieve fast elongation had to allocate some of them to survival in adverse environmental conditions kozłowski 1992 in this study the changes in algae structure intensive growth branching were not directly reflected in increased organic matter being indicative of redirected resource allocation rather than synthesis of new molecules as regards the dimensions of branchlets the study showed a significant increase in the length of branchlets in both iron treatments a branchlet rosette can constitute the main assimilation area therefore extension of this area is a desirable feature in adverse light conditions middelboe and markager 1997 owens et al 2008 moreover high concentration of photosynthetic pigments in the apical parts caused photosynthetic activity to be highest in these particular regions in c hispida andrews et al 1984 however branchlets in the lower nodes tend to be longer and almost horizontally oriented which increases their photosynthetic efficiency as well schneider et al 2015 here the increase in branchlets was most evident in the high iron treatments suggesting that the energy investment to promote development of branchlet rosettes and thus augment the assimilation area was decidedly higher than in elongation towards light this may indicate that an enlarged assimilation area may be an alternative defence mechanism against light limitation additionally an increase in the surface area of individual specimens followed the elongation of existing side axis a mechanism also observed in a laboratory experiment in which c hispida was exposed to iron sulphate rybak et al 2017a in this study the first order side axes were elongated only in the low treatment which could be interpreted as a response to the maximal shading level consisting in full allocation of energy to vegetative growth under the strongest stimulus no significant branch elongation was noted this means that the strength of stress stimulus in the low treatment triggered the most comprehensive response to shading on the other hand that growth tendency of the side axes coupled with their greater number enhances disintegration capacity this is connected with the production of new small sized individuals of bociąg and rekowska 2012 which will have a chance to change their ecological niche e g move to shallower better illuminated waters where their development would be ensured behavioural changes owing to environmental disturbances were accompanied by shifting c n p stoichiometry and fe concentrations in c hispida it may be noted however that application of iron sulphate and considerable increase of water sulphate concentration did not affect s concentration in the thalli demonstrating that those ions were not accumulated by c hispida in any case high sulphate concentration represents a hazard to organisms only in anaerobic conditions when sulphates are reduced to toxic sulphides van der welle et al 2007 the risk is therefore negligible in the well oxygenated charophytes communities kufel and kufel 2002 the c n p ratio in the control treatment was higher than in other submersed macrophytes demars and edwards 2008 fernández aláez et al 1999 but it was still similar to the ratio described previously for c hispida puche and rodrigo 2015 rojo et al 2017 these results are coherent with earlier findings indicating that charophytes contain less n and p than angiosperms wang et al 2018 xing et al 2013b higher c p and n p ratios observed in this study were most likely caused by low phosphorous levels submerged macrophytes may be impacted by environmental conditions such as water and sediment nutrient concentrations water depth and light availability jackson et al 1991 xing et al 2013b yuan et al 2017 while investigations to date suggest that inconsistent stoichiometry of individuals depends largely on species variation broadley et al 2004 demars and edwards 2008 li et al 2015 the environment which they inhabit plays a major role in their elemental composition lacoul and freedman 2006 thalli c was unaffected by phosphates and light limitation caused by coagulant application nonetheless low light intensity and lack of bioavailable phosphates resulted in lower p concentration in thalli and higher c n c p and n p ratios though only in the low treatment in both treatments carbon exhibited stable concentration and remained unrelated to n or p concentration changes indicating that the structural role of c was independent from the biochemical roles played by these nutrients demars and edwards 2007 the study also demonstrated relatively high stability of n concentrations although it needs to be noted that it was not a limiting factor and its bioavailable forms were present in the water throughout the experiment at the same time the slightly elevated c n ratio may have been due to cells intensive development and insufficient n uptake process at this growth rate this resulted in n dilution in thalli a slight decreased in its concentration and an increased in relation to c viaroli et al 2005 moreover the elevated c n ratio may result not only from the nitrogen dilution but also from the accumulation of carbonaceous compatible solutes the latter provide energy reserves protect cells against environmental stress and are expended when biomass reaches a certain critical level welsh 2000 on the other hand p concentration decreased significantly in the plants subjected to the low treatment rapid growth of the main axis side axes and the development of branchlets in the conditions of phosphate ion shortage led to the dilution of p accumulated in the thalli vegetal growth is inhibited in infertile environments mainly by external n and p availability therefore rapid growth of plants due to low light stress dilutes n and p concentrations in plant tissues and in consequence cause higher c n and c p ratios cronin and lodge 2003 li et al 2013 yan et al 2006 it is perfectly logical to assume that autotrophs growth requires proteins n based which are integral to p based rrna and atp conley et al 2009 demars and edwards 2008 previous studies discussing the mechanism of tissue dilution were concerned exclusively with vascular plants in which resources were allocated to the stem often at the expense of roots or leaves fu et al 2012 strand and weisner 2001 our study demonstrates that the mechanism also functions in stoneworts which as thallophytes do not possess developed tissues or conducting structures absorbing all necessary elements solely from water gąbka 2009 application of iron sulphate resulted in a substantial increase of fe concentration in the water which in turn affected the amount of fe accumulated in the thalli however fe content determined in this study cannot be easily confronted with the results of other investigations due to lack of findings relating to charophytes various forms of available iron different fe concentrations in the medium and different times of exposure see xing et al 2013a at the same time addition of 25 100 g m 2 fe does not affect growth and development of such macrophytes as elodea nuttallii stuckenia pectinata potamogeton acutifolius stratiotes aloides myriophyllum aquaticum and chara virgata bakker et al 2016 and cited there absence of signs of inhibited development surface reduction of the branchlets necrotic spots on leaves or disturbed formation of new branchlets indicate non toxic impact of iron immers et al 2013 van der welle et al 2007 also presence of fe in the control samples rules out iron limitation this is a frequently observed phenomenon in lakes with carbonate rich bottom sediments where precipitation of iron from carbonates is a significant regulator of macroalgal development rozan et al 2002 the indirect effect of iron described above increase of colour turbidity and formation of sediment on the thalli proves more harmful than its potential toxic effect in the cells ecological stoichiometry denotes the capacity of an organism to maintain constant elemental composition and ratios irrespective of environmental fluctuation of such elements sterner and elser 2002 as well as reflects physiological and biochemical adaptation of the organism to the surrounding environment hessen et al 2004 the capacity for regulation depends on the limitation of resources physiological constraints and growth rate potential sistla et al 2015 the available studies of aquatic plants demonstrate their potent ability for stoichiometric regulation demars and edwards 2007 li et al 2015 however this experiment shows that individual stoichiometric traits may vary within one species depending on the environmental resources c hispida individuals from the control chambers were characterized by relatively strong homeostasis which was nevertheless retained in a narrow range of n p concentrations and with a phosphate concentration that was low in any case application of iron salts caused the thalli to be shaded and eliminated phosphates inducing a behavioural change and as h n p indicates disrupting homeostasis in charophytes sterner and elser 2002 the strongest response of c hispida observed in the low treatment caused the most extensive homeostatic disturbance that owed primarily to the decreased p concentration in the thalli this should be attributed to the high costs of maintaining growth or proliferation rate under stress which manifests in diminished homeostasis boersma and kreutzer 2002 nevertheless such a result would validate the hypothesis that stoichiometric homeostasis is an approximate rather than precise value because organisms have to respond constantly to the changing availability of resources wang et al 2012 it has to be stressed therefore that biogeochemical pathways and homeostatic control are mechanisms in which nutrient shifts regulate trophodynamic structure glibert 2012 disturbances in such processes especially sudden ones e g application of iron sulphate may hinder the community s ability to return to its original state even when the disruptive factors are eliminated this is accounted for by the alternate stable state theory which posits that a system maintains stability until environmental changes or disturbances occur scheffer and carpenter 2003 consequently not only eutrophication su et al 2019 but also re oligotrophication processes destabilize ecosystems by inhibiting homeostatic macrophyte communities therefore the response of the community to environmental shift changes in the relative composition of nutrients ecological stoichiometry and the resulting hysteresis which supersedes previous homeostasis are critical factors affecting its further existence when such community is exposed to chemical restoration procedures 5 conclusions behaviour of c hispida suggests that rapid elongation towards water surface is not the only mechanism against shading the alternative consists in an augmentation of the assimilation area through branchlets and side axis elongation stronger response in charophytes subjected to 10 8 g fe m 2 indicates that the 21 6 g fe m 2 led to excessive stress which reduced the amount of energy allocated to growth intensified growth disturbed elemental stoichiometry and homeostasis but only phosphorus was diluted in the growing thalli due to the limited availability of that element nevertheless the restoration induced stoichiometric imbalance is a dangerous process and may destabilize the community functioning neither 10 8 g fe m 2 nor 21 6 g fe m 2 in form of iron sulphate caused the community of c hispida to disappear the obtained findings may contribute to better understanding and development of restoration methods based on phosphorus inactivation as such they carry considerable practical relevance for lake management in light of increasing eutrophication declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

18128,evapotranspiration is an important aspect of the hydrological cycle in natural landscapes in cities evapotranspiration is typically limited by reduced vegetation and extensive impervious surfaces stormwater control measures scms seek among other objectives to move the urban hydrological cycle towards pre development conditions promoting processes such as infiltration and evapotranspiration yet evapotranspiration is generally assumed to play a minor role in the water balance of stormwater control measures since established urban trees can use large quantities of water their inclusion with stormwater control measures could potentially substantially increase evapotranspiration we installed infiltration trenches alongside established lophostemon confertus trees in the grassed verges of a typical suburban street to assess 1 whether redirecting stormwater to trees could increase their transpiration and 2 the contribution of transpiration to the water balance of stormwater control measures we measured stormwater retention and transpiration for two spring summer periods and estimated an annual water balance for the infiltration trenches although redirecting stormwater to trees did not increase their transpiration these trees did use large volumes of water up to 96 l d 1 corresponding to 3 4 mm d 1 per projected canopy area annually stormwater retention was 24 of runoff and tree transpiration was equivalent to 17 of runoff our results suggest that streetscapes fitted with tree based stormwater control measures could increase the volumetric reduction of stormwater runoff by increasing the proportion of evapotranspiration in the water balance since public space is highly contested in cities and increasing canopy cover is a priority for many planners integrating trees with stormwater control measures could provide dual benefits for a single management intervention enabling a greater number of distributed stormwater control measures with smaller impervious catchments in the streetscape graphical abstract image 1 keywords wsud lid water balance sap flow urban bioretention 1 introduction in natural ecosystems infiltration and evapotranspiration of rainfall are large components of the hydrological cycle in urban landscapes extensive impervious surfaces and densification disrupt infiltration and evapotranspiration instead large volumes of rainfall are converted to stormwater runoff causing flash flooding and degradation of urban waterways hatt et al 2004 walsh et al 2005 stormwater control measures scms seek to emulate pre development hydrological processes by reducing and slowing stormwater runoff through a combination of detention infiltration and retention paule mercado et al 2017 walsh et al 2015 biofilters and raingardens are commonly used scms that intercept runoff near its source encouraging infiltration and evapotranspiration of stormwater flows so that urban hydrological processes and the water balance are closer to their pre development conditions burns et al 2012 eckart et al 2018 while impervious surfaces can create large volumes of stormwater runoff they simultaneously reduce water availability for urban vegetation such as street trees the reduction in infiltration beneath impervious surfaces combined with limited rooting volumes soil compaction and high evaporative demand in cities means street trees are likely to experience drought stress martin et al 2016 mullaney et al 2015 which could reduce the valuable ecosystem services that trees provide thom et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a recognition of the ecosystem services that trees provide in cities including urban cooling pollution reduction biodiversity habitat and stormwater reduction has motivated municipalities to increase tree canopy cover cameron and blanuša 2016 ordóñez et al 2019 in the context of existing drought stress however which is likely to be exacerbated by warmer drier climates under predicted climate change scenarios hoegh guldberg et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b such efforts may be unsuccessful if trees do not have adequate soil moisture gebert et al 2019 widney et al 2016 to address the challenge of vegetation drought stress and excessive stormwater runoff concurrently researchers and practitioners are increasingly advocating the use of stormwater as a resource to passively irrigate vegetation in cities berland et al 2017 fenner 2017 scharenbroch et al 2016 trees have the capacity to make use of large volumes of water through transpiration and therefore could improve the retention capacity of stormwater control measures nocco et al 2016 szota et al 2017 trees have been shown to use large volumes of water in cities litvak et al 2012 pataki et al 2011 wang et al 2012 in temperate beijing wang et al 2012 measured maximum transpiration of 44 l day 1 for aesculus chinensis trees even higher maximum water use was measured by litvak et al 2012 in arid los angeles ranging from 70 to 250 l d 1 depending on species however few studies to date have measured transpiration from trees passively irrigated by stormwater control measures scharenbroch et al 2016 tirpak et al 2019 hence our understanding of the volume of water that trees could transpire from scms and therefore their potential to increase volumetric retention of stormwater is limited vegetation is generally considered to play a minor role in the water balance of small scale scms such as bioretention systems and therefore contribute little to the removal of stormwater inflows evapotranspiration from bioretention systems planted with sedges or rushes is typically 1 5 of stormwater runoff daly et al 2012 gao et al 2018 hoskins and peterein 2013 this is primarily because bioretention systems are generally small relative to the connected impervious catchment that drains into them payne et al 2015 so evapotranspiration is a small proportion of the large volumes of stormwater runoff generated de macedo et al 2019 grey et al 2018 for example braswell et al 2018 estimated transpiration as the residual of inflows and outflows in a small tree based scm calculating a mean contribution of 0 7 grey et al 2018 modelled transpiration from reference evapotranspiration estimating a higher contribution from establishing trees of up to 2 8 both these studies had small scms and tree canopy relative to the impervious catchment area which meant the volume of stormwater runoff far exceeded transpiration conversely scharenbroch et al 2016 suggested trees could play a much greater role in the water balance estimating that trees could transpire up to 58 of stormwater runoff in bioswales fitted with an outlet control structure when transpiration is high relative to the runoff received and retained by an scm evapotranspiration can play a greater role in the water balance of scms established urban street trees have large projected canopy areas that may exceed the surface area of scms so even if transpiration rates are similar to other vegetation types szota et al 2018 tirpak et al 2019 or young trees they have the potential to transpire from a greater area than ground level vegetation types planted into scms therefore berland et al 2017 suggests trees can provide greater stormwater reduction than other vegetation because of the discrepancy between the size of the projected canopy and the footprint of a tree at ground level large projected canopy area means trees could have greater runoff reduction efficiency for a small ground level footprint relative to the ground level footprint of other vegetation types hence establishing trees with smaller canopy areas could contribute less tirpak et al 2019 to the proportion of stormwater runoff transpired from scms than large established trees litvak et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge the contribution of established tree transpiration to the water balance of scms has not been reported despite their potential there remains a limited understanding of the potential contribution of established trees to the water balance of scms and the co benefits of integrating scms and trees such as increased transpiration and reduced runoff from the street berland et al 2017 scharenbroch et al 2016 therefore the primary aims of this study were to determine 1 whether redirecting stormwater to established trees could increase their transpiration and 2 the potential contribution of transpiration to the water balance of stormwater control measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design to assess the influence of scms on transpiration and the contribution of transpiration to the water balance we installed 6 m2 unlined infiltration trenches sized from 2 4 to 4 6 of the connected impervious catchment in the grassed verges of a low density residential street in melbourne australia fig 1 melbourne has a temperate climate peel et al 2007 with mean annual temperature of 19 8 c 1971 2019 and mean annual rainfall of 708 mm 1950 2019 rainfall is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year with long term means ranging from 43 3 to 69 0 mm per month lowest rainfall generally occurs from january to march bom 2019 nine established lophostemon confertus trees broadleaf evergreen were selected for the study based on similarity in size and connected impervious catchment area table 1 trees were allocated to one of three treatments 1 tree with no adjacent infiltration trench control 2 tree with an adjacent infiltration trench receiving stormwater through a vertical grated inlet lintel and 3 tree with an adjacent infiltration trench receiving stormwater through a horizontal grated inlet pit fig 1 illustrates a cross section of trench dimensions and spacing relative to the trees for further detail on the installation of infiltration trenches and technical details of the inlet designs see szota et al 2019 2 2 meteorological conditions meteorological conditions were monitored from october 2014 to april 2016 fig 2 two automatic weather stations were installed at each end of the street which measured solar radiation sp212 apogee instruments logan usa wind speed 014a met one campbell scientific garbutt australia and air temperature and relative humidity hmp155a vaisala melbourne australia at 30 min intervals measurements from each station were averaged and used to calculate mean daily vapour pressure deficit d and mean daily penman monteith reference evapotranspiration et o allen et al 1998 rainfall data from a rain gauge located 1 7 km from the study site were supplied by melbourne water station oakleigh south and aggregated into rainfall events using the hydromad package andrews et al 2011 in r 3 4 2 r core team 2017 events were distinguished by at least 6 hr without rainfall fig 2 shows environmental conditions throughout the study 2 3 stormwater runoff and retention rainfall that generates stormwater runoff at this site effective rainfall was estimated by subtracting an initial loss of 0 5 mm from each rainfall event as calculated by szota et al 2019 total stormwater runoff q runoff m3 was then estimated for each event by multiplying effective rainfall by the impervious catchment area m2 feeding into each infiltration trench we assumed the grassed verge did not generate runoff because topsoil saturated hydraulic conductivity as measured at the site was 46 5 mm hr 1and the maximum rainfall intensity during the study was 13 2 mm hr 1 while runoff from saturation excess may occur when the permeable upper layers are full this would be infrequent in this region hill et al 1996 to determine stormwater retention q retention odyssey water level sensors 0 5 m dataflow systems ltd christchurch nz were installed in each infiltration trench to measure depth of water mm at 6 min intervals stormwater retention m3 was then calculated as the sum of positive changes in water level taking substrate porosity into account during a stormwater runoff event multiplied by the surface area of the trench 1 q r e t e n t i o n s a t r e n c h δ w l p where sa trench is the surface area of the trench 6 m2 fig 1 δ wl is positive changes in water level during a stormwater event and p is the porosity of gravel in the trench infiltration trenches did not have an overflow outlet so all retained stormwater was assumed to exfiltrate into surrounding soil once trenches were full stormwater runoff could not enter the inlet and therefore bypassed as discharge to stormwater networks 2 4 soil moisture two soil moisture sensors odyssey multi profile soil moisture dataflow systems ltd christchurch nz were installed 1 m from the base either side of each study tree parallel to the road soil moisture was monitored at 5 depths 300 500 700 900 and 1100 mm below the surface representing the total stored water in the soil profile 200 1200 mm average volumetric water content vwc was calculated for each depth class and averaged across the profile to get mean daily vwc we used soil moisture data from the sensor located between the tree and infiltration trench the second sensor was used to estimate soil moisture during periods when the first sensor had missing or sporadic data capture during winter 2015 sensors were affected by preferential flow of water down the access tube causing malfunction resulting in six weeks of missing data fig 3 2 5 transpiration transpiration was estimated from sap flow sensors sfm1 ict international utilising the heat ratio method measured at two depths after burgess et al 2001 two sap flow sensors were installed on the east and west side of each tree approximately 1 2 m from the ground during october to march late spring to early autumn from 2014 to 2016 sap flux cm3 cm 2 hr 1 was calculated using a constant thermal diffusivity burgess et al 2001 and specific sapwood properties sapwood area wood density and moisture content determined from tree cores 5 mm diameter collected in april 2016 data were corrected for an average wounding diameter of 1 8 mm to correct for probe misalignment climate data were filtered to identify periods where sap flux should equal zero as described in pfautsch et al 2010 and all data were linearly offset accordingly where a sensor thermistor failed raw data from the opposite sensor was used to estimate sap flux from measured wood

estimate transpiration e c mm east and west sap flow data were averaged and divided by projected canopy area m2 for each study tree table 1 2 6 predicting annual transpiration since sap flow data were not available from april to september 2015 we estimated daily transpiration from environmental variables for each tree adjacent to an scm pit and lintel treatments estimated and measured transpiration were then combined to calculate an annual water balance for 2015 we assessed the relationship between transpiration and mean daily climate variables air temperature vapour pressure deficit solar radiation and reference evapotranspiration mean daily soil moisture 0 1200 mm profile and mean daily water level for all scm trees we compared all plausible combinations of these variables excluding combinations of correlated variables to select the model which explained the greatest variance in transpiration with the least explanatory variables both adjusted r2 and akaike information criterion aic were used to select the best model for predicting transpiration the model with high r2 and low aic was deemed most suitable 2 7 the potential annual water balance to assess the potential contribution of transpiration to the annual water balance of scms adjacent to established trees we calculated a modified water balance for 2015 the complete water balance is defined by eger et al 2017 as 2 r p q e t i δ s where r is runoff from the impervious catchment area p is direct precipitation on all surfaces in the catchment q is discharge to stormwater networks et is evapotranspiration which includes transpiration from plants and evaporation from surfaces i is infiltration and δ s is the change in stored water in our study we define a modified water balance relative to the impervious catchment only that does not include p on the grassed verge nor i from direct precipitation further evaporation from surfaces grassed verge tree canopy were not measured so et is comprised of tree transpiration only therefore the modified water balance was calculated as 3 q r u n o f f q b y p a s s q t r a n s p i r a t i o n δ s where q runoff is the stormwater runoff generated by

0 7 to 6 2 mm d 1 per projected canopy area fig 3a c equivalent to 10 8 to 96 1 l d 1 mean daily soil moisture ranged from 12 7 to 31 9 fig 3d and mean daily water level retained at the catchment scale ranged from 0 03 to 4 3 mm d 1 fig 3e we assessed the difference in treatment means for transpiration soil moisture and stormwater retention to evaluate whether redirecting stormwater to trees could increase transpiration on average trees transpired 3 5 mm d 1 fig 4 a with no significant difference in transpiration per projected canopy area between treatments p 0 86 mean daily soil moisture was 20 8 fig 4b with no significant difference between treatments p 0 19 there was large variation in the soil moisture of control trees driven by a single replicate fig 4e which meant that soil moisture was often higher than lintel and pit treatments during the study fig 3d mean stormwater retention per rainfall event was equivalent to 30 of runoff on average fig 4c and did not differ significantly between treatments p 0 7 3 2 predicting transpiration for calculation of an annual water balance to evaluate the potential contribution of transpiration to the 2015 water balance daily transpiration was modelled between april and september as sap flow was not measured in these months transpiration was positively correlated with natural log transformed reference evapotranspiration solar radiation and vapour pressure deficit fig 5 a c both air temperature and soil moisture fig 5d e were weakly related to transpiration p 0 05 r2 0 05 and there was no significant relationship between daily transpiration and mean daily water level in the trench on the same day fig 5f since reference evapotranspiration had the highest r2 and is calculated from other correlated climate variables we predicted transpiration from reference evapotranspiration for each tree which explained 82 of the variance in transpiration figure s1b 3 3 the contribution of transpiration to the annual water balance to assess the potential contribution of transpiration to the annual water balance of our scms we calculated transpiration q transpiration as a proportion of impervious catchment runoff q runoff the residual difference between stormwater retention q retention and transpiration was assumed to contribute to a change in soil water content δs overall transpiration was equivalent to 17 of total stormwater runoff generated by the connected impervious catchment in 2015 stormwater retention was 24 which exceeded transpiration overall therefore on an annual basis the potential change in stored water was equivalent to 7 of total runoff fig 6 the partitioning of the water balance varied throughout the year during warmer months october march when transpiration was high q transpiration 6 79 was equivalent to or exceeded q retention 10 40 so the soil was often a source of water to trees rather than a sink for stormwater fig 7 a during cooler months april september q transpiration was generally less then q retention because reference evapotranspiration was low during this period so the soil was a sink for stormwater fig 7a cumulatively q transpiration decreased from 22 of q runoff in warmer months to 12 of q runoff in cooler months conversely q retention increased from 20 in warmer months to 28 in cooler months therefore q transpiration exceeded q retention in warmer months while the reverse was true in cooler months 4 discussion 4 1 does redirecting stormwater to established trees increase transpiration our hypothesis that redirecting stormwater to established trees could increase transpiration relied on the assumption that these trees had limited access to water and are often drought stressed however there was no significant difference in mean transpiration per projected canopy area 3 5 mm d 1 between scm and control trees as such there was limited evidence to support our hypothesis we suggest that redirecting stormwater did not increase transpiration in our study because trees already had access to enough water in the streetscape mean daily soil moisture in the roadside verge was 20 8 and did not differ between treatments despite particularly high soil moisture for one control tree the relationship between mean daily transpiration and soil moisture was weak and there was no significant relationship between mean daily transpiration and water level within infiltration trenches supporting our suggestion that water was not limiting in this study further leaf water potential measurements demonstrated that these trees were not drought stressed throughout the two year study szota et al 2019 high variability in soil moisture within our street road verges highlights the inherent heterogeneity of soil properties and soil moisture availability within urban landscapes ossola and livesley 2016 many potential water sources exist within the urban landscape such as leaky pipes bonneau et al 2018 or verge irrigation marshall et al 2019 large established trees have been shown to extend roots toward such wet zones östberg et al 2012 čermák et al 2000 assuming that all urban trees are water limited may therefore be an oversimplification of the complex heterogeneity that exists in urban landscapes installing scms in dense urban areas that have less permeable surfaces and obvious limited soil moisture vegetation drought stress or hotter and drier climates may result in a greater positive influence on the transpiration of adjacent trees additionally installing scms with large storage detention zones and slower infiltration rates could extend the length of time water is available to adjacent trees or contribute to greater soil moisture recharge which can support the water requirements of trees beyond the immediate rainfall event symes and connellan 2013 4 2 the contribution of transpiration to the water balance although we could not conclude that redirecting stormwater to trees increased transpiration our data shows that established trees can use large volumes of water which could improve the volume reduction efficiency of scms nocco et al 2016 in our study established trees used up to 96 l d 1 in line with other studies on urban tree water use for a range of species and climates čermák et al 2000 litvak et al 2012 wang et al 2012 over a year established tree transpiration was equivalent to 17 of total runoff from a 198 m2 connected impervious catchment hence evapotranspiration from scms sized from 2 4 to 4 6 of the connected impervious catchment in our study was much greater than is generally reported for small scale scms 1 5 of the connected impervious catchment such as biofiltration systems which is generally less than 5 of stormwater runoff brown and hunt 2011 daly et al 2012 winston et al 2016 established trees have the potential to transpire a much larger proportion of stormwater runoff in the water balance compared with standard biofiltration systems increasing evapotranspiration toward pre development proportions and reducing runoff volumes we suggest this is due to several factors including 1 projected canopy area 2 connected impervious catchment area 3 system design and 4 rainfall distribution mean transpiration rates per projected canopy area of established trees in this study 3 5 mm d 1 were within the range previously reported for scms 2 7 7 7 mm d 1 planted with a variety of vegetation types denich and bradford 2010 tirpak et al 2019 wadzuk et al 2015 the key difference is that per unit scm surface area trees are much more efficient for example while established trees in our study transpired up to 6 2 mm d 1 per projected canopy area 13 m2 transpiration per scm area 6 m2 was equivalent to 13 4 mm d 1 therefore a tree based scm could be much more efficient than an equivalent scm planted with sedges or rushes because the canopy area providing the transpiration pathway in the water balance extends beyond the scm footprint at ground level berland et al 2017 high transpiration rates relative to the scm surface area could markedly increase volumetric reduction efficiency of scms by creating greater storage capacity between rainfall events nocco et al 2016 szota et al 2017 while species differences would play a major role in transpiration rates particularly during drought szota et al 2018 and recovery from water deficit brodribb and mcadam 2013 we propose projected canopy area would be an important point of difference between trees and other vegetation types influencing the proportion of stormwater runoff that could be transpired from scms of course trees grow over time so smaller trees would transpire less runoff initially when their projected canopy area is less than or equivalent to the scm footprint at ground level grey et al 2018 estimated evapotranspiration of young trees with a projected canopy area equal to the scm footprint 0 72 m2 in a dense streetscape was up to 2 8 of total runoff in line with standard biofiltration estimates brown and hunt 2011 daly et al 2012 winston et al 2016 however as trees mature extending their canopy area beyond the scm volumetric transpiration and therefore volumetric reduction efficiency could increase we therefore suggest that tree based scms be designed to target a projected canopy area at maturity relative to the connected impervious catchment in combination with appropriate scm to catchment ratios so that system retention and storage capacity can be matched with the potential water requirements of the mature canopy the surface area of small scms such as raingardens and biofiltration systems tends to be much smaller than the catchment payne et al 2015 meaning they receive very large volumes of stormwater runoff gao et al 2018 hoskins and peterein 2013 and rendering the volume transpired comparatively small braswell et al 2018 grey et al 2018 since smaller catchments will generate lower runoff volumes a greater proportion of that runoff could be transpired for the same projected canopy area in our study scms were spaced approximately three residential frontages apart corresponding to a 198 m2 connected impervious catchment area on average the projected canopy area of scm trees 13 m2 was therefore equivalent to 7 of the catchment if scms had been installed outside each house the projected canopy area would be equivalent to 19 of the catchment 70 m2 so transpiration could be equivalent to 50 of generated runoff if the tree transpired an average of 3 mm m 2 of projected canopy d 1 throughout the year therefore the volume of runoff a given canopy receives at ground level will markedly influence the potential contribution of transpiration to the water balance in our study rainfall was particularly low during march 2015 resulting in minimal stormwater runoff from the catchment as such transpiration was 79 of total runoff emphasizing how the volume of runoff affects the relative proportion of flows that are transpired increasingly studies have emphasised the role that evapotranspiration can play in the water balance of small scale scms such as green roofs or biofiltration systems a summary of evapotranspiration from scms was conducted by eger et al 2017 and ebrahimian et al 2019 who suggest 20 80 of the water balance can be evapotranspired however these studies often have small or no connected impervious catchment areas hess et al 2017 nocco et al 2016 to increase volume reduction efficiency of tree based scms compared with standard bioretention systems we suggest that smaller connected impervious catchments combined with larger projected tree canopy could be considered thus increasing the proportion of runoff that is transpired this greater scm efficiency could also be achieved through a narrow but continuous scm trench that provides supplementary soil moisture to all the trees planted within the street tree plantings could include a combination of large mature trees or shrubs and other vegetation to maximise the projected canopy area transpiring from the scm however if catchment sizes are decreased larger storage volumes may be required to ensure the water requirements of trees are met the potential of established trees to transpire runoff retained by adjacent scms assumes the scms function efficiently and do not block or restrict water inflow in our study a large proportion of runoff 76 bypassed the scms due to issues with inlet design transmission efficiency and blockages szota et al 2019 these complications limited stormwater inflow and therefore retention which meant that tree transpiration often exceeded runoff retention during summer months improving inlet efficiency could enable scms to meet water requirements of trees even during periods of high transpiration in addition to supplementing water requirements of adjacent trees unlined scms can contribute to recharging soil moisture when runoff retention exceeds transpiration in cooler months building up soil moisture storage in cooler months when tree water requirements are lower also referred to as soil water banking symes and connellan 2013 could support higher tree transpiration in subsequent spring and summer months especially for cities with reduced spring summer rainfall the variation in water balance partitioning at both the annual and monthly scales will be further affected by the distribution of rainfall and leaf phenology for deciduous trees the contribution would be considerably lower or close to zero during winter months harper et al 2015 contributing to greater soil water banking or groundwater recharge hence the potential contribution of transpiration to the water balance reported here would vary for similarly sized trees in cities with different rainfall distributions hotter and drier climates that have greater reference evapotranspiration or for deciduous trees 5 conclusions evapotranspiration from scms is increasingly recognised as an important aspect of the water balance but is a small part relative to the large volume of stormwater runoff generated by connected impervious catchments we found that established urban trees retrofitted with infiltration trenches transpired large volumes of water equivalent to 17 of annual runoff generated established trees have the potential to transpire a greater proportion of runoff from small scms than other vegetation types because their transpiring canopy area typically extends beyond the surface area of an scm at ground level to maximise the proportion of stormwater transpired from a street planners could create minimum projected canopy area to impervious catchment ratios for scms a combination of smaller impervious catchment areas and large established trees could increase the volumetric reduction of stormwater runoff in a street while we could not conclude that redirecting stormwater to trees through scms increases transpiration rates of established trees in this study we have shown that the large volume of annual transpiration means integrating trees with scms has the potential to markedly increase the proportion of evapotranspiration in the water balance of scms and therefore volumetric reduction of stormwater runoff since public space is highly contested in cities and increasing canopy cover is a priority of many planners integrating trees into scms could provide dual benefits for a single management intervention and enable a greater number of distributed stormwater control measures with smaller impervious catchments in the streetscape improving

18128,evapotranspiration is an important aspect of the hydrological cycle in natural landscapes in cities evapotranspiration is typically limited by reduced vegetation and extensive impervious surfaces stormwater control measures scms seek among other objectives to move the urban hydrological cycle towards pre development conditions promoting processes such as infiltration and evapotranspiration yet evapotranspiration is generally assumed to play a minor role in the water balance of stormwater control measures since established urban trees can use large quantities of water their inclusion with stormwater control measures could potentially substantially increase evapotranspiration we installed infiltration trenches alongside established lophostemon confertus trees in the grassed verges of a typical suburban street to assess 1 whether redirecting stormwater to trees could increase their transpiration and 2 the contribution of transpiration to the water balance of stormwater control measures we measured stormwater retention and transpiration for two spring summer periods and estimated an annual water balance for the infiltration trenches although redirecting stormwater to trees did not increase their transpiration these trees did use large volumes of water up to 96 l d 1 corresponding to 3 4 mm d 1 per projected canopy area annually stormwater retention was 24 of runoff and tree transpiration was equivalent to 17 of runoff our results suggest that streetscapes fitted with tree based stormwater control measures could increase the volumetric reduction of stormwater runoff by increasing the proportion of evapotranspiration in the water balance since public space is highly contested in cities and increasing canopy cover is a priority for many planners integrating trees with stormwater control measures could provide dual benefits for a single management intervention enabling a greater number of distributed stormwater control measures with smaller impervious catchments in the streetscape graphical abstract image 1 keywords wsud lid water balance sap flow urban bioretention 1 introduction in natural ecosystems infiltration and evapotranspiration of rainfall are large components of the hydrological cycle in urban landscapes extensive impervious surfaces and densification disrupt infiltration and evapotranspiration instead large volumes of rainfall are converted to stormwater runoff causing flash flooding and degradation of urban waterways hatt et al 2004 walsh et al 2005 stormwater control measures scms seek to emulate pre development hydrological processes by reducing and slowing stormwater runoff through a combination of detention infiltration and retention paule mercado et al 2017 walsh et al 2015 biofilters and raingardens are commonly used scms that intercept runoff near its source encouraging infiltration and evapotranspiration of stormwater flows so that urban hydrological processes and the water balance are closer to their pre development conditions burns et al 2012 eckart et al 2018 while impervious surfaces can create large volumes of stormwater runoff they simultaneously reduce water availability for urban vegetation such as street trees the reduction in infiltration beneath impervious surfaces combined with limited rooting volumes soil compaction and high evaporative demand in cities means street trees are likely to experience drought stress martin et al 2016 mullaney et al 2015 which could reduce the valuable ecosystem services that trees provide thom et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a recognition of the ecosystem services that trees provide in cities including urban cooling pollution reduction biodiversity habitat and stormwater reduction has motivated municipalities to increase tree canopy cover cameron and blanuša 2016 ordóñez et al 2019 in the context of existing drought stress however which is likely to be exacerbated by warmer drier climates under predicted climate change scenarios hoegh guldberg et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b such efforts may be unsuccessful if trees do not have adequate soil moisture gebert et al 2019 widney et al 2016 to address the challenge of vegetation drought stress and excessive stormwater runoff concurrently researchers and practitioners are increasingly advocating the use of stormwater as a resource to passively irrigate vegetation in cities berland et al 2017 fenner 2017 scharenbroch et al 2016 trees have the capacity to make use of large volumes of water through transpiration and therefore could improve the retention capacity of stormwater control measures nocco et al 2016 szota et al 2017 trees have been shown to use large volumes of water in cities litvak et al 2012 pataki et al 2011 wang et al 2012 in temperate beijing wang et al 2012 measured maximum transpiration of 44 l day 1 for aesculus chinensis trees even higher maximum water use was measured by litvak et al 2012 in arid los angeles ranging from 70 to 250 l d 1 depending on species however few studies to date have measured transpiration from trees passively irrigated by stormwater control measures scharenbroch et al 2016 tirpak et al 2019 hence our understanding of the volume of water that trees could transpire from scms and therefore their potential to increase volumetric retention of stormwater is limited vegetation is generally considered to play a minor role in the water balance of small scale scms such as bioretention systems and therefore contribute little to the removal of stormwater inflows evapotranspiration from bioretention systems planted with sedges or rushes is typically 1 5 of stormwater runoff daly et al 2012 gao et al 2018 hoskins and peterein 2013 this is primarily because bioretention systems are generally small relative to the connected impervious catchment that drains into them payne et al 2015 so evapotranspiration is a small proportion of the large volumes of stormwater runoff generated de macedo et al 2019 grey et al 2018 for example braswell et al 2018 estimated transpiration as the residual of inflows and outflows in a small tree based scm calculating a mean contribution of 0 7 grey et al 2018 modelled transpiration from reference evapotranspiration estimating a higher contribution from establishing trees of up to 2 8 both these studies had small scms and tree canopy relative to the impervious catchment area which meant the volume of stormwater runoff far exceeded transpiration conversely scharenbroch et al 2016 suggested trees could play a much greater role in the water balance estimating that trees could transpire up to 58 of stormwater runoff in bioswales fitted with an outlet control structure when transpiration is high relative to the runoff received and retained by an scm evapotranspiration can play a greater role in the water balance of scms established urban street trees have large projected canopy areas that may exceed the surface area of scms so even if transpiration rates are similar to other vegetation types szota et al 2018 tirpak et al 2019 or young trees they have the potential to transpire from a greater area than ground level vegetation types planted into scms therefore berland et al 2017 suggests trees can provide greater stormwater reduction than other vegetation because of the discrepancy between the size of the projected canopy and the footprint of a tree at ground level large projected canopy area means trees could have greater runoff reduction efficiency for a small ground level footprint relative to the ground level footprint of other vegetation types hence establishing trees with smaller canopy areas could contribute less tirpak et al 2019 to the proportion of stormwater runoff transpired from scms than large established trees litvak et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge the contribution of established tree transpiration to the water balance of scms has not been reported despite their potential there remains a limited understanding of the potential contribution of established trees to the water balance of scms and the co benefits of integrating scms and trees such as increased transpiration and reduced runoff from the street berland et al 2017 scharenbroch et al 2016 therefore the primary aims of this study were to determine 1 whether redirecting stormwater to established trees could increase their transpiration and 2 the potential contribution of transpiration to the water balance of stormwater control measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design to assess the influence of scms on transpiration and the contribution of transpiration to the water balance we installed 6 m2 unlined infiltration trenches sized from 2 4 to 4 6 of the connected impervious catchment in the grassed verges of a low density residential street in melbourne australia fig 1 melbourne has a temperate climate peel et al 2007 with mean annual temperature of 19 8 c 1971 2019 and mean annual rainfall of 708 mm 1950 2019 rainfall is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year with long term means ranging from 43 3 to 69 0 mm per month lowest rainfall generally occurs from january to march bom 2019 nine established lophostemon confertus trees broadleaf evergreen were selected for the study based on similarity in size and connected impervious catchment area table 1 trees were allocated to one of three treatments 1 tree with no adjacent infiltration trench control 2 tree with an adjacent infiltration trench receiving stormwater through a vertical grated inlet lintel and 3 tree with an adjacent infiltration trench receiving stormwater through a horizontal grated inlet pit fig 1 illustrates a cross section of trench dimensions and spacing relative to the trees for further detail on the installation of infiltration trenches and technical details of the inlet designs see szota et al 2019 2 2 meteorological conditions meteorological conditions were monitored from october 2014 to april 2016 fig 2 two automatic weather stations were installed at each end of the street which measured solar radiation sp212 apogee instruments logan usa wind speed 014a met one campbell scientific garbutt australia and air temperature and relative humidity hmp155a vaisala melbourne australia at 30 min intervals measurements from each station were averaged and used to calculate mean daily vapour pressure deficit d and mean daily penman monteith reference evapotranspiration et o allen et al 1998 rainfall data from a rain gauge located 1 7 km from the study site were supplied by melbourne water station oakleigh south and aggregated into rainfall events using the hydromad package andrews et al 2011 in r 3 4 2 r core team 2017 events were distinguished by at least 6 hr without rainfall fig 2 shows environmental conditions throughout the study 2 3 stormwater runoff and retention rainfall that generates stormwater runoff at this site effective rainfall was estimated by subtracting an initial loss of 0 5 mm from each rainfall event as calculated by szota et al 2019 total stormwater runoff q runoff m3 was then estimated for each event by multiplying effective rainfall by the impervious catchment area m2 feeding into each infiltration trench we assumed the grassed verge did not generate runoff because topsoil saturated hydraulic conductivity as measured at the site was 46 5 mm hr 1and the maximum rainfall intensity during the study was 13 2 mm hr 1 while runoff from saturation excess may occur when the permeable upper layers are full this would be infrequent in this region hill et al 1996 to determine stormwater retention q retention odyssey water level sensors 0 5 m dataflow systems ltd christchurch nz were installed in each infiltration trench to measure depth of water mm at 6 min intervals stormwater retention m3 was then calculated as the sum of positive changes in water level taking substrate porosity into account during a stormwater runoff event multiplied by the surface area of the trench 1 q r e t e n t i o n s a t r e n c h δ w l p where sa trench is the surface area of the trench 6 m2 fig 1 δ wl is positive changes in water level during a stormwater event and p is the porosity of gravel in the trench infiltration trenches did not have an overflow outlet so all retained stormwater was assumed to exfiltrate into surrounding soil once trenches were full stormwater runoff could not enter the inlet and therefore bypassed as discharge to stormwater networks 2 4 soil moisture two soil moisture sensors odyssey multi profile soil moisture dataflow systems ltd christchurch nz were installed 1 m from the base either side of each study tree parallel to the road soil moisture was monitored at 5 depths 300 500 700 900 and 1100 mm below the surface representing the total stored water in the soil profile 200 1200 mm average volumetric water content vwc was calculated for each depth class and averaged across the profile to get mean daily vwc we used soil moisture data from the sensor located between the tree and infiltration trench the second sensor was used to estimate soil moisture during periods when the first sensor had missing or sporadic data capture during winter 2015 sensors were affected by preferential flow of water down the access tube causing malfunction resulting in six weeks of missing data fig 3 2 5 transpiration transpiration was estimated from sap flow sensors sfm1 ict international utilising the heat ratio method measured at two depths after burgess et al 2001 two sap flow sensors were installed on the east and west side of each tree approximately 1 2 m from the ground during october to march late spring to early autumn from 2014 to 2016 sap flux cm3 cm 2 hr 1 was calculated using a constant thermal diffusivity burgess et al 2001 and specific sapwood properties sapwood area wood density and moisture content determined from tree cores 5 mm diameter collected in april 2016 data were corrected for an average wounding diameter of 1 8 mm to correct for probe misalignment climate data were filtered to identify periods where sap flux should equal zero as described in pfautsch et al 2010 and all data were linearly offset accordingly where a sensor thermistor failed raw data from the opposite sensor was used to estimate sap flux from measured wood properties during that period sap flux was then multiplied by the cross sectional area of sapwood surrounding each measurement depth hatton et al 1990 to determine whole tree water use sap flow l to estimate transpiration e c mm east and west sap flow data were averaged and divided by projected canopy area m2 for each study tree table 1 2 6 predicting annual transpiration since sap flow data were not available from april to september 2015 we estimated daily transpiration from environmental variables for each tree adjacent to an scm pit and lintel treatments estimated and measured transpiration were then combined to calculate an annual water balance for 2015 we assessed the relationship between transpiration and mean daily climate variables air temperature vapour pressure deficit solar radiation and reference evapotranspiration mean daily soil moisture 0 1200 mm profile and mean daily water level for all scm trees we compared all plausible combinations of these variables excluding combinations of correlated variables to select the model which explained the greatest variance in transpiration with the least explanatory variables both adjusted r2 and akaike information criterion aic were used to select the best model for predicting transpiration the model with high r2 and low aic was deemed most suitable 2 7 the potential annual water balance to assess the potential contribution of transpiration to the annual water balance of scms adjacent to established trees we calculated a modified water balance for 2015 the complete water balance is defined by eger et al 2017 as 2 r p q e t i δ s where r is runoff from the impervious catchment area p is direct precipitation on all surfaces in the catchment q is discharge to stormwater networks et is evapotranspiration which includes transpiration from plants and evaporation from surfaces i is infiltration and δ s is the change in stored water in our study we define a modified water balance relative to the impervious catchment only that does not include p on the grassed verge nor i from direct precipitation further evaporation from surfaces grassed verge tree canopy were not measured so et is comprised

was 20 8 fig 4b with no significant difference between treatments p 0 19 there was large variation in the soil moisture of control trees driven by a single replicate fig 4e which meant that soil moisture was often higher than lintel and pit treatments during the study fig 3d mean stormwater retention per rainfall event was equivalent to 30 of runoff on average fig 4c and did not differ significantly between treatments p 0 7 3 2 predicting transpiration for calculation of an annual water balance to evaluate the potential contribution of transpiration to the 2015 water balance daily transpiration was modelled between april and september as sap flow was not measured in these months transpiration was positively correlated with natural log transformed reference evapotranspiration solar radiation and vapour pressure deficit fig 5 a c both air temperature and soil moisture fig 5d e were weakly related to transpiration p 0 05 r2 0 05 and there was no significant relationship between daily transpiration and mean daily water level in the trench on the same day fig 5f since reference evapotranspiration had the highest r2 and is calculated from other correlated climate variables we predicted transpiration from reference evapotranspiration for each tree which explained 82 of the variance in transpiration figure s1b 3 3 the contribution of transpiration to the annual water balance to assess the potential contribution of transpiration to the annual water balance of our scms we calculated transpiration q transpiration as a proportion of impervious catchment runoff q runoff the residual difference between stormwater retention q retention and transpiration was assumed to contribute to a change in soil water content δs overall transpiration was equivalent to 17 of total stormwater runoff generated by the connected impervious catchment in 2015 stormwater retention was 24 which exceeded transpiration overall therefore on an annual basis the potential change in stored water was equivalent to 7 of total runoff fig 6 the partitioning of the water balance varied throughout the year during warmer months october march when transpiration was high q transpiration 6 79 was equivalent to or exceeded q retention 10 40 so the soil was often a source of water to trees rather than a sink for stormwater fig 7 a during cooler months april september q transpiration was generally less then q retention because reference evapotranspiration was low during this period so the soil was a sink for stormwater fig 7a cumulatively q transpiration decreased from 22 of q runoff in warmer months to 12 of q runoff in cooler months conversely q retention increased from 20 in warmer months to 28 in cooler months therefore q transpiration exceeded q retention in warmer months while the reverse was true in cooler months 4 discussion 4 1 does redirecting stormwater to established trees increase transpiration our hypothesis that redirecting stormwater to established trees could increase transpiration relied on the assumption that these trees had limited access to water and are often drought stressed however there was no significant difference in mean transpiration per projected canopy area 3 5 mm d 1 between scm and control trees as such there was limited evidence to support our hypothesis we suggest that redirecting stormwater did not increase transpiration in our study because trees already had access to enough water in the streetscape mean daily soil moisture in the roadside verge was 20 8 and did not differ between treatments despite particularly high soil moisture for one control tree the relationship between mean daily transpiration and soil moisture was weak and there was no significant relationship between mean daily transpiration and water level within infiltration trenches supporting our suggestion that water was not limiting in this study further leaf water potential measurements demonstrated that these trees were not drought stressed throughout the two year study szota et al 2019 high variability in soil moisture within our street road verges highlights the inherent heterogeneity of soil properties and soil moisture availability within urban landscapes ossola and livesley 2016 many potential water sources exist within the urban landscape such as leaky pipes bonneau et al 2018 or verge irrigation marshall et al 2019 large established trees have been shown to extend roots toward such wet zones östberg et al 2012 čermák et al 2000 assuming that all urban trees are water limited may therefore be an oversimplification of the complex heterogeneity that exists in urban landscapes installing scms in dense urban areas that have less permeable surfaces and obvious limited soil moisture vegetation drought stress or hotter and drier climates may result in a greater positive influence on the transpiration of adjacent trees additionally installing scms with large storage detention zones and slower infiltration rates could extend the length of time water is available to adjacent trees or contribute to greater soil moisture recharge which can support the water requirements of trees beyond the immediate rainfall event symes and connellan 2013 4 2 the contribution of transpiration to the water balance although we could not conclude that redirecting stormwater to trees increased transpiration our data shows that established trees can use large volumes of water which could improve the volume reduction efficiency of scms nocco et al 2016 in our study established trees used up to 96 l d 1 in line with other studies on urban tree water use for a range of species and climates čermák et al 2000 litvak et al 2012 wang et al 2012 over a year established tree transpiration was equivalent to 17 of total runoff from a 198 m2 connected impervious catchment hence evapotranspiration from scms sized from 2 4 to 4 6 of the connected impervious catchment in our study was much greater than is generally reported for small scale scms 1 5 of the connected impervious catchment such as biofiltration systems which is generally less than 5 of stormwater runoff brown and hunt 2011 daly et al 2012 winston et al 2016 established trees have the potential to transpire a much larger proportion of stormwater runoff in the water balance compared with standard biofiltration systems increasing evapotranspiration toward pre development proportions and reducing runoff volumes we suggest this is due to several factors including 1 projected canopy area 2 connected impervious catchment area 3 system design and 4 rainfall distribution mean transpiration rates per projected canopy area of established trees in this study 3 5 mm d 1 were within the range previously reported for scms 2 7 7 7 mm d 1 planted with a variety of vegetation types denich and bradford 2010 tirpak et al 2019 wadzuk et al 2015 the key difference is that per unit scm surface area trees are much more efficient for example while established trees in our study transpired up to 6 2 mm d 1 per projected canopy area 13 m2 transpiration per scm area 6 m2 was equivalent to 13 4 mm d 1 therefore a tree based scm could be much more efficient than an equivalent scm planted with sedges or rushes because the canopy area providing the transpiration pathway in the water balance extends beyond the scm footprint at ground level berland et al 2017 high transpiration rates relative to the scm surface area could markedly increase volumetric reduction efficiency of scms by creating greater storage capacity between rainfall events nocco et al 2016 szota et al 2017 while species differences would play a major role in transpiration rates particularly during drought szota et al 2018 and recovery from water deficit brodribb and mcadam 2013 we propose projected canopy area would be an important point of difference between trees and other vegetation types influencing the proportion of stormwater runoff that could be transpired from scms of course trees grow over time so smaller trees would transpire less runoff initially when their projected canopy area is less than or equivalent to the scm footprint at ground level grey et al 2018 estimated evapotranspiration of young trees with a projected canopy area equal to the scm footprint 0 72 m2 in a dense streetscape was up to 2 8 of total runoff in line with standard biofiltration estimates brown and hunt 2011 daly et al 2012 winston et al 2016 however as trees mature extending their canopy area beyond the scm volumetric transpiration and therefore volumetric reduction efficiency could increase we therefore suggest that tree based scms be designed to target a projected canopy area at maturity relative to the connected impervious catchment in combination with appropriate scm to catchment ratios so that system retention and storage capacity can be matched with the potential water requirements of the mature canopy the surface area of small scms such as raingardens and biofiltration systems tends to be much smaller than the catchment payne et al 2015 meaning they receive very large volumes of stormwater runoff gao et al 2018 hoskins and peterein 2013 and rendering the volume transpired comparatively small braswell et al 2018 grey et al 2018 since smaller catchments will generate lower runoff volumes a greater proportion of that runoff could be transpired for the same projected canopy area in our study scms were spaced approximately three residential frontages apart corresponding to a 198 m2 connected impervious catchment area on average the projected canopy area of scm trees 13 m2 was therefore equivalent to 7 of the catchment if scms had been installed outside each house the projected canopy area would be equivalent to 19 of the catchment 70 m2 so transpiration could be equivalent to 50 of generated runoff if the tree transpired an average of 3 mm m 2 of projected canopy d 1 throughout the year therefore the volume of runoff a given canopy receives at ground level will markedly influence the potential contribution of transpiration to the water balance in our study rainfall was particularly low during march 2015 resulting in minimal stormwater runoff from the catchment as such transpiration was 79 of total runoff emphasizing how the volume of runoff affects the relative proportion of flows that are transpired increasingly studies have emphasised the role that evapotranspiration can play in the water balance of small scale scms such as green roofs or biofiltration systems a summary of evapotranspiration from scms was conducted by eger et al 2017 and ebrahimian et al 2019 who suggest 20 80 of the water balance can be evapotranspired however these studies often have small or no connected impervious catchment areas hess et al 2017 nocco et al 2016 to increase volume reduction efficiency of tree based scms compared with standard bioretention systems we suggest that smaller connected impervious catchments combined with larger projected tree canopy could be considered thus increasing the proportion of runoff that is transpired this greater scm efficiency could also be achieved through a narrow but continuous scm trench that provides supplementary soil moisture to all the trees planted within the street tree plantings could include a combination of large mature trees or shrubs and other vegetation to maximise the projected canopy area transpiring from the scm however if catchment sizes are decreased larger storage volumes may be required to ensure the water requirements of trees are met the potential of established trees to transpire runoff retained by adjacent scms assumes the scms function efficiently and do not block or restrict water inflow in our study a large proportion of runoff 76 bypassed the scms due to issues with inlet design transmission efficiency and blockages szota et al 2019 these complications limited stormwater inflow and therefore retention which meant that tree transpiration often exceeded runoff retention during summer months improving inlet efficiency could enable scms to meet water requirements of trees even during periods of high transpiration in addition to supplementing water requirements of adjacent trees unlined scms can contribute to recharging soil moisture when runoff retention exceeds transpiration in cooler months building up soil moisture storage in cooler months when tree water requirements are lower also referred to as soil water banking symes and connellan 2013 could support higher tree transpiration in subsequent spring and summer months especially for cities with reduced spring summer rainfall the variation in water balance partitioning at both the annual and monthly scales will be further affected by the distribution of rainfall and leaf phenology for deciduous trees the contribution would be considerably lower or close to zero during winter months harper et al 2015 contributing to greater soil water banking or groundwater recharge hence the potential contribution of transpiration to the water balance reported here would vary for similarly sized trees in cities with different rainfall distributions hotter and drier climates that have greater reference evapotranspiration or for deciduous trees 5 conclusions evapotranspiration from scms is increasingly recognised as an important aspect of the water balance but is a small part relative to the large volume of stormwater runoff generated by connected impervious catchments we found that established urban trees retrofitted with infiltration trenches transpired large volumes of water equivalent to 17 of annual runoff generated established trees have the potential to transpire a greater proportion of runoff from small scms than other vegetation types because their transpiring canopy area typically extends beyond the surface area of an scm at ground level to maximise the proportion of stormwater transpired from a street planners could create minimum projected canopy area to impervious catchment ratios for scms a combination of smaller impervious catchment areas and large established trees could increase the volumetric reduction of stormwater runoff in a street while we could not conclude that redirecting stormwater to trees through scms increases transpiration rates of established trees in this study we have shown that the large volume of annual transpiration means integrating trees with scms has the potential to markedly increase the proportion of evapotranspiration in the water balance of scms and therefore volumetric reduction of stormwater runoff since public space is highly contested in cities and increasing canopy cover is a priority of many planners integrating trees into scms could provide dual benefits for a single management intervention and enable a greater number of distributed stormwater control measures with smaller impervious catchments in the streetscape improving

18129,full scale aerobic granular sludge technology under the trade name nereda has been implemented for municipal as well as industrial wastewater treatment owing to the operational reactor procedures two types of waste aerobic granular sludge can be clearly distinguished 1 aerobic granular sludge selection discharge ags sd and 2 aerobic granular sludge mixture ags rtc this study systematically compared the anaerobic biodegradability of ags sd and ags rtc under mesophilic conditions results were further compared with the anaerobic conversion of waste activated sludge was as well as primary sludge ps from full scale municipal wastewater treatment plants analysis showed similar chemical characteristics for ags sd and ps which were both characterized by a high carbohydrate content 429 21 and 464 15 mg glucose g vs sludge respectively mainly cellulosic fibres concurrently ags rtc exhibited chemical properties close to was both characterized by a relatively high protein

remarkably higher than that of ags rtc and was strikingly the bmp of ags rtc 194 10 ml ch4 g vs substrate was significantly lower than that of was 232 11 ml ch4 g vs substrate mechanically destroying the compact structure of ags rtc only accelerated the methane production rate but did not significantly affect the bmp value results indicated that compared to was the proteins and carbohydrates in ags rtc were both more resistant to anaerobic bio degradation which might be related to the presence of refractory microbial metabolic products in ags rtc graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochemical methane potential full scale nereda municipal wastewater treatment plant waste aerobic granular sludge aerobic granular sludge selection discharge physicochemical characteristics 1 introduction conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment systems cas have been widely applied in the treatment of many types of wastewater for decades however large quantities of waste sludge i e primary ps and waste activated sludge was are being produced during this process which is regarded problematic owing to its environmental risk and high cost for treatment and disposal appels et al 2008 a relatively new biological treatment for wastewater is the aerobic granular sludge ags or nereda technology which is applied at full scale since 2005 giesen et al 2013 currently there are over than 70 nereda wastewater treatment plants in operation or under construction worldwide https www royalhaskoningdhv com nereda it s main advantages i e a smaller process footprint quicker sludge settling and reduced energy demand resulted in a rapid market acceptance from promising innovation to a mature technology capable of competing with established conventional wastewater treatment technologies de kreuk et al 2007 pronk et al 2015 the biomass yield represented by the mass of sludge produced over the mass of organic matter cod or bod consumed appears to be similar for aerobic granules and activated sludge as given the same conditions nancharaiah and reddy 2018 as granular sludge processes are typically operated at relatively long solid retention times srts the sludge production of this process would be lower than that of cas in this sense however the waste sludge of ags installations is not yet separately processed with the increasing number and size of nereda installations strategies for the efficient management of generated waste sludge from ags systems wags are required anaerobic digestion ad has been commonly used in the treatment of ps and was with the purpose of organics reduction and energy recovery in the form of biogas similarly ad is a potential option for wags treatment however to our best knowledge the anaerobic digestion of wags has been limitedly studied bengtsson et al 2018 the anaerobic biodegradability of wags with large granules larger than 1 6 mm has been investigated in batch and continuous ad systems bernat et al 2017 del rio et al 2011 del rio et al 2014 palmeiro sanchez et al 2013 most studies merely reported the biochemical methane potential bmp in ml ch4 per g vs substrate of wags but lack information on hydrolysis rate coefficients or degradation efficiencies of its key organic fractions therefore a direct comparison of the biodegradation kinetics of wags with the better understood was degradation is not yet possible furthermore the bmp results of wags are often inconsistent between studies which can be attributed to the highly biodegradable often synthetic or industrial influent used to grow these granules in a well controlled laboratory or pilot scale system the operational conditions of ags systems and its feeding characteristics significantly influence the physiochemical and morphological properties of wags and thus may affect their degradation behaviour in ad bernat et al 2017 de kreuk et al 2010 so far the granular sludge based nereda technology has been mainly applied in municipal wastewater treatment https www royalhaskoningdhv com nereda municipal wastewater typically has a much lower chemical oxygen demand cod concentration than industrial wastewater and has more complex substrates and a higher suspended solids concentration than synthetic influent used in laboratory experiments moy et al 2002 therefore there is a great interest about the actual anaerobic biodegradability of the wags produced in full scale ags systems treating municipal sewage two types of wags can be distinguished 1 sludge that is removed every cycle which we call the aerobic granular sludge selection discharge or selection spill ags sd this is the more flocculent sludge with a lower settling velocity than the aerobic granules by removing this sludge a biological selection pressure is applied towards faster settling granules because it is removed every cycle this waste aerobic granular sludge has had a lower retention time than the granules ali et al 2019 2 the excess granular sludge that originates from biomass growth and that is removed to avoid too high biomass concentrations in the reactor the so called solid retention time control of the ags ags rtc therefore this study systematically assessed 1 the characteristics and anaerobic biodegradability of ags sd and ags rtc as well as 2 the differences in physicochemical property and biodegradability of these fractions with ps and was bmp tests were conducted under mesophilic conditions to compare solids reduction methane yield hydrolysis rate coefficient as well as the biodegradability of carbohydrates proteins lipids and lignocelluloses in all types of sludge these results lead to an improved understanding of the biodegradation of wags in ad and are helpful to design and effectively operate ad systems for wags treatment at full scale implementations 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum ags sd and ags rtc were collected from a full scale municipal wastewater fed nereda system garmerwolde the netherlands which has a treatment capactity of 91 583 population equivalent p e at the time when both types of sludge were sampled the nereda reactor was operated with a process cycles of approximately 6 h 4 h of aeration 1 h of settling 1 h of anaerobic feeding simultaneous effluent withdrawal and 15 min of excess sludge discharge the excess sludge was stored in a sludge buffer tank before being transported to the on site sludge treatment facilities ags rtc was withdrawn at the end of the aeration phase under fully mixed conditions whereas ags sd was collected from the sludge buffer tank wastewater treatment plant wwtp garmerwolde has 6 mm screens followed by grit removal where after the influent is stored for 3 4 h in a mixed influent buffer there is no primary settler pronk et al 2015 and the influent from the buffer tank is directly fed to the nereda tanks was and anaerobic inoculum were sampled from an enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr activated sludge tank under fully aerated and mixed conditions and an anaerobic sludge digester at wwtp harnaschpolder den hoorn the netherlands respectively the latter wwtp is designed for a 1 3 million p e

used as model substrate for the positive control of the bmp tests wastewater characteristics and operational parameters of both wwtps are shown in table 1 2 2 anaerobic batch bmp test batch bmp tests of sludge were conducted in quadruplicates by using an automated methane potential test system ampts bioprocess control sweden with 500 ml serum bottles one of the serum bottles was sacrificed for vfa concentration measurements the recipes and dosages for phosphorus buffer solution macronutrients and trace elements were according to zhang et al 2014 the volume of the mixture of inoculum and substrate was 300 ml the ratio of vs g of inoculum to vs g of substrate was 2 in the batch bottles vs concentrations of different types of sludge were manipulated by centrifugation 5 min at 3 500 g in order to explain whether the morphology of the sludge affect the biodegradability the structures of ags rtc and was were destroyed by crushing the sludge with a household blender hr2052 90 philips the

analysed by a gas chromatography gc with a flame ionization detector fid agilent 7890a usa the gc was equipped with an agilent 19091f 112 column of 25 m 320 μm 0 5 μm and helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 8 ml min injection temperature was 240 c and oven temperature was 80 c the lignocellulosic fibres content in sludge samples was determined by van soest method van soest 1963 the particle size distribution psd of ags rtc was analysed by a sieving method pronk et al 2015 whereas the psds of the other sludge types including the crushed sludge were measured with a particle size analyser bluewave microtrac germany a digital microscope vhx 6000 keyence belgium with a universal zoom lens from 20 to 200 vh z20ur keyence belgium was used to identify the morphology of the sludge principal component analysis pca for investigating the difference in digestibility between sludges was performed by matlab r2016b mathworks usa for the statistical analysis the student s t test for two groups of samples and one way anova for multiple groups of samples were both applied with spss statistics 25 ibm usa to evaluate the significance of differences in bmps and chemical characteristics between sludges the significance level of probability p value was 0 05 in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge characteristics particle size distribution of each type of sludge was measured to identify the physical difference between the types of sludge fig 1 it is found that the ags rtc sample was dominated by particle sizes larger than 500 μm i e 90 of the total particles which was clearly different from the other sludge samples on the contrary ags sd was composed of particle sizes below 500 μm and therefore showed great similarity with the particle size of was this observed difference in morphology agrees with the results observed by pronk et al 2015 in addition a small fraction of particles in the 500 2000 μm range was observed in ps likely resulting from settling in the primary sedimentation tank the distribution of biochemical components of each sludge sample is presented in table 2 the vs concentrations of all sludge types were adjusted to about 5 by centrifugation in order to minimize the effect of different substrate concentrations in vs on their methane potential wang et al 2015 the used vs concentration is similar to the 3 6 wt range that is usually fed to full scale digesters wwtp harnaschpolder the netherlands however the original vs concentrations of sludge extracted from the different flows were different namely 0 9 0 02 0 4 0 01 0 6 0 01 and 3 3 0 03 wt for ags rtc ags sd was and ps respectively key organic fractions analysed were protein carbohydrates lipids and vfas since they are considered as the most pertinent indicators in assessing and predicting the anaerobic biodegradability of sewage sludge mixtures del rio et al 2011 mottet et al 2010 results show that proteins and carbohydrates predominated in all types of sludge representing in total 58 73 of the organic matter table 2 which are within the typical range reported for sewage sludge del rio et al 2011 gonzalez et al 2018 however the ratio of proteins and carbohydrates differed both ags sd and ps showed a much lower protein carbohydrates ratio than ags rtc and was ags sd contained a similar carbohydrate content as ps which was almost double the carbohydrate content in ags rtc and was the protein content in ags sd was slightly higher than that in ps but still about 30 lower than that in ags rtc and was a large protein fraction in both ags rtc and was was expected since these sludges are mainly composed of cells exo enzymes and microbial metabolic products adav et al 2008 gonzalez et al 2018 different studies also reported that the proteins carbohydrates ratio of the extracellular polymeric structures for ags was usually higher than that for as mcswain et al 2005 zhu et al 2015 which is in line with our findings table 2 the high content of carbohydrates and the deviating proteins carbohydrates ratio of ags sd indicates that this sludge fraction is considerably different from the ags rtc with big granules it is known that in contrast to as ps is rich in fibres and contains much less microbial related organics resulting in the high carbohydrates fraction in this type of sludge bernat et al 2017 the high abundance of fibres in ags sd has been observed before pronk et al 2015 and agrees with the analyses performed in this study fig 2 c and d to verify the fibrous content and composition cellulose hemicellulose and lignin contents in all sludge samples were determined fig 3 the used van soest method was originally developed for the assessment of fibre rich materials of plant origin therefore when the van soest method is applied for sewage sludge characterization the resulting fractions are commonly referred to as like fractions mottet et al 2010 wu et al 2015 fig 3 shows that the content of lignin like and hemicellulose like fractions was approximately 9 and 15 of the vs on average respectively similar for all sludge samples the concentration of the cellulose like fibres in ags sd and ps was similar i e 15 and 18 of the total vs on average respectively this was almost twice the value in ags rtc and was which was 7 and 9 of the total vs on average respectively the result was supported by the microscopic examinations presented in fig 2 confirming that this organic fraction is one of major components of carbohydrates in ags sd it needs to be mentioned that the sum of hemicellulose and cellulose in the was and ags rtc fractions was larger than the total carbohydrates measured fig 3 and table 2 even though these two fractions are part of the total carbohydrate fraction this could be caused by the interference of sludge components and the detergents used in the van soest method for example divalent cations from the sludge matrix could form complexes with the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta used in the hemicellulose extraction step resulting in an overestimation of the hemicellulose content mottet et al 2010 indicated that the colorimetric method for direct carbohydrates determination showed a higher reliability than the van soest fractionation therefore the fibre fractionation in this study should only be used as an indicator of the differences between the sludge types rather than a measure of the actual carbohydrate concentration cellulose embodies between 30 and 50 of the suspended solids in the wastewater of western countries stowa 2010 in conventional sewage treatment cellulose is partly removed in the primary clarifier being included in the ps champagne and li 2009 as is shown in this study as well cellulose entering the activated sludge tanks will be partly degraded ahmed et al 2019 the nereda plant at garmerwolde receives raw sewage without primary clarification it is hypothesized that the large suspended solids like the observed fibres are not likely to interact with the fully developed compact granules and thus will stay part of the more flocculent fraction that is often observed with the ags matrix pronk et al 2015 as a result sludge stratification takes place during settling phase together with the selection pressure applied in granular sludge systems to retain large granules the non granules fraction including the mentioned cellulose fibers can be washed out during the sludge selection discharge 3 2 methane production and degradation kinetics of sludges in bmp tests the different biomass composition as well as the different degree of stabilization will likely lead to a different extent and rate of anaerobic digestion this assumption was verified in a bmp test of which the results are presented in fig 4 the bmp of the positive control was 357 ml ch4 g vs on average which fulfilled the criteria stated by holliger et al 2016 low amounts of total vfas were detected during the first 6 days of digestion of the four sludge samples with a maximum concentration of 332 355 421 and 402 mg l at day 3 for ags rtc was ags sd and ps respectively the inoculum applied for all batch tests was obtained from the full scale digester at harnaschpolder wwtp treating was and ps and was not specifically adapted to the wags fractions del rio et al 2014 showed that after long term acclimation with ags as sole substrate the main microbial populations presented were still those commonly found in digesters treating waste municipal sewage sludge therefore the inoculum used was considered similarly effective for all sludge samples tested results clearly show the lowest bmp value for ags rtc namely 194 ml ch4 g vs substrate this was significantly lower p value 0 01 than the 243 ml ch4 g vs substrate reported for ags grown in a pilot scale reactor fed with synthetic domestic wastewater del rio et al 2011 it should be noted that the organic loading rate to the nereda in garmerwolde was higher than that of the activated sludge plant i e 0 20 and 0 16 g cod g tss d respectively and the cod content of the ags rtc was somewhat higher than that of the was table 2 nonetheless the bmp value of ags rtc was remarkably lower p value 0 02 than that of was our results agree with those of bernat et al 2017 and suggest an inherently lower anaerobic biodegradability of the aerobic granules compared to activated sludge flocs the methane production curves fig 4 could be well fitted with the two substrate model eq 1 fig 4 dotted line r2 0 99 in all studied cases results suggest that all biomass samples consisted of a specific fraction that was rapidly biodegradable and one that was more slowly biodegradable the estimated values of krapid b0 rapid and kslow b0 slow for all types of sludge are shown in table 3 and demonstrate that ags rtc presented a significantly lower krapid p value 0 002 and kslow p value 0 04 than was this calculation was based on the methane production rate whereas the vfa production was excluded since vfa was detected in the first 6 days the k values do not fully represent the hydrolysis rates however compared to was the assessed vfa values in ags rtc were lower as well so it can be concluded that the ags rtc s hydrolysis rate was lower than that of was the ags rtc used in this study mainly consisted of large granules figs 1 and 2 which limits the surface area to volume ratio since the hydrolysis rate is surface proportional angelidaki and sanders 2004 sanders et al 2000 the overall ags rtc digestibility might be determined by the morphological structure of the granules to clarify the influence of morphology over sludge composition on anaerobic digestion ags rtc and was were both mechanically crushed to destroy the physical structure and to achieve a similar particle size distribution fig 3 results from fig 4 and table 3 show that the bmp of the crushed sludges was similar as the non crushed ones the methane production rate however showed different behaviour for the two sludge types all parameters for was did not change remarkably p value 0 05 by crushing revealing that the digestion of was was not affected by the sludge crushing yet ags rtc showed a significant increase p value 0 005 in methane production rate from the rapid convertible fraction krapid and b0 rapid the values found after crushing of ags rtc even approached the values of the rapid digestible fraction of crushed was kinetics of the slowly biodegradable fraction did not statistically change although a small shift from b0 slow to b0 rapid could be seen table 3 this means that destroying the structure of the aerobic granules and increasing its surface area could indeed accelerate the degradation rate of rapidly degradable organics which was in agreement with the observation found by del rio et al 2014 who applied thermal pretreatment to granules in addition crushing liberated a fraction of slowly degradable organics to be degraded more rapidly it should be noted that the total bmp b0 total of crushed granules was similar to that of the intact ags rtc fig 4 and table 3 indicating that the sludge structure only limits digestion rate but not the overall digestibility the results imply that in practice sludge pretreatment of the ags rtc fraction prior to anaerobic digestion could enhance digester performance the bmp of ags sd was just slightly lower than that of ps and remarkably higher than those of ags rtc p value 0 001 and was p value 0 005 also the methane production rate i e both krapid and kslow of both ags sd and ps were distinctly higher table 3 considering the differences in vfa production in combination with the methane production rate it can be stated that also hydrolysis rates of the ags sd and ps are higher than the hydrolysis rates measured for ags rtc and was our present results confirm the high degree of stabilization of ags rtc and the low stabilization degree of the more flocculent ags sd fraction supporting the speculations that were reported by pronk et al 2015 apparently compared to ags ags sd is characterized by a much lower srt in the nereda tank ali et al 2019 resulting in a much higher bmp it should be mentioned that in this study the tested ags sd was taken from a nereda reactor with an operational cycle of 6 h in total which is a common process setting applied in full scale municipal wastewater fed nereda systems stubbé 2016 however the schedule of the process cycle sometimes changes due to other factors such as the weather condition pronk et al 2015 it is worth to investigate in future studies if changes of operational parameters of the nereda reactor could affect the characteristics and the digestibility of the different wags fractions and its overall digestibility 3 3 degradation of organic components in sludges during bmp tests to further elucidate the differences in anaerobic biodegradation of the different sludge types the main organic fractions in the wet sludge mixtures were analysed at the start and the end of the bmp tests table s in supplementary materials the converted fractions during the bmp test are shown in fig 5 one should take into account that the fractions are presented per 100 g wet sludge mixture with initial sludge mixture vs concentrations around 2 7 wt table s in supplementary materials the sum of the fractions accounts for over 96 of the total measured cod reduction considering that the total cod reduction linked to the inoculum in each sludge mixture was 450 60 mg cod 100 g wet sludge mixture the observed cod reduction was indeed significantly different p value 0 002 between the sludges the result of pca according to the degradation of major organic fractions on cod basis fig s in supplementary materials shows that the first component pc1 was related to protein while the second component pc2 referred to carbohydrates these two fractions accounted for the majority of the organics that were anaerobically degraded in all four types of sludge ags rtc and was as well as ps and ags sd respectively were grouped closer together than the sludges sampled from the nereda reactor and the samples from the activated sludge installation this indicates that the two types of waste ags had distinctive characteristics in digestibility which agrees with the bmp results fig 6 presents the changes in the three fibre fractions in the different sludges during ad more than 80 of the cellulose like compounds was degraded while the degradation efficiency for hemicellulose like compounds approximated amounted only 30 in all sludge samples this is in accordance to the degradability during ad found by mottet et al 2010 which were 83 and 33 respectively it is reasonable to assume that the higher content of cellulose in the ags sd and ps was responsible for the additional methane production hemicellulose has a lower molecular weight than cellulose and branches with short lateral sugar chains which are easily hydrolysable polymers perez et al 2002 the low measured degradation of hemicellulose like fraction could be due to the contaminants such as metal edta complexes formed in the analysis as discussed previously even though the amount of carbohydrates and proteins in ags rtc was higher than in was table 2 the methane production from was was larger than that of ags rtc per g vs fig 4 bernat et al 2017 hypothesized that the higher resistance to biodegradation lignin content could explain the observed lower bmp of ags however in our case the content of lignin fraction in ags rtc and was differed only 2 which fall within the standard deviation fig 5 besides the anaerobic biodegradability of lignin in all samples were similar fig 6 the results hence suggest that the lower digestibility of aerobic granules should be ascribed to the inherent limited degradation efficiency of carbohydrates and proteins rather than the higher lignin content in ags table 2 and figs 3 and 6 the exact reason for the observed difference in biodegradation of carbohydrates and proteins between ags rtc and was remains unclear an important fraction of carbohydrates and proteins in ags rtc and was originates from extra cellular polymeric substances eps chen et al 2007 yuan et al 2014 recent studies demonstrated that the distinguished sludge morphology between ags and as was determined by the chemical and mechanical properties of gel forming eps in the sludge of two felz et al 2019 lin et al 2013 possibly the anaerobic conversion of such polymers in ags rtc differs from that in was however conformation of this hypothesis needs more study 4 conclusions based on the results of this research the following conclusions can be drawn the bmp of ags rtc was only 80 of that of was mechanically destroying the compact structure of ags did not affect its bmp but accelerated the degradation rate of rapidly biodegradable organics and liberated a fraction of slowly biodegradable ones resulting in higher methane production rate the bmp of ags sd was similar to the bmp of ps and 1 5 times higher than that of ags rtc mainly due to the slow settle ability of highly biodegradable cellulose like fibres that end up in ags sd fraction of wags proteins and carbohydrates in ags rtc were more difficult to be degraded than those in was even though the amount of these two fractions was higher in ags rtc this difference was hypothesized to be related to the structural differences of eps between these two biomass morphologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18129,full scale aerobic granular sludge technology under the trade name nereda has been implemented for municipal as well as industrial wastewater treatment owing to the operational reactor procedures two types of waste aerobic granular sludge can be clearly distinguished 1 aerobic granular sludge selection discharge ags sd and 2 aerobic granular sludge mixture ags rtc this study systematically compared the anaerobic biodegradability of ags sd and ags rtc under mesophilic conditions results were further compared with the anaerobic conversion of waste activated sludge was as well as primary sludge ps from full scale municipal wastewater treatment plants analysis showed similar chemical characteristics for ags sd and ps which were both characterized by a high carbohydrate content 429 21 and 464 15 mg glucose g vs sludge respectively mainly cellulosic fibres concurrently ags rtc exhibited chemical properties close to was both characterized by a relatively high protein content which were individually 498 14 and 389 15 mg g vs sludge ags sd was characterized by a high biochemical methane potential bmp 296 15 ml ch4 g vs substrate which was similar to that of ps and remarkably higher than that of ags rtc and was strikingly the bmp of ags rtc 194 10 ml ch4 g vs substrate was significantly lower than that of was 232 11 ml ch4 g vs substrate mechanically destroying the compact structure of ags rtc only accelerated the methane production rate but did not significantly affect the bmp value results indicated that compared to was the proteins and carbohydrates in ags rtc were both more resistant to anaerobic bio degradation which might be related to the presence of refractory microbial metabolic products in ags rtc graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochemical methane potential full scale nereda municipal wastewater treatment plant waste aerobic granular sludge aerobic granular sludge selection discharge physicochemical characteristics 1 introduction conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment systems cas have been widely applied in the treatment of many types of wastewater for decades however large quantities of waste sludge i e primary ps and waste activated sludge was are being produced during this process which is regarded problematic owing to its environmental risk and high cost for treatment and disposal appels et al 2008 a relatively new biological treatment for wastewater is the aerobic granular sludge ags or nereda technology which is applied at full scale since 2005 giesen et al 2013 currently there are over than 70 nereda wastewater treatment plants in operation or under construction worldwide https www royalhaskoningdhv com nereda it s main advantages i e a smaller process footprint quicker sludge settling and reduced energy demand resulted in a rapid market acceptance from promising innovation to a mature technology capable of competing with established conventional wastewater treatment technologies de kreuk et al 2007 pronk et al 2015 the biomass yield represented by the mass of sludge produced over the mass of organic matter cod or bod consumed appears to be similar for aerobic granules and activated sludge as given the same conditions nancharaiah and reddy 2018 as granular sludge processes are typically operated at relatively long solid retention times srts the sludge production of this process would be lower than that of cas in this sense however the waste sludge of ags installations is not yet separately processed with the increasing number and size of nereda installations strategies for the efficient management of generated waste sludge from ags systems wags are required anaerobic digestion ad has been commonly used in the treatment of ps and was with the purpose of organics reduction and energy recovery in the form of biogas similarly ad is a potential option for wags treatment however to our best knowledge the anaerobic digestion of wags has been limitedly studied bengtsson et al 2018 the anaerobic biodegradability of wags with large granules larger than 1 6 mm has been investigated in batch and continuous ad systems bernat et al 2017 del rio et al 2011 del rio et al 2014 palmeiro sanchez et al 2013 most studies merely reported the biochemical methane potential bmp in ml ch4 per g vs substrate of wags but lack information on hydrolysis rate coefficients or degradation efficiencies of its key organic fractions therefore a direct comparison of the biodegradation kinetics of wags with the better understood was degradation is not yet possible furthermore the bmp results of wags are often inconsistent between studies which can be attributed to the highly biodegradable often synthetic or industrial influent used to grow these granules in a well controlled laboratory or pilot scale system the operational conditions of ags systems and its feeding characteristics significantly influence the physiochemical and morphological properties of wags and thus may affect their degradation behaviour in ad bernat et al 2017 de kreuk et al 2010 so far the granular sludge based nereda technology has been mainly applied in municipal wastewater treatment https www royalhaskoningdhv com nereda municipal wastewater typically has a much lower chemical oxygen demand cod concentration than industrial wastewater and has more complex substrates and a higher suspended solids concentration than synthetic influent used in laboratory experiments moy et al 2002 therefore there is a great interest about the actual anaerobic biodegradability of the wags produced in full scale ags systems treating municipal sewage two types of wags can be distinguished 1 sludge that is removed every cycle which we call the aerobic granular sludge selection discharge or selection spill ags sd this is the more flocculent sludge with a lower settling velocity than the aerobic granules by removing this sludge a biological selection pressure is applied towards faster settling granules because it is removed every cycle this waste aerobic granular sludge has had a lower retention time than the granules ali et al 2019 2 the excess granular sludge that originates from biomass growth and that is removed to avoid too high biomass concentrations in the reactor the so called solid retention time control of the ags ags rtc therefore this study systematically assessed 1 the characteristics and anaerobic biodegradability of ags sd and ags rtc as well as 2 the differences in physicochemical property and biodegradability of these fractions with ps and was bmp tests were conducted under mesophilic conditions to compare solids reduction methane yield hydrolysis rate coefficient as well as the biodegradability of carbohydrates proteins lipids and lignocelluloses in all types of sludge these results lead to an improved understanding of the biodegradation of wags in ad and are helpful to design and effectively operate ad systems for wags treatment at full scale implementations 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum ags sd and ags rtc were collected from a full scale municipal wastewater fed nereda system garmerwolde the netherlands which has a treatment capactity of 91 583 population equivalent p e at the time when both types of sludge were sampled the nereda reactor was operated with a process cycles of approximately 6 h 4 h of aeration 1 h of settling 1 h of anaerobic feeding simultaneous effluent withdrawal and 15 min of excess sludge discharge the excess sludge was stored in a sludge buffer tank before being transported to the on site sludge treatment facilities ags rtc was withdrawn at the end of the aeration phase under fully mixed conditions whereas ags sd was collected from the sludge buffer tank wastewater treatment plant wwtp garmerwolde has 6 mm screens followed by grit removal where after the influent is stored for 3 4 h in a mixed influent buffer there is no primary settler pronk et al 2015 and the influent from the buffer tank is directly fed to the nereda tanks was and anaerobic inoculum were sampled from an enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr activated sludge tank under fully aerated and mixed conditions and an anaerobic sludge digester at wwtp harnaschpolder den hoorn the netherlands respectively the latter wwtp is designed for a 1 3 million p e and is equipped with 6 mm screens sand and grit removal followed by a primary clarifier primary sludge ps was sampled from this primary clarifier the inoculum characteristics were ph 8 1 0 4 total solids ts 3 3 0 09 wt and volatile solids vs 2 32 0 03 wt all types of sludge were stored at 4 c for a maximum of 24 h to prevent acidification cellulose microcrystalline powder sigma aldrich usa was used as model substrate for the positive control of the bmp tests wastewater characteristics and operational parameters of both wwtps are shown in table 1 2 2 anaerobic batch bmp test batch bmp tests of sludge were conducted in quadruplicates by using an automated methane potential test system ampts bioprocess control sweden with 500 ml serum bottles one of the serum bottles was sacrificed for vfa concentration measurements the recipes and dosages for phosphorus buffer solution macronutrients and trace elements were according to zhang et al 2014 the volume of the mixture of inoculum and substrate was 300 ml the ratio of vs g of inoculum to vs g of substrate was 2 in the batch bottles vs concentrations of different types of sludge were manipulated by centrifugation 5 min at 3 500 g in order to explain whether the morphology of the sludge affect the biodegradability the structures of ags rtc and was were destroyed by crushing the sludge with a household blender hr2052 90 philips the netherlands for 5 min at 10 000 rpm and 450 w 2 3 biochemical methane potential tests modelling the hydrolysis rate coefficient k and biochemical methane potential b0 two key parameters associated with methane production from the sludge gonzalez et al 2018 were used to evaluate and compare methane production kinetics and bmp values between different types of sludge to analyse the data a two

methane production by the two substrate model was implemented in matlab r2016b mathworks usa 2 4 analytical methods total carbohydrate contents were estimated as a glucose equivalent concentration using a phenol sulfuric acid assay dubois et al 1956 total protein concentrations were determined by the kjeldahl method apha 2005 based on nkj and nh4 n measurements assuming that 1 g protein assumed as c4 h6 1o1 2nx is equivalent to 1 g amino acids 0 16 g nkj and 0 16 g nh4 n total lipids were measured by chloroform methanol extraction method bligh and dyer 1959 volatile fatty acids vfas were analysed by a gas chromatography gc with a flame ionization detector fid agilent 7890a usa the gc was equipped with an agilent 19091f 112 column of 25 m 320 μm 0 5 μm and helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 8 ml min injection temperature was 240 c and oven temperature was 80 c the lignocellulosic fibres content in sludge samples was determined by van soest method van soest 1963 the particle size distribution psd of ags rtc was analysed by a sieving method pronk et al 2015 whereas the psds of the other sludge types including the crushed sludge were measured with a particle size analyser bluewave microtrac germany a digital microscope vhx 6000 keyence belgium with a universal zoom lens from 20 to 200 vh z20ur keyence belgium was used to identify the morphology of the sludge principal component analysis pca for investigating the difference in digestibility between sludges was performed by matlab r2016b mathworks usa for the statistical analysis the student s t test for two groups of samples and one way anova for multiple groups of samples were both applied with spss statistics 25 ibm usa to evaluate the significance of differences in bmps and chemical characteristics between sludges the significance level of probability p value was 0 05 in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge characteristics particle size distribution of each type of sludge was measured to identify the physical difference between the types of sludge fig 1 it is found that the ags rtc sample was dominated by particle sizes larger than 500 μm i e 90 of the total particles which was clearly different from the other sludge samples on the contrary ags sd was composed of particle sizes below 500 μm and therefore showed great similarity with the particle size of was this observed difference in morphology agrees with the results observed by pronk et al 2015 in addition a small fraction of particles in the 500 2000 μm range was observed in ps likely resulting from settling in the primary sedimentation tank the distribution of biochemical components of each sludge sample is presented in table 2 the vs concentrations of all sludge types were adjusted to about 5 by centrifugation in order to minimize the effect of different substrate concentrations in vs on their methane potential wang et al 2015 the used vs concentration is similar to the 3 6 wt range that is usually fed to full scale digesters wwtp harnaschpolder the netherlands however the original vs concentrations of sludge extracted from the different flows were different namely 0 9 0 02 0 4 0 01 0 6 0 01 and 3 3 0 03 wt for ags rtc ags sd was and ps respectively key organic fractions analysed were protein carbohydrates lipids and vfas since they are considered as the most pertinent indicators in assessing and predicting the anaerobic biodegradability of sewage sludge mixtures del rio et al 2011 mottet et al 2010 results show that proteins and carbohydrates predominated in all types of sludge representing in total 58 73 of the organic matter table 2 which are within the typical range reported for sewage sludge del rio et al 2011 gonzalez et al 2018 however the ratio of proteins and carbohydrates differed both ags sd and ps showed a much lower protein carbohydrates ratio than ags rtc and was ags sd contained a similar carbohydrate content as ps which was almost double the carbohydrate content in ags rtc and was the protein content in ags sd was slightly higher than that in ps but still about 30 lower than that in ags rtc and was a large protein fraction in both ags rtc and was was expected since these sludges are mainly composed of cells exo enzymes and microbial metabolic products adav et al 2008 gonzalez et al 2018 different studies also reported that the proteins carbohydrates ratio of the extracellular polymeric structures for ags was usually higher than that for as mcswain et al 2005 zhu et al 2015 which is in line with our findings table 2 the high content of carbohydrates and the deviating proteins carbohydrates ratio of ags sd indicates that this sludge fraction is considerably different from the ags rtc with big granules it is known that in contrast to as ps is rich in fibres and contains much less microbial related organics resulting in the high carbohydrates fraction in this type of sludge bernat et al 2017 the high abundance of fibres in ags sd has been observed before pronk et al 2015 and agrees with the analyses performed in this study fig 2 c and d to verify the fibrous content and composition cellulose hemicellulose and lignin contents in all sludge samples were determined fig 3 the used van soest method was originally developed for the assessment of fibre rich materials of plant origin therefore when the van soest method is applied for sewage sludge characterization the resulting fractions are commonly referred to as like fractions mottet et al 2010 wu et al 2015 fig 3 shows that the content of lignin like and hemicellulose like fractions was approximately 9 and 15 of the vs on average respectively similar for all sludge samples the concentration of the cellulose like fibres in ags sd and ps was similar i e 15 and 18 of the total vs on average respectively this was almost twice the value in ags rtc and was which was 7 and 9 of the total vs on average respectively the result was supported by the microscopic examinations presented in fig 2 confirming that this organic fraction is one of major components of carbohydrates in ags sd it needs to be mentioned that the sum of hemicellulose and cellulose in the was and ags rtc fractions was larger than the total carbohydrates measured fig 3 and table 2 even though these two fractions are part of the total carbohydrate fraction this could be caused by the interference of sludge components and the detergents used in the van soest method for example divalent cations from the sludge matrix could form complexes with the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta used in the hemicellulose extraction step resulting in an overestimation of the hemicellulose content mottet et al 2010 indicated that the colorimetric method for direct carbohydrates determination showed a higher reliability than the van soest fractionation therefore the fibre fractionation in this study should only be used as an indicator of the differences between the sludge types rather than a measure of the actual carbohydrate concentration cellulose embodies between 30 and 50 of the suspended solids in the wastewater of western countries stowa 2010 in conventional sewage treatment cellulose is partly removed in the primary clarifier being included in the ps champagne and li 2009 as is shown in this study as well cellulose entering the activated sludge tanks will be partly degraded ahmed et al 2019 the nereda plant at garmerwolde receives raw sewage without primary clarification it is hypothesized that the large suspended solids like the observed fibres are not likely to interact with the fully developed compact granules and thus will stay part of the more flocculent fraction that is often observed with the ags matrix pronk et al 2015 as a result sludge stratification takes place during settling phase together with the selection pressure applied in granular sludge systems to retain large granules the non granules fraction including the mentioned cellulose fibers can be washed out during the sludge selection discharge 3 2 methane production and degradation kinetics of sludges in bmp tests the different biomass composition as well as the different degree of stabilization will likely lead to a different extent and rate of anaerobic digestion this assumption was verified in a bmp test of which the results are presented in fig 4 the bmp of the positive control was 357 ml ch4 g vs on average which fulfilled the criteria stated by holliger et al 2016 low amounts of total vfas were detected during the first 6 days of digestion of the four sludge samples with a maximum concentration of 332 355 421 and 402 mg l at day 3 for ags rtc was ags sd and ps respectively the inoculum applied for all batch tests was obtained from the full scale digester at harnaschpolder wwtp treating was and ps and was not specifically adapted to the wags fractions del rio et al 2014 showed that after long term acclimation with ags as sole substrate the main microbial populations presented were still those commonly found in digesters treating waste municipal sewage sludge therefore the inoculum used was considered similarly effective for all sludge samples tested results clearly show the lowest bmp value for ags rtc namely 194 ml ch4 g vs substrate this was significantly lower p value 0 01 than the 243 ml ch4 g vs substrate reported for ags grown in a pilot scale reactor fed with synthetic domestic wastewater del rio et al 2011 it should be noted that the organic loading rate to the nereda in garmerwolde was higher than that of the activated sludge plant i e 0 20 and 0 16 g cod g tss d respectively and the cod content of the ags rtc was somewhat higher than that of the was table 2 nonetheless the bmp value of ags rtc was remarkably lower p value 0 02 than that of was our results agree with those of bernat et al 2017 and suggest an inherently lower anaerobic biodegradability of the aerobic granules compared to activated sludge flocs the methane production curves fig 4 could be well fitted with the two substrate model eq 1 fig 4 dotted line r2 0 99 in all studied cases results suggest that all biomass samples consisted of a specific fraction that was rapidly biodegradable and one that was more slowly biodegradable the estimated values of krapid b0 rapid and kslow b0 slow for all types of sludge are shown in table 3 and demonstrate that ags rtc presented a significantly lower krapid p value 0 002 and kslow p value 0 04 than was this calculation was based on the methane production rate whereas the vfa production was excluded since vfa was detected in the first 6 days the k values do not fully represent the hydrolysis rates however compared to was the assessed vfa values in ags rtc were lower as well so it can be concluded that the ags rtc s hydrolysis rate was lower than that of was the ags rtc used in this study mainly consisted of large granules figs 1 and 2 which limits the surface area to volume ratio since the hydrolysis rate is surface proportional angelidaki and sanders 2004 sanders et al 2000 the overall ags rtc digestibility might be determined by the morphological structure of the granules to clarify the influence of morphology over sludge composition on anaerobic digestion ags rtc and was were both mechanically crushed to destroy the physical structure and to achieve a similar particle size distribution fig 3 results from fig 4 and table 3 show that the bmp of the crushed sludges was similar as the non crushed ones the methane production rate however showed different behaviour for the two sludge types all parameters for was did not change remarkably p value 0 05 by crushing revealing that the digestion of was was not affected by the sludge crushing yet ags rtc showed a significant increase p value 0 005 in methane production rate from the rapid convertible fraction krapid and b0 rapid the values found after crushing of ags rtc even approached the values of the rapid digestible fraction of crushed was kinetics of the slowly biodegradable fraction did not statistically change although a small shift from b0 slow to b0 rapid could be seen table 3 this means that destroying the structure of the aerobic granules and increasing its surface area could indeed accelerate the degradation rate of rapidly degradable organics which was in agreement with the observation found by del rio et al 2014 who applied thermal pretreatment to granules in addition crushing liberated a fraction of slowly degradable organics to be degraded more rapidly it should be noted that the total bmp b0 total of crushed granules was similar to that of the intact ags rtc fig 4 and table 3 indicating that the sludge structure only limits digestion rate but not the overall digestibility the results imply that in practice sludge pretreatment of the ags rtc fraction prior to anaerobic digestion could enhance digester performance the bmp of ags sd was just slightly lower than that of ps and remarkably higher than those of ags rtc p value 0 001 and was p value 0 005 also the methane production rate i e both krapid and kslow of both ags sd and ps were distinctly higher table 3 considering the differences in vfa production in combination with the methane production rate it can be stated that also hydrolysis rates of the ags sd and ps are higher than the hydrolysis rates measured for ags rtc and was our present results confirm the high degree of stabilization of ags rtc and the low stabilization degree of the more flocculent ags sd fraction supporting the speculations that were reported by pronk et al 2015 apparently compared to ags ags sd is characterized by a much lower srt in the nereda tank ali et al 2019 resulting in a much higher bmp it should be mentioned that in this study the tested ags sd was taken from a nereda reactor with an operational cycle of 6 h in total which is a common process setting applied in full scale municipal wastewater fed nereda systems stubbé 2016 however the schedule of the process cycle sometimes changes due to other factors such as the weather condition pronk et al 2015 it is worth to investigate in future studies if changes of operational parameters of the nereda reactor could affect the characteristics and the digestibility of the different wags fractions and its overall digestibility 3 3 degradation of organic components in sludges during bmp tests to further elucidate the differences in anaerobic biodegradation of the different sludge types the main organic fractions in the wet sludge mixtures were analysed at the start and the end of the bmp tests table s in supplementary materials the converted fractions during the bmp test are shown in fig 5 one should take into account that the fractions are presented per 100 g wet sludge mixture with initial sludge mixture vs concentrations around 2 7 wt table s in supplementary materials the sum of the fractions accounts for over 96 of the total measured cod reduction considering that the total cod reduction linked to the inoculum in each sludge mixture was 450 60 mg cod 100 g wet sludge mixture the observed cod reduction was indeed significantly different p value 0 002 between the sludges the result of pca according to the degradation of major organic fractions on cod basis fig s in supplementary materials shows that the first component pc1 was related to protein while the second component pc2 referred to carbohydrates these two fractions accounted for the majority of the organics that were anaerobically degraded in all four types of sludge ags rtc and was as well as ps and ags sd respectively were grouped closer together than the sludges sampled from the nereda reactor and the samples from the activated sludge installation this indicates that the two types of waste ags had distinctive characteristics in digestibility which agrees with the bmp results fig 6 presents the changes in the three fibre fractions in the different sludges during ad more than 80 of the cellulose like compounds was degraded while the degradation efficiency for hemicellulose like compounds approximated amounted only 30 in all sludge samples this is in accordance to the degradability during ad found by mottet et al 2010 which were 83 and 33 respectively it is reasonable to assume that the higher content of cellulose in the ags sd and ps was responsible for the additional methane production hemicellulose has a lower molecular weight than cellulose and branches with short lateral sugar chains which are easily hydrolysable polymers perez et al 2002 the low measured degradation of hemicellulose like fraction could be due to the contaminants such as metal edta complexes formed in the analysis as discussed previously even though the amount of carbohydrates and proteins in ags rtc was higher than in was table 2 the methane production from was was larger than that of ags rtc per g vs fig 4 bernat et al 2017 hypothesized that the higher resistance to biodegradation lignin content could explain the observed lower bmp of ags however in our case the content of lignin fraction in ags rtc and was differed only 2 which fall within the standard deviation fig 5 besides the anaerobic biodegradability of lignin in all samples were similar fig 6 the results hence suggest that the lower digestibility of aerobic granules should be ascribed to the inherent limited degradation efficiency of carbohydrates and proteins rather than the higher lignin content in ags table 2 and figs 3 and 6 the exact reason for the observed difference in biodegradation of carbohydrates and proteins between ags rtc and was remains unclear an important fraction of carbohydrates and proteins in ags rtc and was originates from extra cellular polymeric substances eps chen et al 2007 yuan et al 2014 recent studies demonstrated that the distinguished sludge morphology between ags and as was determined by the chemical and mechanical properties of gel forming eps in the sludge of two felz et al 2019 lin et al 2013 possibly the anaerobic conversion of such polymers in ags rtc differs from that in was however conformation of this hypothesis needs more study 4 conclusions based on the results of this research the following conclusions can be drawn the bmp of ags rtc was only 80 of that of was mechanically destroying the compact structure of ags did not affect its bmp but accelerated the degradation rate of rapidly biodegradable organics and liberated a fraction of slowly biodegradable ones resulting in higher methane production rate the bmp of ags sd was similar to the bmp of ps and 1 5 times higher than that of ags rtc mainly due to the slow settle ability of highly biodegradable cellulose like fibres that end up in ags sd fraction of wags proteins and carbohydrates in ags rtc were more difficult to be degraded than those in was even though the amount of these two fractions was higher in ags rtc this difference was hypothesized to be related to the structural differences of eps between these two biomass morphologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
