8805,the synthesis of biogenic scorodite combined with the oxidation of as iii catalysed by granular activated carbon gac was previously demonstrated however the colloidal size of the formed scorodite particles is still a bottleneck as it would hinder the easy separation of the precipitates in a full scale application here we studied the effect of gac concentration on biological scorodite precipitation at thermoacidophilic conditions in batch experiments higher arsenic removal efficiency and precipitation of larger and more stable scorodite particles were found only in biotic tests and at low catalyst concentration of 4 g l 1 furthermore with 4 g l 1 gac the fe and as predominantly precipitated in solution while with 20 g l 1 gac the fe and as predominantly precipitated on the gac for experiments with 4 and 20 g l 1 of gac the average particle size was 66 and 2 6 μm respectively this could be explained by the lower saturation level of the solution at the lower gac level this study shows for the first time that the oxidative catalytic capacity of gac can be used to influence crystallization of scorodite keywords arsenite oxidation activated carbon biological iron oxidation saturation control biological crystallization scorodite 1 introduction arsenic as is a toxic metalloid which is widely dispersed throughout the earth s crust where it is commonly associated with ores of cu zn au and ag 1 the mining and metallurgical industries exploiting these ores contribute substantially to the economic development of metal exporting countries 2 however it results in the generation of acid effluents with high concentrations of as between 500 10 000 ppm mainly in the trivalent form as iii 3 the removal and immobilization of arsenic is commonly accomplished by co precipitation with lime and ferric salts 4 however the precipitated arsenic rich solids are chemically not entirely stable therefore the suitability of such precipitates for long term storage has been questioned as uncontrolled emissions of arsenic from stored arsenic rich solid waste results in unacceptable environmental hazards 5 6 due to the increasing worldwide metal demand and the current trend of exploiting low grade ores more arsenic containing waste is generated hence a proper management of these residues for the disposal and storage becomes even more urgent the mineral scorodite crystalline ferric arsenate dihydrate with formula feaso4 2h2o has been proposed as a suitable carrier medium for stable immobilization and long term storage of arsenic as it combines low solubility with high arsenic content 7 8 in previous studies of our group the biological crystallization of scorodite starting from ferrous iron fe ii and arsenate as v containing solutions inoculated with thermoacidophilic iron oxidizing microbial cultures was demonstrated 9 considering that arsenite as iii is the predominant arsenic species in acidic metallurgical wastewater the efficient oxidation of arsenite to arsenate is required to achieve removal of arsenic as scorodite biological as iii oxidation under thermoacidophilic conditions has been scarcely reported 10 11 only okibe and co workers have described biological oxidation of as iii by the archaea acidianus brierleyi 12 14 as an alternative we previously found that granular activated carbon gac was effective as catalyst for as iii oxidation under thermoacidophilic conditions in the presence of air interestingly when fe ii and the microbial mixed culture were also present scorodite was ultimately formed 15 the catalytic as iii oxidation by granular activated carbon gac in the presence of air or oxygen in acidic solutions was reported previously 16 18 as well as it application as catalyst for enhanced leaching of sulfide minerals 17 19 it has been proposed that hydrogen peroxide is formed at the surface of the activated carbon 20 according to 1 c re d 1 2 o 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 c ox where c red and c ox stands for reduced and oxidized functional groups on the carbon surface respectively subsequently hydrogen peroxide can oxidize as iii and fe ii according to 2 h3aso3 h2o2 h3aso4 h2o 3 fe2 h2o2 2h 2fe3 h2o in our preliminary experiments both as iii and a fraction of fe ii were oxidized by gac in the absence of an fe ii oxidizing thermoacidophilic mixed culture 15 however the formed as v and fe iii remained in solution while under the same conditions but in the presence of a thermoacidophilic mixed culture as v was depleted from solution and precipitated as scorodite the scorodite precipitate consisted of colloidal crystallite agglomerates with a size of 5 μm with settling rates below 0 01 m h the small particle size was attributed to the relatively high degree of saturation of the solution with respect to scorodite 15 the poor settling behaviour makes separation of the particles from the process stream in practice difficult and costly furthermore particle size may negatively affect the stability of scorodite 8 21 22 therefore it is desirable to obtain precipitates with a larger particle size in the scorodite biocrystallisation process to this purpose we investigated the possible effect of the gac catalyst concentration in the oxidation process and the biological precipitation of arsenic as scorodite at ph 1 2 1 3 and 70 c 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and medium

growth medium for the mixed culture was prepared as described previously 15 the growth medium was additionally supplied with 8 8 mm 490 mg l 1 ferrous iron and 6 8 mm 510 mg l 1 arsenic as iii giving a fe as molar ratio of 1 29 ferrous iron and arsenite stock solutions were prepared as described previously 15 arsenate stock solutions were prepared from disodium arsenate heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o fluka switzerland all used chemicals were analytical reagent grade 2 2 batch experiments batch experiments were carried out in 250 ml serum bottles triplicates closed with a butyl rubber stopper and crimped aluminum seal the bottles were supplied with 4 or 20 g l 1 granulated activated carbon gac bottles for abiotic experiments were filled to a final volume of 100 ml with growth medium containing fe ii and as iii bottles for biotic tests contained 90 ml growth medium with fe ii as iii and 10 ml of the pre cultivated thermoacidophilic mixed culture with a concentration of 1 107 cell ml 1 a summary of the conditions used in the batch experiments is shown in table 1 the cell concentration in the bottles was determined by direct counting using a neubauer chamber the headspace 150 ml of the bottles consisted of air implying that at the start oxygen was present in excess by a factor of 2 with respect to the maximum amount needed for full oxidation of as iii and fe ii the bottles were placed in a thermostat shaker incubator at 150 rpm and 70 c during the experiment and samples were taken regularly for analysis of ph eh and dissolved fe and as species since the ph fluctuated between 1 24 and 1 3 during the biotic and abiotic experiments adjustment of ph of the solution was not necessary the precipitates were collected from the bottles at the end of the experiments first the carbon granules were manually separated by sieving and washed with acid water 50 mm of sulphuric acid in order to release any solid particle that might be deposited on the gac the precipitates were separated from the liquid phase by settling and centrifugation the collected precipitates were washed with 50 mm sulphuric acid followed by washing with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at

oxidation was evaluated in batch tests containing 0 4 and 20 g l 1 gac with initial concentrations of 510 mg l 1 as iii and 490 mg l 1 fe ii fig 1 a without gac and without the culture as iii was not oxidized fig 1a while only 7 of the fe ii was oxidized in 16 days without gac but with the culture 228 mg l 1 as iii was removed from solution the as v concentration increased reaching a maximum of 79 mg l 1 on day 7 and subsequently decreased to 17 mg l 1 on day 16 data not shown the formed as v in solution did not match the depleted as iii implying that the total as concentration in solution decreased as shown in fig 1b in the same experiment 275 mg l 1 fe ii was removed while only 11 mg l 1 fe iii accumulated from start to end these results indicate that the mixed culture could oxidize as iii to some extent when grown on fe ii as energy source without fe ii the culture did not oxidize as iii data not shown hardly any as iii and fe ii was oxidized after day 9 revealing the inability of the culture to oxidize as iii to low concentrations under the applied conditions the results furthermore reveal that fe and as precipitated to some extent with a molar ratio of 1 0 1 4 of fe precipitated as precipitated 3 2 as iii and fe ii oxidation in the presence of 4 and 20 g l 1 gac with 4 g l 1 of gac a zero order oxidation rate of 160 and 125 mg l 1 d 1 as iii was estimated in biotic and abiotic experiments respectively until an as iii concentration of 100 mg l 1 was reached fig 1a the difference in abiotic and biotic rate can be explained by the contribution of microbially induced as iii oxidation because in the absence of gac an initial as iii oxidation rate of 27 mg l 1 d 1 was found fig 1a with 20 g l 1 gac as iii oxidation was almost complete within 2 days with no difference in the depletion curve between the biotic and abiotic experiments fig 1a around 1 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide was detected in the bottles with 20 g l 1 of gac immediately after the addition of the granules to the solution fig s1 confirming that equations 1 and 2 play a role in the oxidation of as iii 6 15 with 4 g l 1 of gac in the biotic experiment a specific oxidation rate of 40 1 mgas ggac 1 d 1 was calculated which decreased with almost a factor of 4 in the bottles with 20 g l 1 gac table 2 thus in the experiment with 20 g l 1 gac the catalyst did not exert its maximum oxidation capacity indicating a limitation possibly the oxidation was hampered by the presence of ferric precipitates on the gac surface as with 20 g l 1 gac 7 times more ferric was associated to the gac at the end of the experiment day 16 compared to the experiment with 4 g l 1 table 3 it is noted that some adsorption of arsenic on gac was observed at the beginning of the experiments as the as iii concentration 520 10 mg l 1 decreased immediately after the addition of the gac the adsorption amounted to 1 5 0 5 mg arsenic per gram of gac which lies in the range 0 16 3 5 mgas ggac 1 reported in literature 24 26 although at lower gac concentration the amount of adsorbed arsenic is negligible it becomes more substantial with increasing concentration of the catalyst such as in the bottles with 20 g l 1 of gac where only 470 mg l 1 as iii was measured at the beginning of the experiment in the biotic experiment with 4 g l 1 of gac 453 mg l 1 96 of fe ii was oxidized in 16 days while in the abiotic experiment this was only 123 mg l 1 25 fig 2 c thus the contribution of the microbial culture to fe ii oxidation was dominant compared to the contribution of gac with 20 g l 1 of gac the difference was less pronounced with 64 and 93 fe ii oxidized in the abiotic and biotic experiment respectively fig 2e still this reveals that fe ii can also be oxidized with gac as catalyst even though oxidation of as iii was much faster in our experiments when both ions were present figs 1a 2c and 2e 3 3 effect of gac on fe and as precipitation in the biotic experiment with 4 g l 1 gac the solution became opaque and the first greenish precipitates resembling the colour of scorodite were visible with the naked eye after 4 days in the biotic experiment with 20 g l 1 gac removal of as was evident already after day 1 fig 1b and colloidal like precipitates were visible after 2 days fig 3 b in abiotic experiments the solution remained transparent fig 3 which confirms previous results 15 tables 3 and 4 show the mass balance of as and fe in the bottles and their distribution in the solution dissolved fe and as species in the precipitates and associated with the gac predominantly as precipitate and adsorbed as explained in section 3 2 after 16 days in the biotic experiment with 4 g l 1 gac 76 of the fe and 78 of the as was present in the precipitate and only 8 of the fe and 10 of the as was found in the gac the remainder of fe 16 and as 12 remained in solution thus precipitation in the solution was predominant with only little precipitation on the gac with 20 g l 1 of gac 34 of the fe and 34 of the as was present in the precipitate while 54 of the fe and 49 of the as was found in the gac revealing that with the higher gac concentration precipitation on the gac was predominant over precipitation in solution with 4 g l 1 of gac in the abiotic experiment only 10 of fe and as was associated with the gac after 16 days with the remainder still in solution mainly as fe ii and as v with 20 g l 1 of gac 47 of fe and 34 of as was associated with the gac interestingly the amount of fe associated with the gac is similar for both conditions with 13 and 12 mgfe ggac 1 for 4 and 20 g l 1 of gac respectively for as these values are 12 and 8 mgas ggac 1 respectively in both abiotic experiments arsenite and ferrous oxidation stopped around day 7 and the concentrations of fe ii fe iii as iii and as v did not change after this day revealing that precipitation had also stopped the above results suggest that in the abiotic experiments the fe as precipitates covered oxidation sites on the gac surface thereby preventing further oxidation and subsequent precipitation in the biotic experiments the fe ii oxidizing microorganisms compete with the gac for fe ii clearly at the higher gac concentration of 20 g l 1 more fe ii is oxidized by the gac and more fe precipitates on the gac rather than in solution with 4 g l 1 of gac the oxidation and precipitation of fe on gac does not appear to be affected by the microorganisms as the biotic and abiotic show similar amounts of fe and as on the gac tables 3 and 4 this is also true for fe with 20 g l 1 of gac and to a lesser extent for as the fe as precipitates on the gac had a molar ratio of 1 0 1 9 table 4 from the above the following scheme emerges in the presence of gac and the iron oxidizing culture the gac and the microorganisms compete for fe ii following microbial oxidation the fe iii precipitates with as v in the solution or on the cell surface while fe ii oxidized by the gac precipitates with as v on the surface of the gac thereby inactivating the gac 3 4 characterization of the precipitates the concentration of gac influenced the as iii and fe ii oxidation rates and consequently also the saturation state of the solution is affected fig 4 a the saturation index si of the solution calculated from ratio of iap and the ksp of scorodite 10 22 27 ranged between 1 1 4 reaching the maximum value on day 2 in the biotic experiments with 4 g l 1 gac which coincided with the onset of depletion of as and fe from solution fig 4b furthermore the iap in solution reached values close to 22 observed between day 1 7 fig 4a which are in the range of reported ksp values for scorodite 10 22 9 28 30 indicating that the solution was only slightly oversaturated in that period the particle size distribution psd of precipitates collected at the end of the biotic experiments is shown in fig 5 with 4 g l 1 gac the average particle size was 66 μm while with 20 g l 1 gac it was only 2 6 μm with a substantial colloidal fraction with particle sizes under 1 μm apparently as the higher saturation index with 20 g l 1 gac nucleation was favoured over crystal growth thereby yielding particles with small crystal size 31 the xrd analysis of the precipitates confirmed that scorodite was formed in all biotic experiments fig 6 however sharper peaks were found in the diffractogram of solids from the experiment with 4 g l 1 gac compared to experiments with 20 g l 1 indicating a higher crystallinity the computed crystallinity of the samples by crystallography open database cod indicated 83 and 54 of crystallinity in the precipitates collected from experiments with 4 and 20 g l 1 of gac respectively the higher background or hump observed in the diffractogram of precipitates with 20 g l 1 gac is indicative either of poorly crystalline material or of fine carbon particles present in the sample since a similar pattern was detected in the xrd of the raw gac data not shown besides in the diffractogram a broad peak in the region 2θ 10 7 could not be identified in the database but this peak was also observed in the pattern of carbon granules washed with sulphuric acid data not shown the fe as molar ratio of the solids measured by icp oes was 1 2 and 1 35 respectively table 1 supplementary information the structural water content of the precipitates was also determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga fig 7 the tga curve of the precipitates collected from bottles with 4 g l 1 gac showed the inflection point between 160 and 240 c with a calculated weight loss of 15 4 fig 7a this value is close to the theoretical value of 15 6 corresponding to 2 molecules of water in mineral scorodite between 245 and 500 c the water loss was 2 3 this was also observed in a previous study of our group 9 in which we suggested that this was due to the presence of organic matter the water content of the precipitates collected from experiments supplied with 20 g l 1 gac was around 18 5 with the inflection point between 130 230 c this higher value implies the formation of poorly crystalline phases rather than fully crystallized scorodite 32 the ft ir analysis of the precipitates displayed peaks at 819 and 795 cm 1 fig 7b and d characteristic for arsenate stretching and bending bands ⱱ3aso4 3 in agreement with the reported bands for biogenic and mineral scorodite 9 33 34 another vibration band observed at 1054 cm 1 in fig 7b was related to phosphate or organic material ondruš skála 35 the vibration bands for sulfate were absent in the spectra of the biogenic precipitates with 4 g l 1 gac indicating that the sample was free of sulfate contrarily a strong band occurring at 983 cm 1 in the spectra of solids collected from 20 g l 1 of gac in fig 7d indicated the presence of sulfate in the precipitates presumably this was due to the presence of basic ferric arsenate sulfate 36 bending vibration of the water molecule in the solids were also found at 1619 cm 1 and 1587 cm 1 fig 7b and d respectively both values are in agreement with those reported previously 35 37 furthermore the bands displayed at 2964 cm 1 and 2997 cm 1 correlate to the o h bond between crystalline water groups and oxygen of the arsenate molecules that occurs in the region 2900 3080 as well the similar stretch bands observed at 3518 3520 cm 1 coincide with weaker o h bond between oxygen atoms in crystalline water fig 7b and d 38 scanning electron microscopy of the precipitates collected at day 16 revealed the presence of solids with the typical dipyramidal habit of scorodite fig 8 a and b also rod shaped microorganisms associated with the scorodite precipitates and the gac surface were found fig s2 this observation supports the hypothesis that the microbial surface served as heterogeneous nucleation perhaps after adsorption of ferric and arsenate ions the results of the arsenic leaching test revealed that the scorodite precipitates collected from the experiment with 4 g l 1 gac leached around 0 87 0 2 mg l 1 of as after 24 h similarly a concentration of 0 91 0 07 mg l 1 as was measured in leachate samples after 30 days these results revealed that the produced scorodite was stable under the studied conditions in contrast the leaching of the solids produced in experiments with 20 g l 1 gac showed an increase from 3 63 mg l 1 as after 24 h to 5 11 0 15 mg l 1 as at the end of the leaching tests the leached concentration of arsenic with these precipitates was above the permissible us epa level of 5 mg l 1 as although the difference in the leaching behaviour of scorodite produced under atmospheric or hydrothermal conditions has been attributed to different factors such as particle size and the molar fe as the crystallinity of the precipitates seem to be an important parameter determining leaching characteristics of scorodite 7 28 the formation of poorly crystalline phases has been explained by the fast precipitation rate caused by the rapid fe ii oxidation which consequently affects the saturation of the solution allowing nucleus formation over the growth of the crystal 39 40 the uncontrolled precipitation as observed in biotic tests with 20 g l 1 gac led to the formation of fine precipitates identified mainly as scorodite by powder diffraction analysis due to the low computed crystallinity of these solids 54 it is possible that non crystalline phases have developed along with scorodite triggering the fast leaching of arsenic 41 4 conclusions the results presented here demonstrate the impact of the concentration of gac on the precipitation of scorodite starting from as iii and fe ii containing medium inoculated with thermoacidophilic iron oxidizing microorganisms with higher gac concentrations the contribution of gac catalysed iron oxidation increases relative to microbial oxidation fe ii oxidized by gac has a tendency to precipitate with as v formed through gac catalysed oxidation of as iii on the surface of the gac this results in inactivation of the oxidative capacity of the gac with higher gac concentrations relatively more fe and as precipitate on the catalyst furthermore higher gac concentrations result in higher fe ii and as iii oxidation rates and higher concentrations of fe iii and as v resulting in a higher saturation state of the solution with respect to scorodite in turn this results in the formation of smaller scorodite particles which are less stable the controlled biological oxidation of fe ii achieved in the experiments with 4 g l 1 gac allowed to keep the saturation index below 1 5 leading to the formation of settleable particles which as leaching behaviour that comply with the usepa limit value even after 30 days the proposed mechanism is a potential option for the treatment of diluted as iii acid streams therefore future studies aim to reproduce and scale up the process for the continuous treatment of as iii containing acid streams credit authorship contribution statement

at low catalyst concentration of 4 g l 1 furthermore with 4 g l 1 gac the fe and as predominantly precipitated in solution while with 20 g l 1 gac the fe and as predominantly precipitated on the gac for experiments with 4 and 20 g l 1 of gac the average particle size was 66 and 2 6 μm respectively this could be explained by the lower saturation level of the solution at the lower gac level this

generation of acid effluents with high concentrations of as between 500 10 000 ppm mainly in the trivalent form as iii 3 the removal and immobilization of arsenic is commonly accomplished by co

crystalline ferric arsenate dihydrate with formula feaso4 2h2o has been proposed as a suitable carrier medium for stable immobilization and long term storage of arsenic as it combines low solubility

thermoacidophilic iron oxidizing microbial cultures was demonstrated 9 considering that arsenite as iii is the predominant arsenic species in acidic metallurgical wastewater the efficient oxidation of arsenite to arsenate is required to achieve removal of arsenic as scorodite biological as iii oxidation under thermoacidophilic conditions has been scarcely reported 10 11 only okibe and co workers

oxidation by granular activated carbon gac in the presence of air or oxygen in acidic solutions was reported previously 16 18 as well as it application as catalyst for enhanced leaching of sulfide minerals 17 19 it has been proposed that hydrogen peroxide is formed at the surface of the activated carbon 20 according to 1 c re d 1 2 o 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 c ox where c red and c ox stands for reduced and oxidized functional groups on the carbon surface respectively subsequently hydrogen peroxide can oxidize as iii and fe ii according to 2 h3aso3 h2o2 h3aso4 h2o 3 fe2 h2o2 2h 2fe3 h2o in our preliminary experiments both as iii and a fraction of fe ii were oxidized by gac in the absence of an fe ii oxidizing thermoacidophilic mixed culture 15 however the formed as v and fe iii remained in solution while under the same conditions but in the presence of a thermoacidophilic mixed culture as v was depleted from solution and precipitated as scorodite the scorodite precipitate consisted of colloidal crystallite agglomerates with a size of 5 μm with settling rates below 0 01 m h the small particle size was attributed to the relatively high degree of saturation of the solution with respect to scorodite 15 the poor settling behaviour makes separation of the particles from the process stream in practice difficult and costly furthermore particle size may negatively affect the stability of scorodite 8 21 22 therefore it is desirable to obtain precipitates with a larger particle size in the scorodite biocrystallisation process to this purpose we investigated the possible

summary of the conditions used in the batch experiments is shown in table 1 the cell concentration in the bottles was determined by direct counting using a neubauer chamber the headspace 150 ml of the bottles consisted of air implying that at the start oxygen was present in excess by a factor of 2 with respect to the maximum amount needed for full oxidation of as iii and fe ii the bottles were placed in a thermostat shaker incubator at 150 rpm and 70 c during the experiment and samples were taken regularly for analysis of ph eh and dissolved fe and as species since the ph fluctuated between 1 24 and 1 3 during the biotic and abiotic experiments adjustment of ph of the solution was not necessary the precipitates were collected from the bottles at the end of the experiments first the carbon granules were manually separated by sieving and washed with acid water 50 mm of sulphuric acid in order to release any solid particle that might be deposited on the gac the precipitates were separated from the liquid phase by settling and centrifugation the collected precipitates were washed with 50 mm sulphuric acid followed by washing with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at

oxidation was evaluated in batch tests containing 0 4 and 20 g l 1 gac with initial concentrations of 510 mg l 1 as iii and 490 mg l 1 fe ii fig 1 a without gac and without the culture as iii was not oxidized fig 1a while only 7 of the fe ii was oxidized in 16 days without gac but with the culture 228 mg l 1 as iii was removed from solution the as v concentration increased reaching a maximum of 79 mg l 1 on day 7 and subsequently decreased to 17 mg l 1 on day 16 data not shown the formed as v in solution did not match the depleted as iii implying that the total as concentration in solution decreased as shown in fig 1b in the same experiment 275 mg l 1 fe ii was removed while only 11 mg l 1 fe iii accumulated from start to end these results indicate that the mixed culture could oxidize as iii to some extent when grown on fe ii as energy source without fe ii the culture did not oxidize as iii data not shown hardly any as iii and fe ii was oxidized after day 9 revealing the inability of the culture to oxidize as iii to low concentrations under the applied conditions the results furthermore reveal that fe and as precipitated to some extent with a molar ratio of 1 0 1 4 of fe precipitated as precipitated 3 2 as iii and fe ii oxidation in the presence of 4 and 20 g l 1 gac with 4 g l 1 of gac a zero order oxidation rate of 160 and 125 mg l 1 d 1 as iii was estimated in biotic and abiotic experiments respectively until an as iii concentration of 100 mg l 1 was reached fig 1a the difference in abiotic and biotic rate can be explained by the contribution of microbially induced as iii oxidation because in the absence of gac an initial as iii oxidation rate of 27 mg l 1 d 1 was found fig 1a with 20 g l 1 gac as iii oxidation was almost complete within 2 days with no difference in the depletion curve between the biotic and abiotic experiments fig 1a around 1 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide was detected in the bottles with 20 g l 1 of gac immediately after the addition of the granules to the solution fig s1 confirming that equations 1 and 2 play a role in the oxidation of as iii 6 15 with 4 g l 1 of gac in the biotic experiment a specific oxidation rate of 40 1 mgas ggac 1 d 1 was calculated which decreased with almost a factor of 4 in the bottles with 20 g l 1 gac table 2 thus in the experiment with 20 g l 1 gac the catalyst did not exert its maximum oxidation capacity indicating a limitation possibly the oxidation was hampered by the presence of ferric precipitates on the gac surface as with 20 g l 1 gac 7 times more ferric was associated to the gac at the end of the experiment day 16 compared to the experiment with 4 g l 1 table 3 it is noted that some adsorption of arsenic on gac was observed at the beginning of the experiments as the as iii concentration 520 10 mg l 1 decreased immediately after the addition of the gac the adsorption amounted to 1 5 0 5 mg arsenic per gram of gac which lies in the range 0 16 3 5 mgas ggac 1 reported in literature 24 26 although at lower gac concentration the amount of adsorbed arsenic is negligible it becomes more substantial with increasing concentration of the catalyst such as in the bottles with 20 g l 1 of gac where only 470 mg l 1 as iii was measured at the beginning of the experiment in the biotic experiment with 4 g l 1 of gac 453 mg l 1 96 of fe ii was oxidized in 16 days while in the abiotic experiment this was only 123 mg l 1 25 fig 2 c thus the contribution of the microbial culture to fe ii oxidation was dominant compared to the contribution of gac with 20 g l 1 of gac the difference was less pronounced with 64 and 93 fe ii oxidized in the abiotic and biotic experiment respectively fig 2e still this reveals that fe ii can also be oxidized with gac as catalyst even though oxidation of as iii was much faster in our experiments when both ions were present figs 1a 2c and 2e 3 3 effect of gac on fe and as precipitation in the biotic experiment with 4 g l 1 gac the solution became opaque and the first greenish precipitates resembling the colour of scorodite were visible with the naked eye after 4 days in the biotic experiment with 20 g l 1 gac removal of as was evident already after day 1 fig 1b and colloidal like precipitates were visible after 2 days fig 3 b in abiotic experiments the solution remained transparent fig 3 which confirms previous results 15 tables 3 and 4 show the mass balance of as and fe in the bottles and their distribution in the solution dissolved fe and as species in the precipitates and associated with the gac predominantly as precipitate and adsorbed as explained in section 3 2 after 16 days in the biotic experiment with 4 g l 1 gac 76 of the fe and 78 of the as was present in the precipitate and only 8 of the fe and 10 of the as was found in the gac the remainder of fe 16 and as 12 remained in solution thus precipitation in the solution was predominant with only little precipitation on the gac with 20 g l 1 of gac 34 of the fe and 34 of the as was present in the precipitate while 54 of the fe and 49 of the as was found in the gac revealing that with the higher gac concentration precipitation on the gac was predominant over precipitation in solution with 4 g l 1 of gac in the abiotic experiment only 10 of fe and as was associated with the gac after 16 days with the remainder still in solution mainly as fe ii and as v with 20 g l 1 of gac 47 of fe and 34 of as was associated with the gac interestingly the amount of fe associated with the gac is similar for both conditions with 13 and 12 mgfe ggac 1 for 4 and 20 g l 1 of gac respectively for as these values are 12 and 8 mgas ggac 1 respectively in both abiotic experiments arsenite and ferrous oxidation stopped around day 7 and the concentrations of fe ii fe iii as iii and as v did not change after this day revealing that precipitation had also stopped the above results suggest that in the abiotic experiments the fe as precipitates covered oxidation sites on the gac surface thereby preventing further oxidation and subsequent precipitation in the biotic experiments the fe ii oxidizing microorganisms compete with the gac for fe ii clearly at the higher gac concentration of 20 g l 1 more fe ii is oxidized by the gac and more fe precipitates on the gac rather than in solution with 4 g l 1 of gac the oxidation and precipitation of fe on gac does not appear to be affected by the microorganisms as the biotic and abiotic show similar amounts of fe and as on the gac tables 3 and 4 this is also true for fe with 20 g l 1 of gac and to a lesser extent for as the fe as precipitates on the gac had a molar ratio of 1 0 1 9 table 4 from the above the following scheme emerges in the presence of gac and the iron oxidizing culture the gac and the microorganisms compete for fe ii following microbial oxidation the fe iii precipitates with as v in the solution or on the cell surface while fe ii oxidized by the gac precipitates with as v on the surface of the gac thereby inactivating the gac 3 4 characterization of the precipitates the concentration of gac influenced the as iii and fe ii oxidation rates and consequently also the saturation state of the solution is affected fig 4 a the saturation index si of the solution calculated from ratio of iap and the ksp of scorodite 10 22 27 ranged between 1 1 4 reaching the maximum value on day 2 in the biotic experiments with 4 g l 1 gac which coincided with the onset of depletion of as and fe from solution fig 4b furthermore the iap in solution reached values close to 22 observed between day 1 7 fig 4a which are in the range of reported ksp values for scorodite 10 22 9 28 30 indicating that the solution was only slightly oversaturated in that period the particle size distribution psd of precipitates collected at the end of the biotic experiments is shown in fig 5 with 4 g l 1 gac the average particle size was 66 μm while with 20 g l 1 gac it was only 2 6 μm with a substantial colloidal fraction with particle sizes under 1 μm apparently as the higher saturation index with 20 g l 1 gac nucleation was favoured over crystal growth thereby yielding particles with small crystal size 31 the xrd analysis of the precipitates confirmed that scorodite was formed in all biotic experiments fig 6 however sharper peaks were found in the diffractogram of solids from the experiment with 4 g l 1 gac compared to experiments with 20 g l 1 indicating a higher crystallinity the computed crystallinity of the samples by crystallography open database cod indicated 83 and 54 of crystallinity in the precipitates collected from experiments with 4 and 20 g l 1 of gac respectively the higher background or hump observed in the diffractogram of precipitates with 20 g l 1 gac is indicative either of poorly crystalline material or of fine carbon particles present in the sample since a similar pattern was detected in the xrd of the raw gac data not shown besides in the diffractogram a broad peak in the region 2θ 10 7 could not be identified in the database but this peak was also observed in the pattern of carbon granules washed with sulphuric acid data not shown the fe as molar ratio of the solids measured by icp oes was 1 2 and 1 35 respectively table 1 supplementary information the structural water content of the precipitates was also determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga fig 7 the tga curve of the precipitates collected from bottles with 4 g l 1 gac showed the inflection point between 160 and 240 c with a calculated weight loss of 15 4 fig 7a this value is close to the theoretical value of 15 6 corresponding to 2 molecules of water in mineral scorodite between 245 and 500 c the water loss was 2 3 this was also observed in a previous study of our group 9 in which we suggested that this was due to the presence of organic matter the water content of the precipitates collected from experiments supplied with 20 g l 1 gac was around 18 5 with the inflection point between 130 230 c this higher value implies the formation of poorly crystalline phases rather than fully crystallized scorodite 32 the ft ir analysis of the precipitates displayed peaks at 819 and 795 cm 1 fig 7b and d characteristic for arsenate stretching and bending bands ⱱ3aso4 3 in agreement with the reported bands for biogenic and mineral scorodite 9 33 34 another vibration band observed at 1054 cm 1 in fig 7b was related to phosphate or organic material ondruš skála 35 the vibration bands for sulfate were absent in the spectra of the biogenic precipitates with 4 g l 1 gac indicating that the sample was free of sulfate contrarily a strong band occurring at 983 cm 1 in the spectra of solids collected from 20 g l 1 of gac in fig 7d indicated the presence of sulfate in the precipitates presumably this was due to the presence of basic ferric arsenate sulfate 36 bending vibration of the water molecule in the solids were also found at 1619 cm 1 and 1587 cm 1 fig 7b and d respectively both values are in agreement with those reported previously 35 37 furthermore the bands displayed at 2964 cm 1 and 2997 cm 1 correlate to the o h bond between crystalline water groups and oxygen of the arsenate molecules that occurs in the region 2900 3080 as well the similar stretch bands observed at 3518 3520 cm 1 coincide with weaker o h bond between oxygen atoms in crystalline water fig 7b and d 38 scanning electron microscopy of the precipitates collected at day 16 revealed the presence of solids with the typical dipyramidal habit of scorodite fig 8 a and b also rod shaped microorganisms associated with the scorodite precipitates and the gac surface were found fig s2 this observation supports the hypothesis that the microbial surface served as heterogeneous nucleation perhaps after adsorption of ferric and arsenate ions the results of the arsenic leaching test revealed that the scorodite precipitates collected from the experiment with 4 g l 1 gac leached around 0 87 0 2 mg l 1 of as after 24 h similarly a concentration of 0 91 0 07 mg l 1 as was measured in leachate samples after 30 days these results revealed that the produced scorodite was stable under the studied conditions in contrast the leaching of the solids produced in experiments with 20 g l 1 gac showed an increase from 3 63 mg l 1 as after 24 h to 5 11 0 15 mg l 1 as at the end of the leaching tests the leached concentration of arsenic with these precipitates was above the permissible us epa level of 5 mg l 1 as although the difference in the leaching behaviour of scorodite produced under atmospheric or hydrothermal conditions has been attributed to different factors such as particle size and the molar fe as the crystallinity of the precipitates seem to be an important parameter determining leaching characteristics of scorodite 7 28 the formation of poorly crystalline phases has been explained by the fast precipitation rate caused by the rapid fe ii oxidation which consequently affects the saturation of the solution allowing nucleus formation over the growth of the crystal 39 40 the uncontrolled precipitation as observed in biotic tests with 20 g l 1 gac led to the formation of fine precipitates identified mainly as scorodite by powder diffraction analysis due to the low computed crystallinity of these solids 54 it is possible that non crystalline phases have developed along with scorodite triggering the fast leaching of arsenic 41 4 conclusions the results presented here demonstrate the impact of the concentration of gac on the precipitation of scorodite starting from as iii and fe ii containing medium inoculated with thermoacidophilic iron oxidizing microorganisms with higher gac concentrations the contribution of gac catalysed iron oxidation increases relative to microbial oxidation fe ii oxidized by gac has a tendency to precipitate with as v formed through gac catalysed oxidation of as iii on the surface of the gac this results in inactivation of the oxidative capacity of the gac with higher gac concentrations relatively more fe and as precipitate on the catalyst furthermore higher gac concentrations result in higher fe ii and as iii oxidation rates and higher concentrations of fe iii and as v resulting in a higher saturation state of the solution with respect to scorodite in turn this results in the formation of smaller scorodite particles which are less stable the controlled biological oxidation of fe ii achieved in the experiments with 4 g l 1 gac allowed to keep the saturation index below 1 5 leading to the formation of settleable particles which as leaching behaviour that comply with the usepa limit value even after 30 days the proposed mechanism is a potential option for the treatment of diluted as iii acid streams therefore future studies aim to reproduce and scale up the process for the continuous treatment of as iii containing acid streams credit authorship contribution statement

electrolysis time electrode distance initial ph and stirring speed on the ec ability to remove hardness ions ca2 mg2 and dissolved silica from ctbw under the optimized condition magnesium rod

exchange the residual heat of the vaporization is emitted by mixing two types of fluids with different temperatures resulting in a decrease in the temperature of the hot fluid the system of evaporative cooling water loses its pure vapor and tends to raise the concentration of dissolved solids in the remaining water if this cycle continues the solubility of many solids will finally be reduced the solids will then be placed in the shape of shale on the warm surface of the condenser pipes the formation of scales in cooling water systems reduces the heat transfer efficiency by insulating the metal surface from the cooling water thereby preventing the transfer of heat when the formation of the scale reaches a critical point the hydraulic hindrance impact reduces the flow of water dramatically 1 depending on the minerals in the water the most commonly found cooling salts are calcium carbonate calcium phosphate iron oxides magnesium silicate and silica factors that affect the scale leaning on the cooling tower include water quality ph temperature and water flow rate 2 the control of scale deposits in cooling water systems is necessary to maintain maximum heat transfer efficiency the formation of scale in the cooling tower can be controlled by increasing ctbw to limit cycles of concentration 3 the volume of blowdown water required for optimal cooling tower operation could be reduced by removing or eliminating the scale forming ions from cooling tower water and then recycling the clean water to the cooling tower circuit make up water treatment is also a way of reducing the scale formation in the cooling system growing prices for freshwater frequent dryness and water shortages have motivated industries to try and reduce water use recycling the clean water can gain substantial pecuniary profits because of the large volumes of water required in cooling towers 4 there are several treatment technologies to reduce scaling in cooling water systems such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration ion exchange and chemical coagulation methods 5 8 this technology is not suitable for treating cooling water with high levels of scale forming ions due to the effect of fouling on the membranes 6 membrane and ion exchange processes are not enough to treat the blowdown water of the cooling tower 9 10 many scientists used several electrochemical techniques to draw attention to efficiency and eco friendly processing the most important reaction is the electron a clean reagent which explains the reduced waste output associated with ec methods 11 one of the main advantages of ec is that no chemicals are used consequently there is no chance of secondary pollution making ec a green technology that can be used effectively for ctbw treatment 12 in the present study magnesium is used as anode and the main chemical reactions occurring in ec cells are as follows 13 1 at the cathode 2h2o 2e h2 g 2oh 2 at the anode mg mg2 2e 3 in the solution mg2 aq 2h2o mg oh 2 2h the oh formed at the cathode increases the ph of the ctbw and thereby induces the precipitation of mg2 ions as corresponding hydroxides and co precipitation with magnesium hydroxides 14 mg2 and oh ions produced in ec cells will immediately undergo additional spontaneous hydrolysis responses to form multiple monomeric and polymeric species which will eventually turn into mg oh 3 s based on complicated precipitation kinetics 15 16 several studies in ec technology applications were published in the literature 17 20 including the removal of organic compounds 21 metal ions 22 23 colloidal abrasive particles 24 phosphate 25 and viruses 26 limited researches were reported on the treatment of potentially scale forming ions namely ca2 mg2 ions and silica from the ctbw hafez et al 27 researched the efficacy of ec in the removal of hardness ions and silica from ctbw using al fe and zn electrodes zhi et al 28 studied the application of surface response methodology to optimize the removal of silica from ctbw by ec gelover et al 29 studied the electro generation of aluminum as a coagulant for the removal of silica in water for cooling towers schulz et al 30 investigated the performance of ec by using fe and al electrodes to remove scale forming ions from ctbw and reverse osmosis reject water in addition liao et al 31 established the effect of anti scaling compounds on the efficiency of ec using al and fe electrodes for the treatment of ctbw they reported that anti scaling compounds used as coagulation aids were increasing hardness ions removal using magnesium as electrode material was already studied in ec 32 35 however magnesium electrode application in the ec reactor was never earlier researched to remove scale ions from ctbw previous authors research 27 showed that ec use of al electrode was effective in removing scale ions from ctbw the primary disadvantage of al electrode however is the remaining amount of aluminum as the usepa rules suggest that the maximum water aluminum values of 0 05 0 2 mg l due to cathodic dissolution 36 there is no such disadvantage in the event of magnesium electrodes as the usepa rules recommend maximum water magnesium values of 30 mg l the aim of this work was to study optimization of the ec technique with magnesium rod electrode in the removal of scale forming ions from the cooling tower recirculation water once it s discharged in particular the goal of this study was to reuse of treated ctbw as makeup water to a cooling tower 2 material and methods 2 1 ctbw source and characteristics ctbw was collected from the effluent of an urea fertilizer plant helwan fertilizer company egypt samples were collected at the pump in clean 1 l plastic bottles that had been carefully rinsed with the respective samples prior to collection and labeled the plant produces approximately 40 m3 of ctbw per hour usually ctbw is discarded into the wastewater drain the physical and chemical properties of ctbw are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental set up and procedure as shown in fig 1 a batch monopolar electrochemical plexiglas container of 1 l capacity with the dimensions of l w h 11 8 0 8 0 cm magnesium rod was used as the anode and stainless steel rod of the same dimensions as the cathode a pair of parallel electrodes with an active surface area of 65 cm2 operated in the monopolar mode was vertically positioned in the reactor and paired with dr meter 30v 5a power supply magnesium electrodes were polished mechanically with sandpaper before each round and soaked in a solution of 6 chromic acid and 5 hno3 for 45 s and then washed with distilled water 37 such electrodes were mounted in the ec apparatus and the anode cathode inter electrode distance of 1 0 cm was kept the inner container volume was nearly 0 60 l ctbw was agitated using intllab magnetic stirrer ms 500 at a rotational speed of 300 rpm the samples were filtered through 4 μm filter paper after settling time of 30 min the filtrates were examined later 2 3 analytical methods the filtered ctbw was analyzed to determine the scale ions concentration the analysis was performed using the apha 2012 standard methods 38 the cations and anions were determined using unico sq2800 uv vis spectrophotometer and dionex ics 1000 ion chromatograph the ph was measured by using fisherbrand fe150 ph meter and the conductivity was measured by horiba laqua ds70 conductivity meter 2 4 characterization of the sludge a scanning electron microscope hitachi s 3600 n was used to evaluate the surface morphology of the produced sludge and the oxford inca 350 edx device was combined with the microscope to conduct an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy that provides an elemental analysis using x ray diffractometer thermo arl x ray diffractometer usa xlens pd6 software was used to investigate the phase and crystal structure of this produced sludge fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer irprestige 21 shimadzu confirms the presence of different functional groups of the produced sludge using irsolution software the capacity to settle sludge was assessed using the sludge volume index svi the following equation was used to determine the svi ml g 4 svi ml g sv mlss x 1000 where sv is the settled sludge volume in the transparent imhoff cone graduated in 1 l after 30 min of settlement and mlss is a sustained solid mixed liquor sludge volume index svi is a significant parameter measuring sludge settlement capability that can guide the design and control of settling tanks 39 2 5 operating cost estimation of the operating cost oc of ec treatment using magnesium rod electrode can be calculated by considering two parameters as major cost items they are electrode material and electrical energy costs 40 oc as us m3of the treated ctbw was calculated with the following equation 5 oc α c energy β c electrode where cenergy kwh m3 is the energy consumption and celectrode kg m3 is the electrode consumption unit prices α and β are given from the egypt market in august 2019 are the electrical energy price 0 04 us kwh and magnesium rod electrode price 1 0 us kg the energy and electrode consumptions levels are calculated by means of the following equations 41 6 c energy kwh m3 u і t ec ν where u is the applied voltage і is the current a t ec is the operating time s or h and ν is volume of the ctbw in the ec

the faraday constant 1 f 9 65 104 c mole 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of current density one of the most important operating parameters in ec is current density which has an integral effect on process efficiency 42 fig 2 showed that by raising the current density from 1 43 to 14 29 ma cm2 the removal efficiency of the total hardness improved from 20 0 to 51 80 meanwhile the removal efficiency of silica increased from 48 0 to 93 70 increasing current density results in an increase in the amount of mg2 ions promoting the process of electrochemical precipitation 16 43 above optimum current density 14 29 ma cm2 the efficiency of hardness ions and silica removal was decreased this may be due to passivation of the electrode this result is in full agreement with other investigations 44 an economic evaluation of the electrode consumption and energy consumption at current density ranging from 1 43 to 18 57 ma cm2 at a constant electrolysis time 60 min fig 3 shows the impact of current density on electrode consumption energy consumption and total operating costs as shown in the fig 3 a c increased current density has resulted in an increase in electrode consumption energy consumption and total costs the electrode consumption was calculated as 0 19 to 1 34 kg m3 energy consumption values were 0 18 to 3 05 kwh m3 and total operating costs were 0 09 to 1 14 us m3 no significant increase in the removal efficiency of the magnesium rod electrode at higher current density has been achieved therefore the operating costs were determined to be 0 88 us m3 celectrode exp 0 82 kg m3 and cenergy 1 81 kwh m3 at the optimum conditions current density of 14 29 ma cm2 electrolysis time 60 min 300 rpm stirring speed and electrode distance of 1 0 cm the contribution of this study both in terms of efficiency and cost can be further confirmed by comparing the cost of treatment in the previous study 45 the operating costs of the current work are lower than the operating costs of the process reported by sharma et al 46 for the removal of hardness ions from wastewater using al electrode with an operating cost of 1 01 us m3 villegas mendoza et al 47 reported that operating costs on the removal of dissolved silica from ctbw using ec with al electrodes were approximately 0 53 us m3 studied by zhi et al 28 stated that silica removal from cooling water by ec using al electrode is achieved by the following 83 243 of silica removal efficiency 1 466 kwh m3 of energy consumption 0 0400 kg m3of electrode consumption and 0 245 kg m3 of sludge production 3 2 effect of electrolysis time the effect of electrolysis time on the removal of scale ions within 15 90 min was evaluated in this study at constant current density 14 29 ma cm2 fig 4 showed that hardness ions and silica removal efficiency depended greatly on the amount of metal ion produced by the magnesium rod anodes the levels of mg2 ions improved with increased electrolysis time 15 as shown in fig 4 a rise in the electrolysis time from 15 to 60 min resulted in an increased efficiency of removal of total hardness from 19 44 to 51 80 and silica from 77 0 to 93 70 however above the optimum time there was no significant removal of both hardness ions and silica was achieved this may be because dissolved metal ions and their hydroxides have been found at the saturation stage of floc formation 46 also it would be possible to evidence passivation phenomena on the electrodes due to mg oh 2 films formation fig 5 shows the effect of electrolysis time on consumption of electrodes energy consumption and total operating costs these results showed that the anode material consumption increased linearly by increasing the electrolysis time and subsequently the operating costs increased at a constant current density of 14 29 ma cm2 the electrolysis time increased from 15 to 60 min increasing the experimental electrode consumption from 0 38 to 0 82 kg m3 according to faraday s law the theoretical electrode consumption in the reaction from 15 to 60 min was 0 21 to 0 49 kg m3 in fact the experimental consumption of electrodes could have exceeded the theoretical value it is evident that the electrode consumption contributes significantly in addition to electrochemical and chemical reactions to the dissolution of magnesium electrodes to the production of mg3 ion coagulants 36 moreover the corrosion and oxidation of the electrode surface could explain this phenomenon 48 3 3 effect of electrode distance at current density of 14 29 ma cm2 the electrodes are set at an electrode distance range of 0 5 to 3 0 cm and the results are given in fig 6 the shorter distance between the electrodes 0 5 cm resulted in a reduction in the flow of the solution from each other thereby decreasing the removal efficiency a further increase in the distance between the electrodes up to 1 cm improves the efficiency of scale ions removal further increasing the distance between the electrodes the efficiency of the scaling ions was reduced this is mainly due to weaker interaction between the generated flocks and the scale molecules 49 as a result the optimum electrode distance chosen was 1 cm 3 4 effect of initial ph a significant factor that impacts the efficiency of ec is the initial ph value only at the beginning of each test was ph evaluated the results fig 7 revealed that there was a clear trend of rising hardness ions removal efficiency by increasing initial ph from 4 0 to 10 0 as the initial ph increased from 4 0 to 10 0 total hardness ions removal efficiency increased from 38 80 to 56 63 however the removal efficiency of silica exposed different patterns by increasing the ph from 4 0 to 8 0 silica removal decreased slightly from 95 70 to 93 70 further increase in the ph from 8 0 to 10 0 decreased the removal rates from 93 70 to 83 81 at lower ph magnesium hydrolysis products are in the form of mg2 as soluble metal and therefore the ability to adsorb any pollutants was at least at neutral and higher ph the mg2 and oh were generated by magnesium rod anode to form many monomeric and polymeric metal hydroxide species 41 the hydroxides of these metals are complex and converted in part into insoluble hydroxides made up of amorphous metals with plentiful groups of hydroxyl surfaces for adsorbing hardness ions and silica with increasing the ph to 10 0 the rate of hardness removal increased due to the formation of mg oh 2 the big surfaces of these magnesium hydroxides are suitable for quick adsorption of hardness ions 40 by adding naoh or nh4oh as alkaline reagents to an aqueous solution containing calcium ions and bicarbonate ions oh ions were formed during dissociation hydroxide ions react with hco3 ions to form carbonate ions followed by calcium carbonate precipitation as a solid phase 50 at ph 10 0 the removal efficiency of the silica decreased due to the precipitation reaction at the recorded alkaline condition 40 3 5 effect of the stirring speed fig 8 shows the effect of stirring speeds between 80 and 600 rpm on the effectiveness of removal for both hardness ions and silica the results show that hardness ions and silica have increased their removability by increasing the stirring speed from 80 to 300 rpm an additional increase in the stirring speed from 300 to 600 rpm reduces the effectiveness of scale ions removal therefore the 300 rpm stirring speed was selected as the optimum value increasing the stirring speed to the optimum value increases the removal of the scale forming ions as a consequence of improved ion mobility at increased stirring speed this can be ascribed to floc formation the latter is responsible for the sedimentation of the pollutants nevertheless the increase in the stirring speed beyond the optimum value induces the breakup of the formed flocs furthermore collision degrades the flocks due to higher rpm leading to a less successful removal 42 3 6 efficiency of the ec performance for the treatment of ctbw an experiment was carried out by applying the previously determined optimum conditions the optimum conditions were a current density of 14 29 ma cm2 electrolysis time of 60 min electrode distance of 1 0 cm and a stirring speed of 300 rpm table 2 illustrates ctbw characterization before and after ec the results showed a marked reduction in all concentrations of the scale forming ions the total hardness and silica were removed by 51 80 and 93 70 respectively on the other hand the concentrations of iron and zinc decreased from 0 1 mg l and 1 2 mg l to less than 0 01 mg l 3 7 analysis of produced sludge from the ec produced sludge characterization was conducted to explore the mechanism for the removal of scale forming ions through ec the chemical analysis of the sludge was evaluated by svi sem edx xrd and ft ir the final disposal of the sludge formed at the end of the ec would be confined in a special container for further treatment 3 7 1 settling fig 9 presents the settling characteristics of magnesium rod electrode generated sludge after the ec the obtained results revealed that the sludge volume was 110 ml within 60 min sedimentation time the svi sludge volume

rod electrode showed in fig 12 table 4 shows all the allocated bands of ft ir range of the produced sludge in relation to ir spectral libraries 51 this ft ir spectrum showed a powerful 3649 cm 1 adsorption band that was assigned to be free oh stretching vibration as mg oh 2 52 the adsorption band was found at 1688 cm 1 and can be allocated as h o h bending vibration 53 a broad absorption band at 3445 cm 1 indicates the alteration from free protons into a proton conductive state in brucite 54 the broad adsorption band is related to o h vibration in the center of 3000 and 3500 cm 1 functional groups of the sludge showed electrolyte interaction between flocks and cations the findings showed the significant function of the sludge functional groups produced during the ec in removing colloids 4 conclusion the removal of hardness ions ca2 mg2 and dissolved silica from ctbw can be successfully achieved by ec using magnesium rod electrode in this study the removal of scale ions from the ctbw results showed that a maximum removal efficiency of 51 80 and 93 70 can be reached for hardness ions and silica respectively using magnesium rod electrode with a current density of 14 29 ma cm2 60 min electrolysis 300 rpm stirring speed and 1 0 cm electrode distance under optimum operating conditions the electrode consumption energy consumption and total operating cost were found to be 0 82 kg m3 1 81 kwh m3 and 0 88 us m3 respectively the sludge svi was 169 ml g which shows better settling properties sem images of sludge depicted knotty particles with a small particle

exchange the residual heat of the vaporization is emitted by mixing two types of fluids with different temperatures resulting in a decrease in the temperature of the hot fluid the system of evaporative cooling water loses its pure vapor and tends to raise the concentration of dissolved solids in the remaining water if this cycle continues the solubility of many solids will finally be reduced the solids will then be placed in the shape of shale on the warm surface of the condenser pipes the formation of scales in cooling water systems reduces the heat transfer efficiency by insulating the metal surface from the cooling water thereby preventing the transfer of heat when the formation of the scale reaches a critical point the hydraulic hindrance impact reduces the flow of water dramatically 1 depending on the minerals in the water the most commonly found cooling salts are calcium carbonate calcium phosphate iron oxides magnesium silicate and silica factors that affect the scale leaning on the cooling tower include water quality ph temperature and water flow rate 2 the control of scale deposits in cooling water systems is necessary to maintain maximum heat transfer efficiency the formation of scale in the cooling tower can be controlled by increasing ctbw to limit cycles of concentration 3 the volume of blowdown water required for optimal cooling tower operation could be reduced by removing or eliminating the scale forming ions from cooling tower water and then recycling the clean water to the cooling tower circuit make up water treatment is also a way of reducing the scale formation in the cooling system growing prices for freshwater frequent dryness and water shortages have motivated industries to try and reduce water use recycling the clean water can gain substantial pecuniary profits because of the large volumes of water required in cooling towers 4 there are several treatment technologies to reduce scaling in cooling water systems such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration ion exchange and chemical coagulation methods 5 8 this technology is not suitable for treating cooling water with high levels of scale forming ions due to the effect of fouling on the membranes 6 membrane and ion exchange processes are not enough to treat the blowdown water of the cooling tower 9 10 many scientists used several electrochemical techniques to draw attention to efficiency and eco friendly processing the most important reaction is the electron a clean reagent which explains the reduced waste output associated with ec methods 11 one of the main advantages of ec is that no chemicals are used consequently there is no chance of secondary pollution making ec a green technology that can be used effectively for ctbw treatment 12 in the present study magnesium is used as anode and the main chemical reactions occurring in ec cells are as follows 13 1 at the cathode 2h2o 2e h2 g 2oh 2 at the anode mg mg2 2e 3 in the solution mg2 aq 2h2o mg oh 2 2h the oh formed at the cathode increases the ph of the ctbw and thereby induces the precipitation of mg2 ions as corresponding hydroxides and co precipitation with magnesium hydroxides 14 mg2 and oh ions produced in ec cells will immediately undergo additional spontaneous hydrolysis responses to form multiple monomeric and polymeric species which will eventually turn into mg oh 3 s based on complicated precipitation kinetics 15 16 several studies in ec technology applications were published in the literature 17 20 including the removal of organic compounds 21 metal ions 22 23 colloidal abrasive particles 24 phosphate 25 and viruses 26 limited researches were reported on the treatment of potentially scale forming ions namely ca2 mg2 ions and silica from the ctbw hafez et al 27 researched the efficacy of ec in the removal of hardness ions and silica from ctbw using al fe and zn electrodes zhi et al 28 studied the application of surface response methodology to optimize the removal of silica from ctbw by ec gelover et al 29 studied the electro generation of aluminum as a coagulant for the removal of silica in water for cooling towers schulz et al 30 investigated the performance of ec by using fe and al electrodes to remove scale forming ions from ctbw and reverse osmosis reject water in addition liao et al 31 established the effect of anti scaling compounds on the efficiency of ec using al and fe electrodes for the treatment of ctbw they reported that anti scaling compounds used as coagulation aids were increasing hardness ions removal using magnesium as electrode material was already studied in ec 32 35 however magnesium electrode application in the ec reactor was never earlier researched to remove scale ions from ctbw previous authors research 27 showed that ec use of al electrode was effective in removing scale ions from ctbw the primary disadvantage of al electrode however is the remaining amount of aluminum as the usepa rules suggest that the maximum water aluminum values of 0 05 0 2 mg l due to cathodic dissolution 36 there is no such disadvantage in the event of magnesium electrodes as the usepa rules recommend maximum water magnesium values of 30 mg l the aim of this work was to study optimization of the ec technique with magnesium rod electrode in the removal of scale forming ions from the cooling tower recirculation water once it s discharged in particular the goal of this study was to reuse of treated ctbw as makeup water to a cooling tower 2 material and methods 2 1 ctbw source and characteristics ctbw was collected from the effluent of an urea fertilizer plant helwan fertilizer company egypt samples were collected at the pump in clean 1 l plastic bottles that had been carefully rinsed with the respective samples prior to collection and labeled the plant produces approximately 40 m3 of ctbw per hour usually ctbw is discarded into the wastewater drain the physical and chemical properties of ctbw are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental set up and procedure as shown in fig 1 a batch monopolar electrochemical plexiglas container of 1 l capacity with the dimensions of l w h 11 8 0 8 0 cm magnesium rod was used as the anode and stainless steel rod of the same dimensions as the cathode a pair of parallel electrodes with an active surface area of 65 cm2 operated in the monopolar mode was vertically positioned in the reactor and paired with dr meter 30v 5a power supply magnesium electrodes were polished mechanically with sandpaper before each round and soaked in a solution of 6 chromic acid and 5 hno3 for 45 s and then washed with distilled water 37 such electrodes were mounted in the ec apparatus and the anode cathode inter electrode distance of 1 0 cm was kept the inner container volume was nearly 0 60 l ctbw was agitated using intllab magnetic stirrer ms 500 at a rotational speed of 300 rpm the samples were filtered through 4 μm filter paper after settling time of 30 min the filtrates were examined later 2 3 analytical methods the filtered ctbw was analyzed to determine the scale ions concentration the analysis was performed using the apha 2012 standard methods 38 the cations and anions were determined using unico sq2800 uv vis spectrophotometer and dionex ics 1000 ion chromatograph the ph was measured by using fisherbrand fe150 ph meter and the conductivity was measured by horiba laqua ds70 conductivity meter 2 4 characterization of the sludge a scanning electron microscope hitachi s 3600 n was used to evaluate the surface morphology of the produced sludge and the oxford inca 350 edx device was combined with the microscope to conduct an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy that provides an elemental analysis using x ray diffractometer thermo arl x ray diffractometer usa xlens pd6 software was used to investigate the phase and crystal structure of this produced sludge fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer irprestige 21 shimadzu confirms the presence of different functional groups of the produced sludge using irsolution software the capacity to settle sludge was assessed using the sludge volume index svi the following equation was used to determine the svi ml g 4 svi ml g sv mlss x 1000 where sv is the settled sludge volume in the transparent imhoff cone graduated in 1 l after 30 min of settlement and mlss is a sustained solid mixed liquor sludge volume index svi is a significant parameter measuring sludge settlement capability that can guide the design and control of settling tanks 39 2 5 operating cost estimation of the operating cost oc of ec treatment using magnesium rod electrode can be calculated by considering two parameters as major cost items they are electrode material and electrical energy costs 40 oc as us

prices α and β are given from the egypt market in august 2019 are the electrical energy price 0 04 us kwh and magnesium rod electrode price 1 0 us kg the energy and electrode consumptions levels are calculated by means of the following equations 41 6 c energy kwh m3 u і t ec ν where u is the applied voltage і is the current a t ec is the operating time s or h and ν is volume of the ctbw in the ec

the faraday constant 1 f 9 65 104 c mole 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of current density one of the most important operating parameters in ec is current density which has an integral effect on process efficiency 42 fig 2 showed that by raising the current density from 1 43 to 14 29 ma cm2 the removal efficiency of the total hardness improved from 20 0 to 51 80 meanwhile the removal efficiency of silica increased from 48 0 to 93 70 increasing current density results in an increase in the amount of mg2 ions promoting the process of electrochemical precipitation 16 43 above optimum current density 14 29 ma cm2 the efficiency of hardness ions and silica removal was decreased this may be due to passivation of the electrode this result is in full agreement with other investigations 44 an economic evaluation of the electrode consumption and energy consumption at current density ranging from 1 43 to 18 57 ma cm2 at a constant electrolysis time 60 min fig 3 shows the impact of current density on electrode consumption energy consumption and total operating costs as shown in the fig 3 a c increased current density has resulted in an increase in electrode consumption energy consumption and total costs the electrode consumption was calculated as 0 19 to 1 34 kg m3 energy consumption values were 0 18 to 3 05 kwh m3 and total operating costs were 0 09 to 1 14 us m3 no significant increase in the removal efficiency of the magnesium rod electrode at higher current density has been achieved therefore the operating costs were determined to be 0 88 us m3 celectrode exp 0 82 kg m3 and cenergy 1 81 kwh m3 at the optimum conditions current density of 14 29 ma cm2 electrolysis time 60 min 300 rpm stirring speed and electrode distance of 1 0 cm the contribution of this study both in terms of efficiency and cost can be further confirmed by comparing the cost of treatment in the previous study 45 the operating costs of the current work are lower than the operating costs of the process reported by sharma et al 46 for the removal of hardness ions from wastewater using al electrode with an operating cost of 1 01 us m3 villegas mendoza et al 47 reported that operating costs on the removal of dissolved silica from ctbw using ec with al electrodes were approximately 0 53 us m3 studied by zhi et al 28 stated that silica removal from cooling water by ec using al electrode is achieved by the following 83 243 of silica removal efficiency 1 466 kwh m3 of energy consumption 0 0400 kg m3of electrode consumption and 0 245 kg m3 of sludge production 3 2 effect of

desalination units where the predominant scale potential is from calcium sulphate it contains polymer and phosphinosuccinic oligomer pso wherein it functions as stabilizing and dispersing agents and it can be used above the 266 f 130 c top brine temperature also this scale inhibitor has a tracing material which allows special analyzers to measure it to monitor control the dosage rate and optimize it it was found that calcium sulphate solubility significantly increased after injecting the acid base antiscalant e automation of antiscalant feed system new antiscalant technology was implemented to eliminate scale in the tubes effect and to sustain higher distillate production the technology provides 24 7 online monitoring of plant operation key parameters to control both the water quality analysis and anti scalant dosage the technology is represented by an online analyzer control and dosage system the online analyzer takes the samples from three different locations in the unit before and after the chemical injection point and analyze the water through tracing material in the antiscalant chemical and then adjust the dosage rate to control the antiscalant concentration in the seawater inlet also one sample is taken from rejected brine to measure the rejected antiscalant through tracing material to control the cycle of concentration coc f maintain brine concentration in the unit the unit is designed for a certain make up flow which is considered the major contributing factor of concentrated brine rejected by the unit this ensures sufficient wetting of the tubes and

tank flow reverse manifold strainers temperature pressure gauges and flow meter and make a circulatory loop vents were installed at high points and drains were installed at low points and connect these to the pump suction tank the unit was filled with distilled water the circulation was started at 4 5 bar and continue flushing the system with water until the effluent water is free from loose

arabian gulf countries use desalinated water from thermal desalination units for human necessities and to generate high pressure steam to generate power multi stage flash msf and multi effect desalination med units are commonly used multi stage flash msf and multi effects desalination med units production rates are negatively affected over time by the high salinity in the arabian gulf where it reaches 51 000 ppm in some locations in saudi arabia saudi aramco ras tanura refinery rtr has one msf unit commissioned in 1978 and four med tvc units commissioned in 2002 where their production rates declined over the years because of scaling issues the purpose of this paper is to highlight and discuss the scaling factors efficient chemical cleaning scale and deposits control the paper includes troubleshooting analysis actions taken and the results 2 ras tanura refinery desalination plants description ras tanura refinery rtr produces distilled water from seawater in an msf using 15 psig 1 03 bar steam as the heat source with a capacity of 300 gpm 1 635 m3 day rtr msf is a brine circulation type with 190 f 87 8 c as top brine temperature tbt it has one brine heater and total of 15 stages in a series to produce the distilled water where the vapor is created during flowing of the seawater the remaining hot brine is transferred freely from chamber to another where it is flashed there the advantage of that is to maintain the hot brine conditions outside and inside heating tubes in order to minimize scale formation on the tubes surface which is a major advantage over the original and simple concept of thermal evaporation see fig 1 distilled water is also produced in four med units using 150 psig 10 3 bar steam with 525 gpm 2 865 m3 day per unit for a total capacity of 1 200 gpm 6 540 m3 day rtr meds are parallel with thermal vacuum compression each unit consists of four effects and one distilled condenser each effect has a tube bank where the vapor formation takes place by suppling 150 psig 10 3 bar of steam in the first effect tubes and spraying seawater into the top of the tube bank the vapor generated from the first effect is considered as the heating media for the second effect tubes the vapor is condensed after spraying the seawater and sent to the distillate condenser see fig 2 the units treat seawater with 51 000 ppm of total dissolved solid tds and minimizes solids carryover into the distillate for purity of not more than 5 ppm of tds 3 general deficiencies in desalination plants most thermal desalination units were not producing at their maximum capacity due to several contributing factors the major challenge is scale formation this section discusses the major contributors to scale formation 3 1 seawater temperature and salinity seawater temperature and salinity play a major role in scale formation where the salts tend to be crystallized at high temperature due to low solubility of calcium sulphate 3 2 seawater filtration debris always plugs some condenser tubes and can also plug spray nozzles causing insufficient tube wetting or dry spots which result in accelerated scale formation seawater strainers have to be frequently back washed to minimize passing debris to the unit checking spray nozzles during the shutdown opportunity and positioning them correctly compared to the tube bundle so that the water is sprayed on the tubes 3 3 chemical dosing the choice of chemicals antiscalant and anti foam is very important to ensure long term operation with few acids cleaning the dosing rate also needs to be sufficient for the local conditions using an anti foam from the same chemical manufacturer as the anti scalant helps to have the most synergy and efficiency between the two products the proper antiscalant has to be chosen based on the seawater salinity and top brine temperature tbt of the unit 3 4 high brine level in the effects it is caused usually caused by low performance of brine reject pump operating med at high brine level leads to deposits on the bottom side of the tubes 3 5 seawater velocity in msf tubes low tube velocity plays a major role in accelerating the formation of scale since the carbonate molecules tend to deposit and adhere on the tube surface at relatively low velocity low velocity is caused due to low performance of brine circulation pump 4 challenges and discussion scaling is the most common type of deposition in desalination units and is commonly associated with inverse solubility salts such as calcium carbonate caco3 calcium sulphate caso4 and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 found in seawater two scale deposit samples collected from the desalination unit were submitted to the lab for chemical composition determination x ray powder diffraction xrd technique was used to determine the composition of the submitted samples the results revealed that the both samples mainly consisted of calcium sulphate hydrate gypsum caso4 2h2o and calcium carbonate scale aragonite caco3 and calcite caco3 with minor amounts of corrosion product greigite f3s4 and calcium sulphate hydrate gypsum caso4 2h2o see table 1 4 1 parallel feed multiple effect desalination with thermal vapor compression med tvc based on the scale found inside the units the troubleshooting results showed and clarified the main constrains those limiting the med production specifically a mechanical issues which include 1 seawater pump performance was low and could not reach the desired flowrate and the cause was that the impeller clearance was not as per the pump design 2 vacuum leak which disturb the heat balance inside the unit this was caused due to old and defective gaskets around the effects doors 3 spray nozzles where the water was found not distributed properly over the tubes due to sand and debris which plugged the nozzles b inefficient chemical cleaning procedure due to inefficient acid strength and overdose of corrosion inhibitor as a results the enhancement of scale reduction in rtr meds were completed in two steps inhabiting and descaling see figs 3 5 4 1 1 inhibition of scale formation six important actions were taken to minimize scale formation disinfection injection mechanical adjustment and automate the antiscalant inhibitor dosing a disinfection the desalination units have a history of biological growth and fouling on the exchangers and effects the disinfection chemical type was replaced by chlorine dioxide clo2 clo2 as a disinfectant had been evaluated over 10 months for treating seawater feeding the units the evaluation shows 1 microbiological analysis gap y m show improvement where the results decreased from 2 3 107 cells ml to below 100 cells ml after implementing clo2 which will reduce the main corrosion mechanism 2 total of 16 seawater strainers 1 372 mm od x 2 005 mm h coated carbon steel pressure back wash frequency was reduced from 8 h to 35 h 3 improvement in heat transfer coefficient by 70 in exchangers b cleaning seawater intake the seawater intake was full of sand and debris which impact the med tubes and heat transfer rate to clean the intake a submergible pump was used to remove sand and debris that accumulated over the years at the bottom of the intake canal c mechanical adjustment all spray nozzle positions were corrected as per the design angle and unplugged to get proper wetting of the tube bundles to avoid any hot spot on the tubes that might cause scale and tube failure it was found that before implementing the recommendations the fouling resistance r increased by 0 0014 m2 k w to reach 0 0035 m2 k w within 365 days 3 9 10 6 m2 k w per day fortunately the fouling resistance r increasing rate was found reduced to be 6 14 10 7 m2 k w per day and reached 0 0025 m2 k w within 730 days see figs 6 7 4 1 2 descaling scale is difficult to be removed mechanically and needs a frequent chemical cleaning to maintain the plant efficiency to evaluate the best choice of the acid cleaner the material composition of a scale deposit must be known to be cleaned and the metallurgy used in the med plant cost safety concerns and then suitable cleaning agent can be determined see table 2 according to the scale analysis the majority of the scale is coming from calcium carbonate caco3 more than 90 and minor calcium sulphate caso4 and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 the metallurgy in rtr med is mainly titanium tubes stainless steel 316 for distilled water pipes fiber glass and cemented pipes for brine water pipes and stainless steel smo 254 for the shells see figs 8 10 the descaling was completed by implementing two stages of chemical cleaning using 5 wt inhibited sulfamic acid and 5 wt inhibited ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta first sulfamic acid was circulated for 48 h and the samples were collected hourly the results were after that the edta was circulated for 48 h after drain the acid and do water wash in the unit the results were at the end of the second application of the process a total of 354 kg of scale were removed 234 kg of calcium sulphate and 120 kg of calcium carbonate the following pictures show the difference between before and after the chemical cleaning processes the first sample sample 1 in the picture above was taken in the beginning of the process sample 2 was taken after 12 h sample 3 was taken after 24 h and sample 4 was taken at the end of the cleaning process after 30 h the change in turbidity between the samples reflects the effectiveness of the cleaning process inside the unit the color of the entrained liquid in the second picture after completing the process shows that dirt and scale were removed from the unit see figs 11 14 after implementing all mentioned actions med production returned to the design capacity see figs 15 18 4 2 multi stage flash brine circulation see table 3 rtr msf brine heater and stages 1 12 were found plugged by hard scale calcium sulphate as a result the unit production decreased the scale formation and low production were investigated and the results the acid was circulated at 4 5 bar and the temperature was adjusted to 60 72 c the circulation is continued until hydrochloric acid concentration falls below 3 0 or if iron exceeds 10 000 mg l then the solution was drained see figs 19 21 3 neutralization solution of water with chloride content 50 ppm mixed with 0 5 1 0 w w soda was circulated for 1 h to neutralize the residual acid inside the system after implementing all mentioned actions rtr msf production returned to the design capacity 5 conclusions recommendations based on the resulted outputs and the earlier discussion and analysis it was concluded that desalination process is sensitive process where many factors can lead to performance reduction however thermal desalination process is easy to be maintained and restore its production capacity moreover it was noticed that one failure led to multi failures in the unit such as unadjusted spray nozzles in med led to heavy scale on the tubes tubes hot spots high temperature and then low performance in addition general actions are recommended to maintain thermal desalination unit production and minimize scale formation 1 improve unit monitoring by focusing on a maintaining top brine temperature tbt as per the design b maintaining make up flow rate on meds and as per design to ensure maximum tube wetting and avoid hot spots c maintaining brine circulation flow rate in msf as per design to ensure getting the required velocity inside the tubes d loss of total

desalination units where the predominant scale potential is from calcium sulphate it contains polymer and phosphinosuccinic oligomer pso wherein it functions as stabilizing and dispersing agents and it can be used above the 266 f 130 c top brine temperature also this scale inhibitor has a tracing material which allows special analyzers to measure it to monitor control the dosage rate and optimize it it was found that calcium sulphate solubility significantly increased after injecting the acid base antiscalant e automation of antiscalant feed system new antiscalant technology was implemented to eliminate scale in the tubes effect and to sustain higher distillate production the technology provides 24 7 online monitoring of plant operation key parameters to control both the water quality analysis and anti scalant dosage the technology is represented by an online analyzer control and dosage system the online analyzer takes the samples from three different locations in the unit before and after the chemical injection point and analyze the water through tracing material in the antiscalant chemical and then adjust the dosage rate to control the antiscalant concentration in the seawater inlet also one sample is taken from rejected brine to measure the rejected antiscalant through tracing material to control the cycle of concentration coc f maintain brine concentration in the unit the unit is designed for a certain make up flow which is considered the major contributing factor of concentrated brine rejected by the unit this ensures sufficient wetting of the tubes and limits the risk of scale formation adjusting the flow on the design decreases the risk of local overconcentration fig 5 fig 6 med t a fouling resistance r before taken actions fig 6 fig 7 med t a

production before implementing the recommendation a improper antiscalant dosing and monitoring caused frequent clogging in the brine heater tubes and stages the dosing system was replaced by new technology where dosing is automatic fig 15 fig 16 scale build up in msf brine heater b low seawater velocity lower than the design velocity inside the tubes as a result of the low performance of brine circulation pumps their performance was restored after the overhaul and unplugging of the unit tubes allowing the seawater to flow freely without obstructions c vacuum leaks were found at different locations which introduced air into the unit and disturbed unit parameters a vacuum decay test was applied for 2 h after fixing and tightening all leaks d production was found to be leaking into the brine pool due to passing of the dump valves and troughs distillate tray box at different stages all dumps valves and damaged troughs were replaced and repaired to avoid further loss fig 16 fig 17 sign of water leakage to brine pool e a large amount of material mud silt biofouling seaweed and corrosion products was found inside the unit which reduced the antiscalant effectiveness as mentioned previously silt mud and biofouling were treated by fixing the strainers cleaning the seawater intake canal and dosing with chlorine dioxide as a disinfecting agent fig 17 fig 18 accumulated mud inside stages f improper tube cleaning during shutdown where the cleaning was limited to hydrojetting a chemical cleaning procedure was developed to clean the tubes using inhibited hydrochloric acid this ensured the removal scale particles because if these scales are not cleaned completely the remaining scale inside the tube surface may encourage scale deposition again the chemical cleaning procedure consists of the following steps 1 preliminary water flushing the inlet and outlet point of the tube side of the unit were connected to centrifugal pump with capacity 0 4000 l min and mixing tank flow reverse manifold strainers temperature pressure gauges and flow meter and make a circulatory loop vents were installed at high points and drains were installed at low points and connect these to the pump suction tank the unit was filled with distilled water the circulation was started at 4 5 bar and continue flushing the system with water until the effluent water is free from loose

arabian gulf countries use desalinated water from thermal desalination units for human necessities and to generate high pressure steam to generate power multi stage flash msf and multi effect desalination med units are commonly used multi stage flash msf and multi effects desalination med units production rates are negatively affected over time by the high salinity in the arabian gulf where it reaches 51 000 ppm in some locations in saudi arabia saudi aramco ras tanura refinery rtr has one msf unit commissioned in 1978 and four med tvc units commissioned in 2002 where their production rates declined over the years because of scaling issues the purpose of this paper is to highlight and discuss the scaling factors efficient chemical cleaning scale and deposits control the paper includes troubleshooting analysis actions taken and the results 2 ras tanura refinery desalination plants description ras tanura refinery rtr produces distilled water from seawater in an msf using 15 psig 1 03 bar steam as the heat source with a capacity of 300 gpm 1 635 m3 day rtr msf is a brine circulation type with 190 f 87 8 c as top brine temperature tbt it has one brine heater and total of 15 stages in a series to produce the distilled water where the vapor is created during flowing of the seawater the remaining hot brine is transferred freely from chamber to another where it is flashed there the advantage of that is to maintain the hot brine conditions outside and inside heating tubes in order to minimize scale formation on the tubes surface which is a major advantage over the original and simple concept of thermal evaporation see fig 1 distilled water is also produced in four med units using 150 psig 10 3 bar steam with 525 gpm 2 865 m3 day per unit for a total capacity of 1 200 gpm 6 540 m3 day rtr meds are parallel with thermal vacuum compression each unit consists of four effects and one distilled condenser each effect has a tube bank where the vapor formation takes place by suppling 150 psig 10 3 bar of steam in the first effect tubes and spraying seawater into the top of the tube bank the vapor generated from the first effect is considered as the heating media for the second effect tubes the vapor is condensed after spraying the seawater and sent to the distillate condenser see fig 2 the units treat seawater with 51 000 ppm of total dissolved solid tds and minimizes solids carryover into the distillate for purity of not more than 5 ppm of tds 3 general deficiencies in desalination plants most thermal desalination units were not producing at their maximum capacity due to several contributing factors the major challenge is scale formation this section discusses the major contributors to scale formation 3 1 seawater temperature and salinity seawater temperature and salinity play a major role in scale formation where the salts tend to be crystallized at high temperature due to low solubility of calcium sulphate 3 2 seawater filtration debris always plugs some condenser tubes and can also plug spray nozzles causing insufficient tube wetting or dry spots which result in accelerated scale formation seawater strainers have to be frequently back washed to minimize passing debris to the unit checking spray nozzles during the shutdown opportunity and positioning them correctly compared to the tube bundle so that the water is sprayed on the tubes 3 3 chemical dosing the choice of chemicals antiscalant and anti foam is very important to ensure long term operation with few acids cleaning the dosing rate also needs to be sufficient for the local conditions using an anti foam from the same chemical manufacturer as the anti scalant helps to have the most synergy and efficiency between the two products the proper antiscalant has to be chosen based on the seawater salinity and top brine temperature tbt of the unit 3 4 high brine level in the effects it is caused usually caused by low performance of brine reject pump operating med at high brine level leads to deposits on the bottom side of the tubes 3 5 seawater velocity in msf tubes low tube velocity plays a major role in accelerating the formation of scale since the carbonate molecules tend to deposit and adhere on the tube surface at relatively low velocity low velocity is caused due to low performance of brine circulation pump 4 challenges and discussion scaling is the most common type of deposition in desalination units and is commonly associated with inverse solubility salts such as calcium carbonate caco3 calcium sulphate caso4 and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 found in seawater two scale deposit samples collected from the desalination unit were submitted to the lab for chemical composition determination x ray powder diffraction xrd technique was used to determine the composition of the submitted samples the results revealed that the both samples mainly consisted of calcium sulphate hydrate gypsum caso4 2h2o and calcium carbonate scale aragonite caco3 and calcite caco3 with minor amounts of corrosion product greigite f3s4 and calcium sulphate hydrate gypsum caso4 2h2o see table 1 4 1 parallel feed multiple effect desalination with thermal vapor compression med tvc based on the scale found inside the units the troubleshooting results showed and clarified the main constrains those limiting the med production specifically a mechanical issues which include 1 seawater pump performance was low and could not reach the desired flowrate and the cause was that the impeller clearance was not as per the pump design 2 vacuum leak which disturb the heat balance inside the unit this was caused due to old and defective gaskets around the effects doors 3 spray nozzles where the water was found not distributed properly over the tubes due to sand and debris which plugged the nozzles b inefficient chemical cleaning procedure due to inefficient acid strength and overdose of corrosion inhibitor as a results the enhancement of scale reduction in rtr meds were completed in two steps inhabiting and descaling see figs 3 5 4 1 1 inhibition of scale formation six important actions were taken to minimize scale formation disinfection injection mechanical adjustment and automate the antiscalant inhibitor dosing a disinfection the desalination units have a history of biological growth and fouling on the exchangers and effects the disinfection chemical type was replaced by chlorine dioxide clo2 clo2 as a disinfectant had been evaluated over 10 months for treating seawater feeding the units the evaluation shows 1 microbiological analysis gap y m show improvement where the results decreased from 2 3 107 cells ml to below 100 cells ml after implementing clo2 which will reduce the main corrosion mechanism 2 total of 16 seawater strainers 1 372 mm od x 2 005 mm h coated carbon steel pressure back wash frequency was reduced from 8 h to 35 h 3 improvement in heat transfer coefficient by 70 in exchangers b cleaning seawater intake the seawater intake was full of sand and debris which impact the med tubes and heat transfer rate to clean the intake a submergible pump was used to remove sand and debris that accumulated over the years at the bottom of the intake canal c mechanical adjustment all spray nozzle positions were corrected as per the design angle and unplugged to get proper wetting of the tube bundles to avoid any hot spot on the tubes that might cause scale and tube failure it was found that before implementing the recommendations the fouling resistance r increased by 0 0014 m2 k w to reach 0 0035 m2 k w within 365 days 3 9 10 6 m2 k w per day fortunately the fouling resistance r increasing rate was found reduced to be 6 14 10 7 m2 k w per day and reached 0 0025 m2 k w within 730 days see figs 6 7 4 1 2 descaling scale is difficult to be removed mechanically and needs a frequent chemical cleaning to maintain the plant efficiency to evaluate the best choice of the acid cleaner the material composition of a scale deposit must be known to be cleaned and the metallurgy used in the med plant cost safety concerns and then suitable cleaning agent can be determined see table 2 according to the scale analysis the majority of the scale is coming from calcium carbonate caco3 more than 90 and minor calcium sulphate caso4 and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 the metallurgy in rtr med is mainly titanium tubes stainless steel 316 for distilled water pipes fiber glass and cemented pipes for brine water pipes and stainless steel smo 254 for the shells see figs 8 10 the descaling was completed by implementing two stages of chemical cleaning using 5 wt inhibited sulfamic acid and 5 wt inhibited ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta first sulfamic acid was circulated for 48 h and the samples were collected hourly the results were after that the edta was circulated for 48 h after drain the acid and do water wash in the unit the results were at the end of the second application of the process a total of 354 kg of scale were removed 234 kg of calcium sulphate and 120 kg of calcium carbonate the following pictures show the difference between before and after the chemical cleaning processes the first sample sample 1 in the picture above was taken in the beginning of the process sample 2 was taken after 12 h sample 3 was taken after 24 h and sample 4 was taken at the end of the cleaning process after 30 h the change in turbidity between the samples reflects the effectiveness of the cleaning process inside the unit the color of the entrained liquid in the second picture after completing the process shows that dirt and scale were removed from the unit see figs 11 14 after implementing all mentioned actions med production returned to the design capacity see figs 15 18 4 2 multi stage flash brine circulation see table 3 rtr msf brine heater and stages 1 12 were found plugged by hard scale calcium sulphate as a result the unit production decreased the scale formation and low production were investigated and the results the acid was circulated at 4 5 bar and the temperature was adjusted to 60 72 c the circulation is continued until hydrochloric acid concentration falls below 3 0 or if iron exceeds 10 000 mg l then the solution was drained see figs 19 21 3 neutralization solution of water with chloride content 50 ppm mixed with 0 5 1 0 w w soda was circulated for 1 h to neutralize the residual acid inside the system after implementing all mentioned actions rtr msf production returned to the design capacity 5 conclusions recommendations based on the resulted outputs and the earlier discussion and analysis it was concluded that desalination process is sensitive process where many factors can lead to performance reduction however thermal desalination process is easy to be maintained and restore its production capacity moreover it was noticed that one failure led to multi failures in the unit such as unadjusted spray nozzles in med led to heavy scale on the tubes tubes hot spots high temperature and then low performance in addition general actions are recommended to maintain thermal desalination unit production and minimize scale formation 1 improve unit monitoring by focusing on a maintaining top brine temperature tbt as per the design b maintaining make up flow rate on meds and

investigated and reported including the synthesis of copper ii complex 15 in addition getting rid of heavy metals and rare earths by the complexation action of α am ph was established and reported 16 18 nanomaterials have become very promising targets in many fields such as solar energy catalysis medicine and agriculture as well as water treatment from different wastes as dyes pesticides and heavy metals 19 20 recently removal of heavy elements by using divergent nanosorbents such as nanometal oxides and organic materials has become very interesting for many researchers getting rid of heavy metals from solution through adsorption is very effective because it is a low cost and short time technique 21 22 therefore adsorption of toxic heavy metals by using metal oxides is well denoted as an advanced technique for water treatment 23 in addition nano titanium oxide has been investigated as an effective sorbent owing to its chemical stability high surface reactivity and high density of surface atoms 24 lead and copper ions are known to exhibit high ability to accumulate in human body and animals and thus can cause severe diseases and disorders in the human body 25 26 removal of these two metals from different matrices using miscellaneous sorbents have been documented by a number of investigated materials including spherical agglomeration technique nano titanium oxide nano zinc oxide montmorillonite nano cellulose mixed with polyethyleneimine and the composite of polypyrrole carbon nanotube 27 28 additionally removal of divalent pb ions from aqueous solutions was

nanomaterials 49 52 to the best of our knowledge α am ph were not previously immobilized on the surface of nanometal oxide because they are known as good chelating compounds they were selected to functionalize the surface of nano tio2 to produce a novel nanocomposite n tio2 α am ph as an effective nanomaterial for removal of divalent pb cu ions from water the designed n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite is aimed to characterize by different techniques to evaluate the adsorption capability and behavior the major focus parameters in this study are aimed to compare the removal performance of pb cu ions from water onto the designed nanocomposite versus α am ph based on the optimization of a number of experimental controlling conditions 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals applied in this work possess a high assay and were implemented without any further chemical purification process as listed out with their specifications in table 1 2 2 instrumentations the outlined techniques and instrumentations to characterize both α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are illustrated in table 2 2 3 synthesis 2 3 1 synthesis of α am ph a simple efficient eco friendly method is proceeded to obtain α am ph based on a one pot reaction a three components reaction consisted of 4 0 g of benzaldehyde 5 697 g of benzyl carbamate and 11 695 g of triphenyl phosphite in the presence

and hr tem the synthetic route for this reaction is demonstrated in scheme 1 2 3 2 synthesis and immobilization of α am ph on the surface of nano titanium oxide n tio2 α am ph was prepared by using 1 0 mmol 0 473 g of α am ph in 2 0 ml ethanol and mixed with 1 0 g of n tio2 the reaction mixture was refluxed for 4 h filtered through fine particles filter paper and washed with diethyl ether finally n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite was dried at 50 60 c the proposed structure of n tio2 α am ph is demonstrated in scheme 1 2 4 extraction of divalent pb cu ions by the batch technique miscellaneous parameters were implemented to determine the extraction of divalent pb cu ions the controlling factors such as ph reaction time amount of nanocomposite ion concentration and interfering ions were measured using the batch technique according to the following procedures the ph parameter was conducted by using 25 0 1 mg of the nanocomposite in a flask 50 ml and mixed with 9 0 ml of diverse buffers ph 1 0 7 0 followed by the addition of 1 0 ml 0 1 mol l 1 of metal solution containing either divalent pb or cu ions and subjected to 30 min shaking at ambient temperature a filtration was executed and the filtrate was titrated with 0 01 mol l 1 of edta these steps were triplicated and the metal sorption capacity q was calculated from eq 1 to evaluate the removal efficiency 1 q co c v m aw of metal where q mg g metal adsorbed mg per dry nanocomposite g co and c mol l 1 primary concentration and residual concentration respectively v ml reaction volume and m g mass of nanocomposite and

obtained from the ph study the selected nanocomposite weight was mixed with 9 0 ml buffer and 1 0 ml 0 1 mol l 1 divalent pb or cu ions in a 50 0 ml flask the procedures were completed as listed above the ion concentration factor was checked using diverse concentration 0 1 2 0 ml of divalent pb or cu ions 0 1 mol l 1 by mixing with 25 0 1 mg of nanocomposite and 9 0 ml of buffer solution the contents were shaken well to the optimum time of each ion and the procedures were completed as listed above the amount of nanocomposite was checked during the discarding process of divalent pb cu with diverse masses 5 0 100 0 1 mg under the optimum ph and reaction time the selected nanocomposite weight was mixed with 9 0 ml buffer 1 0 ml 0 1 mol l 1 divalent pb or cu ions 50 0 ml flask the contents

nh4cl caso4 and mgso4 in presence of optimum buffer 9 0 ml and 1 0 ml 0 1 mol l 1 of divalent pb cu ions under the optimum reaction time and the procedures were completed as listed above the previous steps were reiterated for 3 times and performed as mentioned above and the metal capacity values were estimated from eq 1 2 5 water remediation of divalent pb cu via microcolumn technique tap water and industrial wastewater samples 100 0 ml were spiked to obtain 1 0 mg l 1 concentration of divalent pb or cu ions transferred through a micro column system packed with n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite 50 1 mg and allowed to flow with a rate 2 ml min 1 the primary and remaining concentrations of the examined metal ions were determined by atomic spectroscopy to identify the percentage recovery values according to eq 2 2 r co c co 100 where r the removal percentage co initial ionic concentration and c final ion concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the acquired ft ir spectra of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively in the frequency range 400 4000 cm 1 the ft ir spectrum of α am ph fig 1a is identified by some characteristic peaks at 3294 53 cm 1 for n h absorption 1705 13 cm 1 for co and 1512 24 cm 1 for c c stretching in aromatic ring a strong peak at 1222 91 cm 1 is related to po vibrations the peak at 952 87 cm 1 is assigned to the absorption of po ph a peak at 742 62 cm 1 is imputed to the absorption of p c 621 10 cm 1 is referred to aromatic sp2 ch 15 16 the ft ir spectrum of n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite is shown in fig 1b and characterized by the presence of nearly the same characteristic peaks of α am ph however the strong peak at 1222 91 cm 1 which is related to the po vibrations has been diminished and lowered to produce a weak peak at 1220 98 due to the possible participation of this functional group in bond formation with n tio2 the presence of nanotitanium oxide in the assembled n tio2 α am ph was detected by the peak at 507 30 cm 1 due to the ti o ti vibrations modes 19 thermal gravimetric analysis tga of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are illustrated in fig 1c and d respectively the thermogram of α am ph shows six degradation steps the first one at 28 59 124 59 c mass loss 1 58 and the second step at 124 59 194 34 c mass loss 2 94 to describe the volatalization of adsorbed water molecules from the surface of α am ph the third step at 194 34 274 81 c mass loss 43 89 illustrates the thermal degradation of p oph 2 with a mass loss extended to 43 89 from the initial sample mass the fourth step 274 81 370 54 c may be assigned to the thermal degradation of ph ch2 o with a mass loss 22 60 the fifth step 370 54 525 56 c and the sixth step 525 56 599 82 c refer to the loss of carbonyl group co on the other hand the tga of n tio2 α am ph appears in fig 1d with percentage loss values less than those related to α am ph due to high thermal stability of n tio2 α am ph via incorporation of n tio2 within the structure of this nanocomposite to confirm the successful synthesis of the target n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite xrd analyses of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are demonstrated in fig 1e and f respectively the sharp peaks at 2θ 9 86 17 04 and 19 33 are related to α am ph 15 16 in addition to the previous peaks there is a new series of observed peaks at 2θ 25 11 47 84 and 53 68 for n tio2 α am ph which are attributed to the tetragonal anatase phase of n tio2 19 the hr tem images of α am ph n tio2 α am ph and n tio2 were acquired by using 200 kv as represented in fig 1g h and i respectively the characterized particle size of α am ph is 458 18 nm while the hr tem image of n tio2 α am ph was illustrated with the distribution of average particle size in the range 75 35 153 55 nm to confirm the direct immobilization of α am ph molecules on the surface of n tio2 to form the aimed n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite 3 2 remediation of divalent pb cu ions from aqueous solutions 3 2 1 remediation under various phs the study of diverse phs in the remediation process of heavy elements is an essential step to conclude the element behavior during the remediation process the results of this study are shown in fig 2 a as graphed between the values of removal capacities mg g versus the ph of divalent pb or cu ions in solution the reactivity behaviors of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph were found to be highly dependent on the metal solution phs for example at ph 1 0 3 0 a competition between divalent pb or cu ions with the existing hydrogen ions was noticed as a result of the possible reaction of these hydrogen ions to protonate the oxygen and nitrogen atoms on the surfaces of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph 24 the extraction values of divalent pb at ph 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 were found 74 80 and 94 mg g using α am ph and 74 82 and 86 mg g using n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite for divalent cu ions the extraction values were 10 11 and 12 mg g using α am ph and 7 10 and 14 mg g by n tio2 α am ph as the surface losses protonation especially in presence of ph 7 0 the maximum removal efficiency values could be established as 253 mg g for pb and 187 mg g for cu by n tio2 α am ph while the maximum values using α am ph were characterized as 51 mg g and 50 mg g for divalent pb and cu respectively 24 3 2 2 remediation under different reaction times and kinetic studies the study of reaction time for adsorption of divalent pb cu ions by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph was also evaluated and the results are clarified in fig 2 b in which the extraction values mg g are plotted versus the reaction time min a gradual removal increasing order of divalent pb was characterized upon increasing the time from 1 min to 50 min using α am ph and form 1 min 60 min using n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite moreover the equilibrium conditions were obtained at 50 and 60 min with the removal values of divalent pb ions corresponding to 267 and 278 mg g using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively for divalent cu the removal values were 51 and 42 mg g at 30 and 60 min using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively to reach the condition of surface saturation and equilibrium 27 finally there was a decreasing order in the metal sorption values of divalent pb cu ions at higher reaction 50 60 min owing to the possible particles aggregation of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph four kinetic models were elaborated and encompassed pseudo first order represented by lagergren eq 3 pseudo second order eq 4 and intraparticle diffusion illustrated by weber and morris eq 5 in addition the elovich model expounded systems with heterogeneous surface and represented by eq 6 these models were evaluated and the different parameters were calculated and compared using the correlation coefficient r 2 to characterize the most valid model to describe the adsorption of divalent pb cu ions onto α am ph and n tio2 α am ph 51 the kinetic parameters for adsorption of divalent pb cu ions onto α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are listed out in table 3 according to the correlation coefficients r 2 divalent cu ions were appropriated to the pseudo second order reaction compared to other models using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph similarly the kinetics of divalent pb ions were appropriated to the pseudo second order model using the same two sorbents as well as good fitting with the pseudo first for α am ph and the intraparticle for n tio2 α am ph 3 ln q1 qt ln q1 k1t 4 t qt 1 k2q2 2 1 q2t 5 qt kpt1 2 c 6 qt 1 β ln α β 1 β ln 3 2 3 remediation under different masses the mass effect was investigated and illustrated in fig 2 c the removal trend decreased with increasing the nanocomposite amount from 5 mg to 100 mg for divalent pb ions the highest values of metal capacity were obtained using 5 0 mg as 439 and 453 mg g by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively while the lowest values were detected with 100 0 mg as 42 and 47 mg g respectively for divalent cu ions the highest removals were 225 and 257 mg g using 5 0 mg and the lowest removals were 63 and 14 mg g by 100 mg of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively this behavior in existence of low mass is referred to the presence of highly concentrated metal ions relative to the less active surface functional groups on the nanomaterials otherwise the low extraction values using the high masses are referred to the small abundance of functional groups relative to the number of metal ions 3 2 4 remediation under initial ionic concentration and adsorption isotherms different values of ionic concentrations from 0 2 to 2 0 ml of 0 1 mol l 1 of divalent pb and cu ions were used to investigate the adsorptive removal change by the action of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph as shown in fig 2 d the increasing in ionic concentration led to increasing the removal of divalent pb cu ions due to the direct effect on the mass transfer barrier between the sorbent and metal ion in solution the removal values of divalent pb cu were found to gradually increase with increasing the ionic concentration 0 2 2 0 ml of 0 1 mol l 1 the highest extracted divalent pb ions were obtained as 534 and 257 mg g while the highest extracted cu ions were 76 and 102 mg g by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively the study of adsorption isotherms can be employed to interpret the binding reaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate four models were evaluated in this study including langmuir freundlich temkin and d r 52 the theory of langmuir eq 7 assumed that the surface of solid is composed of elementary sites and the surface of solid is homogenous adsorption takes place without lateral interaction the freundlich model eq 8 is used for heterogeneous surface the temkin model eq 9 assumed that an inverse relationship between adsorption heat and adsorbent coverage the d r model eq 10 is generally implemented to observe the mechanism of adsorption adsorbent porosity and adsorption energy the adsorption of divalent pb cu ions were studied and evaluated by the previous four isotherm models and from the calculations of the correlation coefficient values r 2 the listed data in table 4 revealed good fittings with the four models for cu ions by using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph however in the case of pb ions α am ph were best suited with four models and n tio2 α am ph only fitted with langmuir 7 ce q e 1 q max k l ce q max 8 ln

the extraction of divalent pb cu ions as shown in fig 2 e to indicate that both pb and cu ions were found to demonstrate either decreasing or increasing order on their removal values by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph the decreasing or increasing in the extraction behaviors referred to the divergent interfering competition with divalent pb and cu ions in addition to the different chemistry of interfering ions with the interacting sorbent an increasing in the metal capacity of pb ions was evident in existence of divergent interfering ions using the two sorbents while the opposite manners were noticed for cu ions 3 3 application of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph for remediation of pb cu ions from water the investigated sorbents α am ph and n tio2 α am ph were implemented to remove 1 0 mg l 1 of divalent pb or cu ions spiked in tap water and industrial wastewater samples using microcolumn system packed with 25 1 mg of α am ph or n tio2 α am ph the results of this study refer to good recovery values for extraction of divalent pb cu ions from tap water and industrial wastewater as the removal processes were achieved by using three successive runs it is evident that the percentage extractions of divalent pb and cu ions are relatively higher in the case of n tio2 α am ph compared to α am ph for example the percentage recovery of divalent pb ions from tap water was found to be 90 and 92 using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively while the removal data from wastewater were 88 and 91 for the same sorbent materials in the same way the recovery values of divalent cu ions by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph were identified in the ranges 90 92 and 90 94 respectively 4 conclusion the newly evaluated n tio2 α am ph was found highly efficient nanocomposite for removal of heavy divalent pb cu ions from water compared to α am ph as well as previously reported materials table 5 the uptake by α am ph was enhanced by its covalent bond formation via immobilization on the surface

isotherm models water remediation 1 introduction α aminophosphonates α am ph are organophosphorous compounds with the formula ro 2 p o chr1nhr2 these compounds are structural analogues of natural amino acids in which a carboxylic group is replaced with a phosphonic acid ester moiety they are characterized by the presence of phosphonic acid ester group in the form of op or 2 1 aminophosphonates have a great importance in many fields and numerous potential applications in medicinal chemistry as enzyme inhibitor antitumor anticancer antibacterial anti inflammatory and antibiotics 2 3 in addition organophosphorous compounds exhibit biological activities on the ability of most mammalian cells which are containing some enzymes that hydrolyze phosphate group 4 6 α am ph are important due to their stability with such enzymes and their negligible mammalian cell toxicity 7 they are also effective in treatment of bone cancer 8 they play an important role in agriculture field as being plant growth regulators herbicides fungicides and good metal complexing toward metal ions 9 10 chemical features of aminophosphonates biodegradation and their importance in diverse fields were investigated 11 diverse methods have been studied for synthesis of α am ph as kabachnik mannich pudovik and microwave reactions 12 14 the ability of α am ph to form metal complexes was also investigated and reported including the synthesis of copper ii complex 15 in addition getting rid of heavy metals and rare earths by the complexation action of α am ph was established and reported 16 18 nanomaterials have become very promising targets in many fields such as solar energy catalysis medicine and agriculture as well as water treatment from different wastes as dyes pesticides and heavy metals 19 20 recently removal of heavy elements by using divergent nanosorbents such as nanometal oxides and organic materials has become very interesting for many researchers getting rid of heavy metals from solution through adsorption is very effective because it is a low cost and short time technique 21 22 therefore adsorption of toxic heavy metals by using metal oxides is well denoted as an advanced technique for water treatment 23 in addition nano titanium oxide has been investigated as an effective sorbent owing to its chemical stability high surface reactivity and high density of surface atoms 24 lead and copper ions are known to exhibit high ability to accumulate in human body and animals and thus can cause severe diseases and disorders in the human body 25 26 removal of these two metals from different matrices using miscellaneous sorbents have been documented by a number of investigated materials including spherical agglomeration technique nano titanium oxide nano zinc oxide montmorillonite nano cellulose mixed with polyethyleneimine and the composite of polypyrrole carbon nanotube 27 28 additionally removal of divalent pb ions from aqueous solutions was reported by the action of feni3 sio2 nanocomposite 29 bentonite 30 guar gum 31 nano titanium oxide nano zinc oxide 32 mofs 33 activated carbon produced from plant of caryota urens calcium alginate beads 34 and tannin resin combined with carbon nanotubes 35 furthermore a comparison for removal of divalent pb ions was reported by organo apatites from adipic acid citric acid and methylene triphosphonic acid and pure apatite 36 mercaptoamine coated with nanomaterials was also investigated to remove divalent pb ions from wastewater 37 other natural materials including some nanobiosorbents and nanocomposites were studied to uptake divalent pb ions as animal bone powder nile rose plant powder 38 nano cryptomelane 39 and other methodologies 40 45 in addition removal of copper ions from aqueous solutions was deliberated by using nanosized material composed of diborontrioxide titanium dioxide b2o3 tio2 46 kaolinite and montmorillonite 47 henna plant 48 and other nanomaterials 49 52 to the best of our knowledge α am ph were not previously immobilized on the surface of nanometal oxide because they are known as good chelating compounds they were selected to functionalize the surface of nano tio2 to produce a novel nanocomposite n tio2 α am ph as an effective nanomaterial for removal of divalent pb cu ions from water the designed n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite is aimed to characterize by different techniques to evaluate the adsorption capability and behavior the major focus parameters in this study are aimed to compare the removal performance of pb cu ions from water onto the designed nanocomposite versus α am ph based on the optimization of a number of experimental controlling conditions 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals applied in this work possess a high assay and were implemented without any further chemical purification process as listed out with their specifications in table 1 2 2 instrumentations the outlined techniques and instrumentations to characterize both α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are illustrated in table 2 2 3 synthesis 2 3 1 synthesis of α am ph a simple efficient eco friendly method is proceeded to obtain α am ph based on a one pot reaction a three components reaction consisted of 4 0 g of benzaldehyde 5 697 g of benzyl carbamate and 11 695 g of triphenyl phosphite in the presence

reaction as monitored by tlc a white precipitate was formed the product was obtained by decantation to afford the desired α am ph with high yield the product was characterized by using ft ir tga xrd and hr tem the synthetic route for this reaction is demonstrated in scheme 1 2 3 2 synthesis and immobilization of α am ph on the surface of nano titanium oxide n tio2 α am ph was prepared by using 1 0 mmol 0 473 g of α am ph in 2 0 ml ethanol and mixed with 1 0 g of n tio2 the reaction mixture was refluxed for 4 h filtered through fine particles filter paper and washed with diethyl ether finally n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite was dried at 50 60 c the proposed structure of n tio2 α am ph is demonstrated in scheme 1 2 4 extraction of divalent pb cu ions by the batch technique miscellaneous parameters were implemented to determine the extraction of divalent pb cu ions the controlling factors such as ph reaction time amount of nanocomposite ion concentration and interfering ions were measured using the batch technique according to the following procedures the ph parameter was conducted by using 25 0 1 mg of the nanocomposite in a flask 50 ml and mixed with 9 0 ml of diverse buffers ph 1 0 7 0 followed by the addition of 1 0 ml 0 1 mol l 1 of metal solution containing either divalent pb or cu ions and subjected to 30 min shaking at ambient temperature a filtration was executed and the filtrate was titrated with 0 01 mol l 1 of edta these steps were triplicated and the metal sorption capacity q was calculated from eq 1 to evaluate the removal efficiency 1 q co c v m

the ion concentration factor was checked using diverse concentration 0 1 2 0 ml of divalent pb or cu ions 0 1 mol l 1 by mixing with 25 0 1 mg of nanocomposite and 9 0 ml of buffer solution the contents were shaken well to the optimum time of each ion and the procedures were completed as listed above the amount of nanocomposite was checked during the discarding process of divalent pb cu with diverse masses 5 0 100 0 1 mg under the optimum ph and reaction time the selected nanocomposite weight was mixed with 9 0 ml buffer 1 0 ml 0 1 mol l 1 divalent pb or cu ions 50 0 ml flask the contents were shaken well and the procedures were completed as listed above the factor of interfering ions was tested by reaction of 25 0 1 mg of nanocomposite with 100 1 mg of the competing species nacl kcl nh4cl caso4 and mgso4 in presence of optimum buffer 9 0 ml and 1 0 ml 0 1 mol l 1 of divalent pb cu ions under the optimum reaction time and the procedures were completed as listed above the previous steps were reiterated for 3 times and performed as mentioned above and the metal capacity values were estimated from eq 1 2 5 water remediation of divalent pb cu via microcolumn technique tap water and industrial wastewater samples 100 0 ml were spiked to obtain 1 0 mg l 1 concentration of divalent pb or cu ions transferred through a micro column system packed with n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite 50 1 mg and allowed to flow with a rate 2 ml min 1 the primary and remaining concentrations of the examined metal ions were determined by atomic spectroscopy to identify the percentage recovery values according to eq 2 2 r co c co 100 where r the removal percentage co initial ionic concentration and c final ion concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the acquired ft ir spectra of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively in the frequency range 400 4000 cm 1 the ft ir spectrum of α am ph fig 1a is identified by some characteristic peaks at 3294 53 cm 1 for n h absorption 1705 13 cm 1 for co and 1512 24 cm 1 for c c stretching in aromatic ring a strong peak at 1222 91 cm 1 is related to po vibrations the peak at 952 87 cm 1 is assigned to the absorption of po ph a peak at 742 62 cm 1 is imputed to the absorption of p c 621 10 cm 1 is referred to aromatic sp2 ch 15 16 the ft ir spectrum of n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite is shown in fig 1b and characterized by the presence of nearly the same characteristic peaks of α am ph however the strong peak at 1222 91 cm 1 which is related to the po vibrations has been diminished and lowered to produce a weak peak at 1220 98 due to the possible participation of this functional group in bond formation with n tio2 the presence of nanotitanium oxide in the assembled n tio2 α am ph was detected by the peak at 507 30 cm 1 due to the ti o ti vibrations modes 19 thermal gravimetric analysis tga of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are illustrated in fig 1c and d respectively the thermogram of α am ph shows six degradation steps the first one at 28 59 124 59 c mass loss 1 58 and the second step at 124 59 194 34 c mass loss 2 94 to describe the volatalization of adsorbed water molecules from the surface of α am ph the third step at 194 34 274 81 c mass loss 43 89 illustrates the thermal degradation of p oph 2 with a mass loss extended to 43 89 from the initial sample mass the fourth step 274 81 370 54 c may be assigned to the thermal degradation of ph ch2 o with a mass loss 22 60 the fifth step 370 54 525 56 c and the sixth step 525 56 599 82 c refer to the loss of carbonyl group co on the other hand the tga of n tio2 α am ph appears in fig 1d with percentage loss values less than those related to α am ph due to high thermal stability of n tio2 α am ph via incorporation of n tio2 within the structure of this nanocomposite to confirm the successful synthesis of the target n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite xrd analyses of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are demonstrated in fig 1e and f respectively the sharp peaks at 2θ 9 86 17 04 and 19 33 are related to α am ph 15 16 in addition to the previous peaks there is a new series of observed peaks at 2θ 25 11 47 84 and 53 68 for n tio2 α am ph which are attributed to the tetragonal anatase phase of n tio2 19 the hr tem images of α am ph n tio2 α am ph and n tio2 were acquired by using 200 kv as represented in fig 1g h and i respectively the characterized particle size of α am ph is 458 18 nm while the hr tem image of n tio2 α am ph was illustrated with the distribution of average particle size in the range 75 35 153 55 nm to confirm the direct immobilization of α am ph molecules on the surface of n tio2 to form the aimed n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite 3 2 remediation of divalent pb cu ions from aqueous solutions 3 2 1 remediation under various phs the study of diverse phs in the remediation process of heavy elements is an essential step to conclude the element behavior during the remediation process the results of this study are shown in fig 2 a as graphed between the values of removal capacities mg g versus the ph of divalent pb or cu ions in solution the reactivity behaviors of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph were found to be highly dependent on the metal solution phs for example at ph 1 0 3 0 a competition between divalent pb or cu ions with the existing hydrogen ions was noticed as a result of the possible reaction of these hydrogen ions to protonate the oxygen and nitrogen atoms on the surfaces of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph 24 the extraction values of divalent pb at ph 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 were found 74 80 and 94 mg g using α am ph and 74 82 and 86 mg g using n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite for divalent cu ions the extraction values were 10 11 and 12 mg g using α am ph and 7 10 and 14 mg g by n tio2 α am ph as the surface losses protonation especially in presence of ph 7 0 the maximum removal efficiency values could be established as 253 mg g for pb and 187 mg g for cu by n tio2 α am ph while the maximum values using α am ph were characterized as 51 mg g and 50 mg g for divalent pb and cu respectively 24 3 2 2 remediation under different reaction times and kinetic studies the study of reaction time for adsorption of divalent pb cu ions by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph was also evaluated and the results are clarified in fig 2 b in which the extraction values mg g are plotted versus the reaction time min a gradual removal increasing order of divalent pb was characterized upon increasing the time from 1 min to 50 min using α am ph and form 1 min 60 min using n tio2 α am ph nanocomposite moreover the equilibrium conditions were obtained at 50 and 60 min with the removal values of divalent pb ions corresponding to 267 and 278 mg g using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively for divalent cu the removal values were 51 and 42 mg g at 30 and 60 min using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively to reach the condition of surface saturation and equilibrium 27 finally there was a decreasing order in the metal sorption values of divalent pb cu ions at higher reaction 50 60 min owing to the possible particles aggregation of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph four kinetic models were elaborated and encompassed pseudo first order represented by lagergren eq 3 pseudo second order eq 4 and intraparticle diffusion illustrated by weber and morris eq 5 in addition the elovich model expounded systems with heterogeneous surface and represented by eq 6 these models were evaluated and the different parameters were calculated and compared using the correlation coefficient r 2 to characterize the most valid model to describe the adsorption of divalent pb cu ions onto α am ph and n tio2 α am ph 51 the kinetic parameters for adsorption of divalent pb cu ions onto α am ph and n tio2 α am ph are listed out in table 3 according to the correlation coefficients r 2 divalent cu ions were appropriated to the pseudo second order reaction compared to other models using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph similarly the kinetics of divalent pb ions were appropriated to the pseudo second order model using the same two sorbents as well as good fitting with the pseudo first for α am ph and the intraparticle for n tio2 α am ph 3 ln q1 qt ln q1 k1t 4 t qt 1 k2q2 2 1 q2t 5 qt kpt1 2 c 6 qt 1 β ln α β 1 β ln 3 2 3 remediation under different masses the mass effect was investigated and illustrated in fig 2 c the removal trend decreased with increasing the nanocomposite amount from 5 mg to 100 mg for divalent pb ions the highest values of metal capacity were obtained using 5 0 mg as 439 and 453 mg g by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively while the lowest values were detected with 100 0 mg as 42 and 47 mg g respectively for divalent cu ions the highest removals were 225 and 257 mg g using 5 0 mg and the lowest removals were 63 and 14 mg g by 100 mg of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively this behavior in existence of low mass is referred to the presence of highly concentrated metal ions relative to the less active surface functional groups on the nanomaterials otherwise the low extraction values using the high masses are referred to the small abundance of functional groups relative to the number of metal ions 3 2 4 remediation under initial ionic concentration and adsorption isotherms different values of ionic concentrations from 0 2 to 2 0 ml of 0 1 mol l 1 of divalent pb and cu ions were used to investigate the adsorptive removal change by the action of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph as shown in fig 2 d the increasing in ionic concentration led to increasing the removal of divalent pb cu ions due to the direct effect on the mass transfer barrier between the sorbent and metal ion in solution the removal values of divalent pb cu were found to gradually increase with increasing the ionic concentration 0 2 2 0 ml of 0 1 mol l 1 the highest extracted divalent pb ions were obtained as 534 and 257 mg g while the highest extracted cu ions were 76 and 102 mg g by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively the study of adsorption isotherms can be employed to interpret the binding reaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate four models were evaluated in this study including langmuir freundlich temkin and d r 52 the theory of langmuir eq 7 assumed that the surface of solid is composed of elementary sites and the surface of solid is homogenous adsorption takes place without lateral interaction the freundlich model eq 8 is used for heterogeneous surface the temkin model eq 9 assumed that an inverse relationship between adsorption heat and adsorbent coverage the d r model eq 10 is generally implemented to observe the mechanism of adsorption adsorbent porosity and adsorption energy the adsorption of divalent pb cu ions were studied and evaluated by the previous four isotherm models and from the calculations of the correlation coefficient values r 2 the listed data in table 4 revealed good fittings with the four models for cu ions by using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph however in the case of pb ions α am ph were best suited with four models and n tio2 α am ph only fitted with langmuir 7 ce q e 1 q max k l ce q max 8 ln

the extraction of divalent pb cu ions as shown in fig 2 e to indicate that both pb and cu ions were found to demonstrate either decreasing or increasing order on their removal values by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph the decreasing or increasing in the extraction behaviors referred to the divergent interfering competition with divalent pb and cu ions in addition to the different chemistry of interfering ions with the interacting sorbent an increasing in the metal capacity of pb ions was evident in existence of divergent interfering ions using the two sorbents while the opposite manners were noticed for cu ions 3 3 application of α am ph and n tio2 α am ph for remediation of pb cu ions from water the investigated sorbents α am ph and n tio2 α am ph were implemented to remove 1 0 mg l 1 of divalent pb or cu ions spiked in tap water and industrial wastewater samples using microcolumn system packed with 25 1 mg of α am ph or n tio2 α am ph the results of this study refer to good recovery values for extraction of divalent pb cu ions from tap water and industrial wastewater as the removal processes were achieved by using three successive runs it is evident that the percentage extractions of divalent pb and cu ions are relatively higher in the case of n tio2 α am ph compared to α am ph for example the percentage recovery of divalent pb ions from tap water was found to be 90 and 92 using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively while the removal data from wastewater were 88 and 91 for the same sorbent materials in the same way the recovery values of divalent cu ions by α am ph and n tio2 α am ph were identified in the ranges 90 92 and 90 94 respectively 4 conclusion the newly evaluated n tio2 α am ph was found highly efficient nanocomposite for removal of heavy divalent pb cu ions from water compared to α am ph as well as previously reported materials table 5 the uptake by α am ph was enhanced by its covalent bond formation via immobilization on the surface of n tio2 due to possible participation of the two components in metal removal the maximum removal conditions of divalent pb cu ions were characterized at ph 7 0 30 60 min and 5 0 mg dosage the highest removal capacities values were achieved as 439 and 453 mg g for divalent pb ions while 225 and 257 mg g were detected for divalent cu by using α am ph and n tio2 α am ph respectively in addition it is also confirmed that the two sorbents were successfully employed as efficient water remediators for recovery of pb cu species with 88 92 pb ions and 90 94 cu ions from the evaluated

8809,the present study quantified the industrial water demand and reclamation and identified the scale of water intensive industries in jordan five industrial sectors including 395 industrial factories were surveyed by means of a structured questionnaire the gathered data that were assessed included all industrial sectors number of employees the types and quantities of products water demand wastewater generation quantities and management practices water demand and wastewater generation indicators the water use and wastewater generation per product or per worker or per time were determined for each of the responded groups of industrial sectors the total industrial water demand and effluents generation in the five industrial sectors were pragmatically extrapolated and calculated moreover the water reclamation and reuse potentialities were assessed from both environmental and economic perspectives the results showed that the monthly industrial water demand per worker is 0 634 m3 for domestic use while that for process use is varied between 0 07 to 21 38 m3 tons product the results also determined the wastewater generation indicators where the domestic use is generating between 0 515 to 0 628 m3 of wastewater per month per worker while that for process use is between 0 04 to 12 45 m3 tons product moreover the scenario of on site treatment of 90 of the generated wastewater to be used as alternative water for 37 83 of total process water demanded by the grouped industries showed viability where 9 7 million cubic meter of fresh water can be saved annually and at least 25 953 60 tons co2 equivalent emission can be reduced keywords industrial water wastewater water demand domestic use water indicators water reclamation jordan 1 introduction jordan is one of the most water deprived countries in terms of fresh water resources the situation is aggravated by climatic conditions geography and region s geopolitical environment 1 jordan is ranked second in the world in water scarcity 2 3 and is classified as being a semi arid region 4 5 notwithstanding the situation in jordan has been aggravated by a large influx of refugees which caused overexploitations of its resources 6 12 climate change has another adverse effect 13 ministry of water and irrigation mwi records shows that precipitation has decreased by 20 over the last eight decades 1 despite of severe water scarcity in jordan more than 94 of jordanians have access to safe drinking water and 93 have access to improved sanitation water demand far exceeds supply and water allocation is unbalanced with 51 9 going to irrigation 44 1 for municipal and 4 for industry 1 in this context jordan has given top priority to the use of reclaimed wastewater in agriculture and industrial sectors one of the most important issues about the industrial sector is that it mostly relies on fresh water which could be used for domestic purposes for instance the industry uses almost 4 of water i e 32 2 million m3 groundwater 4 8 million m3 surface water and 1 7 million m3 of treated wastewater 1 however water allocated for industrial development in different industrial sectors is sometimes insufficient it is noteworthy that in jordan it is generally accepted that water for industrial purposes has relatively a higher allocative efficiency than other uses i e tourism and agriculture for instance the financial return of water use in industry is 40jod m3 while each 1m3 of water use in industrial sector created 3 777 jobs opportunities according to the department of statistics dos 2014 1 industrial water demand includes the needs for water in industrial water use such as in manufacturing processes and operations power generation cooling and in domestic water use in industries such as in sewerage cleanup employees showering and washing up and sanitation etc notwithstanding the industrial water demand continues to increase in the face of a dire water shortage and the negative environmental impacts of industrial wastewater have yet to be fully realized by the jordan s industrial facilities although the industrial water demand in jordan will increase to 120 million cubic meter mcm by the year 2020 1 the industrial water management in different industrial sectors is not tackled in jordan s water strategy 2016 2025 yet moreover the lack of attention paid to this is not stated in any short medium and long term recommendations stated in any national strategy and policies therefore reliable data on industrial water demand and wastewater quantities is essential to avoid failure of their control and monitoring and are significant for water management and reclaimed water utilization options 14 15 unfortunately these needed data are lacking in many developing countries 16 and in many cases they are inconsistent if they are available and their estimates vary significantly 17 18 the present study helps to address this data gap by adopting a bottom up approach survey for estimating the water demand and wastewater generated by the industrial sector the bottom up approach is a vital tool that provides the most accurate information and gathers reliable data from an industrial facility 19 however due to its time consuming and confidentiality obstacles such approach is avoided 20 the present study adopts bottom up approach for creating water demand and wastewater generation profiles information for the industrial facilities in the grouped sectors the database that stemmed from such adopted approach provide statistics that form a baseline for water use and wastewater generation and subsequently can be updated on regular basis while tackling the technological upgrade in the production processes moreover eco efficiency measures can be investigated since the data include economic indicators as well to date there is no published literature that adopted such comprehensive approach for estimating industrial water demand and wastewater generation for different industrial scale facilities to industrial cluster and regions etc however as other adopted approaches the approach of the present study has assumed that the seasonal variation of industrial water use does not have significant effect of the estimations 17 21 therefore the objective of this research is to establish a contemporary inventory of water management in jordanian industries by quantifying the industrial water demand in jordan and subsequently highlighting the scale of water intensive industries the inventory will answer the questions how much water demand is needed there how much wastewater is generated there and what is the disposal practices and what industries consume generate it the findings of the present study helps to investigate the water viability for industrial symbiosis and beneficial reuse strategies 2 materials and methods the cross sectional survey was carried out throughout june to october 2019 and targeted 921 industries in jordan as shown in table 1 the selected industries were classified into five sectors namely agricultural and food chemical it engineering and electrical medical equipment and therapeutics and packaging industries the registered industrial facilities are represented by three chambers of industry in jordan amman chamber of industry aci represents seven cities in central and southern regions in jordan irbid chamber of industry ici represents three northern cities in jordan and zarqa chamber of industry zci represents mafraq and zarqa cities 22 the survey was conducted in consultation with the relevant stakeholders chambers of industry and other industry entities in order to select priority facilities in the aforementioned industrial sectors the structured questionnaire was designed and distributed through electronic means i e emails and google forms the designed questionnaire included some general information on the items such as industrial sector group location number of employees the water types and quantities it also contained some questions on disposal practices of wastewater as well as management activities wastewater treatment reuse and recycling etc the water management status of the respondent industries was investigated based on the gathered data which were analyzed using spss version 19 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 survey responses analysis according to table 1 most targeted industries in the present study were the it engineering and electrical industries 30 08 agricultural and food industries 29 32 followed by the packaging industries 19 65 chemical industries 15 09 in addition medical equipment and therapeutics industries were identified to be the least targeted industries in the present survey with 5 86 however the response rate was in the three chambers of industry aci 41 74 zci 45 03 and ici 52 08 3 2 water demand quantity water consumption depends not only on the size of the facility but mainly on the type of industry and its processes 23 a variation in water consumption was observed depending on the type of products manufactured in industrial sectors it was also noticed that according to the survey the industrial facilities which are employing pretreatment plants for fresh water generally consume more water than industrial facilities which do not table 2 showed the results of the total amounts of industrial water demand was 701957 m3 month where 2 95 of that is for domestic use and 97 05 for industrial process use however the most industrial water consuming sector was agricultural and food industries with 33 50 of the total monthly water demand followed by the chemical industries 32 61 and packaging industries 23 71 while it engineering and electrical industries and medical equipment and therapeutics industries were the least industrial water consuming sectors and approximately close to each other in terms of industrial water demand with 7 44 and 2 74 respectively the per worker domestic water use indicator shows more and less constant value 0 634 m3 per month per worker in the grouped industries as shown in table 2 for the total number of personnel in the targeted and surveyed industries was 32661 persons however the process water use per tons product shows large variation across industrial sectors as shown in table 2 ranging from 21 38 m3 tons product in medical equipment and therapeutics industries to 0 07 m3 tons product for it engineering and electrical industries with packaging industries 4 74 m3 tons product agricultural and food industries 1 53 m3 tons product and chemical industries 0 52 m3 tons product hence the largest process water consuming sector was the medical equipment and therapeutics industries with four folds more than the followed sector which was the packaging paper and plastic industries 3 3 wastewater generation quantity table 3 showed the results of the total amounts of industrial wastewater generation was 311 608 m3 month where 6 07 of that is generated from domestic use and 93 93 is from industrial process use however the most industrial wastewater generating sector was chemical industries with 38 56 of the total monthly generated wastewater followed by the agricultural and food industries 35 26 while the it engineering electrical industries and packaging industries were close to each other in terms of wastewater generation with 10 15 and 12 08 respectively the medical equipment and therapeutics industries was the least industrial wastewater generating sector with 3 95 as shown in the results of table 3 the per worker domestic water use indicator shows slight but remarkable variations across the grouped industries for instance chemical industries and agricultural and food industries were the highest and close to each other in terms of wastewater generation with 0 628 and 0 615 m3 worker month respectively followed by both of medical equipment and therapeutics industries and packaging industries with 0 586 and 0 563 m3 worker month while the least wastewater generator was the it engineering and electrical industries with 0 515 m3 worker month in the same analogy with water demand the wastewater generated from process use source per tons product shows large variation across industrial sectors as shown in table 3 ranging from 12 45 m3 tons product in medical equipment and therapeutics industries to 0 04 m3 tons product for it engineering and electrical industries with packaging industries 1 01 m3 tons product agricultural and food industries 0 69 m3 tons product and chemical industries 0 27 m3 tons product hence the largest wastewater generating sector was the medical equipment and therapeutics industries with four folds more than the followed sector which was the packaging paper and plastic industries 3 4 wastewater disposal practices according to the survey data the wastewater disposal practices were reported for each industry sector which includes direct discharge to sewers off site disposal on site treatment for both domestic and industrial wastewater recirculation and others i e roads cleaning industry ground washing etc based on the analysis results it is obvious from figure 1 that wastewater disposal practices and management varies depending on the type of the industry however the practice of on site treatment of wastewater was the most dominant practice conducted by the industries with 61 44 of total amount of wastewater generated as shown in table 4 this practice implies pretreatment of wastewater in the vicinity of the industry to comply with the imposed standard by the ministry of environment in jordan and subsequently pump the treated wastewater into the wastewater collection network for further treatment in the industrial park s wastewater treatment plant the highest percentages of the on site treatment of wastewater practice are present in chemical industries 86 23 and packaging industries 68 58 followed by both of medical equipment and therapeutics industries 48 27 agricultural and food industries 47 19 respectively which were close to each other the off site treatment practice was ranked second as a disposal practice among the grouped industries with wastewater amount of 49 471 m3 month as shown in table 4 it has the highest percentage in agricultural and food industries 29 05 medical equipment and therapeutics industries 21 19 and then followed by packaging industries 12 77 and it engineering and electrical industries industries 10 91 respectively the direct discharge of wastewater to sewers practice 36 061 m3 month has the highest percentages in it engineering and electrical industries 54 19 medical equipment and therapeutics industries 15 07 and agricultural and food industries 9 22 respectively it is also observed that 4 025 m3 month of wastewater was recirculated within the industry process i e for cooling towers etc the wastewater recirculation practice was noticed and only reported in the packaging industries 8 10 and in the it engineering and electrical industries 1 50 respectively however the other practices of wastewater was reported in the grouped industries with varied percentages in it engineering and electrical industries 19 96 medical equipment and therapeutics industries 15 47 and agricultural and food industries 14 13 packaging industries 7 11 and chemical industries 3 47 respectively 3 5 on site wastewater treatment and reuse enviro economic analysis the total amounts of annual water demand and wastewater generation in the whole industries can be calculated based on the real number of industries in each sector annual production capacities number of employees in each industrial sector and the water indicators tables 2 and 3 accordingly the number of employees in each industrial sector was obtained from the jci taking 2015 as a basis year of data which is 93030 workers while this number of workers is broken down in terms of each industrial sector as shown in table 5 based on that and in addition to the water demand and wastewater generation indicators listed in tables 2 and 3 and the annual extrapolated production capacities of the grouped industries the annual water and wastewater in whole industries in jordan are estimated to equal 26 406 845 cubic meter per year and 12 530 580 cubic meter per year respectively as shown in table 5 since the reclamation of treated municipal wastewater is being widely considered to meet specific water quality criteria for a range of beneficial reuse purposes 24 hence a scenario is proposed in the present study that 90 of the generated wastewater amount 12 530 580 m3 can be on site treated to meet the water standard for process water use application accordingly approximately 9 720 450 m3 can be reclaimed for industrial use which represents 37 83 of total process water demanded by the grouped industries 25 695 978 m3 in return this can help in carbon emission reduction since it is reported that 2 67 kg co2 equivalent is emitted when treating one cubic meter of wastewater 13 therefore at least 25 953 60 tons co2 equivalent emission can be reduced annually by the aforementioned scenario as well as 9 7 million cubic meter of fresh water can be saved annually the financial analysis of such proposed scenario shows viable savings based on the costs of fresh water purchase by the industry which is jod1 m3 1 4 m3 and the cost paid by the industry for wastewater treatment which is jod0 7 m3 1 m3 on average the total expected revenues will be approximately jod16 6 million 23 6 million per year taking into consideration that this financial analysis excludes the opportunity costs and environmental values of water savings however a cost benefit analysis of such scenario needs more investigation considering environmental externalities and resource availability parameters that should be incorporated 25 26 however it is worth mentioning that water resources are available for most of industries with relatively affordable cost especially for small scale industries where the price of a one cubic meter is between jod0 25 private wells jod1 supplied from government but no sewage connection jod1 5 supplied from government with sanitation and jod2 purchased water from wells not owned by the factory with these prices compared to the overall production costs for different industries it was evident that the monthly water bill is not a financial burden on the grouped industries consequently many industries within the different surveyed sectors indicated low interest in water saving quantities of discharged wastewater are a function of water consumption in each industry 27 these quantities were found insignificant generally in those who consume small quantities of water thus industries would usually focus on discharging those quantities of wastewater rather than treating and reusing them for irrigation or other purposes therefore internal and external strategies shall be imposed to reducing sewage discharge and improving water reuse to address the high industrial water use 28 4 conclusion the present study estimated the industrial water demand and reclamation in jordan by conducting a cross sectional survey in several industrial sectors the estimation included water demand and wastewater generation quantities and indicators for each of grouped industrial sectors as well as environmental and economic analysis was conducted to investigate the water reclamation and reuse potentialities it was concluded from the present study that industrial water demand and effluents for process use depend on industry type and its processes however an average of 0 634 m3 per month per worker was calculated as a constant indicator for water demand for domestic use with negligible variation among the grouped industrial sectors however the wastewater generation per worker domestic use indicator showed slight but remarkable variations across the grouped industries moreover the total industrial water demand and effluents generation in the five industrial sectors was pragmatically extrapolated and calculated based on the currently existing number of workers and the production capacity thus it was indicated that the majority of industrial wastewater came from chemical industries followed by the agricultural and food industries notwithstanding 37 83 of the total process water demanded by the grouped industries can be potentially reclaimed after on site treatment of generated wastewater consequently this will lead to benefit savings and profit of 23 6 million per year and 25 953 60 tons co2 equivalent emission reduction credit authorship contribution statement motasem n saidan

8809,the present study quantified the industrial water demand and reclamation and identified the scale of water intensive industries in jordan five industrial sectors including 395 industrial factories were surveyed by means of a structured questionnaire the gathered data that were assessed included all industrial sectors number of employees the types and quantities of products water demand wastewater generation quantities and management practices water demand and wastewater generation indicators the water use and wastewater generation per product or per worker or per time were determined for each of the responded groups of industrial sectors the total industrial water demand and effluents generation in the five industrial sectors were pragmatically extrapolated and calculated moreover the water reclamation and reuse potentialities were assessed from both environmental and economic perspectives the results showed that the monthly industrial water demand per worker is 0 634 m3 for domestic use while that for process use is varied between 0 07 to 21 38 m3 tons product the results also determined the wastewater generation indicators where the domestic use is generating between 0 515 to 0 628 m3 of wastewater per month per worker while that for process use is between 0 04 to 12 45 m3 tons product moreover the scenario of on site treatment of 90 of the generated wastewater to be used as alternative water for 37 83 of total process water demanded by the grouped industries showed viability where 9 7 million cubic meter of fresh water can be saved annually and at least 25 953 60 tons co2 equivalent emission can be reduced keywords industrial water wastewater water demand domestic use water indicators water reclamation jordan 1 introduction jordan is one of the most water deprived countries in terms of fresh water resources the situation is aggravated by climatic conditions geography and region s geopolitical environment 1 jordan is ranked second in the world in water scarcity 2 3 and is classified as being a semi arid region 4 5 notwithstanding the situation in jordan has been aggravated by a large influx of refugees which caused overexploitations of its resources 6 12 climate change has another adverse effect 13 ministry of water and irrigation mwi records shows that precipitation has decreased by 20 over the last eight decades 1 despite of severe water scarcity in jordan more than 94 of jordanians have access to safe drinking water and 93 have access to improved sanitation water demand far exceeds supply and water allocation is unbalanced with 51 9 going to irrigation 44 1 for municipal and 4 for industry 1 in this context jordan has given top priority to the use of reclaimed wastewater in agriculture and industrial sectors one of the most important issues about the industrial sector is that it mostly relies on fresh water which could be used for domestic purposes for instance the industry uses almost 4 of water i e 32 2 million m3 groundwater 4 8 million m3 surface water and 1 7 million m3 of treated wastewater 1 however water allocated for industrial development in different industrial sectors is sometimes insufficient it is noteworthy that in jordan it is generally accepted that water for industrial purposes has relatively a higher allocative efficiency than other uses i e tourism and agriculture for instance the financial return of water use in industry is 40jod m3 while each 1m3 of water use in industrial sector created 3 777 jobs opportunities according to the department of statistics dos 2014 1 industrial water demand includes the needs for water in industrial water use such as in manufacturing processes and operations power generation cooling and in domestic water use in industries such as in sewerage cleanup employees showering and washing up and sanitation etc notwithstanding the industrial water demand continues to increase in the face of a dire water shortage and the negative environmental impacts of industrial wastewater have yet to be fully realized by the jordan s industrial facilities although the industrial water demand in jordan will increase to 120 million cubic meter mcm by the year 2020 1 the industrial water management in different industrial sectors is not tackled in jordan s water strategy 2016 2025 yet moreover the lack of attention paid to this is not stated in any short medium and long term recommendations stated in any national strategy and policies therefore reliable data on industrial water demand and wastewater quantities is essential to avoid failure of their control and monitoring and are significant for water management and reclaimed water utilization options 14 15 unfortunately these needed data are lacking in many developing countries 16 and in many cases they are inconsistent if they are available and their estimates vary significantly 17 18 the present study helps to address this data gap by adopting a bottom up approach survey for estimating the water demand and wastewater generated by the industrial sector the bottom up approach is a vital tool that provides the most accurate information and gathers reliable data from an industrial facility 19 however due to its time consuming and confidentiality obstacles such approach is avoided 20 the present study adopts bottom up approach for creating water demand and wastewater generation profiles information for the industrial facilities in the grouped sectors the database that stemmed from such adopted approach provide statistics that form a baseline for water use and wastewater generation and subsequently can be updated on regular basis while tackling the technological upgrade in the production processes moreover eco efficiency measures can be investigated since the data include economic indicators as well to date there is no published literature that adopted such comprehensive approach for estimating industrial water demand and wastewater generation for different industrial scale facilities to industrial cluster and regions etc however as other adopted approaches the approach of the present study has assumed that the seasonal variation of industrial water use does not have significant effect of the estimations 17 21 therefore the objective of this research is to establish a contemporary inventory of water management in jordanian industries by quantifying the industrial water demand in jordan and subsequently highlighting the scale of water intensive industries the inventory will answer the questions how much water demand is needed there how much wastewater is generated there and what is the disposal practices and what industries consume generate it the findings of the present study helps to investigate the water viability for industrial symbiosis and beneficial reuse strategies 2 materials and methods the cross sectional survey was carried out throughout june to october 2019 and targeted 921 industries in jordan as shown in table 1 the selected industries were classified into five sectors namely agricultural and food chemical it engineering and electrical medical equipment and therapeutics and packaging industries the registered industrial facilities are represented by three chambers of industry in jordan amman chamber of industry aci represents seven cities in central and southern regions in jordan irbid chamber of industry ici represents three northern cities in jordan and zarqa chamber of industry zci represents mafraq and zarqa cities 22 the survey was conducted in consultation with the relevant stakeholders chambers of industry and other industry entities in order to select priority facilities in the aforementioned industrial sectors the structured questionnaire was designed and distributed through electronic means i e emails and google forms the designed questionnaire included some general information on the items such as industrial sector group location number of employees the water types and quantities it also contained some questions on disposal practices of wastewater as well as management activities wastewater treatment reuse and recycling etc the water management status of the respondent industries was investigated based on the gathered data which were analyzed using spss version 19 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 survey responses analysis according to table 1 most targeted industries in the present study were the it engineering and electrical industries 30 08 agricultural and food industries 29 32 followed by the packaging industries 19 65 chemical industries 15 09 in addition medical equipment and therapeutics industries were identified to be the least targeted industries in the present survey with 5 86 however the response rate was in the three chambers of industry aci 41 74 zci 45 03 and ici 52 08 3 2 water demand quantity water consumption depends not only on the size of the facility but mainly on the type of industry and its processes 23 a variation in water consumption was observed depending on the type of products manufactured in industrial sectors it was also noticed that according to the survey the industrial facilities which are employing pretreatment plants for fresh water generally consume more water than industrial facilities which do not table 2 showed the results of the total amounts of industrial water demand was 701957 m3 month where 2 95 of that is for domestic use and 97 05 for industrial process use however the most industrial water consuming sector was agricultural and food industries with 33 50 of the total monthly water demand followed by the chemical industries 32 61 and packaging industries 23 71 while it engineering and electrical industries and medical equipment and therapeutics industries were the least industrial water consuming sectors and approximately close to each other in terms of industrial water demand with 7 44 and 2 74 respectively the per worker domestic water use indicator shows more and less constant value 0 634 m3 per month per worker in the grouped industries as shown in table 2 for the total number of personnel in the targeted and surveyed industries was 32661 persons however the process water use per tons product shows large variation across industrial sectors as shown in table 2 ranging from 21 38 m3 tons product in medical equipment and therapeutics industries to 0 07 m3 tons product for it engineering and electrical industries with packaging industries 4 74 m3 tons product agricultural and food industries 1 53 m3 tons product and chemical industries 0 52 m3 tons product hence the largest process water consuming sector was the medical equipment and therapeutics industries with four folds more than the followed sector which was the packaging paper and plastic industries 3 3 wastewater generation quantity table 3 showed the results of the total amounts of industrial wastewater generation was 311 608 m3 month where 6 07 of that is generated from domestic use and 93 93 is from industrial process use however the most industrial wastewater generating sector was chemical industries with 38 56 of the total monthly generated wastewater followed by the agricultural and food industries 35 26 while the it engineering electrical industries and packaging industries were close to each other in terms of
