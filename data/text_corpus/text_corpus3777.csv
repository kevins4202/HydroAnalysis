18885,a novel iron cycling process based on core shell iron granules which contained zero valent iron fe0 in the core and maghemite γ fe2o3 on the shell fe0 feiii granules was proposed to in situ control hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of the polluted urban rivers the fe0 feiii granules added in the top sediment layer removed 97 of sulfide generated by sulfate reducing bacteria in the sediments and the sulfide removal capacity of virgin granules was 163 mg s g fe 114 mg s g granule the fe0 feiii granules removed the formed sulfide through the abiotic sulfide oxidation and precipitation and they also stimulated the microbial iron reduction which competitively consumed wastewater derived organics and partially inhibited the sulfate reduction in the sediments the used fe0 feiii granules were easily regenerated through magnetic separation from sediments and air exposure for 12 h which enhanced the sulfide removal capacities of the regenerated granules by 12 22 compared to the virgin granules during the air exposure ferrous products i e iron sulfide and surface associated feii on the granule shell were completely oxidized to poorly ordered feiii hydroxides γ feooh and amorphous feooh having larger specific surface areas and higher reactivity to sulfide than γ fe2o3 on the virgin granules meanwhile the fe0 in the core was also partially oxidized through the indirect electron transfer which was facilitated by the electrically conductive iron oxide minerals fe3o4 and fe2o3 and the microbial electron carriers e g geobacter the oxidation of fe0 core contributed additional feiii hydroxides to the sulfide control the fe0 feiii granules were reused for four times in a 293 day trial and their overall sulfide removal capacity was at least 920 mg s g fe the proposed iron cycling process can be a chemical saving energy saving and cost effective approach for the hydrogen sulfide control in the sediments of polluted urban rivers as well as lakes aquaculture ponds and marine graphical abstract image 1 keywords sediment hydrogen sulfide fe0 feiii granules microbial iron reduction magnetic separation indirect electron transfer 1 introduction the build up and emissions of hydrogen sulfide h2s in the sediments of the polluted urban rivers as well as lakes aquaculture ponds and marine have been a long recognized problem in the world daghio et al 2018 richards and pallud 2016 wiener et al 2006 in these aqueous systems organics from the untreated or partially treated domestic and industrial wastewater often accumulate in the sediments where hydrogen sulfide is generated via the microbial sulfate reduction sheng et al 2013 sun et al 2013 hydrogen sulfide causes odor nuisance and poses adverse effects on aquatic organisms jiang et al 2017 kim et al 2012 liang et al 2019 and it also reacts with metals mainly iron to form metal sulfides which results in the blackening of urban waters wang et al 2014 recently hydrogen sulfide has been considered as a key pollutant in blackened and odorous waters in china sheng et al 2012 wang et al 2014 therefore the effective control of hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of these aqueous systems is urgent and necessary several remediation strategies such as aeration and soluble chemical injection for the hydrogen sulfide control in the sediment systems have been examined sheng et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 however the aeration technique requires the installation of localized equipment and intensive energy consumption the soluble chemicals e g hydrogen peroxide and iron salts dosed in sediments can be easily released into the water phase before reacting with hydrogen sulfide because hydrogen sulfide is often slowly generated in such systems yin et al 2018a furthermore soluble chemicals are one off and cannot be reused the iron cycling process based on granular iron hydr oxides has been demonstrated to be a long lasting and renewable approach for the in situ control of hydrogen sulfide in the sediment systems our previous studies found that ferric feiii hydr oxide granules including granular ferric hydroxide β feooh and granular ferric oxide α feooh persistently retained in the sediments and converted the slowly generated hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur s0 and iron sulfide precipitates fes s sun et al 2013 2014 the used granules recovered their sulfide removal capacities after providing dissolved oxygen do or chemical oxidants to oxidize the ferrous feii products back into feiii hydr oxides poulton et al 2002 yin et al 2018a unlike dosing soluble chemicals such as iron salts which are easily released into the water phase the addition and reuse of solid feiii hydr oxides minimize the chemical release lahav et al 2004 however the do supply via continuously mechanical mixing or aeration for iron granule regeneration in the sediment systems is difficult and energy intensive due to the low aqueous solubility of oxygen ma et al 2006 the iron regeneration via the injection of chemical oxidants increases the chemical costs yin et al 2018a a more chemical saving and energy saving iron cycling process based on magnetic iron granules having the core shell structure fe0 feiii granules was thus proposed fe0 feiii granules which contain magnetic zero valent iron fe0 in the core and feiii hydr oxides on the shell can be generated through rusting iron granules or recycled from the waste iron crusts in metal processing industries yin et al 2018b the used fe0 feiii granules after the exhaustion of feiii hydr oxides on the shell are magnetically separated from the sediments and exposed to air to allow the oxidation of feii products on the used granules by oxygen it is anticipated that the magnetically mediated regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules would significantly reduce chemical costs and energy consumption of the hydrogen sulfide control in sediments however the feasibility of this novel iron cycle process is still unknown furthermore the in situ hydrogen sulfide control by fe0 feiii granules in sediments and the regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules involve complex biochemical mechanisms further investigations are needed to address the following aspects 1 the influences of fe0 feiii granules on the biochemical processes in the river sediments are not clear the abiotic reactions of feiii hydr oxides with dissolved sulfide are well documented in the literature peiffer et al 1992 poulton et al 2004 however the in situ control of hydrogen sulfide generated by sulfate reducing bacteria srb in sediments may also involve the biotic pathways such as the inhibition of sulfate reduction by feiii hydr oxides king 1990 lovley and phillips 1987 2 the iron and sulfur transformations during the regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules have not been investigated the oxidation of surface feii products on the granule shell by do may result in the formation of feiii hydr oxides having different crystal structures and surface properties from those on the virgin granules cornell and schwertmann 2003 poulton et al 2004 reported that the reactivity of feiii hydr oxides towards dissolved sulfide was significantly correlated with their crystal structures and surface area in addition fe0 in the granule core may be oxidized by do during the regeneration and additional feiii hydr oxides could be produced and serve for the hydrogen sulfide control these transformations are anticipated to influence the hydrogen sulfide control performances of fe0 feiii granules during the repeated use in this study fe0 feiii granules were prepared from the waste iron granules and the feasibility of regenerating fe0 feiii granules through magnetic separation and air exposure for the control of hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of polluted urban rivers was investigated the influences of fe0 feiii granules on the biochemical processes in the sediments were evaluated the transformations of iron and sulfur species during the repeated regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules were also explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials unless otherwise

experiments were conducted to evaluate the hydrogen sulfide control performances of the virgin and regenerated fe0 feiii granules in the sediments of the polluted rivers a bench scale reactor system was constructed to simulate the urban rivers in the pearl river delta which are often heavily polluted by domestic wastewater sheng et al 2012 as shown in fig s 1 the reactor 40 cm in length 10 cm in width and 20 cm in height was filled with 4 l sediment samples 10 cm in height the synthetic wastewater containing 35 mg s l sulfate and 50 mg c l organic carbon 133 5 mg cod l was continuously pumped into the reactor at a flow rate of 4 ml min and at 25 c water flowing over the sediment surface was circulated at a flow rate of 136 ml min to provide a well mixed condition influent and effluent

feiii granules was evenly placed over the sediment surface to provide a dosage of 500 g granule m2 sediment the dosage of fe0 feiii granules was determined by the preliminary tests when the dissolved sulfide concentrations exceeded 0 5 mg s l the sulfide removal capacity of fe0 feiii granules was operationally considered being used up a control reactor without feiii fe0 granule addition was also constructed for a comparison the sulfide removal capacity of fe0 feiii granules was calculated from the cumulative amounts of sulfide that were removed to regenerate the used fe0 feiii granules a

sediments the magnet plate was exposed in the atmosphere for 12 h h to allow the oxidation of the used fe0 feiii granules by oxygen the regenerated fe0 feiii granules were collected and placed back on the top of sediments to evaluate their reuse performance in the same manner aforementioned 2 2 2 analysis of sulfide sulfate and toc in sediment pore water to reveal the depth profiles of dissolved

characterizations of virgin fe0 feiii granules the physical and chemical properties of the virgin fe0 feiii granules were characterized fig s 2a shows that one peak at 710 2 ev was identified in the fe 2p3 2 orbital spectrum of the fe0 feiii granules 0 nm surface which indicates the presence of feiii in the form of iron oxides fe2o3 on the fe0 feiii granule surface nefedov et al 1977 zhu et al 2013 the xrd pattern further shows that the fe2o3 formed was maghemite crystal γ fe2o3 jcpds no 00 004 0755 fig s 2b maghemite should be generated from the oxidation of the fe0 granule surface during the exposure to the do containing water howie 1998 the xps depth profile analysis fig s 2a reveals that feiii fe2o3 and mixed feii feiii in the form of fe3o4 were identified at 710 2 and 709 ev respectively after etching 20 nm shell by argon etching brainard and wheeler 1978 chen et al 2018 in addition to fe2o3 and fe3o4 fe0 was identified at 708 ev at the depth of 100 nm shabanova and trapeznikov 1975 xiao et al 2015 the results demonstrate that the oxidation of fe0 granule led to the production of the fe0 feiii granules having the core shell structure the fe0 in the core and iron oxides maghemite and magnetite on the shell gave the fe0 feiii granules a saturation magnetization of 107 emu g fig s 2c which allows their efficient magnetic separation from the sediments meanwhile the iron oxides on the shell provided a porous structure which has a specific surface area of 26 3 m2 g and a large amount of reactive surface sites for the sulfide control 3 2 hydrogen sulfide control by virgin and regenerated fe0 feiii granules in sediments the hydrogen sulfide control performances of the virgin and regenerated fe0 feiii granules in the river sediments were evaluated in a 293 d trial fig 1 a shows that the virgin fe0 feiii granules added on the sediment top decreased the dissolved sulfide concentrations in the effluents to less than 0 5 mg s l which were about 97 lower than those in the control without iron addition after 25 d the sulfide concentrations rapidly rebounded to the level of the control around 16 mg s l because the capacity of fe0 feiii granules was used up the sulfide removal capacity of the virgin granules was calculated as 114 mg s g granule 163 mg s g fe fig 1b which was 24 200 higher than those of granular β feooh and α feooh used in our previous studies sun et al 2013 yin et al 2018a interestingly the capacities of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules in the four reuse cycles were 129 138 mg s g granule fig 1b which were 12 22 higher than that of virgin ones p 0 05 the results demonstrate that the regeneration through magnetic separation from sediments and air exposure well recovered the sulfide removal capacities of the used fe0 feiii granules the better sulfide control performance of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules may be due to the oxidation of feii products e g fes on the shell and also fe0 in the granule core to highly reactive feiii hydr oxides during the regeneration sun et al 2014 the detailed transformations of iron and sulfur species during the repeated regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules will be discussed in section 3 4 this proposed iron cycling process can be a superior approach for the hydrogen sulfide control in the sediments of the polluted urban rivers compared to the use of soluble iron salts that are widely used in practice ganigue et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 the overall sulfide removal capacity of the fe0 feiii granules in the five use cycles tested was at least 0 92 g s g fe 0 644 g s g granule which was 1 5 2 1 times of the sulfide removal capacities of iron salts 0 43 g s g fe2 or 0 6 g s g fe3 used in the sewers firer et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 the estimated material cost of the proposed process to remove 1 kg sulfide was 0 22 0 43 which was 88 98 lower than that of iron salt addition 3 4 11 6 kg sulfide considering the unit prices of iron granules 0 2 0 4 kg fe from alibaba com and iron salts 2 5 kg fe from alibaba com it should be noted that no significant decrease in the sulfide removal capacity was observed during the four reuse cycles tested and the fe0 feiii granules could be further regenerated and reused therefore the overall material cost is expected to further decrease with the times of subsequent reuse more importantly the magnetically mediated regeneration of fe0 feiii granules did not involve the use of soluble chemical oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide which was used to regenerate granular iron hydr oxides yin et al 2018a the chemical consumption and the adverse impacts on the surrounding aquatic ecosystems caused by the potential chemical release are minimized in the real practice the electromagnets instead of permanent magnets can be employed to separate the used fe0 feiii granules for example the electromagnets can be placed on a belt type rotatory equipment on a boat that slowly moves across the rivers and the fe0 feiii granules could be continuously separated from the sediments and exposed in the atmosphere for regeneration the electricity consumption for the fe0 feiii granule separation is anticipated to be much lower than the continuous mechanical mixing for granular feiii hydr oxide regeneration used in our past studies sun et al 2013 2014 therefore this iron cycling process can be a cost effective energy saving and environmentally friendly solution to the sulfide control in the sediments of polluted urban rivers and other systems such as lakes marine and aquaculture ponds kim et al 2012 lahav et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 3 3 influences of fe0 feiii granules on the biochemical processes in sediments 3 3 1 inhibition of microbial sulfate reduction by fe0 feiii granules our previous studies have demonstrated that the feiii hydr oxide granules dosed in the sediment systems remove dissolved sulfide through chemical oxidation and precipitation eqs 1 3 leading to the formation of s0 surface associated feii f e ii and fes s sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 yin et al 2018a 1 hs 2 f e iii 2 fe ii s 0 h 2 f e ii f e 2 aq 3 f e 2 aq hs fes s h in addition to the abiotic conversion of the formed sulfide the fe0 feiii granules dosed in the sediments may also inhibit the sulfate reduction through stimulating the microbial iron reduction as illustrated by the proposed mechanisms in fig 2 fig 3 a shows that the concentrations of sulfate in the effluents of the reactor with the addition of fe0 feiii granules on the sediment top were significantly higher than those in effluents of the control reactor p 0 05 the fe0 feiii granule addition thus decreased the sulfate reduction by about 30 compared to the control meanwhile the addition of iron granules did not change the toc consumption p 0 05 fig 3b the inhibition of sulfate reduction was also supported by the depth profiles of dissolved sulfide in the sediment pore water the maximum concentration of dissolved sulfide in the pore water of the control sediments was about 20 mg s l at the depth of 5 mm and the concentration gradually decreased to 11 mg s l at the depth of 45 mm fig 4 fe0 feiii granules added on the top of sediments decreased the dissolved sulfide concentrations to less than 0 5 mg s l at 0 20 mm below the interface interestingly the sulfide concentrations still remained at the low levels of 2 4 mg s l at 20 45 mm which were much lower than those in the control case the differences suggest that the fe0 feiii granules inhibited the microbial sulfate reduction in the middle and bottom sediment layers which is further supported by the higher sulfate concentrations in the pore water of iron added sediments compared to the control case fig s 3a the microbial iron reduction stimulated by fe0 feiii granules can competitively consume the organics taking acetate as an example eq 4 lovley and phillips 1987 lovley 1997 and inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction 4 8 feooh ch 3 cooh 2 h 2 o irb 8 f e 2 aq 2 co 2 16 oh the concentrations of toc and acetate in the pore water of the iron added sediments in the middle 20 60 mm and bottom 60 100 mm layers were 14 72 lower than those without iron addition p 0 05 fig s 3b and s 3c acetate which should be mainly derived from the wastewater is one of the most favorable electron donors for both irb and srb lovley 1987 liamleam and annachhatre 2007 therefore the microbial iron reduction that occurs in the top sediment layer with fe0 feiii granules suppresses the sulfate reduction in the sediments through competitively consuming the wastewater derived organics 3 3 2 changes in the microbial community compositions the microbial community compositions in the sediments 20 d after the addition of fe0 feiii granules were analyzed to ascertain the influences of fe0 feiii granules on the biochemical processes in the sediments the rarefaction analysis shows that the diversity of the microbial community was well represented by the sequencing depth of the sediment samples collected fig s 4a at the genus level the addition of fe0 feiii granules induced the significant changes in the microbial community compositions fig s 4b as shown in fig 5 three obligate sulfate reducing genera desulforhabdus desulfomicrobium and desulfococcus three obligate iron reducing genera clostridium geobacter and pseudomonas and three facultative sulfate iron reducing genera desulfobacter desulfobulbus and desulfovibrio were identified in the control sediments hao et al 2014 lovley 1991 the fe0 feiii granule addition increased the relative abundances of iron reducing genera obligate facultative by 53 220 in the top layer of sediments and almost did not change in the middle and bottom layers meanwhile the relative abundances of obligate sulfate reducing genera slightly increased less than 18 in the top layer and decreased by 10 25 in the middle and bottom layers the results confirm that the fe0 feiii granules stimulated the microbial iron reduction in the top sediment layer while inhibited the sulfate reduction in the middle and bottom sediment layers it is worth noticing that the significant growth of both iron reducing and sulfate reducing genera was observed on the surface of fe0 feiii granules and their abundances were 25 56 higher than those in the top layer of bulk sediments fig 5 this may be attributable to the enrichment of wastewater derived organics on the fe0 feiii granules through adsorption because iron hydr oxides e g fe2o3 have affinities towards various organics such as acetate and ethanol carlos cuellar et al 2003 the adsorption of organics from the bulk water phase onto the shell of fe0 feiii granules further enhances the microbial iron reduction in the top sediment layer 3 4 iron and sulfur transformations during regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules 3 4 1 proposed mechanisms for the oxidation of surface feii compounds and core fe0 during regeneration the better sulfide control performance of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules than the virgin granules can be due to the oxidation of the surface feii products and the core fe0 and the formation of highly reactive feiii hydr oxides during the magnetically mediated regeneration the mechanisms of iron and sulfur transformations during the magnetically mediated regeneration of the used fe0 feiii granules were proposed in fig 6 the transformations of surface iron and sulfur species during the first use cycle of fe0 feiii granules were evaluated fig 7 shows the changes in the concentrations of the feiii s0 and avs on the virgin used and regenerated fe0 feiii granules which were indicated by their relative mass ratios to the total iron the relative mass ratio of feiii on the used fe0 feiii granules decreased from 0 28 to 0 12 and the ratios of avs and s0 increased significantly the results suggest that feiii was consumed and avs in the form of fes s s0 and other feii products e g surface associated feii were concurrently formed on the granule surface during the reactions of surface γ fe2o3 with dissolved sulfide eqs 1 3 and the microbial iron reduction eq 4 sun et al 2014 yin et al 2018a these surface feii and sulfur products were also identified in the xps spectra of the used fe0 feiii granules fig s 5 fig 7 also shows that after the regeneration the ratio of feiii increased to a similar level to the virgin granules the ratio of avs decreased to almost zero while the ratio of s0 increased by around 100 these changes demonstrate that the feii products on the surface of the used granules were oxidized by oxygen during the air exposure resulting in the formation of feiii and s0 eqs 5 and 6 sun et al 2014 yin et al 2018a 5 f e ii o 2 fe iii 6 fes o 2 f e iii s 0 the fe 2p3 2 and s 2p orbital xps spectra of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules reinforce the oxidation of surface feii products and the formation of feiii hydr oxides in the form of fe2o3 710 2 ev and feooh 711 3 ev fig s 5 by referring to the xrd patterns fig 8 a the formed feiii hydr oxides were maghemite γ fe2o3 00 004 0755 and iron oxide hydroxide feooh 01 089 6096 crystals compared to maghemite on the virgin granules iron oxide hydroxide which was newly formed from the oxidation of feii compounds had less ordered crystal structure cornell and schwertmann 2003 the less ordered feiii hydr oxides are known to have a higher specific surface area and reactivity towards dissolved sulfide than the ordered ones poulton et al 2004 the regenerated granules were also found to have a higher specific surface area 23 compared to the virgin ones fig s 6 therefore the formation of less ordered feooh from the surface feii oxidation was one important contributor to the better sulfide control performance of regenerated granules to probe the composition changes of the granule core during the regeneration the xps depth profile analysis was employed and the results are shown in fig s 7 the relative ratios of various iron species identified at the depth of 0 20 and 100 nm were calculated by peak fitting as shown in fig 8b the ratios of feiii hydr oxides fe2o3 feooh of the regenerated granules at the depth of 20 and 100 nm were 25 110 higher while the ratio of fe0 at 100 nm was 48 lower compared to those of the virgin granules the results suggest that a portion of fe0 in the core was also oxidized into fe2o3 and feooh during the regeneration eq 7 7 fe 0 o 2 f e iii the oxidation of the fe0 core by oxygen may proceed through the indirect electron transfer because the direct contact would be blocked by the granule shell as proposed in fig 6 the electron transfer from the core fe0 to oxygen at the granule surface can be mediated by electrically conductive iron oxide minerals and also microbial electron carriers fe2o3 and fe3o4 which were identified on the shell of fe0 feiii granules using the xps depth profile analysis fig s 7 are the electrically conductive minerals they are able to spontaneously transfer electrons from the fe0 core to the surface feiii to form surface associated feii due to the lower work function of fe0 4 5 ev than that of feiii oxides 5 6 ev ai et al 2013 subsequently the formed feii at the granule surface is oxidized to feiii through single electron transfer to oxygen the oxidation of the core fe0 through the electron transfer has been reported during the reactions of the core shell fe0 fe2o3 particles with oxidants such as chromate and hydrogen peroxide ai et al 2013 mu et al 2015 the electron transfer via certain microbial electron carriers is another possible pathway for the oxidation of the core fe0 by oxygen fig 6 although there was no direct physical contact between the core fe0 and the oxygen at the surface the indirect electron transfer may also be mediated by certain bacteria for example geobacter and shewanella have the capability of the extracellular electron transfer to other species of microbes or ultimate acceptors e g oxygen and iron oxides via electron carriers such as c type cytochromes and microbial nanowires pili reardon and mueller 2013 shi et al 2016 considering the porous structure of the shell of the fe0 feiii granules geobacter which was identified on the fe0 feiii granules fig 5 could inhabit inside the porous structure of the granule shell and can mediate the indirect transfer of electrons from the core fe0 to the feiii hydr oxides and oxygen at the surface via electron carriers the oxidation of the fe0 core during the regeneration of the used fe0 feiii granules was thus another important contributor to the better sulfide control performance of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules it is worth noticing that a portion of fes s formed during the sulfide control were deposited on the sediment particles instead of the fe0 feiii granule surface which is shown by the increases in the concentrations of total iron and avs in the top layer of sediments after the first exhaustion of fe0 feiii granule fig s 8 according to the increases in the concentration of total iron in the top layer the fe loss in the first use cycle can be calculated to be 1 g which was only 7 of total amount of fe added 14 g although this portion of lost fe could not be oxidized back into feiii hydr oxides and serve for the sulfide control in the subsequent reuse cycle the oxidation of the fe0 core and the formation of poorly ordered feooh highly reactive towards sulfide can offset the iron loss and enhance the sulfide control performance of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules 3 4 2 transformations of fe0 feiii granules during repeated regeneration the transformations of the granule shell and the fe0 core of the fe0 feiii granules in the four regeneration cycles was also evaluated the changes in the crystal structure of the feiii hydr oxides on the granule shell are displayed in fig 8a after the fourth regeneration the major feiii hydr oxide crystal on the granule surface was lepidocrocite γ feooh 00 044 1415 the low crystallinity shown by the xrd pattern also suggests the co existence of amorphous feooh γ feooh and amorphous feooh are much less ordered than γ fe2o3 on the virgin granules and iron oxide hydroxide on the granules after the first regeneration cornell and schwertmann 2003 and they can provide a large surface area fig s 6 and have high reactivity with sulfide poulton et al 2004 the changes in the granule core of the fe0 feiii granules were characterized using the xps depth profile analysis and the progressive oxidation of the fe0 core in the four regeneration cycles was observed fig 8b after the fourth regeneration the calculated ratios of feiii at the depth of 20 and 100 nm increased by 10 35 compared to those after the first regeneration therefore the gradual oxidation of fe0 in the core together with the crystal transformation of feiii hydr oxides from ordered ones into poorly ordered ones on the granule shell during the regeneration well explain the enhanced sulfide control performances of the fe0 feiii granules during repeated reuse in addition we also found that the saturation magnetization of the fe0 feiii granules within the four regeneration cycles did not decrease significantly less than 14 fig 8c the results indicate that the gradual oxidation of the magnetic fe0 core during the repeated regeneration would not affect the efficiency of magnetic separation 4 conclusions the fe0 feiii granules added in the top layer of sediments removed 97 of sulfide generated by srb in the river sediments and the sulfide removal capacity of virgin granules was 163 mg s g fe 114 mg s g granule the fe0 feiii granules removed the formed sulfide through the abiotic sulfide oxidation and precipitation and they also stimulated the microbial iron reduction

18885,a novel iron cycling process based on core shell iron granules which contained zero valent iron fe0 in the core and maghemite γ fe2o3 on the shell fe0 feiii granules was proposed to in situ control hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of the polluted urban rivers the fe0 feiii granules added in the top sediment layer removed 97 of sulfide generated by sulfate reducing bacteria in the sediments and the sulfide removal capacity of virgin granules was 163 mg s g fe 114 mg s g granule the fe0 feiii granules removed the formed sulfide through the abiotic sulfide oxidation and precipitation and they also stimulated the microbial iron reduction which competitively consumed wastewater derived organics and partially inhibited the sulfate reduction in the sediments the used fe0 feiii granules were easily regenerated through magnetic separation from sediments and air exposure for 12 h which enhanced the sulfide removal capacities of the regenerated granules by 12 22 compared to the virgin granules during the air exposure ferrous products i e iron sulfide and surface associated feii on the granule shell were completely oxidized to poorly ordered feiii hydroxides γ feooh and amorphous feooh having larger specific surface areas and higher reactivity to sulfide than γ fe2o3 on the virgin granules meanwhile the fe0 in the core was also partially oxidized through the indirect electron transfer which was facilitated by the electrically conductive iron oxide minerals fe3o4 and fe2o3 and the microbial electron carriers e g geobacter the oxidation of fe0 core contributed additional feiii hydroxides to the sulfide control the fe0 feiii granules were reused for four times in a 293 day trial and their overall sulfide removal capacity was at least 920 mg s g

aquaculture ponds and marine graphical abstract image 1 keywords sediment hydrogen sulfide fe0 feiii granules microbial iron reduction magnetic separation indirect electron transfer 1 introduction the build up and emissions of hydrogen sulfide h2s in the sediments of the polluted urban rivers as well as lakes aquaculture ponds and marine have been a long recognized problem in the world daghio et al 2018 richards and pallud 2016 wiener et al 2006 in these aqueous systems organics from the untreated or partially treated domestic and industrial wastewater often accumulate in the sediments where hydrogen sulfide is generated via the microbial sulfate reduction sheng et al 2013 sun et al 2013 hydrogen sulfide causes odor nuisance and poses adverse effects on aquatic organisms jiang et al 2017 kim et al 2012 liang et al 2019 and it also reacts with metals mainly iron to form metal sulfides which results in the blackening of urban waters wang et al 2014 recently hydrogen sulfide has been considered as a key pollutant in blackened and odorous waters in china sheng et al 2012 wang et al 2014 therefore the effective control of hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of these aqueous systems is urgent and necessary several remediation strategies such as aeration and soluble chemical injection for the hydrogen sulfide control in the sediment systems have been examined sheng et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 however the aeration technique requires the installation of localized equipment and intensive energy consumption the soluble chemicals e g hydrogen peroxide and iron salts dosed in sediments can be easily released into the water phase before reacting with hydrogen sulfide because hydrogen sulfide is often slowly generated in such systems yin et al 2018a furthermore soluble chemicals are one off and cannot be reused the iron cycling process based on granular iron hydr oxides has been demonstrated to be a long lasting and renewable approach for the in situ control of hydrogen sulfide in the sediment systems our previous studies found that ferric feiii hydr oxide granules including granular ferric hydroxide β feooh and granular ferric oxide α feooh persistently retained in the sediments and converted the slowly generated hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur s0 and iron sulfide precipitates fes s sun et al 2013 2014 the used granules recovered their sulfide removal capacities after providing dissolved oxygen do or chemical oxidants to oxidize the ferrous feii products back into feiii hydr oxides poulton et al 2002 yin et al 2018a unlike dosing soluble chemicals such as iron salts which are easily released into the water phase the addition and reuse of solid feiii hydr oxides minimize the chemical release lahav et al 2004 however the do supply via continuously mechanical mixing or aeration for iron granule regeneration in the sediment systems is difficult and energy intensive due to the low aqueous solubility of oxygen ma et al 2006 the iron regeneration via the injection of chemical oxidants increases the chemical costs yin et al 2018a a more chemical saving and energy saving iron cycling process based on magnetic iron granules having the core shell structure fe0 feiii granules was thus proposed fe0 feiii granules which contain magnetic zero valent iron fe0 in the core and feiii hydr oxides on the shell can be generated through rusting iron granules or recycled from the waste iron crusts in metal processing industries yin et al 2018b the used fe0 feiii granules after the exhaustion of feiii hydr oxides on the shell are magnetically separated from the sediments and exposed to air to allow the oxidation of feii products on the used granules by oxygen it is anticipated that the magnetically mediated regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules would significantly reduce chemical costs and energy consumption of the hydrogen sulfide control in sediments however the feasibility of this novel iron cycle process is still unknown furthermore the in situ hydrogen sulfide control by fe0 feiii granules in sediments and the regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules involve complex biochemical mechanisms further investigations are needed to address the following aspects 1 the influences of fe0 feiii granules on the biochemical processes in the river sediments are not clear the abiotic reactions of feiii hydr oxides with dissolved sulfide are well documented in the literature peiffer et al 1992 poulton et al 2004 however the in situ control of hydrogen sulfide generated by sulfate reducing bacteria srb in sediments may also involve the biotic pathways such as the inhibition of sulfate reduction by feiii hydr oxides king 1990 lovley and phillips 1987 2 the iron and sulfur transformations during the regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules have not been investigated the oxidation of surface feii products on the granule shell by do may result in the formation of feiii hydr oxides having different crystal structures and surface properties from those on the virgin granules cornell and schwertmann 2003 poulton et al 2004 reported that the reactivity of feiii hydr oxides towards dissolved sulfide was significantly correlated with their crystal structures and surface area in addition fe0 in the granule core may be oxidized by do during the regeneration and additional feiii hydr oxides could be produced and serve for the hydrogen sulfide control these transformations are anticipated to influence the hydrogen sulfide control performances of fe0 feiii granules during the repeated use in this study fe0 feiii granules were prepared from the waste iron granules and the feasibility of regenerating fe0 feiii granules through magnetic separation and air exposure for the control of hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of polluted urban rivers was investigated the influences of fe0 feiii granules on the biochemical processes in the sediments were evaluated the transformations of iron and sulfur species during the repeated regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules were also explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials unless otherwise

experiments were conducted to evaluate the hydrogen sulfide control performances of the virgin and regenerated fe0 feiii granules in the sediments of the polluted rivers a bench scale reactor system was constructed to simulate the urban rivers in the pearl river delta which are often heavily polluted by domestic wastewater sheng et al 2012 as shown in fig s 1 the reactor 40 cm in length 10 cm in width and 20 cm in height was filled with 4 l sediment samples 10 cm in height the synthetic wastewater containing 35 mg s l sulfate and 50 mg c l organic carbon 133 5 mg cod l was continuously pumped into the reactor at a flow rate of 4 ml min and at 25 c water flowing over the sediment surface was circulated at a flow rate of 136 ml min to provide a well mixed condition influent and effluent samples were collected on a daily basis and immediately subjected to the analyses of ph dissolved sulfide sulfate and total organic carbon toc after the sulfide formation remained stable 20 g fe0 feiii granules was evenly placed over the sediment surface to provide a dosage of 500 g granule m2 sediment the dosage of fe0 feiii granules was determined by the preliminary tests when the dissolved sulfide concentrations exceeded 0 5 mg s l the sulfide removal capacity of fe0 feiii granules was operationally considered being used up a control reactor without feiii fe0 granule addition was also constructed for a comparison the sulfide removal capacity of fe0 feiii granules was calculated from the cumulative amounts of sulfide that were removed to regenerate the used fe0 feiii granules a

sediments the magnet plate was exposed in the atmosphere for 12 h h to allow the oxidation of the used fe0 feiii granules by oxygen the regenerated fe0 feiii granules were collected and placed back on the top of sediments to evaluate their reuse performance in the same manner aforementioned 2 2 2 analysis of sulfide sulfate and toc in sediment pore water to reveal the depth profiles of dissolved

characterizations of virgin fe0 feiii granules the physical and chemical properties of the virgin fe0 feiii granules were characterized fig s 2a shows that one peak at 710 2 ev was identified in the fe 2p3 2 orbital spectrum of the fe0 feiii granules 0 nm surface which indicates the presence of feiii in the form of iron oxides fe2o3 on the fe0 feiii granule surface nefedov et al 1977 zhu et al 2013 the xrd pattern further shows that the fe2o3 formed was maghemite crystal γ fe2o3 jcpds no 00 004 0755 fig s 2b maghemite should be generated from the oxidation of the fe0 granule surface during the exposure to the do containing water howie 1998 the xps depth profile analysis fig s 2a reveals that feiii fe2o3 and mixed feii feiii in the form of fe3o4 were identified at 710 2 and 709 ev respectively after etching 20 nm shell by argon etching brainard and wheeler 1978 chen et al 2018 in addition to fe2o3 and fe3o4 fe0 was identified at 708 ev at the depth of 100 nm shabanova and trapeznikov 1975 xiao et al 2015 the results demonstrate that the oxidation of fe0 granule led to the production of the fe0 feiii granules having the core shell structure the fe0 in the core and iron oxides maghemite and magnetite on the shell gave the fe0 feiii granules a saturation magnetization of 107 emu g fig s 2c which allows their efficient magnetic separation from the sediments meanwhile the iron oxides on the shell provided a porous structure which has a specific surface area of 26 3 m2 g and a large amount of reactive surface sites for the sulfide control 3 2 hydrogen sulfide control by virgin and regenerated fe0 feiii granules in sediments the hydrogen sulfide control performances of the virgin and regenerated fe0 feiii granules in the river sediments were evaluated in a 293 d trial fig 1 a shows that the virgin fe0 feiii granules added on the sediment top decreased the dissolved sulfide concentrations in the effluents to less than 0 5 mg s l which were about 97 lower than those in the control without iron addition after 25 d the sulfide concentrations rapidly rebounded to the level of the control around 16 mg s l because the capacity of fe0 feiii granules was used up the sulfide removal capacity of the virgin granules was calculated as 114 mg s g granule 163 mg s g fe fig 1b which was 24 200 higher than those of granular β feooh and α feooh used in our previous studies sun et al 2013 yin et al 2018a interestingly the capacities of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules in the four reuse cycles were 129 138 mg s g granule fig 1b which were 12 22 higher than that of virgin ones p 0 05 the results demonstrate that the regeneration through magnetic separation from sediments and air exposure well recovered the sulfide removal capacities of the used fe0 feiii granules the better sulfide control performance of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules may be due to the oxidation of feii products e g fes on the shell and also fe0 in the granule core to highly reactive feiii hydr oxides during the regeneration sun et al 2014 the detailed transformations of iron and sulfur species during the repeated regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules will be discussed in section 3 4 this proposed iron cycling process can be a superior approach for the hydrogen sulfide control in the sediments of the polluted urban rivers compared to the use of soluble iron salts that are widely used in practice ganigue et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 the overall sulfide removal capacity of the fe0 feiii granules in the five use cycles tested was at least 0 92 g s g fe 0 644 g s g granule which was 1 5 2 1 times of the sulfide removal capacities of iron salts 0 43 g s g fe2 or 0 6 g s g fe3 used in the sewers firer et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 the estimated material cost of the proposed process to remove 1 kg sulfide was 0 22 0 43 which was 88 98 lower than that of iron salt addition 3 4 11 6 kg sulfide considering the unit prices of iron granules 0 2 0 4 kg fe from alibaba com and iron salts 2 5 kg fe from alibaba com it should be noted that no significant decrease in the sulfide removal capacity was observed during the four reuse cycles tested and the fe0 feiii granules could be further regenerated and reused therefore the overall material cost is expected to further decrease with the times of subsequent reuse more importantly the magnetically mediated regeneration of fe0 feiii granules did not involve the use of soluble chemical oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide which was used to regenerate granular iron hydr oxides yin et al 2018a the chemical consumption and the adverse impacts on the surrounding aquatic ecosystems caused by the potential chemical release are minimized in the real practice the electromagnets instead of permanent magnets can be employed to separate the used fe0 feiii granules for example the electromagnets can be placed on a belt type rotatory equipment on a boat that slowly moves across the rivers and the fe0 feiii granules could be continuously separated from the sediments and exposed in the atmosphere for regeneration the electricity consumption for the fe0 feiii granule separation is anticipated to be much lower than the continuous mechanical mixing for granular feiii hydr oxide regeneration used in our past studies sun et al 2013 2014 therefore this iron cycling process can be a cost effective energy saving and environmentally friendly solution to the sulfide control in the sediments of polluted urban rivers and other systems such as lakes marine and aquaculture ponds kim et al 2012 lahav et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 3 3 influences of fe0 feiii granules on the biochemical processes in sediments 3 3 1 inhibition of microbial sulfate reduction by fe0 feiii granules our previous studies have demonstrated that the feiii hydr oxide granules dosed in the sediment systems remove dissolved sulfide through chemical oxidation and precipitation eqs 1 3 leading to the formation of s0 surface associated feii f e ii and fes s sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 yin et al 2018a 1 hs 2 f e iii 2 fe ii s 0 h 2 f e ii f e 2 aq 3 f e 2 aq hs fes s h in addition to the abiotic conversion of the formed sulfide the fe0 feiii granules dosed in the sediments may also inhibit the sulfate reduction through stimulating the microbial iron reduction as illustrated by the proposed mechanisms in fig 2 fig 3 a shows that the concentrations of sulfate in the effluents of the reactor with the addition of fe0 feiii granules on the sediment top were significantly higher than those in effluents of the control reactor p 0 05 the fe0 feiii granule addition thus decreased the sulfate reduction by about 30 compared to the control meanwhile the addition of iron granules did not change the toc consumption p 0 05 fig 3b the inhibition of sulfate reduction was also supported by the depth profiles of dissolved sulfide in the sediment pore water the maximum concentration of dissolved sulfide in the pore water of the control sediments was about 20 mg s l at the depth of 5 mm and the concentration gradually decreased to 11 mg s l at the depth of 45 mm fig 4 fe0 feiii granules added on the top of sediments decreased the dissolved sulfide concentrations to less than 0 5 mg s l at 0 20 mm below the interface interestingly the sulfide concentrations still remained at the low levels of 2 4 mg s l at 20 45 mm which were much lower than those in the control case the differences suggest that the fe0 feiii granules inhibited the microbial sulfate reduction in the middle and bottom sediment layers which is further supported by the higher sulfate concentrations in the pore water of iron added sediments compared to the control case fig s 3a the microbial iron reduction stimulated by fe0 feiii granules can competitively consume the organics taking acetate as an example eq 4 lovley and phillips 1987 lovley 1997 and inhibit the microbial sulfate reduction 4 8 feooh ch 3 cooh 2 h 2 o irb 8 f e 2 aq 2 co 2 16 oh the concentrations of toc and acetate in the pore water of the iron added sediments in the middle 20 60 mm and bottom 60 100 mm layers were 14 72 lower than those without iron addition p 0 05 fig s 3b and s 3c acetate which should be mainly derived from the wastewater is one of the most favorable electron donors for both irb and srb lovley 1987 liamleam and annachhatre 2007 therefore the microbial iron reduction that occurs in the top sediment layer with fe0 feiii granules suppresses the sulfate reduction in the sediments through competitively consuming the wastewater derived organics 3 3 2 changes in the microbial community compositions the microbial community compositions in the sediments 20 d after the addition of fe0 feiii granules were analyzed to ascertain the influences of fe0 feiii granules on the biochemical processes in the sediments the rarefaction analysis shows that the diversity of the microbial community was well represented by the sequencing depth of the sediment samples collected fig s 4a at the genus level the addition of fe0 feiii granules induced the significant changes in the microbial community compositions fig s 4b as shown in fig 5 three obligate sulfate reducing genera desulforhabdus desulfomicrobium and desulfococcus three obligate iron reducing genera clostridium geobacter and pseudomonas and three facultative sulfate iron reducing genera desulfobacter desulfobulbus and desulfovibrio were identified in the control sediments hao et al 2014 lovley 1991 the fe0 feiii granule addition increased the relative abundances of iron reducing genera obligate facultative by 53 220 in the top layer of sediments and almost did not change in the middle and bottom layers meanwhile the relative abundances of obligate sulfate reducing genera slightly increased less than 18 in the top layer and decreased by 10 25 in the middle and bottom layers the results confirm that the fe0 feiii granules stimulated the microbial iron reduction in the top sediment layer while inhibited the sulfate reduction in the middle and bottom sediment layers it is worth noticing that the significant growth of both iron reducing and sulfate reducing genera was observed on the surface of fe0 feiii granules and their abundances were 25 56 higher than those in the top layer of bulk sediments fig 5 this may be attributable to the enrichment of wastewater derived organics on the fe0 feiii granules through adsorption because iron hydr oxides e g fe2o3 have affinities towards various organics such as acetate and ethanol carlos cuellar et al 2003 the adsorption of organics from the bulk water phase onto the shell of fe0 feiii granules further enhances the microbial iron reduction in the top sediment layer 3 4 iron and sulfur transformations during regeneration and reuse of fe0 feiii granules 3 4 1 proposed mechanisms for the oxidation of surface feii compounds and core fe0 during regeneration the better sulfide control performance of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules than the virgin granules can be due to the oxidation of the surface feii products and the core fe0 and the formation of highly reactive feiii hydr oxides during the magnetically mediated regeneration the mechanisms of iron and sulfur transformations during the magnetically mediated regeneration of the used fe0 feiii granules were proposed in fig 6 the transformations of surface iron and sulfur species during the first use cycle of fe0 feiii granules were evaluated fig 7 shows the changes in the concentrations of the feiii s0 and avs on the virgin used and regenerated fe0 feiii granules which were indicated by their relative mass ratios to the total iron the relative mass ratio of feiii on the used fe0 feiii granules decreased from 0 28 to 0 12 and the ratios of avs and s0 increased significantly the results suggest that feiii was consumed and avs in the form of fes s s0 and other feii products e g surface associated feii were concurrently formed on the granule surface during the reactions of surface γ fe2o3 with dissolved sulfide eqs 1 3 and the microbial iron reduction eq 4 sun et al 2014 yin et al 2018a these surface feii and sulfur products were also identified in the xps spectra of the used fe0 feiii granules fig s 5 fig 7 also shows that after the regeneration the ratio of feiii increased to a similar level to the virgin granules the ratio of avs decreased to almost zero while the ratio of s0 increased by around 100 these changes demonstrate that the feii products on the surface of the used granules were oxidized by oxygen during the air exposure resulting in the formation of feiii and s0 eqs 5 and 6 sun et al 2014 yin et al 2018a 5 f e ii o 2 fe iii 6 fes o 2 f e iii s 0 the fe 2p3 2 and s 2p orbital xps spectra of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules reinforce the oxidation of surface feii products and the formation of feiii hydr oxides in the form of fe2o3 710 2 ev and feooh 711 3 ev fig s 5 by referring to the xrd patterns fig 8 a the formed feiii hydr oxides were maghemite γ fe2o3 00 004 0755 and iron oxide hydroxide feooh 01 089 6096 crystals compared to maghemite on the virgin granules iron oxide hydroxide which was newly formed from the oxidation of feii compounds had less ordered crystal structure cornell and schwertmann 2003 the less ordered feiii hydr oxides are known to have a higher specific surface area and reactivity towards dissolved sulfide than the ordered ones poulton et al 2004 the regenerated granules were also found to have a higher specific surface area 23 compared to the virgin ones fig s 6 therefore the formation of less ordered feooh from the surface feii oxidation was one important contributor to the better sulfide control performance of regenerated granules to probe the composition changes of the granule core during the regeneration the xps depth profile analysis was employed and the results are shown in fig s 7 the relative ratios of various iron species identified at the depth of 0 20 and 100 nm were calculated by peak fitting as shown in fig 8b the ratios of feiii hydr oxides fe2o3 feooh of the regenerated granules at the depth of 20 and 100 nm were 25 110 higher while the ratio of fe0 at 100 nm was 48 lower compared to those of the virgin granules the results suggest that a portion of fe0 in the core was also oxidized into fe2o3 and feooh during the regeneration eq 7 7 fe 0 o 2 f e iii the oxidation of the fe0 core by oxygen may proceed through the indirect electron transfer because the direct contact would be blocked by the granule shell as proposed in fig 6 the electron transfer from the core fe0 to oxygen at the granule surface can be mediated by electrically conductive iron oxide minerals and also microbial electron carriers fe2o3 and fe3o4 which were identified on the shell of fe0 feiii granules using the xps depth profile analysis fig s 7 are the electrically conductive minerals they are able to spontaneously transfer electrons from the fe0 core to the surface feiii to form surface associated feii due to the lower work function of fe0 4 5 ev than that of feiii oxides 5 6 ev ai et al 2013 subsequently the formed feii at the granule surface is oxidized to feiii through single electron transfer to oxygen the oxidation of the core fe0 through the electron transfer has been reported during the reactions of the core shell fe0 fe2o3 particles with oxidants such as chromate and hydrogen peroxide ai et al 2013 mu et al 2015 the electron transfer via certain microbial electron carriers is another possible pathway for the oxidation of the core fe0 by oxygen fig 6 although there was no direct physical contact between the core fe0 and the oxygen at the surface the indirect electron transfer may also be mediated by certain bacteria for example geobacter and shewanella have the capability of the extracellular electron transfer to other species of microbes or ultimate acceptors e g oxygen and iron oxides via electron carriers such as c type cytochromes and microbial nanowires pili reardon and mueller 2013 shi et al 2016 considering the porous structure of the shell of the fe0 feiii granules geobacter which was identified on the fe0 feiii granules fig 5 could inhabit inside the porous structure of the granule shell and can mediate the indirect transfer of electrons from the core fe0 to the feiii hydr oxides and oxygen at the surface via electron carriers the oxidation of the fe0 core during the regeneration of the used fe0 feiii granules was thus another important contributor to the better sulfide control performance of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules it is worth noticing that a portion of fes s formed during the sulfide control were deposited on the sediment particles instead of the fe0 feiii granule surface which is shown by the increases in the concentrations of total iron and avs in the top layer of sediments after the first exhaustion of fe0 feiii granule fig s 8 according to the increases in the concentration of total iron in the top layer the fe loss in the first use cycle can be calculated to be 1 g which was only 7 of total amount of fe added 14 g although this portion of lost fe could not be oxidized back into feiii hydr oxides and serve for the sulfide control in the subsequent reuse cycle the oxidation of the fe0 core and the formation of poorly ordered feooh highly reactive towards sulfide can offset the iron loss and enhance the sulfide control performance of the regenerated fe0 feiii granules 3 4 2 transformations of fe0 feiii granules during repeated regeneration the transformations of the granule shell and the fe0 core of the fe0 feiii granules in the four regeneration cycles was also evaluated the changes in the crystal structure of the feiii hydr oxides on the granule shell are displayed in fig 8a after the fourth regeneration the major feiii hydr oxide crystal on the granule surface was lepidocrocite γ feooh 00 044 1415 the low crystallinity shown by the xrd pattern also suggests the co existence of amorphous feooh γ feooh and amorphous feooh are much less ordered than γ fe2o3 on the virgin granules and iron oxide hydroxide on the granules after the first regeneration cornell and schwertmann 2003 and they can provide a large surface area fig s 6 and have high reactivity with sulfide poulton et al 2004 the changes in the granule core of the fe0 feiii granules were characterized using the xps depth profile analysis and the progressive oxidation of the fe0 core in the four regeneration cycles was observed fig 8b after the fourth regeneration the calculated ratios of feiii at the depth of 20 and 100 nm increased by 10 35 compared to those after the first regeneration therefore the gradual oxidation of fe0 in the core together with the crystal transformation of feiii hydr oxides from ordered ones into poorly ordered ones on the granule shell during the regeneration well explain the enhanced sulfide control performances of the fe0 feiii granules during repeated reuse in addition we also found that the saturation magnetization of the fe0 feiii granules within the four regeneration cycles did not decrease significantly less than 14 fig 8c the results indicate that the gradual oxidation of the magnetic fe0 core during the repeated regeneration would not affect the efficiency of magnetic separation 4 conclusions the fe0 feiii granules added in the top layer of sediments removed 97 of sulfide generated by srb in the river sediments and the sulfide removal capacity of virgin granules was 163 mg s g fe 114 mg s g granule the fe0 feiii granules removed the formed sulfide through the abiotic sulfide oxidation and precipitation and they also stimulated the microbial iron reduction which competitively consumed wastewater derived organics and partially inhibited the sulfate reduction in the sediments the used fe0 feiii granules were easily regenerated through magnetic separation and air exposure for 12 h which enhanced the sulfide removal capacities of the regenerated granules by 12 22 compared to the virgin granules during the air exposure the complete oxidation of feii products on the granule surface and the partial oxidation of fe0 core resulted in the formation of poorly ordered feiii hydroxides γ feooh and amorphous feooh the newly formed feiii hydroxides had larger specific surface areas and higher reactivity to sulfide than γ fe2o3 on the virgin granules the oxidation of the fe0 core may proceed through the indirect electron transfer facilitated by the electrically conductive iron oxide minerals fe3o4 and fe2o3 and also the microbial electron carriers e g c type cytochromes and microbial nanowires of geobacter the fe0 feiii granules were reused for four times in the 293 day trial and their overall sulfide removal capacity was at least 920 mg s g fe this proposed iron cycling process can be a chemical saving energy saving and cost effective

of surface water contamination in this study a three dimensional fully integrated groundwater surface water model was used to simulate the transport characteristics and cumulative loading of an artificial sweetener acesulfame and fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli from wwtps within a 6800 km2 mixed use highly impacted watershed in ontario canada the model which employed 3 5 106 computational nodes and 15 layers facilitated a comprehensive assessment of groundwater surface water interactions under high and low flow conditions processes typically not accounted for in wwtp cumulative effects models simulations demonstrate that the model had significant capacity in reproducing the average and transient multi year groundwater and surface water flow conditions in the watershed as a proxy human specific conservative tracer acesulfame was useful for model validation and to help inform the representation of watershed scale transport processes using a uniform wwtp acesulfame loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 the general spatial trends and magnitudes of the acesulfame concentration profile along the main river reach within the watershed were reproduced however model performance was improved by tuning individual wwtp loading rates although instream dilution and groundwater surface water interactions were strongly dependent on flow conditions the main reach primarily consisted of groundwater discharge zones for this reason hydrodynamic dispersion in the hyporheic zone is shown as the predominant mechanism driving acesulfame into near stream shallow groundwater while under high flow conditions the simulations demonstrate the potential for advective flushing of the shallow groundwater regarding the cumulative impact of the wwtps on e coli concentrations in the surface flow system simulated transient e coli levels downstream of wwtps in the watershed were significantly lower than observed values thus highlighting the potential

watersheds with mixed land uses are influenced by a wide variety of point and non point pollution sources that can contribute nutrients sediment pathogens and other contaminants of concern to surface

responsible for disease outbreaks in these open hydrological hydrogeological systems curriero et al 2001 hynds et al 2014 murphy et al 2016 can be derived from a variety of spatially and temporally variable fecal sources fecal indicator bacteria fib are often used as markers of recent fecal contamination of water public health agency of canada 2016 united states environmental protection agency 2017 but they can also be used to indicate the presence of pathogens prüss 1998 soller et al 2010 tallon et al 2005 quantifying and predicting sources fate transport re growth and degree of

al 2010 lamendella et al 2007 however understanding and predicting the sources of fecal pollution and their cumulative impact on hydrological receptors of public health concern are crucial for determining optimizing and implementing appropriate mitigation measures municipal waste water treatment facilities are designed to treat sewage via a series of processes in ontario these typically include primary sedimentation biological treatment secondary and or tertiary treatments e g chemical precipitation filtration and in many cases disinfection prior to wastewater reuse or discharge to the environment ministry of the environment conservation and parks 2018 within mixed use watersheds municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharge is one of the better characterized sources of bacterial loading to a water course as the effluent is typically monitored and regulated for microbiological and other water quality targets ministry of the environment and climate change 2016 yet despite treatment measures deployed by wwtps to reduce contaminant concentrations in effluent clara et al 2005 kartal et al 2010 many contaminants remain recalcitrant jekel et al 2015 luo et al 2014 furthermore in some watersheds wwtp effluents can significantly impact water quality and stream flow characteristics carey and migliaccio 2009 petersen et al 2005 prat and munné 2000 contaminant loading from wwtps can have significant pulse or chronic impacts on downstream water quality and ecosystem health and in watersheds with multiple wwtps this impact can be exacerbated by cumulative loading effects garcia armisen et al 2014 giusti 2009 ings et al 2011 kehrein et al 2015 tetreault et al 2013 the environmental and public health impact of wwtp effluents can also be highly sensitive to climate factors such as drought where decreased natural flow can result in wwtp effluents contributing a larger proportion of resident stream flow thereby reducing the natural system s capacity to dilute and flush wwtp derived contaminants andersen et al 2004 conversely under flood conditions where dilution potential would naturally be greater wwtps could be forced to divert untreated or partially treated effluent directly to surface water which can lead to higher total contaminant loads to downstream receptors newton et al 2013 in addition to their direct impacts on surface water quality and quantity sewage treatment plants are known to influence directly or indirectly groundwater quality buerge et al 2009 however reliable and robust quantification and or prediction of the cumulative impact of wwtp effluent pollutants on both surface water and groundwater or associated groundwater impacts on dilution and flushing of wwtp contaminants at watershed scales requires hydro physical characterization of surface groundwater exchange processes through the use of integrated contaminant transport models that couple surface and groundwater flow intrinsically niu and phanikumar 2015 yet despite the need for this coupling and especially for highly impacted watersheds with even modest surface groundwater hydrological connectivity such studies are dearth in the literature for example lapworth et al 2012 indicate in their review that there has been little attempt to understand the importance of large scale hydrogeological processes in the context of emerging organic contaminants and that the fate of such contaminants in hyporheic zones are also poorly understood artificial sweeteners have been recognized for their ability to help trace the movement of wwtp effluent in the environment since they are not metabolized in the human body and are largely resistant to wwtp processes loos et al 2013 scheurer et al 2009 subedi and kannan 2014 tran et al 2015 in particular acesulfame has been proposed as an ideal tracer of wastewater in surface and groundwater systems buerge et al 2009 engelhardt et al 2013 gasser et al 2014 robertson et al 2016 roy et al 2014 spoelstra et al 2017 van stempvoort et al 2013 such tracers through surveillance and chemical transport modelling can help inform the relative contributions of anthropogenic sources of pollution

2014 reaction with dissolved ozone scheurer et al 2010 2012 and microbially mediated processes castronovo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 acesulfame is still a very useful surface water tracer because of its ubiquitous occurrence in municipal waste water based on measured acesulfame loads in rivers known to receive wwtp effluent efforts have been made to approximate per capita acesulfame loading with buerge et al 2009 determining on average a value of 9 5 mg person 1 day 1 for rivers within the zurich region of switzerland for the grand river in ontario canada spoelstra et al 2013 determined values in a range of 4 10 mg person 1 day 1 in light of the growing recognition that wwtp effluent derived contaminants as well as other potential surficial contaminant sources are not only impacting surface water quality coppens et al 2015 but also groundwater quality it is becoming increasingly necessary to develop fully coupled groundwater surface water chemical transport modelling approaches to more accurately and robustly predict associated wwtp derived cumulative pollutant effects in watersheds these are desired endpoints of environmental impact assessments and jurisdictional bodies charged to help reduce water quality impacts from anthropogenic activities ball et al 2013 region of waterloo 2018 however because contaminant loads i e sediment nutrient and bacteria in surface water bodies throughout the world are often regulated environment and climate change canada 2016 european union 2016 united states environmental protection agency 2017 there has been a trend towards developing watershed scale contaminant transport modelling methodologies solely for surface water in order to inform decision making ator and garcia 2016 borah and bera 2004 lindim et al 2016 and as a result implications for groundwater are often overlooked with the aforementioned points in mind the overarching objective of this study was to use the hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2018 fully integrated surface water groundwater and chemical transport model to characterize the impact of multiple wwtps on surface water acesulfame and fib concentrations for a highly impacted mixed use watershed the modelling was used to help gauge the relative importance of wwtp sources of fib as compared to more diffuse fib sources such as wildlife naturalization and agricultural drainage runoff the fully coupled modelling framework is demonstrated to provide unique insight on the role of surface water groundwater exchange processes on surface water concentrations and loads acesulfame data derived from the field study of spoelstra et al 2013 was used as the wastewater tracer and model validation target for the simulations herein 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the watershed examined in this study is the 6800 km2 grand river watershed grw in ontario canada fig 1 the grw is a mixed use watershed 70 of the land area is used for agriculture such as livestock dairy cash cropping and fruit and vegetable production 19 of the area is forested and the remainder is urban light rural with a population of approximately 1 million people grand river conservation authority 2019 within the grw there are 28 municipal wwtps with 15 of these plants utilizing tertiary treatment nine plants employing secondary or basic treatment and four municipal lagoons discharging seasonally grand river municipal water managers working group 2009 municipal water requirements in the watershed rely most heavily on groundwater 65 relative to surface water 35 resources grand river conservation authority 2009 surface topography across the grw reflects glacial land forming processes that deposited till outwash and moraines with 351 m of vertical relief between the headwaters and the watershed outlet at lake erie as the grw lies within the michigan sedimentary basin the near surface glacial deposits are underlain by phanerozoic sedimentary bedrock consisting of carbonate sandstone evaporite and shale layers because highly permeable sediments and bedrock units occur near the land surface across much of the grw and also that there is notable topographic relief in the vicinity of the stream and river network groundwater surface water exchanges are important in this watershed system grand river conservation authority 2009 2 2 acesulfame sampling and e coli monitoring water samples for acesulfame analysis were collected at 23 sites fig 2 along the grand river between its headwaters and its outlet at lake erie on three occasions 14 june 2007 5 september 2007 and 24 april 2009 the later date represents a high flow period due to spring runoff conditions in comparison to the previous two sampling dates spoelstra et al 2013 direct sampling of wwtp effluent water for acesulfame analysis was conducted at the kitchener facility on june 2007 1 sample march 2008 six samples obtained over 24 h and september 2013 1 sample effluent from the waterloo facility was sampled on march 2008 six samples obtained over 24 h and september 2013 1 sample a single sample was also obtained from the guelph facility in september 2013 water samples were kept on ice and in the dark prior to being filtered and frozen acesulfame concentrations in the water samples were analysed by ion chromatography dionex 2500 coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ab sciex qtrap 5500 triple quadrupole for full

located upstream from the major urban center in the region sites 2 and 3 are located on tributaries to the grand river canagagigue creek and conestogo river respectively where the catchment areas consist primarily of agricultural land uses site 4 not used in the study herein is in the city of waterloo s wwtp effluent outflow and site 5 is on the main river reach approximately 17 km downstream from the waterloo wwtp near a surface water intake pipe for a drinking water treatment plant river water samples were collected in 1 l sterile sampling bottles from a fast flowing portion of the river by either wading into the stream or using an extendable sampling pole generic e coli analysis of sampled water was performed using standard method 9222d apha et al 2012 at laboratory services branch

employs a globally implicit control volume finite difference element method with adaptive time stepping to simultaneously solve three dimensional subsurface and two dimensional surface water flow and solute transport equations brief descriptions of the governing equations employed by hgs and which are relevant to this study are presented below and for more detail readers are referred to aquanty 2018 for variably saturated 3d subsurface flow hgs uses a modified form of richards equation which is given as 1 k r k h q s w s s h t θ s s w t where k r is the relative permeability of the porous medium k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity tensor s w is the water saturation s s is the specific storage h l is the total water head pressure elevation θ s l3 l 3 is the saturated water content and q l3 l 3 t 1 is a water source or sink term the depth integrated surface flow equation adopted in hgs involves the 2d diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equation which is given as 2 d o k r o k o h o q o t φ o h o where d o l is the depth of flow in the surface domain subscript o φ o is the surface flow domain porosity which varies from 0 at the land surface to 1 at the top of all rills and obstructions h o l is the water surface elevation and k o l t 1 is a friction slope dependent surface conductance which for the purpose of this study is approximated using the manning s equation eqs 1 and 2 are solved simultaneously through the use of an exchange term γ ex l t 1 governing surface and subsurface exchange with a first order gradient based relationship which is given as 3 γ e x k r k e x h h o l e x where k e x l t 1 is the surface subsurface conductance l e x l is the surface subsurface coupling length in the coupling stage of the surface subsurface flow equations the exchange flux is integrated over an interface area resulting in a volumetric flow rate l3 t 1 as described in hwang et al 2014 for a reactive transport simulation hgs solves the following equations with eq 4 representing 3d subsurface transport and eq 5 representing 2d surface water transport 4 θ s s w d c q c q c q e x θ s s w λ c t θ s s w c 5 φ o h o d o c o q o c o q co d o q e x φ

3 t 1 is the mass exchange term that couples the surface and subsurface domains and λ t 1 is a first order decay coefficient note that preceding variable units reflect 3d subsurface transport and for surface transport the dimensionality is constrained to two dimensions the d o and h o terms are the mobile and total surface water depths with the latter including factors such as the sub grid scale immobile depression storage eqs 4 and 5 are coupled through advective and dispersive solute fluxes given as 6 q e x γ e x c u p α e x γ e x θ s s w τ d c c o l e x c h where c up m l 3 is the upstream solute concentration between surface subsurface domains α e x l is the coupling dispersivity between the surface subsurface domains τ is the tortuosity and d l2 t 1 is the free solution diffusion coefficient annual snowfall across the grw ranges from approximately 100 cm in the south to 250 cm in the north grand river conservation authority 2009 so accordingly spatially distributed winter processes are an important consideration in seasonal hydrological modelling in the grw in the hgs model for the grw snow accumulation and snow melting is incorporated through the following relationship where the transient snow depth is calculated as a mass balance between the rates of snow precipitation sublimation and snow melting which is a function of temperature 7 ρ s q s η t a i r t m e l t μ t ρ s d s where d s l is the snow depth which is always positive ρ s m l 3 is the snow density η m t 1 l 2 c 1 is the melting constant q s l t 1 is solid precipitation μ m t 1 l 2 is sublimation and t a i r and t m e l t c are the air temperature and threshold temperature at which snow begins to melt respectively the snow melting rate is assumed proportional to η and the temperature difference t a i r t m e l t 2 3 2 grand river watershed grw model the physical characteristics of the hgs model used in this study are based on the model used by hwang et al 2015 and contains fourteen 3d subsurface element layers and one 2d surface element layer with each layer surface comprised of 2 2 105 mesh nodes and each layer comprised of 4 4 105 triangular finite elements which amount to a total of 3 5 million nodes and 6 6 million triangular prism elements for the full model domain because an unstructured mesh geometry was employed the horizontal discretization varies with resolution ranging from 50 m in the vicinity of river and stream channels to 300 m in areas where the topography is more uniform vertical discretization also varies with a resolution of 0 5 m in the near surface sediments to 100 m within the deeper bedrock hydrostratigraphic units in total the geologic model is composed of seven bedrock units overlain by six unconsolidated units that reflect glacial till coarse moraine and fine glaciolacustrine deposits the hydraulic properties of both the surface and subsurface domains are described in hwang et al 2015 surface topography in the grw model is derived from a hydrologically corrected 25 m digital elevation model spatially distributed land use characterization is based on landsat 7 imagery at 25 m resolution and consists of 16 individual classifications that include key urban agriculture and forest sub sets for which surface roughness factors manning s coefficients are assigned see hwang et al 2015 to increase the similarity between the modelled and observed surface water flows discharge from the seven largest wwtps within the grw table 1 with approximately 90 of the rated wwtp discharge capacity for the entire watershed were incorporated as specified flux boundary conditions water sources in the surface water domain in the grw model for model calibration measured surface water flow rates and groundwater levels were obtained from public sources environment and climate change canada 2015 ministry of the environment and climate change 2013 2 3 3 acesulfame transport under steady state flow steady state monthly average flow conditions were developed for three time periods june 2007 september 2007 and april 2009 in order to facilitate the acesulfame transport simulation for the steady state simulations the hydrologic driver for the hgs model was the average monthly total precipitation derived from 17 environment and climate change canada meteorological stations http climate weather gc ca within and immediately outside the grw precipitation data from the individual stations were spatially interpolated onto a 1000 m 1000 m grid using ordinary kriging with a linear semivariogram and then applied to the hgs model as a specified flux boundary condition over the land surface model calibration for the three individual time periods was carried out using the method presented in hwang et al 2015 where actual evapotranspiration rates within the contributing areas of 15 surface water monitoring locations fig 2b were iteratively adjusted in order to optimize the fit between simulated and observed surface water flow rates groundwater levels at 18 locations across the watershed fig 2b were used as calibration targets for the subsurface flow component of the steady state models steady state flow fields were developed to reproduce the average monthly hydrologic conditions that existed in the grw when acesulfame sampling was conducted in order to minimize the dispersion effects occurring at the interface between the surface and subsurface domains i e hyporheic zones longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were assigned as 1 m and 0 1 m respectively for the surface and subsurface domains the effective diffusion coefficient of acesulfame was set to 10 10 m2 s within the context of maintaining model parsimony perrin et al 2001 we assume that only the 11 largest wwtps serve as sources of acesulfame for the surface water system table 1 an assumption supported by the fact that they represent over 90 of total wwtp discharge in the grw other potential acesulfame sources including residential septic systems and seasonal applications of municipal biosolids to agricultural land were assumed to be relatively minor compared to the wwtp discharges spoelstra et al 2017 subedi and kannan 2014 potential acesulfame inputs from the 17 smaller wwtps were not included because i there is no measured acesulfame data along the tributaries of the grand river ii the contribution of acesulfame loading from the smaller wwtps to the grand river is assumed to be minor because the acesulfame concentrations measured downstream of tributary confluences are lower than those observed immediately upstream from the confluences based on spoelstra et al 2013 and finally iii the discharge capacity and the total treatment population of the smaller wwtps are approximately 7 and 6 of the entire watershed respectively which suggests that the acesulfame loading from the smaller wwtps is minor compared with the wwtps included in the acesulfame simulations grand river municipal water managers working group 2009 although the potential acesulfame sources from residential septic systems agricultural land and smaller wwtps were not included into the model calibrations cumulative acesulfame mass loading rates were estimated with 20 bounds to accommodate the uncertainties related to these uncharacterized acesulfame sources into the grand river acesulfame was introduced into the surface water domain via specified mass flux boundary conditions coincident with the location of the 11 wwtps identified in fig 2a because the measured concentrations are highly dependent on surface flow conditions at the time of sampling acesulfame transport simulations were conducted using monthly average flow conditions for each of the three months when sampling was conducted i e june 2007 september 2007 and april 2009 as a base case simulation the mass loading rates were initially based on average per capita acesulfame estimates provided in spoelstra et al 2013 of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 regarding the population for the mass loading in the base case 2008 population was used which is the average year of the three sampling campaigns performed by spoelstra et al 2013 the population for 2008 at each wwtp was estimated by interpolating population changes between 2006 and 2011 reported by statistics canada table 1 the population served by some smaller wwtps was accounted for by estimating average per capita acesulfame loading to the grand river specifically a total population of approximately 22 580 which drayton arthur st jacobs and elmira wwtps serve was added to the population for the waterloo wwtp which is located downstream of the four smaller wwtps similarly a population of approximately 11 800 for the paris wwtp was included into the population of the brantford wwtp during the acesulfame transport model calibration per capita acesulfame loading rates from each wwtp and for each of the three months considered were adjusted in order to assess the sensitivity of in stream concentrations to mass input rates 2 3 4 e coli transport under transient flow transient monthly average flow was simulated for the january 2010 to december 2012 time interval in order to facilitate e coli transport modelling data from the same meteorological stations employed for the monthly steady state simulations discussed previously were again used however in addition to liquid precipitation temperature was also included in order to incorporate the influence of winter hydrologic processes into the simulation the winter process modelling was carried out external to the transient flow simulations with the specific objective of determining monthly average liquid precipitation snow accumulation and snowmelt rainfall plus snowmelt output from the winter process modelling was applied to the transient flow model as a specified flux surface boundary condition model parameters for controlling the winter processes were determined in an iterative manner during model calibration with the final temperature threshold snow density and melting constant set at 0 c 100 kg m 3 and 1 0 kg day 1 m 2 c 1 respectively model calibration for the april to october time period where evapotranspiration can be considered most significant with respect to its influence on the water budget was again conducted using the method of hwang et al 2015 as described for the steady state scenario however the number of subcatchments for which actual evapotranspiration was iteratively adjusted was limited to three with the surface water monitoring locations represented by upstream west montrose midstream galt and downstream brantford stations along the main stem of the grand river fig 2b groundwater flow calibration for the transient scenarios is based on the comparison between simulated and observed groundwater levels at ten of the 18 groundwater monitoring locations throughout the watershed fig 2b using the calibrated monthly average transient flow model e coli transport simulations were performed to evaluate the relative contributions of wwtps to e coli loading to the grand river regarding microbial transport it is important to consider land use influences because micro organism concentrations in surface water are closely related to land use types particularly agriculture schreiber et al 2015 at three sites 1 2 and 3 of the five e coli monitoring sites shown in fig 3 upstream land use is primarily agriculture and forest at the downstream site site 5 a mix of urban agriculture and forest land uses occur see an inset of fig 3 indicating that multiple e coli sources are likely contributing to the surface flow system notwithstanding complicating elements such as naturalized e coli ishii et al 2010 this hypothesis is also supported by previous work conducted in this area dorner et al 2006 2007 and to further characterize the downstream impacts of upstream land use in our case urban wwtp sources we performed a cumulative effect analysis to evaluate the contributions of the 28 wwtps fig 3 for e coli loading to the main reach of the grand river regarding the setup of the e coli transport model e coli loading was applied to the surface water domain of the model via a mass flux boundary condition the transport parameters such as dispersivity and the effective diffusion coefficient were the same as those assigned for the acesulfame transport simulations for sensitivity test purposes simulations were conducted where e coli was considered conservative as well as subject to representative first order decay rates of 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 day 1 blaustein et al 2013 flint 1987 with the expectation that relevant fate processes i e die off grazing and sedimentation are lumped via the decay coefficient kärnä et al 2010 the mass loading rate assigned in the model was static over the three year simulation period and was based on the discharge rates at the wwtps and the maximum acceptable e coli concentration 2000 cfu l 1 in wwtp effluents in ontario canada ministry of the environment and climate change 2016 this assumption represented a maximum acceptable worst case modelling scenario given that observed effluent concentrations at grw wwtps were on average 2000 cfu l 1 region of waterloo 2018 it is important to note that the e coli simulations conducted here are not intended to implicitly reproduce via tuning model parameters observed surface water concentrations loads but are instead intended to provide a relative gauge of cumulative contributions by wwtps in the grw and by extension predicted environmental benchmarks by which to elucidate e coli contributions from non wwtp sources 3 results 3 1 surface water and groundwater hydrology for the quasi steady state conditions simulated and observed surface water flow rates matched very closely for both the low flow june and september 2007 and high flow april 2009 scenarios with the r2 0 97 p 0 05 fig 4 a although the simulated low flows tended to slightly overestimate the observed flows the maximum difference is 2 3 m3 s 1 which equates to approximately 13 of the flow rate at the brantford gauging station under low flow conditions for high flow conditions in the upstream reaches the maximum deviation between the observed and simulated flow is 1 9 m3 s 1 or approximately 2 of the flow rate at brantford under high flow conditions based on the wwtp discharge rates presented in table 1 treatment plant effluent composed 2 6 and 15 9 of total stream flow at brantford during april 2009 and september 2007 respectively the difference in the proportion of wwtp effluent in the main river reach is directly related to natural flow rates being approximately five times higher during the high flow season on account of snowmelt higher groundwater contributions and low evapotranspiration in contrast during the low flow season the water table tends to be lower and evapotranspiration rates are much higher simulated groundwater levels under the quasi steady state conditions also match closely with measured values with an r2 of 0 99 p 0 05 for the temporal scenarios fig 4b across the observation wells that were used for steady state model calibration groundwater levels vary from 195 to 508 m a s l while from the high flow to the low flow seasons groundwater levels decline by approximately 2 m which highlights that the seasonal hydrologic differences are much more pronounced in the surface water system the model was also able to simulate the monthly transient surface water flow rates over the 2010 2012 simulation interval with r2 values ranging from 0 88 at the upstream location to 0 95 and 0 96 at the midstream and downstream locations respectively all p 0 05 fig 5 overall the inter seasonal and inter annual variability in surface water flow rates was adequately reproduced with close correlation between the simulated and observed peak and low flow magnitudes and timing over the entire 3 year transient simulation interval the maximum deviation between simulated and measured surface water flow rates was 26 m3 s 1 which is approximately 78 of the measured stream flow rate at the brantford gauge in october 2012 monthly transient groundwater levels were also adequately reproduced by the model fig 6 like the quasi steady state simulations the transient simulations show that groundwater levels exhibit much lower temporal variability than surface water flow rates over the 3 year simulation period the average water table fluctuation in the wells used for transient model calibration was 4 m while the maximum deviation between simulated and observed levels was 11 m 3 2 acesulfame transport acesulfame was simulated using two different loading scenarios i a uniform per capita rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 based on the estimate made by spoelstra et al 2013 and ii manually tuned loading rates for each wwtp that provided simulation results with optimal upper and lower simulated acesulfame concentration bounds for the measured instream concentrations fig 7 3 2 1 uniform loading rate in the river reaches upstream from the major urban centers and where surface water flow rates are low in comparison to reaches further downstream simulated acesulfame concentrations are highly sensitive to loading rates at the small upstream wwtps fig 7 under low flow conditions i e june and september 2007 the base loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 leads to simulated concentrations in the upstream reaches that are slightly higher than those observed at observation points 7 and 8 fig 7a and b whereas further downstream where flow rates progressively increase differences between simulated and observed acesulfame concentrations tend to diminish along with the relative impact of the uppermost wwtp the spatial variability in the fit between observed and simulated acesulfame concentrations generated from the uniform per capita loading scenario is further highlighted by considering the significant p 0 05 r2 and percent bias pbias values for june and september 2007 linear regressions that consider all sampling points yield an r2 of 0 94 pbias 10 5 and 0 92 pbias 12 6 respectively which indicates that the uniform loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 under the low flow conditions is a reasonable estimation in contrast to the low flow scenarios the fit between observed and simulated acesulfame concentrations under the april 2009 high flow scenario is relatively low with a r2 of 0 53 p 0 05 and 47 1 for pbias fig 7c which suggests that the uniform loading rate is possibly underestimated during the high flow season although there is some discrepancy between the observed and simulated acesulfame concentrations when assuming the per capita loading rate is uniform the general spatial and temporal trends are reproduced reasonably well along the entire length of the grand river for both the low and high flow conditions with the impact of both dilution as a function of flow rate and the location of major urban centers being readily apparent 3 2 2 calibrated acesulfame loading rate notwithstanding the acesulfame dissipation processes identified previously effluent acesulfame concentrations are expected to be affected to some degree by the variable treatment technologies grand river conservation authority 2018 region of waterloo 2018 utilized by wwtps in the grw furthermore differences in the dietary habits of communities and the types of wastewater contributing to the wwtp influents e g industrial storm water all affect resulting acesulfame concentrations therefore the fit between observed and simulated acesulfame concentrations was significantly improved by individually tuning the loading from each wwtp and by utilizing upper and lower 20 20 bounds with the optimized rate fig 7 for low flow conditions the simulated upstream per capita loading was similar to the uniform loading rate but slightly reduced by a factor of 2 5 table 1 in order to bring the simulated concentrations in line with the observed concentrations at sites 1 to 6 however at the two largest wwtps by source population waterloo and kitchener in the model the calibrated loading rates remained in close range to the uniform loading rate at 4 9 12 0 mg person 1 day 1 per capita loading from the other wwtps was variable and ranged from 0 to 24 4 mg person 1 day 1 for low flow conditions it is important to note that the steep rise in acesulfame concentrations observed between observation points 9 and 11 is largely caused by inputs from the two largest wwtps in the grw on the other hand further downstream the individual wwtps have less impact the brantford facility which is the furthest downstream wwtp considered in the simulations highlights the progressive decrease in sensitivity because of the cumulative source effect of the upstream wwtps that masks the acesulfame concentrations discharged from the brantford wwtp even though the per capita loading at the brantford site was greatly reduced during calibration the simulated acesulfame concentrations downstream observation sites 17 23 were still in line with those generated by the simulations where a uniform loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 was employed for high flow conditions the calibrated loading at the uppermost wwtp dundalk was reduced to 0 as there were effectively no acesulfame detections upstream of point 5 however the loading from the waterloo and kitchener wwtps was increased to 11 5 30 5 mg person 1 day 1 in order to match the magnitude of the observed concentration peak coincident with the major urban center similar to the low flow condition the impact from individual wwtps downstream from waterloo and kitchener progressively diminishes under high flow conditions as well as it is the cumulative acesulfame mass input from all upstream wwtps that controls the instream acesulfame concentrations for both the low and high flow scenarios where acesulfame loading rates were tuned during calibration the average per capita loading across all the wwtps considered in the simulations ranged from 3 9 mg person 1 day 1 june 2007 20 scenario to 14 1 mg person 1 day 1 april 2009 20 scenario which envelopes the loading rates calculated by buerge et al 2009 and spoelstra et al 2013 3 3 groundwater surface water interactions 3 3 1 water mass exchange simulated groundwater surface water interactions are highly dynamic in both space and time across the watershed under the low flow conditions fig 8 a the major river reaches tend to gain water from groundwater discharge exfiltration while groundwater recharge infiltration occurs across much of the land surface during high flow conditions fig 8b groundwater discharge is occurring within the majority of rivers and streams as well many low lying depression areas while groundwater recharge is primarily occurring in upland or flat lying regions in general the simulations show that groundwater discharge is much more spatially focused than groundwater recharge which is evidenced by the peak exfiltration and infiltration rates of 5000 mm year 1 and 500 mm year 1 respectively the dynamic nature of groundwater surface water interactions are further elucidated by considering how fluctuations in water table elevations can influence shallow groundwater discharge along river channels processes deemed by lapworth et al 2012 as being an acute knowledge gap in the context of contaminant transport of emerging organic contaminants two dimensional cross sectional perspectives through transect a a shown in the insets of fig 8 depict simulated water table elevation water saturation levels and surface subsurface water exchange rates represented with scaled reference vectors for the low flow and the high flow conditions as the cross section in fig 8a illustrates under low flow conditions the primary groundwater discharge occurs directly beneath the river bed because the water table along the river bank is depressed this in turn limits the opportunity for lateral shallow groundwater discharge to the river which can impact surface water dilution in comparison during high flow conditions fig 8b the elevated water table increases lateral hydraulic gradients and leads to a much higher discharge of the shallow local groundwater adjacent to the river bank in these types of hydrologic settings the contribution of deeper groundwater to river flow under low and high flow conditions is relatively stable compared to shallow groundwater discharge which is highly dependent on the water table elevation 3 3 2 acesulfame mass exchange under both low and high flow conditions the primary transport mechanism for acesulfame to move from the surface water into the groundwater is by hydrodynamic dispersion mass exchange within the hyporheic zones along the rivers with diffusion being the primary driver as advective mass movement is limited by the major rivers being primarily groundwater discharge zones see insets of fig 9 a and b under low flow conditions fig 9a the peak rate of acesulfame infiltration from the surface water into near stream shallow groundwater is slightly higher than the peak rate of acesulfame exfiltration from shallow groundwater into the surface water at 2600 and 1900 ng l 1 year 1 respectively whereas under high flow conditions fig 9b the peak infiltration rate is less than the peak rate of exfiltration at 2000 and 3000 ng l 1 year 1 respectively the higher rate of acesulfame discharge under high flow conditions highlights the increased opportunity that exists for flushing contaminants out of the shallow groundwater system under wet conditions when water table elevation and groundwater discharge rates increase 3 4 e coli transport when evaluating the performance of the e coli simulations it is important to acknowledge the large spatial and temporal variability in the measured data fig 10 a for which loading rates based on constant point source concentrations would be difficult to prescribe as an example geometric mean concentrations at sites 1 2 and 3 were 400 2000 and 700 cfu l 1 with respective standard deviation in log10 of 3 1 3 8 and 3 7 these large variations in the e coli concentration profiles indicate that surface water in this area is affected by various e coli sources as reported by dorner et al 2007 this is further reinforced by the modelling results fig 10b and c which indicate that conservative e coli decay rates λ 0 0 day 1 black dotted line assigned to all the wwtps lead to considerable underestimates of concentrations at observation sites 1 fig 10b and 5 observed geometric mean 1942 cfu l 1 fig 10c the geometric mean of the simulated e coli concentration using the λ 0 0 day 1 value at site 1 is 13 cfu l 1 and at site 5 is 52 cfu l 1 which in both cases is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the observation geometric mean by increasing the decay rate the simulated e coli concentrations decrease further and the difference for a simulation with a decay rate of 3 d 1 is larger than two orders of magnitude there are similarities between simulated e coli and acesulfame behavior with e coli simulation results also demonstrating that wwtp derived concentrations are heavily influenced by dilution with instream concentrations being highest during low flow conditions and lowest during high flow conditions the simulation results also demonstrate that the influence of decay on e coli concentrations between observation sites and upstream wwtps is inversely proportional to the flow as higher velocities reduce travel time and hence also reduce the opportunity for time dependent bacteria die off fig 10b and c under the e coli discharge scenario with λ 0 0 day 1 that considers 28 wwtps in the grw all discharging effluent with an e coli concentration of 2000 cfu l 1 we analysed the relative contribution of each wwtp to the e coli loading at the midstream and watershed outlet points fig 11 the midstream point is located in between waterloo 11 and kitchener 12 wwtps and the watershed outlet point is located at the mouth of the grand river at lake erie the average relative contribution of the waterloo 11 wwtp at the midstream point is approximately 80 of the total simulated wwtp derived e coli concentration in the river and the contributions from other wwtps are minor or negligible except for fergus wwtp 4 which contributes about 5 at the watershed outlet the relative contribution of the upstream wwtps declines in importance relative to the additional 17 wwtps 12 28 downstream of the mid point the major contributors of the simulated e coli at the watershed outlet point are waterloo 11 kitchener 12 guelph 13 galt 16 and brantford 23 wwtps for which total attributed contribution is about 80 using this sensitivity analysis method monitoring locations can be optimized for detecting or identifying contaminant sources discharged from wastewater treatment plants in a watershed 4 discussion reproducing surface water flow rates is arguably the most important component in a concentration based assessment of surface water contamination derived from continuous mass loading scenarios this contention holds true here where the loading of both acesulfame and e coli are represented by constant mass fluxes into the surface water domain while the simulated contaminant levels could have been reported in terms of loads the resulting time series data would fail to depict the dynamic interplay between the surface water flow characteristics and concentrations which is an important consideration given that surface water quality criteria are often stipulated in terms of concentrations furthermore by calculating surface water concentrations we were able to identify the sensitivity of simulated instream concentration levels to flow rates during both high and low flow conditions as expected the simulated instream acesulfame concentrations were sensitive to loading rates while the uniform loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 spoelstra et al 2013 provided a reasonable fit to observed concentration levels along the main reach of the grand river model performance was greatly improved by adjusting individual wwtp loading rates having to represent the wwtp loadings individually in the model is not unexpected as it can be surmised that the per capita consumption of acesulfame can be quite variable over time and space indeed the acesulfame loading rates based on the measured wwtp effluent samples were approximately 5 39 0 67 mg person 1 day 1 in kitchener june 2007 march 2008 and september 2013 5 64 0 81 mg person 1 day 1 in waterloo march 2008 and september 2013 and 3 75 mg person 1 day 1 in guelph september 2013 comparatively the estimated mass loading rates including low and high flow seasons range from 4 87 to 16 66 mg person 1 day 1 in kitchener from 7 85 to 30 51 mg person 1 day 1 in waterloo and from 1 22 to 8 05 mg person 1 day 1 in guelph overall the estimated mass loading rates overlap with measured rates for the kitchener and guelph wwtp facilities with a slight positive bias in the estimated values whereas even the lowest estimated loading rate for the waterloo wwtp 7 85 mg person 1 day 1 was 2 21 mg person 1 day 1 higher than the mean measured value large variability in estimates of per capita acesulfame consumption is not unexpected previous work by buerge et al 2009 identified the mean per capita acesulfame loading from wastewater in and around zurich switzerland to be 11 mg person 1 day 1 with a standard deviation of 4 2 as such even the adjusted overall average per capita consumption values applied in this study ranging from 5 0 to 11 7 mg person 1 day 1 are comparable in terms of both magnitude and variability it should also be noted that the adjustments made here to the wwtp loading rates for acesulfame may have been at least in part compensating for simulated flow biases and acesulfame degradation effects scheurer et al 2014 during low flow conditions the input acesulfame loading in the upper reaches was systematically reduced conversely during high flow conditions the prescribed acesulfame loading at the two largest wwtps along the river course was increased in order for the model to better match the notable spike in observed concentrations downstream of the major urban center within the watershed one of the novel aspects of utilizing a fully integrated physics based model to simulate the downstream migration of wwtp effluent is that the spatially and temporally variable mass exchange between surface water and groundwater is dynamically represented as already noted these exchanges can be critical in the context of dilution and flushing of contaminants and are underrepresented in watershed scale chemical microbial transport modelling initiatives lapworth et al 2012 in the case of the acesulfame simulations conducted here the inclusion of a hydrodynamic mass exchange between the surface water and the groundwater provided the principal mechanism for wwtp derived contaminant mass to enter the shallow near stream groundwater or riparian systems hyporheic zone along the grand river regarding the solute mass exchange in the hyporheic zone there have been many studies conducted for investigating physico chemical biological interactions e g boano et al 2014 castro and hornberger 1991 chow et al 2019 hancock 2002 jacobs et al 1988 nagorski and moore 1999 in a recent river reach scale study chow et al 2019 investigated solute mass exchange in the hyporheic zone surrounding a stream meander and found flow paths in the surface water system penetrated through the hyporheic zone thus indicating that shallow groundwater quality can be directly affected by solute mass in the surface water system similarly but at a much larger scale results herein show that the hyporheic zone along the grand river also facilitates solute mass infiltration and exfiltration during both low and high flow conditions additionally previous smaller scale integrated modelling studies jones et al 2006 liggett et al 2015 park et al 2011 have identified hydrodynamic dispersion to be an important chemical transport process in the context of groundwater surface water interactions the simulations generated here corroborate the importance of hydrodynamic dispersion and represent a rare example of the impact of this process at a watershed scale furthermore by identifying the flow rate induced differences in acesulfame mass exchange the simulation results suggest how surface water solute loading could be exacerbated under high flow conditions due to shallow groundwater flushing that drives contaminants back into the river nagorski and moore 1999 in the case of the more recalcitrant chemicals such as acesulfame derived from long term continuous point sources such as wwtps this seasonal or event driven flushing of shallow groundwater has the capability to significantly alter the surface water temporal loading patterns beyond what would be expected from a continuous source alone although not the focus of this study it can be anticipated that this type of watershed scale transport phenomena can have a significant impact on water quality at downstream surface water receptors which in the case of this study is lake erie as with previous watershed scale fib studies frey et al 2013 harmel et al 2010 lyautey et al 2010 wilkes et al 2011 the results from this study also point to the importance of characterizing non point sources in order to comprehensively reproduce a watershed scale natural system this requirement is widely recognized by the community of modelers who utilize hydrologic response unit hru based models such as swat e g cho et al 2012 coffey et al 2010 parajuli et al 2009 to simulate in stream bacteria loads and the results from this work indeed show that this necessity holds true for integrated physics based modelling approaches as well while the results here demonstrate that characterizing point source contributions of major wwtps is necessary in the simulation of fib in urbanized watersheds characterizing diffuse agriculture and wildlife sources inputs in the model would be a necessity for simulations to reproduce observed surface water fib densities in mixed use watersheds recently wilkes et al 2019 showed that in stream near stream fib reservoirs in small drainage ditches overwhelmingly dominated median 99 e coli loads in the ditches in relation to tile drainage contributions that being said for any work focusing specifically on the impact of wwtp derived fib loading on downstream water quality the point source based integrated modelling approach demonstrated here provides novel insights on how the groundwater and surface water flow systems can influence instream contaminant behavior across a range of meteorological conditions finally the relative contribution of contaminants discharged from multiple wwtps can be quantified using the sensitivity analysis that frames the results in a cumulative effects context 5 conclusions this study successfully applied a high resolution physics based groundwater surface water model to a watershed scale 6800 km2 flow and transport problem considering the scale and hydrologic complexity of the model domain surface flow rates and groundwater levels were reproduced well under both steady state and transient conditions by incorporating multiple wwtps as point sources within the model framework the cumulative measured concentration profile of acesulfame which was treated here as a conservative tracer was reproduced by the model for the main river reaches within the watershed acesulfame was demonstrated to be a valuable tracer for validating both the flow and transport components of the model and as such we feel acesulfame can be used to help characterize large scale spatially and temporally variable groundwater surface water interactions in systems impacted by wwtps the simulation results show that wwtp locations stream order and antecedent hydrologic conditions have a strong influence on the simulated acesulfame concentrations in the low order river reaches simulated acesulfame concentrations based on average per capita consumption estimates tended to slightly exceed the measured concentrations with the deviation being amplified during low flow conditions in part because of the challenge in reproducing low surface water flow rates within low order streams in watershed scale models in the higher order reaches downstream from the largest wwtps the simulated acesulfame concentrations generally matched well with measured concentrations although under high flow conditions loading rates based on average per capita consumption led to simulated concentrations that somewhat underestimated observed values overall the results indicate that simple acesulfame loading estimates can be effectively utilized to assist with calibration and validation of physically rigorous flow and transport models for a worst case effluent concentration scenario of wwtp impacts on fib levels along the main river reach the simulations suggest that wwtps only modestly impact downstream e coli levels as the simulated concentrations were about two orders of magnitude lower than the downstream measured e coli concentrations this finding is promising from a wwtp cumulative effects standpoint for many targets in a watershed with dozens of wwtp facilities gillis 2012 additionally measured e coli levels in upstream reaches as well as e coli concentration peaks during high flow runoff conditions highlight the fact that other sources i e agriculture and wildlife can be notable if not dominant contributors to in stream concentrations loads based on the outcome from this work including the sensitivity analysis fully integrated physics based models warrant further applications as tools to help understand cumulative loading impacts on watershed scale surface water and

of surface water contamination in this study a three dimensional fully integrated groundwater surface water model was used to simulate the transport characteristics and cumulative loading of an artificial sweetener acesulfame and fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli from wwtps within a 6800 km2 mixed use highly impacted watershed in ontario canada the model which employed 3 5 106 computational nodes and 15 layers facilitated a comprehensive assessment of groundwater surface water interactions under high and low flow conditions processes typically not accounted for in wwtp cumulative effects models simulations demonstrate that the model had significant capacity in reproducing the average and transient multi year groundwater and surface water flow conditions in the watershed as a proxy human specific conservative tracer acesulfame was useful for model validation and to help inform the representation of watershed scale transport processes using a uniform wwtp acesulfame loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 the general spatial trends and magnitudes of the acesulfame concentration profile along the main river reach within the watershed were reproduced however model performance was improved by tuning individual wwtp loading rates although instream dilution and groundwater surface water interactions were strongly dependent on flow conditions the main reach primarily consisted of groundwater discharge zones for this reason hydrodynamic dispersion in the hyporheic zone is shown as the predominant mechanism driving acesulfame into near stream shallow groundwater while under high flow conditions the simulations demonstrate the potential for advective flushing of the shallow groundwater regarding the cumulative impact of the wwtps on e coli concentrations in the surface flow system simulated transient e coli levels downstream of wwtps in the watershed were significantly lower than observed values thus highlighting the potential

watersheds with mixed land uses are influenced by a wide variety of point and non point pollution sources that can contribute nutrients sediment pathogens and other contaminants of concern to surface and subsurface hydrological receptors barnes et al 2008 bradshaw et al 2016 carpenter et al 1998 kolpin et al 2002 novotny and chesters 1989 wilkes et al 2011 for example waterborne pathogens responsible for disease outbreaks in these open hydrological hydrogeological systems curriero et al 2001 hynds et al 2014 murphy et al 2016 can be derived from a variety of spatially and temporally variable fecal sources fecal indicator bacteria fib are often used as markers of recent fecal contamination of water public health agency of canada 2016 united states environmental protection agency 2017 but they can also be used to indicate the presence of pathogens prüss 1998 soller et al 2010 tallon et al 2005 quantifying and predicting sources fate transport re growth and degree of

al 2010 lamendella et al 2007 however understanding and predicting the sources of fecal pollution and their cumulative impact on hydrological receptors of public health concern are crucial for determining optimizing and implementing appropriate mitigation measures municipal waste water treatment facilities are designed to treat sewage via a series of processes in ontario these typically include primary sedimentation biological treatment secondary and or tertiary treatments e g chemical precipitation filtration and in many cases disinfection prior to wastewater reuse or discharge to the environment ministry of the environment conservation and parks 2018 within mixed use watersheds municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharge is one of the better characterized sources of bacterial loading to a water course as the effluent is typically monitored and regulated for microbiological and other water quality targets ministry of the environment and climate change 2016 yet despite treatment measures deployed by wwtps to reduce contaminant concentrations in effluent clara et al 2005 kartal et al 2010 many contaminants remain recalcitrant jekel et al 2015 luo et al 2014 furthermore in some watersheds wwtp effluents can significantly impact water quality and stream flow characteristics carey and migliaccio 2009 petersen et al 2005 prat and munné 2000 contaminant loading from wwtps can have significant pulse or chronic impacts on downstream water quality and ecosystem health and in watersheds with multiple wwtps this impact can be exacerbated by cumulative loading effects garcia armisen et al 2014 giusti 2009 ings et al 2011 kehrein et al 2015 tetreault et al 2013 the environmental and public health impact of wwtp effluents can also be highly sensitive to climate factors such as drought where decreased natural flow can result in wwtp effluents contributing a larger proportion of resident stream flow thereby reducing the natural system s capacity to dilute and flush wwtp derived contaminants andersen et al 2004 conversely under flood conditions where dilution potential would naturally be greater wwtps could be forced to divert untreated or partially treated effluent directly to surface water which can lead to higher total contaminant loads to downstream receptors newton et al 2013 in addition to their direct impacts on surface water quality and quantity sewage treatment plants are known to influence directly or indirectly groundwater quality buerge et al 2009 however reliable and robust quantification and or prediction of the cumulative impact of wwtp effluent pollutants on both surface water and groundwater or associated groundwater impacts on dilution and flushing of wwtp contaminants at watershed scales requires hydro physical characterization of surface groundwater exchange processes through the use of integrated contaminant transport models that couple surface and groundwater flow intrinsically niu and phanikumar 2015 yet despite the need for this coupling and especially for highly impacted watersheds with even modest surface groundwater hydrological connectivity such studies are dearth in the literature for example lapworth et al 2012 indicate in their review that there has been little attempt to understand the importance of large scale hydrogeological processes in the context of emerging organic contaminants and that the fate of such contaminants in hyporheic zones are also poorly understood artificial sweeteners have been recognized for their ability to help trace the movement of wwtp effluent in the environment since they are not metabolized in the human body and are largely resistant to wwtp processes loos et al 2013 scheurer et al 2009 subedi and kannan 2014 tran et al 2015 in particular acesulfame has been proposed as an ideal tracer of wastewater in surface and groundwater systems buerge et al 2009 engelhardt et al 2013 gasser et al 2014 robertson et al 2016 roy et al 2014 spoelstra et al 2017 van stempvoort et al 2013 such tracers through surveillance and chemical transport modelling can help inform the relative contributions of anthropogenic sources of pollution in watersheds where the nature of the pollution pathway can vary temporally and spatially while it is recognized that some degradation can occur as a result of photolysis gan et al 2014 scheurer et al 2014 reaction with dissolved ozone scheurer et al 2010 2012 and microbially mediated processes castronovo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 acesulfame is still a very useful surface water tracer because of its ubiquitous occurrence in municipal waste water based on measured acesulfame loads in rivers known to receive wwtp effluent efforts have been made to approximate per capita acesulfame loading with buerge et al 2009 determining on average a value of 9 5 mg person 1 day 1 for rivers within the zurich region of switzerland for the grand river in ontario canada spoelstra et al 2013 determined values in a range of 4 10 mg person 1 day 1 in light of the growing recognition that wwtp effluent derived contaminants as well as other potential surficial contaminant sources are not only impacting surface water quality coppens et al 2015 but also groundwater quality it is becoming increasingly necessary to develop fully coupled groundwater surface water chemical transport modelling approaches to more accurately and robustly predict associated wwtp derived cumulative pollutant effects in watersheds these are desired endpoints of environmental impact assessments and jurisdictional bodies charged to help reduce water quality impacts from anthropogenic activities ball et al 2013 region of waterloo 2018 however because contaminant loads i e sediment nutrient and bacteria in surface water bodies throughout the world are often regulated environment and climate change canada 2016 european union 2016 united states environmental protection agency 2017 there has been a trend towards developing watershed scale contaminant transport modelling methodologies solely for surface water in order to inform decision making ator and garcia 2016 borah and bera 2004 lindim et al 2016 and as a result implications for groundwater are often overlooked with the aforementioned points in mind the overarching objective of this study was to use the hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2018 fully integrated surface water groundwater and chemical transport model to characterize the impact of multiple wwtps on surface water acesulfame and fib concentrations for a highly impacted mixed use watershed the modelling was used to help gauge the relative importance of wwtp sources of fib as compared to more diffuse fib sources such as wildlife naturalization and agricultural drainage runoff the fully coupled modelling framework is demonstrated to provide unique insight on the role of surface water groundwater exchange processes on surface water concentrations and loads acesulfame data derived from the field study of spoelstra et al 2013 was used as the wastewater tracer and model validation target for the simulations herein 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the watershed examined in this study is the 6800 km2 grand river watershed grw in ontario canada fig 1 the grw is a mixed use watershed 70 of the land area is used for agriculture such as livestock dairy cash cropping and fruit and vegetable production 19 of the area is forested and the remainder is urban light rural with a population of approximately 1 million people grand river conservation authority 2019 within the grw there are 28 municipal wwtps with 15 of these plants utilizing tertiary treatment nine plants employing secondary or basic treatment and four municipal lagoons discharging seasonally grand river municipal water managers working group 2009 municipal water requirements in the watershed rely most heavily on groundwater 65 relative to surface water 35 resources grand river conservation authority 2009 surface topography across the grw reflects glacial land forming processes that deposited till outwash and moraines with 351 m of vertical relief between the headwaters and the watershed outlet at lake erie as the grw lies within the michigan sedimentary basin the near surface glacial deposits are underlain by phanerozoic sedimentary bedrock consisting of carbonate sandstone evaporite and shale layers because highly permeable sediments and bedrock units occur near the land surface across much of the grw and also that there is notable topographic relief in the vicinity of the stream and river network groundwater surface water exchanges are important in this watershed system grand river conservation authority 2009 2 2 acesulfame sampling and e coli monitoring water samples for acesulfame analysis were collected at 23 sites fig 2 along the grand river between its headwaters and its outlet at lake erie on three occasions 14 june 2007 5 september 2007 and 24 april 2009 the later date represents a high flow period due to spring runoff conditions in comparison to the previous two sampling dates spoelstra et al 2013 direct sampling of wwtp effluent water for acesulfame analysis was conducted at the kitchener facility on june 2007 1 sample march 2008 six samples obtained over 24 h and september 2013 1 sample effluent from the waterloo facility was sampled on march 2008 six samples obtained over 24 h and september 2013 1 sample a single sample was also obtained from the guelph facility in september 2013 water samples were kept on ice and in the dark prior to being filtered and frozen acesulfame concentrations in the water samples were analysed by ion chromatography dionex 2500 coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ab sciex qtrap 5500 triple quadrupole for full details of the analysis methodology including detection limits and precision readers are referred to van stempvoort et al 2011 and spoelstra et al 2013 as part of the foodnet canada surveillance system water quality monitoring was conducted bi weekly from 2005 to 2013 at five locations fig 3 in the region of waterloo which is the largest municipal area in the grw site 1 grand river north is located upstream from the major urban center in the region sites 2 and 3 are located on tributaries to the grand river canagagigue creek and conestogo river respectively where the catchment areas consist primarily of agricultural land uses site 4 not used in the study herein is in the city of waterloo s wwtp effluent outflow and site 5 is on the main river reach approximately 17 km downstream from the waterloo wwtp near a surface water intake pipe for a drinking water treatment plant river water samples were collected in 1 l sterile sampling bottles from a fast flowing portion of the river by either wading into the stream or using an extendable sampling pole generic e coli analysis of sampled water was performed using standard method 9222d apha et al 2012 at laboratory services branch

employs a globally implicit control volume finite difference element method with adaptive time stepping to simultaneously solve three dimensional subsurface and two dimensional surface water flow and solute transport equations brief descriptions of the governing equations employed by hgs and which are relevant to this study are presented below and for more detail readers are referred to aquanty 2018 for variably saturated 3d subsurface flow hgs uses a modified form of richards equation which is given as 1 k r k h q s w s s h t θ s s w t where k r is the relative permeability of the porous medium k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity tensor s w is the water saturation s s is the specific storage h l is the total water head pressure elevation θ s l3 l 3 is the saturated water content and q l3 l 3 t 1 is a water source or sink term the depth integrated surface flow equation adopted in hgs involves the 2d diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equation which is given as 2 d o k r o k o h o q o t φ o h o where d o l is the depth of flow in the surface domain subscript o φ o is the surface flow domain porosity which varies from 0 at the land surface to 1 at the top of all rills and obstructions h o l is the water surface elevation and k o l t 1 is a friction slope dependent surface conductance which for the purpose of this study is approximated using the manning s equation eqs 1 and 2 are solved simultaneously through the use of an exchange term γ ex l t 1 governing surface and subsurface exchange with a first order gradient based relationship which is given as 3 γ e x k r k e x h h o l e x where k e x l t 1 is the surface subsurface conductance l e x l is the surface subsurface coupling length in the coupling stage of the surface subsurface flow equations the exchange flux is integrated over an interface area resulting in a volumetric flow rate l3 t 1 as described in hwang et al 2014 for a reactive transport simulation hgs solves the following equations with eq 4 representing 3d subsurface transport and eq 5 representing 2d surface water transport 4 θ s s w d c q c q c q e x θ s s w λ c t θ s s w c 5 φ o h o d o c o q o c o q co d o q e x φ o h o λ c o t φ o h o c o where c m l 3 is the solute concentration d l2 t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor q l t 1 is the darcy flux q c m l 3 t 1 is an external source or a sink term q ex m l 3 t 1 is the mass exchange term that couples the surface and subsurface domains and λ t 1 is a first order decay coefficient note that preceding variable units reflect 3d subsurface transport and for surface transport the dimensionality is constrained to two dimensions the d o and h o terms are the mobile and total surface water depths with the latter including factors such as the sub grid scale immobile depression storage eqs 4 and 5 are coupled through advective and dispersive solute fluxes given as 6 q e x γ e x c u p α e x γ e x θ s s w τ d c c o l e x c h where c up m l 3 is the upstream solute concentration between surface subsurface domains α e x l is the coupling dispersivity between the surface subsurface domains τ is the tortuosity and d l2 t 1 is the free solution diffusion coefficient annual snowfall across the grw ranges from approximately 100 cm in the south to 250 cm in the north grand river conservation authority 2009 so accordingly spatially distributed winter processes are an important consideration in seasonal hydrological modelling in the grw in the hgs model for the grw snow accumulation and snow melting is incorporated through the following relationship where the transient snow depth is calculated as a mass balance between the rates of snow precipitation sublimation and snow melting which is a function of temperature 7 ρ s q s η t a i r t m e l t μ t ρ s d s where d s l is the snow depth which is always positive ρ s m l 3 is the snow density η m t 1 l 2 c 1 is the melting constant q s l t 1 is solid precipitation μ m t 1 l 2 is sublimation and t a i r and t m e l t c are the air temperature and threshold temperature at which snow begins to melt respectively the snow melting rate is assumed proportional to η and the temperature difference t a i r t m e l t 2 3 2 grand river watershed grw model the physical characteristics of the hgs model used in this study are based on the model used by hwang et al 2015 and contains fourteen 3d subsurface element layers and one 2d surface element layer with each layer surface comprised of 2 2 105 mesh nodes and each layer comprised of 4 4 105 triangular finite elements which amount to a total of 3 5 million nodes and 6 6 million triangular prism elements for the full model domain because an unstructured mesh geometry was employed the horizontal discretization varies with resolution ranging from 50 m in the vicinity of river and stream channels to 300 m in areas where the topography is more uniform vertical discretization also varies with a resolution of 0 5 m in the near surface sediments to 100 m within the deeper bedrock hydrostratigraphic units in total the geologic model is composed of seven bedrock units overlain by six unconsolidated units that reflect glacial till coarse moraine and fine glaciolacustrine deposits the hydraulic properties of both the surface and subsurface domains are described in hwang et al 2015 surface topography in the grw model is derived from a hydrologically corrected 25 m digital elevation model spatially distributed land use characterization is based on landsat 7 imagery at 25 m resolution and consists of 16 individual classifications that include key urban agriculture and forest sub sets for which surface roughness factors manning s coefficients are assigned see hwang et al 2015 to increase the similarity between the modelled and observed surface water flows discharge from the seven largest wwtps within the grw table 1 with approximately 90 of the rated wwtp discharge capacity for the entire watershed were incorporated as specified flux boundary conditions water sources in the surface water domain in the grw model for model calibration measured surface water flow rates and groundwater levels were obtained from public sources environment and climate change canada 2015 ministry of the environment and climate change 2013 2 3 3 acesulfame transport under steady state flow steady state monthly average flow conditions were developed for three time periods june 2007 september 2007 and april 2009 in order to facilitate the acesulfame transport simulation for the steady state simulations the hydrologic driver for the hgs model was the average monthly total precipitation derived from 17 environment and climate change canada meteorological stations http climate weather gc ca within and immediately outside the grw precipitation data from the individual stations were spatially interpolated onto a 1000 m 1000 m grid using ordinary kriging with a linear semivariogram and then applied to the hgs model as a specified flux boundary condition over the land surface model calibration for the three individual time periods was carried out using the method presented in hwang et al 2015 where actual evapotranspiration rates within the contributing areas of 15 surface water monitoring locations fig 2b were iteratively adjusted in order to optimize the fit between simulated and observed surface water flow rates groundwater levels at 18 locations across the watershed fig 2b were used as calibration targets for the subsurface flow component of the steady state models steady state flow fields were developed to reproduce the average monthly hydrologic conditions that existed in the grw when acesulfame sampling was conducted in order to minimize the dispersion effects occurring at the interface between the surface and subsurface domains i e hyporheic zones longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were assigned as 1 m and 0 1 m respectively for the surface and subsurface domains the effective diffusion coefficient of acesulfame was set to 10 10 m2 s within the context of maintaining model parsimony perrin et al 2001 we assume that only the 11 largest wwtps serve as sources of acesulfame for the surface water system table 1 an assumption supported by the fact that they represent over 90 of total wwtp discharge in the grw other potential acesulfame sources including residential septic systems and seasonal applications of municipal biosolids to agricultural land were assumed to be relatively minor compared to the wwtp discharges spoelstra et al 2017 subedi and kannan 2014 potential acesulfame inputs from the 17 smaller wwtps were not included because i there is no measured acesulfame data along the tributaries of the grand river ii the contribution of acesulfame loading from the smaller wwtps to the grand river is assumed to be minor because the acesulfame concentrations measured downstream of tributary confluences are lower than those observed immediately upstream from the confluences based on spoelstra et al 2013 and finally iii the discharge capacity and the total treatment population of the smaller wwtps are approximately 7 and 6 of the entire watershed respectively which suggests that the acesulfame loading from the smaller wwtps is minor compared with the wwtps included in the acesulfame simulations grand river municipal water managers working group 2009 although the potential acesulfame sources from residential septic systems agricultural land and smaller wwtps were not included into the model calibrations cumulative acesulfame mass loading rates were estimated with 20 bounds to accommodate the uncertainties related to these uncharacterized acesulfame sources into the grand river acesulfame was introduced into the surface water domain via specified mass flux boundary conditions coincident with the location of the 11 wwtps identified in fig 2a because the measured concentrations are highly dependent on surface flow conditions at the time of sampling acesulfame transport simulations were conducted using monthly average flow conditions for each of the three months when sampling was conducted i e june 2007 september 2007 and april 2009 as a base case simulation the mass loading rates were initially based on average per capita acesulfame estimates provided in spoelstra et al 2013 of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 regarding the population for the mass loading in the base case 2008 population was used which is the average year of the three sampling campaigns performed by spoelstra et al 2013 the population for 2008 at each wwtp was estimated by interpolating population changes between 2006 and 2011 reported by statistics canada table 1 the population served by some smaller wwtps was accounted for by estimating average per capita acesulfame loading to the grand river specifically a total population of approximately 22 580 which drayton arthur st jacobs and elmira wwtps serve was added to the population for the waterloo wwtp which is located downstream of the four smaller wwtps similarly a population of approximately 11 800 for the paris wwtp was included into the population of the brantford wwtp during the acesulfame transport model calibration per capita acesulfame loading rates from each wwtp and for each of the three months considered were adjusted in order to assess the sensitivity of in stream concentrations to mass input rates 2 3 4 e coli transport under transient flow transient monthly average flow was simulated for the january 2010 to december 2012 time interval in order to facilitate e coli transport modelling data from the same meteorological stations employed for the monthly steady state simulations discussed previously were again used however in addition to liquid precipitation temperature was also included in order to incorporate the influence of winter hydrologic processes into the simulation the winter process modelling was carried out external to the transient flow simulations with the specific objective of determining monthly average liquid precipitation snow accumulation and snowmelt rainfall plus snowmelt output from the winter process modelling was applied to the transient flow model as a specified flux surface boundary condition model parameters for controlling the winter processes were determined in an iterative manner during model calibration with the final temperature threshold snow density and melting constant set at 0 c 100 kg m 3 and 1 0 kg day 1 m 2 c 1 respectively model calibration for the april to october time period where evapotranspiration can be considered most significant with respect to its influence on the water budget was again conducted using the method of hwang et al 2015 as described for the steady state scenario however the number of subcatchments for which actual evapotranspiration was iteratively adjusted was limited to three with the surface water monitoring locations represented by upstream west montrose midstream galt and downstream brantford stations along the main stem of the grand river fig 2b groundwater flow calibration for the transient scenarios is based on the comparison between simulated and observed groundwater levels at ten of the 18 groundwater monitoring locations throughout the watershed fig 2b using the calibrated monthly average transient flow model e coli transport simulations were performed to evaluate the relative contributions of wwtps to e coli loading to the grand river regarding microbial transport it is important to consider land use influences because micro organism concentrations in surface water are closely related to land use types particularly agriculture schreiber et al 2015 at three sites 1 2 and 3 of the five e coli monitoring sites shown in fig 3 upstream land use is primarily agriculture and forest at the downstream site site 5 a mix of urban agriculture and forest land uses occur see an inset of fig 3 indicating that multiple e coli sources are likely contributing to the surface flow system notwithstanding complicating elements such as naturalized e coli ishii et al 2010 this hypothesis is also supported by previous work conducted in this area dorner et al 2006 2007 and to further characterize the downstream impacts of upstream land use in our case urban wwtp sources we performed a cumulative effect analysis to evaluate the contributions of the 28 wwtps fig 3 for e coli loading to the main reach of the grand river regarding the setup of the e coli transport model e coli loading was applied to the surface water domain of the model via a mass flux boundary condition the transport parameters such as dispersivity and the effective diffusion coefficient were the same as those assigned for the acesulfame transport simulations for sensitivity test purposes simulations were conducted where e coli was considered conservative as well as subject to representative first order decay rates of 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 day 1 blaustein et al 2013 flint 1987 with the expectation that relevant fate processes i e die off grazing and sedimentation are lumped via the decay coefficient kärnä et al 2010 the mass loading rate assigned in the model was static over the three year simulation period and was based on the discharge rates at the wwtps and the maximum acceptable e coli concentration 2000 cfu l 1 in wwtp effluents in ontario canada ministry of the environment and climate change 2016 this assumption represented a maximum acceptable worst case modelling scenario given that observed effluent concentrations at grw wwtps were on average 2000 cfu l 1 region of waterloo 2018 it is important to note that the e coli simulations conducted here are not intended to implicitly reproduce via tuning model parameters observed surface water concentrations loads but are instead intended to provide a relative gauge of cumulative contributions by wwtps in the grw and by extension predicted environmental benchmarks by which to elucidate e coli contributions from non wwtp sources 3 results 3 1 surface water and groundwater hydrology for the quasi steady state conditions simulated and observed surface water flow rates matched very closely for both the low flow june and september 2007 and high flow april 2009 scenarios with the r2 0 97 p 0 05 fig 4 a although the simulated low flows tended to slightly overestimate the observed flows the maximum difference is 2 3 m3 s 1 which equates to approximately 13 of the flow rate at the brantford gauging station under low flow conditions for high flow conditions in the upstream reaches the maximum deviation between the observed and simulated flow is 1 9 m3 s 1 or approximately 2 of the flow rate at brantford under high flow conditions based on the wwtp discharge rates presented in table 1 treatment plant effluent composed 2 6 and 15 9 of total stream flow at brantford during april 2009 and september 2007 respectively the difference in the proportion of wwtp effluent in the main river reach is directly related to natural flow rates being approximately five times higher during the high flow season on account of snowmelt higher groundwater contributions and low evapotranspiration in contrast during the low flow season the water table tends to be lower and evapotranspiration rates are much higher simulated groundwater levels under the quasi steady state conditions also match closely with measured values with an r2 of 0 99 p 0 05 for the temporal scenarios fig 4b across the observation wells that were used for steady state model calibration groundwater levels vary from 195 to 508 m a s l while from the high flow to the low flow seasons groundwater levels decline by approximately 2 m which highlights that the seasonal hydrologic differences are much more pronounced in the surface water system the model was also able to simulate the monthly transient surface water flow rates over the 2010 2012 simulation interval with r2 values ranging from 0 88 at the upstream location to 0 95 and 0 96 at the midstream and downstream locations respectively all p 0 05 fig 5 overall the inter seasonal and inter annual variability in surface water flow rates was adequately reproduced with close correlation between the simulated and observed peak and low flow magnitudes and timing over the entire 3 year transient simulation interval the maximum deviation between simulated and measured surface water flow rates was 26 m3 s 1 which is approximately 78 of the measured stream flow rate at the brantford gauge in october 2012 monthly transient groundwater levels were also adequately reproduced by the model fig 6 like the quasi steady state simulations the transient simulations show that groundwater levels exhibit much lower temporal variability than surface water flow rates over the 3 year simulation period the average water table fluctuation in the wells used for transient model calibration was 4 m while the maximum deviation between simulated and observed levels was 11 m 3 2 acesulfame transport acesulfame was simulated using two different loading scenarios i a uniform per capita rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 based on the estimate made by spoelstra et al 2013 and ii manually tuned loading rates for each wwtp that provided simulation results with optimal upper and lower simulated acesulfame concentration bounds for the measured instream concentrations fig 7 3 2 1 uniform loading rate in the river reaches upstream from the major urban centers and where surface water flow rates are low in comparison to reaches further downstream simulated acesulfame concentrations are highly sensitive to loading rates at the small upstream wwtps fig 7 under low flow conditions i e june and september 2007 the base loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 leads to simulated concentrations in the upstream reaches that are slightly higher than those observed at observation points 7 and 8 fig 7a and b whereas further downstream where flow rates progressively increase differences between simulated and observed acesulfame concentrations tend to diminish along with the relative impact of the uppermost wwtp the spatial variability in the fit between observed and simulated acesulfame concentrations generated from the uniform per capita loading scenario is further highlighted by considering the significant p 0 05 r2 and percent bias pbias values for june and september 2007 linear regressions that consider all sampling points yield an r2 of 0 94 pbias 10 5 and 0 92 pbias 12 6 respectively which indicates that the uniform loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 under the low flow conditions is a reasonable estimation in contrast to the low flow scenarios the fit between observed and simulated acesulfame concentrations under the april 2009 high flow scenario is relatively low with a r2 of 0 53 p 0 05 and 47 1 for pbias fig 7c which suggests that the uniform loading rate is possibly underestimated during the high flow season although there is some discrepancy between the observed and simulated acesulfame concentrations when assuming the per capita loading rate is uniform the general spatial and temporal trends are reproduced reasonably well along the entire length of the grand river for both the low and high flow conditions with the impact of both dilution as a function of flow rate and the location of major urban centers being readily apparent 3 2 2 calibrated acesulfame loading rate notwithstanding the acesulfame dissipation processes identified previously effluent acesulfame concentrations are expected to be affected to some degree by the variable treatment technologies grand river conservation authority 2018 region of waterloo 2018 utilized by wwtps in the grw furthermore differences in the dietary habits of communities and the types of wastewater contributing to the wwtp influents e g industrial storm water all affect resulting acesulfame concentrations therefore the fit between observed and simulated acesulfame concentrations was significantly improved by individually tuning the loading from each wwtp and by utilizing upper and lower 20 20 bounds with the optimized rate fig 7 for low flow conditions the simulated upstream per capita loading was similar to the uniform loading rate but slightly reduced by a factor of 2 5 table 1 in order to bring the simulated concentrations in line with the observed concentrations at sites 1 to 6 however at the two largest wwtps by source population waterloo and kitchener in the model the calibrated loading rates remained in close range to the uniform loading rate at 4 9 12 0 mg person 1 day 1 per capita loading from the other wwtps was variable and ranged from 0 to 24 4 mg person 1 day 1 for low flow conditions it is important to note that the steep rise in acesulfame concentrations observed between observation points 9 and 11 is largely caused by inputs from the two largest wwtps in the grw on the other hand further downstream the individual wwtps have less impact the brantford facility which is the furthest downstream wwtp considered in the simulations highlights the progressive decrease in sensitivity because of the cumulative source effect of the upstream wwtps that masks the acesulfame concentrations discharged from the brantford wwtp even though the per capita loading at the brantford site was greatly reduced during calibration the simulated acesulfame concentrations downstream observation sites 17 23 were still in line with those generated by the simulations where a uniform loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 was employed for high flow conditions the calibrated loading at the uppermost wwtp dundalk was reduced to 0 as there were effectively no acesulfame detections upstream of point 5 however the loading from the waterloo and kitchener wwtps was increased to 11 5 30 5 mg person 1 day 1 in order to match the magnitude of the observed concentration peak coincident with the major urban center similar to the low flow condition the impact from individual wwtps downstream from waterloo and kitchener progressively diminishes under high flow conditions as well as it is the cumulative acesulfame mass input from all upstream wwtps that controls the instream acesulfame concentrations for both the low and high flow scenarios where acesulfame loading rates were tuned during calibration the average per capita loading across all the wwtps considered in the simulations ranged from 3 9 mg person 1 day 1 june 2007 20 scenario to 14 1 mg person 1 day 1 april 2009 20 scenario which envelopes the loading rates calculated by buerge et al 2009 and spoelstra et al 2013 3 3 groundwater surface water interactions 3 3 1 water mass exchange simulated groundwater surface water interactions are highly dynamic in both space and time across the watershed under the low flow conditions fig 8 a the major river reaches tend to gain water from groundwater discharge exfiltration while groundwater recharge infiltration occurs across much of the land surface during high flow conditions fig 8b groundwater discharge is occurring within the majority of rivers and streams as well many low lying depression areas while groundwater recharge is primarily occurring in upland or flat lying regions in general the simulations show that groundwater discharge is much more spatially focused than groundwater recharge which is evidenced by the peak exfiltration and infiltration rates of 5000 mm year 1 and 500 mm year 1 respectively the dynamic nature of groundwater surface water interactions are further elucidated by considering how fluctuations in water table elevations can influence shallow groundwater discharge along river channels processes deemed by lapworth et al 2012 as being an acute knowledge gap in the context of contaminant transport of emerging organic contaminants two dimensional cross sectional perspectives through transect a a shown in the insets of fig 8 depict simulated water table elevation water saturation levels and surface subsurface water exchange rates represented with scaled reference vectors for the low flow and the high flow conditions as the cross section in fig 8a illustrates under low flow conditions the primary groundwater discharge occurs directly beneath the river bed because the water table along the river bank is depressed this in turn limits the opportunity for lateral shallow groundwater discharge to the river which can impact surface water dilution in comparison during high flow conditions fig 8b the elevated water table increases lateral hydraulic gradients and leads to a much higher discharge of the shallow local groundwater adjacent to the river bank in these types of hydrologic settings the contribution of deeper groundwater to river flow under low and high flow conditions is relatively stable compared to shallow groundwater discharge which is highly dependent on the water table elevation 3 3 2 acesulfame mass exchange under both low and high flow conditions the primary transport mechanism for acesulfame to move from the surface water into the groundwater is by hydrodynamic dispersion mass exchange within the hyporheic zones along the rivers with diffusion being the primary driver as advective mass movement is limited by the major rivers being primarily groundwater discharge zones see insets of fig 9 a and b under low flow conditions fig 9a the peak rate of acesulfame infiltration from the surface water into near stream shallow groundwater is slightly higher than the peak rate of acesulfame exfiltration from shallow groundwater into the surface water at 2600 and 1900 ng l 1 year 1 respectively whereas under high flow conditions fig 9b the peak infiltration rate is less than the peak rate of exfiltration at 2000 and 3000 ng l 1 year 1 respectively the higher rate of acesulfame discharge under high flow conditions highlights the increased opportunity that exists for flushing contaminants out of the shallow groundwater system under wet conditions when water table elevation and groundwater discharge rates increase 3 4 e coli transport when evaluating the performance of the e coli simulations it is important to acknowledge the large spatial and temporal variability in the measured data fig 10 a for which loading rates based on constant point source concentrations would be difficult to prescribe as an example geometric mean concentrations at sites 1 2 and 3 were 400 2000 and 700 cfu l 1 with respective standard deviation in log10 of 3 1 3 8 and 3 7 these large variations in the e coli concentration profiles indicate that surface water in this area is affected by various e coli sources as reported by dorner et al 2007 this is further reinforced by the modelling results fig 10b and c which indicate that conservative e coli decay rates λ 0 0 day 1 black dotted line assigned to all the wwtps lead to considerable underestimates of concentrations at observation sites 1 fig 10b and 5 observed geometric mean 1942 cfu l 1 fig 10c the geometric mean of the simulated e coli concentration using the λ 0 0 day 1 value at site 1 is 13 cfu l 1 and at site 5 is 52 cfu l 1 which in both cases is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the observation geometric mean by increasing the decay rate the simulated e coli concentrations decrease further and the difference for a simulation with a decay rate of 3 d 1 is larger than two orders of magnitude there are similarities between simulated e coli and acesulfame behavior with e coli simulation results also demonstrating that wwtp derived concentrations are heavily influenced by dilution with instream concentrations being highest during low flow conditions and lowest during high flow conditions the simulation results also demonstrate that the influence of decay on e coli concentrations between observation sites and upstream wwtps is inversely proportional to the flow as higher velocities reduce travel time and hence also reduce the opportunity for time dependent bacteria die off fig 10b and c under the e coli discharge scenario with λ 0 0 day 1 that considers 28 wwtps in the grw all discharging effluent with an e coli concentration of 2000 cfu l 1 we analysed the relative contribution of each wwtp to the e coli loading at the midstream and watershed outlet points fig 11 the midstream point is located in between waterloo 11 and kitchener 12 wwtps and the watershed outlet point is located at the mouth of the grand river at lake erie the average relative contribution of the waterloo 11 wwtp at the midstream point is approximately 80 of the total simulated wwtp derived e coli concentration in the river and the contributions from other wwtps are minor or negligible except for fergus wwtp 4 which contributes about 5 at the watershed outlet the relative contribution of the upstream wwtps declines in importance relative to the additional 17 wwtps 12 28 downstream of the mid point the major contributors of the simulated e coli at the watershed outlet point are waterloo 11 kitchener 12 guelph 13 galt 16 and brantford 23 wwtps for which total attributed contribution is about 80 using this sensitivity analysis method monitoring locations can be optimized for detecting or identifying contaminant sources discharged from wastewater treatment plants in a watershed 4 discussion reproducing surface water flow rates is arguably the most important component in a concentration based assessment of surface water contamination derived from continuous mass loading scenarios this contention holds true here where the loading of both acesulfame and e coli are represented by constant mass fluxes into the surface water domain while the simulated contaminant levels could have been reported in terms of loads the resulting time series data would fail to depict the dynamic interplay between the surface water flow characteristics and concentrations which is an important consideration given that surface water quality criteria are often stipulated in terms of concentrations furthermore by calculating surface water concentrations we were able to identify the sensitivity of simulated instream concentration levels to flow rates during both high and low flow conditions as expected the simulated instream acesulfame concentrations were sensitive to loading rates while the uniform loading rate of 7 14 mg person 1 day 1 spoelstra et al 2013 provided a reasonable fit to observed concentration levels along the main reach of the grand river model performance was greatly improved by adjusting individual wwtp loading rates having to represent the wwtp loadings individually in the model is not unexpected as it can be surmised that the per capita consumption of acesulfame can be quite variable over time and space indeed the acesulfame loading rates based on the measured wwtp effluent samples were approximately 5 39 0 67 mg person 1 day 1 in kitchener june 2007 march 2008 and september 2013 5 64 0 81 mg person 1 day 1 in waterloo march 2008 and september 2013 and 3 75 mg person 1 day 1 in guelph september 2013 comparatively the estimated mass loading rates including low and high flow seasons range from 4 87 to 16 66 mg person 1 day 1 in kitchener from 7 85 to 30 51 mg person 1 day 1 in waterloo and from 1 22 to 8 05 mg person 1 day 1 in guelph overall the estimated mass loading rates overlap with measured rates for the kitchener and guelph wwtp facilities with a slight positive bias in the estimated values whereas even the lowest estimated loading rate for the waterloo wwtp 7 85 mg person 1 day 1 was 2 21 mg person 1 day 1 higher than the mean measured value large variability in estimates of per capita acesulfame consumption is not unexpected previous work by buerge et al 2009 identified the mean per capita acesulfame loading from wastewater in and around zurich switzerland to be 11 mg person 1 day 1 with a standard deviation of 4 2 as such even the adjusted overall average per capita consumption values applied in this study ranging from 5 0 to 11 7 mg person 1 day 1 are comparable in terms of both magnitude and variability it should also be noted that the adjustments made here to the wwtp loading rates for acesulfame may have been at least in part compensating for simulated flow biases and acesulfame degradation effects scheurer et al 2014 during low flow conditions the input acesulfame loading in the upper reaches was systematically reduced conversely during high flow conditions the prescribed acesulfame loading at the two largest wwtps along the river course was increased in order for the model to better match the notable spike in observed concentrations downstream of the major urban center within the watershed one of the novel aspects of utilizing a fully integrated physics based model to simulate the downstream migration of wwtp effluent is that the spatially and temporally variable mass exchange between surface water and groundwater is dynamically represented as already noted these exchanges can be critical in the context of dilution and flushing of contaminants and are underrepresented in watershed scale chemical microbial transport modelling initiatives lapworth et al 2012 in the case of the acesulfame simulations conducted here the inclusion of a hydrodynamic mass exchange between the surface water and the groundwater provided the principal mechanism for wwtp derived contaminant mass to enter the shallow near stream groundwater or riparian systems hyporheic zone along the grand river regarding the solute mass exchange in the hyporheic zone there have been many studies conducted for investigating physico chemical biological interactions e g boano et al 2014 castro and hornberger 1991 chow et al 2019 hancock 2002 jacobs et al 1988 nagorski and moore 1999 in a recent river reach scale study chow et al 2019 investigated solute mass exchange in the hyporheic zone surrounding a stream meander and found flow paths in the surface water system penetrated through the hyporheic zone thus indicating that shallow groundwater quality can be directly affected by solute mass in the surface water system similarly but at a much larger scale results herein show that the hyporheic zone along the grand river also facilitates solute mass infiltration and exfiltration during both low and high flow conditions additionally previous smaller scale integrated modelling studies jones et al 2006 liggett et al 2015 park et al 2011 have identified hydrodynamic dispersion to be an important chemical transport process in the context of groundwater surface water interactions the simulations generated here corroborate the importance of hydrodynamic dispersion and represent a rare example of the impact of this process at a watershed scale furthermore by identifying the flow rate induced differences in acesulfame mass exchange the simulation results suggest how surface water solute loading could be exacerbated under high flow conditions due to shallow groundwater flushing that drives contaminants back into the river nagorski and moore 1999 in the case of the more recalcitrant chemicals such as acesulfame derived from long term continuous point sources such as wwtps this seasonal or event driven flushing of shallow groundwater has the capability to significantly alter the surface water temporal loading patterns beyond what would be expected from a continuous source alone although not the focus of this study it can be anticipated that this type of watershed scale transport phenomena can have a significant impact on water quality at downstream surface water receptors which in the case of this study is lake erie as with previous watershed scale fib studies frey et al 2013 harmel et al 2010 lyautey et al 2010 wilkes et al 2011 the results from this study also point to the importance of characterizing non point sources in order to comprehensively reproduce a watershed scale natural system this requirement is widely recognized by the community of modelers who utilize hydrologic response unit hru based models such as swat e g cho et al 2012 coffey et al 2010 parajuli et al 2009 to simulate in stream bacteria loads and the results from this work indeed show that this necessity holds true for integrated physics based modelling approaches as well while the results here demonstrate that characterizing point source contributions of major wwtps is necessary in the simulation of fib in urbanized watersheds characterizing diffuse agriculture and wildlife sources inputs in the model would be a necessity for simulations to reproduce observed surface water fib densities in mixed use watersheds recently wilkes et al 2019 showed that in stream near stream fib reservoirs in small drainage ditches overwhelmingly dominated median 99 e coli loads in the ditches in relation to tile drainage contributions that being said for any work focusing specifically on the impact of wwtp derived fib loading on downstream water quality the point source based integrated modelling approach demonstrated here provides novel insights on how the groundwater and surface water flow systems can influence instream contaminant behavior across a range of meteorological conditions finally the relative contribution of contaminants discharged from multiple wwtps can be quantified using the sensitivity analysis that frames the results in a cumulative effects context 5 conclusions this study successfully applied a high resolution physics based groundwater surface water model to a watershed scale 6800 km2 flow and transport problem considering the scale and hydrologic complexity of the model domain surface flow rates and groundwater levels were reproduced well under both steady state and transient conditions by incorporating multiple wwtps as point sources within the model framework the cumulative measured concentration profile of acesulfame which was treated here as a conservative tracer was reproduced by the model for the main river reaches within the watershed acesulfame was demonstrated to be a valuable tracer for validating both the flow and transport components of the model and as such we feel acesulfame can be used to help characterize large scale spatially and temporally variable groundwater surface water interactions in systems impacted by wwtps the simulation results show that wwtp locations stream order and antecedent hydrologic conditions have a strong influence on the simulated acesulfame concentrations in the low order river reaches simulated acesulfame concentrations based on average per capita consumption estimates tended to slightly exceed the measured concentrations with the deviation being amplified during low flow conditions in part because of the challenge in reproducing low surface water flow rates within low order streams in watershed scale models in the higher order reaches downstream from the largest wwtps the simulated acesulfame concentrations generally matched well with measured concentrations although under high flow conditions loading rates based on average per capita consumption led to simulated concentrations that somewhat underestimated observed values overall the results indicate that simple acesulfame loading estimates can be effectively utilized to assist with calibration and validation of physically rigorous flow and transport models for a worst case effluent concentration scenario of wwtp impacts on fib levels along the main river reach the simulations suggest that wwtps only modestly impact downstream e coli levels as the simulated concentrations were about two orders of magnitude lower than the downstream measured e coli concentrations this finding is promising from a wwtp cumulative effects standpoint for many targets in a watershed with dozens of wwtp facilities gillis 2012 additionally measured e coli levels in upstream reaches as well as e coli concentration peaks during high flow runoff conditions highlight the fact that other sources i e agriculture and wildlife can be notable if not dominant contributors to in stream concentrations loads based on the outcome from this work including the sensitivity analysis fully integrated physics based models warrant further applications as tools to help understand cumulative loading impacts on watershed scale surface water and groundwater quality from both a chemical and microbiological perspective declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18887,the large volumes of oily wastewater generated by various industries such as oil and gas food and beverage and metal processing need to be de oiled prior to being discharged into the environment compared to conventional technologies such as dissolved air flotation daf coagulation or solvent extraction membrane filtration can treat oily wastewater of a much broader compositional range and still ensure high oil removals in the present review various aspects related to the practical implementation of membranes for the treatment of oily wastewater are summarized first sources and composition of oily wastewater regulations that stipulate the extent of treatment needed before discharge and the conventional technologies that enable such treatment are appraised second commercially available membranes membrane modules operation modes and hybrids are overviewed and their economics are discussed third challenges associated with membrane filtration are examined along with means to quantify and mitigate membrane fouling finally perspectives on state of the art techniques to facilitate better monitoring and control of such systems are briefly discussed keywords membrane fouling oil water separation oil emulsion fouling mitigation on line monitoring membrane modification 1 introduction oil water mixtures are found in many industrial processes and can take the form of a product a by product or a waste stream whether the goal is for recovering the oil for economic gains or removing the oil phase for environmentally friendly disposal the separation of the oil and other immiscible components is necessary environmental regulations governing the discharge of oily wastewater have become increasingly stricter with country specific regulatory limits on the maximum oil concentration of generally within the 5 40 mg l range daud et al 2015 the oil phase in wastewater can exist in three forms classified based on the size of the oil droplets cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 namely free oil 150 μm dispersed oil 20 150 μm and emulsified oil 20 μm the choice and performance of oil water separation techniques depend not only on oil droplet size but also on other considerations such as oil concentration and chemical composition membrane filtration is a promising technology for separating oil droplets smaller than 10 μm padaki et al 2015 notably the increasing interest in the employment of membrane filtration for the treatment of oily wastewater is evident in the significant increase in the number of publications over the last three decades 1988 2018 vis à vis more conventional methods as depicted in fig 1 correspondingly a review of the advances to date on this topic is warranted unfortunately membrane fouling is a major drawback that reduces productivity and increases operational costs of membrane filtration many efforts have been dedicated to understanding the mechanisms of membrane fouling and to develop methods to effectively monitor and mitigate membrane fouling the focus of the review is on the practical aspects of applying pressure driven membranes to the treatment of oily wastewaters highlighting the requirements recent development drawbacks and corresponding mitigation strategies in the first section of this paper we review the common sources and properties of oily wastewater the discharge regulations as well as technologies that have been used to treat oily wastewater in the subsequent section the advantages of using membranes for the treatment of oily wastewater commercially will be reviewed along with the related challenges and counter measures in the final section we review the state of the art technologies of monitoring and mitigating membrane fouling and discuss the potential of membranes for the treatment of oily wastewater 1 1 oily wastewater sources quantities and composition oily wastewater is a by product generated by many industries including oil and gas food and beverage shipping and maritime tanning textile and metal and machining cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 mueller et al 1997 oily wastewater not only adversely affects the environment if not adequately treated but also represents a substantial economic loss if the oil is not recovered oil water separation has received renewed interest with the recent developments in the fossil fuel sector particularly for the treatment of produced water which is oily wastewater stream from the oil and gas extraction operations cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 daud et al 2015 produced water is generated from onshore as well as offshore wells the global produced water generated is approximated at 250 million barrels day for every 80 million barrels day of oil produced with 800 million m3 of produced water were discharged from offshore facilities throughout the world in 2003 alone fakhru l razi et al 2009 neff et al 2011 the treatment of the enormous volume of produced water is important from both an environmental perspective to reduce water consumption and minimize waste disposal and also from an economic perspective as expenses on water management can account for 5 15 of drilling costs fakhru l razi et al 2009 neff et al 2011 other than oil complex constituents in produced water include many type of chemicals such as linear chain hydrocarbons aromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene and xylene metals naturally occurring radioactive material norm and additive chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors and emulsion destabilizers cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 mueller et al 1997 neff et al 2011 the composition of produced water as well as its physical and chemical properties are generally site specific neff et al 2011 in the food drink and milk industry water is a significant component in most products mavrov and bélières 2000 and also is involved in many steps and processes such as washing rinsing mixing pasteurizing etc casani et al 2005 because the amount of oily wastewater produced is also large the implementation of means for reuse is cost effective due the economies of scale vourch et al 2008 most of the oil waste comes from meat poultry seafood and dairy thus the wastewater typically has a very high content of organic carbon another major producer of oily wastewater is the metal processing industry where cutting oil is used as a coolant and flushing fluid cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 seo et al 2007 cutting oils are emulsions consisting of oil water and additives such as fatty acids surfactants heavy metals and biocides perez et al 2007 the oil content in such waste streams is too low for it to be incinerated yet they are too toxic to be treated biologically in summary oily wastewater from various industries tends to be of very complex and varied compositions which complicates the selection of an appropriate treatment technology and calls for context specific treatment solutions 1 2 regulations for discharging oily wastewater the direct discharge of oily wastewater into the environment without proper treatment can have grave consequences including the disruption of the aqueous ecosystem pollution of the groundwater or drinking water resources and endangering human health yu et al 2017 region specific regulations have been introduced to enforce the treatment of oily wastewater prior to its discharge to the environment in the north sea region oslo paris ospar convention regulates that the upper limit for the discharge of oil content in the wastewater is 30 mg l dickhout et al 2017 according to the paris convention the upper limit of oil content to be discharged to the sea is 40 mg l for the offshore fields and 5 mg l for the on land fields holdich et al 1998 in the u s the environmental protection agency epa stipulates a maximum oil content of 72 mg l for any 24 h period and 45 mg l over a 30 days period chen et al 1991 other studies reported on regulations with similar limits of oil concentration that can be released into the open water e g maximum oil content of 40 mg l typical range around 10 15 mg l mueller et al 1997 vasanth et al 2013 in norway the limit on the oil concentration allowed to be discharged into the sea from an offshore installation to the norwegian continental shelf was reduced from 40 to 30 mg l as of 2007 which implies the increased stringency in the quality of the discharge in china the upper limit for oil concentration in the discharged wastewater is 10 mg l yu et al 2017 these regulations compel an urgent need for developing technologies that can reach these treatment goals cost efficiently the common technologies for treating oily waste water are discussed in the next section 1 3 oily wastewater treatment conventional technologies an overview of the common technologies used in treating oily wastewater is provided in table 1 along with the oil concentration ranges in the feed and the removal effectiveness an et al 2017 daud et al 2015 fakhru l razi et al 2009 each method has its own challenges in treating oily wastewater 2 membrane technology for oil water separation membrane based separation is the most cost effective solution for removing oil droplets smaller than 10 μm frankiewicz 2001 the amount of oil in the emulsified fraction can be significant making the removal of these droplets a prerequisite for meeting environmental regulations separation methods based on the oil water density differential e g settling flotation hydrocyclone require an exceedingly long retention time for the removal of emulsified oil while chemical treatment e g fentone process coagulation may not effectively de stabilize oil in water emulsions particularly when the emulsified oil is finely dispersed kajitvichyanukul et al 2011 compared to the conventional methods membrane filtration offers several advantages that include higher quality permeate lower space footprint more straightforward automation no need for extraneous chemicals and therefore reduced waste and lower energy input mondal and wickramasinghe 2008 mueller et al 1997 szep and kohlheb 2010 yang et al 2015 these advantages coupled with the ability of membranes to reject other pollutants present in the feed make membranes competitive with the more traditional technologies as with all membrane filtration processes the key drawback that limits the broader implementation of membrane based oil water separations is membrane fouling cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 which is the cumulative deposition of the feed constituents like oil on the surface of the membrane and inside the pores that results in a decline in the permeate flux and quality other limitations of membrane technology include lower throughput e g much lower than that of hydrocyclones and relatively higher capital costs given that membrane based separation is most effective for the oil droplet size range of 1 10 μm ultrafiltration uf and tighter microfiltration mf are the more relevant choices bilstad and espedal 1996 however if the wastewater is saline and desalination is an accompanying treatment goal employing reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf can allow for a single step processing of such waste streams cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 membrane distillation md also shows promise gryta and karakulski 1999 han et al 2017 tan et al 2017 velioğlu et al 2018 in this section commercially available membranes are discussed followed by membrane modules then batch and continuous modes the last two sub sections focus on hybrid or integrated membrane processes and the economics of the membrane process 2 1 commercially available membranes for oily industrial wastewater the membrane based processing of oily wastewaters sometimes combined with conventional methods has been successfully implemented in more than 3000 polymeric uf mf installations and over 75 inorganic ceramic ones worldwide since 20 years ago cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 according to a report by grand view research inc the global market for the treatment of produced water which is the major wastewater in the oil and gas industry reached 5 81 billion in 2015 of which 46 8 was for secondary separation technologies including membrane based techniques inc 2016 several companies such as osmonics koch alcoa veolia and filtration solution inc offer commercial membranes for oil water separation table 2 presents a list of some of the membranes available on the market currently osmonics and filtration solutions inc offer spiral wound ultrafiltration membrane modules to concentrate oily wastewater streams m series ultrafilic and shp series membranes respectively incorporated 2016 lenntech 2002 both membranes are made from a chemically modified polyacrylonitrile pan and designed to protect the membrane from fouling by free oil and from degradation by solvents to minimize fouling these membranes have been engineered to be extremely hydrophilic i e water contact angle of 40 relative to the conventional polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf and polysulfone ps membranes that are hydrophobic lenntech 2002 in addition both membranes can operate at temperatures of up to 50 c and can withstand ph values in the range from 2 to 10 for continuous operation and from 3 to 9 for when cleaning in place cip is incorporated into the process typical permeate fluxes are 8 34 l m2 h for the m series ultrafilic membranes and 17 43 l m2 h for the shp series membranes incorporated 2016 lenntech 2002 numerous membrane companies offer integrated treatment systems to process oily industrial wastewater akvola technologies established a flotation filtration system akvofloat that can lower both energy consumption and footprint technologies 2017 of treatment the system consists of two stages that are integrated in the same tank the first stage is flotation whereby the suspended oil is carried to the surface by bubbles with the aid of the akvola microbubble generator which induces fine gas bubbles using low pressure air nitrogen ozone or carbon dioxide co2 the role of the microbubbles is to attach to the oil droplets and particles which are carried to the surface and then continuously skimmed off the second stage entails membrane filtration with submerged ceramic membranes d p o r e 0 2 μm positioned below the float layer technologies 2017 cdm smith is currently marketing a hybrid system to treat produced water containing up to 20 000 mg l of total dissolved solids this system combines several commercially available technologies namely microfiltration mf ion exchange uv disinfection and reverse osmosis ro the pretreatment consists of filtering the feed solution through prefiltration cartridge filter with a nominal pore size of 1 3 μm to remove particulates followed by ion exchange to remove polycations and then uv disinfection to reduce bacterial activity finally the water undergoes a multi stage ro process employing a combination of low pressure ro capable of achieving 85 recovery and seawater ro membranes 80 water recovery k guerra 2011 veolia water technologies offers a produced water system opus optimized pretreatment and unique separation technology which consists of multiple treatment processes namely chemical softening via multiflo with filtration followed by ion exchange then ro the pretreatment processes before the ro step are designed to reduce the hardness and suspended solids in the feed solution eliminating the potential for precipitative and colloidal fouling of the ro membranes loganathan et al 2015 clean water tech pte ltd provided a uf hollow fiber membrane with pore size ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 μm which was made from hydrophilized polyacrylonitrile ultra flo u630c the ph range that this membrane could tolerate was 2 12 and the maximum feed pressure and temperature possible were respectively 3 5 bar and 50 c in addition a ro composite polyamide spiral wound membrane swc3 from hydraunatics could handle feeds with ph ranged from 3 to 10 and maximum operating pressure and temperature of 83 bar and 45 c respectively miller et al 2013 these examples of commercially available membranes indicate the practical feasibility of such processes in the last two decades the focus on the treatment of oily wastewater has made available membranes that can withstand reasonable ranges of temperature pressure and ph to cater to the complexities of such feeds 2 2 membrane modules different kinds of membrane types and modules and system have been employed in oil water separation processes in the past two decades table 3 the common module designs are flat sheet spiral wound tubular capillary and hollow fiber with flat sheet and tubular being more popular flat sheet modules are commonly employed in research laboratories for bench scale experimentation the advantages include relative simplicity of module design and operation and availability of wide range of pore sizes spanning ro nf uf and mf however one of the key advantages is that the membrane area per unit module volume is low and thereby less feasible for commercial implementation because of the larger footprint necessary nonetheless flat sheet membranes form the basis for the dominant ro module namely the spiral wound membrane swm module which is a stack of flat sheet membranes with spacers between the sheets rolled and placed inside a cylindrical case such a packing method significantly enhances the availability of membrane area per unit module volume for filtration tubular membranes capillary and hollow fiber membranes differ by the lumen size inner lumen diameters greater than 0 635 cm between 0 1 and 0 635 cm and between 0 025 and 0 1 cm respectively most of the ceramic membranes which have greater mechanical strength as well as chemical and thermal stability are tubular the drawback is the limited availability of such membranes to only uf and mf one of the chief advantages of hollow fiber membranes is the greatest membrane area per unit volume vis à vis tubular and flat sheet ones which is giving this membrane type more attention in the membrane community 2 3 membrane filtration in batch or continuous operation modes membranes can be operated either in batch or continuous mode most of the separation processes in the industry are performed in the continuous mode whereby the feed stream is continuously flowed through the unit thus the feed concentration remains relatively constant in contrast for batch processing the feed stream becomes increasingly concentrated with time due to the permeation of water to the permeate side and thus increasing the fouling tendency batch processing is useful if the concentrated retentate is one of the desired product also along with the permeate in the following sub sections the reports on batch and continuous membrane based processes for oily wastewater are summarized 2 3 1 batch processing most of the reports on the use of membrane in de oiling application in the batch mode are on treating the oily wastewater from the olive oil milling process stoller and chianese optimized the uf and nf batch process for the purification of the olive washing wastewater by using the critical flux concept stoller and chianese 2006 specifically the critical flux was determined for various concentrations then employed as the basis for choosing the permeate flux value near and below the critical flux in order to delay the fouling and extend the membrane lifetime particularly as the feed got more concentrated in the batch process the reason for using the batch mode was its operability with a smaller active membrane area at a smaller scale relative to the continuous mode membrane fouling however was worse for the batch system with time the system consisted of a continuous aerobic biological reactor followed by a swm uf batch system and then the nf batch process after which the purified water was discharged to the municipal sewage system the results show that by implementing a permeate flux based on the critical flux help extend membrane lifetime and decrease fouling another study on deoiling olive mill wastewater used an integrated mf nf system followed by either osmotic distillation od or vacuum membrane distillation vmd garcia castello et al 2010 the mf system was employed in a batch concentration mode at 0 72 bar and 22 c while the nf batch system was operated at 20 c and 8 bar this integrated system was used to recover and concentrate the polyphenols from the olive mill wastewater with 78 of polyphenols recovered in the mf system and the rest recovered by the nf the vmd had a higher flux but required a higher power consumption in comparison to the od system due to the need for a vacuum pump or a refrigeration step for condensing the permeate paraskeva et al studied a batch process for treating olive mill wastewater by integrating uf nf and ro at various values of temperature and transmembrane pressure tmp paraskeva et al 2007 at the pretreatment step a ceramic ultrafilter with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm was operated at 15 35 c and 1 2 5 bar the nf ro hybrid system used polymeric membranes mwcos of 200 da and 100 da for nf and ro respectively operated at tmp values of 10 30 bar and 30 40 bar for nf and ro respectively batch processing is employed mainly to recover or retain certain desired product from the oily wastewater which means the retentate rather than the permeate is the valuable component in such cases the batch mode is preferred since the lower feed volume vis à vis continuous processing allows for better control of the retentate quality and the capital costs are lower the drawback is the lifetime of the membrane since the progressive concentration of the product in the retentate inevitably leads to extensive membrane fouling which necessitates more frequent membrane cleaning or replacement 2 3 2 continuous flow processing the continuous flow mode is more suitable for treating large amounts of oily wastewater as is the case for example in the oil and gas industry ebrahimi et al used continuous processing for treating produced water using an integration system that included mf dissolved air floatation daf as well as crossflow uf cfuf and nf systems ebrahimi et al 2010 the mf membrane was made of aluminum oxide al2o3 and had a pore size in the 0 1 0 2 μm range while the uf and nf membranes were made of titanium dioxide tio2 and had mwcos of 20 000 uf 1000 and 750 da nf respectively the process was carried out by directing the produced water continuously through the mf unit followed by a batch daf unit and finally by the continuous cfuf or nf system all the units were operated at tmp values ranging from 0 5 to 2 bar crossflow velocities of 0 6 1 3 m s and feed concentrations ranging from 32 to 5420 mg l of oil most of the oil 93 was removed by mf with rest of the process train ensuring 99 5 total removal of oil polymeric membranes such as pvdf have also been employed for the continuous processing of oily wastewater obaid et al 2017 specifically the surface morphology was modified by hydrophilic microspheres on the pvdf membrane surface turning the membrane from naturally hydrophobic to super hydrophilic the permeate flux when treating the oil emulsion was 2 700 l m2 h which was significantly higher in comparison to the pristine hydrophobic pvdf membrane and the oil rejection was up to 99 continuous processing is mostly used to treat oily wastewater from various industries prior to discharge into the environment to comply to the regulations the main focus in such cases is to purify the water as much as possible to allow for safe release into the environment with negligible impact to the ecosystem and reuse in the plant although the main target is the volume of the treated water the retained oil also has economic value the other advantage of the continuous mode is the feed flow that provides a tangential shear at the membrane surface to mitigate membrane fouling thereby prolonging the lifetime of the membrane 2 4 hybrid membrane processes oily wastewater can have a very complex composition and contain suspended and dissolved species that differ in concentration size charge and density in order to achieve a sustainable membrane based separation of oily wastewater it is often necessary to integrate the membrane unit with other membranes whether in batch or continuous processes as described previously or other conventional unit processes such integration may ease the foulant load on the membrane thereby mitigating membrane fouling and prolonging the membrane lifetime membrane fouling can be mitigated using adequate pretreatment different physical biological and chemical methods have been used for the pretreatment of oily wastewater these include gas sparging ducom et al 2002 fouladitajar et al 2016 coagulation karakulski and morawski 2002 flocculation zhong et al 2003 centrifugation karakulski and morawski 2002 electrocoagulation milic et al 2016 acidification wang et al 2016 cartridge pre filtration karakulski and morawski 2002 dissolved air flotation daf zouboulis and avranas 2000 activated carbon adsorption mohammadi and esmaeelifar 2005 as well as separation by larger pore size membranes such as uf hilal et al 2004 karakulski et al 1995 liu 2016 and mf daiminger et al 1995 karakulski and morawski employed an integrated membrane system based on uf and nf to treat waste oil water emulsion from a cable factory karakulski and morawski 2002 fig 2 uf with 100 kda mwco membranes resulted in 99 rejection of suspended solids and retention of oil and lubricants the resulting uf permeate was further purified by nf to reject the remaining pollutants and reduce the content of copper ions i e dominant constituent in the oily wastewater from the cable factory another study proposed a hybrid system that used flocculation as a pretreatment zhong et al 2003 by coupling this pretreatment with the downstream mf with a 0 2 μm pore size zirconia membrane the permeate flux was increased and permeate quality improved in comparison with mf alone one study utilized adsorption with membrane filtration for treating oily wastewater and demonstrated that the integration increased the permeate quality and reduced membrane fouling rasouli et al 2017 powdered activated carbon pac and natural zeolite were compared in terms of the effectiveness as adsorbents at the mf pretreatment stage total organic carbon toc removal was up to 99 5 and 99 9 respectively for pac and zeolite with the latter performing better due to the higher oil adsorption rate and thereby lower fouling of the mf membrane in another study on treating industrial oily wastewater with 550 mg oil l of oil and 6500 mg cod l coagulation coupled with mf was used as a pretreatment step for uf cheng and gong 2018 polyaluminum chloride was the coagulant used in combination with a ceramic 0 2 μm pore size mf membrane followed by a pvdf uf membrane unit the results demonstrated that the uf permeate flux increased 2 5 times compared to the process without pretreatment the entire integrated system achieved up to 95 2 of cod reduction and 98 5 oil removal which was much better than what could be accomplished with the standalone units or with any other couplings other types of coagulation have also been integrated with membrane units an example of which is electrocoagulation ec with ro rodrigues pires da silva et al 2015 in this study with feeds containing 1000 mg oil l ec functioned as a pretreatment step using either ac or dc current after which the effluent was left in a sedimentation tank for 5 min before going through the ro unit while ec gave 92 reduction of cod which was sufficient alone to meet the current regulations for discharge to the sea the subsequent ro unit achieved 100 removal of cod the ec unit was also used in another study with mf to treat the oily wastewater from a drilling site changmai et al 2019 as shown by fig 3 membrane technology complements rather than replaces the conventional methods for treating oily wastewater to achieve a higher quality product sustainably the integration of membrane based and other methods harnesses the advantages and also circumvents the shortcomings of each 2 5 economics of membrane based treatment of oily wastewater as mentioned earlier membrane technology is economically advantageous for oily wastewater treatment compared to the other conventional technologies based on the numbers available in literature the cost of membrane based treatment was estimated to be 1 3 m3 cheryan 1998 cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 which compares favorably with that for is 3 65 m3 cost of treatment by dissolved air floatation daf the cost inevitably depends on the source of the oily wastewater since each industry has unique blends of oil and grease as well as other foulants specific to the process for example the total cost including costs of membranes labor electricity cleaning and maintenance of treating oily wastewater from the fatty acid industry was 2 65 m3 dangel et al 1995 that from the railroad industry was 1 03 1 48 m3 while that for the metalworking wastewater using uf was 2 8 m3 cheryan 1998 in another study using mf nandi and coworkers estimated that the annual cost of the membrane based treatment for oily wastewater with an oil concentration of 50 mg l could be as little as 0 098 m3 for treating feeds at 100 m3 day nandi et al 2009 clearly the cost of membrane based treatment of oily wastewater is quite varied but is nevertheless lower than that for conventional technologies moreover more recently the cost of membrane based treatment has been slashed due to improvements in membrane fabrication and operation as a benchmark the total water treatment cost by ro desalination was around 0 5 m3 whereas that by the conventional thermal process was in the range of 0 8 1 1 m3 judd 2017 as another benchmark the total cost for treating a secondary agriculture based effluent stream was around 0 15 0 42 m3 bick et al 2012 3 the challenges of membrane operation 3 1 mechanisms of membrane fouling by oil the key obstacle that hinders the widespread implementation of membrane technology for oil water separation is membrane fouling notably the underlying mechanisms of membrane fouling by emulsified oil remains poorly understood for example the conditions under which the accumulated oil forms compressible cakes or contiguous films are unclear several studies have analyzed permeate flux decline during the filtration of oil in water emulsions and used blocking filtration laws one of the first reports was by hermia 1982 to explain the mechanisms of membrane fouling by oil abbasi et al 2011 koltuniewicz and field 1996 koltuniewicz et al 1995 mohammadi et al 2003 ohya et al 1998 salahi et al 2010 two studies abbasi et al 2011 nandi et al 2009 showed that membrane fouling by oil is due to cake formation whereby multiple layers of oil form a secondary membrane on the membrane surface other researchers linked membrane fouling by oil to intermediate pore blocking whereby the membrane is fouled by early stages of cake filtration and complete pore blocking abbasi et al 2011 koltuniewicz et al 1995 nandi et al 2009 six out of the seven aforementioned studies applied the blocking filtration laws to crossflow filtration although the hermia blocking laws hermia 1982 do not take into account the back transport of particles away from the membrane surface and only account for spherical non deformable particles oil droplets which can both deform and coalesce are unique foulants that challenge the available knowhow on fouling another study investigated the fouling of nf and uf membranes using hexadecane in water emulsions stabilized by different surfactants namely a non ionic surfactant triton x 100 anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzensulfonate ddbs and cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab zhu et al 2017 experiments with surfactant stabilized emulsions and pure surfactant solutions indicate that emulsified oil rather than free surfactants is responsible for the increase in the tmp uf crossflow filtration tests revealed that emulsions stabilized by ctab quickly fouled the negatively charged polysulfone uf membrane due to electrostatic attraction between surfactant stabilized oil droplets and the membrane in contrast membrane fouling was less severe in experiments with ddbs and triton stabilized emulsions in nf filtration tests fouling increased exponentially regardless of the type of surfactant used to stabilize the emulsion zhu et al 2017 for both uf and nf processes fouling experiments and theoretical calculations indicated that cake layer formation underlies the initial membrane fouling by emulsified oil however depending on the type of emulsion and membrane once the pressure drop across the cake layer reached a critical value oil droplets can wet the membrane surface and lead to irreversible membrane fouling in a different study he et al conducted a set of constant permeate flux fouling experiments with pvdf mf membranes using multiple feed solutions namely latex bead suspension soybean motor and crude oil in water emulsions he et al 2016 the fouling tests were performed under the same hydrodynamic conditions and with the same membrane where the fouling propensity only depended on membrane foulant and foulant foulant interactions the tmp profiles for motor and crude oil in water emulsions which fouled more severely exhibited slow tmp increase in the early stage followed by an abrupt increase due to inhomogeneous fouling and then the tmp eventually reached a pseudo steady state with cake filtration as the operative fouling mechanism the results also revealed that foulants with higher zeta potential have lower fouling propensity subsequently the same group investigated the impact of permeate flux on membrane fouling he et al 2017b constant permeate flux tests with soybean and crude oil in water emulsions and pvdf mf membranes showed that above the threshold flux tmp profile develops over three distinct stages initial gradual tmp increase followed by a tmp jump and then a pseudo steady state tmp which corresponds to the critical pressure of the oil layer he et al 2016 membrane fouling is inherently a complex phenomenon and the fouling by oil droplets further augments the complexity due to unique phenomena such as coalescence tummons et al 2016 moving cake layer tanudjaja et al 2017 thinner but denser cake tanudjaja and wei chew 2019 viscous effects tanudjaja and chew 2019 better predictability by the dlvo derjaguin lewis verwey overbeek rather than xdlvo i e extended dlvo model he et al 2017a tanudjaja and chew 2018 effect of different surfactants tanis kanbur et al 2018 and internal membrane pore fouling despite the oil droplets being larger than the membrane pore trinh et al 2018 while membrane fouling studies are abundant in the literature the understanding on oil foulants remain comparatively limited more studies on mechanistically understanding membrane fouling by oil is needed particularly in view of the recent studies that have collectively shown oil to be distinctive from other particulate foulants 3 2 mitigating membrane fouling by oil an overview of methods this section introduces three main approaches to membrane fouling control and describes case studies to illustrate how each approach is applied in the context of oil water separation 3 2 1 materials science approach making membranes resistant to fouling an effective approach to reduce membrane fouling by oil is to increase the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface maguire boyle and barron 2011 maximous et al 2009 wang et al 2016 water adsorption onto a hydrophilic surface restricts its interactions with oil and limits fouling with the hydration layer serving as an entropic barrier for oil attachment maguire boyle and barron 2011 wang et al 2016 numerous techniques have been used to increase the hydrophilicity of membranes by either blending common membrane polymers with hydrophilic additives e g hydrophilic polymers amphiphilic copolymers and inorganic nanoparticles or altering the membrane surface properties via chemical or physical post modification e g surface coating and surface graft polymerization wang et al 2016 the incorporation of polyethylene glycol polymer chains alone or among copolymer blends is a common method for increasing surface hydrophilicity chakrabarty et al investigated the performance of four types of polysulfone ps uf membranes in the process of separating synthetic emulsions of crude oil in water under crossflow conditions chakrabarty et al 2008 2010 ps membranes were fabricated using different casting mixtures of n methyl pyrrolidone nmp polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and poly ethylene glycol which led to different membrane morphologies the four membranes successfully rejected 90 of the oil and the oil concentration in the permeate was below 10 mg l which met discharge requirements in another study chen et al modified the hydrophilicity of an ultrafiltration membrane by blending amphiphilic copolymers pluronic f127 with poly ether sulfone pes to separate oil water emulsions pes pluronic f127 membranes exhibited higher permeate flux and better antifouling property compared to the bare pes membrane chen et al 2009 while addition of hydrophilic polymers improves the fouling resistance of membranes the introduction of hydrophilic polymers can lead to defects in the membrane resulting in a breakdown of the membrane under high tmp ochoa et al 2003 the modification of commercial membranes to become more hydrophilic for anti fouling characteristics to enhance oily wastewater treatment has been enabled by osmonic filtration solution inc and clean water pte ltd which offer hydrophilized polyacrylonitrile pan as the membrane material under different brand names section 2 1 the usage of nanomaterials to improve membrane performance has also emerged in recent years zhan et al used a halloysite nantotubes hnts intercalated graphene oxide go coating on a porous poly arylene ether nitrile nanofibrous support layer which was further enhanced with another layer of mussel inspired polydopamine pda coating zhan et al 2018 this combination gave superior performance of more than 99 oil rejection and high permeate flux of 1130 56 l m2h for the gravity driven filtration of a feed containing oil emulsion because the nanotubes provided more water channels for permeation and the hydrophilic pda increased water flux and also rejected oil more effectively nano sized polydopamine nanocluster coating was also employed by wang et al on a electrospun nanofibrous enf membrane constructed from the cross linking of polyacrylonitrile and hyperbranched polyethyleneimine pan hpei wang et al 2018 the resulting membrane gave a high permeate flux of 1600 l m2h and oil rejection of 98 5 also for gravity driven filtration li et al surface modified a commercial ptfe membrane by using a polydopamine layer infused with nano microsphere and hydrophilic carboxyl groups in a tetrahydrofuran thf tris buffer mixture li et al 2018b the membrane exhibited rejection of up to 99 and permeate flux of around 2000 l m2h for feeds containing various oils and surfactants another new trend for oil water separation is the surface modification of an inorganic mesh rather than polymer or ceramic membrane hou et al had nano sized nickel particle coating on a stainless steel mesh which was made by using electrodeposition in deep eutectic solvent des composed by choline chloride chcl ethylene glycol eg to separate oil and water hou et al 2018 such modified meshes expressed superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity characteristics which made the oil water separation excellent for various oils such as silicon oil corn oil and crude oil for feeds containing oil emulsion the modified mesh was altered further by more electrodeposition to reduce the pore size of the mesh from 14 μm to 4 μm improve the rejection of the micron sized oil droplets the permeate flux of this gravity driven process was around 300 l m2h but rejection was poor another study had a stainless steel mesh coated with copper via electrodeposition to make a hydrophilic membrane which was modified further by applying dodeconethiol to make the membrane became superhydrophobic li et al 2018a both membranes were used concurrently in the filtration setup such that water permeated through the superhydrophilic membrane and oil permeated through the superhydrophobic membrane giving high permeate flux and separation efficiency greater than 99 8 though the reported performances are excellent for such modified membranes the practicality for commercial implementation has to be critically assessed firstly the longer term durability of such coatings particularly in the presence of cross flow in practical operations most of these membranes and meshes were tested using gravity driven filtration which is not congruent with the presence of a continuous tangential shear on the membrane surface that may wash away the coatings with time the hydrodynamic stability on top of thermal and chemical stability of such membranes needs to be addressed secondly quite a number of such studies focused on treating feeds with free oil i e droplets larger than 150 μm which is more effectively separated by other means like hydrocyclones cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 thirdly the uniformity of such modification across larger membranes has to be assessed particularly because membrane fouling is a self accelerating process 3 2 2 hydrodynamics based approach controlling mass transfer of oil to the membrane surface in membrane modules the hydrodynamics in the membrane filtration system is one of the most important factors that can be controlled to reduce membrane fouling the velocity field in the membrane module can be described by the reynolds number r e an aggregate characteristic of the flow domain at higher r e the higher shear near the membrane surfaces compresses the mass transfer boundary layer and helps minimize deposition of foulants promoting turbulence in membrane flow channels has been accomplished by a number of means including vibration genkin et al 2006 bubbling cui and wright 1996 ultrasound kobayashi et al 1999 and spacers 2015 inserting a static mixer into the flow channel of the tubular membrane gaspar et al 2015 is one approach that can be effective in minimizing fouling by emulsified oil the effect of different designs of static mixers was studied by computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations and experiments a zro2 ceramic membrane with an inner diameter of 6 8 mm and a nominal pore size of 50 nm was challenged by the oily wastewater feed consisted of 5 wt of a cutting lubricant oil additive the cfd results showed that the spiral ribbon design for the static mixer was the optimal design for the membrane process since the velocity increase caused by the static mixer caused the least increase of pressure drop inside the membrane channel which agree with experimental results that indicated the positive impact on the permeate flux higher retention of oil and also decreased fouling another study with a static mixer was carried out involved crossflow uf of cutting oil emulsion 5 w w at a constant temperature of 50 c krstić et al 2007 the zirconia membrane had a pore size of 20 nm and the results showed that the presence of the static mixer as a turbulence promoter inside the membrane increased the permeate flux by up to 6 times at the highest tmp a schematic of the static mixer and its coupling with the membrane cell is shown in fig 4 the static mixer increased the shear rate at the membrane surface along with turbulence secondary flow and instability effects which led to significant flux enhancement the static mixer was also used in another study for treating produced water from the daqing oilfield china with 12 52 84 42 mg l of oil zhen et al 2006 four different kinds of static mixer positioned inside an uf 100 kda pvdf tubular membrane which gave an increase of flux in the range of 83 164 as well as a decrease of dissipated power per unit volume of permeate of around 31 42 the flux enhancement also increased with the increase of tmp and crossflow velocity turbulence promoters can also be in the form of a high shear rotary device used in a uf unit like the one studied by viadero and coworkers to treat a synthetic oily wastewater of metal working fluids viadero et al 2000 this system was operated by placing a static membrane in the membrane channel that was connected to a rotating shaft which enhanced the hydraulic turbulence on the membrane surface and thereby minimized the buildup of concentration polarization cp and membrane fouling the feed solution entered via the opening near the static membrane and the permeate was drawn out in the direction of the rotating shaft in another study mao et al 2018 a self cleaning piezo electric membrane made by modifying the porous lead zirconia titanate pzt membrane enabled the promotion of turbulence on the membrane surface by the generation of an ultrasound wave using an alternating voltage this membrane was hydrophilic and oleophobic which further enhanced the removal of the oil fouling layer the system was challenged with a soybean oil emulsion with 200 500 mg l of oil and the results showed that higher permeate flux was achieved but the effectiveness of the ultrasound wave decreased as the operating tmp increased the turbulence promoters mitigate membrane fouling and reduce the mass transfer resistance at the boundary layer thereby increasing the permeate flux some limitations need to be resolved for the static mixer usage is limited to tubular ceramic membranes which in turn limits the application to uf and mf since such membranes are not available in the pore size ranges corresponding to nf and ro the size of the static mixer could be shrunk to a smaller size amenable for use with hollow fiber membranes which are more common and have more versatile applications nanoimprinting of patterned membranes are novel embodiments of static mixers maruf et al 2013 xie et al 2017 regarding the high shear rotary device the current drawback is similarly the limitation to flat disk membranes but innovative designs for amenability to other membrane types are possible particularly with 3d printing armbruster et al 2018 trade offs are inevitable in the optimization of membrane processes increasing the shear stress gives better membrane fouling mitigation on one hand but may affect the membrane integrity on the other hand and thereby reduce rejection 3 2 3 damage control approach devising effective methods of membrane cleaning different cleaning procedures have been proposed and employed in practice to remove foulants from the membrane surface and or from within membrane pores based on the nature of the cleaning methods they can be classified as hydraulic chemical and mechanical hydraulic cleaning methods rely on water flushes water back flushes and periodic tmp relaxation mulder and mulder 2010 one of the studies employed hydraulic cleaning methods back flushing and cross flushing to clean uf and nf membranes fouled by hexadecane in water emulsions stabilized by triton x 100 ctab and ddbs zhu et al 2017 the results showed that hydraulic cleaning can be used to recover membrane flux when operating below a critical pressure drop across the cake layer however once the membrane is wetted by oil hydraulic cleaning is not effective at restoring the permeate flux hydraulically irreversible fouling calls for the application of a more aggressive cleaning strategy such as chemical cleaning the chemicals include aqueous solutions at extreme ph alkaline or acidic depending on the predominant foulant and oxidizing compounds e g hypochlorite koh et al 2010 mansouri et al 2010 aggressive chemical cleaning gradually degrades membrane materials accelerates membrane aging and shortens membrane s lifespan mansouri et al 2010 another study employed two chemical cleaning techniques to remove oil adsorbed onto a pvdf uf membrane hu et al 2003 namely i washing with a micellar solution consisting of a surfactant sds and an alcohol in water pentan 1 ol and ii immersion of the fouled membrane in a hclnacl gasoline aqueous solution both could restore the properties of the membranes to 97 of the initial permeability zhang et al evaluated cleaning strategies for removing crude oil from a polyamide nf membrane using flux measurements salt rejection experiments atomic force microscopy afm contact angle measurements and atr ftir the results indicated that optimal cleaning consisted of two stages cleaning with an alkaline ph 11 solution of 0 05 edta 0 2 sodium pyrophosphate and 0 2 sds for 0 5 h followed by an hcl solution ph of 2 for 0 5 h the cleaning approach recovered permeate flux without damaging the membrane zhang et al 2016 mechanical cleaning methods include air flushing ultrasound vibrational cleaning and sponge ball cleaning mueller et al 1997 juang and lin used a horn ultrasonicator to recover permeate flux of a uf membrane used to filter water in oil emulsions juang and lin 2004 experiments explored the effects of sonicator tip position ultrasonic power and solution properties such as percentage of emulsification and volumetric ratio of emulsions to the external aqueous phase the results demonstrated that the membrane lifespan could be prolonged with careful control of the ultrasonic intensity such as below about 80 w cm2 due to the trade off between the higher fouling mitigation efficiency and the higher degradation of organics associated with a higher power one of the commercial membrane modules which include both chemical and hydraulic cleaning via the cleaning in place cip method is ceramem from veolia water tech loganathan et al 2015 chemical cleaning is done using a combination of caustic soda citric acid and sodium hypochlorite while hydraulic cleaning by backwash another chemical cleaning bench scale study was done at the qatari lng plant by suez water technologies solutions usa a sequence of cleaning by hypochlorite and then followed by citric acid was found to be adequate to recover the flux in membrane bioreactors adham et al 2018 due to the deformability of oil droplets and the propensity to form a contiguous film cleaning the membrane fouled with oil is more difficult than that fouled with rigid particulates hydraulic cleaning is effective for external fouling i e fouling on the membrane surface but not irreversible fouling on the other hand chemical cleaning is more effective due to its capability to remove irreversible fouling as well past studies indicate that cleaning whether physical or chemical cannot recover the membrane performance totally so effective membrane fouling mitigation is essential to prolong filtration and delay cleaning as much as possible 3 3 quantifying the extent of membrane fouling 3 3 1 permeate

m t t m p δ p d t t m p δ π m t t m p 1 3 3 2 selectivity the selectivity of the membrane is important in conferring the rejection needed to ensure the purity of the retentate and or permeate in the membrane filtration of oily water the selectivity of the membrane can be represented by the percentage rejection r which is quantified by factoring the difference of oil concentrations at the feed c f and the permeate c p sides luo et al 2015 vasanth et al 2013 6 r c f c p c f 100 a trade off inevitably exists between permeability and selectivity on the one hand larger pore sizes give higher permeability but lower selectivity on the other hand smaller pore sizes give lower permeability but higher selectivity to this end researchers have continuously striven to push the limits of both permeability and selectivity simultaneously as fouling progresses oil rejection or selectivity deteriorates padaki et al 2015 oil unlike other rigid colloidal foulants can deform and penetrate through the membrane pores and thereby reduces the permeate quality darvishzadeh et al 2013 penetration of the oil occurs only if the tmp is high enough to overcome the critical pressure which is based on the young laplace equation and developed to describe the penetration of the oil droplet or oil film into the pores darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 in the presence of the typical cross flow implemented to mitigate fouling the permeation of the oil is not only dependent on tmp alone but also on the force balance between permeation and drag force from the cross flow shear darvishzadeh et al subsequently extended the simulation study to incorporate this shear effect for an oil droplet pinned on the pore entrance darvishzadeh et al 2013 and considered many parameters that can affect the permeation of the oil droplet such as droplet to pore size ratio surface tension and viscosity ratio experimentally one study found that increasing the cross flow velocity cfv decreased then increased oil rejection zhou et al 2018 this is because the cross flow has the twin effects of enhancing permeation due to the higher pressure and also enhancing coalescence to form a secondary membrane that resists permeation in another experimental study as the tmp increased the flux increase accelerated pore blockage and thereby decreased oil rejection chang et al 2014 clearly the trade off between permeability and selectivity has to be considered with particular consideration of the deformation and coalescence of the oil droplets 3 4 evaluating the fouling potential of the feed solution several indices have been devised to quantify the fouling propensity of the membrane feed the indices can be obtained in simple tests by following standard testing procedures and can help with the choice of the suitable membrane type 3 4 1 silt density index sdi the silt density index sdi is a common method used to quantify the fouling propensity of feed water the test procedure involves measuring the time needed for 500 ml of the feed solution to pass through a 0 45 μm microfiltration membrane at 30 psi 207 kpa yiantsios and karabelas 2003 after 15 min of interval while the filtration was kept going on the second measurement of time required to filter the same volume is done conventionally the measurement is taken over a interval period of 15 min but when the solution has high fouling properties the 15 min time interval can be shortened to 10 5 or 3 min sdi can be calculated using the following equation 7 sdi 100 t 1 t i t f where t is the total filtration duration t i is the initial time of the first filtration of 500 ml of the sample and t f is the final time to filter 500 ml of sample after a 15 min interval sdi is not a sensitive fouling index since it is a static measurement of resistance at preset time intervals i e only based on initial and final measurements and does not measure the rate of change of resistance during the filtration test in addition it only measures the fouling rate associated with particles larger than 0 45 μm although ro fouling can be caused by particles much smaller than 0 45 μm wei et al 2012 the standard blocking method of fouling was found to be the more dominant fouling mechanism during the sdi measurement but was not in a good agreement with the base assumption of the sdi measurement of total rejection of the colloidal particles the question regarding of the applicability of sdi also revolved around the fact that fouling is affected by many factors which include both membrane and colloidal characteristics ghaffour et al 2013 found that the variability of the sdi values between two mf membrane with similar mean pore sizes of 0 45 μm was due to differences in membrane thickness and pore size distribution the thinner membrane gave a higher permeate flux which brought more particles to the membrane and increased the fouling extent and thus the sdi value a similar result was reported by alhadidi et al regarding the effect of membrane properties on the sdi value alhadidi et al 2011 in their study eight different membranes with similar mean pore sizes were employed to study the variance of the sdi values they proved that the sdi value was affected by factors that affect membrane resistance like pore size and shape bulk and surface porosity thickness morphology surface roughness and also zeta potential these results suggest that sdi is not the best parameter for characterizing the potential of fouling from the feed water but it is still one of the most popular means due to its simplicity other fouling indices such as modified fouling index mfi and combined fouling index cfi have been proposed as more accurate fouling metrics than sdi 3 4 2 modified fouling index mfi and combined fouling index cfi the modified fouling index mfi is a dynamic index that takes into account the evolution of the cake resistance during the filtration test mfi is determined using the same equipment 0 45 μm microfiltration membrane as the sdi but the volume is recorded every 30 s over a 15 min filtration period schippers and verdouw 1980 this fouling index is based on the concept of cake filtration where the thickness of the cake layer formed at the membrane surface is directly proportional to the filtered volume the mfi value can be determined from the gradient of the general cake filtration equation for constant pressure in a t v versus v plot mulder and mulder 2010 8 t v μ r m δ p a μ α c f 2 δ p a 2 v equation 8 can be rewritten as 9 1 q α m f i v where v is the filtrate volume t is the filtration time and α is the specific resistance of the deposited cake the assumption implicit in the mfi approach is that cake filtration is the only fouling mechanism mulder and mulder 2010 however other mechanisms often contribute to permeate flux decline e g pore blocking by smaller particles thus both sdi and mfi are deficient in that they do not account for fouling mechanisms occurring when smaller particles are present in the feed therefore sdi and mfi underestimate the extent of fouling that would be observed in practice with uf nf and ro membranes unlike sdi and mfi the combined fouling index cfi estimates the potential ro nf fouling due to various fouling mechanisms by combining mfi values obtained from individual mfi tests choi et al used three different membranes hydrophilic mf hydrophobic mf and hydrophilic uf to measure mfi choi et al 2009 and calculated cfi by assuming a linear combination of the three mfi values 10 cfi ω 1 m 1 ω 2 m 2 ω 3 m 3 where m 1 m 2 and m 3 are the mfi values of the three membranes the weighing factors ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are calculated based on the flux decline rate φ of each membrane which is defined as choi et al 2009 11 φ 1 j o 2 d j d t t 0 where j o is the initial permeate flux and t is the filtration time 3 4 3 applicability of sdi mfi and cfi to quantifying membrane fouling by oil water emulsions the fouling indices sdi mfi and cfi described above are measured using dead end filtration but most practical oil water membrane separations are performed in a crossflow mode thus these fouling indices do not account for the possibility of back transport due to crossflow yet hydrodynamic conditions can have a profound impact on membrane fouling for example membrane fouling by emulsified oil can be mitigated by oil coalescence tummons et al 2016 wherein oil droplets coalesce to reach a critical size and then are swept off the membrane surface by the crossflow shear another concern is the applicability of the same fouling indicator to a variety of oil water emulsion feed solutions as described in section 1 1 1 oily industrial wastewater can vary in composition depending on its source for instance produced water may have much higher salinity than oily wastewater produced by food industries in addition oil content and droplet size can impact permeate flux decline as increasing oil concentration in the feed can lead to a greater decline in flux the deformation of the oil droplet allows it to penetrate into the membrane pore and such is undetected by these methods the other limitation is that mfi and cfi tests use a microfiltration membrane and it is questionable to what extent this membrane can predict the performance of different membranes 4 understanding membrane fouling by oily wastewater measurement approaches and techniques significant research efforts have been directed at understanding membrane fouling and development of effective fouling mitigation strategies the suite of technologies reviewed in this section includes non invasive and in situ approaches to assess membrane fouling these will be categorized as online and offline measurements 4 1 online measurements real time and non invasive fouling measurement is needed to monitor practical membrane processes in order to provide for early warning on membrane fouling 4 1 1 electrical impedance spectroscopy eis eis was initially used to estimate the thickness of membrane cell fricke and morse 1925 and the application of the method was subsequently extended to membrane filtration processes antony et al 2013 bannwarth et al 2015 cen et al 2015 gao et al 2013b ho et al 2016a 2016b 2017 hu et al 2014 roldan cruz et al 2016a 2016b shahidi et al 2017 sim et al 2013a 2016 yeo et al 2014 eis uses alternate current at a range of frequencies the measured values of current voltage and frequency are translated to capacitance and conductance values and plotted versus frequency in a nyquist plot in this plot the y axis is the inverse of capacitance which is known as negative imaginary impedance axis zimg and the x axis is the inverse of conductance which is known as real impedance zreal the number of effective layers and the electrical properties of the system can thereby be interpreted the schematic of the eis cell is shown in fig 5 eis has been used to study membrane fouling mostly in ro and fo tests where different types of fouling have been observed such as colloidal fouling biofouling and scaling in most of these studies eis was more sensitive to changes in the filtration process e g rising tmp or declining salt rejection compared to the conventional methods sim et al 2013a studied the effect of silica bsa and the mixture of both on fouling whereas feeds containing silica shifted the nyquist plot leftwards due to the build up of the silica layer and due to cake enhanced osmotic pressure ceop feeds containing bsa shifted the nyquist plot rightwards due to the build up of a dense but thin fouling layer for the feed containing both silica and bsa the shift of the nyquist plot depended on the ratio of the foulants eis is a versatile technology with applications not only limited to the study of membrane fouling two studies roldan cruz et al 2016b shahidi et al 2017 used eis to assess the stability of oil in water o w emulsion while roldan cruz et al used eis to monitor the complexation between biopolymers in the bulk solution roldan cruz et al 2016a this indicates that eis can potentially be applied to the study of membrane fouling by oil emulsions 4 1 2 ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr first used in the construction and materials engineering application and in weld inspection to locate and size hidden cracks the utdr method has been used also in the study of membrane fouling the utdr is a non invasive and non destructive measurement technique which uses ultrasonic waves to measure and locate interfaces moving or stationary therefore useful for the detection of the membrane fouling specifically the thickness of the foulant layer in the utdr a transducer emits ultrasonic waves through the top of the membrane module cell and the waves are reflected when in contact with an interface the time taken t for the waves to return to the detector can be used to distinguish different layers in the membrane module this time t is plotted against amplitude which provides a means of monitoring the evolution of membrane fouling the utdr is a versatile technique that can be used to study different types of membrane filtration including microfiltration li et al 2002 sanderson et al 2002 silalahi et al 2009 xu et al 2009a nanofiltration nf li et al 2007 zhang et al 2006b reverse osmosis ro an et al 2011 mairal et al 1999 2000 sanderson et al 2002 sim et al 2013b and also different membrane types including both flat sheet and hollow fiber hf membranes xu et al 2009a the schematic of a utdr system is shown in fig 6 utdr was employed to study the formation of scaling or inorganic fouling by calcium sulfate at different axial velocities in a ro desalination process mairal et al 1999 utdr showed significantly greater sensitivity to fouling detection in comparison to traditional fouling monitoring methods such as those that rely on measuring flux decline or transmembrane pressure tmp for membrane based oil water separation the utdr has also been used to investigate fouling by feed mimicking produced water in crossflow microfiltration with both flat sheet silalahi et al 2009 and hollow fiber xu et al 2009b membranes whereby 2d and 3d visualization for the fouling was enabled both studies consistently found that the fouling progression by the oil was oil adsorption on the membrane surface before the compaction by oil 4 2 offline measurement offline measurements have also been used for studying the membrane fouling phenomena either a scaled down version of the process is studied or the membrane is taken offline for measurement of pore size or membrane autopsy after the operation is shut down 4 2 1 direct observation through membrane dotm and other microscopy based techniques the direct observation through the membrane dotm technique li et al 1998 2000 2003 neal et al 2003 tanis kanbur et al 2018 tanudjaja and chew 2018 tanudjaja et al 2016 2017 2018 tummons et al 2016 2017 wicaksana et al 2012 zamani et al 2016 2017c zhang et al 2006a 2010 and other microscopic techniques such as direct microscopic observation dmo subramani et al 2009 or direct visual observation dvo culfaz et al 2011 mores and davis 2001 are based on the usage of light microscopy to directly observe the membrane surface firstly introduced by li et al 1998 as a novel way to study particle deposition on the membrane the dotm uses transparent membranes to enable the visualization of the feed membrane interface fig 7 in the other microscopic techniques non transparent membranes can be studied of different types e g hollow fiber chang and fane 2000 culfaz et al 2011 materials e g cellulose acetate mores and davis 2001 and pore sizes e g nf membranes subramani et al 2009 the dotm studies were largely correlated with critical flux field et al 1995 which is the permeate flux value below which fouling is negligible regarding oil emulsions dotm was used by tummons et al 2016 2017 to study the behavior of deposited oil droplets on the membrane surface dotm tests with hexadecane in water emulsion stabilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate sds revealed three characteristic stages of membrane fouling by emulsified oil 1 droplet attachment and clustering 2 droplet deformation and 3 droplet coalescence visualization by dotm was complemented with a force balance analysis on an oil droplet pinned on a single pore at the membrane surface the results indicate that membrane fouling by emulsified oil could be mitigated by droplet coalescence and crossflow shear another effort was carried out by tanudjaja et al to investigate the effect of oil concentration salt concentration and crossflow velocity on critical flux which also observed that the fouling layer by oil emulsion was a moving cake layer tanudjaja et al 2017 they further linked the fouling observations via dotm to the interaction energy between the membrane and oil emulsion it was concluded that the derjaguin lewis verwey overbeek dlvo rather than the more commonly used extended dlvo xdlvo model correlated better the differences in fouling by various oils tanudjaja and chew 2018 which agrees with an earlier study he et al 2017a another study on oil emulsion stabilized by various surfactants gave interesting striping phenomena tanudjaja et al 2018 while another used molecular dynamics simulations to explain the coalescence behavior by some oils tanis kanbur et al 2018 4 2 2 evapoporometry ep the evapoporometry ep is a novel technique initially proposed to measure the pore size distribution of membranes with key advantages of allowing measurement at ambient conditions akhondi et al 2015 krantz et al 2013 which thereby allows for membrane autopsy akhondi et al 2017 to understand the extent of internal fouling ep is based on the measurement of the evaporation rate of the volatile wetting liquid from the pores then applying the kelvin equation to quantify the pore size distribution as schematically depicted in fig 8 recent enhancements to the ep technique include the extension of the measurable pore size range by a judicious choice of the surface tension and vapor pressure of the wetting volatile liquid zamani et al 2017b and extending the applicability to hollow fiber membranes whose active layers are on the lumen side zamani et al 2017a 4 2 3 optical coherence tomography oct optical coherence tomography oct was used initially in the medical field and now commonly in membrane based filtration processes oct is based on light interference generated by a near infrared light beam which is split into two channels with one going to the reference mirror and the other to the membrane cell in the membrane cell the light is back scattered from different media and recombined again with the light from reference mirror which results in an interference spectrum detected by the spectrometer the schematic of the oct is presented in fig 9 by using fourier transform interferogram the depth information can be known a scan and the collection of these a scans is known as b scan which gives the plane view of the membrane gao and coworkers used oct to characterize the velocity profile normal to the membrane surface when different orientations of spacers i e 0 45 and 90 to the crossflow were used gao et al 2013a another study utilized oct to image biofilms in nf and ro systems and found that the biofilm was more compact when the permeate flux increased dreszer et al 2014 this indicates that membrane performance deterioration was not only related to biofilm thickness but also the internal biofilm structure the oct was also used to study colloidal fouling silica and bentonite li et al 2016 and internal fouling by oil emulsions trinh et al 2018 4 3 implementation of techniques to monitor membrane fouling online and the practical challenges the electrical impedance spectroscopy eis and ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr technology can be implemented on line in practical membrane processes both of these techniques were used in a side stream canary cell chong et al 2007a b 2008 whereby a part of the feed stream is channeled to a designated monitoring cell which has the same hydrodynamics and material as the main membrane process for the utdr system one study sim et al 2013b simulated the canary cell at the laboratory scale for monitoring biofouling in a ro system by dosing silica to enhance the signal due to the low acoustic signal given by biofouling which has similar acoustic properties as water the system was further developed sim et al 2015 as shown schematically in fig 10 the canary cell had the same hydrodynamics and material as the swm module and shown to be representative of the swm with respect to accuracy and reproducibility in the detection of fouling the same concept and design of a canary cell was also used in a trial field study in a water treatment plant newater in singapore ho et al 2017 whereby eis was used for monitoring and giving advance warning of fouling in the canary cell that mimics the swm operated in parallel the schematic for the canary cell which was termed as eisfm electrical impedance spectroscopy fouling monitor canary cell is shown in fig 11 the feed used here was secondary treated municipal wastewater after treatment by mf in the canary cell the membranes spacers hydrodynamics and flux used were the same as that in the ro module during the eight months of operation the results showed four peaks in the graph of zreal dp versus operation time which appeared earlier than the scheduled cleaning in place cip protocol this indicates that the eisfm canary cell can be used to detect fouling earlier than conventional methods for the eis and utdr to be used in detecting fouling by oil emulsions more understanding on this unique foulant is warranted in view of the possibility for practical implementation of the utdr and eis using the canary cell system it is potentially feasible to incorporate other advanced monitoring techniques such as dotm and oct particularly since both dotm and oct have been proven to be capable of monitoring membrane fouling by oil tanudjaja and chew 2018 2019 tanudjaja et al 2018 tanudjaja et al 2017 tanudjaja and wei chew 2019 trinh et al 2018 tummons et al 2017 tummons et al 2016 to use the same canary cell some limitations of dotm and oct have to be overcome namely the need for transparent membranes for dotm and the cumbersome data analysis for oct transparent membranes are not realistic for the conventional polymeric ones but possibly instead of focusing through the membranes the focal plane could be on the membrane surface the precision would be lower than that necessary for the mechanistic understanding sought in lab experiments but acceptable for the goal of detecting the onset of fouling in commercial applications as for the large volumes of data generated by oct advancement in computing prowess mitigates this issue and also the analyses can possibly be much simplified with the development of correlations based on mechanistic understandings from lab experiments furthermore in view of the limited optical area monitored by dotm and oct the collection of data from multiple optical spots can be implemented 5 conclusion the abundant oily wastewater would harm the environment if discharged without proper treatment in view of the urgent need to treat the vast volumes of oily wastewater and the promises of membrane technology playing an important role a comprehensive review on the practical aspects of membrane based filtration for oil water separation was carried out the present review focuses on practical aspects of applying membrane technology to treatment of oily wastewater the sources and composition of oily wastewater are appraised depending on the source the composition of oily wastewater can vary broadly complicating the selection of an appropriate treatment technology yet environmental regulations mandate a certain degree of treatment before the water can be discharging into the environment commercially available membrane technologies used to separate oil and water has been used increasingly in the last few years with ceramic tubular membranes and flat sheet polymeric membranes being most popular membrane technology complements rather than replaces the conventional methods for treating oily wastewater to achieve a higher quality product sustainably the integration of membrane based and other methods harnesses the advantages and also circumvents the shortcomings of each the cost of membrane based treatment of oily wastewater is quite varied but is generally lower than conventional technologies the challenges associated with membrane filtration of oily wastewater are centered on membrane fouling a key obstacle that hinders broader implementation of membrane technology for oil water separation oil droplets which can both deform and coalesce are unique foulants that challenge the available knowhow on fouling more studies on mechanistically understanding membrane fouling by oil is needed particularly in view of the recent studies that have collectively shown oil to be distinctive from other particulate foulants approaches to mitigating membrane fouling include fouling resistant membranes turbulence promoters and membrane cleaning for the novel membranes on top on proving superiority in performance practical issues such as longer term durability of the coats in the presence of cross flow treatment of realistic feeds and uniformity of modification across large membrane areas have to be addressed too with respect to turbulence promoters increasing the shear stress gives better membrane fouling mitigation on one hand but may affect the membrane integrity on the other hand and thereby reduce rejection as for membrane cleaning the deformability of oil droplets and the propensity to form a contiguous film makes total recovery more difficult so effective membrane fouling mitigation is essential to prolong filtration and delay cleaning as much as possible online and offline methods to study membrane fouling have been gaining more attention lately online means allow for real time monitoring of practical membrane processes in order to provide for early warning of membrane fouling in contrast offline methods allow for a more in depth mechanistic understanding of membrane fouling the discussion of the monitoring methods is concluded by a perspective on the potential of coupling state of the art techniques to facilitate better monitoring and

18887,the large volumes of oily wastewater generated by various industries such as oil and gas food and beverage and metal processing need to be de oiled prior to being discharged into the environment compared to conventional technologies such as dissolved air flotation daf coagulation or solvent extraction membrane filtration can treat oily wastewater of a much broader compositional range and still ensure high oil removals in the present review various aspects related to the practical implementation of membranes for the treatment of oily wastewater are summarized first sources and composition of oily wastewater regulations that stipulate the extent of treatment needed before discharge and the conventional technologies that enable such treatment are appraised second commercially available membranes membrane modules operation modes and hybrids are overviewed and their economics are discussed third challenges associated with membrane filtration are examined along with means to quantify and mitigate membrane fouling finally perspectives on state of the art techniques to facilitate better monitoring and control of such systems are briefly discussed keywords membrane fouling oil water separation oil emulsion fouling mitigation on line monitoring membrane modification 1 introduction oil water mixtures are found in many industrial processes and can take the form of a product a by product or a waste stream whether the goal is for recovering the oil for economic gains or removing the oil phase for environmentally friendly disposal the separation of the oil and other immiscible components is necessary environmental regulations governing the discharge of oily wastewater have become increasingly stricter with country specific regulatory limits on the maximum oil concentration of generally within the 5 40 mg l range daud et al 2015 the oil phase in wastewater can exist in three forms classified based on the size of the oil droplets cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 namely free oil 150 μm dispersed oil 20 150 μm and emulsified oil 20 μm the choice and performance of oil water separation techniques depend not only on oil droplet size but also on other considerations such as oil concentration and chemical composition membrane filtration is a promising technology for separating oil droplets smaller than 10 μm padaki et al 2015 notably the increasing interest in the employment of membrane filtration for the treatment of oily wastewater is evident in the significant increase in the number of publications over the last three decades 1988 2018 vis à vis more conventional methods as depicted in fig 1 correspondingly a review of the advances to date on this topic is warranted unfortunately membrane fouling is a major drawback that reduces productivity and increases operational costs of membrane filtration many efforts have been dedicated to understanding the mechanisms of membrane fouling and to develop methods to effectively monitor and mitigate membrane fouling the focus of the review is on the practical aspects of applying pressure driven membranes to the treatment of oily wastewaters highlighting the requirements recent development drawbacks and corresponding mitigation strategies in the first section of this paper we review the common sources and properties of oily wastewater the discharge regulations as well as technologies that have been used to treat oily wastewater in the subsequent section the advantages of using membranes for the treatment of oily wastewater commercially will be reviewed along with the related challenges and counter measures in the final section we review the state of the art technologies of monitoring and mitigating membrane fouling and discuss the potential of membranes for the treatment of oily wastewater 1 1 oily wastewater sources quantities and composition oily wastewater is a by product generated by many industries including oil and gas food and beverage shipping and maritime tanning textile and metal and machining cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 mueller et al 1997 oily wastewater not only adversely affects the environment if not adequately treated but also represents a substantial economic loss if the oil is not recovered oil water separation has received renewed interest with the recent developments in the fossil fuel sector particularly for the treatment of produced water which is oily wastewater stream from the oil and gas extraction operations cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 daud et al 2015 produced water is generated from onshore as well as offshore wells the global produced water generated is approximated at 250 million barrels day for every 80 million barrels day of oil produced with 800 million m3 of produced water were discharged from offshore facilities throughout the world in 2003 alone fakhru l razi et al 2009 neff et al 2011 the treatment of the enormous volume of produced water is important from both an environmental perspective to reduce water consumption and minimize waste disposal and also from an economic perspective as expenses on water management can account for 5 15 of drilling costs fakhru l razi et al 2009 neff et al 2011 other than oil complex constituents in produced water include many type of chemicals such as linear chain hydrocarbons aromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene and xylene metals naturally occurring radioactive material norm and additive chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors and emulsion destabilizers cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 mueller et al 1997 neff et al 2011 the composition of produced water as well as its physical and chemical properties are generally site specific neff et al 2011 in the food drink and milk industry water is a significant component in most products mavrov and bélières 2000 and also is involved in many steps and processes such as washing rinsing mixing pasteurizing etc casani et al 2005 because the amount of oily wastewater produced is also large the implementation of means for reuse is cost effective due the economies of scale vourch et al 2008 most of the oil waste comes from meat poultry seafood and dairy thus the wastewater typically has a very high content of organic carbon another major producer of oily wastewater is the metal processing industry where cutting oil is used as a coolant and flushing fluid cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 seo et al 2007 cutting oils are emulsions consisting of oil water and additives such as fatty acids surfactants heavy metals and biocides perez et al 2007 the oil content in such waste streams is too low for it to be incinerated yet they are too toxic to be treated biologically in summary oily wastewater from various industries tends to be of very complex and varied compositions which complicates the selection of an appropriate treatment technology and calls for context specific treatment solutions 1 2 regulations for discharging oily wastewater the direct discharge of oily wastewater into the environment without proper treatment can have grave consequences including the disruption of the aqueous ecosystem pollution of the groundwater or drinking water resources and endangering human health yu et al 2017 region specific regulations have been introduced to enforce the treatment of oily wastewater prior to its discharge to the environment in the north sea region oslo paris ospar convention regulates that the upper limit for the discharge of oil content in the wastewater is 30 mg l dickhout et al 2017 according to the paris convention the upper limit of oil content to be discharged to the sea is 40 mg l for the offshore fields and 5 mg l for the on land fields holdich et al 1998 in the u s the environmental protection agency epa stipulates a maximum oil content of 72 mg l for any 24 h period and 45 mg l over a 30 days period chen et al 1991 other studies reported on regulations with similar limits of oil concentration that can be released into the open water e g maximum oil content of 40 mg l typical range around 10 15 mg l mueller et al 1997 vasanth et al 2013 in norway the limit on the oil concentration allowed to be discharged into the sea from an offshore installation to the norwegian continental shelf was reduced from 40 to 30 mg l as of 2007 which implies the increased stringency in the quality of the discharge in china the upper limit for oil concentration in the discharged wastewater is 10 mg l yu et al 2017 these regulations compel an urgent need for developing technologies that can reach these treatment goals cost efficiently the common technologies for treating oily waste water are discussed in the next section 1 3 oily wastewater treatment conventional technologies an overview of the common technologies used in treating oily wastewater is provided in table 1 along with the oil concentration ranges in the feed and the removal effectiveness an et al 2017 daud et al 2015 fakhru l razi et al 2009 each method has its own challenges in treating oily wastewater 2 membrane technology for oil water separation membrane based separation is the most cost effective solution for removing oil droplets smaller than 10 μm frankiewicz 2001 the amount of oil in the emulsified fraction can be significant making the removal of these droplets a prerequisite for meeting environmental regulations separation methods based on the oil water density differential e g settling flotation hydrocyclone require an exceedingly long retention time for the removal of emulsified oil while chemical treatment e g fentone process coagulation may not effectively de stabilize oil in water emulsions particularly when the emulsified oil is finely dispersed kajitvichyanukul et al 2011 compared to the conventional methods membrane filtration offers several advantages that include higher quality permeate lower space footprint more straightforward automation no need for extraneous chemicals and therefore reduced waste and lower energy input mondal and wickramasinghe 2008 mueller et al 1997 szep and kohlheb 2010 yang et al 2015 these advantages coupled with the ability of membranes to reject other pollutants present in the feed make membranes competitive with the more traditional technologies as with all membrane filtration processes the key drawback that limits the broader implementation of membrane based oil water separations is membrane fouling cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 which is the cumulative deposition of the feed constituents like oil on the surface of the membrane and inside the pores that results in a decline in the permeate flux and quality other limitations of membrane technology include lower throughput e g much lower than that of hydrocyclones and relatively higher capital costs given that membrane based separation is most effective for the oil droplet size range of 1 10 μm ultrafiltration uf and tighter microfiltration mf are the more relevant choices bilstad and espedal 1996 however if the wastewater is saline and desalination is an accompanying treatment goal employing reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf can allow for a single step processing of such waste streams cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 membrane distillation md also shows promise gryta and karakulski 1999 han et al 2017 tan et al 2017 velioğlu et al 2018 in this section commercially available membranes are discussed followed by membrane modules then batch and continuous modes the last two sub sections focus on hybrid or integrated membrane processes and the economics of the membrane process 2 1 commercially available membranes for oily industrial wastewater the membrane based processing of oily wastewaters sometimes combined with conventional methods has been successfully implemented in more than 3000 polymeric uf mf installations and over 75 inorganic ceramic ones worldwide since 20 years ago cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 according to a report by grand view research inc the global market for the treatment of produced water which is the major wastewater in the oil and gas industry reached 5 81 billion in 2015 of which 46 8 was for secondary separation technologies including membrane based techniques inc 2016 several companies such as osmonics koch alcoa veolia and filtration solution inc offer commercial membranes for oil water separation table 2 presents a list of some of the membranes available on the market currently osmonics and filtration solutions inc offer spiral wound ultrafiltration membrane modules to concentrate oily wastewater streams m series ultrafilic and shp series membranes respectively incorporated 2016 lenntech 2002 both membranes are made from a chemically modified polyacrylonitrile pan and designed to protect the membrane from fouling by free oil and from degradation by solvents to minimize fouling these membranes have been engineered to be extremely hydrophilic i e water contact angle of 40 relative to the conventional polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf and polysulfone ps membranes that are hydrophobic lenntech 2002 in addition both membranes can operate at temperatures of up to 50 c and can withstand ph values in the range from 2 to 10 for continuous operation and from 3 to 9 for when cleaning in place cip is incorporated into the process typical permeate fluxes are 8 34 l m2 h for the m series ultrafilic membranes and 17 43 l m2 h for the shp series membranes incorporated 2016 lenntech 2002 numerous membrane companies offer integrated treatment systems to process oily industrial wastewater akvola technologies established a flotation filtration system akvofloat that can lower both energy consumption and footprint technologies 2017 of treatment the system consists of two stages that are integrated in the same tank the first stage is flotation whereby the suspended oil is carried to the surface by bubbles with the aid of the akvola microbubble generator which induces fine gas bubbles using low pressure air nitrogen ozone or carbon dioxide co2 the role of the microbubbles is to attach to the oil droplets and particles which are carried to the surface and then continuously skimmed off the second stage entails membrane filtration with submerged ceramic membranes d p o r e 0 2 μm positioned below the float layer technologies 2017 cdm smith is currently marketing a hybrid system to treat produced water containing up to 20 000 mg l of total dissolved solids this system combines several commercially available technologies namely microfiltration mf ion exchange uv disinfection and reverse osmosis ro the pretreatment consists of filtering the feed solution through prefiltration cartridge filter with a nominal pore size of 1 3 μm to remove particulates followed by ion exchange to remove polycations and then uv disinfection to reduce bacterial activity finally the water undergoes a multi stage ro process employing a combination of low pressure ro capable of achieving 85 recovery and seawater ro membranes 80 water recovery k guerra 2011 veolia water technologies offers a produced water system opus optimized pretreatment and unique separation technology which consists of multiple treatment processes namely chemical softening via multiflo with filtration followed by ion exchange then ro the pretreatment processes before the ro step are designed to reduce the hardness and suspended solids in the feed solution eliminating the potential for precipitative and colloidal fouling of the ro membranes loganathan et al 2015 clean water tech pte ltd provided a uf hollow fiber membrane with pore size ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 μm which was made from hydrophilized polyacrylonitrile ultra flo u630c the ph range that this membrane could tolerate was 2 12 and the maximum feed pressure and temperature possible were respectively 3 5 bar and 50 c in addition a ro composite polyamide spiral wound membrane swc3 from hydraunatics could handle feeds with ph ranged from 3 to 10 and maximum operating pressure and temperature of 83 bar and 45 c respectively miller et al 2013 these examples of commercially available membranes indicate the practical feasibility of such processes in the last two decades the focus on the treatment of oily wastewater has made available membranes that can withstand reasonable ranges of temperature pressure and ph to cater to the complexities of such feeds 2 2 membrane modules different kinds of membrane types and modules and system have been employed in oil water separation processes in the past two decades table 3 the common module designs are flat sheet spiral wound tubular capillary and hollow fiber with flat sheet and tubular being more popular flat sheet modules are commonly employed in research laboratories for bench scale experimentation the advantages include relative simplicity of module design and operation and availability of wide range of pore sizes spanning ro nf uf and mf however one of the key advantages is that the membrane area per unit module volume is low and thereby less feasible for commercial implementation because of the larger footprint necessary nonetheless flat sheet membranes form the basis for the dominant ro module namely the spiral wound membrane swm module which is a stack of flat sheet membranes with spacers between the sheets rolled and placed inside a cylindrical case such a packing method significantly enhances the availability of membrane area per unit module volume for filtration tubular membranes capillary and hollow fiber membranes differ by the lumen size inner lumen diameters greater than 0 635 cm between 0 1 and 0 635 cm and between 0 025 and 0 1 cm respectively most of the ceramic membranes which have greater mechanical strength as well as chemical and thermal stability are tubular the drawback is the limited availability of such membranes to only uf and mf one of the chief advantages of hollow fiber membranes is the greatest membrane area per unit volume vis à vis tubular and flat sheet ones which is giving this membrane type more attention in the membrane community 2 3 membrane filtration in batch or continuous operation modes membranes can be operated either in batch or continuous mode most of the separation processes in the industry are performed in the continuous mode whereby the feed stream is continuously flowed through the unit thus the feed concentration remains relatively constant in contrast for batch processing the feed stream becomes increasingly concentrated with time due to the permeation of water to the permeate side and thus increasing the fouling tendency batch processing is useful if the concentrated retentate is one of the desired product also along with the permeate in the following sub sections the reports on batch and continuous membrane based processes for oily wastewater are summarized 2 3 1 batch processing most of the reports on the use of membrane in de oiling application in the batch mode are on treating the oily wastewater from the olive oil milling process stoller and chianese optimized the uf and nf batch process for the purification of the olive washing wastewater by using the critical flux concept stoller and chianese 2006 specifically the critical flux was determined for various concentrations then employed as the basis for choosing the permeate flux value near and below the critical flux in order to delay the fouling and extend the membrane lifetime particularly as the feed got more concentrated in the batch process the reason for using the batch mode was its operability with a smaller active membrane area at a smaller scale relative to the continuous mode membrane fouling however was worse for the batch system with time the system consisted of a continuous aerobic biological reactor followed by a swm uf batch system and then the nf batch process after which the purified water was discharged to the municipal sewage system the results show that by implementing a permeate flux based on the critical flux help extend membrane lifetime and decrease fouling another study on deoiling olive mill wastewater used an integrated mf nf system followed by either osmotic distillation od or vacuum membrane distillation vmd garcia castello et al 2010 the mf system was employed in a batch concentration mode at 0 72 bar and 22 c while the nf batch system was operated at 20 c and 8 bar this integrated system was used to recover and concentrate the polyphenols from the olive mill wastewater with 78 of polyphenols recovered in the mf system and the rest recovered by the nf the vmd had a higher flux but required a higher power consumption in comparison to the od system due to the need for a vacuum pump or a refrigeration step for condensing the permeate paraskeva et al studied a batch process for treating olive mill wastewater by integrating uf nf and ro at various values of temperature and transmembrane pressure tmp paraskeva et al 2007 at the pretreatment step a ceramic ultrafilter with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm was operated at 15 35 c and 1 2 5 bar the nf ro hybrid system used polymeric membranes mwcos of 200 da and 100 da for nf and ro respectively operated at tmp values of 10 30 bar and 30 40 bar for nf and ro respectively batch processing is employed mainly to recover or retain certain desired product from the oily wastewater which means the retentate rather than the permeate is the valuable component in such cases the batch mode is preferred since the lower feed volume vis à vis continuous processing allows for better control of the retentate quality and the capital costs are lower the drawback is the lifetime of the membrane since the progressive concentration of the product in the retentate inevitably leads to extensive membrane fouling which necessitates more frequent membrane cleaning or replacement 2 3 2 continuous flow processing the continuous flow mode is more suitable for treating large amounts of oily wastewater as is the case for example in the oil and gas industry ebrahimi et al used continuous processing for treating produced water using an integration system that included mf dissolved air floatation daf as well as crossflow uf cfuf and nf systems ebrahimi et al 2010 the mf membrane was made of aluminum oxide al2o3 and had a pore size in the 0 1 0 2 μm range while the uf and nf membranes were made of titanium dioxide tio2 and had mwcos of 20 000 uf 1000 and 750 da nf respectively the process was carried out by directing the produced water continuously through the mf unit followed by a batch daf unit and finally by the continuous cfuf or nf system all the units were operated at tmp values ranging from 0 5 to 2 bar crossflow velocities of 0 6 1 3 m s and feed concentrations ranging from 32 to 5420 mg l of oil most of the oil 93 was removed by mf with rest of the process train ensuring 99 5 total removal of oil polymeric membranes such as pvdf have also been employed for the continuous processing of oily wastewater obaid et al 2017 specifically the surface morphology was modified by hydrophilic microspheres on the pvdf membrane surface turning the membrane from naturally hydrophobic to super hydrophilic the permeate flux when treating the oil emulsion was 2 700 l m2 h which was significantly higher in comparison to the pristine hydrophobic pvdf membrane and the oil rejection was up to 99 continuous processing is mostly used to treat oily wastewater from various industries prior to discharge into the environment to comply to the regulations the main focus in such cases is to purify the water as much as possible to allow for safe release into the environment with negligible impact to the ecosystem and reuse in the plant although the main target is the volume of the treated water the retained oil also has economic value the other advantage of the continuous mode is the feed flow that provides a tangential shear at the membrane surface to mitigate membrane fouling thereby prolonging the lifetime of the membrane 2 4 hybrid membrane processes oily wastewater can have a very complex composition and contain suspended and dissolved species that differ in concentration size charge and density in order to achieve a sustainable membrane based separation of oily wastewater it is often necessary to integrate the membrane unit with other membranes whether in batch or continuous processes as described previously or other conventional unit processes such integration may ease the foulant load on the membrane thereby mitigating membrane fouling and prolonging the membrane lifetime membrane fouling can be mitigated using adequate pretreatment different physical biological and chemical methods have been used for the pretreatment of oily wastewater these include gas sparging ducom et al 2002 fouladitajar et al 2016 coagulation karakulski and morawski 2002 flocculation zhong et al 2003 centrifugation karakulski and morawski 2002 electrocoagulation milic et al 2016 acidification wang et al 2016 cartridge pre filtration karakulski and morawski 2002 dissolved air flotation daf zouboulis and avranas 2000 activated carbon adsorption mohammadi and esmaeelifar 2005 as well as separation by larger pore size membranes such as uf hilal et al 2004 karakulski et al 1995 liu 2016 and mf daiminger et al 1995 karakulski and morawski employed an integrated membrane system based on uf and nf to treat waste oil water emulsion from a cable factory karakulski and morawski 2002 fig 2 uf with 100 kda mwco membranes resulted in 99 rejection of suspended solids and retention of oil and lubricants the resulting uf permeate was further purified by nf to reject the remaining pollutants and reduce the content of copper ions i e dominant constituent in the oily wastewater from the cable factory another study proposed a hybrid system that used flocculation as a pretreatment zhong et al 2003 by coupling this pretreatment with the downstream mf with a 0 2 μm pore size zirconia membrane the permeate flux was increased and permeate quality improved in comparison with mf alone one study utilized adsorption with membrane filtration for treating oily wastewater and demonstrated that the integration increased the permeate quality and reduced membrane fouling rasouli et al 2017 powdered activated carbon pac and natural zeolite were compared in terms of the effectiveness as adsorbents at the mf pretreatment stage total organic carbon toc removal was up to 99 5 and 99 9 respectively for pac and zeolite with the latter performing better due to the higher oil adsorption rate and thereby lower fouling of the mf membrane in another study on treating industrial oily wastewater with 550 mg oil l of oil and 6500 mg cod l coagulation coupled with mf was used as a pretreatment step for uf cheng and gong 2018 polyaluminum chloride was the coagulant used in combination with a ceramic 0 2 μm pore size mf membrane followed by a pvdf uf membrane unit the results demonstrated that the uf permeate flux increased 2 5 times compared to the process without pretreatment the entire integrated system achieved up to 95 2 of cod reduction and 98 5 oil removal which was much better than what could be accomplished with the standalone units or with any other couplings other types of coagulation have also been integrated with membrane units an example of which is electrocoagulation ec with ro rodrigues pires da silva et al 2015 in this study with feeds containing 1000 mg oil l ec functioned as a pretreatment step using either ac or dc current after which the effluent was left in a sedimentation tank for 5 min before going through the ro unit while ec gave 92 reduction of cod which was sufficient alone to meet the current regulations for discharge to the sea the subsequent ro unit achieved 100 removal of cod the ec unit was also used in another study with mf to treat the oily wastewater from a drilling site changmai et al 2019 as shown by fig 3 membrane technology complements rather than replaces the conventional methods for treating oily wastewater to achieve a higher quality product sustainably the integration of membrane based and other methods harnesses the advantages and also circumvents the shortcomings of each 2 5 economics of membrane based treatment of oily wastewater as mentioned earlier membrane technology is economically advantageous for oily wastewater treatment compared to the other conventional technologies based on the numbers available in literature the cost of membrane based treatment was estimated to be 1 3 m3 cheryan 1998 cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 which compares favorably with that for is 3 65 m3 cost of treatment by dissolved air floatation daf the cost inevitably depends on the source of the oily wastewater since each industry has unique blends of oil and grease as well as other foulants specific to the process for example the total cost including costs of membranes labor electricity cleaning and maintenance of treating oily wastewater from the fatty acid industry was 2 65 m3 dangel et al 1995 that from the railroad industry was 1 03 1 48 m3 while that for the metalworking wastewater using uf was 2 8 m3 cheryan 1998 in another study using mf nandi and coworkers estimated that the annual cost of the membrane based treatment for oily wastewater with an oil concentration of 50 mg l could be as little as 0 098 m3 for treating feeds at 100 m3 day nandi et al 2009 clearly the cost of membrane based treatment of oily wastewater is quite varied but is nevertheless lower than that for conventional technologies moreover more recently the cost of membrane based treatment has been slashed due to improvements in membrane fabrication and operation as a benchmark the total water treatment cost by ro desalination was around 0 5 m3 whereas that by the conventional thermal process was in the range of 0 8 1 1 m3 judd 2017 as another benchmark the total cost for treating a secondary agriculture based effluent stream was around 0 15 0 42 m3 bick et al 2012 3 the challenges of membrane operation 3 1 mechanisms of membrane fouling by oil the key obstacle that hinders the widespread implementation of membrane technology for oil water separation is membrane fouling notably the underlying mechanisms of membrane fouling by emulsified oil remains poorly understood for example the conditions under which the accumulated oil forms compressible cakes or contiguous films are unclear several studies have analyzed permeate flux decline during the filtration of oil in water emulsions and used blocking filtration laws one of the first reports was by hermia 1982 to explain the mechanisms of membrane fouling by oil abbasi et al 2011 koltuniewicz and field 1996 koltuniewicz et al 1995 mohammadi et al 2003 ohya et al 1998 salahi et al 2010 two studies abbasi et al 2011 nandi et al 2009 showed that membrane fouling by oil is due to cake formation whereby multiple layers of oil form a secondary membrane on the membrane surface other researchers linked membrane fouling by oil to intermediate pore blocking whereby the membrane is fouled by early stages of cake filtration and complete pore blocking abbasi et al 2011 koltuniewicz et al 1995 nandi et al 2009 six out of the seven aforementioned studies applied the blocking filtration laws to crossflow filtration although the hermia blocking laws hermia 1982 do not take into account the back transport of particles away from the membrane surface and only account for spherical non deformable particles oil droplets which can both deform and coalesce are unique foulants that challenge the available knowhow on fouling another study investigated the fouling of nf and uf membranes using hexadecane in water emulsions stabilized by different surfactants namely a non ionic surfactant triton x 100 anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzensulfonate ddbs and cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab zhu et al 2017 experiments with surfactant stabilized emulsions and pure surfactant solutions indicate that emulsified oil rather than free surfactants is responsible for the increase in the tmp uf crossflow filtration tests revealed that emulsions stabilized by ctab quickly fouled the negatively charged polysulfone uf membrane due to electrostatic attraction between surfactant stabilized oil droplets and the membrane in contrast membrane fouling was less severe in experiments with ddbs and triton stabilized emulsions in nf filtration tests fouling increased exponentially regardless of the type of surfactant used to stabilize the emulsion zhu et al 2017 for both uf and nf processes fouling experiments and theoretical calculations indicated that cake layer formation underlies the initial membrane fouling by emulsified oil however depending on the type of emulsion and membrane once the pressure drop across the cake layer reached a critical value oil droplets can wet the membrane surface and lead to irreversible membrane fouling in a different study he et al conducted a set of constant permeate flux fouling experiments with pvdf mf membranes using multiple feed solutions namely latex bead suspension soybean motor and crude oil in water emulsions he et al 2016 the fouling tests were performed under the same hydrodynamic conditions and with the same membrane where the fouling propensity only depended on membrane foulant and foulant foulant interactions the tmp profiles for motor and crude oil in water emulsions which fouled more severely exhibited slow tmp increase in the early stage followed by an abrupt increase due to inhomogeneous fouling and then the tmp eventually reached a pseudo steady state with cake filtration as the operative fouling mechanism the results also revealed that foulants with higher zeta potential have lower fouling propensity subsequently the same group investigated the impact of permeate flux on membrane fouling he et al 2017b constant permeate flux tests with soybean and crude oil in water emulsions and pvdf mf membranes showed that above the threshold flux tmp profile develops over three distinct stages initial gradual tmp increase followed by a tmp jump and then a pseudo steady state tmp which corresponds to the critical pressure of the oil layer he et al 2016 membrane fouling is inherently a complex phenomenon and the fouling by oil droplets further augments the complexity due to unique phenomena such as coalescence tummons et al 2016 moving cake layer tanudjaja et al 2017 thinner but denser cake tanudjaja and wei chew 2019 viscous effects tanudjaja and chew 2019 better predictability by the dlvo derjaguin lewis verwey overbeek rather than xdlvo i e extended dlvo model he et al 2017a tanudjaja and chew 2018 effect of different surfactants tanis kanbur et al 2018 and internal membrane pore fouling despite the oil droplets being larger than the membrane pore trinh et al 2018 while membrane fouling studies are abundant in the literature the understanding on oil foulants remain comparatively limited more studies on mechanistically understanding membrane fouling by oil is needed particularly in view of the recent studies that have collectively shown oil to be distinctive from other particulate foulants 3 2 mitigating membrane fouling by oil an overview of methods this section introduces three main approaches to membrane fouling control and describes case studies to illustrate how each approach is applied in the context of oil water separation 3 2 1 materials science approach making membranes resistant to fouling an effective approach to reduce membrane fouling by oil is to increase the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface maguire boyle and barron 2011 maximous et al 2009 wang et al 2016 water adsorption onto a hydrophilic surface restricts its interactions with oil and limits fouling with the hydration layer serving as an entropic barrier for oil attachment maguire boyle and barron 2011 wang et al 2016 numerous techniques have been used to increase the hydrophilicity of membranes by either blending common membrane polymers with hydrophilic additives e g hydrophilic polymers amphiphilic copolymers and inorganic nanoparticles or altering the membrane surface properties via chemical or physical post modification e g surface coating and surface graft polymerization wang et al 2016 the incorporation of polyethylene glycol polymer chains alone or among copolymer blends is a common method for increasing surface hydrophilicity chakrabarty et al investigated the performance of four types of polysulfone ps uf membranes in the process of separating synthetic emulsions of crude oil in water under crossflow conditions chakrabarty et al 2008 2010 ps membranes were fabricated using different casting mixtures of n methyl pyrrolidone nmp polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and poly ethylene glycol which led to different membrane morphologies the four membranes successfully rejected 90 of the oil and the oil concentration in the permeate was below 10 mg l which met discharge requirements in another study chen et al modified the hydrophilicity of an ultrafiltration membrane by blending amphiphilic copolymers pluronic f127 with poly ether sulfone pes to separate oil water emulsions pes pluronic f127 membranes exhibited higher permeate flux and better antifouling property compared to the bare pes membrane chen et al 2009 while addition of hydrophilic polymers improves the fouling resistance of membranes the introduction of hydrophilic polymers can lead to defects in the membrane resulting in a breakdown of the membrane under high tmp ochoa et al 2003 the modification of commercial membranes to become more hydrophilic for anti fouling characteristics to enhance oily wastewater treatment has been enabled by osmonic filtration solution inc and clean water pte ltd which offer hydrophilized polyacrylonitrile pan as the membrane material under different brand names section 2 1 the usage of nanomaterials to improve membrane performance has also emerged in recent years zhan et al used a halloysite nantotubes hnts intercalated graphene oxide go coating on a porous poly arylene ether nitrile nanofibrous support layer which was further enhanced with another layer of mussel inspired polydopamine pda coating zhan et al 2018 this combination gave superior performance of more than 99 oil rejection and high permeate flux of 1130 56 l m2h for the gravity driven filtration of a feed containing oil emulsion because the nanotubes provided more water channels for permeation and the hydrophilic pda increased water flux and also rejected oil more effectively nano sized polydopamine nanocluster coating was also employed by wang et al on a electrospun nanofibrous enf membrane constructed from the cross linking of polyacrylonitrile and hyperbranched polyethyleneimine pan hpei wang et al 2018 the resulting membrane gave a high permeate flux of 1600 l m2h and oil rejection of 98 5 also for gravity driven filtration li et al surface modified a commercial ptfe membrane by using a polydopamine layer infused with nano microsphere and hydrophilic carboxyl groups in a tetrahydrofuran thf tris buffer mixture li et al 2018b the membrane exhibited rejection of up to 99 and permeate flux of around 2000 l m2h for feeds containing various oils and surfactants another new trend for oil water separation is the surface modification of an inorganic mesh rather than polymer or ceramic membrane hou et al had nano sized nickel particle coating on a stainless steel mesh which was made by using electrodeposition in deep eutectic solvent des composed by choline chloride chcl ethylene glycol eg to separate oil and water hou et al 2018 such modified meshes expressed superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity characteristics which made the oil water separation excellent for various oils such as silicon oil corn oil and crude oil for feeds containing oil emulsion the modified mesh was altered further by more electrodeposition to reduce the pore size of the mesh from 14 μm to 4 μm improve the rejection of the micron sized oil droplets the permeate flux of this gravity driven process was around 300 l m2h but rejection was poor another study had a stainless steel mesh coated with copper via electrodeposition to make a hydrophilic membrane which was modified further by applying dodeconethiol to make the membrane became superhydrophobic li et al 2018a both membranes were used concurrently in the filtration setup such that water permeated through the superhydrophilic membrane and oil permeated through the superhydrophobic membrane giving high permeate flux and separation efficiency greater than 99 8 though the reported performances are excellent for such modified membranes the practicality for commercial implementation has to be critically assessed firstly the longer term durability of such coatings particularly in the presence of cross flow in practical operations most of these membranes and meshes were tested using gravity driven filtration which is not congruent with the presence of a continuous tangential shear on the membrane surface that may wash away the coatings with time the hydrodynamic stability on top of thermal and chemical stability of such membranes needs to be addressed secondly quite a number of such studies focused on treating feeds with free oil i e droplets larger than 150 μm which is more effectively separated by other means like hydrocyclones cheryan and rajagopalan 1998 thirdly the uniformity of such modification across larger membranes has to be assessed particularly because membrane fouling is a self accelerating process 3 2 2 hydrodynamics based approach controlling mass transfer of oil to the membrane surface in membrane modules the hydrodynamics in the membrane filtration system is one of the most important factors that can be controlled to reduce membrane fouling the velocity field in the membrane module can be described by the reynolds number r e an aggregate characteristic of the flow domain at higher r e the higher shear near the membrane surfaces compresses the mass transfer boundary layer and helps minimize deposition of foulants promoting turbulence in membrane flow channels has been accomplished by a number of means including vibration genkin et al 2006 bubbling cui and wright 1996 ultrasound kobayashi et al 1999 and spacers 2015 inserting a static mixer into the flow channel of the tubular membrane gaspar et al 2015 is one approach that can be effective in minimizing fouling by emulsified oil the effect of different designs of static mixers was studied by computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations and experiments a zro2 ceramic membrane with an inner diameter of 6 8 mm and a nominal pore size of 50 nm was challenged by the oily wastewater feed consisted of 5 wt of a cutting lubricant oil additive the cfd results showed that the spiral ribbon design for the static mixer was the optimal design for the membrane process since the velocity increase caused by the static mixer caused the least increase of pressure drop inside the membrane channel which agree with experimental results that indicated the positive impact on the permeate flux higher retention of oil and also decreased fouling another study with a static mixer was carried out involved crossflow uf of cutting oil emulsion 5 w w at a constant temperature of 50 c krstić et al 2007 the zirconia membrane had a pore size of 20 nm and the results showed that the presence of the static mixer as a turbulence promoter inside the membrane increased the permeate flux by up to 6 times at the highest tmp a schematic of the static mixer and its coupling with the membrane cell is shown in fig 4 the static mixer increased the shear rate at the membrane surface along with turbulence secondary flow and instability effects which led to significant flux enhancement the static mixer was also used in another study for treating produced water from the daqing oilfield china with 12 52 84 42 mg l of oil zhen et al 2006 four different kinds of static mixer positioned inside an uf 100 kda pvdf tubular membrane which gave an increase of flux in the range of 83 164 as well as a decrease of dissipated power per unit volume of permeate of around 31 42 the flux enhancement also increased with the increase of tmp and crossflow velocity turbulence promoters can also be in the form of a high shear rotary device used in a uf unit like the one studied by viadero and coworkers to treat a synthetic oily wastewater of metal working fluids viadero et al 2000 this system was operated by placing a static membrane in the membrane channel that was connected to a rotating shaft which enhanced the hydraulic turbulence on the membrane surface and thereby minimized the buildup of concentration polarization cp and membrane fouling the feed solution entered via the opening near the static membrane and the permeate was drawn out in the direction of the rotating shaft in another study mao et al 2018 a self cleaning piezo electric membrane made by modifying the porous lead zirconia titanate pzt membrane enabled the promotion of turbulence on the membrane surface by the generation of an ultrasound wave using an alternating voltage this membrane was hydrophilic and oleophobic which further enhanced the removal of the oil fouling layer the system was challenged with a soybean oil emulsion with 200 500 mg l of oil and the results showed that higher permeate flux was achieved but the effectiveness of the ultrasound wave decreased as the operating tmp increased the turbulence promoters mitigate membrane fouling and reduce the mass transfer resistance at the boundary layer thereby increasing the permeate flux some limitations need to be resolved for the static mixer usage is limited to tubular ceramic membranes which in turn limits the application to uf and mf since such membranes are not available in the pore size ranges corresponding to nf and ro the size of the static mixer could be shrunk to a smaller size amenable for use with hollow fiber membranes which are more common and have more versatile applications nanoimprinting of patterned membranes are novel embodiments of static mixers maruf et al 2013 xie et al 2017 regarding the high shear rotary device the current drawback is similarly the limitation to flat disk membranes but innovative designs for amenability to other membrane types are possible particularly with 3d printing armbruster et al 2018 trade offs are inevitable in the optimization of membrane processes increasing the shear stress gives better membrane fouling mitigation on one hand but may affect the membrane integrity on the other hand and thereby reduce rejection 3 2 3 damage control approach devising effective methods of membrane cleaning different cleaning procedures have been proposed and employed in practice to remove foulants from the membrane surface and or from within membrane pores based on the nature of the cleaning methods they can be classified as hydraulic chemical and mechanical hydraulic cleaning methods rely on water flushes water back flushes and periodic tmp relaxation mulder and mulder 2010 one of the studies employed hydraulic cleaning methods back flushing and cross flushing to clean uf and nf membranes fouled by hexadecane in water emulsions stabilized by triton x 100 ctab and ddbs zhu et al 2017 the results showed that hydraulic cleaning can be used to recover membrane flux when operating below a critical pressure drop across the cake layer however once the membrane is wetted by oil hydraulic cleaning is not effective at restoring the permeate flux hydraulically irreversible fouling calls for the application of a more aggressive cleaning strategy such as chemical cleaning the chemicals include aqueous solutions at extreme ph alkaline or acidic depending on the predominant foulant and oxidizing compounds e g hypochlorite koh et al 2010 mansouri et al 2010 aggressive chemical cleaning gradually degrades membrane materials accelerates membrane aging and shortens membrane s lifespan mansouri et al 2010 another study employed two chemical cleaning techniques to remove oil adsorbed onto a pvdf uf membrane hu et al 2003 namely i washing with a micellar solution consisting of a surfactant sds and an alcohol in water pentan 1 ol and ii immersion of the fouled membrane in a hclnacl gasoline aqueous solution both could restore the properties of the membranes to 97 of the initial permeability zhang et al evaluated cleaning strategies for removing crude oil from a polyamide nf membrane using flux measurements salt rejection experiments atomic force microscopy afm contact angle measurements and atr ftir the results indicated that optimal cleaning consisted of two stages cleaning with an alkaline ph 11 solution of 0 05 edta 0 2 sodium pyrophosphate and 0 2 sds for 0 5 h followed by an hcl solution ph of 2 for 0 5 h the cleaning approach recovered permeate flux without damaging the membrane zhang et al 2016 mechanical cleaning methods include air flushing ultrasound vibrational cleaning and sponge ball cleaning mueller et al 1997 juang and lin used a horn ultrasonicator to recover permeate flux of a uf membrane used to filter water in oil emulsions juang and lin 2004 experiments explored the effects of sonicator tip position ultrasonic power and solution properties such as percentage of emulsification and volumetric ratio of emulsions to the external aqueous phase the results demonstrated that the membrane lifespan could be prolonged with careful control of the ultrasonic intensity such as below about 80 w cm2 due to the trade off between the higher fouling mitigation efficiency and the higher degradation of organics associated with a higher power one of the commercial membrane modules which include both chemical and hydraulic cleaning via the cleaning in place cip method is ceramem from veolia water tech loganathan et al 2015 chemical cleaning is done using a combination of caustic soda citric acid and sodium hypochlorite while hydraulic cleaning by backwash another chemical cleaning bench scale study was done at the qatari lng plant by suez water technologies solutions usa a sequence of cleaning by hypochlorite and then followed by citric acid was found to be adequate to recover the flux in membrane bioreactors adham et al 2018 due to the deformability of oil droplets and the propensity to form a contiguous film cleaning the membrane fouled with oil is more difficult than that fouled with rigid particulates hydraulic cleaning is effective for external fouling i e fouling on the membrane surface but not irreversible fouling on the other hand chemical cleaning is more effective due to its capability to remove irreversible fouling as well past studies indicate that cleaning whether physical or chemical cannot recover the membrane performance totally so effective membrane fouling mitigation is essential to prolong filtration and delay cleaning as much as possible 3 3 quantifying the extent of membrane fouling 3 3 1 permeate flux membrane separation is characterized in terms of permeate flux and selectivity when the feed is ultrapure water the hydraulic resistance of the membrane r m m 1 can be obtained using darcy s equation mulder and mulder 2010 1 j 0 t m p μ r m where j 0 is volumetric permeate flux membrane m3 m2 s t m p is the transmembrane pressure differential pa and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the permeating solution pa s when the feed contains components other than water eq 1 needs to be modified to include the osmotic pressure differential across the membrane δ π pa and added resistance to the permeate flux due to fouling r f m 1 2 j t m p σ δ π μ r m r f where σ is the reflection coefficient for the permeate flux to occur in the direction from the feed to the permeate side of the membrane the pressure exerted across the membrane needs to be larger than the osmotic pressure the osmotic pressure can be calculated using van t hoff s equation 3 3 δ π i r t c m c p where i is the van t hoff s factor unitless r is the ideal gas constant j mol k t is the temperature of the solution k c m mol l is the concentration of solute in the immediate vicinity of the membrane surface and c p mol l is the solute concentration in the permeate rejected solutes form a mass transfer boundary layer adjacent to the feed face of the membrane this effect known as concentration polarization

j k the mass transfer coefficient k is given by a ratio of the diffusion coefficient of the solute m2 s to the thickness of the boundary layer m the latter can be predicted based on the sherwood correlations available for membrane channels of several geometries e g flat slit tubular hollow fibers commonly employed in membrane systems rautenbach and albrecht 1989 eq 2 can be recast as the energy balance equation e g wang and tarabara 2007 to illustrate the individual contributions of osmotic pressure and hydraulic resistance of the deposited oil layer to the permeate flux decline 5 δ p m t t m p δ p d t t m p δ π m t t m p 1 3 3 2 selectivity the selectivity of the membrane is important in conferring the rejection needed to ensure the purity of the retentate and or permeate in the membrane filtration of oily water the selectivity of the membrane can be represented by the percentage rejection r which is quantified by factoring the difference of oil concentrations at the feed c f and the permeate c p sides luo et al 2015 vasanth et al 2013 6 r c f c p c f 100 a trade off inevitably exists between permeability and selectivity on the one hand larger pore sizes give higher permeability but lower selectivity on the other hand smaller pore sizes give lower permeability but higher selectivity to this end researchers have continuously striven to push the limits of both permeability and selectivity simultaneously as fouling progresses oil rejection or selectivity deteriorates padaki et al 2015 oil unlike other rigid colloidal foulants can deform and penetrate through the membrane pores and thereby reduces the permeate quality darvishzadeh et al 2013 penetration of the oil occurs only if the tmp is high enough to overcome the critical pressure which is based on the young laplace equation and developed to describe the penetration of the oil droplet or oil film into the pores darvishzadeh and priezjev 2012 in the presence of the typical cross flow implemented to mitigate fouling the permeation of the oil is not only dependent on tmp alone but also on the force balance between permeation and drag force from the cross flow shear darvishzadeh et al subsequently extended the simulation study to incorporate this shear effect for an oil droplet pinned on the pore entrance darvishzadeh et al 2013 and considered many parameters that can affect the permeation of the oil droplet such as droplet to pore size ratio surface tension and viscosity ratio experimentally one study found that increasing the cross flow velocity cfv decreased then increased oil rejection zhou et al 2018 this is because the cross flow has the twin effects of enhancing permeation due to the higher pressure and also enhancing coalescence to form a secondary membrane that resists permeation in another experimental study as the tmp increased the flux increase accelerated pore blockage and thereby decreased oil rejection chang et al 2014 clearly the trade off between permeability and selectivity has to be considered with particular consideration of the deformation and coalescence of the oil droplets 3 4 evaluating the fouling potential of the feed solution several indices have been devised to quantify the fouling propensity of the membrane feed the indices can be obtained in simple tests by following standard testing procedures and can help with the choice of the suitable membrane type 3 4 1 silt density index sdi the silt density index sdi is a common method used to quantify the fouling propensity of feed water the test procedure involves measuring the time needed for 500 ml of the feed solution to pass through a 0 45 μm microfiltration membrane at 30 psi 207 kpa yiantsios and karabelas 2003 after 15 min of interval while the filtration was kept going on the second measurement of time required to filter the same volume is done conventionally the measurement is taken over a interval period of 15 min but when the solution has high fouling properties the 15 min time interval can be shortened to 10 5 or 3 min sdi can be calculated using the following equation 7 sdi 100 t 1 t i t f where t is the total filtration duration t i is the initial time of the first filtration of 500 ml of the sample and t f is the final time to filter 500 ml of sample after a 15 min interval sdi is not a sensitive fouling index since it is a static measurement of resistance at preset time intervals i e only based on initial and final measurements and does not measure the rate of change of resistance during the filtration test in addition it only measures the fouling rate associated with particles larger than 0 45 μm although ro fouling can be caused by particles much smaller than 0 45 μm wei et al 2012 the standard blocking method of fouling was found to be the more dominant fouling mechanism during the sdi measurement but was not in a good agreement with the base assumption of the sdi measurement of total rejection of the colloidal particles the question regarding of the applicability of sdi also revolved around the fact that fouling is affected by many factors which include both membrane and colloidal characteristics ghaffour et al 2013 found that the variability of the sdi values between two mf membrane with similar mean pore sizes of 0 45 μm was due to differences in membrane thickness and pore size distribution the thinner membrane gave a higher permeate flux which brought more particles to the membrane and increased the fouling extent and thus the sdi value a similar result was reported by alhadidi et al regarding the effect of membrane properties on the sdi value alhadidi et al 2011 in their study eight different membranes with similar mean pore sizes were employed to study the variance of the sdi values they proved that the sdi value was affected by factors that affect membrane resistance like pore size and shape bulk and surface porosity thickness morphology surface roughness and also zeta potential these results suggest that sdi is not the best parameter for characterizing the potential of fouling from the feed water but it is still one of the most popular means due to its simplicity other fouling indices such as modified fouling index mfi and combined fouling index cfi have been proposed as more accurate fouling metrics than sdi 3 4 2 modified fouling index mfi and combined fouling index cfi the modified fouling index mfi is a dynamic index that takes into account the evolution of the cake resistance during the filtration test mfi is determined using the same equipment 0 45 μm microfiltration membrane as the sdi but the volume is recorded every 30 s over a 15 min filtration period schippers and verdouw 1980 this fouling index is based on the concept of cake filtration where the thickness of the cake layer formed at the membrane surface is directly proportional to the filtered volume the mfi value can be determined from the gradient of the general cake filtration equation for constant pressure in a t v versus v plot mulder and mulder 2010 8 t v μ r m δ p a μ α c f 2 δ p a 2 v equation 8 can be rewritten as 9 1 q α m f i v where v is the filtrate volume t is the filtration time and α is the specific resistance of the deposited cake the assumption implicit in the mfi approach is that cake filtration is the only fouling mechanism mulder and mulder 2010 however other mechanisms often contribute to permeate flux decline e g pore blocking by smaller particles thus both sdi and mfi are deficient in that they do not account for fouling mechanisms occurring when smaller particles are present in the feed therefore sdi and mfi underestimate the extent of fouling that would be observed in practice with uf nf and ro membranes unlike sdi and mfi the combined fouling index cfi estimates the potential ro nf fouling due to various fouling mechanisms by combining mfi values obtained from individual mfi tests choi et al used three different membranes hydrophilic mf hydrophobic mf and hydrophilic uf to measure mfi choi et al 2009 and calculated cfi by assuming a linear combination of the three mfi values 10 cfi ω 1 m 1 ω 2 m 2 ω 3 m 3 where m 1 m 2 and m 3 are the mfi values of the three membranes the weighing factors ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are calculated based on the flux decline rate φ of each membrane which is defined as choi et al 2009 11 φ 1 j o 2 d j d t t 0 where j o is the initial permeate flux and t is the filtration time 3 4 3 applicability of sdi mfi and cfi to quantifying membrane fouling by oil water emulsions the fouling indices sdi mfi and cfi described above are measured using dead end filtration but most practical oil water membrane separations are performed in a crossflow mode thus these fouling indices do not account for the possibility of back transport due to crossflow yet hydrodynamic conditions can have a profound impact on membrane fouling for example membrane fouling by emulsified oil can be mitigated by oil coalescence tummons et al 2016 wherein oil droplets coalesce to reach a critical size and then are swept off the membrane surface by the crossflow shear another concern is the applicability of the same fouling indicator to a variety of oil water emulsion feed solutions as described in section 1 1 1 oily industrial wastewater can vary in composition depending on its source for instance produced water may have much higher salinity than oily wastewater produced by food industries in addition oil content and droplet size can impact permeate flux decline as increasing oil concentration in the feed can lead to a greater decline in flux the deformation of the oil droplet allows it to penetrate into the membrane pore and such is undetected by these methods the other limitation is that mfi and cfi tests use a microfiltration membrane and it is questionable to what extent this membrane can predict the performance of different membranes 4 understanding membrane fouling by oily wastewater measurement approaches and techniques significant research efforts have been directed at understanding membrane fouling and development of effective fouling mitigation strategies the suite of technologies reviewed in this section includes non invasive and in situ approaches to assess membrane fouling these will be categorized as online and offline measurements 4 1 online measurements real time and non invasive fouling measurement is needed to monitor practical membrane processes in order to provide for early warning on membrane fouling 4 1 1 electrical impedance spectroscopy eis eis was initially used to estimate the thickness of membrane cell fricke and morse 1925 and the application of the method was subsequently extended to membrane filtration processes antony et al 2013 bannwarth et al 2015 cen et al 2015 gao et al 2013b ho et al 2016a 2016b 2017 hu et al 2014 roldan cruz et al 2016a 2016b shahidi et al 2017 sim et al 2013a 2016 yeo et al 2014 eis uses alternate current at a range of frequencies the measured values of current voltage and frequency are translated to capacitance and conductance values and plotted versus frequency in a nyquist plot in this plot the y axis is the inverse of capacitance which is known as negative imaginary impedance axis zimg and the x axis is the inverse of conductance which is known as real impedance zreal the number of effective layers and the electrical properties of the system can thereby be interpreted the schematic of the eis cell is shown in fig 5 eis has been used to study membrane fouling mostly in ro and fo tests where different types of fouling have been observed such as colloidal fouling biofouling and scaling in most of these studies eis was more sensitive to changes in the filtration process e g rising tmp or declining salt rejection compared to the conventional methods sim et al 2013a studied the effect of silica bsa and the mixture of both on fouling whereas feeds containing silica shifted the nyquist plot leftwards due to the build up of the silica layer and due to cake enhanced osmotic pressure ceop feeds containing bsa shifted the nyquist plot rightwards due to the build up of a dense but thin fouling layer for the feed containing both silica and bsa the shift of the nyquist plot depended on the ratio of the foulants eis is a versatile technology with applications not only limited to the study of membrane fouling two studies roldan cruz et al 2016b shahidi et al 2017 used eis to assess the stability of oil in water o w emulsion while roldan cruz et al used eis to monitor the complexation between biopolymers in the bulk solution roldan cruz et al 2016a this indicates that eis can potentially be applied to the study of membrane fouling by oil emulsions 4 1 2 ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr first used in the construction and materials engineering application and in weld inspection to locate and size hidden cracks the utdr method has been used also in the study of membrane fouling the utdr is a non invasive and non destructive measurement technique which uses ultrasonic waves to measure and locate interfaces moving or stationary therefore useful for the detection of the membrane fouling specifically the thickness of the foulant layer in the utdr a transducer emits ultrasonic waves through the top of the membrane module cell and the waves are reflected when in contact with an interface the time taken t for the waves to return to the detector can be used to distinguish different layers in the membrane module this time t is plotted against amplitude which provides a means of monitoring the evolution of membrane fouling the utdr is a versatile technique that can be used to study different types of membrane filtration including microfiltration li et al 2002 sanderson et al 2002 silalahi et al 2009 xu et al 2009a nanofiltration nf li et al 2007 zhang et al 2006b reverse osmosis ro an et al 2011 mairal et al 1999 2000 sanderson et al 2002 sim et al 2013b and also different membrane types including both flat sheet and hollow fiber hf membranes xu et al 2009a the schematic of a utdr system is shown in fig 6 utdr was employed to study the formation of scaling or inorganic fouling by calcium sulfate at different axial velocities in a ro desalination process mairal et al 1999 utdr showed significantly greater sensitivity to fouling detection in comparison to traditional fouling monitoring methods such as those that rely on measuring flux decline or transmembrane pressure tmp for membrane based oil water separation the utdr has also been used to investigate fouling by feed mimicking produced water in crossflow microfiltration with both flat sheet silalahi et al 2009 and hollow fiber xu et al 2009b membranes whereby 2d and 3d visualization for the fouling was enabled both studies consistently found that the fouling progression by the oil was oil adsorption on the membrane surface before the compaction by oil 4 2 offline measurement offline measurements have also been used for studying the membrane fouling phenomena either a scaled down version of the process is studied or the membrane is taken offline for measurement of pore size or membrane autopsy after the operation is shut down 4 2 1 direct observation through membrane dotm and other microscopy based techniques the direct observation through the membrane dotm technique li et al 1998 2000 2003 neal et al 2003 tanis kanbur et al 2018 tanudjaja and chew 2018 tanudjaja et al 2016 2017 2018 tummons et al 2016 2017 wicaksana et al 2012 zamani et al 2016 2017c zhang et al 2006a 2010 and other microscopic techniques such as direct microscopic observation dmo subramani et al 2009 or direct visual observation dvo culfaz et al 2011 mores and davis 2001 are based on the usage of light microscopy to directly observe the membrane surface firstly introduced by li et al 1998 as a novel way to study particle deposition on the membrane the dotm uses transparent membranes to enable the visualization of the feed membrane interface fig 7 in the other microscopic techniques non transparent membranes can be studied of different types e g hollow fiber chang and fane 2000 culfaz et al 2011 materials e g cellulose acetate mores and davis 2001 and pore sizes e g nf membranes subramani et al 2009 the dotm studies were largely correlated with critical flux field et al 1995 which is the permeate flux value below which fouling is negligible regarding oil emulsions dotm was used by tummons et al 2016 2017 to study the behavior of deposited oil droplets on the membrane surface dotm tests with hexadecane in water emulsion stabilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate sds revealed three characteristic stages of membrane fouling by emulsified oil 1 droplet attachment and clustering 2 droplet deformation and 3 droplet coalescence visualization by dotm was complemented with a force balance analysis on an oil droplet pinned on a single pore at the membrane surface the results indicate that membrane fouling by emulsified oil could be mitigated by droplet coalescence and crossflow shear another effort was carried out by tanudjaja et al to investigate the effect of oil concentration salt concentration and crossflow velocity on critical flux which also observed that the fouling layer by oil emulsion was a moving cake layer tanudjaja et al 2017 they further linked the fouling observations via dotm to the interaction energy between the membrane and oil emulsion it was concluded that the derjaguin lewis verwey overbeek dlvo rather than the more commonly used extended dlvo xdlvo model correlated better the differences in fouling by various oils tanudjaja and chew 2018 which agrees with an earlier study he et al 2017a another study on oil emulsion stabilized by various surfactants gave interesting striping phenomena tanudjaja et al 2018 while another used molecular dynamics simulations to explain the coalescence behavior by some oils tanis kanbur et al 2018 4 2 2 evapoporometry ep the evapoporometry ep is a novel technique initially proposed to measure the pore size distribution of membranes with key advantages of allowing measurement at ambient conditions akhondi et al 2015 krantz et al 2013 which thereby allows for membrane autopsy akhondi et al 2017 to understand the extent of internal fouling ep is based on the measurement of the evaporation rate of the volatile wetting liquid from the pores then applying the kelvin equation to quantify the pore size distribution as schematically depicted in fig 8 recent enhancements to the ep technique include the extension of the measurable pore size range by a judicious choice of the surface tension and vapor pressure of the wetting volatile liquid zamani et al 2017b and extending the applicability to hollow fiber membranes whose active layers are on the lumen side zamani et al 2017a 4 2 3 optical coherence tomography oct optical coherence tomography oct was used initially in the medical field and now commonly in membrane based filtration processes oct is based on light interference generated by a near infrared light beam which is split into two channels with one going to the reference mirror and the other to the membrane cell in the membrane cell the light is back scattered from different media and recombined again with the light from reference mirror which results in an interference spectrum detected by the spectrometer the schematic of the oct is presented in fig 9 by using fourier transform interferogram the depth information can be known a scan and the collection of these a scans is known as b scan which gives the plane view of the membrane gao and coworkers used oct to characterize the velocity profile normal to the membrane surface when different orientations of spacers i e 0 45 and 90 to the crossflow were used gao et al 2013a another study utilized oct to image biofilms in nf and ro systems and found that the biofilm was more compact when the permeate flux increased dreszer et al 2014 this indicates that membrane performance deterioration was not only related to biofilm thickness but also the internal biofilm structure the oct was also used to study colloidal fouling silica and bentonite li et al 2016 and internal fouling by oil emulsions trinh et al 2018 4 3 implementation of techniques to monitor membrane fouling online and the practical challenges the electrical impedance spectroscopy eis and ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr technology can be implemented on line in practical membrane processes both of these techniques were used in a side stream canary cell chong et al 2007a b 2008 whereby a part of the feed stream is channeled to a designated monitoring cell which has the same hydrodynamics and material as the main membrane process for the utdr system one study sim et al 2013b simulated the canary cell at the laboratory scale for monitoring biofouling in a ro system by dosing silica to enhance the signal due to the low acoustic signal given by biofouling which has similar acoustic properties as water the system was further developed sim et al 2015 as shown schematically in fig 10 the canary cell had the same hydrodynamics and material as the swm module and shown to be representative of the swm with respect to accuracy and reproducibility in the detection of fouling the same concept and design of a canary cell was also used in a trial field study in a water treatment plant newater in singapore ho et al 2017 whereby eis was used for monitoring and giving advance warning of fouling in the canary cell that mimics the swm operated in parallel the schematic for the canary cell which was termed as eisfm electrical impedance spectroscopy fouling monitor canary cell is shown in fig 11 the feed used here was secondary treated municipal wastewater after treatment by mf in the canary cell the membranes spacers hydrodynamics and flux used were the same as that in the ro module during the eight months of operation the results showed four peaks in the graph of zreal dp versus operation time which appeared earlier than the scheduled cleaning in place cip protocol this indicates that the eisfm canary cell can be used to detect fouling earlier than conventional methods for the eis and utdr to be used in detecting fouling by oil emulsions more understanding on this unique foulant is warranted in view of the possibility for practical implementation of the utdr and eis using the canary cell system it is potentially feasible to incorporate other advanced monitoring techniques such as dotm and oct particularly since both dotm and oct have been proven to be capable of monitoring membrane fouling by oil tanudjaja and chew 2018 2019 tanudjaja et al 2018 tanudjaja et al 2017 tanudjaja and wei chew 2019 trinh et al 2018 tummons et al 2017 tummons et al 2016 to use the same canary cell some limitations of dotm and oct have to be overcome namely the need for transparent membranes for dotm and the cumbersome data analysis for oct transparent membranes are not realistic for the conventional polymeric ones but possibly instead of focusing through the membranes the focal plane could be on the membrane surface the precision would be lower than that necessary for the mechanistic understanding sought in lab experiments but acceptable for the goal of detecting the onset of fouling in commercial applications as for the large volumes of data generated by oct advancement in computing prowess mitigates this issue and also the analyses can possibly be much simplified with the development of correlations based on mechanistic understandings from lab experiments furthermore in view of the limited optical area monitored by dotm and oct the collection of data from multiple optical spots can be implemented 5 conclusion the abundant oily wastewater would harm the environment if discharged without proper treatment in view of the urgent need to treat the vast volumes of oily wastewater and the promises of membrane technology playing an important role a comprehensive review on the practical aspects of membrane based filtration for oil water separation was carried out the present review focuses on practical aspects of applying membrane technology to treatment of oily wastewater the sources and composition of oily wastewater are appraised depending on the source the composition of oily wastewater can vary broadly complicating the selection of an appropriate treatment technology yet environmental regulations mandate a certain degree of treatment before the water can be discharging into the environment commercially available membrane technologies used to separate oil and water has been used increasingly in the last few years with ceramic tubular membranes and flat sheet polymeric membranes being most popular membrane technology complements rather than replaces the conventional methods for treating oily wastewater to achieve a higher quality product sustainably the integration of membrane based and other methods harnesses the advantages and also circumvents the shortcomings of each the cost of membrane based treatment of oily wastewater is quite varied but is generally lower than conventional technologies the challenges associated with membrane filtration of oily wastewater are centered on membrane fouling a key obstacle that hinders broader implementation of membrane technology for oil water separation oil droplets which can both deform and coalesce are unique foulants that challenge the available knowhow on fouling more studies on mechanistically understanding membrane fouling by oil is needed particularly in view of the recent studies that have collectively shown oil to be distinctive from other particulate foulants approaches to mitigating membrane fouling include fouling resistant membranes turbulence promoters and membrane cleaning for the novel membranes on top on proving superiority in performance practical issues such as longer term durability of the coats in the presence of cross flow treatment of realistic feeds and uniformity of modification across large membrane areas have to be addressed too with respect to turbulence promoters increasing the shear stress gives better membrane fouling mitigation on one hand but may affect the membrane integrity on the other hand and thereby reduce rejection as for membrane cleaning the deformability of oil droplets and the propensity to form a contiguous film makes total recovery more difficult so effective membrane fouling mitigation is essential to prolong filtration and delay cleaning as much as possible online and offline methods to study membrane fouling have been gaining more attention lately online means allow for real time monitoring of practical membrane processes in order to provide for early warning of membrane fouling in contrast offline methods allow for a more in depth mechanistic understanding of membrane fouling the discussion of the monitoring methods is concluded by a perspective on the potential of coupling state of the art techniques to facilitate better monitoring and

18888,very recently several studies have found that homogeneous reducing agents e g sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 and sodium sulfite na2so3 can activate ferrate to enhance the degradation of selected contaminants in this work it was found that heterogeneous carbon nanotube cnt could accelerate ferrate fe vi for the degradation of bromophenols brps of environmental concerns and alleviate the appearance of undesired by products in effluent fe vi could react with brps over a wide ph range of 6 10 with apparent second order rate constants of 1 8 1850 m 1 s 1 electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry esi qqqms analysis showed that dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls and dibrominated phenoxyphenols were possibly formed via coupling reaction of brps radicals generated from fe vi oxidation through one electron transfer the presence of cnt could remarkably accelerate the degradation rates of brps by fe vi in a wide ph range from 7 to 10 moreover the formed undesired polybrominated products during fe vi cnt oxidation were absorbed on cnt surface and thus removed from treated water the fe vi cnt system was capable of selectively oxidizing electron rich pollutants e g brps and sulfamethoxazole smx but reluctant to iopamidol ipm and nitrobenzene nb high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv formed in situ from the reaction of cnt with fe vi were likely responsible for this activation effect of cnt which was further confirmed via using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe compound comparatively homogeneous reducing agent na2s2o3 could enhance fe vi degradation of brps at ph 7 and 8 while undesired polybrominated products were detected in effluent from fe vi na2s2o3 system these findings have crucial implications for the development of a promising oxidation process by combination of fe vi and cnt for water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromophenols ferrate polybrominated products carbon nanotube high valent metal oxo intermediates 1 introduction bromophenols brps are important industrial monomer compounds that have been comprehensively used for chemical synthesis of flame retardants herbicides and preservatives lu et al 2015 xu et al 2018 the frequent occurrence of brps in water has attracted increasing public concerns because of their potential endocrine disrupting effects fukuchi et al 2014 guan et al 2017a therefore investigation of cost effective technology to remove brps in contaminated water is warranted recent studies have reported that several mild oxidants e g manganese dioxide mno2 permanganate mn vii and laccase can effectively eliminate brps during water and wastewater treatment jiang et al 2014 lin et al 2016 2014 2015 unfortunately these mild oxidation processes would form hydroxyl polybrominated biphenyl ethers oh pbdes and hydroxyl polybrominated biphenyls oh pbbs which have altered or enhanced toxicological effects in comparison with parent brps jiang et al 2014 lin et al 2014 2015 morris et al 2018 over the past decades ferrate fe vi as an emerging oxidant has been extensively studied in drinking and wastewater treatment anquandah et al 2011 eng et al 2006 feng et al 2016 manoli et al 2019 2017 sharma 2013 yang et al 2012 many studies have demonstrated that micropollutants with electron rich moieties including phenolic contaminants amines and olefins can be efficiently degraded by fe vi lee et al 2008 2005 2009 sun et al 2018b for instance lee et al 2005 found that fe vi could effectively degrade 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 a widely used endocrine disrupting chemicals with the apparent second order rate constant k app of 730 m 1s 1 at 25 c and ph 7 j yang et al 2014 have demonstrated that tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa can be readily oxidized by fe vi with k app ranging from 7 9 103 to 3 3 101 m 1s 1 in the ph range of 7 10 however to date limited information is available about degradation kinetics of brps by fe vi and it is unknown whether undesirable pbdes can be formed or not during fe vi treatment interestingly several recent studies have demonstrated that homogeneous reducing agents e g sulfite arsenite and thiosulfate s2o3 2 can activate fe vi to oxidize selected organic pollutants such as trimethoprim tmp bezafibrate bzf and ibuprofen ibp in which s2o3 2 is the most attractive reagent due to its usability security and stability feng et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 for example feng et al 2018 reported that tmp 1 0 μm was completely degraded within 30 s in the presence of 100 μm fe vi and 12 5 μm na2s2o3 at ph 8 this activation effect could be explained by the contribution of high valent iron based intermediates fe v fe iv formed in situ from the reaction of reducing agents with fe vi which were 2 5 orders of magnitude more reactive than fe vi feng et al 2018 sharma and diane 2009 however up to now it is not known whether the heterogeneous reducing agent carbon nanotube cnt can activate fe vi for the abatement of organic pollutants or not comparatively cnt has been used to activate several oxidants including ozone o3 peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to generate high reactive species such as hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 for the degradation of contaminants in water treatment guan et al 2018 2017a nie et al 2018 oulton et al 2015 seo et al 2015 in addition it was found that cnt could effectively alleviate the risks of toxic by products generated from oxidation process due to its high absorbing capacity guan et al 2018 2017a for example guan et al 2018 found that pms cnt system could efficiently degrade brps to form oh pbdes and oh pbbs which were absorbed on cnt surface and did not appear in aqueous solutions the main objective of this work was to investigate the degradation kinetics and products of selected 6 brps 2 bromophenol 2 brp 3 bromophenol 3 brp 4 bromophenol 4 brp 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 dbrp 2 6 dibromophenol 2 6 dbrp and 2 4 6 tribromophenol 2 4 6 tbrp by fe vi in the absence presence of cnt first the oxidation kinetics of brps by fe vi were determined in synthetic waters over a wide ph range of 6 10 and the linear free

chemicals of analytical grade or better were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all solutions were prepared using deionized di water from a milli q purification system millipore billerica ma stock solutions of fe vi were freshly prepared by dissolving solid k2feo4 in buffer solutions 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate ph 9 2 lee et al 2005 sun et al 2018c and were standardized by the direct 510 nm spectrophotometric method ε 1150 m 1 cm 1 stock suspensions of cnt 1 g l 1 were prepared in di water with sonication 42 khz in an ice bath for 12 h and then the suspensions were again subjected to sonication for 10 min before experiments to promote dispersion 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 degradation of brps by fe vi in the absence presence of cnt degradation experiments were conducted in 150 ml conical flask under 25 1 c water bath with magnetic stirring reaction ph 6 was controlled using 20 mm sodium acetate 10 mm borate while ph 7 10 using 10 mm borate and the shift of ph values was always less than 0 2 units during the kinetic runs reactions were initiated by adding fe vi 50 100 μm into ph buffered solutions containing one of the selected brp at desirable concentration 5 10 μm at specified intervals two parallel samples were withdrawn one sample was quenched with excess sodium arsenite naaso2 and filtered through 0 22 μm glass membrane to measure residual brps by hplc and the other was filtered through 0 22 μm glass membrane and quenched by excess abts to measure residual fe vi by the abts spectrophotometric method further experiments were performed to evaluate the impacts of cnt on the degradation of brps by fe vi following the similar procedure described above except that fe vi and cnt were simultaneously added into ph buffered solutions containing 3 brp in addition cnt was oxidized with nitric acid as described by wepasnick et al 2011 to investigate the effects of pre oxidized cnt on the degradation of brps by fe vi the details on the preparation and characterization of pre oxidized cnt were presented in supplementary material sm text s1 figs s1 s3 and table s1 to evaluate the reusability of cnt the spent cnt was collected by centrifugation then the obtained cnt was washed with methanol and di water in sequence for three times and freeze dried before next use all experiments were performed in triplicates at 25 1 c the average data and standard deviations were shown 2 2 2 transformation products for identification of transformation products a series of ph buffered solutions ph 8 containing one selected brps 10 μm were treated by fe vi with various doses 20 100 μm at specified intervals the resulting solutions were quenched with excess naaso2 then one samples were filtered through 0 22 μm glass membrane before analysis by hplc esi qqqms the other samples were freeze dried the obtained residues were dissolved with dichloromethane before analysis using gc ms to evaluate the effect of cnt on degradation products the reaction solutions containing 3 brp 10 μm was prepared and then 100 μm fe vi and 50 mg l 1 cnt were added to start the reaction the resulting solutions were quenched at predetermined time intervals and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min to separate cnt from solutions then the obtained supernatant was directly analyzed by hplc esi qqqms the sedimentary cnt was eluted by 4 ml methanol under ice water mixture conditions with sonication 42 khz for 10 min subsequently the mixture was centrifuged and the obtained organic supernatant was also analyzed by hplc esi qqqms 2 3 analytical

using analytikjena multi n c 3100 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics of fe vi with brps the oxidation kinetics of fe vi with brps were evaluated over the ph range of 6 10 as fig s4 shown the reaction was first order with respect to both 4 brp fig s1 a and fe vi fig s1 b thus the oxidation kinetics of fe vi with brps could be expressed by eq 1 1 d b r p d t k a p p f e v i b r p considering the self decay of fe vi in acid and neutral ph eq 2 is employed to analyze the reaction kinetics of fe vi with brps over a wide ph range of 6 10 2 ln b rp t b r p 0 k a p p 0 t f e v i d t where k app represents the apparent second order rate constant of fe vi with brp brp t and brp 0 are the concentrations of brp at the time t and zero respectively as well as 0 t f e v i d t is fe vi concentrations integrated over time namely the fe vi exposure thus the k app could be obtained in the ph range of 6 10 via simultaneously measuring the loss of fe vi and brp the apparent second order rate constants k app of fe vi with brps were shown in fig 1 as can be seen the measured k app of fe vi with brps ranged from 1 8 to 1850 m 1s 1 in a wide ph range of 6 10 which was highly governed by ph and exhibited the highest value at ph near the mean of pka values of fe vi and brp pka fe vi pka brp 2 this high dependence on ph could be quantitatively described by the commonly used kinetic model fig 1 which involved the parallel reactions between fe vi species and brps species lee et al 2005 sharma 2013 for details see text s3 and table s3 in addition the linear free energy relationships between rate constants obtained in the model and hammett constants for brps were found to be in line with previous studies lee et al 2005 lee and von gunten 2012 for details see text s3 and fig s5 3 2 transformation products 3 2 1 identification of products recently precursor ion scan pis mode equipped with hplc esi qqqms hplc esi qqqms pis has been frequently applied to selectively detect polar bromine containing organic compounds by setting piss of m z 79 81 jiang et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 considering bromine atom in bromophenols this mode was applied to detect the brominated transformation products of brps by fe vi at ph 8 where the maxima of k app for 3 brp 4 brp and 2 4 dbrp were obtained in the studied ph range as shown in fig 2 compared to the control samples without treatment by fe vi two new peaks appeared in the chromatograms of samples containing 3 brp treated by fe vi at ph 8 via pis approach by setting m z of 79 and 81 as can be seen from figure 2 3 brp was eluted at 26 62 min with the molecular ions of m z 171 and 173 in the pis of m z 79 and 81 respectively fig 2 b and d products i and ii at the chromatogram retention time of 28 76 min and 36 12 min respectively shared the same molecular ions of m z 341 343 and 343 345 in the pis of m z 79 and 81 respectively fig 2 c and e considering the same retention time and intensities of the peaks obtained by pis mode at m z 79 and 81 products i and ii should be the dimers of 3 brp according to previous studies products i and ii were assigned to dibrominated phenoxyphenols or dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls jiang et al 2014 lin et al 2014 2015 similarly oh pbdes and oh pbbs products were also detected during the degradation of 4 brp and 2 4 dbrp by fe vi figs s6 and s7 in addition low molecular debromination products such as hydroquinone benzoquinone and maleic acid were also identified by gc ms table s4 the formation of these products from bromophenols was also reported in the case of photocatalysis and electrochemistry oxidation yang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 in addition the time course profiles of products i and ii formed from 3 brp 10 μm treated by 100 μm fe vi at ph 8 were monitored by hplc esi mrm as presented in fig s8 the levels of products i and ii reached to their maxima at 3 min and then gradually decreased within 10 min these results indicated that products i and ii could further be degraded by fe vi moreover it was found that 25 of toc was removed when 80 of 3 brp 10 μm was degraded by fe vi 100 μm at 10 min fig s9 this result indicated that fe vi degradation only resulted in partial mineralization of 3 brp which was line with the previous studies li et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 3 2 2 formation of inorganic bromine species the generation of inorganic bromine species br and bro3 was monitored during the oxidation of 3 brp by fe vi fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the concentration of br released from 3 brp steadily increased with the degradation of 3 brp while no bro3 was detected data not shown for example the concentration of br released from 3 brp gradually increased to 1 2 μm at 10 min accompanied with 80 of 3 brp 10 μm degraded similarly the release of br accompanied with the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a by fe vi has been recently reported han et al 2018 3 2 3 proposed degradation pathway based on the detected degradation products two possible reaction pathways for the transformation of 3 brp by fe vi were proposed as can be seen in fig s10 fe vi could react with 3 brp via one electron transfer to form 3 brp radical similar one electron reactions have been reported in the reactions of fe vi with phenol chlorophene and aniline chen et al 2018 huang et al 2001 sun et al 2018b due to the delocalization of unpaired electron in 3 brp radical it could be converted into three different radical forms jiang et al 2014 subsequently two 3 brp radicals underwent coupling reaction through co or cc pathway to generate dimer products in theory there were nine possible coupling reaction between different 3 brp radicals in which three different co coupling reactions resulted in the formation of dibrominated phenoxyphenol isomers fig s10 1 3 and six different cc polymerization lead to the generation of dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyl isomers fig s10 4 9 in parallel the cbr bond of 3 brp might be attacked by fe vi leading to the release of br and the formation of low molecular debromination intermediates fig s10 han et al 2018 reported that the reaction of tetrabromobisphenol a and fe vi also proceeded via debromination reaction leading to the release of br and the formation of debromination products then the low molecular debromination intermediates could be further oxidized to maleic acid similar reaction pathways were also observed in fe vi oxidation of chlorophene and acetaminophen chen et al 2018 wang et al 2016 3 3 effect of cnt on the degradation of brps by fe vi several studies have demonstrated that cnt can accelerate some oxidants e g o3 pms pds through inducing the generation of high reactive species for degradation of pollutants guan et al 2018 2017a oulton et al 2015 to investigate the effect of cnt on the transformation of brps by fe vi 3 brp was chosen as the target contaminant 3 3 1 effect on degradation kinetics degradation experiments were carried out in the presence of 10 μm 3 brp and 100 μm fe vi at ph 8 with cnt at different concentrations 25 100 mg l 1 the time courses of 3 brp and fe vi under various conditions were presented in fig 4 notably the adsorption of 3 brp by different concentrations of cnt could be negligible in control experiments fig s11 as can be seen from fig 4 a cnt significantly accelerated the oxidation rates of 3 brp by fe vi and this enhancement became more obvious with increasing the concentrations of cnt fig 4 a for example the pseudo first order rate constant of 3 brp increased from 0 0034 s 1 in the case of fe vi alone to 0 0059 s 1 0 011 s 1 and 0 016 s 1 with the addition of 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 cnt respectively fig 4 a as presented in fig 4 b the decomposition rates of fe vi generally accelerated with cnt concentrations increase compared to control experiment without cnt for instance the decay of fe vi within 3 min increased from 16 to 36 51 and 73 in the presence of 25 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 and 100 mg l 1 cnt respectively in other words despite fe vi exposure obviously decreased due to the consumption of fe vi by cnt the degradation rate of 3 brp still increased in the presence of cnt in addition the enhancement effect of cnt was also observed under other investigated ph 7 9 and 10 for details see text s4 and figs s12 s13 3 3 2 effect on formation of products the degradation products of 3 brp by fe vi were also monitored in the presence of cnt as shown in fig s14 no polybrominated products were detected from the treated effluent in the presence of cnt however polybrominated products products i and ii were detected in meoh supernatant after extracting spent cnt this result indicated that the formed undesired polybrominated products were absorbed on cnt surface and removed from effluent compared to brps the sorption capacity of cnt for polybrominated products was much higher and similar results were also observed in previous studies guan et al 2018 2017a based on previous literature this discrepancy was probably explained by the following reasons 1 polybrominated products contained two benzene rings leading to their electron density enhancement which induced the stronger electron donor acceptor interaction between polybrominated products and cnt long and yang 2001 2 the n octanol water portioning coefficients kow of polybrominated products 4 67 6 17 were higher than that of 3 brp 2 63 therefore the solubility of polybrominated products was lower and they were prone to adsorb on cnt surface yu et al 2008 3 cnt was negatively charged under ph 8 fig s15 while the pka values of polybrominated products 9 0 9 3 were slightly higher than that of 3 brp 8 87 xie et al 2013 rayne and forest 2010 thus the repulsion effect between cnt and 3 brp was stronger than that of polybrominated products consequently fe vi cnt system was a promising technology for abatement brps with avoiding poisonous byproducts in treated water moreover the evolution of 3 brp degradation products in fe vi cnt system was also monitored as presented in fig s16 the levels of products i and ii rapidly reached to their maxima at 1 min and then gradually decreased within 3 min and this trend was similar to that of fe vi oxidation alone in addition as presented in fig s9 around 60 of toc was removed in fe vi cnt system which was obviously higher than that of fe vi alone 25 this enhancement of toc removal might be ascribed to the adsorption of 3 brp degradation intermediates on cnt surface guan et al 2018 3 3 3 degradation of other selected pollutants by fe vi cnt system to obtain further insight into the fe vi cnt system the degradation of other selected organic pollutants ppl smx ipm and nb 5 μm by the combination of 100 μm fe vi and 50 mg l 1 cnt was also investigated at ph 8 cnt could accelerate fe vi oxidation of ppl and smx but it had no role in acceleration fe vi removal of ipm and nb fig 5 as presented in fig 5 b the transformation efficiency of smx within 7 min was 32 and 6 in the presence of fe vi and cnt alone respectively comparatively about 86 of smx was rapidly removed in the presence of both fe vi and cnt which was dramatically higher than the sum of smx removal by alone fe vi and alone cnt 38 however the removal of ipm by fe vi cnt system was only 18 which was less than the sum of ipm degradation by alone fe vi 12 and alone cnt 11 fig 5 c these results suggested that the formed reactive oxidizing species in fe vi cnt system were selective oxidants rather than non selective oxidants e g hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 3 3 4 mechanism of fe vi cnt system for enhanced degradation of brps recently feng et al 2018 have demonstrated that homogeneous reducing agent na2s2o3 could react with fe vi to generate high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv which were 2 5 orders of magnitude more reactive than fe vi and led to the enhanced fe vi degradation of micropollutants interestingly several studies have found that carbon materials e g powdered activated carbon pac and cnt have reductive property to reduce metal ions e g fe iii cu ii choi et al 2002 seo et al 2015 given the reductive properties of cnt it seems likely that cnt could rapidly react with fe vi to generate fe v fe iv thus leading to the degradation of 3 brp enhancement moreover li et al 2018 and shao et al 2019 recently reported that fe v fe iv as selective oxidant was more susceptible to degrade pollutants with electron rich groups e g bisphenol a p chlorophenol and smx and hardly oxidize electron depleted organic pollutants e g benzoic acid and nb which was line with the results in 3 3 3 section to confirm this possible speculation the effect of pre oxidized cnt by concentrated nitric acid to alleviate the reductive properties of cnt on the degradation of 3 brp 10 μm by 100 μm fe vi was comparatively evaluated to better understand the changes in surface chemical properties induced by nitric acid oxidation cnt and pre oxidized cnt were characterized by xps and ft ir for details see sm text s1 figs s1 s3 and table s1 the analysis of xps and ft ir suggested the phenolic hydroxyl groups on pre oxidized cnt surface slightly decreased and meanwhile the carboxyl groups on pre oxidized cnt surface increased as shown in fig 6 compared to virgin cnt the enhancement effect of pre oxidized cnt with nitric acid apparently weakened the degradation efficiency of 3 brp at 3 min with pre oxidized cnt by hno3 62 was lower than that with pristine cnt 100 and slightly higher than that without cnt 52 this result confirmed that the reductive properties of cnt played a crucial role during the degradation of 3 brp by fe vi cnt system based on the results of xps and ft ir analysis it seemed likely that phenolic hydroxyl groups on cnt surface reacted with fe vi to generate fe v fe iv leading to the enhanced degradation of brps these results above suggested that intermediates fe v fe iv generated from the reaction of fe vi with cnt were responsible for the enhancement of the degradation rates of brps in the fe vi cnt system very recently several studies have demonstrated that sulfoxides e g dmso pmso as chemical probes can be oxidized to sulfones e g dmso2 pmso2 by high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv wang et al 2018 li et al 2018 shao et al 2019 to further confirm the generation of fe v fe iv in fe vi cnt system the effect of dmso pmso on 3 brp degradation by fe vi cnt system was evaluated as shown in fig s17 the degradation of 3 brp was clearly inhibited in the presence of dmso pmso while the decay of fe vi was hardly influenced in the presence of dmso pmso this result indicated that the inhibition of 3 brp degradation was mainly due to the competition for fe v fe iv rather than fe vi meanwhile the degradation of pmso and the generation of pmso2 in fe vi and fe vi cnt system were investigated as shown in fig 7 the degradation of pmso in fe vi cnt system was significantly faster than in fe vi system for example the degradation efficiency of pmso at 3 min was 34 and 71 in fe vi and fe vi cnt system respectively moreover the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 the molar ratio of formed pmso2 to degraded pmso always approached to 100 in fe vi cnt system the above results further confirmed that high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv were formed in fe vi cnt system 3 3 5 reusability of cnt the repetitive experiments were performed to evaluate the reusability of cnt for fe vi activation as shown in fig s18 cnt maintained its activation performance for the first two cycles and then the activation performance of cnt gradually reduced after two cycles for example approximately 90 of 3 brp were degraded in 3 min for the first and second runs while the degradation of 3 brp decreased to 76 and 70 for the third and fourth cycles this result might be explained by the gradual decrease of the reductive property of cnt after reuse 3 4 comparison to fe vi na2s2o3 system very recently the activation of fe vi by reducing agent na2s2o3 to enhance the oxidation of organic pollutants was reported at ph 8 feng et al 2018 in which the degradation efficiency of tmp by 100 μm fe vi increased from 10 without na2s2o3 to 100 with 12 5 μm na2s2o3 in 30 s this enhancement was ascribed to high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv originated from the reaction of na2s2o3 with fe vi feng et al 2018 interestingly it was noted that in the previous study of feng et al 2018 the experimental condition was always set at ph 8 to better understand the fe vi na2s2o3 system the degradation of 3 brp by 100 μm fe vi without and with 12 5 μm na2s2o3 was investigated in a wide ph range of 7 10 as presented in fig 8 the distinct enhancement was observed in fe vi na2s2o3 system at ph 7 and 8 in which the oxidation of 3 brp showed biphasic kinetics an initial instant 3 brp loss followed by a secondary slow decomposition phase for instance the degradation efficiency of 3 brp within 30 s increased from 3 with fe vi alone to 60 in fe vi na2s2o3 system at ph 8 while only 40 of 3 brp was degraded in the following 10 min in fe vi na2s2o3 system however negligible enhancement was observed under ph 9 and 10 fig 8 in addition the effect of na2s2o3 on degradation products of 3 brp by fe vi was also investigated compared to alone fe vi oxidation dibrominated phenoxyphenols and dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls were also detected in effluent by fe vi na2s2o3 system indicating that na2s2o3 could enhance the degradation of 3 brp but could not alleviate the risk of undesirable polybrominated products in aqueous solutions 4 conclusion this study is the first report on the activation of fe vi by cnt for the degradation of contaminants in water treatment according to the experimental data the following conclusions were drawn 1 fe vi could degrade brps over a wide ph range from 6 to 10 with apparent second order rate constants of 1 8 1850 m 1s 1 which was highly depended on ph and exhibited the highest value at ph near the mean of pka values of fe vi and brp 2 the undesirable dibrominated phenoxyphenols and dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls were formed via coupling reaction of brps radicals generated from fe vi oxidation through one electron transfer 3 cnt could accelerate the degradation of brps ppl and smx by fe vi which was attributed to the high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv generated from the reaction of fe vi with cnt 4 moreover cnt could absorb formed polybrominated products during fe vi oxidation and thereby alleviating the potential risks of polybrominated diphenyl products in effluent these results show great implications for comprehensive understanding the application of fe vi and cnt in degradation organic pollutants

18888,very recently several studies have found that homogeneous reducing agents e g sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 and sodium sulfite na2so3 can activate ferrate to enhance the degradation of selected contaminants in this work it was found that heterogeneous carbon nanotube cnt could accelerate ferrate fe vi for the degradation of bromophenols brps of environmental concerns and alleviate the appearance of undesired by products in effluent fe vi could react with brps over a wide ph range of 6 10 with apparent second order rate constants of 1 8 1850 m 1 s 1 electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry esi qqqms analysis showed that dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls and dibrominated phenoxyphenols were possibly formed via coupling reaction of brps radicals generated from fe vi oxidation through one electron transfer the presence of cnt could remarkably accelerate the degradation rates of brps by fe vi in a wide ph range from 7 to 10 moreover the formed undesired polybrominated products during fe vi cnt oxidation were absorbed on cnt surface and thus removed from treated water the fe vi cnt system was capable of selectively oxidizing electron rich pollutants e g brps and sulfamethoxazole smx but reluctant to iopamidol ipm and nitrobenzene nb high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv formed in situ from the reaction of cnt with fe vi were likely responsible for this activation effect of cnt which was further confirmed via using methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe compound comparatively homogeneous reducing agent na2s2o3 could enhance fe vi degradation of brps at ph 7 and 8 while undesired polybrominated products were detected in effluent from fe vi na2s2o3 system these findings have crucial implications for the development of a promising oxidation process by combination of fe vi and cnt for water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromophenols ferrate polybrominated products carbon nanotube high valent metal oxo intermediates 1 introduction bromophenols brps are important industrial monomer compounds that have been comprehensively used for chemical synthesis of flame retardants herbicides and preservatives lu et al 2015 xu et al 2018 the frequent occurrence of brps in water has attracted increasing public concerns because of their potential endocrine disrupting effects fukuchi et al 2014 guan et al 2017a therefore investigation of cost effective technology to remove brps in contaminated water is warranted recent studies have reported that several mild oxidants e g manganese dioxide mno2 permanganate mn vii and laccase can effectively eliminate brps during water and wastewater treatment jiang et al 2014 lin et al 2016 2014 2015 unfortunately these mild oxidation processes would form hydroxyl polybrominated biphenyl ethers oh pbdes and hydroxyl polybrominated biphenyls oh pbbs which have altered or enhanced toxicological effects in comparison with parent brps jiang et al 2014 lin et al 2014 2015 morris et al 2018 over the past decades ferrate fe vi as an emerging oxidant has been extensively studied in drinking and wastewater treatment anquandah et al 2011 eng et al 2006 feng et al 2016 manoli et al 2019 2017 sharma 2013 yang et al 2012 many studies have demonstrated that micropollutants with electron rich moieties including phenolic contaminants amines and olefins can be efficiently degraded by fe vi lee et al 2008 2005 2009 sun et al 2018b for instance lee et al 2005 found that fe vi could effectively degrade 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 a widely used endocrine disrupting chemicals with the apparent second order rate constant k app of 730 m 1s 1 at 25 c and ph 7 j yang et al 2014 have demonstrated that tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa can be readily oxidized by fe vi with k app ranging from 7 9 103 to 3 3 101 m 1s 1 in the ph range of 7 10 however to date limited information is available about degradation kinetics of brps by fe vi and it is unknown whether undesirable pbdes can be formed or not during fe vi treatment interestingly several recent studies have demonstrated that homogeneous reducing agents e g sulfite arsenite and thiosulfate s2o3 2 can activate fe vi to oxidize selected organic pollutants such as trimethoprim tmp bezafibrate bzf and ibuprofen ibp in which s2o3 2 is the most attractive reagent due to its usability security and stability feng et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 for example feng et al 2018 reported that tmp 1 0 μm was completely degraded within 30 s in the presence of 100 μm fe vi and 12 5 μm na2s2o3 at ph 8 this activation effect could be explained by the contribution of high valent iron based intermediates fe v fe iv formed in situ from the reaction of reducing agents with fe vi which were 2 5 orders of magnitude more reactive than fe vi feng et al 2018 sharma and diane 2009 however up to now it is not known whether the heterogeneous reducing agent carbon nanotube cnt can activate fe vi for the abatement of organic pollutants or not comparatively cnt has been used to activate several oxidants including ozone o3 peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to generate high reactive species such as hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 for the degradation of contaminants in water treatment guan et al 2018 2017a nie et al 2018 oulton et al 2015 seo et al 2015 in addition it was found that cnt could effectively alleviate the risks of toxic by products generated from oxidation process due to its high absorbing capacity guan et al 2018 2017a for example guan et al 2018 found that pms cnt system could efficiently degrade brps to form oh pbdes and oh pbbs which were absorbed on cnt surface and did not appear in aqueous solutions the main objective of this work was to investigate the degradation kinetics and products of selected 6 brps 2 bromophenol 2 brp 3 bromophenol 3 brp 4 bromophenol 4 brp 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 dbrp 2 6 dibromophenol 2 6 dbrp and 2 4 6 tribromophenol 2 4 6 tbrp by fe vi in the absence presence of cnt first the oxidation kinetics of brps by fe vi were determined in synthetic waters over a wide ph range of 6 10 and the linear free

billerica ma stock solutions of fe vi were freshly prepared by dissolving solid k2feo4 in buffer solutions 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate ph 9 2 lee et al 2005 sun et al 2018c and were standardized by the direct 510 nm spectrophotometric method ε 1150 m 1 cm 1 stock suspensions of cnt 1 g l 1 were prepared in di water with sonication 42 khz in an ice bath for 12 h and then the suspensions were again subjected to sonication for 10 min before experiments to promote dispersion 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 degradation of brps by fe vi in the absence presence of cnt degradation experiments were conducted in 150 ml conical flask under 25 1 c water bath with magnetic stirring reaction ph 6 was controlled using 20 mm sodium acetate 10 mm borate while ph 7 10 using 10 mm borate and the shift of ph values was always less than 0 2 units during the kinetic runs reactions were initiated by adding fe vi 50 100 μm into ph buffered solutions containing one of the selected brp at desirable concentration 5 10 μm at specified intervals two parallel samples were withdrawn one sample was quenched with excess sodium arsenite naaso2 and filtered through 0 22 μm glass membrane to measure residual brps by hplc and the other was filtered through 0 22 μm glass membrane and quenched by excess abts to measure residual fe vi by the abts spectrophotometric method further experiments were performed to evaluate the impacts of cnt on the degradation of brps by fe vi following the similar procedure described above except that fe vi and cnt were simultaneously added into ph buffered solutions containing 3 brp in addition cnt was oxidized with nitric acid as described by wepasnick et al 2011 to investigate the effects of pre oxidized cnt on the degradation of brps by fe vi the details on the preparation and characterization of pre oxidized cnt were presented in supplementary material sm text s1 figs s1 s3 and table s1 to evaluate the reusability of cnt the spent cnt was collected by centrifugation then the obtained cnt was washed with methanol and di water in sequence for three times and freeze dried before next use all experiments were performed in triplicates at 25 1 c the average data and standard deviations were shown 2 2 2 transformation products for identification of transformation products a series of ph buffered solutions ph 8 containing one selected brps 10 μm were treated by fe vi with various doses 20 100 μm at specified intervals the resulting solutions were quenched with excess naaso2 then one samples were filtered through 0 22 μm glass membrane before analysis by hplc esi qqqms the other samples were freeze dried the obtained residues were dissolved with dichloromethane before analysis using gc ms to evaluate the effect of cnt on degradation products the reaction solutions containing 3 brp 10 μm was prepared and then 100 μm fe vi and 50 mg l 1 cnt were added to start the reaction the resulting solutions were quenched at predetermined time intervals and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min to separate cnt from solutions then the obtained supernatant was directly analyzed by hplc esi qqqms the sedimentary cnt was eluted by 4 ml methanol under ice water mixture conditions with sonication 42 khz for 10 min subsequently the mixture was centrifuged and the obtained organic supernatant was also analyzed by hplc esi qqqms 2 3 analytical

using analytikjena multi n c 3100 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics of fe vi with brps the oxidation kinetics of fe vi with brps were evaluated over the ph range of 6 10 as fig s4 shown the reaction was first order with respect to both 4 brp fig s1 a and fe vi fig s1 b thus the oxidation kinetics of fe vi with brps could be expressed by eq 1 1 d b r p d t k a p p f e v i b r p considering the self decay of fe vi in acid and neutral ph eq 2 is employed to analyze the reaction kinetics of fe vi with brps over a wide ph range of 6 10 2 ln b rp t b r p 0 k a p p 0 t f e v i d t where k app represents the apparent second order rate constant of fe vi with brp brp t and brp 0 are the concentrations of brp at the time t and zero respectively as well as 0 t f e v i d t is fe vi concentrations integrated over time namely the fe vi exposure thus the k app could be obtained in the ph range of 6 10 via simultaneously measuring the loss of fe vi and brp the apparent second order rate constants k app of fe vi with brps were shown in fig 1 as can be seen the measured k app of fe vi with brps ranged from 1 8 to 1850 m 1s 1 in a wide ph range of 6 10 which was highly governed by ph and exhibited the highest value at ph near the mean of pka values of fe vi and brp pka fe vi pka brp 2 this high dependence on ph could be quantitatively described by the commonly used kinetic model fig 1 which involved the parallel reactions between fe vi species and brps species lee et al 2005 sharma 2013 for details see text s3 and table s3 in addition the linear free energy relationships between rate constants obtained in the model and hammett constants for brps were found to be in line with previous studies lee et al 2005 lee and von gunten 2012 for details see text s3 and fig s5 3 2 transformation products 3 2 1 identification of products recently precursor ion scan pis mode equipped with hplc esi qqqms hplc esi qqqms pis has been frequently applied to selectively detect polar bromine containing organic compounds by setting piss of m z 79 81 jiang et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 considering bromine atom in bromophenols this mode was applied to detect the brominated transformation products of brps by fe vi at ph 8 where the maxima of k app for 3 brp 4 brp and 2 4 dbrp were obtained in the studied ph range as shown in fig 2 compared to the control samples without treatment by fe vi two new peaks appeared in the chromatograms of samples containing 3 brp treated by fe vi at ph 8 via pis approach by setting m z of 79 and 81 as can be seen from figure 2 3 brp was eluted at 26 62 min with the molecular ions of m z 171 and 173 in the pis of m z 79 and 81 respectively fig 2 b and d products i and ii at the chromatogram retention time of 28 76 min and 36 12 min respectively shared the same molecular ions of m z 341 343 and 343 345 in the pis of m z 79 and 81 respectively fig 2 c and e considering the same retention time and intensities of the peaks obtained by pis mode at m z 79 and 81 products i and ii should be the dimers of 3 brp according to previous studies products i and ii were assigned to dibrominated phenoxyphenols or dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls jiang et al 2014 lin et al 2014 2015 similarly oh pbdes and oh pbbs products were also detected during the degradation of 4 brp and 2 4 dbrp by fe vi figs s6 and s7 in addition low molecular debromination products such as hydroquinone benzoquinone and maleic acid were also identified by gc ms table s4 the formation of these products from bromophenols was also reported in the case of photocatalysis and electrochemistry oxidation yang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 in addition the time course profiles of products i and ii formed from 3 brp 10 μm treated by 100 μm fe vi at ph 8 were monitored by hplc esi mrm as presented in fig s8 the levels of products i and ii reached to their maxima at 3 min and then gradually decreased within 10 min these results indicated that products i and ii could further be degraded by fe vi moreover it was found that 25 of toc was removed when 80 of 3 brp 10 μm was degraded by fe vi 100 μm at 10 min fig s9 this result indicated that fe vi degradation only resulted in partial mineralization of 3 brp which was line with the previous studies li et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 3 2 2 formation of inorganic bromine species the generation of inorganic bromine species br and bro3 was monitored during the oxidation of 3 brp by fe vi fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the concentration of br released from 3 brp steadily increased with the degradation of 3 brp while no bro3 was detected data not shown for example the concentration of br released from 3 brp gradually increased to 1 2 μm at 10 min accompanied with 80 of 3 brp 10 μm degraded similarly the release of br accompanied with the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a by fe vi has been recently reported han et al 2018 3 2 3 proposed degradation pathway based on the detected degradation products two possible reaction pathways for the transformation of 3 brp by fe vi were proposed as can be seen in fig s10 fe vi could react with 3 brp via one electron transfer to form 3 brp radical similar one electron reactions have been reported in the reactions of fe vi with phenol chlorophene and aniline chen et al 2018 huang et al 2001 sun et al 2018b due to the delocalization of unpaired electron in 3 brp radical it could be converted into three different radical forms jiang et al 2014 subsequently two 3 brp radicals underwent coupling reaction through co or cc pathway to generate dimer products in theory there were nine possible coupling reaction between different 3 brp radicals in which three different co coupling reactions resulted in the formation of dibrominated phenoxyphenol isomers fig s10 1 3 and six different cc polymerization lead to the generation of dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyl isomers fig s10 4 9 in parallel the cbr bond of 3 brp might be attacked by fe vi leading to the release of br and the formation of low molecular debromination intermediates fig s10 han et al 2018 reported that the reaction of tetrabromobisphenol a and fe vi also proceeded via debromination reaction leading to the release of br and the formation of debromination products then the low molecular debromination intermediates could be further oxidized to maleic acid similar reaction pathways were also observed in fe vi oxidation of chlorophene and acetaminophen chen et al 2018 wang et al 2016 3 3 effect of cnt on the degradation of brps by fe vi several studies have demonstrated that cnt can accelerate some oxidants e g o3 pms pds through inducing the generation of high reactive species for degradation of pollutants guan et al 2018 2017a oulton et al 2015 to investigate the effect of cnt on the transformation of brps by fe vi 3 brp was chosen as the target contaminant 3 3 1 effect on degradation kinetics degradation experiments were carried out in the presence of 10 μm 3 brp and 100 μm fe vi at ph 8 with cnt at different concentrations 25 100 mg l 1 the time courses of 3 brp and fe vi under various conditions were presented in fig 4 notably the adsorption of 3 brp by different concentrations of cnt could be negligible in control experiments fig s11 as can be seen from fig 4 a cnt significantly accelerated the oxidation rates of 3 brp by fe vi and this enhancement became more obvious with increasing the concentrations of cnt fig 4 a for example the pseudo first order rate constant of 3 brp increased from 0 0034 s 1 in the case of fe vi alone to 0 0059 s 1 0 011 s 1 and 0 016 s 1 with the addition of 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 cnt respectively fig 4 a as presented in fig 4 b the decomposition rates of fe vi generally accelerated with cnt concentrations increase compared to control experiment without cnt for instance the decay of fe vi within 3 min increased from 16 to 36 51 and 73 in the presence of 25 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 and 100 mg l 1 cnt respectively in other words despite fe vi exposure obviously decreased due to the consumption of fe vi by cnt the degradation rate of 3 brp still increased in the presence of cnt in addition the enhancement effect of cnt was also observed under other investigated ph 7 9 and 10 for details see text s4 and figs s12 s13 3 3 2 effect on formation of products the degradation products of 3 brp by fe vi were also monitored in the presence of cnt as shown in fig s14 no polybrominated products were detected from the treated effluent in the presence of cnt however polybrominated products products i and ii were detected in meoh supernatant after extracting spent cnt this result indicated that the formed undesired polybrominated products were absorbed on cnt surface and removed from effluent compared to brps the sorption capacity of cnt for polybrominated products was much higher and similar results were also observed in previous studies guan et al 2018 2017a based on previous literature this discrepancy was probably explained by the following reasons 1 polybrominated products contained two benzene rings leading to their electron density enhancement which induced the stronger electron donor acceptor interaction between polybrominated products and cnt long and yang 2001 2 the n octanol water portioning coefficients kow of polybrominated products 4 67 6 17 were higher than that of 3 brp 2 63 therefore the solubility of polybrominated products was lower and they were prone to adsorb on cnt surface yu et al 2008 3 cnt was negatively charged under ph 8 fig s15 while the pka values of polybrominated products 9 0 9 3 were slightly higher than that of 3 brp 8 87 xie et al 2013 rayne and forest 2010 thus the repulsion effect between cnt and 3 brp was stronger than that of polybrominated products consequently fe vi cnt system was a promising technology for abatement brps with avoiding poisonous byproducts in treated water moreover the evolution of 3 brp degradation products in fe vi cnt system was also monitored as presented in fig s16 the levels of products i and ii rapidly reached to their maxima at 1 min and then gradually decreased within 3 min and this trend was similar to that of fe vi oxidation alone in addition as presented in fig s9 around 60 of toc was removed in fe vi cnt system which was obviously higher than that of fe vi alone 25 this enhancement of toc removal might be ascribed to the adsorption of 3 brp degradation intermediates on cnt surface guan et al 2018 3 3 3 degradation of other selected pollutants by fe vi cnt system to obtain further insight into the fe vi cnt system the degradation of other selected organic pollutants ppl smx ipm and nb 5 μm by the combination of 100 μm fe vi and 50 mg l 1 cnt was also investigated at ph 8 cnt could accelerate fe vi oxidation of ppl and smx but it had no role in acceleration fe vi removal of ipm and nb fig 5 as presented in fig 5 b the transformation efficiency of smx within 7 min was 32 and 6 in the presence of fe vi and cnt alone respectively comparatively about 86 of smx was rapidly removed in the presence of both fe vi and cnt which was dramatically higher than the sum of smx removal by alone fe vi and alone cnt 38 however the removal of ipm by fe vi cnt system was only 18 which was less than the sum of ipm degradation by alone fe vi 12 and alone cnt 11 fig 5 c these results suggested that the formed reactive oxidizing species in fe vi cnt system were selective oxidants rather than non selective oxidants e g hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 3 3 4 mechanism of fe vi cnt system for enhanced degradation of brps recently feng et al 2018 have demonstrated that homogeneous reducing agent na2s2o3 could react with fe vi to generate high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv which were 2 5 orders of magnitude more reactive than fe vi and led to the enhanced fe vi degradation of micropollutants interestingly several studies have found that carbon materials e g powdered activated carbon pac and cnt have reductive property to reduce metal ions e g fe iii cu ii choi et al 2002 seo et al 2015 given the reductive properties of cnt it seems likely that cnt could rapidly react with fe vi to generate fe v fe iv thus leading to the degradation of 3 brp enhancement moreover li et al 2018 and shao et al 2019 recently reported that fe v fe iv as selective oxidant was more susceptible to degrade pollutants with electron rich groups e g bisphenol a p chlorophenol and smx and hardly oxidize electron depleted organic pollutants e g benzoic acid and nb which was line with the results in 3 3 3 section to confirm this possible speculation the effect of pre oxidized cnt by concentrated nitric acid to alleviate the reductive properties of cnt on the degradation of 3 brp 10 μm by 100 μm fe vi was comparatively evaluated to better understand the changes in surface chemical properties induced by nitric acid oxidation cnt and pre oxidized cnt were characterized by xps and ft ir for details see sm text s1 figs s1 s3 and table s1 the analysis of xps and ft ir suggested the phenolic hydroxyl groups on pre oxidized cnt surface slightly decreased and meanwhile the carboxyl groups on pre oxidized cnt surface increased as shown in fig 6 compared to virgin cnt the enhancement effect of pre oxidized cnt with nitric acid apparently weakened the degradation efficiency of 3 brp at 3 min with pre oxidized cnt by hno3 62 was lower than that with pristine cnt 100 and slightly higher than that without cnt 52 this result confirmed that the reductive properties of cnt played a crucial role during the degradation of 3 brp by fe vi cnt system based on the results of xps and ft ir analysis it seemed likely that phenolic hydroxyl groups on cnt surface reacted with fe vi to generate fe v fe iv leading to the enhanced degradation of brps these results above suggested that intermediates fe v fe iv generated from the reaction of fe vi with cnt were responsible for the enhancement of the degradation rates of brps in the fe vi cnt system very recently several studies have demonstrated that sulfoxides e g dmso pmso as chemical probes can be oxidized to sulfones e g dmso2 pmso2 by high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv wang et al 2018 li et al 2018 shao et al 2019 to further confirm the generation of fe v fe iv in fe vi cnt system the effect of dmso pmso on 3 brp degradation by fe vi cnt system was evaluated as shown in fig s17 the degradation of 3 brp was clearly inhibited in the presence of dmso pmso while the decay of fe vi was hardly influenced in the presence of dmso pmso this result indicated that the inhibition of 3 brp degradation was mainly due to the competition for fe v fe iv rather than fe vi meanwhile the degradation of pmso and the generation of pmso2 in fe vi and fe vi cnt system were investigated as shown in fig 7 the degradation of pmso in fe vi cnt system was significantly faster than in fe vi system for example the degradation efficiency of pmso at 3 min was 34 and 71 in fe vi and fe vi cnt system respectively moreover the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 the molar ratio of formed pmso2 to degraded pmso always approached to 100 in fe vi cnt system the above results further confirmed that high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv were formed in fe vi cnt system 3 3 5 reusability of cnt the repetitive experiments were performed to evaluate the reusability of cnt for fe vi activation as shown in fig s18 cnt maintained its activation performance for the first two cycles and then the activation performance of cnt gradually reduced after two cycles for example approximately 90 of 3 brp were degraded in 3 min for the first and second runs while the degradation of 3 brp decreased to 76 and 70 for the third and fourth cycles this result might be explained by the gradual decrease of the reductive property of cnt after reuse 3 4 comparison to fe vi na2s2o3 system very recently the activation of fe vi by reducing agent na2s2o3 to enhance the oxidation of organic pollutants was reported at ph 8 feng et al 2018 in which the degradation efficiency of tmp by 100 μm fe vi increased from 10 without na2s2o3 to 100 with 12 5 μm na2s2o3 in 30 s this enhancement was ascribed to high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv originated from the reaction of na2s2o3 with fe vi feng et al 2018 interestingly it was noted that in the previous study of feng et al 2018 the experimental condition was always set at ph 8 to better understand the fe vi na2s2o3 system the degradation of 3 brp by 100 μm fe vi without and with 12 5 μm na2s2o3 was investigated in a wide ph range of 7 10 as presented in fig 8 the distinct enhancement was observed in fe vi na2s2o3 system at ph 7 and 8 in which the oxidation of 3 brp showed biphasic kinetics an initial instant 3 brp loss followed by a secondary slow decomposition phase for instance the degradation efficiency of 3 brp within 30 s increased from 3 with fe vi alone to 60 in fe vi na2s2o3 system at ph 8 while only 40 of 3 brp was degraded in the following 10 min in fe vi na2s2o3 system however negligible enhancement was observed under ph 9 and 10 fig 8 in addition the effect of na2s2o3 on degradation products of 3 brp by fe vi was also investigated compared to alone fe vi oxidation dibrominated phenoxyphenols and dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls were also detected in effluent by fe vi na2s2o3 system indicating that na2s2o3 could enhance the degradation of 3 brp but could not alleviate the risk of undesirable polybrominated products in aqueous solutions 4 conclusion this study is the first report on the activation of fe vi by cnt for the degradation of contaminants in water treatment according to the experimental data the following conclusions were drawn 1 fe vi could degrade brps over a wide ph range from 6 to 10 with apparent second order rate constants of 1 8 1850 m 1s 1 which was highly depended on ph and exhibited the highest value at ph near the mean of pka values of fe vi and brp 2 the undesirable dibrominated phenoxyphenols and dibrominated dihydroxylated biphenyls were formed via coupling reaction of brps radicals generated from fe vi oxidation through one electron transfer 3 cnt could accelerate the degradation of brps ppl and smx by fe vi which was attributed to the high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv generated from the reaction of fe vi with cnt 4 moreover cnt could absorb formed polybrominated products during fe vi oxidation and thereby alleviating the potential risks of polybrominated diphenyl products in effluent these results show great implications for comprehensive understanding the application of fe vi and cnt in degradation organic pollutants

18889,microorganism removal efficiencies in deep bed filters vary with time and depth in the filter bed as the filter collects particles improved knowledge of such dynamics is relevant for the design operation and microbial risk assessment of filtration processes for drinking water treatment here we report on a high resolution spatio temporal characterization of virus and bacteria removal in a pilot scale dual media filter operated in contact filtration mode microorganisms investigated were bacteriophage salmonella typhimurium 28b plaque assay n 154 frna phage ms2 plaque assay rt qpcr n 87 and e coli colilert 18 n 73 microscopic and macroscopic filtration models were used to investigate and characterize the removal dynamics results show that ripening breakthrough fronts for turbidity viruses and e coli migrated in a wave like manner across the depth of the filter virus removal improved continuously throughout the filter cycle and viruses broke through almost simultaneously with turbidity ripening for e coli took longer than ripening for turbidity but the bacteria broke through before turbidity breakthrough instantaneous log removal peaked at 3 2 3 0 and 4 5 for 28b ms2 and e coli respectively however true average log removal during the period of stable effluent turbidity was significantly lower at 2 5 2 3 and 3 6 respectively peak observed filter coefficients λ were higher than predicted by ideal filtration theory this study demonstrates the importance of carefully designed sampling regimes when characterizing microorganism removal efficiencies of deep bed filters graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water filtration virus dynamics modeling 1 introduction provision of hygienically safe drinking water is an essential part of public health protection across the world who 2011 waterborne microorganisms of concern include pathogenic viruses bacteria and protozoan parasites which may reach a point of consumption either by entering raw water sources and overcoming treatment barriers mac kenzie et al 1994 or by post treatment introduction into a distribution system nygård et al 2007 treatment barriers include dedicated disinfection processes as well as general particle separation processes hijnen and medema 2010 traditionally most larger water treatment plants employ some combination of coagulation and deep bed filtration for particle separation viruses may be relatively difficult to remove in particle separation processes hijnen and medema 2010 and some may be quite resistant to inactivation by disinfection e g thurston enriquez et al 2003 in fact enteric viruses have been found in finished drinking water on several occasions keswick et al 1984 rose et al 1986 payment and armon 1989 therefore in a multiple barrier approach to microbial water quality operational optimization and sound estimates of virus removal efficiencies of each unit process are needed virus removal during depth filtration and its relationship to effluent turbidity was recently identified as a knowledge gap in microbial risk assessment petterson and ashbolt 2016 and virus removal is the main focus of the research reported in the present paper since typical norwegian surface waters are low in turbidity but high in natural organic matter nom most plants are designed as direct filtration or contact filtration plants ødegaard et al 1999 2010 i e filtration without a preceding sedimentation step a coagulation filtration system that meets specific regulatory requirements mainly with respect to effluent turbidity color and residual coagulant content is recognized as a hygienic barrier in norwegian regulations and assumed to be capable of removing viruses bacteria and parasites by 3 3 and 2 log10 units respectively however other guidelines issued by the norwegian water industry association ødegaard et al 2014 partly modeled on the usepa surface water treatment rule usepa 2006 only credit direct filtration systems with a log removal capacity for viruses of 1 5 if effluent turbidity is 0 2 ntu or 2 if enhanced coagulation is used with effluent turbidity 0 1 ntu and color removal better than 70 a recent report eikebrokk 2012 in norway recommended that the virus removal efficiency of contact filtration processes in particular be investigated in greater detail the deep bed filtration process is inherently dynamic even if the influent water quality is stable filter performance varies with time and with depth in the filter bed as the filter collects particles adin and rebhun 1974 tien and ramaro 2007 although there is usually a prolonged period of stable effluent turbidity after ripening and before breakthrough the removal efficiency for individual particle types such as microorganisms may be more dynamic than turbidity removal e g clark et al 1992 characterizing these variations is important for determining optimal filter operation to minimize pathogen passage huck et al 2001 the filtration process is also periodic and discontinuous since regular backwashing is required to restore the particle removal capacity hence average removal efficiencies during filtration may be challenging to estimate or at worst insufficient for characterizing health risks since the temporal variation in pathogen concentrations may be needed for a proper quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra haas et al 2014 the dynamic characteristics of the process imply that frequent sampling is needed in order to capture the full variation and allow true average removal efficiencies to be computed 1 1 mean removal may also be obtained through continuous flow proportional sampling but this provides no information on temporal variation in removal efficiency however high resolution spatio temporal characterization of virus removal efficiency in deep bed filters has hardly been undertaken with most studies relying only on samples from the filter outlet at relatively coarse time intervals presumably this is partly due to the cost and labor intensive experiments that are needed for a detailed characterization obtaining more complete characterizations of the virus removal efficiency could lead to a better understanding of the virus removal dynamics which could subsequently inform qmra studies and decisions on the design and operation of deep bed filters tables s 1 and s 2 in the online supplementary material provide a summary of 25 previous studies on virus removal in deep bed filtration for drinking water where coagulation was employed at some point upstream of the filter in general adequate particle stabilization by coagulation is necessary for effective rapid filtration amirtharajah 1988 and very poor virus removal is observed in rapid deep bed filters if coagulation is not employed see e g huck et al 2001 hendricks et al 2006 the results in tables s 1 and s 2 vary significantly from almost no removal to more than 5 log removal while it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons for this variation in each case differences between virus species certainly may play a role and it is obvious that the operational conditions under which the results were obtained also varied significantly there seems to be a trend tables s 1 and s 2 hijnen and medema 2010 that removal efficiencies obtained from full scale studies are lower than those observed at pilot or bench scale workers who compared different filter configurations depth media filtration rates under otherwise similar conditions found only moderate differences in removal some workers investigated removal during ripening and or breakthrough periods and found prolonged ripening for viruses compared to turbidity robeck et al 1962 and reduced removal during these periods templeton et al 2007 templeton et al 2007 also suggested that the degree of virus particle association relevant for downstream disinfection processes may vary during a filter cycle with the exception of templeton et al 2007 who sampled mid cycle from the interface between anthracite and sand media none of the 25 studies sampled from multiple levels of the filter column the purpose of the present study was therefore to undertake a detailed high resolution experimental investigation of a pilot scale dual media contact filtration system with respect to virus removal throughout the entire filter column and the whole filtration cycle a tailor made automatic sampler was constructed to facilitate controlled consistent and simultaneous sampling from eight levels of the filtration column without significantly disturbing the system hydraulics and thereby filtration behavior two model bacteriophages salmonella typhimurium 28b and f specific bacteriophage ms2 were used while e coli was also included as a bacterial reference measures were taken to characterize potential aggregation effects and account for known virucidal inhibitory effects of the polyaluminium chloride coagulant kreiβel et al 2014 willumsen 2015 which otherwise may affect results significantly a sub goal of the project was to produce data that are suitable for fitting a dynamic filtration model through inverse modeling this work is ongoing a small subset of the data has already been published in a paper that compared the mid cycle removal efficiencies when using different coagulants christensen et al 2017 2 materials and

from the steel tank at a constant rate by feed pump p1 watson marlow 620u hose pump with 620re4 pump head and loadsure 12 mm tubing and entered the column through a pipe that was submerged except during the very early stages of the filter cycle the hydraulic head on the effluent side of the column was kept constant by a container with an overflow thus the filter was operated in constant rate rising head mode tap water was used for backwashing with the flow rate controlled manually with a tap the microorganism suspension hydrochloric acid hcl for ph adjustment and polyaluminium chloride pacl coagulant pax 18 kemira as were added to the 19 mm diameter main supply tube in tee fittings using peristaltic dosing pumps watson marlow 120u dv with 114dv pump head p2 p3 and p4 respectively the inline part of the tees consisted of a 7 cm long 6 mm diameter pipe section with a sudden contraction and expansion generating turbulence at the exit for rapid mixing of chemicals microorganisms effective mixing was observed when testing the mixer using a dye online turbidimeters wtw visoturb 700 iq were installed on both the influent and effluent sides of the column and calibrated for in pipe installation according to the manufacturer s instructions an online ph meter and temperature sensor wtw sensolyt 700 iq was installed on the effluent side in the overflow container eight online pressure transmitters h1 h8 impress imp lr 250 mbar were installed with non uniform spacing in order to focus data collection from the portions of the filter where the largest hydraulic gradients were expected to occur hydraulic head could also be visually inspected in eight standpipes a labview application national instruments usa communicating with sensors valves pumps through a micro controller was used for control monitoring and logging of recorded data ports for automated water sampling a h were installed directly opposite the ports for pressure monitoring a g and in the column outlet h ports a g contained a cylinder protruding about 15 mm into the filter media in order to minimize the influence of wall effects during sampling the automatic sampler consisted of an 8 channel peristaltic pump ismatec ism843a that directed samples into a refrigerated approximately 4 c insulated box the box contained a moving tube rack controlled by an optical sensor and electrical motor for sample collection and storage sampling tubes were cut to equal length and prior to each sampling event a volume corresponding to three full tube lengths would be drained to waste before actual sampling commenced this ensured that water in the tube from the previous sampling event was replaced by fresh water from the current sampling event the insulated box could take 12 sets of samples each consisting of eight 50 ml centrifuge tubes i e 96 samples in addition to the automated samples manual samples could be taken from locations m1 and m2 before and after addition of coagulant for assessment of possible aggregation and virucidal inhibitory effects of the coagulant as well as from the outlet m3 manual samples could be taken more frequently than the automatic samples and allowed better monitoring of the ripening and breakthrough periods samples could also be taken from the microorganism feed tank ft 2 2 microorganisms 2 2 1 salmonella typhimurium 28b salmonella typhimurium phage 28b lilleengen 1948 is a double stranded dna bacteriophage it has a head 50 nm with an octagonal outline which is attached to a smaller structure a base plate that extends approximately 10 nm from the head svenson et al 1979 the phage does not occur naturally in the environment and has been shown to be heat resistant sahlström et al 2008 in our experience stock suspensions can be kept for years at refrigeration temperatures without significantly loosing the titer phage 28b was included in this study for its relatively simple and robust propagation and enumeration protocol the phage was propagated and enumerated according to an unpublished protocol from the public health agency of sweden but essentially as described by höglund et al 2002 and equivalent to iso 10705 2 iso 1999 using its bacterial host strain salmonella enterica subsp enterica typhimurium type 5 the growth medium consisted of distilled water with nutrient broth 0 8 w v 105443 merck germany and yeast extract 0 05 w v 111926 merck germany for phage 28b propagation 0 25 ml of overnight bacterial host culture was transferred into 25 ml of fresh growth medium and incubated for 2 h at 37 c shaken a volume of stock 28b phage suspension was added to achieve a ratio of phage to host concentrations of 1 200 using known stock phage concentrations and an assumed host culture concentration of 2 108 cells ml from the unpublished protocol this mixture of phage and host was incubated shaken at 37 c for 10 12 min before diluting with 500 ml fresh growth medium the diluted suspension was incubated at 37 c shaken for 4 5 h after incubation 10 ml l of chloroform was added to kill and lyse the host cells the suspension was then centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the final concentration was determined to be 5 109 pfu ml plaque forming units ml phage 28b enumeration was performed as a double layer agar plaque assay similar to iso 10705 2 iso 1999 fresh bacterial host cultures were prepared by inoculating 25 ml of growth medium with 0 25 ml of existing host culture and incubating at 37 c shaken for 4 h host cultures were used for enumeration between 4 and 8 h after inoculation petri dishes with 20 ml solid bottom agar growth medium with 1 5 w v agar were prepared four ml molten top agar growth medium with 0 65 w v agar kept at about 50 c was mixed with 0 5 ml sample after serial dilution in 0 9 nacl when required and 0 5 ml exponential phase bacterial host culture and poured over the solid agar samples were incubated at 37 c for approximately 18 h and plaques were counted preliminary investigations willumsen 2015 revealed that titres of phage 28b sampled from point m1 before coagulant addition remained stable during a few days of storage while titres sampled samples from m2 and m3 after coagulant addition steadily decreased by up to 1 5 2 log10 units during one week figures s 3 and s 4 in the online supplementary material demonstrate this effect thus a slow virucidal and or aggregation effect of the coagulant appears to be present in order to reduce the impact of this effect all samples were analyzed promptly after sampling plated within 1 4 h for all samples not all dilutions could be plated in replicates due to the intense sampling regime but at least two plates were incubated for every sample two dilutions and or parallels of the same dilution figure s 6 in the online supplementary material shows uncertainty estimates for each sample 2 2 2 ms2 f specific bacteriophage ms2 is a 27 nm icosahedral single stranded rna virus strauss jr and sinsheimer 1963 it was included in this study since it is commonly used as a surrogate for pathogenic viruses when assessing the performance of water treatment processes as seen in tables s 1 and s 2 in the online supplementary material it was propagated according to iso 10705 1 iso 1995 against the host salmonella typhimurium wg49 nctc 12484 most ms2 enumerations were performed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr but a few samples were also enumerated using a plaque assay in order to assess the absolute number of viable ms2 viruses present and to provide a rough comparison of log removal values obtained from qpcr data previous studies matsui et al 2003 matsushita et al 2011 kreiβel et al 2014 as well as preliminary investigations for this study have shown that pacl coagulants tend to lower the concentrations of f specific phages like ms2 even at low doses as measured by a reduced infectivity in plaque assays kreiβel et al 2014 attributed the effect to interaction between ms2 surfaces and dissolved polymeric aluminum species al13 speculating that it prevents the phage host binding necessary for successful infection in order to decrease the impact of this effect in the present study the method of matsushita et al 2004 was performed prior to plaque assay a solution of beef extract be was prepared with 13 be powder 211520 becton dickinson and company usa and 5 n naoh was added to reach a target ph of 9 5 10 0 the be solution was kept at 4 c and used within three days all ms2 samples were diluted 10 fold with be and then stirred at 1500 rpm at 4 c for at least 5 h the plaque assay for ms2 was then performed on the treated samples as described by debartolomeis and cabelli 1991 using escherichia coli famp as the host the method has also been evaluated for water samples without pacl coagulants and it then usually shows 0 2 0 3 log10 units higher titres compared to untreated samples christensen and myrmel 2018 for rt qpcr viral rna was extracted from 140 μl water samples with the qiaamp viral rna mini kit and qiacube automated purification system according to the manufacturer s qiagen germany instructions with minor modifications the samples were stored in 560 μl lysis buffer at 80 c and were spiked after thawing with carrier rna 3 1 μg per sample prior to rna extraction rt qpcr was done with a stratagene ariamx real time pcr system agilent technologies usa an aliquot of 3 μl of the rna was added to 17 μl of the reaction mixture ultrasense one step quantitative rt pcr system

fluorescence reference and positive and negative no template controls were included on all plates aliquoted homologous rna was also included on each plate as an inter plate calibrator ipc baseline

individually so as to make the mean c q values quantification cycles for the ipcs equal while ensuring that all thresholds were in the exponential region of the amplification curves one of the plates included a 10 fold serial dilution series of homologous viral rna run in triplicate for determination of the amplification efficiency e e 88 7 r 2 99 8 which was assumed to be equal among plates under these conditions the ratio of concentrations c 2 c 1 in any two samples same or different plates indexed by 1 and 2 is given by the qpcr equation details in the online supplementary material 1 c 2 c 1 1 e c q 1 c q 2 the absolute amount of rna used for the ipcs and the serial dilution was not known but nor is it needed for calculating the ratios in 1 these ratios are all one needs to compute removal efficiencies as presented in section 3 figure s 7 in the online supplementary material shows uncertainty estimates for each sample preliminary experiments were performed to test for potential interference effects of the coagulant with the pcr assay distilled water was spiked with ms2 and coagulant and underwent rna extraction and rt qpcr analysis as described above no interference effects were observed for coagulant concentrations up to 10 mg l when compared with control samples without coagulant 2 2 3 escherichia coli e coli was also included in this study for comparison with the viruses and because it is a widely used faecal indicator bacterium edberg et al 2000 cultures were prepared by inoculating brain heart infusion broth 237500 becton dickinson and company usa with e coli ccug 17620 overnight cultures were centrifuged and washed twice with peptone saline diluent cm0733 oxoid united kingdom and stored at 4 c for a maximum of 5 days enumeration of e coli was performed using colilert 18 with quanti tray 2000 idexx laboratories usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the method is equivalent to a most probable number mpn method with two dilutions and 48 49 tubes at each dilution samples were analyzed using only one replicate due to time constraints figure s 8 in the online supplementary material shows uncertainty estimates for each sample 2 3 water quality analyses manual turbidity measurements including the samples from port a h were performed with a hach 2100n is benchtop turbidimeter according to the manufacturer s instructions due to time constraints most of these turbidity measurements had to be performed during the days following the experiment and were subject to changes due to storage for the effluent both continuously logged turbidity sensor t2 in fig 1 and manually measured turbidity samples from port h was available the difference in turbidity between samples from port h and logged values from sensor t2 was on average 0 055 sd 0 020 units assuming that this increase due to storage is relevant for all the manual turbidity measurements 0 055 ntu was subtracted from all the manual measurements for ports a h as a crude way of accounting for changes due to storage color and uv absorption measurements were done on spectrophotometer hach dr 3900 after filtering the samples through a 0 45 μm filter raw water alkalinity was determined by titration with hcl to ph 4 5 using the dosing pump and ph meter in the pilot plant raw water total organic carbon toc was measured by an external lab als laboratory group as norway according to ns en 1484 1997 the suspended solids content of the coagulated water was measured according to method ns en 872 2005 total residual aluminium concentration was determined during a test run using hach aluminon method 8012 adapted from standard methods no 3500 al apha awwa wef 2012 during the actual experiment dissolved aluminium was determined by an external lab noranalyse as norway using icp oes according to method ns en iso 11885 2009 all measurements mentioned in this paragraph were taken immediately after sampling except for suspended solids and the external lab analyses toc and one al analysis which were done a few days after the experiment 2 4 raw water quality and coagulant dose determination the raw water was collected from the river glomma on two occasions august 2014 and may 2015 and mixed in the storage tank at the university after some initial sedimentation turbidity remained stable in the storage tank as explained in section 2 1 a batch of raw water would be pumped into the lab prior to each filter run the measured raw water characteristics of the experimental batch are listed in table 3 figure s 5 in the online supplementary material shows raw water quality time series taken during the experiment the specific uv absorption suva is relatively high indicating that the nom of this water is rich in aromatic compounds and well suited to treatment by coagulation matilainen et al 2010 pax 18 kemira finland a 42 basicity polyaluminium chloride with an al content of 9 w v was chosen as the coagulant for this study as it is a commonly used coagulant in norway no filter aid was used hcl was used for ph adjustment prior to adding the coagulant the filtration rate was kept constant at 5 9 m h the coagulant dose and coagulation ph were determined by testing a range of doses and ph values in the pilot plant searching for the smallest dose and the best working ph at that dose that resulted in outlet turbidity values less than 0 2 ntu color less than 5 mg pt l and residual coagulant content 0 15 mg al l which are the main norwegian regulatory requirements for an al based coagulation filtration plant to be considered a hygienic barrier it was found that a coagulant dose of 1 5 mg al l and coagulation ph of 5 8 constituted an optimal dosing regime resulting in effluent turbidity of 0 03 0 04 ntu color 2 mg pt l and residual aluminium concentration of 0 031 mg al l during the optimization run subsequently a full filtration cycle with this dose showed that the cycle was terminated by turbidity breakthrough after approximately 15 h the dose and the filter run length are in rough agreement with empirical models developed by eikebrokk et al 2004 based on numerous pilot filter runs with low turbidity waters and a range of color values it should be noted that no microorganism suspension was added to the influent water during dose optimization thus the particle content and water chemistry may have changed during the actual experiment but no significant changes in the process could be observed specifically the effluent turbidity evolution during the experiment was close to that observed during the trial run described in the previous paragraph approximate net dilution factors for the addition of stock microorganism suspensions to the influent water were 1 26000 28b 1 6500 ms2 and 1 11000 e coli 2 5 experimental protocol prior to a filter run the column was backwashed for approximately 15 min at a rate of 50 60 m h resulting in a filter expansion of 50 60 the backwash rate was reduced gradually towards the end of the backwash in order to promote good separation of the two media but some interfacial mixing was still observed the system was then run with raw water for approximately 15 min in order to displace the tap water present in the filter from backwashing this was considered to give a more realistic initial condition since the tap water came from a different raw water source than the one used for the experiment and may also have contained some residual chlorine after 15 min of running raw water dosing of microorganisms hcl and coagulant was initiated simultaneously time cost and raw water availability meant that only a single filter run with high resolution sampling could be performed an overview of the sampling regime employed for this study is given in table s 4 in the online supplementary material samples were taken uniformly spaced in time except for samples from point m3 which were taken more frequently during the ripening and breakthrough periods a total of 160 water samples were taken during the filter cycle of which 154 were analyzed for 28b 9 by plaque assay for ms2 78 by rt qpcr for ms2 73 for e coli 119 for turbidity 9 for color and 1 for aluminum giving a total of 443 data points the automatic sampler was programmed to take samples with a total flow rate of 40 ml min 5 of the total flow rate through the column i e 5 ml min per sampling port 0 625 of the total flow rate this ensured that the water velocities through the sampling ports were lower than the pore water velocity reducing the risk of eroding the deposit by sampling induced shear forces the sample collection duration was 10 min in order to fill up the 50 ml centrifuge tubes in the automatic sampler and concentrations calculated from these samples should therefore be interpreted as 10 min averages as described in section 2 1 prior to each sampling event the sampler would drain the sampling tubes to replace water from the previous sampling event with fresh water from the column the draining would also last 10 min replacing the water in the tubes approximately three times using the same flow rate as during sampling the possibility of virus adsorption in the sampling tubes of the automatic sampler was assessed by pumping coagulated water containing viruses through one of the tubes and enumerating phage 28b before and after tube passage a reduction in phage concentration of 7 was observed although not statistically significant at the 95 level p 0 27 and considered acceptable section s 5 in the online supplementary material gives details on this statistical analysis 2 6 data presentation time points for all samples collected outside of the filter column online turbidity ph temp m1 m2 and m3 have been adjusted for the flow time in tubes pipes assuming plug flow time points for the automatic samples have been set to the midpoint of the 10 min sampling duration time zero corresponds to initial arrival of the coagulated water at the filter surface 3 experimental results with discussion 3 1 water quality water quality results are shown in table 4 and temporal variation where available is given in figure s 5 in the online supplementary material effluent ph decreased initially to reach a stable value of 5 9 6 0 after 2 3 h this initial decrease we suspect is due to a slightly ph raising effect of the top filtralite medium which subsides when the medium is covered with deposit fig 2 shows that online effluent turbidity reached a stable level after approximately 3 h and breakthrough started at approximately 14 2 h online inlet turbidity fig 2d in showed an increasing trend which we attribute to particles accumulating in the vertical pipe in which the sensor was installed the upwards flow velocity of 0 5 cm s was probably close to the terminal velocity of some of the influent particles true influent turbidity likely remained stable around the initial value of ca 2 05 ntu 3 2 spatio temporal removal no major differences in microorganism concentrations were found between sampling ports m1 before coagulant dosing and port m2 after coagulant dosing see fig 2 introduced below suggesting that neither microorganism aggregation nor inhibition effects from the coagulant were present to any appreciable extent between coagulant dosing and sample analysis mean influent concentrations c in of each organism were calculated from all m1 and m2 samples and are given in table 4 these were used to compute the passage probability π c c in for all sample ports where c is the concentration in the sample port the log removal is simply log 10 π fig 2 shows the results of all spatio temporal sampling for phage 28b 2a phage ms2 2b e coli 2c and turbidity 2d microorganism removal in fig 2 is presented in terms of log 10 π for visual clarity uncertainty estimates are not included in fig 2 these are instead shown in figures s 6 s 8 in the online supplementary material in general looking at the steepness of the curves fig 2 confirms that the 10 min sample collection time in the automatic sampler was relatively short compared to the time needed for changes in the local concentrations to occur i e the time averaging effect behind each datapoint is relatively small 3 2 1 salm typh 28b fig 2a clearly shows the existence of ripening and breakthrough fronts that migrated across the depth of the filter as the cycle progressed overall removal continued to improve until breakthrough of 28b after approximately 13 h slightly before turbidity breakthrough log removal remained higher than 2 5 for most of the cycle and peaked at about 3 2 it can be seen that at the time of the first auto sample breakthrough of 28b had already occurred at ports a b and c while the lower parts of the filter were still in a ripening phase fig 2a shows that after breakthrough in a given port the concentrations in that port increased before reaching a plateau at the end of the cycle there was still some removal occurring 1 3 log10 units mainly between ports b and c 0 4 log10 units and between port g and the outlet 0 5 log10 units sampling from multiple depths effectively allows a study of the impact of media configuration and filter depths in a single filter run the peak log removal in the upper layer filtralite as measured by port d was around 2 3 compared to the overall peak of 3 2 this is in agreement with previous research that found moderate effects of filter depths and media configurations on virus removal hijnen and medema 2010 harrington et al 2003 hendricks et al 2006 this may be explained by the fact that only a relatively small part of the filter is responsible for the majority of the removal at any given time since ripening occurs progressively across the depth of the filter however breakthrough in the filtralite medium occurred already after approximately 4 h thus while filter depth and media configurations may have a moderate effect on peak removal efficiencies a deeper filter may extend the useful operating period and decrease the number of breakthrough and initial ripening periods per unit time thereby improving the overall mean log removal there are some inconsistent results in fig 2a early in the cycle there is some removal between ports f and g but not between ports d and f which is inconsistent with the assertion that ripening occurs progressively with depth also the concentrations in the manual samples from the outlet m3 are above those from ports g and h early in the cycle we do not have a firm explanation for these results although the early g and h concentrations may have been underestimated because of high plaque counts on some petri dishes in general we trust the manual sampling data somewhat more than the auto sampler data 3 2 2 ms2 the sampling frequency for ms2 is lower than for 28b but the results for the auto samples are qualitatively similar fig 2b compared to 28b removal was slightly poorer for ms2 analyzed by rt qpcr more clearly seen in fig 3 introduced below and peaked at about 3 log10 units after 12 13 h data from plaque assays and rt qpcr are largely consistent with plaque assays apparently indicating a slightly better removal if this is really so it could be caused by some residual inhibitory effect of the coagulant even after the be treatment or possibly some non infectious pcr units that are more poorly removed than infectious ms2 however there is a mid cycle rise in outlet concentrations from rt qpcr that was not observed for the plaque assay or any of the other organisms while the data does not allow firm interpretations we may speculate that this could be related to a breakthrough in the upper part of the filter before sufficient ripening for ms2 has occurred in the lower parts of the filter 3 2 3 e coli the sampling frequency for e coli is also coarser than for 28b but ripening and breakthrough fronts can be observed here as well fig 2c note that all a samples and several b to g samples were above the enumeration limit for the colilert 18 method hence log 10 π is closer to zero for these samples than shown in fig 2c removal peaked at about 4 5 log 10 units but this occurred mid cycle after approximately 9 h and e coli removal had deteriorated significantly by the time of turbidity breakthrough 3 2 4 turbidity the turbidity data fig 2d from within the filter column displays a pattern similar to that of the 28b data at the time of the first auto sample breakthrough had already occurred at ports a b and c for ports d and e it is possible to discern a ripening phase but for the lower ports the noise drowns out the signal after breakthrough turbidity eventually stabilizes compared to the 28b data the rising parts of the curves after breakthrough are slightly steeper in the filtralite medium but less steep in the sand medium indicating slightly different dynamics of turbidity and virus removal in the two media the mechanistic interpretation of such a pattern is not presently clear to us 3 2 5 removal compared fig 3 shows the passage probability for all organisms in a single plot the two viruses behave quite similarly while e coli is both removed to a greater extent and shows faster ripening and earlier breakthrough than the viruses these observations are qualitatively consistent with earlier observations on the ripening and breakthrough behavior of differently sized particles clark et al 1992 kim and lawler 2008 moran et al 1993 although it should be emphasized that a variety of factors besides particle size may play a role in the observed relationships including variations in particle floc and media surface geometry and surface charge particle floc density etc the removal efficiencies of phages ms2 and 28b appear to be quite similar under these experimental conditions these are both nearly spherical viruses but 28b is about twice as large as ms2 towards the very end of the cycle the removal efficiencies appear to converge although we have no firm explanation for this latter observation one may speculate that removal mechanisms that are relatively independent of microorganism properties become more important at this stage since zeta potential measurements are not available for this experiment it is rather difficult to assess the influence of surface charge effects in controlling removal the isoelectric points iep of all three microorganisms are in the range 2 4 and they are therefore all negatively charged at the experimental ph but that is all that can be said without zeta potential data the iep of ms2 is usually reported as between 3 1 and 3 9 michen and graule 2010 the iep of 28b was reported recently as 3 8 christensen et al 2017 and the iep of e coli appears to be between 2 and 3 lytle et al 2002 the pattern with removal efficiencies for 28b ms2 e coli was also observed with zirconium a four valent metal and chitosan a natural organic polymer coagulants with similar raw water and optimized coagulation christensen et al 2017 3 2 6 mean removal evolution perhaps the most interesting analysis made possible by the high resolution data is the much refined computation of mean removal efficiency during the productive part of the filter cycle and the evolution of this mean removal as the filter cycle progresses let t 1 be the time when the filter is put into operation after a backwash event end of filter to waste then the mean probability of passage π m during the time interval from t 1 to t is given by 2 π m t t 1 t q τ c τ d τ t 1 t q τ c in τ d τ q const t 1 t c τ d τ t 1 t c in τ d τ where q is the filtration rate constant in our experiment using π c c in and the fact that c in was also constant in our experiment we have 3 π m t t 1 t π τ d τ t t 1 assuming that π t is differentiable it is readily verified that potential minima of π m t for t t 1 occur when 4 π m t π t which for a typical u shaped time evolution of π t has a unique solution thus if t 1 and π t is given termination of the filter run to minimize mean pathogen passage corresponds to ending the filter run at a time t t 2 that solves 4 the online supplementary material discusses optimal filter runs if we let both t 1 and t 2 be free to choose this is illustrated in fig 4 which shows π m t for viruses 4a and 4b and bacteria 4c for three values of t 1 corresponding to the events of turbidity falling below 0 2 and 0 1 ntu and turbidity becoming stable after approximately 3 h also shown is π t and the normalized cumulative passage ω from our experimental data defined as 5 ω t 0 t q τ c τ d τ 0 t stop q τ c τ d τ q c in const 0 t π τ d τ 0 t stop π τ d τ where t stop is the end time of the experimental run thus ω t gives the ratio of the number of microorganisms that has passed at time t to the total number of organisms that passed during the entire experimental run the curves in fig 4 were computed by direct trapezoidal integration of experimental data there are several points to note in fig 4 first the normalized cumulative passage curves ω t are quite different for viruses and bacteria approximately 40 50 of the virus passage happened in the early stages of the cycle before ripening brought effluent turbidity down to 0 2 ntu the equivalent figure for bacteria is only about 25 2 2 rough estimate since the peak in e coli concentrations were missed because samples were above the enumeration limit fig 2c after turbidity dropped below 0 2 ntu ω t is quite flat for bacteria while it continues to flatten for viruses reflecting different ripening behaviors consequently most of the bacterial passage happened towards the end of the cycle second the marked difference between the instantaneous π t and the mean π m t is apparent when starting water production at turbidity 0 2 ntu the difference is about 1 log unit at the time of microorganism breakthrough it is also clear that π m t varies somewhat depending on when the filter to waste period is terminated and the effect is particularly noticeable if one postpones the production start until turbidity is completely stable at 3 h usually not feasible once breakthrough has occurred the different π m t curves start to converge the overall mean log removal between 32 min turbidity dropped below 0 2 ntu and 14 2 h onset of turbidity breakthrough was computed as 2 5 2 3 and 3 6 for 28b ms2 and e coli respectively this is significantly lower than the corresponding peak log removal of 3 2 3 0 and 4 5 respectively but higher than the log credit values suggested by ødegaard et al 2014 1 5 2 0 for viruses and 2 25 2 5 for bacteria hijnen and medema 2010 in their review reported much lower mean removal efficiencies but their estimates included waste water studies and were also weighted strongly in favor of full scale studies the study that comes closest to our study in terms of raw water characteristics and experimental setup is the one by hendricks et al 2006 indexed 38 and 39 in tables s1 and s2 who reported a log removal for ms2 of 2 9 two hour mean obtained mid cycle huck et al 2001 indexed 34 in tables s 1 and s 2 also observed an increase in log removal efficiency for ms2 during end of run conditions before turbidity breakthrough 2 0 log10 units compared to mid cycle removal 1 4 log10 units their raw water was quite similar to the present study but coagulant doses were lower and they used a cationic polymer interestingly they observed much lower e coli mid cycle removal about 0 5 log10 units than the present study third it is interesting to compare the locations of minima in π t i e time of conventional breakthrough and minima in π m t i e the time of minimized organism passage for viruses breakthrough occurred slightly before turbidity breakthrough but the minimum of π m t for viruses occurred at ms2 or slightly after 28b turbidity breakthrough and 1 2 h after virus breakthrough the location of the minimum of π m t for viruses does not depend strongly on t 1 the start of the production period since the passage probability rises so quickly for viruses after breakthrough for bacteria the situation is different the minima of both π t and π m t occurred several hours before turbidity breakthrough the exact location of the minimum of π m t is more sensitive to t 1 since the passage probability of bacteria rises more slowly in the time right after breakthrough continuing water production until turbidity reaches 0 2 ntu was clearly more detrimental to mean bacteria passage than mean virus passage in this case since the overall increase in π t for bacteria is greater than for viruses it is clear that one cannot strictly optimize for mean bacteria and mean virus passage simultaneously for such a pattern but ending the filter cycle at 13 14 h was close to optimal for all microorganisms investigated fig 4d shows identical computations performed for the turbidity data with the caveat that concepts such as proportion of turbidity passed may not be entirely well defined for turbidity which is not a strictly conserved quantity nevertheless the panel indicates that a greater proportion of the effluent turbidity passage occurred during the period of stable operation i e less of the turbidity passage happened during ripening and breakthrough periods as compared to the microorganisms furthermore the minimum of π m t for turbidity occurred almost immediately after turbidity breakthrough and practically at the same location as for viruses 3 3 headloss fig 5 shows the michau diagram for the filter run which confirms that most of the headloss increase occurred in the upper part of the filtralite layer but there was also some headloss development in the upper part of the sand layer 4 interpretations in terms of filtration modeling classical macroscopic filtration models that describe the dynamic behavior of the filtration process consist essentially of a particle volume conservation equation and a constitutive filtration rate equation iwasaki 1937 herzig et al 1970 tien and ramaro 2007 respectively 6 σ t u c z 0 7 c z λ c here c is the suspended particle concentration volume of particles per unit volume of suspension dim less σ is the specific deposit volume of particles per unit volume of porous medium dim less u is the darcy velocity l t and λ is the filter coefficient 1 l the former equation assumes that dispersive transport is negligible as well as other simplifying approximations horner et al 1986 the latter was first proposed by iwasaki 1937 and remains a standard assumption the system above does not consider particle detachment which may be a limitation the main challenge in deep bed filtration is that λ changes with time as the filter collects particles and it also changes with depth in the filter thus λ is usually taken as a function of σ and is called the filtration function work is ongoing to investigate if there exist appropriate filtration functions for this dataset in the following we rely directly on the data rather than simulation results 4 1 experimental filter coefficients here crude estimates of the mean filter coefficient in each layer were determined directly from the experimental data by computing 8 λ i i 1 1 z i 1 z i ln c i c i 1 where c i is the concentration turbidity in port i and c i 1 is the concentration in the nearest port below both at a given time fig 6 shows the results along with the hydraulic gradients for each layer the data are noisy since we are essentially estimating derivatives based on two data points that are both a little noisy but the wave like progression across the filter depth of the peak in λ can clearly be seen the highest filter coefficients occurred in the upper part of the sand layer which was partly mixed with filtralite after backwashing note the lower temporal sampling resolution of the ms2 e coli data which masks some of their dynamics note also that the distance between sample ports varied so that one may expect that some peaks are averaged down as one moves to the rightmost panels in fig 6 the hydraulic gradient in the lower part of the sand layer started to rise after about 12 h thereby giving an early warning that turbidity breakthrough was imminent the gradient increased some 30 fold in the upper part of the filtralite and there is a variation in initial hydraulic gradients between the various sand layers another indication that there was some mixing of sand and filtralite 4 2 comparison with ideal filtration theory the filter coefficients in fig 6 may be compared to those estimated from ideal filtration theory assuming that near steady state conditions prevail during each 10 min sampling interval substantial research has been devoted to estimating λ from first principles and has been largely successful under favorable conditions for filtration i e no repulsive electrostatic interactions between particles and filter grains tufenkji 2007 in this theory the filter coefficient is given by 9 λ 3 2 1 ε d c α η 0 here ε is the porosity d c is the filter grain collector diameter η 0 is the so called single collector contact efficiency and α the sticking efficiency the latter is assumed to be 1 under favorable conditions the currently most widely used equation for estimating η 0 was developed by tufenkji and elimelech 2004 fig 7 compares peak values of λ taken from fig 6 with those predicted by equation 9 using the expression for η 0 from tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the uncertainty intervals for observed λ values were computed using 95 confidence intervals for concentrations see figures s 6 s 8 in the online supplementary material in equation 9 α was taken as 1 assuming that sufficient coagulation and ripening for favorable conditions had occurred at the time of peak removal for size graded porous media as our filter media it has been recommended to compute η 0 and λ using a grain size that emphasizes the smaller grain fractions such as d 10 pazmino et al 2011 hence we followed this recommendation in order to account for uncertainty in the input parameters to the calculation of η 0 the grey bands in fig 7 show a range of λ values corresponding to a very wide range in the input parameter values assumed to cover all plausible values applicable to our experiment see the figure caption even accounting for the effect of the already retained particles o melia and ali 1979 from fig 7 it is seen that the observed peak λ values are outside the grey bands except for ms2 barely indicating that observed peak λ values were largely inconsistent with those computed from colloid filtration theory based on known microorganism sizes thus even assuming perfectly favorable filtration conditions α 1 and allowing for a wide range of input parameters peak observed removal were higher than predicted by filtration theory possible explanations include departures from the ideal assumptions of filtration theory e g the effect of the pore space being partly filled with deposit and microorganism floc association 4 3 deposit distribution at end of cycle fig 8 shows the results of a simple numerical trapezoidal integration of equation 6 directly from the experimental data for c and indicates how the deposit of particles c for particles assumed proportional to turbidity and 28b was distributed in the filter column at the end of the experiment most of the deposit is in the upper part of the filtralite for both particles and 28b but there is also a noticeable accumulation of deposit in the upper part of the sand layer there is also some non monotonicity within each filter medium 5 overall discussion our results were obtained in a single filter run under a single set of conditions and as such generalizations from our computed removal efficiencies should be done with care the filtration performance may be affected by a range of factors such as e g raw water quality coagulant type and dose use of filter aids filtration rate backwash strategies etc hijnen and medema 2010 in particular our raw water was relatively high in nom and low in turbidity whereas in many places the opposite situation with low nom and high turbidity is more common high nom and low turbidity usually requires higher coagulant doses and stricter ph control edzwald and tobiason 1999 there was no direct confirmation by e g zeta potential measurements that coagulation conditions were optimal in our experiment as mentioned in the introduction effective filtration depends on adequate coagulation for parasites it has been demonstrated that removal may be sensitive to suboptimal coagulation conditions huck et al 2001 2002 still this study demonstrates how dynamic the filter performance may be for viruses and bacteria and what analyses can be performed when high resolution data is available the dynamic microorganism removal observed in this study even during the period of stable effluent turbidity signals that care should be taken when characterizing microbial removal efficiencies during filtration either samples should be taken frequently such as in this study or at least flow proportional continuous sampling should be employed to better estimate true mean removal efficiencies the usefulness of surrogates such as phages for studying removal and inactivation of pathogenic viruses is a continuous concern mesquita and emelko 2012 sinclair et al 2012 recent research shi and tarabara 2018 also suggests that laboratory preparation methods propagation purification for viruses may affect their charge and size distributions as well as hydrophobicity hijnen and medema 2010 suggested that coliphages are appropriate surrogates for pathogenic viruses in deep bed filtration since salmonella typhimurium phage 28b is simple to work with it would be a useful addition to the set of surrogate phages if it can be confirmed that it behaves similarly to ms2 and or other coliphages under a wide range of conditions we believe this study and christensen et al 2017 are the first to use this phage for deep bed filtration experiments for drinking water examples of previous applications include waste water transport in soils carlander et al 2000 small scale waste water treatment systems heistad et al 2009a b and biofilter performance in drinking water treatment persson et al 2005 a concern regarding the applicability of these results and those from most other pilot scale studies is the high influent concentrations used for the microorganisms much higher than what occurs naturally assavasilavasukul et al 2008 observed better removal of cryptosporidium during conventional treatment with higher cryptosporidium influent concentrations prasanthi et al 1997 also observed better removal with higher influent concentrations in laboratory columns without coagulation however it is not clear whether these results apply to viruses in our experiment the virus volume is negligible compared to the total floc volume virus aggregation was not detected and according to standard flocculation theory the virus floc aggregation rate is expected to scale linearly with virus concentrations and thus variations in virus concentrations shouldn t affect removal efficiencies further research is needed to clarify these issues finally the role of virus detachment is also not clear kim and tobiason 2004 if virus detachment is not negligible compared to virus attachment the number of viruses available for detachment becomes important and therefore the observed removal efficiencies may become a function of the influent concentrations the concentrations of all three microorganisms in the influent were chosen sufficiently high that there was no need for dedicated concentration steps during enumeration even for effluent samples taken during peak removal issues associated with analytical recoveries were therefore largely avoided although there may still have been some losses to glassware and plastics pipettes tubes used in the lab these losses are however difficult to assess since all the removal efficiencies are calculated from the ratio of two concentrations losses that are proportional to concentrations would not affect these removal values except for added noise 6 conclusions the following conclusions may be drawn from this work 1 both virus and e coli filtration performance was dynamic showing variations in removal efficiencies during periods of stable effluent turbidity ripening and breakthrough for e coli occurred earlier than for viruses both deviated from turbidity regulatory limits on turbidity typically less than 0 2 ntu appear not to ensure stable operation with respect to virus e coli removal 2 true mean log removal estimates over complete cycles of water production deviated significantly from instantaneous log removal values careful design of sampling regimes is needed to correctly estimate mean removal efficiencies in filtration experiments reporting the removal efficiency of a deep bed filter with a single number may be inappropriate unless the single number is a properly computed mean removal efficiency 3 peak removal of viruses and bacteria between adjacent sampling ports were higher than computed with ideal filtration theory 4 more high resolution studies of microbial filtration performance should be performed in order to collect data under a wider range of conditions we recommend that future studies present results in a manner similar to fig 4 with an axis for total filtered water depth to facilitate comparison between different filter and operational configurations we emphasize again that the main purpose of this study was to generate a high resolution both in space and time mapping of the removal performance throughout a filter cycle mainly with respect to viruses to our knowledge this is the first such high resolution mapping while it would have been desirable to have multiple runs to assess variability between runs and experimental conditions this is a very resource intensive type of investigation which meant that we only saw it possible to run one cycle the main result is that we could demonstrate the impact of time variation on the calculation of mean removal efficiencies while the pattern of time variation may vary between settings or even with aging we believe our study demonstrates the importance of capturing it and accounting for it declaration

18889,microorganism removal efficiencies in deep bed filters vary with time and depth in the filter bed as the filter collects particles improved knowledge of such dynamics is relevant for the design operation and microbial risk assessment of filtration processes for drinking water treatment here we report on a high resolution spatio temporal characterization of virus and bacteria removal in a pilot scale dual media filter operated in contact filtration mode microorganisms investigated were bacteriophage salmonella typhimurium 28b plaque assay n 154 frna phage ms2 plaque assay rt qpcr n 87 and e coli colilert 18 n 73 microscopic and macroscopic filtration models were used to investigate and characterize the removal dynamics results show that ripening breakthrough fronts for turbidity viruses and e coli migrated in a wave like manner across the depth of the filter virus removal improved continuously throughout the filter cycle and viruses broke through almost simultaneously with turbidity ripening for e coli took longer than ripening for turbidity but the bacteria broke through before turbidity breakthrough instantaneous log removal peaked at 3 2 3 0 and 4 5 for 28b ms2 and e coli respectively however true average log removal during the period of stable effluent turbidity was significantly lower at 2 5 2 3 and 3 6 respectively peak observed filter coefficients λ were higher than predicted by ideal filtration theory this study demonstrates the importance of carefully designed sampling regimes when characterizing microorganism removal efficiencies of deep bed filters graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water filtration virus dynamics modeling 1 introduction provision of hygienically safe drinking water is an essential part of public health protection across the world who 2011 waterborne microorganisms of concern include pathogenic viruses bacteria and protozoan parasites which may reach a point of consumption either by entering raw water sources and overcoming treatment barriers mac kenzie et al 1994 or by post treatment introduction into a distribution system nygård et al 2007 treatment barriers include dedicated disinfection processes as well as general particle separation processes hijnen and medema 2010 traditionally most larger water treatment plants employ some combination of coagulation and deep bed filtration for particle separation viruses may be relatively difficult to remove in particle separation processes hijnen and medema 2010 and some may be quite resistant to inactivation by disinfection e g thurston enriquez et al 2003 in fact enteric viruses have been found in finished drinking water on several occasions keswick et al 1984 rose et al 1986 payment and armon 1989 therefore in a multiple barrier approach to microbial water quality operational optimization and sound estimates of virus removal efficiencies of each unit process are needed virus removal during depth filtration and its relationship to effluent turbidity was recently identified as a knowledge gap in microbial risk assessment petterson and ashbolt 2016 and virus removal is the main focus of the research reported in the present paper since typical norwegian surface waters are low in turbidity but high in natural organic matter nom most plants are designed as direct filtration or contact filtration plants ødegaard et al 1999 2010 i e filtration without a preceding sedimentation step a coagulation filtration system that meets specific regulatory requirements mainly with respect to effluent turbidity color and residual coagulant content is recognized as a hygienic barrier in norwegian regulations and assumed to be capable of removing viruses bacteria and parasites by 3 3 and 2 log10 units respectively however other guidelines issued by the norwegian water industry association ødegaard et al 2014 partly modeled on the usepa surface water treatment rule usepa 2006 only credit direct filtration systems with a log removal capacity for viruses of 1 5 if effluent turbidity is 0 2 ntu or 2 if enhanced coagulation is used with effluent turbidity 0 1 ntu and color removal better than 70 a recent report eikebrokk 2012 in norway recommended that the virus removal efficiency of contact filtration processes in particular be investigated in greater detail the deep bed filtration process is inherently dynamic even if the influent water quality is stable filter performance varies with time and with depth in the filter bed as the filter collects particles adin and rebhun 1974 tien and ramaro 2007 although there is usually a prolonged period of stable effluent turbidity after ripening and before breakthrough the removal efficiency for individual particle types such as microorganisms may be more dynamic than turbidity removal e g clark et al 1992 characterizing these variations is important for determining optimal filter operation to minimize pathogen passage huck et al 2001 the filtration process is also periodic and discontinuous since regular backwashing is required to restore the particle removal capacity hence average removal efficiencies during filtration may be challenging to estimate or at worst insufficient for characterizing health risks since the temporal variation in pathogen concentrations may be needed for a proper quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra haas et al 2014 the dynamic characteristics of the process imply that frequent sampling is needed in order to capture the full variation and allow true average removal efficiencies to be computed 1 1 mean removal may also be obtained through continuous flow proportional sampling but this provides no information on temporal variation in removal efficiency however high resolution spatio temporal characterization of virus removal efficiency in deep bed filters has hardly been undertaken with most studies relying only on samples from the filter outlet at relatively coarse time intervals presumably this is partly due to the cost and labor intensive experiments that are needed for a detailed characterization obtaining more complete characterizations of the virus removal efficiency could lead to a better understanding of the virus removal dynamics which could subsequently inform qmra studies and decisions on the design and operation of deep bed filters tables s 1 and s 2 in the online supplementary material provide a summary of 25 previous studies on virus removal in deep bed filtration for drinking water where coagulation was employed at some point upstream of the filter in general adequate particle stabilization by coagulation is necessary for effective rapid filtration amirtharajah 1988 and very poor virus removal is observed in rapid deep bed filters if coagulation is not employed see e g huck et al 2001 hendricks et al 2006 the results in tables s 1 and s 2 vary significantly from almost no removal to more than 5 log removal while it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons for this variation in each case differences between virus species certainly may play a role and it is obvious that the operational conditions under which the results were obtained also varied significantly there seems to be a trend tables s 1 and s 2 hijnen and medema 2010 that removal efficiencies obtained from full scale studies are lower than those observed at pilot or bench scale workers who compared different filter configurations depth media filtration rates under otherwise similar conditions found only moderate differences in removal some workers investigated removal during ripening and or breakthrough periods and found prolonged ripening for viruses compared to turbidity robeck et al 1962 and reduced removal during these periods templeton et al 2007 templeton et al 2007 also suggested that the degree of virus particle association relevant for downstream disinfection processes may vary during a filter cycle with the exception of templeton et al 2007 who sampled mid cycle from the interface between anthracite and sand media none of the 25 studies sampled from multiple levels of the filter column the purpose of the present study was therefore to undertake a detailed high resolution experimental investigation of a pilot scale dual media contact filtration system with respect to virus removal throughout the entire filter column and the whole filtration cycle a tailor made automatic sampler was constructed to facilitate controlled consistent and simultaneous sampling from eight levels of the filtration column without significantly disturbing the system hydraulics and thereby filtration behavior two model bacteriophages salmonella typhimurium 28b and f specific bacteriophage ms2 were used while e coli was also included as a bacterial reference measures were taken to characterize potential aggregation effects and account for known virucidal inhibitory effects of the polyaluminium chloride coagulant kreiβel et al 2014 willumsen 2015 which otherwise may affect results significantly a sub goal of the project was to produce data that are suitable for fitting a dynamic filtration model through inverse modeling this work is ongoing a small subset of the data has already been published in a paper that compared the mid cycle removal efficiencies when using different coagulants christensen et al 2017 2 materials and experimental methods 2 1 pilot plant design an overview of the pilot plant is given in fig 1 the filter column was made from a transparent pvc cylinder with 10 cm inner diameter a 10 cm deep support layer with size graded gravel covered the outlet a tapered plastic cone with slits the bottom filter medium consisted of 50 cm of 0 4 0 8 mm silica sand rådasand ab sweden the top filter medium consisted of 79 cm of 0 8 1 6 mm expanded clay aggregates filtralite nc normal density crushed weber saint gobain norway filtralite has been shown to produce similar filtrate quality as anthracite but with slightly slower headloss development eikebrokk and saltnes 2001 the physical characteristics of the filter media as specified by the manufacturers are given in table 1 the ratio of column diameter to effective grain size was greater than 50 the recommended minimum ratio to minimize wall effects mehta and hawley 1969 lang et al 1993 raw water was stored in a 30 m3 underground tank equipped with a circulation pump prior to a filter run a batch of raw water was pumped from the underground tank into a smaller steel tank 1 8 m3 with a paddle stirrer in the laboratory water was fed from the steel tank at a constant rate by feed pump p1 watson marlow 620u hose pump with 620re4 pump head and loadsure 12 mm tubing and entered the column through a pipe that was submerged except during the very early stages of the filter cycle the hydraulic head on the effluent side of the column was kept constant by a container with an overflow thus the filter was operated in constant rate rising head mode tap water was used for backwashing with the flow rate controlled manually with a tap the microorganism suspension hydrochloric acid hcl for ph adjustment and polyaluminium chloride pacl coagulant pax 18 kemira as were added to the 19 mm diameter main supply tube in tee fittings using peristaltic dosing pumps watson marlow 120u dv with 114dv pump head p2 p3 and p4 respectively the inline part of the tees consisted of a 7 cm long 6 mm diameter pipe section with a sudden contraction and expansion generating turbulence at the exit for rapid mixing of chemicals microorganisms effective mixing was observed when testing the mixer using a dye online turbidimeters wtw visoturb 700 iq were installed on both the influent and effluent sides of the column and calibrated for in pipe installation according to the manufacturer s instructions an online ph meter and temperature sensor wtw sensolyt 700 iq was installed on the effluent side in the overflow container eight online pressure transmitters h1 h8 impress imp lr 250 mbar were installed with non uniform spacing in order to focus data collection from the portions of the filter where the largest hydraulic gradients were expected to occur hydraulic head could also be visually inspected in eight standpipes a labview application national instruments usa communicating with sensors valves pumps through a micro controller was used for control monitoring and logging of recorded data ports for automated water sampling a h were installed directly opposite the ports for pressure monitoring a g and in the column outlet h ports a g contained a cylinder protruding about 15 mm into the filter media in order to minimize the influence of wall effects during sampling the automatic sampler consisted of an 8 channel peristaltic pump ismatec ism843a that directed samples into a refrigerated approximately 4 c insulated box the box contained a moving tube rack controlled by an optical sensor and electrical motor for sample collection and storage sampling tubes were cut to equal length and prior to each sampling event a volume corresponding to three full tube lengths would be drained to waste before actual sampling commenced this ensured that water in the tube from the previous sampling event was replaced by fresh water from the current sampling event the insulated box could take 12 sets of samples each consisting of eight 50 ml centrifuge tubes i e 96 samples in addition to the automated samples manual samples could be taken from locations m1 and m2 before and after addition of coagulant for assessment of possible aggregation and virucidal inhibitory effects of the coagulant as well as from the outlet m3 manual samples could be taken more frequently than the automatic samples and allowed better monitoring of the ripening and breakthrough periods samples could also be taken from the microorganism feed tank ft 2 2 microorganisms 2 2 1 salmonella typhimurium 28b salmonella typhimurium phage 28b lilleengen 1948 is a double stranded dna bacteriophage it has a head 50 nm with an octagonal outline which is attached to a smaller structure a base plate that extends approximately 10 nm from the head svenson et al 1979 the phage does not occur naturally in the environment and has been shown to be heat resistant sahlström et al 2008 in our experience stock suspensions can be kept for years at refrigeration temperatures without significantly loosing the titer phage 28b was included in this study for its relatively simple and robust propagation and enumeration protocol the phage was propagated and enumerated according to an unpublished protocol from the public health agency of sweden but essentially as described by höglund et al 2002 and equivalent to iso 10705 2 iso 1999 using its bacterial host strain salmonella enterica subsp enterica typhimurium type 5 the growth medium consisted of distilled water with nutrient broth 0 8 w v 105443 merck germany and yeast extract 0 05 w v 111926 merck germany for phage 28b propagation 0 25 ml of overnight bacterial host culture was transferred into 25 ml of fresh growth medium and incubated for 2 h at 37 c shaken a volume of stock 28b phage suspension was added to achieve a ratio of phage to host concentrations of 1 200 using known stock phage concentrations and an assumed host culture concentration of 2 108 cells ml from the unpublished protocol this mixture of phage and host was incubated shaken at 37 c for 10 12 min before diluting with 500 ml fresh growth medium the diluted suspension was incubated at 37 c shaken for 4 5 h after incubation 10 ml l of chloroform was added to kill and lyse the host cells the suspension was then centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the final concentration was determined to be 5 109 pfu ml plaque forming units ml phage 28b enumeration was performed as a double layer agar plaque assay similar to iso 10705 2 iso 1999 fresh bacterial host cultures were prepared by inoculating 25 ml of growth medium with 0 25 ml of existing host culture and incubating at 37 c shaken for 4 h host cultures were used for enumeration between 4 and 8 h after inoculation petri dishes with 20 ml solid bottom agar growth medium with 1 5 w v agar were prepared four ml molten top agar growth medium with 0 65 w v agar kept at about 50 c was mixed with 0 5 ml sample after serial dilution in 0 9 nacl when required and 0 5 ml exponential phase bacterial host culture and poured over the solid agar samples were incubated at 37 c for approximately 18 h and plaques were counted preliminary investigations willumsen 2015 revealed that titres of phage 28b sampled from point m1 before coagulant addition remained stable during a few days of storage while titres sampled samples from m2 and m3 after coagulant addition steadily decreased by up to 1 5 2 log10 units during one week figures s 3 and s 4 in the online supplementary material demonstrate this effect thus a slow virucidal and or aggregation effect of the coagulant appears to be present in order to reduce the impact of this effect all samples were analyzed promptly after sampling plated within 1 4 h for all samples not all dilutions could be plated in replicates due to the intense sampling regime but at least two plates were incubated for every sample two dilutions and or parallels of the same dilution figure s 6 in the online supplementary material shows uncertainty estimates for each sample 2 2 2 ms2 f specific bacteriophage ms2 is a 27 nm icosahedral single stranded rna virus strauss jr and sinsheimer 1963 it was included in this study since it is commonly used as a surrogate for pathogenic viruses when assessing the performance of water treatment processes as seen in tables s 1 and s 2 in the online supplementary material it was propagated according to iso 10705 1 iso 1995 against the host salmonella typhimurium wg49 nctc 12484 most ms2 enumerations were performed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr but a few samples were also enumerated using a plaque assay in order to assess the absolute number of viable ms2 viruses present and to provide a rough comparison of log removal values obtained from qpcr data previous studies matsui et al 2003 matsushita et al 2011 kreiβel et al 2014 as well as preliminary investigations for this study have shown that pacl coagulants tend to lower the concentrations of f specific phages like ms2 even at low doses as measured by a reduced infectivity in plaque assays kreiβel et al 2014 attributed the effect to interaction between ms2 surfaces and dissolved polymeric aluminum species al13 speculating that it prevents the phage host binding necessary for successful infection in order to decrease the impact of this effect in the present study the method of matsushita et al 2004 was performed prior to plaque assay a solution of beef extract be was prepared with 13 be powder 211520 becton dickinson and company usa and 5 n naoh was added to reach a target ph of 9 5 10 0 the be solution was kept at 4 c and used within three days all ms2 samples were diluted 10 fold with be and then stirred at 1500 rpm at 4 c for at least 5 h the plaque assay for ms2 was then performed on the treated samples as described by debartolomeis and cabelli 1991 using escherichia coli famp as the host the method has also been evaluated for water samples without pacl coagulants and it then usually shows 0 2 0 3 log10 units higher titres compared to untreated samples christensen and myrmel 2018 for rt qpcr viral rna was extracted from 140 μl water samples with the qiaamp viral rna mini kit and qiacube automated purification system according to the manufacturer s qiagen

individually so as to make the mean c q values quantification cycles for the ipcs equal while ensuring that all thresholds were in the exponential region of the amplification curves one of the plates included a 10 fold serial dilution series of homologous viral rna run in triplicate for determination of the amplification efficiency e e 88 7 r 2 99 8 which was assumed to be equal among plates under these conditions the ratio of concentrations c 2 c 1 in any two samples same or different plates indexed by 1 and 2 is given by the qpcr equation details in the online supplementary material 1 c 2 c 1

removal efficiencies as presented in section 3 figure s 7 in the online supplementary material shows uncertainty estimates for each sample preliminary experiments were performed to test for potential interference effects of the coagulant with the pcr assay distilled water was spiked with ms2 and coagulant and underwent rna extraction and rt qpcr analysis as described above no interference effects were observed for coagulant concentrations up to 10 mg l when compared with control samples without coagulant 2 2 3 escherichia coli e coli was also included in this study for comparison with the viruses and because it is a widely used faecal indicator bacterium edberg et al 2000 cultures were prepared by inoculating brain heart infusion broth 237500 becton dickinson and company usa with e coli ccug 17620 overnight cultures were centrifuged and washed twice with peptone saline diluent cm0733 oxoid united kingdom and stored at 4 c for a maximum of 5 days enumeration of e coli was performed using colilert 18 with quanti tray 2000 idexx laboratories usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the method is equivalent to a most probable number mpn method with two dilutions and 48 49 tubes at each dilution samples were analyzed using only one replicate due to time constraints figure s 8 in the online supplementary material shows uncertainty estimates for each sample 2 3 water quality analyses manual turbidity measurements including the samples from port a h were performed with a hach 2100n is benchtop turbidimeter according to the manufacturer s instructions due to time constraints most of these turbidity measurements had to be performed during the days following the experiment and were subject to changes due to storage for the effluent both continuously logged turbidity sensor t2 in fig 1 and manually measured turbidity samples from port h was available the difference in turbidity between samples from port h and logged values from sensor t2 was on average 0

and one al analysis which were done a few days after the experiment 2 4 raw water quality and coagulant dose determination the raw water was collected from the river glomma on two occasions august 2014 and may 2015 and mixed in the storage tank at the university after some initial sedimentation turbidity remained stable in the storage tank as explained in section 2 1 a batch of raw water would be pumped into the lab prior to each filter run the measured raw water characteristics of the experimental batch are listed in table 3 figure s 5 in the online supplementary material shows raw water quality time series taken during the experiment the specific uv absorption suva is relatively high indicating that the nom of this water is rich in aromatic compounds and well suited to treatment by coagulation matilainen et al 2010 pax 18 kemira finland a 42 basicity polyaluminium chloride with an al content of 9 w v was chosen as the coagulant for this study as it is a commonly used coagulant in norway no filter aid was used hcl was used for ph adjustment prior to adding the coagulant the filtration rate was kept constant at 5 9 m h the coagulant dose and coagulation ph were determined by testing a range of doses and ph values in the pilot plant searching for the smallest dose and the best working ph at that dose that resulted in outlet turbidity values less than 0 2 ntu color less than 5 mg pt l and residual coagulant content 0 15 mg al l which are the main norwegian regulatory requirements for an al based coagulation filtration plant to be considered a hygienic barrier it was found that a coagulant dose of 1 5 mg al l and coagulation ph of 5 8 constituted an optimal dosing regime resulting in effluent turbidity of 0 03 0 04 ntu color 2 mg pt l and residual aluminium concentration of 0 031 mg al l during the optimization run subsequently a full filtration cycle with this dose showed that the cycle was terminated by turbidity breakthrough after approximately 15 h the dose and the filter run length are in rough agreement with empirical models developed by eikebrokk et al 2004 based on numerous pilot filter runs with low turbidity waters and a range of color values it should be noted that no microorganism suspension was added to the influent water during dose optimization thus the particle content and water chemistry may have changed during the actual experiment but no significant changes in the process could be observed specifically the effluent turbidity evolution during the experiment was close to that observed during the trial run described in the previous paragraph approximate net dilution factors for the addition of stock microorganism suspensions to the influent water were 1 26000 28b 1 6500 ms2 and 1 11000 e coli 2 5 experimental protocol prior to a filter run the column was backwashed for approximately 15 min at a rate of 50 60 m h resulting in a filter expansion of 50 60 the backwash rate was reduced gradually towards the end of the backwash in order to promote good separation of the two media but some interfacial mixing was still observed the system was then run with raw water for approximately 15 min in order to displace the tap water present in the filter from backwashing this was considered to give a more realistic initial condition since the tap water came from a different raw water source than the one used for the experiment and may also have contained some residual chlorine after 15 min of running raw water dosing of microorganisms hcl and coagulant was initiated simultaneously time cost and raw water availability meant that only a single filter run with high resolution sampling could be performed an overview of the sampling regime employed for this study is given in table s 4 in the online supplementary material samples were taken uniformly spaced in time except for samples from point m3 which were taken more frequently during the ripening and breakthrough periods a total of 160 water samples were taken during the filter cycle of which 154 were analyzed for 28b 9 by plaque assay for ms2 78 by rt qpcr for ms2 73 for e coli 119 for turbidity 9 for color and 1 for aluminum giving a total of 443 data points the automatic sampler was programmed to take samples with a total flow rate of 40 ml min 5 of the total flow rate through the column i e 5 ml min per sampling port 0 625 of the total flow rate this ensured that the water velocities through the sampling ports were lower than the pore water velocity reducing the risk of eroding the deposit by sampling induced shear forces the sample collection duration was 10 min in order to fill up the 50 ml centrifuge tubes in the automatic sampler and concentrations calculated from these samples should therefore be interpreted as 10 min averages as described in section 2 1 prior to each sampling event the sampler would drain the sampling tubes to replace water from the previous sampling event with fresh water from the column the draining would also last 10 min replacing the water in the tubes approximately three times using the same flow rate as during sampling the possibility of virus adsorption in the sampling tubes of the automatic sampler was assessed by pumping coagulated water containing viruses through one of the tubes and enumerating phage 28b before and after tube passage a reduction in phage concentration of 7 was observed although not statistically significant at the 95 level p 0 27 and considered acceptable section s 5 in the online supplementary material gives details on this statistical analysis 2 6 data presentation time points for all samples collected outside of the filter column online turbidity ph temp m1 m2 and m3 have been adjusted for the flow time in tubes pipes assuming plug flow time points for the automatic samples have been set to the midpoint of the 10 min sampling duration time zero corresponds to initial arrival of the coagulated water at the filter surface 3 experimental results with discussion 3 1 water quality water quality results are shown in table 4 and temporal variation where available is given in figure s 5 in the online supplementary material effluent ph decreased initially to reach a stable value of 5 9 6 0 after 2 3 h this initial decrease we suspect is due to a slightly ph raising effect of the top filtralite medium which subsides when the medium is covered with deposit fig 2 shows that online effluent turbidity reached a stable level after approximately 3 h and breakthrough started at approximately 14 2 h online inlet turbidity fig 2d in showed an increasing trend which we attribute to particles accumulating in the vertical pipe in which the sensor was installed the upwards flow velocity of 0 5 cm s was probably close to the terminal velocity of some of the influent particles true influent turbidity likely remained stable around the initial value of ca 2 05 ntu 3 2 spatio temporal removal no major differences in microorganism concentrations were found between sampling ports m1 before coagulant dosing and port m2 after coagulant dosing see fig 2 introduced below suggesting that neither microorganism aggregation nor inhibition effects from the coagulant were present to any appreciable extent between coagulant dosing and sample analysis mean influent concentrations c in of each organism were calculated from all m1 and m2 samples and are given in table 4 these were used to compute the passage probability π c c in for all sample ports where c is the concentration in the sample port the log removal is simply log 10 π fig 2 shows the results of all spatio temporal sampling for phage 28b 2a phage ms2 2b e coli 2c and turbidity 2d microorganism removal in fig 2 is presented in terms of log 10 π for visual clarity uncertainty estimates are not included in fig 2 these are instead shown in figures s 6 s 8 in the online supplementary material in general looking at the steepness of the curves fig 2 confirms that the 10 min sample collection time in the automatic sampler was relatively short compared to the time needed for changes in the local concentrations to occur i e the time averaging effect behind each datapoint is relatively small 3 2 1 salm typh 28b fig 2a clearly shows the existence of ripening and breakthrough fronts that migrated across the depth of the filter as the cycle progressed overall removal continued to improve until breakthrough of 28b after approximately 13 h slightly before turbidity breakthrough log removal remained higher than 2 5 for most of the cycle and peaked at about 3 2 it can be seen that at the time of the first auto sample breakthrough of 28b had already occurred at ports a b and c while the lower parts of the filter were still in a ripening phase fig 2a shows that after breakthrough in a given port the concentrations in that port increased before reaching a plateau at the end of the cycle there was still some removal occurring 1 3 log10 units mainly between ports b and c 0 4 log10 units and between port g and the outlet 0 5 log10 units sampling from multiple depths effectively allows a study of the impact of media configuration and filter depths in a single filter run the peak log removal in the upper layer filtralite as measured by port d was around 2 3 compared to the overall peak of 3 2 this is in agreement with previous research that found moderate effects of filter depths and media configurations on virus removal hijnen and medema 2010 harrington et al 2003 hendricks et al 2006 this may be explained by the fact that only a relatively small part of the filter is responsible for the majority of the removal at any given time since ripening occurs progressively across the depth of the filter however breakthrough in the filtralite medium occurred already after approximately 4 h thus while filter depth and media configurations may have a moderate effect on peak removal efficiencies a deeper filter may extend the useful operating period and decrease the number of breakthrough and initial ripening periods per unit time thereby improving the overall mean log removal there are some inconsistent results in fig 2a early in the cycle there is some removal between ports f and g but not between ports d and f which is inconsistent with the assertion that ripening occurs progressively with depth also the concentrations in the manual samples from the outlet m3 are above those from ports g and h early in the cycle we do not have a firm explanation for these results although the early g and h concentrations may have been underestimated because of high plaque counts on some petri dishes in general we trust the manual sampling data somewhat more than the auto sampler data 3 2 2 ms2 the sampling frequency for ms2 is lower than for 28b but the results for the auto samples are qualitatively similar fig 2b compared to 28b removal was slightly poorer for ms2 analyzed by rt qpcr more clearly seen in fig 3 introduced below and peaked at about 3 log10 units after 12 13 h data from plaque assays and rt qpcr are largely consistent with plaque assays apparently indicating a slightly better removal if this is really so it could be caused by some residual inhibitory effect of the coagulant even after the be treatment or possibly some non infectious pcr units that are more poorly removed than infectious ms2 however there is a mid cycle rise in outlet concentrations from rt qpcr that was not observed for the plaque assay or any of the other organisms while the data does not allow firm interpretations we may speculate that this could be related to a breakthrough in the upper part of the filter before sufficient ripening for ms2 has occurred in the lower parts of the filter 3 2 3 e coli the sampling frequency for e coli is also coarser than for 28b but ripening and breakthrough fronts can be observed here as well fig 2c note that all a samples and several b to g samples were above the enumeration limit for the colilert 18 method hence log 10 π is closer to zero for these samples than shown in fig 2c removal peaked at about 4 5 log 10 units but this occurred mid cycle after approximately 9 h and e coli removal had deteriorated significantly by the time of turbidity breakthrough 3 2 4 turbidity the turbidity data fig 2d from within the filter column displays a pattern similar to that of the 28b data at the time of the first auto sample breakthrough had already occurred at ports a b and c for ports d and e it is possible to discern a ripening phase but for the lower ports the noise drowns out the signal after breakthrough turbidity eventually stabilizes compared to the 28b data the rising parts of the curves after breakthrough are slightly steeper in the filtralite medium but less steep in the sand medium indicating slightly different dynamics of turbidity and virus removal in the two media the mechanistic interpretation of such a pattern is not presently clear to us 3 2 5 removal compared fig 3 shows the passage probability for all organisms in a single plot the two viruses behave quite similarly while e coli is both removed to a greater extent and shows faster ripening and earlier breakthrough than the viruses these observations are qualitatively consistent with earlier observations on the ripening and breakthrough behavior of differently sized particles clark et al 1992 kim and lawler 2008 moran et al 1993 although it should be emphasized that a variety of factors besides particle size may play a role in the observed relationships including variations in particle floc and media surface geometry and surface charge particle floc density etc the removal efficiencies of phages ms2 and 28b appear to be quite similar under these experimental conditions these are both nearly spherical viruses but 28b is about twice as large as ms2 towards the very end of the cycle the removal efficiencies appear to converge although we have no firm explanation for this latter observation one may speculate that removal mechanisms that are relatively independent of microorganism properties become more important at this stage since zeta potential measurements are not available for this experiment it is rather difficult to assess the influence of surface charge effects in controlling removal the isoelectric points iep of all three microorganisms are in the range 2 4 and they are therefore all negatively charged at the experimental ph but that is all that can be said without zeta potential data the iep of ms2 is usually reported as between 3 1 and 3 9 michen and graule 2010 the iep of 28b was reported recently as 3 8 christensen et al 2017 and the iep of e coli appears to be between 2 and 3 lytle et al 2002 the pattern with removal efficiencies for 28b ms2 e coli was also observed with zirconium a four valent metal and chitosan a natural organic polymer coagulants with similar raw water and optimized coagulation christensen et al 2017 3 2 6 mean removal evolution perhaps the most interesting analysis made possible by the high resolution data is the much refined computation of mean removal efficiency during the productive part of the filter cycle and the evolution of this mean removal as the filter cycle progresses let t 1 be the time when the filter is put into operation after a backwash event end of filter to waste then the mean probability of passage π m during the time interval from t 1 to t is given by 2 π m t t 1 t q τ c τ d τ t 1 t q τ c in τ d τ q const t 1 t c τ d τ t 1 t c in τ d τ where q is the filtration rate constant in our experiment using π c c in and the fact that c in was also constant in our experiment we have 3 π m t t 1 t π τ d τ t t 1 assuming that π t is differentiable it is readily verified that potential minima of π m t for t t 1 occur when 4 π m t π t which for a typical u shaped time evolution of π t has a unique solution thus if t 1 and π t is given termination of the filter run to minimize mean pathogen passage corresponds to ending the filter run at a time t t 2 that solves 4 the online supplementary material discusses optimal filter runs if we let both t 1 and t 2 be free to choose this is illustrated in fig 4 which shows π m t for viruses 4a and 4b and bacteria 4c for three values of t 1 corresponding to the events of turbidity falling below 0 2 and 0 1 ntu and turbidity becoming stable after approximately 3 h also shown is π t and the normalized cumulative passage ω from our experimental data defined as 5 ω t 0 t q τ c τ d τ 0 t stop q τ c τ d τ q c in const 0 t π τ d τ 0 t stop π τ d τ where t stop is the end time of the experimental run thus ω t gives the ratio of the number of microorganisms that has passed at time t to the total number of organisms that passed during the entire experimental run the curves in fig 4 were computed by direct trapezoidal integration of experimental data there are several points to note in fig 4 first the normalized cumulative passage curves ω t are quite different for viruses and bacteria approximately 40 50 of the virus passage happened in the early stages of the cycle before ripening brought effluent turbidity down to 0 2 ntu the equivalent figure for bacteria is only about 25 2 2 rough estimate since the peak in e coli concentrations were missed because samples were above the enumeration limit fig 2c after turbidity dropped below 0 2 ntu ω t is quite flat for bacteria while it continues to flatten for viruses reflecting different ripening behaviors consequently most of the bacterial passage happened towards the end of the cycle second the marked difference between the instantaneous π t and the mean π m t is apparent when starting water production at turbidity 0 2 ntu the difference is about 1 log unit at the time of microorganism breakthrough it is also clear that π m t varies somewhat depending on when the filter to waste period is terminated and the effect is particularly noticeable if one postpones the production start until turbidity is completely stable at 3 h usually not feasible once breakthrough has occurred the different π m t curves start to converge the overall mean log removal between 32 min turbidity dropped below 0 2 ntu and 14 2 h onset of turbidity breakthrough was computed as 2 5 2 3 and 3 6 for 28b ms2 and e coli respectively this is significantly lower than the corresponding peak log removal of 3 2 3 0 and 4 5 respectively but higher than the log credit values suggested by ødegaard et al 2014 1 5 2 0 for viruses and 2 25 2 5 for bacteria hijnen and medema 2010 in their review reported much lower mean removal efficiencies but their estimates included waste water studies and were also weighted strongly in favor of full scale studies the study that comes closest to our study in terms of raw water characteristics and experimental setup is the one by hendricks et al 2006 indexed 38 and 39 in tables s1 and s2 who reported a log removal for ms2 of 2 9 two hour mean obtained mid cycle huck et al 2001 indexed 34 in tables s 1 and s 2 also observed an increase in log removal efficiency for ms2 during end of run conditions before turbidity breakthrough 2 0 log10 units compared to mid cycle removal 1 4 log10 units their raw water was quite similar to the present study but coagulant doses were lower and they used a cationic polymer interestingly they observed much lower e coli mid cycle removal about 0 5 log10 units than the present study third it is interesting to compare the locations of minima in π t i e time of conventional breakthrough and minima in π m t i e the time of minimized organism passage for viruses breakthrough occurred slightly before turbidity breakthrough but the minimum of π m t for viruses occurred at ms2 or slightly after 28b turbidity breakthrough and 1 2 h after virus breakthrough the location of the minimum of π m t for viruses does not depend strongly on t 1 the start of the production period since the passage probability rises so quickly for viruses after breakthrough for bacteria the situation is different the minima of both π t and π m t occurred several hours before turbidity breakthrough the exact location of the minimum of π m t is more sensitive to t 1 since the passage probability of bacteria rises more slowly in the time right after breakthrough continuing water production until turbidity reaches 0 2 ntu was clearly more detrimental to mean bacteria passage than mean virus passage in this case since the overall increase in π t for bacteria is greater than for viruses it is clear that one cannot strictly optimize for mean bacteria and mean virus passage simultaneously for such a pattern but ending the filter cycle at 13 14 h was close to optimal for all microorganisms investigated fig 4d shows identical computations performed for the turbidity data with the caveat that concepts such as proportion of turbidity passed may not be entirely well defined for turbidity which is not a strictly conserved quantity nevertheless the panel indicates that a greater proportion of the effluent turbidity passage occurred during the period of stable operation i e less of the turbidity passage happened during ripening and breakthrough periods as compared to the microorganisms furthermore the minimum of π m t for turbidity occurred almost immediately after turbidity breakthrough and practically at the same location as for viruses 3 3 headloss fig 5 shows the michau diagram for the filter run which confirms that most of the headloss increase occurred in the upper part of the filtralite layer but there was also some headloss development in the upper part of the sand layer 4 interpretations in terms of filtration modeling classical macroscopic filtration models that describe the dynamic behavior of the filtration process consist essentially of a particle volume conservation equation and a constitutive filtration rate equation iwasaki 1937 herzig et al 1970 tien and ramaro 2007 respectively 6 σ t u c z 0 7 c z λ c here c is the suspended particle concentration volume of particles per unit volume of suspension dim less σ is the specific deposit volume of particles per unit volume of porous medium dim less u is the darcy velocity l t and λ is the filter coefficient 1 l the former equation assumes that dispersive transport is negligible as well as other simplifying approximations horner et al 1986 the latter was first proposed by iwasaki 1937 and remains a standard assumption the system above does not consider particle detachment which may be a limitation the main challenge in deep bed filtration is that λ changes with time as the filter collects particles and it also changes with depth in the filter thus λ is usually taken as a function of σ and is called the filtration function work is ongoing to investigate if there exist appropriate filtration functions for this dataset in the following we rely directly on the data rather than simulation results 4 1 experimental filter coefficients here crude estimates of the mean filter coefficient in each layer were determined directly from the experimental data by computing 8 λ i i 1 1 z i 1 z i ln c i c i 1 where c i is the concentration turbidity in port i and c i 1 is the concentration in the nearest port below both at a given time fig 6 shows the results along with the hydraulic gradients for each layer the data are noisy since we are essentially estimating derivatives based on two data points that are both a little noisy but the wave like progression across the filter depth of the peak in λ can clearly be seen the highest filter coefficients occurred in the upper part of the sand layer which was partly mixed with filtralite after backwashing note the lower temporal sampling resolution of the ms2 e coli data which masks some of their dynamics note also that the distance between sample ports varied so that one may expect that some peaks are averaged down as one moves to the rightmost panels in fig 6 the hydraulic gradient in the lower part of the sand layer started to rise after about 12 h thereby giving an early warning that turbidity breakthrough was imminent the gradient increased some 30 fold in the upper part of the filtralite and there is a variation in initial hydraulic gradients between the various sand layers another indication that there was some mixing of sand and filtralite 4 2 comparison with ideal filtration theory the filter coefficients in fig 6 may be compared to those estimated from ideal filtration theory assuming that near steady state conditions prevail during each 10 min sampling interval substantial research has been devoted to estimating λ from first principles and has been largely successful under favorable conditions for filtration i e no repulsive electrostatic interactions between particles and filter grains tufenkji 2007 in this theory the filter coefficient is given by 9 λ 3 2 1 ε d c α η 0 here ε is the porosity d c is the filter grain collector diameter η 0 is the so called single collector contact efficiency and α the sticking efficiency the latter is assumed to be 1 under favorable conditions the currently most widely used equation for estimating η 0 was developed by tufenkji and elimelech 2004 fig 7 compares peak values of λ taken from fig 6 with those predicted by equation 9 using the expression for η 0 from tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the uncertainty intervals for observed λ values were computed using 95 confidence intervals for concentrations see figures s 6 s 8 in the online supplementary material in equation 9 α was taken as 1 assuming that sufficient coagulation and ripening for favorable conditions had occurred at the time of peak removal for size graded porous media as our filter media it has been recommended to compute η 0 and λ using a grain size that emphasizes the smaller grain fractions such as d 10 pazmino et al 2011 hence we followed this recommendation in order to account for uncertainty in the input parameters to the calculation of η 0 the grey bands in fig 7 show a range of λ values corresponding to a very wide range in the input parameter values assumed to cover all plausible values applicable to our experiment see the figure caption even accounting for the effect of the already retained particles o melia and ali 1979 from fig 7 it is seen that the observed peak λ values are outside the grey bands except for ms2 barely indicating that observed peak λ values were largely inconsistent with those computed from colloid filtration theory based on known microorganism sizes thus even assuming perfectly favorable filtration conditions α 1 and allowing for a wide range of input parameters peak observed removal were higher than predicted by filtration theory possible explanations include departures from the ideal assumptions of filtration theory e g the effect of the pore space being partly filled with deposit and microorganism floc association 4 3 deposit distribution at end of cycle fig 8 shows the results of a simple numerical trapezoidal integration of equation 6 directly from the experimental data for c and indicates how the deposit of particles c for particles assumed proportional to turbidity and 28b was distributed in the filter column at the end of the experiment most of the deposit is in the upper part of the filtralite for both particles and 28b but there is also a noticeable accumulation of deposit in the upper part of the sand layer there is also some non monotonicity within each filter medium 5 overall discussion our results were obtained in a single filter run under a single set of conditions and as such generalizations from our computed removal efficiencies should be done with care the filtration performance may be affected by a range of factors such as e g raw water quality coagulant type and dose use of filter aids filtration rate backwash strategies etc hijnen and medema 2010 in particular our raw water was relatively high in nom and low in turbidity whereas in many places the opposite situation with low nom and high turbidity is more common high nom and low turbidity usually requires higher coagulant doses and stricter ph control edzwald and tobiason 1999 there was no direct confirmation by e g zeta potential measurements that coagulation conditions were optimal in our experiment as mentioned in the introduction effective filtration depends on adequate coagulation for parasites it has been demonstrated that removal may be sensitive to suboptimal coagulation conditions huck et al 2001 2002 still this study demonstrates how dynamic the filter performance may be for viruses and bacteria and what analyses can be performed when high resolution data is available the dynamic microorganism removal observed in this study even during the period of stable effluent turbidity signals that care should be taken when characterizing microbial removal efficiencies during filtration either samples should be taken frequently such as in this study or at least flow proportional continuous sampling should be employed to better estimate true mean removal efficiencies the usefulness of surrogates such as phages for studying removal and inactivation of pathogenic viruses is a continuous concern mesquita and emelko 2012 sinclair et al 2012 recent research shi and tarabara 2018 also suggests that laboratory preparation methods propagation purification for viruses may affect their charge and size distributions as well as hydrophobicity hijnen and medema 2010 suggested that coliphages are appropriate surrogates for pathogenic viruses in deep bed filtration since salmonella typhimurium phage 28b is simple to work with it would be a useful addition to the set of surrogate phages if it can be confirmed that it behaves similarly to ms2 and or other coliphages under a wide range of conditions we believe this study and christensen et al 2017 are the first to use this phage for deep bed filtration experiments for drinking water examples of previous applications include waste water transport in soils carlander et al 2000 small scale waste water treatment systems heistad et al 2009a b and biofilter performance in drinking water treatment persson et al 2005 a concern regarding the applicability of these results and those from most other pilot scale studies is the high influent concentrations used for the microorganisms much higher than what occurs naturally assavasilavasukul et al 2008 observed better removal of cryptosporidium during conventional treatment with higher cryptosporidium influent concentrations prasanthi et al 1997 also observed better removal with higher influent concentrations in laboratory columns without coagulation however it is not clear whether these results apply to viruses in our experiment the virus volume is negligible compared to the total floc volume virus aggregation was not detected and according to standard flocculation theory the virus floc aggregation rate is expected to scale linearly with virus concentrations and thus variations in virus concentrations shouldn t affect removal efficiencies further research is needed to clarify these issues finally the role of virus detachment is also not clear kim and tobiason 2004 if virus detachment is not negligible compared to virus attachment the number of viruses available for detachment becomes important and therefore the observed removal efficiencies may become a function of the influent concentrations the concentrations of all three microorganisms in the influent were chosen sufficiently high that there was no need for dedicated concentration steps during enumeration even for effluent samples taken during peak removal issues associated with analytical recoveries were therefore largely avoided although there may still have been some losses to glassware and plastics pipettes tubes used in the lab these losses are however difficult to assess since all the removal efficiencies are calculated from the ratio of two concentrations losses that are proportional to concentrations would not affect these removal values except for added noise 6 conclusions the following conclusions may be drawn from this work 1 both virus and e coli filtration performance was dynamic showing variations in removal efficiencies during periods of stable effluent turbidity ripening and breakthrough for e coli occurred earlier than for viruses both deviated from turbidity regulatory limits on turbidity typically less than 0 2 ntu appear not to ensure stable operation with respect to virus e coli removal 2 true mean log removal estimates over complete cycles of water production deviated significantly from instantaneous log removal values careful design of sampling regimes is needed to correctly estimate mean removal efficiencies in filtration experiments reporting the removal efficiency of a deep bed filter with a single number may be inappropriate unless the single number is a properly computed mean removal efficiency 3 peak removal of viruses and bacteria between adjacent sampling ports were higher than computed with ideal filtration theory 4 more high resolution studies of microbial filtration performance should be performed in order to collect data under a wider range of conditions we recommend that future studies present results in a manner similar to fig 4 with an axis for total filtered water depth to facilitate comparison between different filter and operational configurations we emphasize again that the main purpose of this study was to generate a high resolution both in space and time mapping of the removal performance throughout a filter cycle mainly with respect to viruses to our knowledge this is the first such high resolution mapping while it would have been desirable to have multiple runs to assess variability between runs and experimental conditions this is a very resource intensive type of investigation which meant that we only saw it possible to run one cycle the main result is that we could demonstrate the impact of time variation on the calculation of mean removal efficiencies while the pattern of time variation may vary between settings or even with aging we believe our study demonstrates the importance of capturing it and accounting for it declaration
