5490,soil water infiltration simulation is a subject receiving great interest in hydrological cycle modelling the traditional horton equation is based on the curve of infiltration capacity rainfall duration time however the infiltration process is directly affected by soil moisture content rather than rainfall duration the objective of this study was to determine a relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture content in order to improve the horton infiltration equation artificial rainfall infiltration experiments were used to determine a series of power functions the improved equation was cross validated with observations from 32 experiments of multiple rainfall intensities and antecedent soil moisture the simulation performance and uncertainty of the improved equation were compared with those of the original horton equation to verify its accuracy the results showed that infiltration rate decreases nonlinearly as soil moisture increases and finally approaches a stable infiltration rate when the soil is saturated overland flow simulations by the improved horton equation closely matched the observations from all 32 experiments over a soil moisture range of 0 222 0 349 m3 m3 the simulation performance was rated as good for most of the experiments for both the calibration and validation data sets compared with the original horton equation the simulation performance of the improved equation clearly improved estimation of infiltration particularly as quantified by the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficient of determination r 2 the number of simulations with nse values greater than 0 65 increased 11 59 and 2 50 for the calibration and validation data sets respectively the number of simulations with r2 values greater than 0 90 increased 31 14 and 22 50 respectively the uncertainty intervals of the improved horton equation became a little greater than those of the original horton equation for all 32 experimental simulations the average relative length of the uncertainty interval at the 95 confidence level increased from 40 52 with the original horton equation to 49 17 with the improved horton equation the number of observations falling within the 95 confidence interval increased from 92 13 to 95 94 with the improved horton equation most of the observations were accurately simulated using the improved horton equation the greatest improvements in simulating overland flow were seen for the experiments with low flow simulations the study results provide insights into soil infiltration mechanisms and also provide references to support improved infiltration simulation by considering soil moisture variation keywords infiltration capacity rainfall soil moisture nonlinear relationship uncertainty estimation improved horton equation 1 introduction infiltration is one of the critical hydrological processes it determines the vertical redistribution of rainfall among surface water and soil moisture in different soil layers and significantly affects interchanges between surface water and groundwater ferguson 2017 total infiltration is estimated to be 27 0 of total precipitation at the global scale oki and kanae 2006 and the proportion could even be over 75 0 in some karst regions jemcov and petric 2009 infiltration is strongly related to water conservation maintenance of ecosystem functions and health flood control etc for example infiltration clearly decreases as the amount of impermeable pavement in metropolitan regions increases resulting in greater frequencies of urban flooding and waterlogging that have been observed in recent decades ebrahimian et al 2016 locatelli et al 2017 therefore investigation of the mechanisms of infiltration is one of the foundational and important subjects receiving great interest in the hydrology community these studies provide scientific support for a large number of hydrological or ecological related projects in the world such as sponge city construction artificial recharge of groundwater and ecological restoration bonneau et al 2018 kidmose et al 2015 xia et al 2017 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 the infiltration mechanism is complicated because it is highly affected by numerous factors including rainfall intensity and duration soil characteristics soil moisture watershed topography and land cover dunkerley 2012 schoener and stone 2019 sihag et al 2019 wang et al 2015 yu and coulthard 2015 many infiltration models have been proposed and can be divided into three categories i e physically based models empirical models and semi empirical models mishra and singh 1999 sihag et al 2017 vand et al 2018 the physically based models are directly deduced from the law of mass conservation i e darcy s laws with a variety of simplifications and assumptions the models are able to reflect the influence of different soil physical parameters and boundary conditions on infiltration and provide results with high temporal and spatial resolutions ali et al 2016 ma et al 2010 however they require more input data as well as proper calibration before they can be successfully applied the physically based models have been developed by green and ampt 1911 philip 1957 1969 mein and larson 1971 1973 smith 1972 and smith et al 2002 the empirical models were developed based on a series of experimental observations have simplified structures and are easily applied to fields with little information typical models have been proposed by kostiakov 1932 and collis george 1977 the semi empirical models employ simplified forms of the continuity equations and the relationships hypothesized between infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration these models were usually developed using a systems approach which is popularly employed in surface hydrology and are a compromise between empirical and physically based models mishra et al 2003 the horton equation horton 1933 1938 is one of the most widely used semi empirical models the classical exhaustion process in nature is used in the horton equation to derive the infiltration capacity variation with time during rain all of the processes affecting the rate of change of infiltration capacity are linearly proportional to the infiltration capacity remaining to be performed horton 1941 although the horton equation is semi empirical it reveals the similar pattern of infiltration rate decline from the initial infiltration rate to the stable infiltration rate as other physically based models such as the green ampt model and the philip model beven 2004 however some shortcomings still exist in the horton equation for example the reduction law of infiltration capacity is accurate only when rainfall intensity exceeds infiltration capacity dunkerley 2018 additionally the initial infiltration capacity is usually fixed without considering variations of the antecedent soil moisture conditions and thus the equation is deficient for simulating the variable infiltration occurring under varying antecedent soil moisture conditions davidsen et al 2017 hayek 2018 in practice the infiltration capacity only depends on the cumulative infiltration volume rather than the previous rainfall history assouline 2013 some improvements to the horton equation have been made bauer 1974 proposed a modified horton equation that used a simple linear relationship between soil moisture and accumulated infiltration esen and almedeij 2013 modified the horton equation by considering the rainfall intensity as an independent variable in addition to the other parameters used in the original model and this is similar to the improvement proposed by verma 1982 assouline 2013 adopted the time compression approximation method to deal with the restrictions of intermittent rainfall events and the equivalent time was calculated based on the post cumulative infiltration from the horton integrated curve however all of these improvements are still based on the relationships between infiltration capacity and rainfall duration and do not reflect the cumulative infiltration variation that occurs with the increase of soil moisture which is one of the critical driving forces closely related to capillary potential gradients for water infiltration into the soil liu et al 2011 therefore incorporating the relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture may be an effective way to improve the horton equation the objectives of this study were to explore the relationship between infiltration and soil moisture using controlled experiments and to propose an improved horton equation to simulate the rainfall infiltration process with consideration of soil moisture variation following the basic form of the original horton equation the specific objectives were to 1 determine relationships between experimentally observed infiltration data and soil moisture 2 derive the infiltration soil moisture equation following the basic form of the horton equation 3 validate the applicability and enhancement of the infiltration soil moisture equation by comparing its simulation performance and uncertainty intervals with those of the original horton equation this study is expected to provide new insights into soil infiltration processes under variable rainfall and antecedent soil moisture conditions and to further promote the applicability and scope of the horton equation in the complicated field of hydrological modelling 2 artificial rainfall infiltration experiment an artificial rainfall infiltration experimental system was designed to analyze the relationship between soil moisture and infiltration capacity the system consisted of three parts including a test cube of soil an artificial rainfall simulation apparatus and monitoring devices fig 1 the system was able to provide multiple artificial simulated rainfall intensities ranging from 30 to 200 mm h and could monitor the high precision overflow and soil moisture changes at five different depths of the test soil cube the test soil cube container 100 cm 100 cm 50 cm was made of acrylic glass and stainless steel brackets the container was filled with sandy loam soil based on the usda textural triangle sampled from the chaobai river basin beijing china the soil particle sizes ranged from 0 02 μm to 500 μm with a median size of 67 μm the soil was placed into the container in 5 cm depth intervals ensuring that the entire soil cube was uniformly compacted to a dry bulk density of 1 43 g cm3 with a soil porosity of 0 48 water was pumped into the artificial rainfall simulation manifold from a storage tank to produce a steady and spatially uniform spray pattern above the soil cube through a series of uniformly distributed spray nozzles the water pressure from the pump was controlled by a pressure regulator and the flow rate was recorded by a rotameter the simulated precipitation intensity was obtained by dividing the pumped water volume by the rainfall area the rainfall intensity was controlled by adjusting the pressure regulator during the experiment the desired rainfall was sprayed above the soil cube and subsequently infiltrated into the soil when the infiltration capacity decreased to the rainfall intensity overflow occurred and was directed through a pipe to a runoff collector box the weight of the cumulative runoff in the runoff collector box was recorded by a high precision electronic weighing scale and the overland flow rate was calculated by the difference in weight per unit time 0 01 mm h precision 1 s intervals in addition to measuring runoff soil moisture was measured at five depths using soil electrical conductivity ec sensors i e decagon ec 5 https www metergroup com environment products ec 5 soil moisture sensor before the experiment the ec sensors were calibrated by establishing the relationship between the voltage value measured by the probes and the soil moisture measured by weight of soil samples with different soil moisture contents the ec probes were then placed in the center of cross sections at 5 10 15 20 25 cm below the soil surface and the soil moisture data were recorded once per minute the soil moisture value for the soil cube was calculated by averaging all five soil moisture sensors after each experiment we dried out the saturated soil cube using two bath heaters and in this way we controlled the antecedent volumetric soil moisture for the next experiment multiple rainfall intensities and antecedent soil moisture contents were considered in our study the 32 experimental scenarios were conducted with rainfall intensity ranging from 68 4 to 171 0 mm h and antecedent volumetric soil moisture content ranging from 0 222 to 0 349 m3 m3 table 1 3 model improvement and validation 3 1 derivation of infiltration capacity soil moisture equation the assumption of the horton equation is that the reduction of infiltration capacity obeys the nature of exhaustion process as an inverse exponential law as rainfall continues horton 1941 this means that the infiltration capacity f mm h decreases gradually with rainfall duration t hour and approaches a constant value i e stable infiltration capacity fc mm h when the rainfall duration increases to infinity the rate at which infiltration capacity df dt declines is proportional to the remaining infiltration capacity f0 f the original horton equation was given as follows 1 f t f c f 0 f c e k t where f0 is the initial value of infiltration capacity mm h at the beginning of rainfall k is the soil specific decay constant the horton infiltration capacity time curve was proposed to simulate the variation of infiltration capacity with time during continuous rainfall events however the reduction of infiltration capacity is mainly caused by increasing soil moisture both the initial and stable infiltration capacities are also highly related to soil moisture the initial infiltration capacity approaches infinity if the antecedent soil moisture is very dry while it approaches a stable constant value if the soil is saturated however numerous other factors in addition to rainfall such as irrigation overland flow evapotranspiration are also able to vary soil moisture and thus inevitably affect infiltration capacity furthermore the infiltration capacity cannot be precisely determined from the horton equation when the rainfall intensity is less than the infiltration capacity or the rainfall stops all of these issues restrict the application of the horton equation in infiltration and runoff simulations due to the intermittent nature of rainfall therefore soil moisture θ at time t should be incorporated into the horton equation experimental observations have shown that soil moisture changes with time fig 2 follow a power function relationship of the form 2 θ θ 0 θ c θ 0 1 t n where θ0 and θc are the initial and saturated soil moisture respectively n is the power exponent which is greater than zero therefore t can be derived as 3 t 1 θ θ 0 θ c θ 1 n 1 equation 3 can be expanded by the taylor series method as 4 t j 1 i 1 j 1 n i 1 j θ θ 0 θ c θ j thus eq 1 can be written as 5 f θ f c f 0 f c e k j 1 i 1 j 1 n i 1 j θ θ 0 θ c θ j equation 5 is an improved form of the horton equation that incorporates the relationship between the infiltration capacity and soil moisture furthermore the upper and lower boundaries of soil moisture θc and θ0 can be applied to test the variation ranges of infiltration capacity 6 lim θ θ 0 f c f 0 f c e k j 1 i 1 j 1 n i 1 j θ θ 0 θ c θ j f 0 7 lim θ θ c f c f 0 f c e k j 1 i 1 j 1 n i 1 j θ θ 0 θ c θ j f c the infiltration capacity approaches the initial infiltration capacity f0 if θ θ0 eq 6 while it approaches a stable constant fc if θ θc eq 7 therefore the improved horton equation produces infiltration capacity that varies with soil moisture in our study the improved horton equation eq 5 was simplified by setting j to 1 and was validated by experimental observations therefore the simplified equation is given as follows 8 f θ f c f 0 f c e k n θ θ 0 θ c θ f c f 0 f c e k θ θ 0 θ c θ where k is the soil specific decay parameter of the improved horton equation overland flow observations were used to validate the simulation performance of the improved horton equation because the infiltration process is usually difficult to observe the overland flow simulation is derived as follow 9 r θ p e t f θ p e t f c f 0 f c e k θ θ 0 θ c θ where r θ is the total overland flow mm h p and et are the rainfall and evapotranspiration rates mm h for the runoff event simulation et can be ignored due to the short duration of the event 3 2 model calibration and validation the observations of numerous rainfall runoff events were compared with those of the horton equation and the improved horton equation to determine if improvement in overland flow simulation had been achieved by the improved horton equation both the improved and original horton equations were auto calibrated by the monte carlo method and the calibrated parameters for f0 fc and k for the horton equation and f0 fc and k for the improved horton equation are shown in table 2 three statistical criteria were used to assess the simulation performance nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r 2 and volume error ve the equations are given as follows 10 nse 1 q obs i q sim i 2 q obs i q obs 2 11 r 2 q obs i q obs q sim i q sim 2 q obs i q obs 2 q sim i q sim 2 12 ve q sim q obs q obs 100 where qobs i and qsim i are the i th observed and simulated overland flow mm h q obs and q sim are the average observed and simulated overland flow mm h greater nse or r 2 values mean better simulation performance and the optimal value is one moreover the optimal value of ve is zero and ve values close to zero indicate better simulation performance in our study if the nse and r2 values were greater than 0 60 and 0 80 respectively and the ve values were within 15 the simulation performance was considered good if the nse and r2 values were greater than 0 80 and 0 90 respectively and the ve values were within 10 the simulation performance considered very good these three criteria were aggregated into one objective parameter e as 13 e nse r 2 2 v e values of e can range from to 1 with the optimal value being 1 twenty cross validations were performed by randomly dividing all the observations from the 32 experiments into calibration 22 experiments and validation 10 experiments observations for each cross validation five thousand iterations were implemented by the monte carlo method 3 3 model uncertainty estimation the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method glue was used to estimate the uncertainties of both the original and the improved horton equation the uncertainty results were compared to verify the reliability of simulation performance in addition to nse two other statistical criteria were used for uncertainty estimation average relative interval length at the 95 confidence level aril and the percentage of observations falling within the 95 confidence interval p 95ci jin et al 2010 li et al 2010 zhang and shao 2018 14 aril 1 n t 1 n q sim 97 5 t q sim 2 5 t q obs t 100 15 p 95 c i n o in n 100 where qsim 97 5 and qsim 2 5 are the 97 5th and the 2 5th percentages of behavioral groups of the overland flow simulation series mm h noin is the number of observations which fell within the 95 confidence interval smaller aril values indicate that uncertainty intervals are narrower and larger values of p 95ci indicate that uncertainty intervals are more reliable five thousand iterations were implemented by the monte carlo method for each experiment if the nse was greater than 0 60 the corresponding parameter sets were considered to be behavioral for uncertainty estimation otherwise the parameter sets were considered to be non behavioral 4 results 4 1 experimental observations of variable infiltration the variations in infiltration rate under different soil moisture conditions are shown in fig 3 a the infiltration rate was observed to decline nonlinearly as soil moisture increased considering the data from all 32 experiments infiltration rate decreased from 120 mm h to 30 mm h while soil moisture increased from 0 27 to 0 44 m3 m3 at the initial stage of each experiment due to the low soil moisture condition the infiltration rate rapidly declined from 100 to 40 mm h as the soil moisture increased from 0 27 to 0 38 m3 m3 the decline was more apparent when the antecedent soil moisture was dry e g 0 22 0 26 m3 m3 fig 3b the relative change of infiltration rate became smaller and smaller as soil moisture increased particularly when soil moisture was greater than 0 38 m3 m3 the infiltration rate eventually approached the stable infiltration capacity i e 25 35 mm h as the soil gradually became saturated i e 0 40 0 44 m3 m3 the overall relationship between infiltration rate and soil moisture for all of the data collected was fitted by equation 8 and produced a coefficient of determination of 0 60 fig 3a since the antecedent soil moisture is a critical impact factor the experimental observations were divided into three groups according to the antecedent soil moisture i e 0 22 0 26 m3 m3 0 26 0 30 m3 m3 and 0 30 0 35 m3 m3 fig 3b the fitting performance increased for the antecedent soil moisture conditions of 0 22 0 26 m3 m3 and 0 26 0 30 m3 m3 r2 of 0 63 and 0 63 respectively compared with the fitting performance for all data combined however the fitting performance was somewhat worse r2 of 0 51 when the antecedent soil moisture was 0 30 0 35 m3 m3 although the fitting performance gradually became worse as antecedent soil moisture increased the fitting performance for all three groups was satisfactory therefore the improved horton equation was useful for reflecting the nonlinear relationship between infiltration rate and soil moisture 4 2 simulation performance for multiple experiments the simulations with the improved horton equation showed good agreement with the observations the cross validation results showed that all of the statistical criteria of simulation performance were considered very good in most of the experiments in both the calibration and validation data sets fig 4 the nse values ranged from 0 75 to 1 00 in most experiments in particular 75 00 of the total calibration experiments and 61 00 of the total validation experiments had nse values greater than 0 65 there were 73 86 of the total calibration experiments and 65 50 of the total validation experiments with r2 values greater than 0 90 the ve values in nearly 30 of total experiments were less than 2 5 there were 75 00 of the total calibration experiments and 63 50 of the total validation experiments with ve values of 10 furthermore the e values in nearly 50 of total experiments ranged from 0 80 to 0 90 for both the calibration and validation data sets there were 75 23 of the total calibration experiments and 63 50 of the total validation experiments with e values greater than 0 70 simulation performance by the improved horton equation was clearly improved compared with the original horton equation and the frequencies of the performance indices considered to be at the good and very good performance levels increased substantially particularly for nse and r2 the frequencies of nse values greater than 0 65 increased 11 59 and 2 50 for the calibration and validation data sets respectively the frequencies of r2 values greater than 0 90 increased 31 14 and 22 50 respectively the frequencies of ve values that were 10 did not change obviously and the frequencies of e values greater than 0 70 increased 10 91 and 4 50 respectively therefore the improved horton equation could better capture infiltration variation with time than the original horton equation for the individual experiment simulations by the cross validations there were 76 00 92 00 and 83 00 of the total simulations that were at the good or very good performance levels for nse r2 and ve respectively fig 5 when all three of these performance criteria were considered 71 00 of the total simulations were at the good or very good performance level the overland flow for experiments 2 6 7 12 13 15 18 22 24 27 31 was simulated very well with performance for over 80 of 20 cross validations at the good or very good performance level according to the values of nse r 2 and ve in these 17 experiments the antecedent soil moisture ranged from 0 222 to 0 349 m3 m3 and the rainfall intensity ranged from 68 4 to 171 mm h in particular the total cross validations for experiments 12 15 20 21 24 and 28 31 showed good simulation performance the best simulation performance was for experiment 30 very good with the best nse r2 and ve of 0 97 0 97 and 0 40 respectively however due to the larger ve and smaller nse the overland flow values for experiments 1 4 5 9 25 26 and 32 were not simulated well with performance for less than half of the 20 cross validations at the good or very good performance levels in particular the worst simulation was seen for experiment 9 antecedent soil moisture 0 260 m3 m3 rainfall intensity 91 2 mm h with only 10 0 of the total cross validations were good or very good and the worst nse r2 and ve were 0 95 0 84 and 34 25 respectively the simulation performance of the cross validation tests for individual experiments were also compared with those of the original horton equation except for experiments 1 5 16 23 25 27 and 32 the simulation performance statistics of most experiments 20 of 32 were noticeably improved for nse obvious improvements were seen for experiments 3 9 17 and 26 with average values increasing by over 50 obvious increases in r2 were seen for experiments 4 7 9 13 14 18 and 19 with average values increasing by nearly 10 the most obvious improvements in ve were observed for experiments 3 8 11 24 26 31 and 32 with average values decreasing by over 50 for the comprehensive simulation performance statistic e obvious improvements were observed for experiments 3 9 17 and 26 furthermore the percentage of total experiments with the very good performance rating increased from 5 to 80 for 20 out of 32 experiments 62 5 and only seven experiments 2 16 20 23 25 27 and 29 had percentages decrease slightly from 5 to 35 fig 6 a and c the percentage of total experiments with the good performance rating increased from 5 to 80 for 20 out of 32 experiments 62 5 and only six experiments 1 5 16 23 25 and 32 had percentages decrease slightly from 5 and 35 fig 6b and d therefore the obvious improvements mainly occurred for the experiments with lower rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture conditions such as experiments 3 and 9 4 3 uncertainty estimations the average relative interval length at the 95 confidence level aril in the 32 experiments ranged from 20 14 to 89 59 with an average value of 49 17 fig 7 the percentage of observations falling within the 95 confidence interval p 95ci ranged from 66 86 to 100 with an average value of 95 94 the observations which were outside of the confidence intervals were usually from the high overland flow conditions such as for experiments 7 8 11 and 26 the simulations for the rest of the experiments were much more reliable because over 95 of the total observations were within the uncertainty intervals though these intervals for experiments 1 2 4 5 10 14 16 19 21 and 30 were a little larger with the aril of over 50 however the simulations of experiments 7 and 8 were less reliable because only 66 86 and 77 01 of total observations were within the uncertainty intervals respectively the aril values from most of the simulations for the 32 experiments were much greater with the improved horton equation than with the original horton equation except for experiments 10 23 and 24 fig 8 the largest percentage increases were 27 66 25 84 and 21 71 for experiments 17 1 and 9 respectively also more observations for most experiments were within the uncertainty intervals with the improved horton equation than for the original horton equation except for experiments 8 11 18 19 23 24 26 28 29 and 31 the greatest changes were for the low overland flow situation such as observed in experiments 1 2 4 6 7 9 12 15 and 17 for the p 95ci the largest percentage increases were 52 94 for experiment 9 therefore the simulations for most experiments were more reliable with the improved horton equation than with the original horton equation and the most obvious improvements were for the low overland flow simulations 5 discussion soil infiltration is one of many complicated hydrological processes and is affected by rainfall intensity and duration soil moisture soil structure human activities e g irrigation tillage and so on mishra et al 2003 liu et al 2011 most previous studies have focused on the reduction of infiltration capacity with rainfall duration horton 1938 however the reduction of infiltration capacity is mainly the result of decreased capillary potential gradients and increased soil moisture rather than the increase of time huang et al 2013 yi and fan 2016 therefore the key issue to investigate is the relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture artificial rainfall experiments and numerical simulations are of great benefit to obtain accurate observations of rainfall rate infiltration rate and soil moisture under multiple controlled scenarios in order to determine rainfall infiltration relationships and the physical mechanisms that strongly influence them the nonlinear relationships between infiltration capacity and soil moisture were identified using experimental observations and those relationships obeyed the law of the natural exhaustion process horton 1941 that is the initial infiltration capacity is large because the soil is dry and the vertical hydraulic gradient is large as soil moisture increases the soil pore space is filled by water and thus both the vertical hydraulic gradient and the infiltration capacity decrease li et al 2010 the rate at which infiltration capacity decreases also gradually decreases finally the infiltration capacity approaches a stable constant value when the soil becomes saturated this relationship might provide a more reasonable and intuitive explanation that explicitly describes the physical mechanism of infiltration capacity variation with time whether or not rain occurs corradini et al 1997 chahinian et al 2005 such relationships are more easily used and observed because the condition of rainfall duration extended to infinity is replaced by the saturated soil condition therefore our study explored the nonlinear relationship between infiltration and soil moisture using controlled experiments and adopted this relationship to improve the infiltration simulation performance of the horton equation with consideration of soil moisture variation the validity of the relationship was verified by comparison of the simulation performance with the original horton equation the simulation performance of most of the 32 experiments with different rainfall intensities and antecedent soil moisture were improved when compared with those of the original horton equation particularly for the lower overland flow conditions or for the experiments with lower rainfall intensities and antecedent soil moisture for example for experiment 9 with antecedent soil moisture of 0 260 m3 m3 the average and maximum nse values increased from 0 21 to 0 16 and from 0 51 to 0 92 respectively among all of the cross validation tests furthermore the simulation performance was also compared with a previous study which was simulated using the short duration infiltration process model ship and using the same experimental system wang et al 2017 the ve and nse values indicated greater simulation accuracy for the improved horton equation than for ship for a given antecedent soil moisture for example the statistical criteria were greatly improved when the antecedent soil moisture was 0 26 the ve ranged from 3 26 to 2 72 for the improved horton equation and from 19 71 to 11 36 for the ship model the nse ranged from 0 90 to 0 96 for the improved horton equation and only from 0 52 to 0 86 for ship therefore the improved horton equation greatly benefits the continuous simulation of infiltration and overland flow particularly under water restricted conditions such as found in arid and semi arid regions however our study was only done with one soil type i e the sandy loam soil from the chaobai river basin china soil type directly determines the soil structure the water holding capacity and the variations of infiltration capacity li et al 2010 thus all of the parameters of both the original and improved horton equations are highly related to the soil types more experiments should be implemented by considering more soil types and the improved equation could be further tested moreover our improved horton equation still supported the hypothesis of the natural exhaustion process that follows a simple inverse exponential relationship horton 1941 both our improved horton equation and the original horton equation are semi empirical models that may possibly introduce more parameter uncertainties in the model structure than those of physically based models mishra et al 2003 chahinian et al 2005 for example although most experimental observations fell within the uncertainty intervals the average relative interval length was from 20 14 to 89 59 additionally the simplified equations still have a challenge in describing the variations of infiltration capacity or soil moisture with time such as is done with exponential and power functions horton 1941 hayek 2018 the power function was adopted in our study for the soil moisture time curves due to its simplicity further studies could be implemented to compare the relative performance of the power function compared with the exponential function and their combination for simulating variable infiltration 6 conclusions soil water infiltration is one of the critical hydrological processes and its simulation is still difficult in hydrological cycle modelling due to soil spatial heterogeneity and complicated soil structure in our study both an artificial rainfall experiment and numerical simulation were used to investigate the relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture the results showed that 1 infiltration capacity decreases nonlinearly as soil moisture increased and approached a stable infiltration capacity as the soil became saturated the power function fit the soil moisture time curve data and was adopted to describe the nonlinear relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture the fitting performance for all 32 rainfall simulation experiments was good with coefficients of determination greater than 0 50 particularly for the low antecedent soil moisture conditions 2 compared with the simulation performance of the original horton equation the simulation performance of the improved horton equation was much better particularly with respect to nse and r 2 for the improved horton equation there were 75 00 of the total calibration experiments and 61 00 of the total validation experiments with nse values greater than 0 65 there were 73 86 of the total calibration experiments and 65 50 of the total validation experiments with r2 values greater than 0 90 for the original horton equation only 63 41 of the nse values in the calibration data set and 58 50 of the nse values in the validation data set were greater than 0 65 additionally 42 73 of the r2 values in the calibration data set and 43 00 of the r2 values in the validation data set were greater than 0 90 the greatest improvements with the improved horton equation were for the experiments with lower rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture 3 the uncertainty intervals of the improved horton equation became a little greater than those of the original horton equation for all 32 rainfall simulation experiments the average relative interval lengths at the 95 confidence level were 49 17 and 40 52 using the improved and original horton equations respectively however the percentage of observations falling within the 95 confidence interval increased greatly from 92 13 to 95 94 most of the observations could be captured using the improved horton equation and the greatest improvements were for the low overland flow simulations for each experiment the nonlinear relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture used in this study greatly improved the simulation performance of the horton equation however all of these simulations were implemented using experimental observations at the soil cube scale and only one soil type was used further experiments should be implemented at the real basin scale while considering intermittent rainfall and more complicated underlying conditions additionally other possible alternative equations could be adopted to determine the curves for soil moisture time infiltration time or infiltration soil moisture relationships simulation performance could then be validated and compared as we have done in this study to determine the most reasonable equations for describing rainfall infiltration processes credit authorship contribution statement moyuan yang methodology software formal analysis resources data

5490,soil water infiltration simulation is a subject receiving great interest in hydrological cycle modelling the traditional horton equation is based on the curve of infiltration capacity rainfall duration time however the infiltration process is directly affected by soil moisture content rather than rainfall duration the objective of this study was to determine a relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture content in order to improve the horton infiltration equation artificial rainfall infiltration experiments were used to determine a series of power functions the improved equation was cross validated with observations from 32 experiments of multiple rainfall intensities and antecedent soil moisture the simulation performance and uncertainty of the improved equation were compared with those of the original horton equation to verify its accuracy the results showed that infiltration rate decreases nonlinearly as soil moisture increases and finally approaches a stable infiltration rate when the soil is saturated overland flow simulations by the improved horton equation closely matched the observations from all 32 experiments over a soil moisture range of 0 222 0 349 m3 m3 the simulation performance was rated as good for most of the experiments for both the calibration and validation data sets compared with the original horton equation the simulation performance of the improved equation clearly improved estimation of infiltration particularly as quantified by the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficient of determination r 2 the number of simulations with nse values greater than 0 65 increased 11 59 and 2 50 for the calibration and validation data sets respectively the number of simulations with r2 values greater than 0 90 increased 31 14 and 22 50 respectively the uncertainty intervals of the improved horton equation became a little greater than those of the original horton equation for all 32 experimental simulations the average relative length of the uncertainty interval at the 95 confidence level increased from 40 52 with the original horton equation to 49 17 with the improved horton equation the number of observations falling within the 95 confidence interval increased from 92 13 to 95 94 with the improved horton equation most of the observations were accurately simulated using the improved horton equation the greatest improvements in simulating overland flow were seen for the experiments with low flow simulations the study results provide insights into soil infiltration mechanisms and also provide references to support improved infiltration simulation by considering soil moisture variation keywords infiltration capacity rainfall soil moisture nonlinear relationship uncertainty estimation improved horton equation 1 introduction infiltration is one of the critical hydrological processes it determines the vertical redistribution of rainfall among surface water and soil moisture in different soil layers and significantly affects interchanges between surface water and groundwater ferguson 2017 total infiltration is estimated to be 27 0 of total precipitation at the global scale oki and kanae 2006 and the proportion could even be over 75 0 in some karst regions jemcov and petric 2009 infiltration is strongly related to water conservation maintenance of ecosystem functions and health flood control etc for example infiltration clearly decreases as the amount of impermeable pavement in metropolitan regions increases resulting in greater frequencies of urban flooding and waterlogging that have been observed in recent decades ebrahimian et al 2016 locatelli et al 2017 therefore investigation of the mechanisms of infiltration is one of the foundational and important subjects receiving great interest in the hydrology community these studies provide scientific support for a large number of hydrological or ecological related projects in the world such as sponge city construction artificial recharge of groundwater and ecological restoration bonneau et al 2018 kidmose et al 2015 xia et al 2017 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 the infiltration mechanism is complicated because it is highly affected by numerous factors including rainfall intensity and duration soil characteristics soil moisture watershed topography and land cover dunkerley 2012 schoener and stone 2019 sihag et al 2019 wang et al 2015 yu and coulthard 2015 many infiltration models have been proposed and can be divided into three categories i e physically based models empirical models and semi empirical models mishra and singh 1999 sihag et al 2017 vand et al 2018 the physically based models are directly deduced from the law of mass conservation i e darcy s laws with a variety of simplifications and assumptions the models are able to reflect the influence of different soil physical parameters and boundary conditions on infiltration and provide results with high temporal and spatial resolutions ali et al 2016 ma et al 2010 however they require more input data as well as proper calibration before they can be successfully applied the physically based models have been developed by green and ampt 1911 philip 1957 1969 mein and larson 1971 1973 smith 1972 and smith et al 2002 the empirical models were developed based on a series of experimental observations have simplified structures and are easily applied to fields with little information typical models have been proposed by kostiakov 1932 and collis george 1977 the semi empirical models employ simplified forms of the continuity equations and the relationships hypothesized between infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration these models were usually developed using a systems approach which is popularly employed in surface hydrology and are a compromise between empirical and physically based models mishra et al 2003 the horton equation horton 1933 1938 is one of the most widely used semi empirical models the classical exhaustion process in nature is used in the horton equation to derive the infiltration capacity variation with time during rain all of the processes affecting the rate of change of infiltration capacity are linearly proportional to the infiltration capacity remaining to be performed horton 1941 although the horton equation is semi empirical it reveals the similar pattern of infiltration rate decline from the initial infiltration rate to the stable infiltration rate as other physically based models such as the green ampt model and the philip model beven 2004 however some shortcomings still exist in the horton equation for example the reduction law of infiltration capacity is accurate only when rainfall intensity exceeds infiltration capacity dunkerley 2018 additionally the initial infiltration capacity is usually fixed without considering variations of the antecedent soil moisture conditions and thus the equation is deficient for simulating the variable infiltration occurring under varying antecedent soil moisture conditions davidsen et al 2017 hayek 2018 in practice the infiltration capacity only depends on the cumulative infiltration volume rather than the previous rainfall history assouline 2013 some improvements to the horton equation have been made bauer 1974 proposed a modified horton equation that used a simple linear relationship between soil moisture and accumulated infiltration esen and almedeij 2013 modified the horton equation by considering the rainfall intensity as an independent variable in addition to the other parameters used in the original model and this is similar to the improvement proposed by verma 1982 assouline 2013 adopted the time compression approximation method to deal with the restrictions of intermittent rainfall events and the equivalent time was calculated based on the post cumulative infiltration from the horton integrated curve however all of these improvements are still based on the relationships between infiltration capacity and rainfall duration and do not reflect the cumulative infiltration variation that occurs with the increase of soil moisture which is one of the critical driving forces closely related to capillary potential gradients for water infiltration into the soil liu et al 2011 therefore incorporating the relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture may be an effective way to improve the horton equation the objectives of this study were to explore the relationship between infiltration and soil moisture using controlled experiments and to propose an improved horton equation to simulate the rainfall infiltration process with consideration of soil moisture variation following the basic form of the original horton equation the specific objectives were to 1 determine relationships between experimentally observed infiltration data and soil moisture 2 derive the infiltration soil moisture equation following the basic form of the horton equation 3 validate the applicability and enhancement of the infiltration soil moisture equation by comparing its simulation performance and uncertainty intervals with those of the original horton equation this study is expected to provide new insights into soil infiltration processes under variable rainfall and antecedent soil moisture conditions and to further promote the applicability and scope of the horton equation in the complicated field of hydrological modelling 2 artificial rainfall infiltration experiment an artificial rainfall infiltration experimental system was designed to analyze the relationship between soil moisture and infiltration capacity the system consisted of three parts including a test cube of soil an artificial rainfall simulation apparatus and monitoring devices fig 1 the system was able to provide multiple artificial simulated rainfall intensities ranging from 30 to 200 mm h and could monitor the high precision overflow and soil moisture changes at five different depths of the test soil cube the test soil cube container 100 cm 100 cm 50 cm was made of acrylic glass and stainless steel brackets the container was filled with sandy loam soil based on the usda textural triangle sampled from the chaobai river basin beijing china the soil particle sizes ranged from 0 02 μm to 500 μm with a median size of 67 μm the soil was placed into the container in 5 cm depth intervals ensuring that the entire soil cube was uniformly compacted to a dry bulk density of 1 43 g cm3 with a soil porosity of 0 48 water was pumped into the artificial rainfall simulation manifold from a storage tank to produce a steady and spatially uniform spray pattern above the soil cube through a series of uniformly distributed spray nozzles the water pressure from the pump was controlled by a pressure regulator and the flow rate was recorded by a rotameter the simulated precipitation intensity was obtained by dividing the pumped water volume by the rainfall area the rainfall intensity was controlled by adjusting the pressure regulator during the experiment the desired rainfall was sprayed above the soil cube and subsequently infiltrated into the soil when the infiltration capacity decreased to the rainfall intensity overflow occurred and was directed through a pipe to a runoff collector box the weight of the cumulative runoff in the runoff collector box was recorded by a high precision electronic weighing scale and the overland flow rate was calculated by the difference in weight per unit time 0 01 mm h precision 1 s intervals in addition to measuring runoff soil moisture was measured at five depths using soil electrical conductivity ec sensors i e decagon ec 5 https www metergroup com environment products ec 5 soil moisture sensor before the experiment the ec sensors were calibrated by establishing the relationship between the voltage value measured by the probes and the soil moisture measured by weight of soil samples with different soil moisture contents the ec probes were then placed in the center of cross sections at 5 10 15 20 25 cm below the soil surface and the soil moisture data were recorded once per minute the soil moisture value for the soil cube was calculated by averaging all five soil moisture sensors after each experiment we dried out the saturated soil cube using two bath heaters and in this way we controlled the antecedent volumetric soil moisture for the next experiment multiple rainfall intensities and antecedent soil moisture contents were considered in our study the 32 experimental scenarios were conducted with rainfall intensity ranging from 68 4 to 171 0 mm h and antecedent volumetric soil moisture content ranging from 0 222 to 0 349 m3 m3 table 1 3 model improvement and validation 3 1 derivation of infiltration capacity soil moisture equation the assumption of the horton equation is that the reduction of infiltration capacity obeys the nature of exhaustion process as an inverse exponential law as rainfall continues horton 1941 this means that the infiltration capacity f mm h decreases gradually with rainfall duration t hour and approaches a constant value i e stable infiltration capacity fc mm h when the rainfall duration increases to infinity the rate at which infiltration capacity df dt declines is proportional to the remaining infiltration capacity f0 f the original horton equation was given as follows 1 f t f c f 0 f c e k t where f0 is the initial value of infiltration capacity mm h at the beginning of rainfall k is the soil specific decay constant the horton infiltration capacity time curve was proposed to simulate the variation of infiltration capacity with time during continuous rainfall events however the reduction of infiltration capacity is mainly caused by increasing soil moisture both the initial and stable infiltration capacities are also highly related to soil moisture the initial infiltration capacity approaches infinity if the antecedent soil moisture is very dry while it approaches a stable constant value if the soil is saturated however numerous other factors in addition to rainfall such as irrigation overland flow evapotranspiration are also able to vary soil moisture and thus inevitably affect infiltration capacity furthermore the infiltration capacity cannot be precisely determined from the horton equation when the rainfall intensity is less than the infiltration capacity or the rainfall stops all of these issues restrict the application of the horton equation in infiltration and runoff simulations due to the intermittent nature of rainfall therefore soil moisture θ at time t should be incorporated into the horton equation experimental observations have shown that soil moisture changes with time fig 2 follow a power function relationship of the form 2 θ θ 0 θ c θ 0 1 t n where θ0 and θc are the initial and saturated soil moisture respectively n is the power exponent which is greater than zero therefore t can be derived as 3 t 1 θ θ 0 θ c θ 1 n 1 equation 3 can be expanded by the taylor series method as 4 t j 1 i 1 j 1 n i 1 j θ θ 0 θ c θ j thus eq 1 can be written as 5 f θ f c f 0 f c e k j 1 i 1 j 1 n i 1 j θ θ 0 θ c θ j equation 5 is an improved form of the horton equation that incorporates the relationship between the infiltration capacity and soil moisture furthermore the upper and lower boundaries of soil moisture θc and θ0 can be applied to test the variation ranges of infiltration capacity 6 lim θ θ 0 f c f 0 f c e k j 1 i 1 j 1 n i 1 j θ θ 0 θ c θ j f 0 7 lim θ θ c f c f 0 f c e k j 1 i 1 j 1 n i 1 j θ θ 0 θ c θ j f c the infiltration capacity approaches the initial infiltration capacity f0 if θ θ0 eq 6 while it approaches a stable constant fc if θ θc eq 7 therefore the improved horton equation produces infiltration capacity that varies with soil moisture in our study the improved horton equation eq 5 was simplified by setting j to 1 and was validated by experimental observations therefore the simplified equation is given as follows 8 f θ f c f 0 f c e k n θ θ 0 θ c θ f c f 0 f c e k θ θ 0 θ c θ where k is the soil specific decay parameter of the improved horton equation overland flow observations were used to validate the simulation performance of the improved horton equation because the infiltration process is usually difficult to observe the overland flow simulation is derived as follow 9 r θ p e t f θ p e t f c f 0 f c e k θ θ 0 θ c θ where r θ is the total overland flow mm h p and et are the rainfall and evapotranspiration rates mm h for the runoff event simulation et can be ignored due to the short duration of the event 3 2 model calibration and validation the observations of numerous rainfall runoff events were compared with those of the horton equation and the improved horton equation to determine if improvement in overland flow simulation had been achieved by the improved horton equation both the improved and original horton equations were auto calibrated by the monte carlo method and the calibrated parameters for f0 fc and k for the horton equation and f0 fc and k for the improved horton equation are shown in table 2 three statistical criteria were used to assess the simulation performance nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r 2 and volume error ve the equations are given as follows 10 nse 1 q obs i q sim i 2 q obs i q obs 2 11 r 2 q obs i q obs q sim i q sim 2 q obs i q obs 2 q sim i q sim 2 12 ve q sim q obs q obs 100 where qobs i and qsim i are the i th observed and simulated overland flow mm h q obs and q sim are the average observed and simulated overland flow mm h greater nse or r 2 values mean better simulation performance and the optimal value is one moreover the optimal value of ve is zero and ve values close to zero indicate better simulation performance in our study if the nse and r2 values were greater than 0 60 and 0 80 respectively and the ve values were within 15 the simulation performance was considered good if the nse and r2 values were greater than 0 80 and 0 90 respectively and the ve values were within 10 the simulation performance considered very good these three criteria were aggregated into one objective parameter e as 13 e nse r 2 2 v e values of e can range from to 1 with the optimal value being 1 twenty cross validations were performed by randomly dividing all the observations from the 32 experiments into calibration 22 experiments and validation 10 experiments observations for each cross validation five thousand iterations were implemented by the monte carlo method 3 3 model uncertainty estimation the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method glue was used to estimate the uncertainties of both the original and the improved horton equation the uncertainty results were compared to verify the reliability of simulation performance in addition to nse two other statistical criteria were used for uncertainty estimation average relative interval length at the 95 confidence level aril and the percentage of observations falling within the 95 confidence interval p 95ci jin et al 2010 li et al 2010 zhang and shao 2018 14 aril 1 n t 1 n q sim 97 5 t q sim 2 5 t q obs t 100 15 p 95 c i n o in n 100 where qsim 97 5 and qsim 2 5 are the 97 5th and the 2 5th percentages of behavioral groups of the overland flow simulation series mm h noin is the number of observations which fell within the 95 confidence interval smaller aril values indicate that uncertainty intervals are narrower and larger values of p 95ci indicate that uncertainty intervals are more reliable five thousand iterations were implemented by the monte carlo method for each experiment if the nse was greater than 0 60 the corresponding parameter sets were considered to be behavioral for uncertainty estimation otherwise the parameter sets were considered to be non behavioral 4 results 4 1 experimental observations of variable infiltration the variations in infiltration rate under different soil moisture conditions are shown in fig 3 a the infiltration rate was observed to decline nonlinearly as soil moisture increased considering the data from all 32 experiments infiltration rate decreased from 120 mm h to 30 mm h while soil moisture increased from 0 27 to 0 44 m3 m3 at the initial stage of each experiment due to the low soil moisture condition the infiltration rate rapidly declined from 100 to 40 mm h as the soil moisture increased from 0 27 to 0 38 m3 m3 the decline was more apparent when the antecedent soil moisture was dry e g 0 22 0 26 m3 m3 fig 3b the relative change of infiltration rate became smaller and smaller as soil moisture increased particularly when soil moisture was greater than 0 38 m3 m3 the infiltration rate eventually approached the stable infiltration capacity i e 25 35 mm h as the soil gradually became saturated i e 0 40 0 44 m3 m3 the overall relationship between infiltration rate and soil moisture for all of the data collected was fitted by equation 8 and produced a coefficient of determination of 0 60 fig 3a since the antecedent soil moisture is a critical impact factor the experimental observations were divided into three groups according to the antecedent soil moisture i e 0 22 0 26 m3 m3 0 26 0 30 m3 m3 and 0 30 0 35 m3 m3 fig 3b the fitting performance increased for the antecedent soil moisture conditions of 0 22 0 26 m3 m3 and 0 26 0 30 m3 m3 r2 of 0 63 and 0 63 respectively compared with the fitting performance for all data combined however the fitting performance was somewhat worse r2 of 0 51 when the antecedent soil moisture was 0 30 0 35 m3 m3 although the fitting performance gradually became worse as antecedent soil moisture increased the fitting performance for all three groups was satisfactory therefore the improved horton equation was useful for reflecting the nonlinear relationship between infiltration rate and soil moisture 4 2 simulation performance for multiple experiments the simulations with the improved horton equation showed good agreement with the observations the cross validation results showed that all of the statistical criteria of simulation performance were considered very good in most of the experiments in both the calibration and validation data sets fig 4 the nse values ranged from 0 75 to 1 00 in most experiments in particular 75 00 of the total calibration experiments and 61 00 of the total validation experiments had nse values greater than 0 65 there were 73 86 of the total calibration experiments and 65 50 of the total validation experiments with r2 values greater than 0 90 the ve values in nearly 30 of total experiments were less than 2 5 there were 75 00 of the total calibration experiments and 63 50 of the total validation experiments with ve values of 10 furthermore the e values in nearly 50 of total experiments ranged from 0 80 to 0 90 for both the calibration and validation data sets there were 75 23 of the total calibration experiments and 63 50 of the total validation experiments with e values greater than 0 70 simulation performance by the improved horton equation was clearly improved compared with the original horton equation and the frequencies of the performance indices considered to be at the good and very good performance levels increased substantially particularly for nse and r2 the frequencies of nse values greater than 0 65 increased 11 59 and 2 50 for the calibration and validation data sets respectively the frequencies of r2 values greater than 0 90 increased 31 14 and 22 50 respectively the frequencies of ve values that were 10 did not change obviously and the frequencies of e values greater than 0 70 increased 10 91 and 4 50 respectively therefore the improved horton equation could better capture infiltration variation with time than the original horton equation for the individual experiment simulations by the cross validations there were 76 00 92 00 and 83 00 of the total simulations that were at the good or very good performance levels for nse r2 and ve respectively fig 5 when all three of these performance criteria were considered 71 00 of the total simulations were at the good or very good performance level the overland flow for experiments 2 6 7 12 13 15 18 22 24 27 31 was simulated very well with performance for over 80 of 20 cross validations at the good or very good performance level according to the values of nse r 2 and ve in these 17 experiments the antecedent soil moisture ranged from 0 222 to 0 349 m3 m3 and the rainfall intensity ranged from 68 4 to 171 mm h in particular the total cross validations for experiments 12 15 20 21 24 and 28 31 showed good simulation performance the best simulation performance was for experiment 30 very good with the best nse r2 and ve of 0 97 0 97 and 0 40 respectively however due to the larger ve and smaller nse the overland flow values for experiments 1 4 5 9 25 26 and 32 were not simulated well with performance for less than half of the 20 cross validations at the good or very good performance levels in particular the worst simulation was seen for experiment 9 antecedent soil moisture 0 260 m3 m3 rainfall intensity 91 2 mm h with only 10 0 of the total cross validations were good or very good and the worst nse r2 and ve were 0 95 0 84 and 34 25 respectively the simulation performance of the cross validation tests for individual experiments were also compared with those of the original horton equation except for experiments 1 5 16 23 25 27 and 32 the simulation performance statistics of most experiments 20 of 32 were noticeably improved for nse obvious improvements were seen for experiments 3 9 17 and 26 with average values increasing by over 50 obvious increases in r2 were seen for experiments 4 7 9 13 14 18 and 19 with average values increasing by nearly 10 the most obvious improvements in ve were observed for experiments 3 8 11 24 26 31 and 32 with average values decreasing by over 50 for the comprehensive simulation performance statistic e obvious improvements were observed for experiments 3 9 17 and 26 furthermore the percentage of total experiments with the very good performance rating increased from 5 to 80 for 20 out of 32 experiments 62 5 and only seven experiments 2 16 20 23 25 27 and 29 had percentages decrease slightly from 5 to 35 fig 6 a and c the percentage of total experiments with the good performance rating increased from 5 to 80 for 20 out of 32 experiments 62 5 and only six experiments 1 5 16 23 25 and 32 had percentages decrease slightly from 5 and 35 fig 6b and d therefore the obvious improvements mainly occurred for the experiments with lower rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture conditions such as experiments 3 and 9 4 3 uncertainty estimations the average relative interval length at the 95 confidence level aril in the 32 experiments ranged from 20 14 to 89 59 with an average value of 49 17 fig 7 the percentage of observations falling within the 95 confidence interval p 95ci ranged from 66 86 to 100 with an average value of 95 94 the observations which were outside of the confidence intervals were usually from the high overland flow conditions such as for experiments 7 8 11 and 26 the simulations for the rest of the experiments were much more reliable because over 95 of the total observations were within the uncertainty intervals though these intervals for experiments 1 2 4 5 10 14 16 19 21 and 30 were a little larger with the aril of over 50 however the simulations of experiments 7 and 8 were less reliable because only 66 86 and 77 01 of total observations were within the uncertainty intervals respectively the aril values from most of the simulations for the 32 experiments were much greater with the improved horton equation than with the original horton equation except for experiments 10 23 and 24 fig 8 the largest percentage increases were 27 66 25 84 and 21 71 for experiments 17 1 and 9 respectively also more observations for most experiments were within the uncertainty intervals with the improved horton equation than for the original horton equation except for experiments 8 11 18 19 23 24 26 28 29 and 31 the greatest changes were for the low overland flow situation such as observed in experiments 1 2 4 6 7 9 12 15 and 17 for the p 95ci the largest percentage increases were 52 94 for experiment 9 therefore the simulations for most experiments were more reliable with the improved horton equation than with the original horton equation and the most obvious improvements were for the low overland flow simulations 5 discussion soil infiltration is one of many complicated hydrological processes and is affected by rainfall intensity and duration soil moisture soil structure human activities e g irrigation tillage and so on mishra et al 2003 liu et al 2011 most previous studies have focused on the reduction of infiltration capacity with rainfall duration horton 1938 however the reduction of infiltration capacity is mainly the result of decreased capillary potential gradients and increased soil moisture rather than the increase of time huang et al 2013 yi and fan 2016 therefore the key issue to investigate is the relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture artificial rainfall experiments and numerical simulations are of great benefit to obtain accurate observations of rainfall rate infiltration rate and soil moisture under multiple controlled scenarios in order to determine rainfall infiltration relationships and the physical mechanisms that strongly influence them the nonlinear relationships between infiltration capacity and soil moisture were identified using experimental observations and those relationships obeyed the law of the natural exhaustion process horton 1941 that is the initial infiltration capacity is large because the soil is dry and the vertical hydraulic gradient is large as soil moisture increases the soil pore space is filled by water and thus both the vertical hydraulic gradient and the infiltration capacity decrease li et al 2010 the rate at which infiltration capacity decreases also gradually decreases finally the infiltration capacity approaches a stable constant value when the soil becomes saturated this relationship might provide a more reasonable and intuitive explanation that explicitly describes the physical mechanism of infiltration capacity variation with time whether or not rain occurs corradini et al 1997 chahinian et al 2005 such relationships are more easily used and observed because the condition of rainfall duration extended to infinity is replaced by the saturated soil condition therefore our study explored the nonlinear relationship between infiltration and soil moisture using controlled experiments and adopted this relationship to improve the infiltration simulation performance of the horton equation with consideration of soil moisture variation the validity of the relationship was verified by comparison of the simulation performance with the original horton equation the simulation performance of most of the 32 experiments with different rainfall intensities and antecedent soil moisture were improved when compared with those of the original horton equation particularly for the lower overland flow conditions or for the experiments with lower rainfall intensities and antecedent soil moisture for example for experiment 9 with antecedent soil moisture of 0 260 m3 m3 the average and maximum nse values increased from 0 21 to 0 16 and from 0 51 to 0 92 respectively among all of the cross validation tests furthermore the simulation performance was also compared with a previous study which was simulated using the short duration infiltration process model ship and using the same experimental system wang et al 2017 the ve and nse values indicated greater simulation accuracy for the improved horton equation than for ship for a given antecedent soil moisture for example the statistical criteria were greatly improved when the antecedent soil moisture was 0 26 the ve ranged from 3 26 to 2 72 for the improved horton equation and from 19 71 to 11 36 for the ship model the nse ranged from 0 90 to 0 96 for the improved horton equation and only from 0 52 to 0 86 for ship therefore the improved horton equation greatly benefits the continuous simulation of infiltration and overland flow particularly under water restricted conditions such as found in arid and semi arid regions however our study was only done with one soil type i e the sandy loam soil from the chaobai river basin china soil type directly determines the soil structure the water holding capacity and the variations of infiltration capacity li et al 2010 thus all of the parameters of both the original and improved horton equations are highly related to the soil types more experiments should be implemented by considering more soil types and the improved equation could be further tested moreover our improved horton equation still supported the hypothesis of the natural exhaustion process that follows a simple inverse exponential relationship horton 1941 both our improved horton equation and the original horton equation are semi empirical models that may possibly introduce more parameter uncertainties in the model structure than those of physically based models mishra et al 2003 chahinian et al 2005 for example although most experimental observations fell within the uncertainty intervals the average relative interval length was from 20 14 to 89 59 additionally the simplified equations still have a challenge in describing the variations of infiltration capacity or soil moisture with time such as is done with exponential and power functions horton 1941 hayek 2018 the power function was adopted in our study for the soil moisture time curves due to its simplicity further studies could be implemented to compare the relative performance of the power function compared with the exponential function and their combination for simulating variable infiltration 6 conclusions soil water infiltration is one of the critical hydrological processes and its simulation is still difficult in hydrological cycle modelling due to soil spatial heterogeneity and complicated soil structure in our study both an artificial rainfall experiment and numerical simulation were used to investigate the relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture the results showed that 1 infiltration capacity decreases nonlinearly as soil moisture increased and approached a stable infiltration capacity as the soil became saturated the power function fit the soil moisture time curve data and was adopted to describe the nonlinear relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture the fitting performance for all 32 rainfall simulation experiments was good with coefficients of determination greater than 0 50 particularly for the low antecedent soil moisture conditions 2 compared with the simulation performance of the original horton equation the simulation performance of the improved horton equation was much better particularly with respect to nse and r 2 for the improved horton equation there were 75 00 of the total calibration experiments and 61 00 of the total validation experiments with nse values greater than 0 65 there were 73 86 of the total calibration experiments and 65 50 of the total validation experiments with r2 values greater than 0 90 for the original horton equation only 63 41 of the nse values in the calibration data set and 58 50 of the nse values in the validation data set were greater than 0 65 additionally 42 73 of the r2 values in the calibration data set and 43 00 of the r2 values in the validation data set were greater than 0 90 the greatest improvements with the improved horton equation were for the experiments with lower rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture 3 the uncertainty intervals of the improved horton equation became a little greater than those of the original horton equation for all 32 rainfall simulation experiments the average relative interval lengths at the 95 confidence level were 49 17 and 40 52 using the improved and original horton equations respectively however the percentage of observations falling within the 95 confidence interval increased greatly from 92 13 to 95 94 most of the observations could be captured using the improved horton equation and the greatest improvements were for the low overland flow simulations for each experiment the nonlinear relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture used in this study greatly improved the simulation performance of the horton equation however all of these simulations were implemented using experimental observations at the soil cube scale and only one soil type was used further

5491,in this study we investigated the impact of climate change on nutrient loading in the cannonsville reservoir watershed of the new york city nyc water supply system where management practices have reduced nutrient inputs in the last 25 years a modified version of the swat hydrological and water quality model swat hs that had been previously tested and verified for streamflow and phosphorus for this watershed was calibrated for nitrate to estimate contributions from point and nonpoint sources model simulations show that forests that occupy 64 of the watershed area contribute the greatest proportion of nitrate at 39 while pastures that are in close proximity to streams and runoff generating areas contribute the greatest proportion of total nitrogen at 34 point sources contribute less than 5 of the annual nitrate load stream export accounts for only about 23 of the annual total n input to the watershed from anthropogenic sources suggesting significant storage or loss from the landscape we assumed stationary land use and management practices to assess the change in nutrient loading from baseline 2001 2010 to middle of the century 2051 2060 period due to a change in climate results indicated no change to moderate increase in the annual loading of dissolved forms of nutrients n and p whereas particulate forms of nutrients and sediment loadings are projected to increase due to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of large storm events a seasonal shift in streamflow due to warmer winter temperatures greater amounts of precipitation falling as rain and earlier melting of snowpack may play an important role in controlling the seasonal pattern of nutrient loading the methodology used in this study can be adapted in other watersheds to estimate the relative

the highest proportion of agricultural land among 19 reservoirs in the nyc water supply system in the past the cannonsville reservoir experienced eutrophic conditions in the summer time effler and

when compared to the period before the implementation of watershed management programs 1990s these results are consistent with the observed reduction in dissolved p concentrations in streamflow in contrast the annual particulate p and annual streamflow have not declined similar conclusions were drawn by hoang et al 2019 through water quality data analysis and swat hs simulations of streamflow

2051 2060 period due to a change in climate the specific objectives of this study are i to simulate terrestrial n loading in the cannonsville watershed and to estimate and partition contributions from major point and nonpoint sources and ii to simulate the impact of climate change on n p and suspended sediment loading 2 methods 2 1 study area the cannonsville reservoir is located in delaware county new york in the catskill mountains about 100 miles northwest of new york city the reservoir is primarily used as a drinking water supply for new york city and to augment flow for the downstream portion of the delaware river cannonsville reservoir has a contributing watershed area of 1178 km2 elevation of the watershed ranges from 300 m to 1000 m above mean sea level climate in this watershed is humid with mean annual temperature of 8 c and mean annual precipitation of 1120 mm dominant land use is forest 64 followed by agriculture 19 shrubland 10 residential areas 5 and waterbodies 2 dairy farming is the main agricultural activity which also includes pasture and corn and hay production the main tributary draining an area of 912 km2 is the west branch of the delaware river wbdr fixed frequency and storm event water quality sampling data collected along the wbdr at beerston ny 8 km downstream of the walton usgs flow gage fig 1 has been used to estimate stream nutrient loads longabucco and rafferty 1998 2 2 swat hs model set up saturation excess has been identified as the dominant runoff generation process in nyc watersheds walter et al 2000 swat hs is a modified version of the swat model capable of simulating saturation excess runoff in this study we extended the swat hs model hoang et al 2019 that was previously set up for this watershed for streamflow and p loading to include simulation of nitrogen the model setup involved dividing the cannonsville watershed into 14 sub basins using a 10 m digital elevation model dem soil properties from the soil survey geographic ssurgo database usda nrcs 2012 and land use information from the classified 2009 aerial photography from nyc dep were used a total of 1123 hydrologic response units hrus each a unique combination of topographic soils and land use information were used additional details on the swat hs model can be found in hoang et al 2017 and hoang et al 2019 precipitation and air temperature data required as input to the model were obtained from the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism climate data daly et al 2008 the mountain microclimate simulation model mt clim hungerford et al 1989 was used to estimate relative humidity from air temperature data solar radiation was input by averaging data from the albany and binghamton airports for wind speed the swat built in weather generator was used 2 3 sources of stream nutrients streams in the cannonsville watershed receive point and nonpoint sources of nutrients in both particulate and dissolved forms point sources include five publicly owned wwtps and two industrial sources total p from these seven point sources has reduced significantly from about 12 000 kg year in early 1990s to less than 200 kg year at present in the case of total n the reduction is from about 27 000 kg year during 1990 2002 to about 17 000 kg year since 2003 the measured monthly loads of nutrients from wwtps were used as point source inputs in the model nonpoint sources of nutrients simulated in the model include fertilizer and manure applied to croplands manure deposited by cattle atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and septic systems details on fertilizer and manure input can be found in hoang et al 2019 the average annual rates of atmospheric deposition for nh4 and no3 in precipitation 0 19 and 1 0 mg l 1 respectively and dry deposition 0 46 kg nh4 ha 1 and 0 18 kg no3 ha 1 were obtained from clean air status and trends network data for claryville ny castnet 2018 atmospheric deposition of n has shown a decreasing trend in the region gilliam et al 2019 in swat septic systems are simulated using a biozone algorithm jeong et al 2011 a total of 5576 septic systems were included in the model setup based on information from the delaware and schoharie county tax parcel maps a gis layer of the septic systems was converted to a raster with a grid size of 10 m by 10 m to represent the average size of a drainfield 100 m2 the septic raster was then merged with the land use map and defined as a septic land use in the final land use map due to the relatively small percentage of the subbasin area that septic drainfields cover the septic land use was added as a threshold exempt land use when hrus were created we assumed an average of 2 5 permanent residents in a household the average annual anthropogenic sources of total n input in the swat model for the period 2001 2010 is shown in table 1 2 4 model calibration for nitrogen calibration and model performance for streamflow dissolved p particulate p and suspended sediment are described in hoang et al 2019 nitrate calibration was carried out using the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup calibration software abbaspour 2013 the nitrate load calibration and validation periods are 2001 2006 and 2007 2010 respectively six nitrate related parameters table 2 were calibrated by conducting 1000 simulations a parameter set for each simulation was generated using a latin hypercube sampling procedure which reduces the number of simulations required for calibration compared to a random sampling procedure the best parameter set table 2 based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the objective function was selected as the final parameter set used for simulating scenarios of historical 2001 2010 and future 2051 2060 nitrate loads model performance was evaluated using standard metrics including coefficient of determination r2 nse and kling gupta efficiency kge the r2 that describes the collinearity between simulated and measured data ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating less error variance the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line values of nse ranging from 0 to 1 are considered acceptable with higher values indicating better model performance the kge gupta et al 2009 which is less sensitive to high values provides a better estimate of model predictions at all ranges of flows a value of 1 indicates perfect model fit simulations of the calibrated model with and without wwtp input and keeping septic systems active and inactive were used to estimate the contribution from these sources to the total nitrate load at the watershed outlet for climate change scenarios wwtp input was not considered as their contributions in the future is unknown and due to the fact that these contributions have reduced significantly in recent years 2 5 future climate scenarios climate scenarios for the mid century period 2051 2060 from the multivariate adaptive constructed analog maca dataset abatzoglou and brown 2012 a statistical downscaling method that improves the coarse resolution several 100 km of the raw gcm output to a 4 km grid using meteorological observations http www climatologylab org maca html were used the downscaled future climate variables air temperature precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation for the grid point nearest to the centroid of the cannonsville watershed was used as inputs to the model a secondary bias correction on the maca data was performed to account for uncertainty in future climate projections resulting from complex local topography and errors in historical observations used in the primary bias correction gelda et al 2019 a total of 20 cmip5 gcms based on rcp 8 5 worst case emission scenario for the mid century period 2051 2060 were considered in the analysis projected average annual change is air temperature for the watershed is between 1 4 c and 4 7 c with an average change of 3 0 c and projected average change in precipitation is between 2 0 to 17 8 with an average change of 5 5 simulated streamflow and water quality parameters dissolved p total p suspended sediment nitrate and total n for the future period 2051 2060 were compared to historical period 2001 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat hs simulation of streamflow and nutrients using observed climate the calibrated model simulated streamflow and water quality parameters satisfactorily table 4 model performance statistics for streamflow dissolved p and total p are reported in our earlier work hoang et al 2019 a comparison of simulated and observed nitrate loads shows that the model under predicted the peak values although the seasonal pattern was captured well fig 3 in general the model performance for water quality was better during the calibration period compared to the validation period 3 2 sources of stream nitrogen simulated contribution of n from point and nonpoint sources by swat hs for the historical period is presented in table 5 swat hs estimated loadings are within reported estimates of nitrate and total nitrogen export for watersheds in the northeastern us alexander et al 2002 forests contribute the greatest proportion of nitrate indicating the importance of biogeochemical processes in the largest land use 60 watershed area pastures contribute the greatest proportion of total n indicating the influence of erosional processes and transport of n attached to sediment close proximity of pastures to streams and runoff generating areas contribute to high total nitrogen loading which is well represented in the swat hs model simulations with and without septic systems indicate that septic systems contribute about 6 of the average annual nitrate loading estimated contribution of wwtps is less than 5 of average annual stream nitrate loading although atmospheric deposition is the single largest contributor of anthropogenic terrestrial nitrogen input annually its direct impact on stream nitrogen is unclear this may be due to the relatively larger pool of nitrogen in soils johnson 2013 reported an average of 3 95 mg ha of nitrogen in forest soils in the catskills region which is the equivalent of 400 years of atmospheric deposition at the current rate of 0 01 mg ha yr n table 1 our modeling analysis also show that stream export accounts for only about 23 of the annual total n input to the watershed from anthropogenic sources this implies that a significant fraction of the annual input of n is either stored in the watershed in soils vegetation and groundwater or lost through denitrification van breemen et al 2002 estimated that as much as 51 of annual n input in northeastern us watersheds is lost through denitrification boyer et al 2002 who studied the relationship between anthropogenic nitrogen sources and riverine export in several watersheds in northeastern us using a mass balance approach concluded that only 32 of total input n is exported by streams in the delaware river basin within which the cannonsville watershed is located their estimated fraction of n exported for the entire northeastern us was in the range of 11 40 with an area weighted mean of 25 3 3 future climate impact on nutrient loading simulations of swat hs using future climate scenarios show an increase in the annual loading of suspended sediment total p and total n compared to the historical period considered in this study fig 4 b d the interquartile range of historical and future scenarios of sediment and total nutrients do not overlap indicating that the annual loading of these constituents will be higher in the future period considered fig 5 indicates that the projected increase in loading of total nutrients is due to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of large storm events that carry a disproportionate amount of sediment and transport particulate forms of n and p with it a comparison of storm events where the simulated flow at the walton station was above 200 m3s 1 approximately the bankfull discharge showed that such events are projected to increase from 5 2 events every 10 years under historical climate to an average of 7 4 events every 10 years under future climate based on 20 gcms fig 5a this is similar to a once in 2 yr event becoming a once in 1 4 yr event the magnitude of the largest event during a 10 year period is also projected to increase in the future fig 5b such changes are consistent with horton et al 2014b who reported a large projected increase in the frequency intensity and duration of extreme precipitation events in the region a combination of changes in the frequency and magnitude of large events is predicted to increase the average annual sediment loading by over 100 and total nutrient loading to increase by 50 n and 56 p respectively it is also noted that the uncertainty in the sediment and total nutrient loading interquartile range also increase under future scenarios fig 4b d the loading of dissolved p and nitrate are projected to remain the same or increase moderately under most scenarios fig 4e f in the case of dissolved nutrients the interquartile ranges of historical and future scenarios show overlap unlike particulate forms dissolved forms of nutrients are more related to the seasonality of streamflow and input from management practices within the watershed assumed constant in this study and therefore less influenced by changes in the number of large streamflow events the change in average annual dissolved p loading is between 21 to 35 with a mean and median change of 5 2 and 2 4 respectively average annual nitrate loading is projected to change between 19 to 42 with a mean and median change of 4 8 and 2 4 respectively these finding are comparable to an earlier analysis in the same watershed that projected 3 to 44 increase for dissolved nutrients using three gcms for the 2045 2065 period nyc dep 2013 our results on nutrient loading under future scenarios are generally similar to the findings of shrestha et al 2012 in the lake winnipeg watershed in canada where streamflows are also projected to increase these results are in contrast with sites where streamflows are projected to decrease causing sediment and total nutrient loads not to increase although dissolved forms may increase ahmadi et al 2014 implying the influence of temperature changes on the form of nutrients exported by watersheds the impact of future changes in temperature alone on nutrient loading needs further investigation 3 4 impact of seasonality in streamflow although the average annual streamflows are projected to increase moderately with a median increase of 4 4 fig 4a and a mean increase of 7 6 a major shift in the seasonality of streamflow is projected fig 6 a this shift is consistent with other studies in the region discussed in the introductory section projected direction of change in streamflow is generally consistent among gcms except for three gcms gcm 11 17 18 in table 3 that show a decrease in average annual streamflow due to increased projected temperatures without significant increase in precipitation use of multiple gcms clearly has the benefit compared to a few gcms that may not cover the entire range of possible future climate and to more accurately account for the uncertainty in gcms the magnitude of projected change in average annual streamflow ranged between 11 to 28 changes in hydrology clearly play an important role in controlling the seasonal pattern of nutrient loading warmer winter temperatures greater amounts of precipitation falling as rain and earlier melting of snowpack result in a seasonal shift in streamflow and consequently in nutrient loading fig 6b f the impact of seasonality in streamflow appears more pronounced for dissolved p and nitrate loading than for total p and total n for which large storm events play a more important role 4 summary and conclusions this study presents a modeling analysis of water quality in the cannonsville watershed that is part of the nyc water supply system the first part of the study involved simulating terrestrial nitrogen loading and estimating and partitioning the relative proportion of point and nonpoint sources of stream nitrogen in the watershed using the swat hs model calibrated model simulations showed that forest land use that occupies 64 of the watershed area contributed the most to nitrate loading and pasture land use contributed the most to total n loading due to close proximity to streams and runoff generating areas causing high loads of n being transported with sediment nonpoint sources in general contribute about 95 of the nitrate exported from the watershed model simulations also indicate that only about 23 of the total annual anthropogenic n input atmospheric deposition fertilizers and manure septic systems wwtps is exported out of the watershed by streams suggesting significant storage and or loss of n within the watershed while monitoring the watershed outlet can provide information on total nutrient and sediment export from a watershed models allow breakdown of contributions from various watershed sources and their relative importance such information can be valuable for watershed management plans as sources and their relative contributions vary among watersheds swat hs simulations using future climate from 20 gcms indicated that average annual loading of dissolved forms of nutrients n and p will have no change or moderate increase under future climate in contrast loading of particulate forms of nutrients and sediment are projected to increase due to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of large storm events that transport a disproportionate amount of nutrients associated with sediments into the streams although large events have occurred in the past june 2006 august september 2011 a long term impact on reservoir water quality due to excess nutrients from these events has not occurred in the case of phosphorus the observed decreasing trend in soil p values over the past 20 years dewing personal communication in several farms in the watershed is promising reduction in p input due to changes in management practices over the years is expected to result in a long term watershed response that attenuates the contribution of p in runoff a shift in the timing of peak spring runoff towards earlier in the year due to warming winter temperatures greater proportion of precipitation falling as rain and earlier melting of snowpack may also shift the seasonal pattern of nutrient loading also highlighted is the need for using a large number of gcms in climate change impact assessment studies climate projections should capture a wide range of possible future climates given the model uncertainty particularly in the amount of precipitation estimated funding this work was partially funded by

2051 2060 period due to a change in climate the specific objectives of this study are i to simulate terrestrial n loading in the cannonsville watershed and to estimate and partition contributions from major point and nonpoint sources and ii to simulate the impact of climate change on n p and suspended sediment loading 2 methods 2 1 study area the cannonsville reservoir is located in delaware county new york in the catskill mountains about 100 miles northwest of new york city the reservoir is primarily used as a drinking water supply for new york city and to augment flow for the downstream portion of the delaware river cannonsville reservoir has a contributing watershed area of 1178 km2 elevation of the watershed ranges from 300 m to 1000 m above mean sea level climate in this watershed is humid with mean annual temperature of 8 c and mean annual precipitation of 1120 mm dominant land use is forest 64 followed by agriculture 19 shrubland 10 residential areas 5 and waterbodies 2 dairy farming is the main agricultural activity which also includes pasture and corn and hay production the main tributary draining an area of 912 km2 is the west branch of the delaware river wbdr fixed frequency and storm event water quality sampling data collected along the wbdr at beerston ny 8 km downstream of the walton usgs flow gage fig 1 has been used to estimate stream nutrient loads longabucco and rafferty 1998 2 2 swat hs model set up saturation excess has been identified as the dominant runoff generation process in nyc watersheds walter et al 2000 swat hs is a modified version of the swat model capable of simulating saturation excess runoff in this study we extended the swat hs model hoang et al 2019 that was previously set up for this watershed for streamflow and p loading to include simulation of nitrogen the model setup involved dividing the cannonsville watershed into 14 sub basins using a 10 m digital elevation model dem soil properties from the soil survey geographic ssurgo database usda nrcs 2012 and land use information from the classified 2009 aerial photography from nyc dep were used a total of 1123 hydrologic response units hrus each a unique combination of topographic soils and land use information were used additional details on the swat hs model can be found in hoang et al 2017 and hoang et al 2019 precipitation and air temperature data required as input to the model were obtained from the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism climate data daly et al 2008 the mountain microclimate simulation model mt clim hungerford et al 1989 was used to estimate relative humidity from air temperature data solar radiation was input by averaging data from the albany and binghamton airports for wind speed the swat built in weather generator was used 2 3 sources of stream nutrients streams in the cannonsville watershed receive point and nonpoint sources of nutrients in both particulate and dissolved forms point sources include five publicly owned wwtps and two industrial sources total p from these seven point sources has reduced significantly from about 12 000 kg year in early 1990s to less than 200 kg year at present in the case of total n the reduction is from about 27 000 kg year during 1990 2002 to about 17 000 kg year since 2003 the measured monthly loads of nutrients from wwtps were used as point source inputs in the model nonpoint sources of nutrients simulated in the model include fertilizer and manure applied to croplands manure deposited by cattle atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and septic systems details on fertilizer and manure input can be found in hoang et al 2019 the average annual rates of atmospheric deposition for nh4 and no3 in precipitation 0 19 and 1 0 mg l 1 respectively and dry deposition 0 46 kg nh4 ha 1 and 0 18 kg no3 ha 1 were obtained from clean air status and trends network data for claryville ny castnet 2018 atmospheric deposition of n has shown a decreasing trend in the region gilliam et al 2019 in swat septic systems are simulated using a biozone algorithm jeong et al 2011 a total of 5576 septic systems were included in the model setup based on information from the delaware and schoharie county tax parcel maps a gis layer of the septic systems was converted to a raster with a grid size of 10 m by 10 m to represent the average size of a drainfield 100 m2 the septic raster was then merged with the land use map and defined as a septic land use in the final land use map due to the relatively small percentage of the subbasin area that septic drainfields cover the septic land use was added as a threshold exempt land use when hrus were created we assumed an average of 2 5 permanent residents in a household the average annual anthropogenic sources of total n input in the swat model for the period 2001 2010 is shown in table 1 2 4 model calibration for nitrogen calibration and model performance for streamflow dissolved p particulate p and suspended sediment are described in hoang et al 2019 nitrate calibration was carried out using the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup calibration software abbaspour 2013 the nitrate load calibration and validation periods are 2001 2006 and 2007 2010 respectively six nitrate related parameters table 2 were calibrated by conducting 1000 simulations a parameter set for each simulation was generated using a latin hypercube sampling procedure which reduces the number of simulations required for calibration compared to a random sampling procedure the best parameter set table 2 based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the objective function was selected as the final parameter set used for simulating scenarios of historical 2001 2010 and future 2051 2060 nitrate loads model performance was evaluated using standard metrics including coefficient of determination r2 nse and kling gupta efficiency kge the r2 that describes the collinearity between simulated and measured data ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating less error variance the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line values of nse ranging from 0 to 1 are considered acceptable with higher values indicating better model performance the kge gupta et al 2009 which is less sensitive to high values provides a better estimate of model predictions at all ranges of flows a value of 1 indicates perfect model fit simulations of the calibrated model with and without wwtp input and keeping septic systems active and inactive were used to estimate the contribution from these sources to the total nitrate load at the watershed outlet for climate change scenarios wwtp input was not considered as their contributions in the future is unknown and due to the fact that these contributions have reduced significantly in recent years 2 5 future climate scenarios climate scenarios for the mid century period 2051 2060 from the multivariate adaptive constructed analog maca dataset abatzoglou and brown 2012 a statistical downscaling method that improves the coarse resolution several 100 km of the raw gcm output to a 4 km grid using meteorological observations http www climatologylab org maca html were used the downscaled future climate variables air temperature precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation for the grid point nearest to the centroid of the cannonsville watershed was used as inputs to the model a secondary bias correction on the maca data was performed to account for uncertainty in future climate projections resulting from complex local topography and errors in historical observations used in the primary bias correction gelda et al 2019 a total of 20 cmip5 gcms based on rcp 8 5 worst case emission scenario for the mid century period 2051 2060 were considered in the analysis projected average annual change is air temperature for the watershed is between 1 4 c and 4 7 c with an average change of 3 0 c and projected average change in precipitation is between 2 0 to 17 8 with an average change of 5 5 simulated streamflow and water quality parameters dissolved p total p suspended sediment nitrate and total n for the future period 2051 2060 were compared to historical period 2001 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat hs simulation of streamflow and nutrients using observed climate the calibrated model simulated streamflow and water quality parameters satisfactorily table 4 model performance statistics for streamflow dissolved p and total p are reported in our earlier work hoang et al 2019 a comparison of simulated and observed nitrate loads shows that the model under predicted the peak values although the seasonal pattern was captured well fig 3 in general the model performance for water quality was better during the calibration period compared to the validation period 3 2 sources of stream nitrogen simulated contribution of n from point and nonpoint sources by swat hs for the historical period is presented in table 5 swat hs estimated loadings are within reported estimates of nitrate and total nitrogen export for watersheds in the northeastern us alexander et al 2002 forests contribute the greatest proportion of nitrate indicating the importance of biogeochemical processes in the largest land use 60 watershed area pastures contribute the greatest proportion of total n indicating the influence of erosional processes and transport of n attached to sediment close proximity of pastures to streams and runoff generating areas contribute to high total nitrogen loading which is well represented in the swat hs model simulations with and without septic systems indicate that septic systems contribute about 6 of the average annual nitrate loading estimated contribution of wwtps is less than 5 of average annual stream nitrate loading although atmospheric deposition is the single largest contributor of anthropogenic terrestrial nitrogen input annually its direct impact on stream nitrogen is unclear this may be due to the relatively larger pool of nitrogen in soils johnson 2013 reported an average of 3 95 mg ha of nitrogen in forest soils in the catskills region which is the equivalent of 400 years of atmospheric deposition at the current rate of 0 01 mg ha yr n table 1 our modeling analysis also show that stream export accounts for only about 23 of the annual total n input to the watershed from anthropogenic sources this implies that a significant fraction of the annual input of n is either stored in the watershed in soils vegetation and groundwater or lost through denitrification van breemen et al 2002 estimated that as much as 51 of annual n input in northeastern us watersheds is lost through denitrification boyer et al 2002 who studied the relationship between anthropogenic nitrogen sources and riverine export in several watersheds in northeastern us using a mass balance approach concluded that only 32 of total input n is exported by streams in the delaware river basin within which the cannonsville watershed is located their estimated fraction of n exported for the entire northeastern us was in the range of 11 40 with an area weighted mean of 25 3 3 future climate impact on nutrient loading simulations of swat hs using future climate scenarios show an increase in the annual loading of suspended sediment total p and total n compared to the historical period considered in this study fig 4 b d the interquartile range of historical and future scenarios of sediment and total nutrients do not overlap indicating that the annual loading of these constituents will be higher in the future period considered fig 5 indicates that the projected increase in loading of total nutrients is due to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of large storm events that carry a disproportionate amount of sediment and transport particulate forms of n and p with it a comparison of storm events where the simulated flow at the walton station was above 200 m3s 1 approximately the bankfull discharge showed that such events are projected to increase from 5 2 events every 10 years under historical climate to an average of 7 4 events every 10 years under future climate based on 20 gcms fig 5a this is similar to a once in 2 yr event becoming a once in 1 4 yr event the magnitude of the largest event during a 10 year period is also projected to increase in the future fig 5b such changes are consistent with horton et al 2014b who reported a large projected increase in the frequency intensity and duration of extreme precipitation events in the region a combination of changes in the frequency and magnitude of large events is predicted to increase the average annual sediment loading by over 100 and total nutrient loading to increase by 50 n and 56 p respectively it is also noted that the uncertainty in the sediment and total nutrient loading interquartile range also increase under future scenarios fig 4b d the loading of dissolved p and nitrate are projected to remain the same or increase moderately under most scenarios fig 4e f in the case of dissolved nutrients the interquartile ranges of historical and future scenarios show overlap unlike particulate forms dissolved forms of nutrients are more related to the seasonality of streamflow and input from management practices within the watershed assumed constant in this study and therefore less influenced by changes in the number of large streamflow events the change in average annual dissolved p loading is between 21 to 35 with a mean and median change of 5 2 and 2 4 respectively average annual nitrate loading is projected to change between 19 to 42 with a mean and median change of 4 8 and 2 4 respectively these finding are comparable to an earlier analysis in the same watershed that projected 3 to 44 increase for dissolved nutrients using three gcms for the 2045 2065 period nyc dep 2013 our results on nutrient loading under future scenarios are generally similar to the findings of shrestha et al 2012 in the lake winnipeg watershed in canada where streamflows are also projected to increase these results are in contrast with sites where streamflows are projected to decrease causing sediment and total nutrient loads not to increase although dissolved forms may increase ahmadi et al 2014 implying the influence of temperature changes on the form of nutrients exported by watersheds the impact of future changes in temperature alone on nutrient loading needs further investigation 3 4 impact of seasonality in streamflow although the average annual streamflows are projected to increase moderately with a median increase of 4 4 fig 4a and a mean increase of 7 6 a major shift in the seasonality of streamflow is projected fig 6 a this shift is consistent with other studies in the region discussed in the introductory section projected direction of change in streamflow is generally consistent among gcms except for three gcms gcm 11 17 18 in table 3 that show a decrease in average annual streamflow due to increased projected temperatures without significant increase in precipitation use of multiple gcms clearly has the benefit compared to a few gcms that may not cover the entire range of possible future climate and to more accurately account for the uncertainty in gcms the magnitude of projected change in average annual streamflow ranged between 11 to 28 changes in hydrology clearly play an important role in controlling the seasonal pattern of nutrient loading warmer winter temperatures greater amounts of precipitation falling as rain and earlier melting of snowpack result in a seasonal shift in streamflow and consequently in nutrient loading fig 6b f the impact of seasonality in streamflow appears more pronounced for dissolved p and nitrate loading than for total p and total n for which large storm events play a more important role 4 summary and conclusions this study presents a modeling analysis of water quality in the cannonsville watershed that is part of the nyc water supply system the first part of the study involved simulating terrestrial nitrogen loading and estimating and partitioning the relative proportion of point and nonpoint sources of stream nitrogen in the watershed using the swat hs model calibrated model simulations showed that forest land use that occupies 64 of the watershed area contributed the most to nitrate loading and pasture land use contributed the most to total n loading due to close proximity to streams and runoff generating areas causing high loads of n being transported with sediment nonpoint sources in general contribute about 95 of the nitrate exported from the watershed model simulations also indicate that only about 23 of the total annual anthropogenic n input atmospheric deposition fertilizers and manure septic systems wwtps is exported out of the watershed by streams suggesting significant storage and or loss of n within the watershed while monitoring the watershed outlet can provide information on total nutrient and sediment export from a watershed models allow breakdown of contributions from various watershed sources and their relative importance such information can be valuable for watershed management plans as sources and their relative contributions vary among watersheds swat hs simulations using future climate from 20 gcms indicated that average annual loading of dissolved forms of nutrients n and p will have no change or moderate increase under future climate in contrast loading of particulate forms of nutrients and sediment are projected to increase due to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of large storm events that transport a disproportionate amount of nutrients associated with sediments into the streams although large events have occurred in the past june 2006 august september 2011 a long term impact on reservoir water quality due to excess nutrients from these events has not occurred in the case of phosphorus the observed decreasing trend in soil p values over the past 20 years dewing personal communication in several farms in the watershed is promising reduction in p input due to changes in management practices over the years is expected to result in a long term watershed response that attenuates the contribution of p in runoff a shift in the timing of peak spring runoff towards earlier in the year due to warming winter temperatures greater proportion of precipitation falling as rain and earlier melting of snowpack may also shift the seasonal pattern of nutrient loading also highlighted is the need for using a large number of gcms in climate change impact assessment studies climate projections should capture a wide range of possible future climates given the model uncertainty particularly in the amount of precipitation estimated funding this work was partially funded by

5492,the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to tackle anthropic and climate changes impacts is becoming a priority in drought prone areas this study examines the capabilities of indigenous rainwater harvesting techniques rwht to be used as a viable solution for flood mitigation the study analyses the hydraulic performance of the most used micro catchment rwht in sub saharan regions in terms of flow peak reduction fpr and volume reduction vr at the field and basin scale parametrized hyetographs were built to replicate the extreme precipitations that strike sahelian countries during rainy seasons 2d hydrodynamic simulations showed that half moons placed with a staggered configuration s hm have the best performances in reducing runoff at the field scale s hm showed a remarkable fpr of 77 and a vr of 70 in case of extreme rainfall instead at the basin scale in which only 5 of the surface was treated 13 and 8 respectively for fpr and vr were obtained in addition the reduction of the runoff coefficient rc between the different configuration was analyzed the study critically evaluates hydraulic performances of the different techniques and shows how pitting practices cannot guarantee high performance in case of extreme precipitations these results will enrich the knowledge of the hydraulic behavior of rwht aspect marginally investigated in the scientific literature moreover this study presents the first scientific application of hec ras as a rainfall runoff model despite some limitations this model has the effective feature of using very high resolution topography as input for hydraulic simulations the results presented in this study should encourage stakeholders to upscale the use of rwht in order to lessen the flood hazard and land degradation that oppresses arid and semi arid areas keywords rainwater harvesting techniques extreme rainfall runoff hydraulic modelling flood mitigation arid and semi arid climate 1 introduction arid and semi arid asa regions worldwide are characterized by a climate with a low amount of rainfall concentrated during short rainy seasons in these areas the most used farming system is rainfed agriculture which is totally based on rainfall to grow crops to deal with the low amount of annual rainfall and extreme climatic uncertainty farmers have developed several agricultural techniques to harvest rainwater ammar et al 2016 during the past thirty years many authors have named these agricultural practices with different terms such as runoff water harvesting is the term used by salazar et al salazar and casanova 2011 rainwater harvesting practice vohland and barry 2009 or the novel term of climate smart agriculture csa technologies partey et al 2018 in this work the term rainwater harvesting techniques rwht adopted by biazin et al 2012 will be used rwht have been used in worldwide asa countries middle east china india americas and africa over the history but their use was put aside during the green revolution in which new technologies resulted more successful gould et al 2014 mekdaschi studer and liniger 2013 nowadays in the era characterized by climate changes cc the utilization of rainwater harvesting techniques is rediscovered as an adaptive behavior to cope with the increasing water scarcity and climate exacerbation mukheibir 2010 ray and simpson 2014 turton and ohlsson 1999 cc are considerably modifying the hydrology and the response of watersheds to extreme events focusing on sub saharan africa the hydrology of the sahelian strip has changed several times over the last 70 years different studies have found three distinct periods characterized by a specific hydrological behavior the first period can be extended from the installation of the first rain gauging stations middle of the last century to the end of the 1960 s in which rain fell abundantly with a constant pattern the second comprises the twenty year period 1970 1990 called the great drought characterized by a long deficit period the third period starts from the end of the 20th century and shows a slight increase in precipitation even if the annual total amount of precipitation almost reached the average of the entire recorded period rainfall events show a greater interannual variability that is leading to an exacerbation of rainstorms particularly the rainfall regime of the last twenty years is characterized by a smaller number of rainy days and a significant growth of the occurrence of extreme daily rainfall panthou et al 2014 this corresponds to an increase of hydrodynamic intensity in which the hydrological cycle is characterized by longer dry spells and higher precipitation intensity giorgi et al 2011 with the ongoing global warming this is one of the climate anomalies that is affecting african countries nowadays national centers for environmental information 2019 the higher frequency of extreme events tied with the incessant land cover changes are leading to severe floods aich et al 2015 2016 amogu et al 2015 descroix et al 2012a b mahé and paturel 2009 recent studied highlighted how the frequency of flooding events is greatly increased in the last twenty years and their occurrence will increase in following years tamagnone et al 2019 wilcox et al 2018 thus impelling is the necessity to develop policies and strategies concerning flood risk mitigation this study investigates hydraulic performances of rwht meaning the effectiveness in runoff reduction exploring their capability as non structural flood mitigation techniques the features of simplicity replicability efficiency adaptability and the low cost of implementation and maintenance make the use of rwht suitable in a wide range of contexts al seekh and mohammad 2009 moreover about 70 of the entire sub saharan population is employed in the agricultural sector and could potentially put their effort in spreading these techniques on a wider range of drylands rockström et al 2010 nowadays rwht are primarily used to increase soil water storage soil fertility and consequently crop yield walker et al 2005 many studies have analyzed the benefit in crop production provided by the adoption of these techniques hensley et al 2011 malley et al 2004 tabor 1995 zougmoré et al 2003 rwht have been used also to restore degraded land the functions of decreasing surface runoff reducing erosion of fertile topsoil and increasing infiltration are effective in contrasting the ongoing desertification in drought prone areas reij 2009 other studies have developed different techniques to identify suitable sites where the use of rwht could be successful adham et al 2016 ammar et al 2016 kahinda et al 2008 until now the concept of flood reduction coupled with rwht has been analyzed primarily in flood prone urban areas freni and liuzzo 2019 haider et al 2019 palla et al 2017 teston et al 2018 on the contrary few studies have investigated and evaluated the effect of rwht on runoff reduction in rural environments al seekh and mohammad 2009 and ali et al 2010 conducted tests on artificial runoff plots to directly measure the amount of runoff after rainstorms welderufael et al 2008 implemented a morin and cluff mc runoff model to investigate the rainfall runoff relationships on treated and non treated fields of dera ethiopia verbist et al 2009 combined on site measurements with the use of the software hydrus 2d to evaluate the effect of an infiltration trench on a hillside in chile the work presented here provides a quantitative assessment of the hydraulic performance of rwht through advanced hydraulic modelling expanding also the scale of the analysis from the farming field to a watershed scale different hydraulic simulations have been carried out to study firstly the performance of the most used micro catchment rainwater harvesting techniques mc rwht in terms of runoff reduction implementing a conceptual hydraulic model field scale secondly the flood mitigation assessment of a real watershed due to the addition of rwht basin scale the outcomes demonstrate how rwht are an efficient strategy to reduce runoff overflowing out of farm fields decreasing the amount of water that quickly is supplied to the receptor river during severe rainstorms several stakeholders could benefit from the original contribution of this study such as farmers countryside regional planners and governance to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies furthermore this is the first study in which a rainfall runoff model is implemented using the hydraulic software hec ras v 5 0 6 adopting precipitation as a boundary condition this software has been created as a hydraulic software and still presents some limitations in the transformation of precipitation in runoff despite these constraints the possibility to use measured hyetographs or forecast in an hydraulic freeware and considering future upgrades in which hydrological tools will be added open interesting opportunities for innovative hydrological hydraulic studies the structure of the paper has been organized into four parts the first part reports the materials such as data and topography and describes the methodologies used in this research the second part sets out results section three deals with discussions related to the outcomes in the last section conclusions and future perspectives are drawn 2 materials and methods in this paper a series of acronyms have been used and repeated therefore for clarity are summarized in table 1 the workflow followed in this work is schematized in fig 1 2 1 study area different rwht have been developed by indigenous farmers from asa regions all over the world in this study rwht mainly used in the african sahel have been analyzed the sahelian strip is located between the parallel 10 n and 17 n and includes from west to east big countries such as senegal mauritania mali burkina faso niger chad sudan fig 2 its climate is characterized by an annual pluviometry that range from about 100 mm at the north to 800 mm at the south ali and lebel 2009 it has an ecological dry season of 8 9 months and a rainfall pattern mainly concentrated in august the ongoing climate changes seem to provide more water availability in sahelian countries seidou 2018 but with a greater spatial and temporal variability that do not help populations to overcome water scarcity some studies showed that almost 50 of the annual rainfall amount falls in the occurrence of extremely short a few hours or less rainstorms with high intensity balme et al 2006 this type of climate provides vast opportunities for water harvesting 3 geometrical data 3 1 rwht technical specifications during the last thirty years different researchers have classified the rwht on the base of specific factors such as size location design etc water harvesting systems were classified by oweis et al oweis 1999 oweis et al 2001 and a detailed list of the most used was reported in the work of yazar and ali 2016 this study is focused on micro catchment rwht mic rwht commonly used in sub saharan countries biazin et al 2012 boers et al 1986 boers and ben asher 1982 mekdaschi studer and liniger 2013 they can be collected in four main categories related to the type of processing technique fig s1 the design of these systems varies depending on the place where the technique has been developed and consequently it is possible to find different technical features mekdaschi studer and liniger 2013 in this work the authors have analyzed 4 different techniques half moons planting pits hand dug trenches vallerani trenches following technical specifications reported in the global database on sustainable land management wocat 2019 which are displayed in table 2 4 topographic data the hydraulic analyses carried out in this work have used two different topographic data as input geometry firstly in order to schematize an agricultural field with and without rwht a conceptual hydraulic model was implemented using a series of artificial geometries these were built shaping the selected rwht on a plain square of 1 ha with a constant slope of 1 the four analyzed rwht have been modelled following two geometrical schemes a aligned framework and b staggered framework an unmodified plain square was kept as reference geometry to carry out comparisons between the different configurations all geometries have been manipulated using the processing tools of qgis qgis development team 2009 in this article the abbreviation listed in table 3 will be used to identify outcomes related to each simulated configuration geometrical scheme of the configurations is displayed in fig s2 and fig s3 see supplementary material secondly hydraulic simulations were carried out on a real watershed next to the village of touré niger the settlement is located along the left bank of the sirba river the main tributary of the middle niger river basin its inhabitants have been affected by floods several times during the last decades with important losses of houses cattle and goods fiorillo et al 2018 massazza et al 2019 the topography is represented by the digital surface model dsm of the riverine territory the dsm was elaborated during aerial surveys with a drone by belcore et al 2019 at the end of the wet season 2018 the dsm has a high level of resolution of 8 cm since the riverine territory is characterized by the presence of a series of gullies flowing into the river a hydrological analysis was carried out to delineate the watersheds that collect rainwater into each gully the elevation model of the widest basin 26 ha has been used to implement the hydraulic model on a real geometry successively the dsm of the basin was modified in order to simulate the presence of rwht on a farming area target agricultural fields highlighted in fig 3 about 5 of the whole watershed outcomes from the hydraulic model will be identified with the name original and modified respectively having as geometry input the unmodified dsm and the modified dsm 4 1 hydrological data hydraulic analyses carried out in this study focused on hydrometeorological extremes that are the causes of floods thus extreme and heavy rainfall have been chosen as inputs for hydraulic simulations following the results showed by panthou et al 2014 extreme rainfall for the analyzed study region corresponds to precipitation of 40 mm that occurs on average less than 2 5 times per year instead 20 mm was chosen as magnitude for heavy rainfalls with a yearly occurrence lesser of 10 times typically the evolution of these events can be associated to an organized convective system ocs in which the front of the convective cell brings the mayor part of the rain and it is followed by a stratiform trail mathon et al 2002 hyetographs produced by this convective system are organized in two well defined intervals a high intensity peak often with a duration lesser of an hour followed by a low intensity constant tail fig 4 the shape of ocs hyetograph lends itself well to being disaggregated and parameterized in order to obtain a reconstructed realistic hyetograph in order to obtain a realistic hyetograph for both extreme and heavy rainfall the 5 parameters model proposed by balme et al 2006 was chosen to create the inputs for the rainfall runoff model all parameters are related to the total event rainfall p and are calculated as follows where pc is the total precipitation of the convective part im is the maximum rainfall intensity ps is the total precipitation of the stratiform part dc is the duration convective of the convective part dt is the total duration of the rainfall event and is is the stratiform intensity the coefficients that were calibrated optimizing the efficiency of the parametrized hyetograph to simulate real precipitation events are a 0 89 b 0 08 c 2 1 d 0 53 and is 1 5 mm h the parametrized hyetographs for the two analyzed events are displayed in fig 5 in addition to simulate a real event on a real topography the hyetograph with the highest intensity of the wet season 2012 was selected from the nearest rain gauge station koyria station to the village of touré see fig 6 agricultural practices such as tillage digging or crust removal cause changes in the features of the terrain such as infiltration rate or water holding capacity ndiaye et al 2005 the most widely used method to take into account all these features is the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method soil conservation service 1985 mishra and singh 2003 the runoff produced by a rainfall event is calculated through the following equations r p i a 2 p i a s i f p i a r 0 i f p i a considering s 100 cn 1 s 0 i a 0 2 s where r is the runoff depth p is the total rainfall depth ia is the initial abstraction s is the potential maximum retention the unit of all variables is mm s0 254 mm is a conversion parameter and cn is the curve number that defines the permeability rate of the analyzed soil in this study the scs cn method was conventionally used not to convert the amount of rainfall in runoff instead it was inversely used to evaluate the value of cn correspondent to the runoff attenuation of each analyzed configuration then from the calculation of the r it is possible to define the runoff coefficient rc as the ratio between the runoff depth r and the rainfall amount p the value of rc will give the evaluation of the efficiency in terms of runoff mitigation among the different configurations 4 2 hydraulic model the rainfall runoff model was set up to calculate the hydrographs at the outlet of each configuration to achieve this purpose the hec ras v5 0 6 software hydrologic engineering center river analysis system brunner 2002 was used with the configuration rain on grid this set up allows using hyetographs as boundary conditions a direct uniform precipitation is applied on the 2d computational domain and when runoff is generated the hydraulic model computes the flow propagation solving the shallow water equations swe the solver allows choosing between two sets of equations based on the type of flow momentum equations full swe and diffusion wave equations dwe the former represents the complete form of the swe instead the dwe represents an approximation used in case of shallow frictional and gravity flow for all hydrodynamic analyses dwe have been used hec ras has been chosen for the capability to use very high resolution topographic data without leading to illogical long run time the code makes use of the sub grid bathymetry approach casulli 2009 casulli and stelling 2011 in which hydraulic radius volume and cross sectional area of each computational cell are pre computed and this allows to use a relatively coarse computational grid without compromise the fluid simulation this approach permitted to take advantage from the high resolution dsm and accurately simulate the smaller rwht since all results of these study are comparisons between different simulations a constant manning s coefficient was applied to all configurations 4 3 statistics in order to investigate the relation between geometrical features and hydraulic performance of the rwht analyzed a statistical dependence between these variables has been searched the pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to evaluate the linear correlation between variables correlation coefficient values range from 1 to 1 where 1 is the perfect positive or negative correlation and 0 is the absence of correlation the level of statistical significance α was also calculated to test the robustness of the correlation correlation is statistically significant if α 0 05 5 results 5 1 conceptual model rwht performance evaluation the hydraulic performance of the analyzed rwht were evaluated through comparisons between outcomes coming from the different configuration simulated the first hydraulic performance evaluated is the flow peak reduction fpr related to each configuration fpr was evaluated as the reduction of the maximum flow rate compared with the outcome of the plain configuration u ps hydrographs at the outlet are displayed in fig 7 showing the different response of each rwht to rainfall events moreover the maximum discharge with the related fpr per each output is reported in table 4 both hydrographs and fpr show how the configuration s hm staggered half moon has the best performance with a value of flow peak reduction higher than 70 relevant is the difference in the performance of the two smallest rwht a pp and s pp observing the trend of the hydrograph can be highlighted two marked phases before the filling and after the filling of the storage volume before the filling planting pits strongly slow the flow being homogeneously distributed on the ground despite this optimal behavior the small size of the dug basins cannot retain a large amount of water and when pits are filled the global friction decreases and the outgoing discharge quickly increases this phenomenon is equivalent to the principles of non uniform floodplain storage explained in the principles of river engineering jansen et al 1994 where the volume of the flow wave exceeds the storage volume for the heavy rainfall the a pp and s pp hydrographs show a chopped head wave up to the minute 46 then the flow reduction fails and the discharge increases instead for the extreme rainfall this behavior is much more marked leading to a slight fpr 20 23 indeed the storage capacity already run out at minute 28 this behavior can be observed also for the a vt and s vt both configurations fail in case of the extreme event showing an evident increase from the minute 39 to 49 on the contrary heavy rainfall does not use up all the retention capacity of the vallerani technique avoiding the abrupt change of slope in the outflow hydrographs the second performance evaluated is the volume reduction vr at the end of each simulation fig s4 displays the cumulated volume over the time of each simulation vr was evaluated as the reduction of the cumulated volume flowed out of the domain compared with the outcome of the plain configuration u ps the total volume flowed out of the domain during the simulation v and the vr per each configuration is summarized in table 5 subtracting v of the different configurations from u ps volume it is possible to evaluate the amount of retained volume in each rwht the retained volume is water that does not reach immediately the receptor water body slowing down the growth of the flood wave these results also confirm that s hm has the best performance and they are able to intercept the greater amount of runoff utilizing the concept behind the scs cn method knowing the cumulated volume from simulations it is possible goes back to the cn that characterizes the modified surface and discovers the relative runoff depth the net amount of precipitation that generated the cumulated volume table 6 since that scs cn method is based on a relation between p and r that follows power law for a small amount of precipitation a small variation of the cn produces a great change of r this means that for example an extreme event of 40 mm on a field with staggered half moons produce the same runoff of an event with an amount of rainfall of 12 mm on a non treated surface on the other hand the same amount of runoff can be observed on a surface with rwht for rainfall events with an intensity much higher than on a plain surface these results can be translated into the variation of runoff coefficient rc related to each adopted technique the rc values are summarized in table 7 focusing on the most efficient practice the application of staggered half moons on a completely crusted soil almost waterproof with a rc close to one could lead to a significative reduction of the runoff coefficient meaning that only one third of the total amount of rain will flow downstream the cultivated field to evaluate whether the efficiency of the analyzed configuration is uniquely related to the design of the technique itself a series of correlations have been searched the most characterizing feature of each rwht is the volume of the single micro catchment excavation volume ev for this reason the correlation between fpr and vr and this characteristic has been explored table 8 all coefficients show a significant correlation with both vr and fpr for extreme rainfall conversely correlations for heavy rainfall seem do not exist to deeply understand whether geometrical arrangement affects the analysis correlation coefficients have been calculated considering separately each configuration as reported in table 9 there is a strong positive correlation for both configurations in case of an extreme event observing the heavy rainfall staggered configuration shows a marked correlation with ev even if with a low level of significance due to the small size of the sample instead no correlation can be found for the aligned configuration the demonstration can be found in the different behavior of rwht for the two geometrical configurations indeed a hm and a ht show a much lower efficiency than the staggered equivalent 5 2 real watershed flood mitigation assessment staggered half moon s hm showed the best performance in terms of flow peak and volume reduction and so rc decrease thus s hm was chosen as rwht to be tested on the real topography hydraulic simulations were carried out on the original and modified topography fig 8 displays how the original surface has been modified with the addition of staggered half moons three scenarios have been analyzed the two parametrized rainfall events and the rainstorm occurred on 06 august 2012 the outflow has been calculated at the closure section of the basin and hydrographs have been compared hydrographs are reported in fig 9 and cumulated volumes in fig s4 the parametrized events produce a similar hydrograph with a marked flow peak reduction for the heavy rainfall despite only the 5 of the basin surface was treated with s hm all hydrographs show a significant fpr around 10 highlighting the benefit of the presence of rwht see table 10 the mitigation effect of the rwht leads to the generation of smaller flood wave along the basin in terms of vr the modified layout shows a decrease in performance as the intensity of the rainfall increases table 11 this negative trend is due to that most of the hm storage volume has been overfilled by the increasing overland flow during the event comparing the values of fpr and vr can be noticed that they have not the same trend see table 10 and table 11 observing the fpr s hm seems to be more efficient for the real rainfall even though the magnitude p 50 mm is higher than the extreme rainfall p 40 mm this is due to the shorter duration of the event which allows collecting the initial runoff more efficiently the rc values evaluated for the two configurations are reported in table 12 6 discussions application of rwht induces a series of positive impacts that lead to an improvement of dryland ecosystems functioning such as aquifer recharge and increase in soil moisture vohland and barry 2009 the main scope of rwht is to collect as much water as possible during the rainy season minimizing variability in water availability to prevent deficits during dry spells rockström et al 2002 this should prevent crop failures enhancing food security komariah and senge 2013 they are used not only for crop production but also as micro basin to plant trees coping with the issue of deforestation that affects sahelian regions this study analyzes another important aspect related to rwht how rwht can be used as a smart and sustainable solution to mitigate flood hazard results reported in the previous section show how the retention capacity of rwht may lead to a consistent reduction of the runoff both at the scale of the agricultural field conceptual model and at the basin scale from the different rwht and geometrical configurations examined it was found that in all cases the staggered configuration has superior performance than the aligned configuration for this reason independently of the adopted technique farmers should use a staggered arrangement as agricultural practice moreover s hm has the best performance among the different precipitations the good performance of planting pit and vallerani trenches for heavy rainfall indicate that these techniques should be preferably used in arid areas northern border of the sahelian strip where the amount of rainfall per event does not exceed their storage capacity in semi arid region characterized by more intense precipitation half moon or hand dug trenches are preferable rather than micro basins with very small size building a large number of mc rwht will increase the water holding capacity of the whole basin reducing the runoff and the potentially dangerous flood wave downstream moreover the decrease of runoff causes a reduction of sediment transport capacity of the overland flow preventing topsoil erosion with losses of precious nutrient surface runoff running on bare crusted soil has a high erosive potential also in flatland and often digs rills and gullies develop a vast drainage network the impoverishment of vegetative coverage during the great drought enhanced the propagation of gullies losing tones of fertile soil descroix et al 2012a b leblanc et al 2008 mamadou et al 2015 thus rwht accomplish also the task of anti erosion action against flash floods avoiding the accumulation of the overland flow in narrow channels rwht protect the agricultural surface by rill and gully erosion moreover storing rainwater they noticeably raise the survival capacity of the emerging vegetation reducing overland flow rwht provide a remarkable reduction of the runoff coefficient of treated areas results from hydraulic simulations report that changes of rc are related to the efficiency of the adopted rainwater harvesting technique this parameter will identify the hydrological response to rainstorms of the improved agricultural field the wider use of these techniques could stop the uninterrupted increase of runoff coefficient that is affecting sahelian watersheds since the 1960 s descroix et al 2018 this hydrological phenomenon was designated as sahelian paradox and many studies have tried to explain which the natural or anthropological drivers are first of all the long dry spell called the great drought 1968 1991 led to a heavy land use land cover modification characterized by vegetation dying with consequent formation of bare soil exposed to crusting and erosion amogu et al 2010 leblanc et al 2008 this drastically changed the surface hydrological features reducing the water holding capacity of the soil with a direct increase of the rc therefore the development of policies aimed to spread the use of rwht could be the solution to reverse the hazardous positive trend of rc since a positive correlation has been found between storage volume and hydraulic performance mainly for extreme events it is fundamental keeping constant the maintenance of each micro basin every year displacement of topsoil caused by sheet erosion induced by raindrops or sheet flow and consequent sedimentation might reduce the storage capacity during the monsoon season for this reason the rwht design should avoid excessive spacing between structures furthermore it is fundamental planning the type of maintenance based on the purpose for which rwht are used for example rwht for food production are often filled with organic manure or compost to enhance the nutrient supply rising the soil fertility aune et al 2017 critchley et al 1991 roose et al 1999 zougmoré et al 2003 but in doing so the storage capacity of the single structure drastically drops down reducing the efficiency in terms of runoff mitigation 7 conclusion considering the long series of catastrophic floods that have been affecting sub saharan countries more effort is requested to develop effective strategies aimed to improve flood hazard and risk management climate changes and environmental degradation have been identified as the drivers that are causing the exacerbating of flooding events therefore sustainable land management aimed at the use of climate smart agriculture practices would be a valid solution to face these problems the present study gives an assessment of the hydraulic performance of mc rwht evaluating the applicability of these techniques as a strategy for flood prevention and mitigation hydraulic simulations were set out to investigate the capability of these techniques to reduce the outgoing flow from a conceptual and from a real basin this study shows that the choice of the staggered arrangement gives always better performance than the aligned configuration staggered half moon resulted in the most efficient rwht in terms of flow peak and volume reduction a weakness of the hydraulic model used is that some components of the hydrological balance are neglected infiltration and evapotranspiration focusing only on the movement of the overland flux however this assumption is compatible with the temporal scale of simulations further works should use integrated hydrological models involving all parameter of the hydrological cycle in order to expand the temporal scale of the analyses despite these limitations the study shows how treating the land surface with rwht lead to a remarkable reduction of the runoff coefficient of the whole basin thus upscaling the use of these techniques will improve the landscape and hydrological functions of drylands authority could opt for a large reservoir to prevent floods and retain water but in this type of climate dominated by extremely high evaporation ratio would lead to the wastefulness of resource in these countries where most of the inhabitants are agro pastoralists farmers should invest in rwht facing simultaneously with food security and flood risk furthermore social factors play an important role in these communities where the concept of improving lands that are communally used is unfamiliar the success failure of the rwht strongly depends on the acceptance of the system by the local population which should be actively involved in the implementation and maintenance of such rainwater harvesting systems thus a participative collaboration between land users farmers and planners watershed authority would lead to an improvement of indigenous practices and dissemination on a wider scale the challenge for the future of these regions will be the development of watershed management strategies that involve rwht as a driver for environmental restoration and flood mitigation

5492,the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to tackle anthropic and climate changes impacts is becoming a priority in drought prone areas this study examines the capabilities of indigenous rainwater harvesting techniques rwht to be used as a viable solution for flood mitigation the study analyses the hydraulic performance of the most used micro catchment rwht in sub saharan regions in terms of flow peak reduction fpr and volume reduction vr at the field and basin scale parametrized hyetographs were built to replicate the extreme precipitations that strike sahelian countries during rainy seasons 2d hydrodynamic simulations showed that half moons placed with a staggered configuration s hm have the best performances in reducing runoff at the field scale s hm showed a remarkable fpr of 77 and a vr of 70 in case of extreme rainfall instead at the basin scale in which only 5 of the surface was treated 13 and 8 respectively for fpr and vr were obtained in addition the reduction of the runoff coefficient rc between the different configuration was analyzed the study critically evaluates hydraulic performances of the different techniques and shows how pitting practices cannot guarantee high performance in case of extreme precipitations these results will enrich the knowledge of the hydraulic behavior of rwht aspect marginally investigated in the scientific literature moreover this study presents the first scientific application of hec ras as a rainfall runoff model despite some limitations this model has the effective feature of using very high resolution topography as input for hydraulic simulations the results presented in this study should encourage stakeholders to upscale the use of rwht in order to lessen the flood hazard and land degradation that oppresses arid and semi arid areas keywords rainwater harvesting techniques extreme rainfall runoff hydraulic modelling flood mitigation arid and semi arid climate 1 introduction arid and semi arid asa regions worldwide are characterized by a climate with a low amount of rainfall concentrated during short rainy seasons in these areas the most used farming system is rainfed agriculture which is totally based on rainfall to grow crops to deal with the low amount of annual rainfall and extreme climatic uncertainty farmers have developed several agricultural techniques to harvest rainwater ammar et al 2016 during the past thirty years many authors have named these agricultural practices with different terms such as runoff water harvesting is the term used by salazar et al salazar and casanova 2011 rainwater harvesting practice vohland and barry 2009 or the novel term of climate smart agriculture csa technologies partey et al 2018 in this work the term rainwater harvesting techniques rwht adopted by biazin et al 2012 will be used rwht have been used in worldwide asa countries middle east china india americas and africa over the history but their use was put aside during the green revolution in which new technologies resulted more successful gould et al 2014 mekdaschi studer and liniger 2013 nowadays in the era characterized by climate changes cc the utilization of rainwater harvesting techniques is rediscovered as an adaptive behavior to cope with the increasing water scarcity and climate exacerbation mukheibir 2010 ray and simpson 2014 turton and ohlsson 1999 cc are considerably modifying the hydrology and the response of watersheds to extreme events focusing on sub saharan africa the hydrology of the sahelian strip has changed several times over the last 70 years different studies have found three distinct periods characterized by a specific hydrological behavior the first period can be extended from the installation of the first rain gauging stations middle of the last century to the end of the 1960 s in which rain fell abundantly with a constant pattern the second comprises the twenty year period 1970 1990 called the great drought characterized by a long deficit period the third period starts from the end of the 20th century and shows a slight increase in precipitation even if the annual total amount of precipitation almost reached the average of the entire recorded period rainfall events show a greater interannual variability that is leading to an exacerbation of rainstorms particularly the rainfall regime of the last twenty years is characterized by a smaller number of rainy days and a significant growth of the occurrence of extreme daily rainfall panthou et al 2014 this corresponds to an increase of hydrodynamic intensity in which the hydrological cycle is characterized by longer dry spells and higher precipitation intensity giorgi et al 2011 with the ongoing global warming this is one of the climate anomalies that is affecting african countries nowadays national centers for environmental information 2019 the higher frequency of extreme events tied with the incessant land cover changes are leading to severe floods aich et al 2015 2016 amogu et al 2015 descroix et al 2012a b mahé and paturel 2009 recent studied highlighted how the frequency of flooding events is greatly increased in the last twenty years and their occurrence will increase in following years tamagnone et al 2019 wilcox et al 2018 thus impelling is the necessity to develop policies and strategies concerning flood risk mitigation this study investigates hydraulic performances of rwht meaning the effectiveness in runoff reduction exploring their capability as non structural flood mitigation techniques the features of simplicity replicability efficiency adaptability and the low cost of implementation and maintenance make the use of rwht suitable in a wide range of contexts al seekh and mohammad 2009 moreover about 70 of the entire sub saharan population is employed in the agricultural sector and could potentially put their effort in spreading these techniques on a wider range of drylands rockström et al 2010 nowadays rwht are primarily used to increase soil water storage soil fertility and consequently crop yield walker et al 2005 many studies have analyzed the benefit in crop production provided by the adoption of these techniques hensley et al 2011 malley et al 2004 tabor 1995 zougmoré et al 2003 rwht have been used also to restore degraded land the functions of decreasing surface runoff reducing erosion of fertile topsoil and increasing infiltration are effective in contrasting the ongoing desertification in drought prone areas reij 2009 other studies have developed different techniques to identify suitable sites where the use of rwht could be successful adham et al 2016 ammar et al 2016 kahinda et al 2008 until now the concept of flood reduction coupled with rwht has been analyzed primarily in flood prone urban areas freni and liuzzo 2019 haider et al 2019 palla et al 2017 teston et al 2018 on the contrary few studies have investigated and evaluated the effect of rwht on runoff reduction in rural environments al seekh and mohammad 2009 and ali et al 2010 conducted tests on artificial runoff plots to directly measure the amount of runoff after rainstorms welderufael et al 2008 implemented a morin and cluff mc runoff model to investigate the rainfall runoff relationships on treated and non treated fields of dera ethiopia verbist et al 2009 combined on site measurements with the use of the software hydrus 2d to evaluate the effect of an infiltration trench on a hillside in chile the work presented here provides a quantitative assessment of the hydraulic performance of rwht through advanced hydraulic modelling expanding also the scale of the analysis from the farming field to a watershed scale different hydraulic simulations have been carried out to study firstly the performance of the most used micro catchment rainwater harvesting techniques mc rwht in terms of runoff reduction implementing a conceptual hydraulic model field scale secondly the flood mitigation assessment of a real watershed due to the addition of rwht basin scale the outcomes demonstrate how rwht are an efficient strategy to reduce runoff overflowing out of farm fields decreasing the amount of water that quickly is supplied to the receptor river during severe rainstorms several stakeholders could benefit from the original contribution of this study such as farmers countryside regional planners and governance to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies furthermore this is the first study in which a rainfall runoff model is implemented using the hydraulic software hec ras v 5 0 6 adopting precipitation as a boundary condition this software has been created as a hydraulic software and still presents some limitations in the transformation of precipitation in runoff despite these constraints the possibility to use measured hyetographs or forecast in an hydraulic freeware and considering future upgrades in which hydrological tools will be added open interesting opportunities for innovative hydrological hydraulic studies the structure of the paper has been organized into four parts the first part reports the materials such as data and topography and describes the methodologies used in this research the second part sets out results section three deals with discussions related to the outcomes in the last section conclusions and future perspectives are drawn 2 materials and methods in this paper a series of acronyms have been used and repeated therefore for clarity are summarized in table 1 the workflow followed in this work is schematized in fig 1 2 1 study area different rwht have been developed by indigenous farmers from asa regions all over the world in this study rwht mainly used in the african sahel have been analyzed the sahelian strip is located between the parallel 10 n and 17 n and includes from west to east big countries such as senegal mauritania mali burkina faso niger chad sudan fig 2 its climate is characterized by an annual pluviometry that range from about 100 mm at the north to 800 mm at the south ali and lebel 2009 it has an ecological dry season of 8 9 months and a rainfall pattern mainly concentrated in august the ongoing climate changes seem to provide more water availability in sahelian countries seidou 2018 but with a greater spatial and temporal variability that do not help populations to overcome water scarcity some studies showed that almost 50 of the annual rainfall amount falls in the occurrence of extremely short a few hours or less rainstorms with high intensity balme et al 2006 this type of climate provides vast opportunities for water harvesting 3 geometrical data 3 1 rwht technical specifications during the last thirty years different researchers have classified the rwht on the base of specific factors such as size location design etc water harvesting systems were classified by oweis et al oweis 1999 oweis et al 2001 and a detailed list of the most used was reported in the work of yazar and ali 2016 this study is focused on micro catchment rwht mic rwht commonly used in sub saharan countries biazin et al 2012 boers et al 1986 boers and ben asher 1982 mekdaschi studer and liniger 2013 they can be collected in four main categories related to the type of processing technique fig s1 the design of these systems varies depending on the place where the technique has been developed and consequently it is possible to find different technical features mekdaschi studer and liniger 2013 in this work the authors have analyzed 4 different techniques half moons planting pits hand dug trenches vallerani trenches following technical specifications reported in the global database on sustainable land management wocat 2019 which are displayed in table 2 4 topographic data the hydraulic analyses carried out in this work have used two different topographic data as input geometry firstly in order to schematize an agricultural field with and without rwht a conceptual hydraulic model was implemented using a series of artificial geometries these were built shaping the selected rwht on a plain square of 1 ha with a constant slope of 1 the four analyzed rwht have been modelled following two geometrical schemes a aligned framework and b staggered framework an unmodified plain square was kept as reference geometry to carry out comparisons between the different configurations all geometries have been manipulated using the processing tools of qgis qgis development team 2009 in this article the abbreviation listed in table 3 will be used to identify outcomes related to each simulated configuration geometrical scheme of the configurations is displayed in fig s2 and fig s3 see supplementary material secondly hydraulic simulations were carried out on a real watershed next to the village of touré niger the settlement is located along the left bank of the sirba river the main tributary of the middle niger river basin its inhabitants have been affected by floods several times during the last decades with important losses of houses cattle and goods fiorillo et al 2018 massazza et al 2019 the topography is represented by the digital surface model dsm of the riverine territory the dsm was elaborated during aerial surveys with a drone by belcore et al 2019 at the end of the wet season 2018 the dsm has a high level of resolution of 8 cm since the riverine territory is characterized by the presence of a series of gullies flowing into the river a hydrological analysis was carried out to delineate the watersheds that collect rainwater into each gully the elevation model of the widest basin 26 ha has been used to implement the hydraulic model on a real geometry successively the dsm of the basin was modified in order to simulate the presence of rwht on a farming area target agricultural fields highlighted in fig 3 about 5 of the whole watershed outcomes from the hydraulic model will be identified with the name original and modified respectively having as geometry input the unmodified dsm and the modified dsm 4 1 hydrological data hydraulic analyses carried out in this study focused on hydrometeorological extremes that are the causes of floods thus extreme and heavy rainfall have been chosen as inputs for hydraulic simulations following the results showed by panthou et al 2014 extreme rainfall for the analyzed study region corresponds to precipitation of 40 mm that occurs on average less than 2 5 times per year instead 20 mm was chosen as magnitude for heavy rainfalls with a yearly occurrence lesser of 10 times typically the evolution of these events can be associated to an organized convective system ocs in which the front of the convective cell brings the mayor part of the rain and it is followed by a stratiform trail mathon et al 2002 hyetographs produced by this convective system are organized in two well defined intervals a high intensity peak often with a duration lesser of an hour followed by a low intensity constant tail fig 4 the shape of ocs hyetograph lends itself well to being disaggregated and parameterized in order to obtain a reconstructed realistic hyetograph in order to obtain a realistic hyetograph for both extreme and heavy rainfall the 5 parameters model proposed by balme et al 2006 was chosen to create the inputs for the rainfall runoff model all parameters are related to the total event rainfall p and are calculated as follows where pc is the total precipitation of the convective part im is the maximum rainfall intensity ps is the total precipitation of the stratiform part dc is the duration convective of the convective part dt is the total duration of the rainfall event and is is the stratiform intensity the coefficients that were calibrated optimizing the efficiency of the parametrized hyetograph to simulate real precipitation events are a 0 89 b 0 08 c 2 1 d 0 53 and is 1 5 mm h the parametrized hyetographs for the two analyzed events are displayed in fig 5 in addition to simulate a real event on a real topography the hyetograph with the highest intensity of the wet season 2012 was selected from the nearest rain gauge station koyria station to the village of touré see fig 6 agricultural practices such as tillage digging or crust removal cause changes in the features of the terrain such as infiltration rate or water holding capacity ndiaye et al 2005 the most widely used method to take into account all these features is the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method soil conservation service 1985 mishra and singh 2003 the runoff produced by a rainfall event is calculated through the following equations r p i a 2 p i a s i f p i a r 0 i f p i a considering s 100 cn 1 s 0 i a 0 2 s where r is the runoff depth p is the total rainfall depth ia is the initial abstraction s is the potential maximum retention the unit of all variables is mm s0 254 mm is a conversion parameter and cn is the curve number that defines the permeability rate of the analyzed soil in this study the scs cn method was conventionally used not to convert the amount of rainfall in runoff instead it was inversely used to evaluate the value of cn correspondent to the runoff attenuation of each analyzed configuration then from the calculation of the r it is possible to define the runoff coefficient rc as the ratio between the runoff depth r and the rainfall amount p the value of rc will give the evaluation of the efficiency in terms of runoff mitigation among the different configurations 4 2 hydraulic model the rainfall runoff model was set up to calculate the hydrographs at the outlet of each configuration to achieve this purpose the hec ras v5 0 6 software hydrologic engineering center river analysis system brunner 2002 was used with the configuration rain on grid this set up allows using hyetographs as boundary conditions a direct uniform precipitation is applied on the 2d computational domain and when runoff is generated the hydraulic model computes the flow propagation solving the shallow water equations swe the solver allows choosing between two sets of equations based on the type of flow momentum equations full swe and diffusion wave equations dwe the former represents the complete form of the swe instead the dwe represents an approximation used in case of shallow frictional and gravity flow for all hydrodynamic analyses dwe have been used hec ras has been chosen for the capability to use very high resolution topographic data without leading to illogical long run time the code makes use of the sub grid bathymetry approach casulli 2009 casulli and stelling 2011 in which hydraulic radius volume and cross sectional area of each computational cell are pre computed and this allows to use a relatively coarse computational grid without compromise the fluid simulation this approach permitted to take advantage from the high resolution dsm and accurately simulate the smaller rwht since all results of these study are comparisons between different simulations a constant manning s coefficient was applied to all configurations 4 3 statistics in order to investigate the relation between geometrical features and hydraulic performance of the rwht analyzed a statistical dependence between these variables has been searched the pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to evaluate the linear correlation between variables correlation coefficient values range from 1 to 1 where 1 is the perfect positive or negative correlation and 0 is the absence of correlation the level of statistical significance α was also calculated to test the robustness of the correlation correlation is statistically significant if α 0 05 5 results 5 1 conceptual model rwht performance evaluation the hydraulic performance of the analyzed rwht were evaluated through comparisons between outcomes coming from the different configuration simulated the first hydraulic performance evaluated is the flow peak reduction fpr related to each configuration fpr was evaluated as the reduction of the maximum flow rate compared with the outcome of the plain configuration u ps hydrographs at the outlet are displayed in fig 7 showing the different response of each rwht to rainfall events moreover the maximum discharge with the related fpr per each output is reported in table 4 both hydrographs and fpr show how the configuration s hm staggered half moon has the best performance with a value of flow peak reduction higher than 70 relevant is the difference in the performance of the two smallest rwht a pp and s pp observing the trend of the hydrograph can be highlighted two marked phases before the filling and after the filling of the storage volume before the filling planting pits strongly slow the flow being homogeneously distributed on the ground despite this optimal behavior the small size of the dug basins cannot retain a large amount of water and when pits are filled the global friction decreases and the outgoing discharge quickly increases this phenomenon is equivalent to the principles of non uniform floodplain storage explained in the principles of river engineering jansen et al 1994 where the volume of the flow wave exceeds the storage volume for the heavy rainfall the a pp and s pp hydrographs show a chopped head wave up to the minute 46 then the flow reduction fails and the discharge increases instead for the extreme rainfall this behavior is much more marked leading to a slight fpr 20 23 indeed the storage capacity already run out at minute 28 this behavior can be observed also for the a vt and s vt both configurations fail in case of the extreme event showing an evident increase from the minute 39 to 49 on the contrary heavy rainfall does not use up all the retention capacity of the vallerani technique avoiding the abrupt change of slope in the outflow hydrographs the second performance evaluated is the volume reduction vr at the end of each simulation fig s4 displays the cumulated volume over the time of each simulation vr was evaluated as the reduction of the cumulated volume flowed out of the domain compared with the outcome of the plain configuration u ps the total volume flowed out of the domain during the simulation v and the vr per each configuration is summarized in table 5 subtracting v of the different configurations from u ps volume it is possible to evaluate the amount of retained volume in each rwht the retained volume is water that does not reach immediately the receptor water body slowing down the growth of the flood wave these results also confirm that s hm has the best performance and they are able to intercept the greater amount of runoff utilizing the concept behind the scs cn method knowing the cumulated volume from simulations it is possible goes back to the cn that characterizes the modified surface and discovers the relative runoff depth the net amount of precipitation that generated the cumulated volume table 6 since that scs cn method is based on a relation between p and r that follows power law for a small amount of precipitation a small variation of the cn produces a great change of r this means that for example an extreme event of 40 mm on a field with staggered half moons produce the same runoff of an event with an amount of rainfall of 12 mm on a non treated surface on the other hand the same amount of runoff can be observed on a surface with rwht for rainfall events with an intensity much higher than on a plain surface these results can be translated into the variation of runoff coefficient rc related to each adopted technique the rc values are summarized in table 7 focusing on the most efficient practice the application of staggered half moons on a completely crusted soil almost waterproof with a rc close to one could lead to a significative reduction of the runoff coefficient meaning that only one third of the total amount of rain will flow downstream the cultivated field to evaluate whether the efficiency of the analyzed configuration is uniquely related to the design of the technique itself a series of correlations have been searched the most characterizing feature of each rwht is the volume of the single micro catchment excavation volume ev for this reason the correlation between fpr and vr and this characteristic has been explored table 8 all coefficients show a significant correlation with both vr and fpr for extreme rainfall conversely correlations for heavy rainfall seem do not exist to deeply understand whether geometrical arrangement affects the analysis correlation coefficients have been calculated considering separately each configuration as reported in table 9 there is a strong positive correlation for both configurations in case of an extreme event observing the heavy rainfall staggered configuration shows a marked correlation with ev even if with a low level of significance due to the small size of the sample instead no correlation can be found for the aligned configuration the demonstration can be found in the different behavior of rwht for the two geometrical configurations indeed a hm and a ht show a much lower efficiency than the staggered equivalent 5 2 real watershed flood mitigation assessment staggered half moon s hm showed the best performance in terms of flow peak and volume reduction and so rc decrease thus s hm was chosen as rwht to be tested on the real topography hydraulic simulations were carried out on the original and modified topography fig 8 displays how the original surface has been modified with the addition of staggered half moons three scenarios have been analyzed the two parametrized rainfall events and the rainstorm occurred on 06 august 2012 the outflow has been calculated at the closure section of the basin and hydrographs have been compared hydrographs are reported in fig 9 and cumulated volumes in fig s4 the parametrized events produce a similar hydrograph with a marked flow peak reduction for the heavy rainfall despite only the 5 of the basin surface was treated with s hm all hydrographs show a significant fpr around 10 highlighting the benefit of the presence of rwht see table 10 the mitigation effect of the rwht leads to the generation of smaller flood wave along the basin in terms of vr the modified layout shows a decrease in performance as the intensity of the rainfall increases table 11 this negative trend is due to that most of the hm storage volume has been overfilled by the increasing overland flow during the event comparing the values of fpr and vr can be noticed that they have not the same trend see table 10 and table 11 observing the fpr s hm seems to be more efficient for the real rainfall even though the magnitude p 50 mm is higher than the extreme rainfall p 40 mm this is due to the shorter duration of the event which allows collecting the initial runoff more efficiently the rc values evaluated for the two configurations are reported in table 12 6 discussions application of rwht induces a series of positive impacts that lead to an improvement of dryland ecosystems functioning such as aquifer recharge and increase in soil moisture vohland and barry 2009 the main scope of rwht is to collect as much water as possible during the rainy season minimizing variability in water availability to prevent deficits during dry spells rockström et al 2002 this should prevent crop failures enhancing food security komariah and senge 2013 they are used not only for crop production but also as micro basin to plant trees coping with the issue of deforestation that affects sahelian regions this study analyzes another important aspect related to rwht how rwht can be used as a smart and sustainable solution to mitigate flood hazard results reported in the previous section show how the retention capacity of rwht may lead to a consistent reduction of the runoff both at the scale of the agricultural field conceptual model and at the basin scale from the different rwht and geometrical configurations examined it was found that in all cases the staggered configuration has superior performance than the aligned configuration for this reason independently of the adopted technique farmers should use a staggered arrangement as agricultural practice moreover s hm has the best performance among the different precipitations the good performance of planting pit and vallerani trenches for heavy rainfall indicate that these techniques should be preferably used in arid areas northern border of the sahelian strip where the amount of rainfall per event does not exceed their storage capacity in semi arid region characterized by more intense precipitation half moon or hand dug trenches are preferable rather than micro basins with very small size building a large number of mc rwht will increase the water holding capacity of the whole basin reducing the runoff and the potentially dangerous flood wave downstream moreover the decrease of runoff causes a reduction of sediment transport capacity of the overland flow preventing topsoil erosion with losses of precious nutrient surface runoff running on bare crusted soil has a high erosive potential also in flatland and often digs rills and gullies develop a vast drainage network the impoverishment of vegetative coverage during the great drought enhanced the propagation of gullies losing tones of fertile soil descroix et al 2012a b leblanc et al 2008 mamadou et al 2015 thus rwht accomplish also the task of anti erosion action against flash floods avoiding the accumulation of the overland flow in narrow channels rwht protect the agricultural surface by rill and gully erosion moreover storing rainwater they noticeably raise the survival capacity of the emerging vegetation reducing overland flow rwht provide a remarkable reduction of the runoff coefficient of treated areas results from hydraulic simulations report that changes of rc are related to the efficiency of the adopted rainwater harvesting technique this parameter will identify the hydrological response to rainstorms of the improved agricultural field the wider use of these techniques could stop the uninterrupted increase of runoff coefficient that is affecting sahelian watersheds since the 1960 s descroix et al 2018 this hydrological phenomenon was designated as sahelian paradox and many studies have tried to explain which the natural or anthropological drivers are first of all the long dry spell called the great drought 1968 1991 led to a heavy land use land cover modification characterized by vegetation dying with consequent formation of bare soil exposed to crusting and erosion amogu et al 2010 leblanc et al 2008 this drastically changed the surface hydrological features reducing the water holding capacity of the soil with a direct increase of the rc therefore the development of policies aimed to spread the use of rwht could be the solution to reverse the hazardous positive trend of rc since a positive correlation has been found between storage volume and hydraulic performance mainly for extreme events it is fundamental keeping constant the maintenance of each micro basin every year displacement of topsoil caused by sheet erosion induced by raindrops or sheet flow and consequent sedimentation might reduce the storage capacity during the monsoon season for this reason the rwht design should avoid excessive spacing between structures furthermore it is fundamental planning the type of maintenance based on the purpose for which rwht are used for example rwht for food production are often filled with organic manure or compost to enhance the nutrient supply rising the soil fertility aune et al 2017 critchley et al 1991 roose et al 1999 zougmoré et al 2003 but in doing so the storage capacity of the single structure drastically drops down reducing the efficiency in terms of runoff mitigation 7 conclusion considering the long series of catastrophic floods that have been affecting sub saharan countries more effort is requested to develop effective strategies aimed to improve flood hazard and risk management climate changes and environmental degradation have been identified as the drivers that are causing the exacerbating of flooding events therefore sustainable land management aimed at the use of climate smart agriculture practices would be a valid solution to face these problems the present study gives an assessment of the hydraulic performance of mc rwht evaluating the applicability of these techniques as a strategy for flood prevention and mitigation hydraulic simulations were set out to investigate the capability of these techniques to reduce the outgoing flow from a conceptual and from a real basin this study shows that the choice of the staggered arrangement gives always better performance than the aligned configuration staggered half moon resulted in the most efficient rwht in terms of flow peak and volume reduction a weakness of the hydraulic model used is that some components of the hydrological balance are neglected infiltration and evapotranspiration focusing only on the movement of the overland flux however this assumption is compatible with the temporal scale of simulations further works should use integrated hydrological models involving all parameter of the hydrological cycle in order to expand the temporal scale of the analyses despite these limitations the study shows how treating the land surface with rwht lead to a remarkable reduction of the runoff coefficient of the whole basin thus upscaling the use of these techniques will improve the landscape and hydrological functions of drylands authority could opt for a large reservoir to prevent floods and retain water but in this type of climate dominated by extremely high evaporation ratio would lead to the wastefulness of resource in these countries where most of the inhabitants are agro pastoralists farmers should invest in rwht facing simultaneously with food security and flood risk furthermore social factors play an important role in these communities where the concept of improving lands that are communally used is unfamiliar the success failure of the rwht strongly depends on the acceptance of the system by the local population which should be actively involved in the implementation and maintenance of such rainwater harvesting systems thus a participative collaboration between land users farmers and planners watershed authority would lead to an improvement of indigenous practices and dissemination on a wider scale the challenge for the future of these regions will be the development of watershed management strategies that involve rwht as a driver for environmental restoration and flood mitigation

5493,accurately quantifying the daily evapotranspiration of the region is one of the essential steps for studying the water cycle and regulating water resources nowadays the combination of hydrologic model and remote sensing technology is considered to be an advanced means to estimate evapotranspiration and hydrological processes on a regional scale however continuous daily evapotranspiration cannot be simulated based on remote sensing image products in this study we developed a new model swh metric model by combining the swh model with the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric model to simulate continuous daily actual evapotranspiration et with high spatiotemporal resolution the new model solved the problem of et discontinuity calculated by remote sensing images and hydrological models regarding the results the simulation of the swh metric model had a high consistency with the eddy covariance measurements with an average r2 of 0 70 and a root mean square error of 0 67 mm day 1 and was superior to the swh model finally the swh metric model was used to estimate continuous et in the loess plateau in northern shaanxi lpns china meanwhile considering the interaction between the climate and the rugged terrain of the lpns the anusplin procedure was used to spatially interpolate the input meteorological factors of the model and the temporal resolution of the simulated et was 1 day and the spatial resolution was 1 km the swh metric model can improve the simulation accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of et and contribute to study the response mechanism of climate change to ecosystem it can provide a useful reference for the fine quantification and management of agricultural water consumption keywords actual evapotranspiration swh model metric model remote sensing swh metric model anusplin 1 introduction evapotranspiration is an important process of the water cycle and energy balance in the ecosystem which determines the water and heat transfer in the soil plant atmosphere system and is closely related to ecosystem productivity yang et al 2013 during the entire water cycle approximately 67 of the precipitation on land will eventually return to the atmosphere by et and is as high as 90 in arid areas that cover one third of the land area stannard 1993 therefore accurate and timely quantification of regional actual evapotranspiration is of great significance for studying regional water circulation mechanism and guiding agricultural water management hydrological models and remote sensing techniques are advanced tools for estimating actual evapotranspiration and related hydrological processes on a regional scale bastiaanssen 2000 beven et al 1988 for decades remote sensing based models from empirical formula to mechanism model have been developed or improved to estimate et at different spatiotemporal scales bastiaanssen et al 1998b 1998a shuttleworth and wallace 1985 su 2002 among these models the s w model has been widely used due to its few parameters and satisfactory simulation performance shuttleworth and wallace 1985 stannard 1993 zhang et al 2008 ortega farias et al 2010 however the estimation of canopy stomatal resistance hinders the application of the s w model hu et al 2009 developed the swh model by combining the s w model ball berry model and a light use efficiency based gross primary productivity gpp model the swh model needs a few input driving variables and realizes the simulation of stomatal conductance and gpp based on remote sensing products which solves the key problem of s w model in applications and is suitable for simulating the actual evapotranspiration at the regional scale hu et al 2013 however the temporal resolution of remote sensing image products i e lai fpar mod15a2 and ndvi evi mod13q1 is generally every 8 or 16 days in previous studies researchers set the model time step as 8 day or 16 day and input the average of the meteorological factors corresponding to the time step hu et al 2013 hu et al 2017 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the resultant et simulated by swh is the average value of multi day rather than daily actual evapotranspiration allen et al 2007 developed the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric the time interpolation module of this model is based on the reference et fraction etrf extrapolating et from the satellite image time to periods of 24 h or longer the etrf is defined as the ratio of instantaneous et to the alfalfa reference etr and the etr calculated by the weather station data better combine the local regional surface environment level allen et al 2007 the metric model not only better combines regional environmental conditions but also does not require knowledge of the developmental stage of the crop or the particular crop type metric model transforms high spatial resolution et simulated by hydrological models and remote sensing images into high spatiotemporal resolution which plays an important role in the precise study of agriculture and water resources in the previous research the metric model has been mostly used to estimate the daily et based on the sebal model or the energy balance equation and there have been some shortcomings such as complicated calculation process and a spatial ambiguity issue allen et al 2007 gowda et al 2008 allen et al 2011 allen et al 2013 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 baeumler et al 2019 as the most concentrated and largest loess area in the world the loess plateau in china faced water shortage and soil erosion this paper took the loess plateau in northern shaanxi lpns the center of the loess plateau in china as the research area to simulate the continuous daily et in this study we tried to develop the swh metric model combining the swh model with the time interpolation module of the metric model and used the eddy covariance data to evaluate the simulation performance of the new model the swh model based on remote sensing image accurately estimated the et over a large area on a pixel by pixel basis and the metric model improved the temporal resolution of et 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lpns is located in the central part of the loess plateau in china and the northern part of shaanxi province fig 1 and it is within the transition zone between the eastern monsoon humid region and the inland arid region li et al 2017a the lpns belongs to china s typical ecologically vulnerable area and sensitive climate change zone with a total land area of 92522 5 km2 and the elevation of 456 1882 m fig 2 a 2 2 data the meteorological datasets were acquired from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn the datasets

stations in surrounding areas from 2002 to 2009 geographic information such as the latitude and longitude of 54 sites were also obtained since there was no flux observation station in the lpns eddy covariance ec measurements collected at changwu agro ecological experiment station from 2005 to 2009 were obtained the data of which were from chinaflux eddy covariance tower stations the first 2005 and last 2009 year s data of ec measurements were used for model validation and the others were used for the calibration the longitude and latitude of changwu agro ecological experimental station hereinafter referred as changwu station are 107 68 e and 35 24 n respectively and the elevation is 1220 m the regional annual precipitation is 584 mm and the precipitation from may to september accounts for 80 of the whole year the annual average temperature is 9 1 tang et al 2012 this region belongs to the farmland ecosystem and the vegetation under the flux observation tower is winter wheat the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis has been widely used to provide the model with the required surface feature parameters friedl et al 2010 hu et al 2015 mu et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017b in this study the mod15a2 dataset from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn and mcd12q1 dataset from nasa http ladsweb nascom nasa gov were used during 2002 2009 mod15a2 including the leaf area index lai and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fpar is an 8 day composite dataset with a 1 km spatial resolution in other words we obtained

2002 in this paper we assumed that this was the data measured at the satellite overpass time and used the yearly 500 m mcd12q1 land cover data based on the international geosphere biosphere igbp to identify the vegetation types of lpns table 1 showed 17 types of igbp and their corresponding threshold parameters referring to zhou et al 2006 which were required in swh model the mod12q1 products were georeferenced and resampled to 1 km spatial resolution in this study the elevation map with spatial resolution of 1 km provided by cold and arid regions sciences data center at lanzhou http westdc westgis ac cn was also obtained and the above products were clipped to obtain the data in the lpns fig 2a and b are the elevation map of lpns and the vegetation type distribution in 2002 respectively 2 3 methods 2 3 1 anusplin procedure to be consistent with the spatial resolution of the mod15a2 dataset the meteorological factors at the site need to be spatially interpolated in areas with significant topographical features the main topographic features affecting the spatial pattern of climate are topography and water bodies daly 2006 the landform belongs to typical tableland gully region in the lpns fig 2 and li et al 2017a analyzed the contribution rate and sensitivity of meteorological factors to the et0 in the lpns and the result showed that in terms of sensitivity of et0 the rh was the highest followed by tmax and tmax was the highest in terms of contribution rate of et0 mcvicar et al 2007 concluded that topography strongly impacted the regional climate in coarse sandy hilly catchments including the eastern part of the lpns therefore the anusplin program hutchinson 1995 considering the interaction between climate and rugged terrain in the study area was selected to perform spatial interpolation for meteorological factor parameters of the lpns previous research has shown that results from anusplin had an advantage over other interpolation algorithms hijmans et al 2005 new et al 2002 price et al 2000 to make sure we are interpolating between stations for the entire lpns and not extrapolating at its edges the meteorological data of 29 stations around the lpns were also obtained 2 3 2 swh model the swh dual source evapotranspiration model was developed based on the s w model and explicitly specifying the energy exchanges at the soil and canopy the et formulas are as follows and details of model are available in shuttleworth and wallace 1985 1 λ e t c s p m s c c p m c 2 p m s δ r n g ρ c p v p d δ r as r n r n s r aa r as δ γ 1 r ss

the non growth phase g 0 was assigned a value of 0 hu et al 2009 the monte carlo algorithm binder and heermann 1988 was used to estimate the four empirical parameters b1 b2 b3 and a1 first according to the research results of the predecessors the range of values of these four factors was determined hu et al 2017 and a continuous and evenly distributed random number was generated in the above given range to form 5 million parameter sets second the dataset of each simulation was brought into the swh model and the calculated results were linearly analyzed by the eddy covariance data at the changwu station during 2006 2008 the coefficient of determination r2 and slope k for each dataset were obtained finally we selected the 20 highest r2 values under the condition that the k was in the range of 0 95 1 05 and the ranges of the distribution of the corresponding 20 parameter sets were identified as the feasible ranges based on these 20 parameters sets the swh model was used to simulate et of each pixel in the lpns 20 corresponding et simulations were obtained after this step and the average of the 20 simulations was considered as final et 2 3 3 metric model in this study e t swh mm day 1 on the day of the satellite image was calculated by the swh model for each pixel since the time resolution of modis dataset we chose is 8 days we obtained the e t swh based on remote sensing

sunshine duration and fpar fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation first we used the anusplin program for meteorological data to obtain the same spatial resolution as remote sensing images i e lai and fpar second we used swh model to estimate et based on remote sensing images and the result time step was set as 8 day as the satellite products were calculated as 8 day composites in order to yield the daily et the metric model based on the index e t r f was used to interpolate the simulation 3 results 3 1 swh metric model validation the parameterized swh model was combined with the metric model to develop the swh metric model the eddy covariance measurements of the changwu agro ecological experimental station in 2005 and 2009 were used for the swh metric model validation fig 4 in general the model successfully simulated et at the changwu station with the r2 between measured and modeled et about 0 7 which was better than the result simulated with optimal parameters in swh model from 2006 to 2008 r2 0 51 therefore combining the swh and metric model could improve the simulation performance however according to the slope and root mean square error rmse this model would underestimate daily et which was more obvious for larger daily et 3 2 performance of swh metric model at daily et simulation the results of simulated daily et with the swh metric model were shown in fig 5 a and b the swh metric model could simulate the fluctuation of continuous daily et especially in may to august when the continuous fluctuation was quite obvious in general the trend of et within the year simulated by the swh metric model was consistent with the ec flux data which both illustrated similar characteristics of bimodal distribution the crop planted in the changwu agro ecological experimental station is mainly winter wheat gan and liu 2006 of which the growth period is from october to june of the following year the figure showed that et began to increase since february peaked in may when the winter wheat grew well and then decreased due to the weaker physiological activity and weaker transpiration in july although the station was usually covered by bare soil the increase in precipitation led to the increase of soil water content and then promoted soil evaporation causing the second peak of et the observed data in this station showed that the total precipitation in july was 87 5 mm in 2005 and 128 mm in 2009 greater than the value in june 41 5 mm in 2005 and 17 4 mm in 2009 this conclusion was consistent with yuan et al 2017 meanwhile fig 5 also showed that the swh metric model would underestimate daily et as mentioned above the swh metric interpolated the results simulated by swh model to obtain daily et during each eight day period and in this case the daily et of every 8 days would not change in other words the higher et of every eight days simulated by swh model would result in higher daily et interpolated by swh metric model and vice versa the comparison between simulations of swh and ec measurements was shown in fig 5c and d where the underestimation of et already existed the possible reasons for this underestimation of daily et in the swh model would be stated in the discussion section we assumed that the two simulation values remained unchanged when drawing fig 5c and d during each eight day period 3 3 spatiotemporal variation of et the swh metric model was used to quantify the actual evapotranspiration in the lpns during 2002 2009 fig 6 showed that in general obvious regional difference existed in annual et in the lpns to be specific annual et values were higher in central regions than northern and southern regions except for luochuan county this distribution was consistent with the different elevations of the lpns actual evapotranspiration represents the complex interaction among climate vegetation soil and hydrological processes zhang et al 2001 here we simply stated the distribution characteristics of meteorological factors daily et and vegetation type without exploring their interactions according to fig 2a the elevation was relatively lower in luochuan county southern lpns and in the eastern regions in lpns especially for the eastern boundary region fig 2b indicated that central and northern lpns was mainly covered by grasslands while southern lpns except for luochuan county was mainly deciduous broadleaf forest analyses of meteorological factors showed that the relative humidity was higher in the southern lpns than northern lpns while the sunshine duration was just the opposite there was a negative correlation between temperature and elevation that is the higher the elevation the lower the temperature the faster wind speed was mainly located in the high altitude regions in terms of the temporal evolution of annual et its range was mainly between 150 and 500 mm year 1 in the lpns from 2002 to 2009 and the average et during this period was about 300 mm year 1 fig 6 showed that the et in the central lpns except for dingbian from 2002 to 2005 was greater than that from 2006 to 2009 after analyzing the interannual distribution of meteorological factors obvious difference only existed in the wind speed to be specific the wind speed in the central lpns except for dingbian from 2002 to 2005 was much smaller than that from 2006 to 2009 in this study time space sequence analysis at the grid scale was used to measure the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of et the slope in each grid was calculated by the least squares linear model linear fitted model to represent the trend of et and results showed that et in most regions in the lpns decreased during the study period significant decreasing trend p 0 05 was detected in 14 counties in the southern lpns including wuqi county zhidan county ansai county zichang county qingjian county yanchuan county yanchang county ganquan county yichuan county fu county and yan an city of which the area accounted for 32 of the total lpns no significant trends were found in other regions in the lpns 4 discussion the swh model proposed by hu et al 2013 has satisfactory performance to simulate et on forest and grassland ecosystems however the temporal resolution of simulated et depends on the temporal resolution of remote sensing images which are generally 8 days or 16 days previous studies have converted the meteorological data into the average value of 8 days or 16 days to match the swh model and therefore the simulated et was also the average value of 8 days or 16 days however continuous and accurate et is of great significance for agricultural production and regional water resources management thus in this study we coupled the swh model and metric model into the swh metric model and successfully simulated the daily et with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 1 day the daily et simulated by the swh metric model agreed well with the estimates obtained from the ec measurements with an average r2 of 0 70 and rmse of 0 67 mm day 1 in this study the software package anusplin was used for spatial interpolation and metric was used for temporal interpolation which were the basis and advantage of the swh metric model to realize accurate et simulation with high spatiotemporal resolution to better demonstrate the advantages of the metric model in temporal interpolation daily et was interpolated by metric on the ec measurements which was arranged by every eight days between 2005 and 2009 at changwu station four sets of daily et with good interpolation performance using the metric model were shown in fig 7 as table 2 suggests good interpolation performance was also obtained with the multi year average slope k 0 9 and r2 0 74 in terms of seasonal simulation the performance was generally worse than that of annual simulation to be specific the performance was better in spring march to may and autumn september to november than summer june to october and winter december to february to explore the reason for this we analyzed the meteorological data at changwu station on the one hand the precipitation here is scarce and not evenly distributed between years and within years the precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer with short duration but large precipitation which results in the lag effect on the actual evapotranspiration this lag effect could be detected by the instrument of eddy covariance system but cannot be represented by the etr in the metric model this error was particularly evident in the summer of 2006 on the other hand the ec measurements would be affected by weather like precipitation and fog resulting in outliers or missing values foken and wichura 1996 and data quality would be degraded with artificial interpolation hu et al 2017 in general the error in daily et interpolated from the sequence of every eight days was acceptable we have compared the et of every eight days simulated by the swh model daily et simulated by the swh metric model and the ec measurements based on all indicators in table 3 after coupling the metric model the swh metric model didn t result in larger cumulative error and actually improved the simulation performance therefore in terms of the temporal resolution and accuracy of simulated et we believed that the swh metric model had better performance at the changwu station than swh model meanwhile we have also compared the spatial distribution of seasonal et in spring and summer in 2004 and 2007 in the lpns fig 8 the vegetation type in the lpns was mainly grasslands with parts of southern region covered by forest thus we chose the spring and summer to include the growing seasons from april to september fig 8 showed that evident differences existed in the spring of 2004 and the summer of 2007 based on the above analyses we prefer swh metric model to simulate regional et it is worth noting that the swh model only considered the water vapor flux from soil water evaporation and vegetation transpiration but neglected the water vapor flux from the canopy hu et al 2013 actually the canopy interception may still account for a considerable fraction of the total et especially in rainy days which could explain the underestimation in the swh metric model previous studies have also confirmed this issue hu et al 2009 2013 2017 wu et al 2016 5 conclusions the swh metric model developed in this study had good performance for the calculation of continuous daily actual et based on remote sensing image products and meteorological variables and it can produce satisfactory estimation of continuous et at the high spatiotemporal resolution with the temporal resolution of 1 day and the spatial resolution of 1 km therefore the swh metric model will be helpful to study the water use of vegetation at different growth stages and the water circulation in large scale areas and provide a basis for agricultural water use evaluation and management it is worth noting that some parameters in the swh metric model needs to be adjusted one method is to conduct parameter modulation based on the eddy flux data as this paper the other is based on remote sensing et products however the remote sensing et product itself may have inevitable errors and the performance of the final simulation may be poor therefore measured data are indispensable in this model parameters optimization based on the measurements is the basis of good agreement between the model and the measured data however optimal parameters for different ecosystems are not consistent which may lead to errors when the model is used for different ecosystems but simulated with fixed parameters how to alleviate the errors caused by the

5493,accurately quantifying the daily evapotranspiration of the region is one of the essential steps for studying the water cycle and regulating water resources nowadays the combination of hydrologic model and remote sensing technology is considered to be an advanced means to estimate evapotranspiration and hydrological processes on a regional scale however continuous daily evapotranspiration cannot be simulated based on remote sensing image products in this study we developed a new model swh metric model by combining the swh model with the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric model to simulate continuous daily actual evapotranspiration et with high spatiotemporal resolution the new model solved the problem of et discontinuity calculated by remote sensing images and hydrological models regarding the results the simulation of the swh metric model had a high consistency with the eddy covariance measurements with an average r2 of 0 70 and a root mean square error of 0 67 mm day 1 and was superior to the swh model finally the swh metric model was used to estimate continuous et in the loess plateau in northern shaanxi lpns china meanwhile considering the interaction between the climate and the rugged terrain of the lpns the anusplin procedure was used to spatially interpolate the input meteorological factors of the model and the temporal resolution of the simulated et was 1 day and the spatial resolution was 1 km the swh metric model can improve the simulation accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of et and contribute to study the response mechanism of climate change to ecosystem it can provide a useful reference for the fine quantification and management of agricultural water consumption keywords actual evapotranspiration swh model metric model remote sensing swh metric model anusplin 1 introduction evapotranspiration is an important process of the water cycle and energy balance in the ecosystem which determines the water and heat transfer in the soil plant atmosphere system and is closely related to ecosystem productivity yang et al 2013 during the entire water cycle approximately 67 of the precipitation on land will eventually return to the atmosphere by et and is as high as 90 in arid areas that cover one third of the land area stannard 1993 therefore accurate and timely quantification of regional actual evapotranspiration is of great significance for studying regional water circulation mechanism and guiding agricultural water management hydrological models and remote sensing techniques are advanced tools for estimating actual evapotranspiration and related hydrological processes on a regional scale bastiaanssen 2000 beven et al 1988 for decades remote sensing based models from empirical formula to mechanism model have been developed or improved to estimate et at different spatiotemporal scales bastiaanssen et al 1998b 1998a shuttleworth and wallace 1985 su 2002 among these models the s w model has been widely used due to its few parameters and satisfactory simulation performance shuttleworth and wallace 1985 stannard 1993 zhang et al 2008 ortega farias et al 2010 however the estimation of canopy stomatal resistance hinders the application of the s w model hu et al 2009 developed the swh model by combining the s w model ball berry model and a light use efficiency based gross primary productivity gpp model the swh model needs a few input driving variables and realizes the simulation of stomatal conductance and gpp based on remote sensing products which solves the key problem of s w model in applications and is suitable for simulating the actual evapotranspiration at the regional scale hu et al 2013 however the temporal resolution of remote sensing image products i e lai fpar mod15a2 and ndvi evi mod13q1 is generally every 8 or 16 days in previous studies researchers set the model time step as 8 day or 16 day and input the average of the meteorological factors corresponding to the time step hu et al 2013 hu et al 2017 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the resultant et simulated by swh is the average value of multi day rather than daily actual evapotranspiration allen et al 2007 developed the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric the time interpolation module of this model is based on the reference et fraction etrf extrapolating et from the satellite image time to periods of 24 h or longer the etrf is defined as the ratio of instantaneous et to the alfalfa reference etr and the etr calculated by the weather station data better combine the local regional surface environment level allen et al 2007 the metric model not only better combines regional environmental conditions but also does not require knowledge of the developmental stage of the crop or the particular crop type metric model transforms high spatial resolution et simulated by hydrological models and remote sensing images into high spatiotemporal resolution which plays an important role in the precise study of agriculture and water resources in the previous research the metric model has been mostly used to estimate the daily et based on the sebal model or the energy balance equation and there have been some shortcomings such as complicated calculation process and a spatial ambiguity issue allen et al 2007 gowda et al 2008 allen et al 2011 allen et al 2013 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 baeumler et al 2019 as the most concentrated and largest loess area in the world the loess plateau in china faced water shortage and soil erosion this paper took the loess plateau in northern shaanxi lpns the center of the loess plateau in china as the research area to simulate the continuous daily et in this study we tried to develop the swh metric model combining the swh model with the time interpolation module of the metric model and used the eddy covariance data to evaluate the simulation performance of the new model the swh model based on remote sensing image accurately estimated the et over a large area on a pixel by pixel basis and the metric model improved the temporal resolution of et 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lpns is located in the central part of the loess plateau in china and the northern part of shaanxi province fig 1 and it is within the transition zone between the eastern monsoon humid region and the inland arid region li et al 2017a the lpns belongs to china s typical ecologically vulnerable area and sensitive climate change zone with a total land area of 92522 5 km2 and the elevation of 456 1882 m fig 2 a 2 2 data the meteorological datasets were acquired from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn the datasets

stations in surrounding areas from 2002 to 2009 geographic information such as the latitude and longitude of 54 sites were also obtained since there was no flux observation station in the lpns eddy covariance ec measurements collected at changwu agro ecological experiment station from 2005 to 2009 were obtained the data of which were from chinaflux eddy covariance tower stations the first 2005 and last 2009 year s data of ec measurements were used for model validation and the others were used for the calibration the longitude and latitude of changwu agro ecological experimental station hereinafter referred as changwu station are 107 68 e and 35 24 n respectively and the elevation is 1220 m the regional annual precipitation is 584 mm and the precipitation from may to september accounts for 80 of the whole year the annual average temperature is 9 1 tang et al 2012 this region belongs to the farmland ecosystem and the vegetation under the flux observation tower is winter wheat the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis has been widely used to provide the model with the required surface feature parameters friedl et al 2010 hu et al 2015 mu et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017b in this study the mod15a2 dataset from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn and mcd12q1 dataset from nasa http ladsweb nascom nasa gov were used during 2002 2009 mod15a2 including the leaf area index lai and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fpar is an 8 day composite dataset with a 1 km spatial resolution in other words we obtained

2002 in this paper we assumed that this was the data measured at the satellite overpass time and used the yearly 500 m mcd12q1 land cover data based on the international geosphere biosphere igbp to identify the vegetation types of lpns table 1 showed 17 types of igbp and their corresponding threshold parameters referring to zhou et al 2006 which were required in swh model the mod12q1 products were georeferenced and resampled to 1 km spatial resolution in this study the elevation map with spatial resolution of 1 km provided by cold and arid regions sciences data center at lanzhou http westdc westgis ac cn was also obtained and the above products were clipped to obtain the data in the lpns fig 2a and b are the elevation map of lpns and the vegetation type distribution in 2002 respectively 2 3 methods 2 3 1 anusplin procedure to be consistent with the spatial resolution of the mod15a2 dataset the meteorological factors at the site need to be spatially interpolated in areas with significant topographical features the main topographic features affecting the spatial pattern of climate are topography and water bodies daly 2006 the landform belongs to typical tableland gully region in the lpns fig 2 and li et al 2017a analyzed the contribution rate and sensitivity of meteorological factors to the et0 in the lpns and the result showed that in terms of sensitivity of et0 the rh was the highest followed by tmax and tmax was the highest in terms of contribution rate of et0 mcvicar et al 2007 concluded that topography strongly impacted the regional climate in coarse sandy hilly catchments including the eastern part of the lpns therefore the anusplin program hutchinson 1995 considering the interaction between climate and rugged terrain in the study area was selected to perform spatial interpolation for meteorological factor parameters of the lpns previous research has shown that results from anusplin had an advantage over other interpolation algorithms hijmans et al 2005 new et al 2002 price et al 2000 to make sure we are interpolating between stations for the entire lpns and not extrapolating at its edges the meteorological data of 29 stations around the lpns were also obtained 2 3 2 swh model the swh dual source evapotranspiration model was developed based on the s w model and explicitly specifying the energy exchanges at the soil and

to the research results of the predecessors the range of values of these four factors was determined hu et al 2017 and a continuous and evenly distributed random number was generated in the above given range to form 5 million parameter sets second the dataset of each simulation was brought into the swh model and the calculated results were linearly analyzed by the eddy covariance data at the changwu station during 2006 2008 the coefficient of determination r2 and slope k for each dataset were obtained finally we selected the 20 highest r2 values under the condition that the k was in the range of 0 95 1 05 and the ranges of the distribution of the corresponding 20 parameter sets were identified as the feasible ranges based on these 20 parameters sets the swh model was used to simulate et of each pixel in the lpns 20 corresponding et simulations were obtained after this step and the average of the 20 simulations was considered as final et 2 3 3 metric model in this study e t swh mm day 1 on the day of the satellite image was calculated by the swh model for each pixel since the time resolution of modis dataset we chose is 8 days we obtained the e t swh based on remote sensing images every eight days 7 e t r f e t swh e t r the two widely recognized reference et surfaces are a short crop similar to clipped grass e t 0 and a tall crop similar to full cover alfalfa e t r e t

using a cubic spline interpolation function for day i and e t period is cumulative et for the period for the day m to the day n in this paper we developed a new swh metric model by combining swh model

sunshine duration and fpar fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation first we used the anusplin program for meteorological data to obtain the same spatial resolution as remote sensing

in order to yield the daily et the metric model based on the index e t r f was used to interpolate the simulation 3 results 3 1 swh metric model validation the parameterized swh model was combined with the metric model to develop the swh metric model the eddy covariance measurements of the changwu agro ecological experimental station in 2005 and 2009 were used for the swh metric model validation fig 4 in general the model successfully simulated et at the changwu station with the r2 between measured and modeled et about 0 7 which was better than the result simulated with optimal parameters in swh model from 2006 to 2008 r2 0 51 therefore combining the swh and metric model could improve the simulation performance however according to the slope and root mean square error rmse this model would underestimate daily et which was more obvious for larger daily et 3 2 performance of swh metric model at daily et simulation the results of simulated daily et with the swh metric model were shown in fig 5 a and b the swh metric model could simulate the fluctuation of continuous daily et especially in may to august when the continuous fluctuation was quite obvious in general the trend of et within the year simulated by the swh metric model was consistent with the ec flux data which both illustrated similar characteristics of bimodal distribution the crop planted in the changwu agro ecological experimental station is mainly winter wheat gan and liu 2006 of which the growth period is from october to june of the following year the figure showed that et began to increase since february peaked in may when the winter wheat grew well and then decreased due to the weaker physiological activity and weaker transpiration in july although the station was usually covered by bare soil the increase in precipitation led to the increase of soil water content and then promoted soil evaporation causing the second peak of et the observed data in this station showed that the total precipitation in july was 87 5 mm in 2005 and 128 mm in 2009 greater than the value in june 41 5 mm in 2005 and 17 4 mm in 2009 this conclusion was consistent with yuan et al 2017 meanwhile fig 5 also showed that the swh metric model would underestimate daily et as mentioned above the swh metric interpolated the results simulated by swh model to obtain daily et during each eight day period and in this case the daily et of every 8 days would not change in other words the higher et of every eight days simulated by swh model would result in higher daily et interpolated by swh metric model and vice versa the comparison between simulations of swh and ec measurements was shown in fig 5c and d where the underestimation of et already existed the possible reasons for this underestimation of daily et in the swh model would be stated in the discussion section we assumed that the two simulation values remained unchanged when drawing fig 5c and d during each eight day period 3 3 spatiotemporal variation of et the swh metric model was used to quantify the actual evapotranspiration in the lpns during 2002 2009 fig 6 showed that in general obvious regional difference existed in annual et in the lpns to be specific annual et values were higher in central regions than northern and southern regions except for luochuan county this distribution was consistent with the different elevations of the lpns actual evapotranspiration represents the complex interaction among climate vegetation soil and hydrological processes zhang et al 2001 here we simply stated the distribution characteristics of meteorological factors daily et and vegetation type without exploring their interactions according to fig 2a the elevation was relatively lower in luochuan county southern lpns and in the eastern regions in lpns especially for the eastern boundary region fig 2b indicated that central and northern lpns was mainly covered by grasslands while southern lpns except for luochuan county was mainly deciduous broadleaf forest analyses of meteorological factors showed that the relative humidity was higher in the southern lpns than northern lpns while the sunshine duration was just the opposite there was a negative correlation between temperature and elevation that is the higher the elevation the lower the temperature the faster wind speed was mainly located in the high altitude regions in terms of the temporal evolution of annual et its range was mainly between 150 and 500 mm year 1 in the lpns from 2002 to 2009 and the average et during this period was about 300 mm year 1 fig 6 showed that the et in the central lpns except for dingbian from 2002 to 2005 was greater than that from 2006 to 2009 after analyzing the interannual distribution of meteorological factors obvious difference only existed in the wind speed to be specific the wind speed in the central lpns except for dingbian from 2002 to 2005 was much smaller than that from 2006 to 2009 in this study time space sequence analysis at the grid scale was used to measure the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of et the slope in each grid was calculated by the least squares linear model linear fitted model to represent the trend of et and results showed that et in most regions in the lpns decreased during the study period significant decreasing trend p 0 05 was detected in 14 counties in the southern lpns including wuqi county zhidan county ansai county zichang county qingjian county yanchuan county yanchang county ganquan county yichuan county fu county and yan an city of which the area accounted for 32 of the total lpns no significant trends were found in other regions in the lpns 4 discussion the swh model proposed by hu et al 2013 has satisfactory performance to simulate et on forest and grassland ecosystems however the temporal resolution of simulated et depends on the temporal resolution of remote sensing images which are generally 8 days or 16 days previous studies have converted the meteorological data into the average value of 8 days or 16 days to match the swh model and therefore the simulated et was also the average value of 8 days or 16 days however continuous and accurate et is of great significance for agricultural production and regional water resources management thus in this study we coupled the swh model and metric model into the swh metric model and successfully simulated the daily et with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 1 day the daily et simulated by the swh metric model agreed well with the estimates obtained from the ec measurements with an average r2 of 0 70 and rmse of 0 67 mm day 1 in this study the software package anusplin was used for spatial interpolation and metric was used for temporal interpolation which were the basis and advantage of the swh metric model to realize accurate et simulation with high spatiotemporal resolution to better demonstrate the advantages of the metric model in temporal interpolation daily et was interpolated by metric on the ec measurements which was arranged by every eight days between 2005 and 2009 at changwu station four sets of daily et with good interpolation performance using the metric model were shown in fig 7 as table 2 suggests good interpolation performance was also obtained with the multi year average slope k 0 9 and r2 0 74 in terms of seasonal simulation the performance was generally worse than that of annual simulation to be specific the performance was better in spring march to may and autumn september to november than summer june to october and winter december to february to explore the reason for this we analyzed the meteorological data at changwu station on the one hand the precipitation here is scarce and not evenly distributed between years and within years the precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer with short duration but large precipitation which results in the lag effect on the actual evapotranspiration this lag effect could be detected by the instrument of eddy covariance system but cannot be represented by the etr in the metric model this error was particularly evident in the summer of 2006 on the other hand the ec measurements would be affected by weather like precipitation and fog resulting in outliers or missing values foken and wichura 1996 and data quality would be degraded with artificial interpolation hu et al 2017 in general the error in daily et interpolated from the sequence of every eight days was acceptable we have compared the et of every eight days simulated by the swh model daily et simulated by the swh metric model and the ec measurements based on all indicators in table 3 after coupling the metric model the swh metric model didn t result in larger cumulative error and actually improved the simulation performance therefore in terms of the temporal resolution and accuracy of simulated et we believed that the swh metric model had better performance at the changwu station than swh model meanwhile we have also compared the spatial distribution of seasonal et in spring and summer in 2004 and 2007 in the lpns fig 8 the vegetation type in the lpns was mainly grasslands with parts of southern region covered by forest thus we chose the spring and summer to include the growing seasons from april to september fig 8 showed that evident differences existed in the spring of 2004 and the summer of 2007 based on the above analyses we prefer swh metric model to simulate regional et it is worth noting that the swh model only considered the water vapor flux from soil water evaporation and vegetation transpiration but neglected the water vapor flux from the canopy hu et al 2013 actually the canopy interception may still account for a considerable fraction of the total et especially in rainy days which could explain the underestimation in the swh metric model previous studies have also confirmed this issue hu et al 2009 2013 2017 wu et al 2016 5 conclusions the swh metric model developed in this study had good performance for the calculation of continuous daily actual et based on remote sensing image products and meteorological variables and it can produce satisfactory estimation of continuous et at the high spatiotemporal resolution with the temporal resolution of 1 day and the spatial resolution of 1 km therefore the swh metric model will be helpful to study the water use of vegetation at different growth stages and the water circulation in large scale areas and provide a basis for agricultural water use evaluation and management it is worth noting that some parameters in the swh metric model needs to be adjusted one method is to conduct parameter modulation based on the eddy flux data as this paper the other is based on remote sensing et products however the remote sensing et product itself may have inevitable errors and the performance of the final simulation may be poor therefore measured data are indispensable in this model parameters optimization based on the measurements is the basis of good agreement between the model and the measured data however optimal parameters for different ecosystems are not consistent which may lead to errors when the model is used for different ecosystems but simulated with fixed parameters how to alleviate the errors caused by the

5494,a distributed soil water balance model combined with a lumped karst groundwater model was developed aiming to simulate stream discharge in karst catchments both modelling frameworks which can be used separately are presented they were tested for the lauchert catchment in the south west of germany using radar based precipitation data with the focus on simulating flood events a soil water balance model with 100 m grid resolution was combined with groundwater model compartments on a subcatchment base for the catchment covering 450 km 2 results show good fits to observed runoff data and could be verified with soil moisture and groundwater level observations specifically spatially distributed precipitation data has proven to be very helpful for modelling local storm events which are often not captured by station based weather data the presented approach is a promising step towards an early warning system for floods in karst catchments keywords karst numerical modelling groundwater recharge floods radar precipitation data 1 introduction rising temperatures can accelerate the hydrologic cycle leading to changes in precipitation patterns and the water balance thus climate change is very likely to exert pressure on the hydrologic system increased flood frequencies are reported for various catchments in germany since the 1950s attributed to a change in climate petrow and merz 2009 this observed change in flood risks is likely to increase in the future considering climate change scenarios hattermann et al 2014 hattermann et al 2016 hattermann et al 2018 therefore hydrologic models will increasingly gain importance for the assessment of flood risks yet providing an adequate representation of karst areas by hydrologic models is still a challenging task due to their complex nature hartmann et al 2014 typical attributes of karstified regions are often difficult to implement some of these are water can usually percolate quickly resulting in quick groundwater recharge bakalowicz 2005 schiperski et al 2018 the highly dynamic stream flow is thus dominated by groundwater flow which is difficult to observe the subsurface catchment limits can differ significantly from the surface catchment and might vary depending on groundwater levels ford and williams 2007 white et al 2018 karst groundwater bodies exhibit a strong heterogeneity white et al 2018 pores and fine fractures with slow flow providing large storages are contrasted by a conduit system of dissolutionally enlarged shafts and fissures bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 allowing for quick drainage on a km scale as known from numerous tracer tests e g knöll and scheytt 2018 tranter et al 2017 zirlewagen et al 2016 such features limit the applicability of many hydrologic models which make rather simple assumptions with respect to groundwater flow and relate flow accumulation to topography jourde et al 2007 demonstrated that a standard rainfall runoff model fails to simulate a flood event in a karst catchment the state of baden württemberg currently does not publish flood forecasts for karst catchments for this reason a variety of modelling approaches are commonly applied to simulate karst hydrology these range from black box and lumped parameter models over to distributed modelling approaches hartmann et al 2014 and ghasemizadeh et al 2012 provide detailed reviews on these model types which are briefly discussed here black box models use empirical transfer functions to simulate the reaction of discharge and or groundwater levels from precipitation data an example is the use of machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural network approaches these have already been successfully applied to spring discharge simulations kong a siou et al 2014 sepúlveda 2009 flash flood simulations darras et al 2015 and forecasting johannet et al 2008 as well as groundwater level forecasting kong a siou et al 2014 wunsch et al 2018 although they may yield better results compared to other approaches kong a siou et al 2014 sepúlveda 2009 they are often viewed critically in light of their lack in being physically interpretable as physical processes are not accounted for explicitly they might lose their predictive power outside the range of their training data hartmann et al 2014 lumped models conceptualise a catchment into a number of reservoirs aiming at representing the average physical properties of different domains within a catchment hartmann et al 2014 since they are rather simple and have low requirements on necessary input data while still yielding satisfactory results such models are widely used some examples are the simulation of spring discharge for karst springs in the swabian alb geyer et al 2008 lauber et al 2013 croatia jukić and denić jukić 2009 and france tritz et al 2011 they are also applied to simulate flood events bovolin et al 2017 fleury et al 2013 due to their generalised nature these models cannot resolve the spatial variability within a model domain distributed models aim to simulate the physical processes involved in a 2d or 3d representation of the investigated area thus spatial variations of physical properties can be simulated models of this type have the potential to give a very detailed insight into the studied area yet this comes with the drawback of comparably high computational costs more importantly the models require a high amount of input data limiting their applicability to well explored test sites hartmann et al 2014 where the high amount of input data can be obtained an example of such a site is the gallusquelle spring catchment mohrlok 2014 doummar et al 2012 oehlmann et al 2015 in this study a distributed modelling approach was combined with a lumped approach and tested for a karst catchment in the swabian alb sw of germany the advantages of the both model types were combined by using a distributed approach where necessary input data is available and keeping it simple where information is scarce using a distributed approach for the surface and soil zone it is possible to take the spatial variability of land use and soil properties into account most importantly high spatial resolution radar based precipitation data can be used as input allowing to resolve the effect of local storm events on recharge generation within subsurface catchments where detailed information is scarce recharge is processed in a lumped way assuming that a flow accumulation and redistribution occurs within the subsurface catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling approach a distributed soil water balance model adapted to the specific needs for karst catchments was developed using the programming language python 2 7 it includes the simulation of snow pack canopy storage and soil storage the overall approach is similar to the lumped approach for recharge estimation used by geyer 2008 based on sauter 1992 in this case the term recharge refers to water passing from the soil zone into the karst system thus no longer being subject to evapotranspiration modelled recharge is then passed on to a lumped karst groundwater storage model for simulating spring discharge and stream flow different storage types can be chosen and combined allowing for the representation of a variety of conceptual models a simplified sketch of the coupled model is provided in fig 1 displaying the configuration adopted for this study 2 1 1 distributed soil water balance model for recharge simulations a soil water balance model was developed using the gdal api as an open source gis to process spatial data gdal ogr contributors 2018 the following paragraphs describe the calculations performed in this model all used parameters along with their abbreviations are listed in table 1 snow storage and melt whether precipitation p is registered as rain or as snow is controlled by the respective temperature hence at temperatures below 0 c precipitation is assumed to be snow and is added to the snow storage in order to account for height differences a height correction is applied to station based temperature data with a default gradient of 0 0065 k m 1 as proposed by jeffrey et al 2001 a degree day scheme is used for calculating snow melt sm from the snow storage sns at temperatures above 0 c eq 1 note that for all given equations the subscripts t and t 1 refer to the current and previous time step respectively units are mm water equivalent if not stated otherwise 1 sm t sm pot t t dd dt sns t sns t sm pot sns t canopy storage the maximum canopy storage capacity cc is determined as in eq 2 2 cc t lai t cv t lh 1 cv t lh where the dimensionless leaf area index lai and a percentage vegetation cover cv are used together with a maximum height of water on a leaf surface lh as a calibration parameter lai and cv are determined based on a method proposed by schulla 1997 which is implemented in the wasim eth model schulla and jasper 2007 in this method tabled values for lai and cv are given for certain breakpoints of the year depending on the land use type for every day of the year the respective values are linearly interpolated between these breakpoints the input values can be adapted depending on the climate zone or elevation water storage on the canopy cover cs is determined using eq 3 3 cs t c cs t 1 p t ec t 0 c cc cc c cc 0 c 0 evaporation from the canopy ec can maximally reach the value of cs or et pot at any given time step soil storage precipitation not held back by the canopy and snow melt is taken as the infiltration i component for the soil storage calculation to account for the presence of preferential flow paths in the soil layer a rapid recharge rr component is implemented rr occurs above a threshold value trr at a fixed fraction frr as depicted in eq 4 4 rr t i t trr frr i trr 0 i trr the remaining infiltration is added to the soil water storage ss whereas the actual evapotranspiration et a is subtracted from the storage 5 ss t ss t 1 i t rr t et a t et a is calculated based on the available moisture content in the soil storage functions for calculating et pot are implemented using the evaplib python library by maarten j waterloo which is based on allen et al 1998 water uptake from plants is known to reduce at increasingly dry conditions therefore et pot is decreased linearly between a threshold

is expressed as a fraction of the plant usable field capacity a dimensionless value between 0 and 1 serves as model input which is multiplied by plant usable field capacity for the whole model domain to obtain rc in mm generally the soil layer is able to store water until the field capacity fc is reached excess water is considered to be groundwater recharge r as described by eq 7 7 r ss t fc ss t fc 0 ss t fc overland flow and lateral flow components in the soil layer are neglected in this modelling approach due to generally high infiltration capacities in the studied area the two resulting recharge components can be used in groundwater models for further calculations 2 1 2 karst groundwater model a lumped karst groundwater model was developed to simulate water storage and transfer within karst catchments a variety of different storage types are available which can be freely chosen and interconnected according to the needs of the modelled system the model design used in the scope of this paper is followingly explained in detail a design with three storages was chosen in order to account for the aquifer heterogeneity representing the vadose zone the matrix and the conduits respectively all parameters used are listed in table 2 storage calculations used for this paper are all based on the maillet equation maillet 1905 8 q t q 0 e α t where q is the discharge from the storage and α is the recession coefficient the storage calculation terms have the following general form 9 v t v t 1 q in t q out t where v refers to the stored water volume in m 3 inflow q in and outflow q out of the storage for each time step are also given in m 3 per step vadose zone storage all recharge is taken as inflow for the storage representing the vadose zone due to the duality of karst groundwater flow specifically the highly conductive shafts and the far less permeable network of small fractures and pores two types of outflow from the storage are considered a slow and a fast component poulain et al 2018 gives an extensive review on the importance of the vadose zone storage and highlights the duality of flow the calculation of the quick component is done using eq 10 10 q v q t v t 1 r t rr t f t α v q dt where f is the fraction of volume in the storage contributing to quick flow between 0 and 1 the slow component is calculated according to eq 11 here the entire storage volume contributes to discharge generation 11 q v s t v t 1 r t rr t α v s dt the fraction f is determined dynamically in each iteration controlled by a limit volume v l as an input parameter 12 f t v t v l v t v l 1 v t v l thus with an increase in storage volume there is a linear increase of the fraction contributing to the quick discharge component this design is based on the idea that as the amount of water in the vadose zone increases the amount of water accumulated and drained by highly conductive features such as vertical shafts and karst conduits also increases phreatic zone storage the phreatic zone is represented by two kinds of storages each having its own recession eqs 8 and 9 one has a slow recession representing the matrix system the other has a quick recession representing the conduit system while the slow vadose outflow component is treated as the matrix inflow the quick vadose outflow component is passed directly on to the conduit storage outflow of the matrix storage is also passed on to the conduit storage flow towards a deeper aquifer is not considered the outflow of the conduit storage is treated as discharge to streams routing if there is a stream flow into the modelled subcatchment the flow is routed using a single storage with recession eqs 8 and 9 the total system outflow is the sum of routed flow and conduit outflow 2 2 study site the study area is located in the swabian alb sw germany see overview map in fig 2 we studied the river lauchert and its tributaries the average stream discharge at the outlet is 4 3 m 3 s 1 with the first second and third quartile being 2 5 m 3 s 1 3 6 m 3 s 1 and 5 5 m 3 s 1 respectively period 1980 2019 the catchment is located in a rural low mountain range dominated by forests grassland and agricultural areas annual precipitation ranges from 793 mm station 4703 in fig 2 in the south to 929 mm station 2292 in fig 2 in the north east with precipitation throughout the year and its maximum in winter period 1981 2010 dwd climate data center 2019d total precipitation generally increases with altitude a thin loamy soil layer with good drainage properties covering elevated plains and slopes is abundant in the study area only within depressions thicker soil layers can be expected lgrb bw 2012 the surface catchment s area is 450 km 2 with altitudes ranging from 560 to 940 masl the subsurface catchment is estimated to be approximately 30 km 2 smaller donau and bodensee 2004 villinger 1969 though the exact location of the eastern limit is rather uncertain as indicated in fig 2 the karstified groundwater body is comprised of upper jurassic limestones slightly dipping south east as an overview a cross section of the area is shown in fig 3 the aquifer base is formed by oxfordian marls in the northern part of the study area kimmeridgian marls were found to be partly permeable in this area landesanstalt and messungen baden württemberg 2009 towards the south their depths increase to approximately 150 m below stream level see cross section in knöll and scheytt 2018 due to this the kimmeridgian marls are considered as the aquifer base in the southern part of the study area landesanstalt and messungen baden württemberg 2009 in the north west of the study area the oxfordian marls lie at shallow depths being even partly exposed in a valley consequently distance to groundwater and aquifer thickness are low in these areas they are viewed as a transition zone to shallow karst hahn 1975 with one spring catchment counting as shallow karst geyer 1995 accordingly hydrographs in this part of the study area show fast reactions to storm events with pronounced flood peaks and a quick recession behaviour during dry periods the upper reach of the river lauchert can fall dry see fig 2 in the central and southern parts of the catchment the aquifer thickness amounts to several tens of meters and the vadose zone can reach a thickness of approximately 100 m as seen from groundwater level observations this setting leads to more dampened reactions to recharge events and a more stable baseflow compared to the north west drainage is controlled by a number of karst springs the largest being the gallusquelle spring the catchment of this well studied spring comprises approximately 10 of the study area with discharge dynamics being similar to the outlet of the lauchert river catchment sauter 1992 2 2 1 field data in the river lauchert itself there are three gauging stations one each in the upper central and lower part of the river additionally the gallusquelle spring is being gauged all gauges measure water levels in a 15 min interval which are transferred to discharges with rating curves unpublished data from all gauging stations in the study area were provided by the landesanstalt für umwelt baden württemberg long term time series from groundwater observation wells are available as well landesanstalt für umwelt messungen und naturschutz baden württemberg 2019 furthermore tdr probes were installed for in situ soil moisture observations within the catchment decacon 5te sensors the locations of all observation sites are depicted in fig 2 sensors were distributed over the soil zone with a sensor at 0 1 and 0 3 m in every location and one in a depth of 0 5 m at location s3 due to a higher soil depth at this point an overview of the data sources used for modelling subsection 2 1 is provided in table 1 water storage in the soil zone is based on the wielding point and the field capacity the respective data was obtained from a digital soil map lgrb bw 2012 yielding parameter ranges for these values field measurements of soil properties imply that the lower range of the given values are the most realistic ones within the studied area information on land use was obtained from a reclassification of the corine land cover product european environment agency 2016 input precipitation data for modelling can be both raster and station based here the radolan product served as input dwd climate data center 2019b it is a quantitative radar based precipitation raster covering germany with a 1 1 km grid which is fitted to station based data bartels et al 2004 only if a dataset was corrupted or missing the respective station based precipitation data was used from weather stations of the german weather service in the vicinity of the study area dwd climate data center 2019c in this case a gridded dataset of the et pot was used as a reference for et the dataset is based on the ambav model löpmeier 1994 2 3 model application the modelling approach subsection 2 1 was tested by applying it to the whole subsurface catchment of the river lauchert the soil water balance model was applied having a 100 100 m grid and a daily time step for each subcatchment the resulting groundwater recharge was then passed on to a lumped karst groundwater storage model these are interconnected as shown in fig 4 2 3 1 calibration validation and verification calibration was done in several steps using the spotpy library houska et al 2015 an open source parameter estimation tool with a variety of implemented algorithms the rope algorithm in combination with the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse as an objective function was used for calibration the nse is commonly used to evaluate hydrologic models and is known to be sensitive with respect to peak flows krause et al 2005 additionally the kling gupta efficiency kge was calculated gupta et al 2009 as an objective function being less sensitive to high flow conditions first a coupled soil water and groundwater model was set up for the gallusquelle spring catchment and calibrated against measured spring discharge for the remaining subcatchments parameters for the soil moisture model were assumed to be equal to those of the gallusquelle spring catchment thus only the karst groundwater models for each subcatchment were calibrated against the respective measured discharges using recharge from the soil moisture model as input if a stream inflow from an upper subcatchment was present measured data was used as upstream inflow in order to avoid error propagation each calibration had a warm up phase of one year assuming a fully filled soil storage at the first step and starting on january 2010 the calibration period extended over five years 2011 2015 followed by a validation period of three years and four months 2016 april 2019 this period was chosen to include flood events as well as dry periods both in summer and winter to verify the results of the calibrated soil water balance model the measured soil moisture was compared to modelled data of the corresponding grid cells in order to obtain comparable values the field data on volumetric water content of individual sensors needed to be depth integrated and scaled to the corresponding model grid cell additionally the modelled groundwater storage volumes were related to measured groundwater levels by a linear regression with this regression theoretical groundwater levels were derived from storage volumes representing the average in the corresponding subcatchment 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation the modelling approach was generally applicable to the distinct subunits in the study area firstly to the north west where discharge occurs as pronounced peaks due to a comparably shallow karst system with low thickness secondly to areas further south which exhibit massive unsaturated zones and by far larger groundwater bodies the results for all gauged subcatchments are shown in fig 5 all model parameters resulting from calibration can be found in the supplements the obtained nse values range from 0 61 to 0 95 for the individual subcatchments and remained stable in the validation period in all cases see table 3 also the kge values shown in table 3 are in a satisfactory range and mostly even slightly improve during the validation period thus calibration resulted in generally good fits for all subcatchments it was possible to reproduce the general dynamics of the spring discharges as well as for the stream runoff fig 5 larger deviations between measured and modelled discharges can be seen in autumn and winter of 2013 14 and 2014 15 at the gallusquelle spring fig 5b this could possibly be caused by deficiencies in the snow melt routine yet for the other subcatchments such deviations cannot be observed during the same period another possible explanation could be that the extreme flood event in summer 2013 temporarily changed the flow pattern a flood could have the potential to temporarily flush certain conduits which are known to exist below the gauge sauter 1992 by freeing them from sediments an abrupt drop in measured discharge can be noted in the gauge mägerkingen in the end of 2016 which is related to construction works in the river bed above the gauge these are not accounted for in the model and thus are not reproduced the use of radar based precipitation rasters as input proved to be advantageous in order to determine the effect of local storm events in the beginning of june 2018 two consecutive storm events led to an average precipitation of 74 mm in the area of the gallusquelle catchment over the course of 24 h the other subcatchments were only slightly affected by these events as seen in figs 5c and 6 the pronounced flood peak triggered by precipitation of this event was adequately reproduced while not being present in the neighbouring subcatchments fig 5a and b by using only station based precipitation data it was not possible to capture and reproduce this flood peak with models fig 6 since the event s intensity was not registered at any weather station in general both nse and kge deteriorate significantly using only station based data as model input compared to the radar based results for almost all subcatchments values are provided as supplement utilising the storage volume dependent fractionation of the vadose flow into a quick and slow component it was possible to account for the duality of flow in the vadose zone this creates a damping effect with regards to recharge events after longer dry periods while also allowing for quick reactions after longer wet periods this behaviour can neither be reproduced if the vadose zone is neglected in the modelling settings nor if only a single vadose storage is used where rr is passed directly on to the conduit system a related approach is the use of a hysteresis function as shown for epikarst storages poulain et al 2018 tritz et al 2011 3 2 verification a comparison of measured snow heights with the modelled snow water equivalents at two points figs 7 and supplement d was performed data was derived from dwd climate data center dwd climate data center 2019a the locations are marked in fig 2 the general snow accumulation and melt pattern matches mostly well in both cases except for a large outlier in 2012 note that the two scales of the diagrams are produced in order to match at a snow density 0 1 g cm 3 which is reasonable for fresh snow but not necessarily for a mature snow pack consequently the patterns are only a qualitative indicator since snow density of the measured snow heights is unknown and can therefore not directly be transferred to snow water equivalent the modelled soil moisture was compared to in situ measurements measurements are available for periods since february 2016 the simulated dynamics correspond well to measurements as shown in fig 8 for all three observation points the correlation coefficients of the modelled and measured data range from 0 71 to 0 84 thus it can be assumed that the chosen modelling approach with the parameter set derived from calibration is a reasonable representation of processes controlling soil storage and recharge a possible cause for deviation is the scale difference between measured and modelled data also the modelled groundwater storage corresponds well to measured changes in groundwater levels a linear regression of both yields a theoretical average porosity of 1 7 this value is in accordance with previous works reporting values ranging from 1 to 3 for the area strayle 1970 sauter 1992 using this regression the theoretical groundwater level changes were calculated from modelled storage volumes in the corresponding catchment as shown in fig 9 from this comparison it becomes obvious that storage changes can be closely related to measured groundwater changes despite the simplicity of the model similarly to the modelled discharges storage volumes seem to be overestimated in the simulations for the winters 2013 14 and 2014 15 for the gallusquelle spring values of recession coefficients of the conduit system have been reported in the literature sauter 1992 states a value of 0 25 day 1 geyer et al 2008 state values of 0 3 and 0 5 day 1 obtained from tracer tests using the same method on more recent tracer tests yields recession coefficients of 0 29 day 1 schiperski et al 2016 and 0 3 day 1 tranter et al 2017 the value of 0 23 day 1 α c obtained from calibration in this study is in a reasonable range of these values especially considering that the model value represents the whole conduit system and not only the part affected by the respective tracer test 3 3 outlook and limitations in the setting chosen for the current study a vertical separation into the soil vadose and phreatic zone was sufficient yet for some more complex cases a further vertical layering might be of interest a model design with a more complex layering can be build with the software used in any case further tests and detailed parameter studies should be done when implementing the software as demonstrated by meeks et al 2017 for a low alpine area the choice of snowpack model can introduce significant uncertainties in our case the choice of the snow pack modelling approach was restricted by available input data due to the unknown snow density in the field data only a qualitative comparison of modelled and measured data was possible with more detailed data resulting from a newly installed weather station network a deeper insight into this issue will be possible by using these data in calibration processes for a further investigation of the study area it would also be useful to test different model structures and levels of complexity as in coron et al 2012 or moeck et al 2016 these approaches could help investigate the model performance as well as the robustness of calibration results in the light of changing climate conditions 4 conclusions the developed models were successfully tested for a karst catchment in the south west of germany the chosen distributed soil water balance approach allowed for spatial variations to be taken into account in the process of recharge generation especially the method of utilising radar based precipitation rasters has proven to be particularly useful for simulating the reaction of subcatchments to small scale storm events using a lumped approach on the subcatchment scale for modelling groundwater storage and discharge generation nevertheless keeps the computational costs low thereby fostering applicability furthermore stream discharge was successfully reproduced with simulations despite focusing solely on groundwater flow this emphasizes the dominant role of groundwater flow with regards to discharge generation in karst catchments if real time measurements and weather forecast data can be included the presented tools are a promising way towards a flood warning system for karst catchments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

5494,a distributed soil water balance model combined with a lumped karst groundwater model was developed aiming to simulate stream discharge in karst catchments both modelling frameworks which can be used separately are presented they were tested for the lauchert catchment in the south west of germany using radar based precipitation data with the focus on simulating flood events a soil water balance model with 100 m grid resolution was combined with groundwater model compartments on a subcatchment base for the catchment covering 450 km 2 results show good fits to observed runoff data and could be verified with soil moisture and groundwater level observations specifically spatially distributed precipitation data has proven to be very helpful for modelling local storm events which are often not captured by station based weather data the presented approach is a promising step towards an early warning system for floods in karst catchments keywords karst numerical modelling groundwater recharge floods radar precipitation data 1 introduction rising temperatures can accelerate the hydrologic cycle leading to changes in precipitation patterns and the water balance thus climate change is very likely to exert pressure on the hydrologic system increased flood frequencies are reported for various catchments in germany since the 1950s attributed to a change in climate petrow and merz 2009 this observed change in flood risks is likely to increase in the future considering climate change scenarios hattermann et al 2014 hattermann et al 2016 hattermann et al 2018 therefore hydrologic models will increasingly gain importance for the assessment of flood risks yet providing an adequate representation of karst areas by hydrologic models is still a challenging task due to their complex nature hartmann et al 2014 typical attributes of karstified regions are often difficult to implement some of these are water can usually percolate quickly resulting in quick groundwater recharge bakalowicz 2005 schiperski et al 2018 the highly dynamic stream flow is thus dominated by groundwater flow which is difficult to observe the subsurface catchment limits can differ significantly from the surface catchment and might vary depending on groundwater levels ford and williams 2007 white et al 2018 karst groundwater bodies exhibit a strong heterogeneity white et al 2018 pores and fine fractures with slow flow providing large storages are contrasted by a conduit system of dissolutionally enlarged shafts and fissures bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 allowing for quick drainage on a km scale as known from numerous tracer tests e g knöll and scheytt 2018 tranter et al 2017 zirlewagen et al 2016 such features limit the applicability of many hydrologic models which make rather simple assumptions with respect to groundwater flow and relate flow accumulation to topography jourde et al 2007 demonstrated that a standard rainfall runoff model fails to simulate a flood event in a karst catchment the state of baden württemberg currently does not publish flood forecasts for karst catchments for this reason a variety of modelling approaches are commonly applied to simulate karst hydrology these range from black box and lumped parameter models over to distributed modelling approaches hartmann et al 2014 and ghasemizadeh et al 2012 provide detailed reviews on these model types which are briefly discussed here black box models use empirical transfer functions to simulate the reaction of discharge and or groundwater levels from precipitation data an example is the use of machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural network approaches these have already been successfully applied to spring discharge simulations kong a siou et al 2014 sepúlveda 2009 flash flood simulations darras et al 2015 and forecasting johannet et al 2008 as well as groundwater level forecasting kong a siou et al 2014 wunsch et al 2018 although they may yield better results compared to other approaches kong a siou et al 2014 sepúlveda 2009 they are often viewed critically in light of their lack in being physically interpretable as physical processes are not accounted for explicitly they might lose their predictive power outside the range of their training data hartmann et al 2014 lumped models conceptualise a catchment into a number of reservoirs aiming at representing the average physical properties of different domains within a catchment hartmann et al 2014 since they are rather simple and have low requirements on necessary input data while still yielding satisfactory results such models are widely used some examples are the simulation of spring discharge for karst springs in the swabian alb geyer et al 2008 lauber et al 2013 croatia jukić and denić jukić 2009 and france tritz et al 2011 they are also applied to simulate flood events bovolin et al 2017 fleury et al 2013 due to their generalised nature these models cannot resolve the spatial variability within a model domain distributed models aim to simulate the physical processes involved in a 2d or 3d representation of the investigated area thus spatial variations of physical properties can be simulated models of this type have the potential to give a very detailed insight into the studied area yet this comes with the drawback of comparably high computational costs more importantly the models require a high amount of input data limiting their applicability to well explored test sites hartmann et al 2014 where the high amount of input data can be obtained an example of such a site is the gallusquelle spring catchment mohrlok 2014 doummar et al 2012 oehlmann et al 2015 in this study a distributed modelling approach was combined with a lumped approach and tested for a karst catchment in the swabian alb sw of germany the advantages of the both model types were combined by using a distributed approach where necessary input data is available and keeping it simple where information is scarce using a distributed approach for the surface and soil zone it is possible to take the spatial variability of land use and soil properties into account most importantly high spatial resolution radar based precipitation data can be used as input allowing to resolve the effect of local storm events on recharge generation within subsurface catchments where detailed information is scarce recharge is processed in a lumped way assuming that a flow accumulation and redistribution occurs within the subsurface catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling

and a fast component poulain et al 2018 gives an extensive review on the importance of the vadose zone storage and highlights the duality of flow the calculation of the quick component is done using eq 10 10 q v q t v t 1 r t rr t f t α v q dt where f is the fraction of volume in the storage contributing to quick flow between 0 and 1 the slow component is calculated according to eq 11 here the entire storage volume contributes to discharge generation 11 q v s t v t 1 r t rr t α v s dt the fraction f is determined dynamically in each iteration controlled by a limit volume v l as an input parameter 12 f t v t v l v t v l 1 v t v l thus with an increase in storage volume there is a linear increase of the fraction contributing to the quick discharge component this design is based on the idea that as the amount of water in the vadose zone increases the amount of water accumulated and drained by highly conductive features such as vertical shafts and karst conduits also increases phreatic zone storage the phreatic zone is represented by two kinds of storages each having its own recession eqs 8 and 9 one has a slow recession representing the matrix system the other has a quick recession representing the conduit system while the slow vadose outflow component is treated as the matrix inflow the quick vadose outflow component is passed directly on to the conduit storage outflow of the matrix storage is also passed on to the conduit storage flow towards a deeper aquifer is not considered the outflow of the conduit storage is treated as discharge to streams routing if there is a stream flow into the modelled subcatchment the flow is routed using a single storage with recession eqs 8 and 9 the total system outflow is the sum of routed flow and conduit outflow 2 2 study site the study area is located in the swabian alb sw germany see overview map in fig 2 we studied the river lauchert and its tributaries the average stream discharge at the outlet is 4 3 m 3 s 1 with the first second and third quartile being 2 5 m 3 s 1 3 6 m 3 s 1 and 5 5 m 3 s 1 respectively period 1980 2019 the catchment is located in a rural low mountain range dominated by forests grassland and agricultural areas annual precipitation ranges from 793 mm station 4703 in fig 2 in the south to 929 mm station 2292 in fig 2 in the north east with precipitation throughout the year and its maximum in winter period 1981 2010 dwd climate data center 2019d total precipitation generally increases with altitude a thin loamy soil layer with good drainage properties covering elevated plains and slopes is abundant in the study area only within depressions thicker soil layers can be expected lgrb bw 2012 the surface catchment s area is 450 km 2 with altitudes ranging from 560 to 940 masl the subsurface catchment is estimated to be approximately 30 km 2 smaller donau and bodensee 2004 villinger 1969 though the exact location of the eastern limit is rather uncertain as indicated in fig 2 the karstified groundwater body is comprised of upper jurassic limestones slightly dipping south east as an overview a cross section of the area is shown in fig 3 the aquifer base is formed by oxfordian marls in the northern part of the study area kimmeridgian marls were found to be partly permeable in this area landesanstalt and messungen baden württemberg 2009 towards the south their depths increase to approximately 150 m below stream level see cross section in knöll and scheytt 2018 due to this the kimmeridgian marls are considered as the aquifer base in the southern part of the study area landesanstalt and messungen baden württemberg 2009 in the north west of the study area the oxfordian marls lie at shallow depths being even partly exposed in a valley consequently distance to groundwater and aquifer thickness are low in these areas they are viewed as a transition zone to shallow karst hahn 1975 with one spring catchment counting as shallow karst geyer 1995 accordingly hydrographs in this part of the study area show fast reactions to storm events with pronounced flood peaks and a quick recession behaviour during dry periods the upper reach of the river lauchert can fall dry see fig 2 in the central and southern parts of the catchment the aquifer thickness amounts to several tens of meters and the vadose zone can reach a thickness of approximately 100 m as seen from groundwater level observations this setting leads to more dampened reactions to recharge events and a more stable baseflow compared to the north west drainage is controlled by a number of karst springs the largest being the gallusquelle spring the catchment of this well studied spring comprises approximately 10 of the study area with discharge dynamics being similar to the outlet of the lauchert river catchment sauter 1992 2 2 1 field data in the river lauchert itself there are three gauging stations one each in the upper central and lower part of the river additionally the gallusquelle spring is being gauged all gauges measure water levels in a 15 min interval which are transferred to discharges with rating curves unpublished data from all gauging stations in the study area were provided by the landesanstalt für umwelt baden württemberg long term time series from groundwater observation wells are available as well landesanstalt für umwelt messungen und naturschutz baden württemberg 2019 furthermore tdr probes were installed for in situ soil moisture observations within the catchment decacon 5te sensors the locations of all observation sites are depicted in fig 2 sensors were distributed over the soil zone with a sensor at 0 1 and 0 3 m in every location and one in a depth of 0 5 m at location s3 due to a higher soil depth at this point an overview of the data sources used for modelling subsection 2 1 is provided in table 1 water storage in the soil zone is based on the wielding point and the field capacity the respective data was obtained from a digital soil map lgrb bw 2012 yielding parameter ranges for these values field measurements of soil properties imply that the lower range of the given values are the most realistic ones within the studied area information on land use was obtained from a reclassification of the corine land cover product european environment agency 2016 input precipitation data for modelling can be both raster and station based here the radolan product served as input dwd climate data center 2019b it is a quantitative radar based precipitation raster covering germany with a 1 1 km grid which is fitted to station based data bartels et al 2004 only if a dataset was corrupted or missing the respective station based precipitation data was used from weather stations of the german weather service in the vicinity of the study area dwd climate data center 2019c in this case a gridded dataset of the et pot was used as a reference for et the dataset is based on the ambav model löpmeier 1994 2 3 model application the modelling approach subsection 2 1 was tested by applying it to the whole subsurface catchment of the river lauchert the soil water balance model was applied having a 100 100 m grid and a daily time step for each subcatchment the resulting groundwater recharge was then passed on to a lumped karst groundwater storage model these are interconnected as shown in fig 4 2 3 1 calibration validation and verification calibration was done in several steps using the spotpy library houska et al 2015 an open source parameter estimation tool with a variety of implemented algorithms the rope algorithm in combination with the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse as an objective function was used for calibration the nse is commonly used to evaluate hydrologic models and is known to be sensitive with respect to peak flows krause et al 2005 additionally the kling gupta efficiency kge was calculated gupta et al 2009 as an objective function being less sensitive to high flow conditions first a coupled soil water and groundwater model was set up for the gallusquelle spring catchment and calibrated against measured spring discharge for the remaining subcatchments parameters for the soil moisture model were assumed to be equal to those of the gallusquelle spring catchment thus only the karst groundwater models for each subcatchment were calibrated against the respective measured discharges using recharge from the soil moisture model as input if a stream inflow from an upper subcatchment was present measured data was used as upstream inflow in order to avoid error propagation each calibration had a warm up phase of one year assuming a fully filled soil storage at the first step and starting on january 2010 the calibration period extended over five years 2011 2015 followed by a validation period of three years and four months 2016 april 2019 this period was chosen to include flood events as well as dry periods both in summer and winter to verify the results of the calibrated soil water balance model the measured soil moisture was compared to modelled data of the corresponding grid cells in order to obtain comparable values the field data on volumetric water content of individual sensors needed to be depth integrated and scaled to the corresponding model grid cell additionally the modelled groundwater storage volumes were related to measured groundwater levels by a linear regression with this regression theoretical groundwater levels were derived from storage volumes representing the average in the corresponding subcatchment 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation the modelling approach was generally applicable to the distinct subunits in the study area firstly to the north west where discharge occurs as pronounced peaks due to a comparably shallow karst system with low thickness secondly to areas further south which exhibit massive unsaturated zones and by far larger groundwater bodies the results for all gauged subcatchments are shown in fig 5 all model parameters resulting from calibration can be found in the supplements the obtained nse values range from 0 61 to 0 95 for the individual subcatchments and remained stable in the validation period in all cases see table 3 also the kge values shown in table 3 are in a satisfactory range and mostly even slightly improve during the validation period thus calibration resulted in generally good fits for all subcatchments it was possible to reproduce the general dynamics of the spring discharges as well as for the stream runoff fig 5 larger deviations between measured and modelled discharges can be seen in autumn and winter of 2013 14 and 2014 15 at the gallusquelle spring fig 5b this could possibly be caused by deficiencies in the snow melt routine yet for the other subcatchments such deviations cannot be observed during the same period another possible explanation could be that the extreme flood event in summer 2013 temporarily changed the flow pattern a flood could have the potential to temporarily flush certain conduits which are known to exist below the gauge sauter 1992 by freeing them from sediments an abrupt drop in measured discharge can be noted in the gauge mägerkingen in the end of 2016 which is related to construction works in the river bed above the gauge these are not accounted for in the model and thus are not reproduced the use of radar based precipitation rasters as input proved to be advantageous in order to determine the effect of local storm events in the beginning of june 2018 two consecutive storm events led to an average precipitation of 74 mm in the area of the gallusquelle catchment over the course of 24 h the other subcatchments were only slightly affected by these events as seen in figs 5c and 6 the pronounced flood peak triggered by precipitation of this event was adequately reproduced while not being present in the neighbouring subcatchments fig 5a and b by using only station based precipitation data it was not possible to capture and reproduce this flood peak with models fig 6 since the event s intensity was not registered at any weather station in general both nse and kge deteriorate significantly using only station based data as model input compared to the radar based results for almost all subcatchments values are provided as supplement utilising the storage volume dependent fractionation of the vadose flow into a quick and slow component it was possible to account for the duality of flow in the vadose zone this creates a damping effect with regards to recharge events after longer dry periods while also allowing for quick reactions after longer wet periods this behaviour can neither be reproduced if the vadose zone is neglected in the modelling settings nor if only a single vadose storage is used where rr is passed directly on to the conduit system a related approach is the use of a hysteresis function as shown for epikarst storages poulain et al 2018 tritz et al 2011 3 2 verification a comparison of measured snow heights with the modelled snow water equivalents at two points figs 7 and supplement d was performed data was derived from dwd climate data center dwd climate data center 2019a the locations are marked in fig 2 the general snow accumulation and melt pattern matches mostly well in both cases except for a large outlier in 2012 note that the two scales of the diagrams are produced in order to match at a snow density 0 1 g cm 3 which is reasonable for fresh snow but not necessarily for a mature snow pack consequently the patterns are only a qualitative indicator since snow density of the measured snow heights is unknown and can therefore not directly be transferred to snow water equivalent the modelled soil moisture was compared to in situ measurements measurements are available for periods since february 2016 the simulated dynamics correspond well to measurements as shown in fig 8 for all three observation points the correlation coefficients of the modelled and measured data range from 0 71 to 0 84 thus it can be assumed that the chosen modelling approach with the parameter set derived from calibration is a reasonable representation of processes controlling soil storage and recharge a possible cause for deviation is the scale difference between measured and modelled data also the modelled groundwater storage corresponds well to measured changes in groundwater levels a linear regression of both yields a theoretical average porosity of 1 7 this value is in accordance with previous works reporting values ranging from 1 to 3 for the area strayle 1970 sauter 1992 using this regression the theoretical groundwater level changes were calculated from modelled storage volumes in the corresponding catchment as shown in fig 9 from this comparison it becomes obvious that storage changes can be closely related to measured groundwater changes despite the simplicity of the model similarly to the modelled discharges storage volumes seem to be overestimated in the simulations for the winters 2013 14 and 2014 15 for the gallusquelle spring values of recession coefficients of the conduit system have been reported in the literature sauter 1992 states a value of 0 25 day 1 geyer et al 2008 state values of 0 3 and 0 5 day 1 obtained from tracer tests using the same method on more recent tracer tests yields recession coefficients of 0 29 day 1 schiperski et al 2016 and 0 3 day 1 tranter et al 2017 the value of 0 23 day 1 α c obtained from calibration in this study is in a reasonable range of these values especially considering that the model value represents the whole conduit system and not only the part affected by the respective tracer test 3 3 outlook and limitations in the setting chosen for the current study a vertical separation into the soil vadose and phreatic zone was sufficient yet for some more complex cases a further vertical layering might be of interest a model design with a more complex layering can be build with the software used in any case further tests and detailed parameter studies should be done when implementing the software as demonstrated by meeks et al 2017 for a low alpine area the choice of snowpack model can introduce significant uncertainties in our case the choice of the snow pack modelling approach was restricted by available input data due to the unknown snow density in the field data only a qualitative comparison of modelled and measured data was possible with more detailed data resulting from a newly installed weather station network a deeper insight into this issue will be possible by using these data in calibration processes for a further investigation of the study area it would also be useful to test different model structures and levels of complexity as in coron et al 2012 or moeck et al 2016 these approaches could help investigate the model performance as well as the robustness of calibration results in the light of changing climate conditions 4 conclusions the developed models were successfully tested for a karst catchment in the south west of germany the chosen distributed soil water balance approach allowed for spatial variations to be taken into account in the process of recharge generation especially the method of utilising radar based precipitation rasters has proven to be particularly useful for simulating the reaction of subcatchments to small scale storm events using a lumped approach on the subcatchment scale for modelling groundwater storage and discharge generation nevertheless keeps the computational costs low thereby fostering applicability furthermore stream discharge was successfully reproduced with simulations despite focusing solely on groundwater flow this emphasizes the dominant role of groundwater flow with regards to discharge generation in karst catchments if real time measurements and weather forecast data can be included the presented tools are a promising way towards a flood warning system for karst catchments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
