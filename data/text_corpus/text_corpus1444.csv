7220,under the impact of intensive anthropogenic activities and in the context of global climate change the hydromorphological processes of most lakes around the world have changed dramatically here based on hydrologic and topographic data we analyzed secular variations in hydromorphological characteristics and their influencing factors at dongting lake the second largest freshwater lake in china the entire time series 1951 2014 was divided into four subperiods based on the anthropogenic modifications of the changjiang yangtze river including the construction of the lower jingjiang cutoff project and the operation of the gezhou dam gd and the three gorges dam tgd the results indicated that there were obvious stepwise decreasing trends in the annual water discharge and suspended sediment discharge ssd from 1951 to 2014 seasonal differences in water discharge and ssd over the recent 60 years exhibited a tendency of less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season meanwhile the deposition erosion budget of dongting lake shifted from a deposition rate of 120 106 t yr from 1951 to 2003 to an erosion rate of 2 106 t yr with the serious degradation of the ouchi and xiangjiang deltas after 2003 the hydrological processes of dongting lake are dominated by different anthropogenic activities at different stages the jingjiang cutoff project is the main driver of the decreases in water discharge and ssd from 1967 to 1980 the operation of the gd along the changjiang river and other reservoirs as well as land use changes in the dongting lake basin should be responsible for the hydrological variations from 1981 to 2003 the high sediment retention rate geometric adjustment of the channel and flow regulation induced by the operation of the tgd are the main drivers for the hydromorphological variations in dongting lake in 2004 2014 keywords hydromorphological processes water and sediment budgets anthropogenic activities dongting lake changjiang yangtze river 1 introduction there are 250 lakes with a surface area of more than 500 km2 around the world and they occupy only a tiny part of earth s total land herdendorf 1982 lehner and d√∂ll 2004 nonetheless all of these lakes play an important role in maintaining regional and global ecosystem diversity as well as providing basic survival conditions for humans such as the water supply economic resources and even flood control kummu et al 2011 however most large lakes around the world are undergoing expansion or shrinking processes under the context of global climate change and anthropogenic activities examples include the majority of lakes in tibet twelve mile lake in the usa lake chad in africa and lake urmia in iran bianduo et al 2009 lemoalle et al 2012 jepsen et al 2013 alizadeh choobari et al 2016 dongting lake which is the second largest freshwater lake in china with an area of 2623 km2 and a volume of 16 7 109 m3 joins the middle changjiang yangtze river from the south the lake directly gets 75 of its sediment and 34 of its water from the changjiang river and is of vital significance for buffering flooding along the middle lower changjiang river nakayama and watanabe 2008 wang et al 2011 located in a vast floodplain dongting lake feeds a population of millions zhou et al 2016 and the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake therefore directly reflect the history of human anthropogenic activities following the principle of taking steel as the key link taking grain as the key link over one third of lakes in the changjiang river basin were reclaimed to plow land accompanied by serious deforestation and soil erosion during the 1950s 1970s and dongting lake is no exception indicating that it has experienced dramatic deposition yin and li 2001 xiang et al 2003 meanwhile the lower jingjiang ouchikou chenglingji cutoff project was implemented from 1967 to 1972 to improve the flood control capacity and navigation conditions of the changjiang river the shortened river length and decreasing sinuosity in the jingjiang reach have altered the relationship between the changjiang river and dongting lake yin et al 2007 subsequently a large number of dams were constructed in the changjiang river basin and dongting lake system after the 1980s including the most obvious examples of the gezhou dam gd and the three gorges dam tgd the gd which is located in yichang at the beginning of the middle changjiang river was operated in january 1981 with a storage capacity of 15 8 108 m3 following the operation of the gd heavy siltation was detected in the region upstream of the dam site while the riverbed below the dam experienced erosion chen et al 2007 the heavy sediment trapping of the dam and further riverbed scouring after the implementation of the lower jingjiang cutoff project both decreased the sediment load from the changjiang river to dongting lake yin et al 2007 notwithstanding the significant decreases in inflow water and sediment following those previous anthropogenic modifications after the 1970s dongting lake still maintained its deposition pattern yin et al 2007 the history of deposition in dongting lake however was completely changed after the operation of the tgd the tgd which is currently the world s largest dam and is located along the upper reaches of the changjiang river has been in operation since 2003 and has had significant impacts on the hydrological regime in the middle and lower reaches dai and liu 2013 mei et al 2015 2018 li et al 2016 with a large amount of sediment trapped in the reservoir the ssd from the changjiang river into the east china sea has dropped from 423 106 t yr to less than 135 106 t yr the downstream riverbed has transformed from experiencing seasonal erosion to year round erosion and the sediment carrying capacity below the dam has been greatly reduced dai et al 2016 lai et al 2017 the alteration of river discharge and sediment transport in the changjiang river resulted in the adjustment of dongting lake dai and liu 2013 therefore there are increasing concerns regarding the impact of the tgd on the hydrological processes of dongting lake some research has indicated that the construction of the tgd was the dominant factor in the prolonged duration of low water levels and the declined inundation area of dongting lake lai et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 deng et al 2012 showed that the replenishment ability of the changjiang river in extreme drought years was higher than normal despite decreasing flow and sediment diversion at the three inlets i e the entrance of the changjiang river meanwhile recent studies have argued that dongting lake changed from exhibiting high siltation to erosion due to a tgd induced decrease in the fluvial sediment supply yin et al 2007 zhu et al 2014 which can significantly affect the lacustrine delta system xia et al 2017 indicated that the channel variation in the jingjiang reach of the changjiang river tended to be influential in the discharge and flood discharge capacity of the lake because they represent a complicated hydrographic net when referring to hydromorphological alteration the impacts of the main tributaries of the lake should not be neglected furthermore the alteration of the hydrology and geomorphology of dongting lake are closely inter connected therefore it is essential to systematically understand the hydromorphological processes occurring under the influence of various potential factors especially the impacts of the tgd such knowledge will be conducive to estimating the potential hydromorphological alteration of other large rivers of the world that are or will be affected by large dams here the major purposes of this study are to 1 examine variations in the water and ssd of dongting lake from 1951 to 2014 2 identify decadal morphodynamic changes in the lake 3 and diagnose the possible driving factors of hydromorphological processes 2 material and methods 2 1 study area dongting lake 28 30 30 20 n 111 40 113 10 e which is composed of three subbasins namely the eastern western and southern dongting lakes is located at the confluence of the changjiang yuan li zi and xiang rivers fig 1 thus the lake responds to flood pulses of both the changjiang and basin wide tributary rivers the changjiang river annually supplies 89 5 109 m3 of water and 111 4 106 t of sediment to the eastern dongting lake edl and western dongting lake wdl through the three inlets namely the songzi river hudu river and ouchi river the southern dongting lake sdl and western dongting lake wdl are fed by basin tributaries with an annual average water discharge of 166 7 109 m3 and an annual average ssd of 26 3 106 t including the xiang river zi river yuan river and li river which are referred to as the four waters dongting lake discharges water and sediment into the changjiang river via chenglingji the only outlet from the lake to the river the lake basin is affected by a subtropical monsoon with precipitation concentrated from april june wang et al 2011 seasonal rainfall leads to observable seasonal hydrological characteristics at dongting lake 2 2 data sources the data included in this study comprises five groups the first group includes mean daily water discharge and ssd data collected from 1951 to 2014 at the following eleven gauging stations xinjiangkou shadaoguan mituosi kangjiagang guanjiapu xiangtan taojiang taoyuan shimen chenglingji and nanzui available for 2007 2013 fig 1 water discharge was calculated as the product of measured flow velocity measured by current meter and the cross section area ssd was calculated as the product of water discharge and measured suspended sediment concentrations which were measured at the surface at depths of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 m and near the bottom dai et al 2014 both the runoff and suspended sediment measurements were collected from the changjiang water resources commission cwrc and were strictly examined following national standards in addition daily water discharge and water level data in the years of 2002 and 2014 at shashi and jianli in the middle changjiang river were obtained from the cwrc the second group includes variations in deposition and erosion at dongting lake which were calculated based on topographic maps from 1995 2003 and 2011 at a scales of 1 10000 from the cwrc and zhu et al 2014 the topographic maps were first digitized using arcgis and then gridded into a resolution of 30 30 m using the kriging method the third group includes the thalweg elevation oct 2002 and oct 2013 data obtained along the yichang chenglingji reach and the cross section morphology assessed at seven locations in the changjiang river and dongting lake basin fig 1 the river thalweg and cross section surveys strictly followed national industry standards cross section measurements were perpendicular to the mainstream direction the section survey included land and underwater areas the land measurement extended to 1 m above the highest historical flood level for the underwater survey the interval of measuring points was controlled within 5 m to ensure that feature points were included the section survey was processed using an echo sounder and gps rtk the thalweg elevation was obtained according to the distance between adjacent cross sections and the maximum water depth point in the cross section the cwrc organized the section survey and data compilation the fourth group includes yearly precipitation data obtained from 21 meteorological stations across the dongting lake basin from 1951 to 2014 fig 1 which were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system available at http data cma cn the fifth group includes flow velocity data from 2007 to 2013 at the chenglingji and nanzui stations which were measured by adcp and obtained from the cwrc before these data were published they underwent a rigorous verification and uncertainty analysis the specific data quality control method can be found in previous studies dai and liu 2013 dai et al 2014 based on the collected data monthly yearly water discharge and ssd values thalweg elevation differences and seasonal ssd changes can be calculated the deposition erosion rates of dongting lake were computed from digital topographic maps of different years while the down cutting erosion rates of each cross section were calculated based on the observed cross profile differences during various years the sum of water discharge through the xinjiangkou shadaoguan mituosi kangjiagang and guanjiapu stations represented the contribution of the three inlets while the sum of water discharge through the xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and shimen stations represented the contribution of the four waters the contributions of ssd from the three inlets and four waters were defined in the same manner then the water ssd that flowed into dongting lake was calculated as the total contribution of the three inlets and four waters while the hydrological data at the chenglingji station represented the outflow from the lake to the changjiang river thereafter the sediment budget of dongting lake was defined as the difference in the ssd between the inflow and outflow ssdthree inlets ssdfour waters ssdchenglingji in addition the ratio of the water sediment from the three inlets to the total input ssd threeinlets ssd threeinlets ssd fourwaters 100 was defined as the water sediment percentage of the three inlets similarly the water sediment percentage of the four waters was defined as ssd fourwaters ssd threeinlets ssd fourwaters 100 2 3 data analysis the dongting lake system has experienced the impacts of a series of hydraulic engineering projects including the lower jingjiang cutoff project gd regulation and tgd regulation from 1951 to 2014 to identify the influence of various anthropogenic activities on the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake the entire time series 1951 2014 was divided into four subperiods based on the construction of the lower jingjiang cutoff project from 1967 to 1972 the establishment of the gd in jan 1981 and the tgd in jun 2003 namely the periods from 1951 to 1966 1967 to 1980 1981 to 2003 and 2004 to 2014 subsequently two methods including linear regression and the mann kendall mk test were carried out to diagnose the temporal variation trends of water discharge and ssd mann 1945 kendall 1970 meanwhile box plots were applied to detect the stepwise characteristics of water discharge and ssd over the subperiods tukey 1977 mcgill et al 1978 which involve the minimum q1 the median of the lower half of the sample q2 median q3 the median of the upper half of the sample and maximum values of the data series to discern the seasonal fluctuations in water discharge and ssd during different periods a series of parameters including the coefficient of variation cv and the water ssd ratios of flood seasons from may to october to dry seasons ra were applied in this study values of cv were calculated using the moment method greenwood et al 1979 ra was obtained directly from the monthly data normally higher values of these parameters indicate obvious seasonal discrepancies 3 results 3 1 variations in water and suspended sediment discharge both the total input and output of dongting lake in terms of its annual water discharge and ssd decreased significantly between 1951 and 2014 according to the results of the mk test fig 2 a and b meanwhile distinct stepwise decreases were observed in the average annual input and output of water discharge and ssd over the four periods fig 2a and b taking the average annual water discharge and ssd from 1951 to 1966 as reference levels the average annual water discharge of the three inlets decreased by 38 54 and 67 from 1967 to 1980 1981 2003 and 2004 2014 respectively meanwhile the average annual ssd at the three inlets decreased by 41 60 and 96 over the latter three periods fig 2c and d similar stepwise declining trends were observed in the ssd of the four waters after 1966 while its water discharge showed little change fig 2c and d for the total inflow outflow and three inlets the statistical parameters of the maximum q3 and median values in the box whisker plots showed obvious stepwise decreases during the four periods fig 3 in general the magnitude of the decrease in ssd was more remarkable than that in water discharge fig 3 it must be emphasized that the ssd output from the lake to the changjiang river increased markedly after 2007 fig 2b which will be further discussed in the next section in addition obvious seasonal fluctuations in water discharge and ssd were observed during the study period fig 4 over 60 of the annual water discharge was transported during the flood season at the three inlets four waters and chenglingji for the contribution of sediment load during the flood season the three inlets and four waters exhibited a high value of 80 over the past several decades water discharge during flood seasons and dry seasons also presented distinct stepwise declines fig 4a and ssd showed an even more dramatic decrease than water discharge fig 4b at the three inlets for example water discharge during the flood seasons and dry seasons from 2004 to 2014 decreased by approximately 66 and 84 respectively compared to 1951 1966 while its ssd decreased by 95 and nearly 100 respectively fig 4b1 the declining ra revealed a reduced distinction between flood seasons and dry seasons table 1 thus dongting lake seems to show a tendency towards less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season 3 2 rating curves between water and suspended sediment discharge the rating curves between monthly water discharge and ssd presented positive linear correlations at all sites fig 5 however the slopes of fitting curves decreased significantly during the given four stages notably the most significant slope decrease was observed at the three inlets decreasing from 1 85 in 1951 1966 to 0 29 in 2004 2014 fig 5a1 a4 indicating that the descent rate of ssd was much greater than that of water discharge especially from 2004 to 2014 fig 3 the patterns of the sediment rating curves of different sites also varied during different time stages fig 5 during 1951 2003 the ssd at the three inlets was greater during the rising stage of the rating curve than that during the falling stage at the same flow conditions the peak water discharge and sediment load values presumably occurred in july however the rating curve shifted counterclockwise from 2004 to 2014 fig 5a5 with a smaller ssd during the rising stage for the same water discharge when the maximum water discharge and ssd values appeared in july therefore it could be speculated that the sediment sources changed under the impacts of climate change human activities or both the rating curve pattern of the four waters remained counterclockwise during the four stages with the sediment peak occurring during june the rainy season when most storms occur fig 5b5 the rating curve at chenglingji showed a clockwise hysteresis loop over the past few decades with the water discharge peak during either june or july while the sediment peaked occurring during april or may fig 5c5 3 3 sediment budget and sedimentary processes of dongting lake the monthly sediment distribution at dongting lake showed that the sediment load was mainly transported during the flood season when over 99 82 and 59 of the annual sediment transport occurred at the three inlets four waters and chenglingji respectively fig 6 a c both the input and output ssd of dongting lake decreased sharply from 1951 to 2014 especially in flood seasons generally the sediment budget of dongting lake decreased concurrently with that of the three inlets fig 6d specifically compared to 1951 1966 the average annual sediment budget at dongting lake subsequently decreased 35 from 1967 to 1980 by 34 from 1981 to 2003 and by 103 from 2004 to 2014 fig 6d table 2 during the flood seasons and dry seasons the sediment budget decreased by approximately 3 57 and 48 65 respectively compared to those of 1951 1966 table 2 notably the average annual sediment budget was negative from 2004 to 2014 indicating that dongting lake experienced erosion and provided sediment to the changjiang river it should be mentioned that the sediment budget of dongting lake could be overestimated due to a lack of data regarding sand mining which requires further study variations in the sediment budget can have a great impact on the sedimentation of dongting lake the erosion deposition pattern of dongting lake clearly changed from 1995 to 2011 fig 7 a1 specifically sediment in dongting lake was deposited continuously at a deposition rate of 0 41 cm yr from 1995 to 2003 with the main deposition areas located in the northern part of the edl the eastern part of the sdl and the western part of the wdl however sedimentation in dongting lake transformed from deposition to erosion between 2003 and 2011 with a mean erosion rate of 1 21 cm yr fig 7a2 zhu et al 2014 furthermore the edl exhibited the most significant change in the erosion deposition pattern followed by the sdl while the wdl exhibited the most insignificant variation fig 7a the morphological evolution of the delta within dongting lake was consistent with the sediment budget and erosion deposition pattern variations of the lake for instance the ouchi and xiangjiang deltas which are located at the edl and sdl respectively received replenishment from the ouchi and xiang rivers and were both threatened by deltaic erosion due to insufficient sediment supply fig 7b the total area of the ouchi delta declined significantly after 2003 with erosion mainly occurring in the middle zone further fragmenting the delta at its tail part fig 7b similarly the total area of the xiangjiang delta showed notable degradation after 2003 with the delta gradually breaking into multiple delta fragments fig 7b 4 discussion the long term hydrological variations and morphological processes of the dongting lake basin and the changjiang river are closely related to climate changes and anthropogenic activities dai et al 2005 yuan et al 2015 here the possible impact factors on the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake are discussed 4 1 precipitation in the dongting lake basin dongting lake is located in the east asia summer monsoon region water discharge over the lake basin is dominated by precipitation which could be supported by the good correlation between basin precipitation and the water discharge of the four waters fig 8 a zhang et al 2007 zhao et al 2017 because no significant trend was observed in basin precipitation from 1951 to 2014 the water discharge of the dongting lake basin four waters showed an insignificant trend during the same period fig 2c fig 3 and fig 8b however the ssd of dongting lake showed significant stepwise decreasing trends from 1951 to 2014 fig 3 the different trends between basin precipitation and sediment load suggest that precipitation had little impact on the observed changes in sediment 4 2 anthropogenic activities in the dongting lake basin because it is obvious that the ssd variations in the dongting lake basin were not induced by precipitation other potential factors likely caused the observed variations such as human activities including reservoir regulation and land use changes du et al 2011 4 2 1 reservoir construction in the dongting lake basin according to previous studies large amounts of sediment can be trapped in reservoirs without being diverted yang et al 2007 dai et al 2014 gao et al 2015 in the dongting lake basin 14 121 reservoirs have been constructed with a total storage capacity of 53 109 m3 including 47 large scale reservoirs 108 m3 and 372 medium scale reservoirs 107 108 m3 as of 2012 china census for water in hunan province 2013 the total capacity of large scale reservoirs increased from 6 109 m3 in 1951 1966 to 9 109 m3 28 109 m3 and 36 109 m3 in 1967 1980 1981 2003 and 2004 2014 respectively fig 9 approximately 0 12 of this reservoir storage capacity was lost due to sediment deposition in the dongting lake basin sun and fang 2002 given that the bulk density of sediment is 1 2 t m3 dai and liu 2013 these reservoirs could have trapped 9 106 t yr 13 106 t yr 40 106 t yr and 52 106 t yr of sediment during these four periods respectively the ssd at the four waters increased slightly during the first two periods then decreased significantly especially during 1981 2003 and 2003 2013 fig 2d the drastic reduction in ssd in from 1981 to 2014 was mainly caused by sediment retention in reservoirs when the total reservoir storage capacity was 3 4 times larger than that from 1951 to 1980 4 2 2 land use changes in the dongting lake basin in addition land use changes in the dongting lake basin can also influence surface runoff water yield and sediment discharge at the four waters sun et al 2017 due to a widely distributed granitic weathered zone soil erosion is common in the dongting lake basin chen et al 2004 from 1951 to the 1970s serious deforestation and unreasonable land use resulted in severe soil erosion and caused 0 2 billion tons of soil loss in the lake basin zou 1992 therefore the principle factor causing the increasing ssd from 1967 to 1980 was serious soil erosion in the dongting lake basin following the severe and destructive flood of 1998 a program named return land to lake was implemented which controlled the loss of soil erosion to some extent further decreasing the ssd over the period of 1981 2003 peng et al 2005 after the construction of the tgd along with prolonged droughts in dongting lake some cultivated land and woodland were gradually developed jiang et al 2016 such variations may have changed the water infiltration and soil erosion within dongting lake which could have indirectly affected the hydrological processes of the lake zhang et al 2013 deng et al 2014 moreover the sdl receives flow directly from the four waters thus changes in water discharge and ssd have observable effects on the morphological evolution of the sdl fig 7 under the impacts of precipitation reservoir construction and land use changes water discharge showed insignificant trends while ssd decreased significantly at the four waters during the different periods it can be concluded that the fragmentation of the xiangjiang delta can likely be attributed to the hungry water produced by the non synchronous changes between the water and the ssd 4 3 projects along the changjiang river dongting lake is directly connected to the changjiang river by the three inlets input of the lake and chenglingji output of the lake with more than 30 of the water and 70 of the sediment of dongting lake contributed by the three inlets fig 10 unlike the water discharge variations at the four waters both water discharge and ssd presented similar decreasing trends at the three inlets thus the changes in water discharge and ssd at the three inlets were mainly controlled by intensive anthropogenic activities from the changjiang river basin here based on the hydraulic engineering construction projects implemented during different periods we analyzed the impacts of the lower jingjiang cutoff project and the gd and tgd impoundments on dongting lake 4 3 1 the cutoff project in the lower jingjiang reach a series of changes occurred in the lower jingjiang reach after the cutoff project including a river length shortening of 80 6 km a decrease in sinuosity from 2 83 to 1 93 and a hydraulic gradient increase fig 1 yin et al 2007 the evolution of the lower jingjiang reach slowed until the channel in the reach achieved a new balance in 1980 tang 1999 thus the effects of the jingjiang reach cutoff project were concentrated from 1967 to 1980 the ratio of the water sediment diversion at the three inlets apparently decreased from 1967 to 1980 suggesting that much less water and sediment could enter dongting lake through the three inlets fan et al 2008 hu et al 2015 meanwhile dry days at the three inlets increased considerably such as at guanjiapu along the ouchi river where they increased from 17 days yr from 1951 to 1966 to 117 days yr deng et al 2012 consequently water discharge at three inlets decreased much more remarkably than it did during the other periods due to the jingjiang cutoff project figs 3 and 10 water discharge at the three inlets decreased remarkably due to the impact of the jingjiang cutoff project thereby affecting the sediment transport the ssd of the three inlets dropped by 41 from 210 106 t in 1951 1966 to 124 106 t in 1967 1980 with the ssd during the flood season reduced by nearly 50 fig 4b and fig 6a as the most important source of sediment for dongting lake the percentage of ssd from the three inlets was 86 from 1951 to 1966 but it declined remarkably to 77 from 1967 to 1980 after the construction of the cutoff project in the lower jingjiang reach fig 10 the decrease in ssd and ssd percentage at the three inlets indicated that the cutoff project played an important role in the sediment changes at dongting lake 4 3 2 the regulation of the gd and tgd by 2013 more than 50 000 dams had been constructed along the changjiang river which caused a dramatic decrease in fluvial sediment and led to substantial geomorphologic changes yang et al 2005 dai and liu 2013 both water and ssd at the three inlets have presented declining trends since the impoundment of the gd in jan 1981 in addition the decrease in water percentage at the three inlets suggested that the gd had more of an influence on water discharge than it did on ssd fig 2dand fig 10 the tgd the largest dam in the world has a storage capacity of 39 3 109 m3 which is nearly 25 times that of the gd notably the ssd and ssd percentage of the three inlets decreased most significantly during the period of 2004 2014 figs 2 and 10 the ssd dropped from 87 106 t yr from 1981 to 2003 to 9 106 t yr from 2004 to 2014 while the ssd percentage at the three inlets decreased from 78 to 52 almost equal to that of the four waters fig 10 the significant decline in sediment at the three inlets can be directly attributed to the high sediment retention 139 106 t yr of the tgd after 2003 changjiang sediment bulletin 2013 in contrast to the change in ssd at the three inlets the water discharge demonstrated a stable decreasing trend from 2004 to 2014 indicating that the effect of the tgd operation on water discharge was relatively small fig 2c and fig 10 with most sediment being trapped in reservoirs hungry water is prone to erode channel beds and banks to achieve a new equilibrium kondolf 1997 the reach downstream of the tgd namely the yichang chenglingji reach was severely affected with an average thalweg down cutting of 2 m and a total channel erosion volume of 841 106 m3 from october 2002 to october 2013 changjiang sediment bulletin 2007 2013 fig 11 a meanwhile the sites on the mainstream changjiang river showed a trend of down cutting to different extents fig 11c specifically the cross sections of d5 j90 and j186 exhibited serious down cutting with an erosion rates of 0 14 m yr 0 05 m yr and 0 4 m yr respectively in contrast the cross sections of most sites in the dongting lake basin remained unchanged except for xinjiangkou which experienced an erosion rate of 0 1 m yr fig 11d1 moreover the daily mean water level at shashi and jianli in the jingjiang reach decreased by 0 56 m and 0 10 m respectively between 2002 and 2014 under the same water discharge conditions the water level in 2014 was far below that of the pre tgd period this phenomenon can be better observed at shashi fig 11b channel degradation with a declining water surface along the changjiang river further enlarged the topography gradient between the river and the inlets outlets of dongting lake which played a key role in the reduction of water discharge and facilitated the further reduction of the sediment load entering the three inlets from 2004 to 2014 the enlarged topographic gradient between dongting lake and the changjiang river changed the hydrodynamic conditions within dongting lake the mean and peak flow velocity of the dongting lake outlet chenglingji station presented increasing trends from 2007 to 2013 both at high 29 39 m in jun and low water levels 20 84 m in dec jan fig 12 a the rising flow velocities indicated that dongting lake would provide more water and sediment to the changjiang river even during the dry season indeed the ssd of chenglingji presented a significant increasing trend after 2007 furthermore the sediment budget of dongting lake changed from a gain of approximately 120 106 t yr from 1951 to 2003 to a loss of 2 106 t yr from 2004 to 2014 showing that the changjiang river provided sediment to dongting lake before 2003 but extracted sediment from the lake thereafter fig 2b and fig 6 along with the reduction in the sediment source and increase in the outlet flow velocity dongting lake transformed from experiencing deposition to erosion after 2003 which can be confirmed by the shrinking of the ouchi delta in the western part of the edl fig 7 moreover the water dispatch modes of the tgd altered the water regime in the changjiang river downstream from the tgd wang et al 2013 the cross section at nanzui the main entrance of the three inlets to the wdl underwent a slight change from 2007 to 2013 while the flow velocity showed a statistically significant decreasing trend at high water levels 32 26 m in jun jul aug and an increasing trend at low water levels 28 13 m in dec jan feb fig 12b specifically during the high water season the tgd needed to store water for flood control as well as for the water supply in the winter resulting in a decrease in the water sediment load and water velocity into dongting lake through the nanzui station ou et al 2012 wang et al 2013 in contrast during the low water season the tgd released water to satisfy the downstream water demand causing increases in the water and water velocity at the nanzui station fig 12b an increased sediment load at a low water level could partly mitigate the decreased sediment load at a high water level which made the sediment budget of the wdl change slightly and thus resulted in an insignificant change in the erosion deposition pattern fig 7a however the water replenishment during winter can hardly reverse the declining trends during the entire dry season at dongting lake because less water could flow into dongting lake through the three inlets due to the serious erosion of the channel of the changjiang river and more water was delivered to the changjiang river although the dongting lake basin is still likely threatened by flood events in the case of extreme precipitation the tendency of less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season at dongting lake is predictable under the impacts of the tgd 5 conclusions the water regime of lakes worldwide has changed drastically under the combined impacts of global climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities this study focuses on the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake and their impact factors the major findings are as follows 1 the yearly water discharge ssd of dongting lake showed obvious stepwise decreasing trends except for the water discharge at the four waters even though there were seasonal fluctuations in water discharge and ssd from 1951 to 2014 meanwhile the hydrological behavior of dongting exhibited a tendency towards less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season the rating curves of the four waters and chenglingji remained unchanged from 1951 to 2014 while the rating curve of the three inlets shifted from clockwise to counterclockwise from 2004 to 2014 2 the deposition erosion pattern of dongting lake transformed from deposition from 1951 to 2003 to erosion from 2004 to 2014 which was accompanied by a marked drop in the sediment budget of dongting lake and the shrinking of the xiangjiang and ouchi deltas 3 the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake were closely related to climate change and anthropogenic activities for the four waters basin precipitation dominated the water discharge while severe soil erosion and reservoir retention induced an increasing ssd during 1967 1980 and a decreasing ssd during 1981 2014 respectively the hydrological variations at the three inlets were mainly controlled by intensive anthropogenic activities in the changjiang river basin where the jingjiang cutoff project gd and tgd were the main drivers for the decreases in the water and sediment load from 1967 to 1980 1981 to 2003 and 2004 to 2014 respectively the high sediment retention 139 106 t yr behind the tgd directly led to drastic reduction in the sediment input from changjiang to the three inlets the observable increased ssd output from the lake to changjiang after 2007 was caused by tgd induced riverbed incision thus the tgd was responsible for the transformation of the deposition erosion pattern at dongting lake identifying these hydromorphological processes and their associated driving factors is useful for lake management and the regulation of human activity our study reveals that anthropogenic activities have gradually become the principle factors of hydromorphological variations at dongting lake large dams constructed in mainstreams regions have complicated the downstream mechanisms to maintain the relationship between the lake and rivers and prolong the life of the lake more systematic research should be conducted acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc 41576087 41571100 41706093

7220,under the impact of intensive anthropogenic activities and in the context of global climate change the hydromorphological processes of most lakes around the world have changed dramatically here based on hydrologic and topographic data we analyzed secular variations in hydromorphological characteristics and their influencing factors at dongting lake the second largest freshwater lake in china the entire time series 1951 2014 was divided into four subperiods based on the anthropogenic modifications of the changjiang yangtze river including the construction of the lower jingjiang cutoff project and the operation of the gezhou dam gd and the three gorges dam tgd the results indicated that there were obvious stepwise decreasing trends in the annual water discharge and suspended sediment discharge ssd from 1951 to 2014 seasonal differences in water discharge and ssd over the recent 60 years exhibited a tendency of less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season meanwhile the deposition erosion budget of dongting lake shifted from a deposition rate of 120 106 t yr from 1951 to 2003 to an erosion rate of 2 106 t yr with the serious degradation of the ouchi and xiangjiang deltas after 2003 the hydrological processes of dongting lake are dominated by different anthropogenic activities at different stages the jingjiang cutoff project is the main driver of the decreases in water discharge and ssd from 1967 to 1980 the operation of the gd along the changjiang river and other reservoirs as well as land use changes in the dongting lake basin should be responsible for the hydrological variations from 1981 to 2003 the high sediment retention rate geometric adjustment of the channel and flow regulation induced by the operation of the tgd are the main drivers for the hydromorphological variations in dongting lake in 2004 2014 keywords hydromorphological processes water and sediment budgets anthropogenic activities dongting lake changjiang yangtze river 1 introduction there are 250 lakes with a surface area of more than 500 km2 around the world and they occupy only a tiny part of earth s total land herdendorf 1982 lehner and d√∂ll 2004 nonetheless all of these lakes play an important role in maintaining regional and global ecosystem diversity as well as providing basic survival conditions for humans such as the water supply economic resources and even flood control kummu et al 2011 however most large lakes around the world are undergoing expansion or shrinking processes under the context of global climate change and anthropogenic activities examples include the majority of lakes in tibet twelve mile lake in the usa lake chad in africa and lake urmia in iran bianduo et al 2009 lemoalle et al 2012 jepsen et al 2013 alizadeh choobari et al 2016 dongting lake which is the second largest freshwater lake in china with an area of 2623 km2 and a volume of 16 7 109 m3 joins the middle changjiang yangtze river from the south the lake directly gets 75 of its sediment and 34 of its water from the changjiang river and is of vital significance for buffering flooding along the middle lower changjiang river nakayama and watanabe 2008 wang et al 2011 located in a vast floodplain dongting lake feeds a population of millions zhou et al 2016 and the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake therefore directly reflect the history of human anthropogenic activities following the principle of taking steel as the key link taking grain as the key link over one third of lakes in the changjiang river basin were reclaimed to plow land accompanied by serious deforestation and soil erosion during the 1950s 1970s and dongting lake is no exception indicating that it has experienced dramatic deposition yin and li 2001 xiang et al 2003 meanwhile the lower jingjiang ouchikou chenglingji cutoff project was implemented from 1967 to 1972 to improve the flood control capacity and navigation conditions of the changjiang river the shortened river length and decreasing sinuosity in the jingjiang reach have altered the relationship between the changjiang river and dongting lake yin et al 2007 subsequently a large number of dams were constructed in the changjiang river basin and dongting lake system after the 1980s including the most obvious examples of the gezhou dam gd and the three gorges dam tgd the gd which is located in yichang at the beginning of the middle changjiang river was operated in january 1981 with a storage capacity of 15 8 108 m3 following the operation of the gd heavy siltation was detected in the region upstream of the dam site while the riverbed below the dam experienced erosion chen et al 2007 the heavy sediment trapping of the dam and further riverbed scouring after the implementation of the lower jingjiang cutoff project both decreased the sediment load from the changjiang river to dongting lake yin et al 2007 notwithstanding the significant decreases in inflow water and sediment following those previous anthropogenic modifications after the 1970s dongting lake still maintained its deposition pattern yin et al 2007 the history of deposition in dongting lake however was completely changed after the operation of the tgd the tgd which is currently the world s largest dam and is located along the upper reaches of the changjiang river has been in operation since 2003 and has had significant impacts on the hydrological regime in the middle and lower reaches dai and liu 2013 mei et al 2015 2018 li et al 2016 with a large amount of sediment trapped in the reservoir the ssd from the changjiang river into the east china sea has dropped from 423 106 t yr to less than 135 106 t yr the downstream riverbed has transformed from experiencing seasonal erosion to year round erosion and the sediment carrying capacity below the dam has been greatly reduced dai et al 2016 lai et al 2017 the alteration of river discharge and sediment transport in the changjiang river resulted in the adjustment of dongting lake dai and liu 2013 therefore there are increasing concerns regarding the impact of the tgd on the hydrological processes of dongting lake some research has indicated that the construction of the tgd was the dominant factor in the prolonged duration of low water levels and the declined inundation area of dongting lake lai et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 deng et al 2012 showed that the replenishment ability of the changjiang river in extreme drought years was higher than normal despite decreasing flow and sediment diversion at the three inlets i e the entrance of the changjiang river meanwhile recent studies have argued that dongting lake changed from exhibiting high siltation to erosion due to a tgd induced decrease in the fluvial sediment supply yin et al 2007 zhu et al 2014 which can significantly affect the lacustrine delta system xia et al 2017 indicated that the channel variation in the jingjiang reach of the changjiang river tended to be influential in the discharge and flood discharge capacity of the lake because they represent a complicated hydrographic net when referring to hydromorphological alteration the impacts of the main tributaries of the lake should not be neglected furthermore the alteration of the hydrology and geomorphology of dongting lake are closely inter connected therefore it is essential to systematically understand the hydromorphological processes occurring under the influence of various potential factors especially the impacts of the tgd such knowledge will be conducive to estimating the potential hydromorphological alteration of other large rivers of the world that are or will be affected by large dams here the major purposes of this study are to 1 examine variations in the water and ssd of dongting lake from 1951 to 2014 2 identify decadal morphodynamic changes in the lake 3 and diagnose the possible driving factors of hydromorphological processes 2 material and methods 2 1 study area dongting lake 28 30 30 20 n 111 40 113 10 e which is composed of three subbasins namely the eastern western and southern dongting lakes is located at the confluence of the changjiang yuan li zi and xiang rivers fig 1 thus the lake responds to flood pulses of both the changjiang and basin wide tributary rivers the changjiang river annually supplies 89 5 109 m3 of water and 111 4 106 t of sediment to the eastern dongting lake edl and western dongting lake wdl through the three inlets namely the songzi river hudu river and ouchi river the southern dongting lake sdl and western dongting lake wdl are fed by basin tributaries with an annual average water discharge of 166 7 109 m3 and an annual average ssd of 26 3 106 t including the xiang river zi river yuan river and li river which are referred to as the four waters dongting lake discharges water and sediment into the changjiang river via chenglingji the only outlet from the lake to the river the lake basin is affected by a subtropical monsoon with precipitation concentrated from april june wang et al 2011 seasonal rainfall leads to observable seasonal hydrological characteristics at dongting lake 2 2 data sources the data included in this study comprises five groups the first group includes mean daily water discharge and ssd data collected from 1951 to 2014 at the following eleven gauging stations xinjiangkou shadaoguan mituosi kangjiagang guanjiapu xiangtan taojiang taoyuan shimen chenglingji and nanzui available for 2007 2013 fig 1 water discharge was calculated as the product of measured flow velocity measured by current meter and the cross section area ssd was calculated as the product of water discharge and measured suspended sediment concentrations which were measured at the surface at depths of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 m and near the bottom dai et al 2014 both the runoff and suspended sediment measurements were collected from the changjiang water resources commission cwrc and were strictly examined following national standards in addition daily water discharge and water level data in the years of 2002 and 2014 at shashi and jianli in the middle changjiang river were obtained from the cwrc the second group includes variations in deposition and erosion at dongting lake which were calculated based on topographic maps from 1995 2003 and 2011 at a scales of 1 10000 from the cwrc and zhu et al 2014 the topographic maps were first digitized using arcgis and then gridded into a resolution of 30 30 m using the kriging method the third group includes the thalweg elevation oct 2002 and oct 2013 data obtained along the yichang chenglingji reach and the cross section morphology assessed at seven locations in the changjiang river and dongting lake basin fig 1 the river thalweg and cross section surveys strictly followed national industry standards cross section measurements were perpendicular to the mainstream direction the section survey included land and underwater areas the land measurement extended to 1 m above the highest historical flood level for the underwater survey the interval of measuring points was controlled within 5 m to ensure that feature points were included the section survey was processed using an echo sounder and gps rtk the thalweg elevation was obtained according to the distance between adjacent cross sections and the maximum water depth point in the cross section the cwrc organized the section survey and data compilation the fourth group includes yearly precipitation data obtained from 21 meteorological stations across the dongting lake basin from 1951 to 2014 fig 1 which were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system available at http data cma cn the fifth group includes flow velocity data from 2007 to 2013 at the chenglingji and nanzui stations which were measured by adcp and obtained from the cwrc before these data were published they underwent a rigorous verification and uncertainty analysis the specific data quality control method can be found in previous studies dai and liu 2013 dai et al 2014 based on the collected data monthly yearly water discharge and ssd values thalweg elevation differences and seasonal ssd changes can be calculated the deposition erosion rates of dongting lake were computed from digital topographic maps of different years while the down cutting erosion rates of each cross section were calculated based on the observed cross profile differences during various years the sum of water discharge through the xinjiangkou shadaoguan mituosi kangjiagang and guanjiapu stations represented the contribution of the three inlets while the sum of water discharge through the xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and shimen stations represented the contribution of the four waters the contributions of ssd from the three inlets and four waters were defined in the same manner then the water ssd that flowed into dongting lake was calculated as the total contribution of the three inlets and four waters while the hydrological data at the chenglingji station represented the outflow from the lake to the changjiang river thereafter the sediment budget of dongting lake was defined as the difference in the ssd between the inflow and outflow ssdthree inlets ssdfour waters ssdchenglingji in addition the ratio of the water sediment from the three inlets to the total input ssd threeinlets ssd threeinlets ssd fourwaters 100 was defined as the water sediment percentage of the three inlets similarly the water sediment percentage of the four waters was defined as ssd fourwaters ssd threeinlets ssd fourwaters 100 2 3 data analysis the dongting lake system has experienced the impacts of a series of hydraulic engineering projects including the lower jingjiang cutoff project gd regulation and tgd regulation from 1951 to 2014 to identify the influence of various anthropogenic activities on the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake the entire time series 1951 2014 was divided into four subperiods based on the construction of the lower jingjiang cutoff project from 1967 to 1972 the establishment of the gd in jan 1981 and the tgd in jun 2003 namely the periods from 1951 to 1966 1967 to 1980 1981 to 2003 and 2004 to 2014 subsequently two methods including linear regression and the mann kendall mk test were carried out to diagnose the temporal variation trends of water discharge and ssd mann 1945 kendall 1970 meanwhile box plots were applied to detect the stepwise characteristics of water discharge and ssd over the subperiods tukey 1977 mcgill et al 1978 which involve the minimum q1 the median of the lower half of the sample q2 median q3 the median of the upper half of the sample and maximum values of the data series to discern the seasonal fluctuations in water discharge and ssd during different periods a series of parameters including the coefficient of variation cv and the water ssd ratios of flood seasons from may to october to dry seasons ra were applied in this study values of cv were calculated using the moment method greenwood et al 1979 ra was obtained directly from the monthly data normally higher values of these parameters indicate obvious seasonal discrepancies 3 results 3 1 variations in water and suspended sediment discharge both the total input and output of dongting lake in terms of its annual water discharge and ssd decreased significantly between 1951 and 2014 according to the results of the mk test fig 2 a and b meanwhile distinct stepwise decreases were observed in the average annual input and output of water discharge and ssd over the four periods fig 2a and b taking the average annual water discharge and ssd from 1951 to 1966 as reference levels the average annual water discharge of the three inlets decreased by 38 54 and 67 from 1967 to 1980 1981 2003 and 2004 2014 respectively meanwhile the average annual ssd at the three inlets decreased by 41 60 and 96 over the latter three periods fig 2c and d similar stepwise declining trends were observed in the ssd of the four waters after 1966 while its water discharge showed little change fig 2c and d for the total inflow outflow and three inlets the statistical parameters of the maximum q3 and median values in the box whisker plots showed obvious stepwise decreases during the four periods fig 3 in general the magnitude of the decrease in ssd was more remarkable than that in water discharge fig 3 it must be emphasized that the ssd output from the lake to the changjiang river increased markedly after 2007 fig 2b which will be further discussed in the next section in addition obvious seasonal fluctuations in water discharge and ssd were observed during the study period fig 4 over 60 of the annual water discharge was transported during the flood season at the three inlets four waters and chenglingji for the contribution of sediment load during the flood season the three inlets and four waters exhibited a high value of 80 over the past several decades water discharge during flood seasons and dry seasons also presented distinct stepwise declines fig 4a and ssd showed an even more dramatic decrease than water discharge fig 4b at the three inlets for example water discharge during the flood seasons and dry seasons from 2004 to 2014 decreased by approximately 66 and 84 respectively compared to 1951 1966 while its ssd decreased by 95 and nearly 100 respectively fig 4b1 the declining ra revealed a reduced distinction between flood seasons and dry seasons table 1 thus dongting lake seems to show a tendency towards less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season 3 2 rating curves between water and suspended sediment discharge the rating curves between monthly water discharge and ssd presented positive linear correlations at all sites fig 5 however the slopes of fitting curves decreased significantly during the given four stages notably the most significant slope decrease was observed at the three inlets decreasing from 1 85 in 1951 1966 to 0 29 in 2004 2014 fig 5a1 a4 indicating that the descent rate of ssd was much greater than that of water discharge especially from 2004 to 2014 fig 3 the patterns of the sediment rating curves of different sites also varied during different time stages fig 5 during 1951 2003 the ssd at the three inlets was greater during the rising stage of the rating curve than that during the falling stage at the same flow conditions the peak water discharge and sediment load values presumably occurred in july however the rating curve shifted counterclockwise from 2004 to 2014 fig 5a5 with a smaller ssd during the rising stage for the same water discharge when the maximum water discharge and ssd values appeared in july therefore it could be speculated that the sediment sources changed under the impacts of climate change human activities or both the rating curve pattern of the four waters remained counterclockwise during the four stages with the sediment peak occurring during june the rainy season when most storms occur fig 5b5 the rating curve at chenglingji showed a clockwise hysteresis loop over the past few decades with the water discharge peak during either june or july while the sediment peaked occurring during april or may fig 5c5 3 3 sediment budget and sedimentary processes of dongting lake the monthly sediment distribution at dongting lake showed that the sediment load was mainly transported during the flood season when over 99 82 and 59 of the annual sediment transport occurred at the three inlets four waters and chenglingji respectively fig 6 a c both the input and output ssd of dongting lake decreased sharply from 1951 to 2014 especially in flood seasons generally the sediment budget of dongting lake decreased concurrently with that of the three inlets fig 6d specifically compared to 1951 1966 the average annual sediment budget at dongting lake subsequently decreased 35 from 1967 to 1980 by 34 from 1981 to 2003 and by 103 from 2004 to 2014 fig 6d table 2 during the flood seasons and dry seasons the sediment budget decreased by approximately 3 57 and 48 65 respectively compared to those of 1951 1966 table 2 notably the average annual sediment budget was negative from 2004 to 2014 indicating that dongting lake experienced erosion and provided sediment to the changjiang river it should be mentioned that the sediment budget of dongting lake could be overestimated due to a lack of data regarding sand mining which requires further study variations in the sediment budget can have a great impact on the sedimentation of dongting lake the erosion deposition pattern of dongting lake clearly changed from 1995 to 2011 fig 7 a1 specifically sediment in dongting lake was deposited continuously at a deposition rate of 0 41 cm yr from 1995 to 2003 with the main deposition areas located in the northern part of the edl the eastern part of the sdl and the western part of the wdl however sedimentation in dongting lake transformed from deposition to erosion between 2003 and 2011 with a mean erosion rate of 1 21 cm yr fig 7a2 zhu et al 2014 furthermore the edl exhibited the most significant change in the erosion deposition pattern followed by the sdl while the wdl exhibited the most insignificant variation fig 7a the morphological evolution of the delta within dongting lake was consistent with the sediment budget and erosion deposition pattern variations of the lake for instance the ouchi and xiangjiang deltas which are located at the edl and sdl respectively received replenishment from the ouchi and xiang rivers and were both threatened by deltaic erosion due to insufficient sediment supply fig 7b the total area of the ouchi delta declined significantly after 2003 with erosion mainly occurring in the middle zone further fragmenting the delta at its tail part fig 7b similarly the total area of the xiangjiang delta showed notable degradation after 2003 with the delta gradually breaking into multiple delta fragments fig 7b 4 discussion the long term hydrological variations and morphological processes of the dongting lake basin and the changjiang river are closely related to climate changes and anthropogenic activities dai et al 2005 yuan et al 2015 here the possible impact factors on the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake are discussed 4 1 precipitation in the dongting lake basin dongting lake is located in the east asia summer monsoon region water discharge over the lake basin is dominated by precipitation which could be supported by the good correlation between basin precipitation and the water discharge of the four waters fig 8 a zhang et al 2007 zhao et al 2017 because no significant trend was observed in basin precipitation from 1951 to 2014 the water discharge of the dongting lake basin four waters showed an insignificant trend during the same period fig 2c fig 3 and fig 8b however the ssd of dongting lake showed significant stepwise decreasing trends from 1951 to 2014 fig 3 the different trends between basin precipitation and sediment load suggest that precipitation had little impact on the observed changes in sediment 4 2 anthropogenic activities in the dongting lake basin because it is obvious that the ssd variations in the dongting lake basin were not induced by precipitation other potential factors likely caused the observed variations such as human activities including reservoir regulation and land use changes du et al 2011 4 2 1 reservoir construction in the dongting lake basin according to previous studies large amounts of sediment can be trapped in reservoirs without being diverted yang et al 2007 dai et al 2014 gao et al 2015 in the dongting lake basin 14 121 reservoirs have been constructed with a total storage capacity of 53 109 m3 including 47 large scale reservoirs 108 m3 and 372 medium scale reservoirs 107 108 m3 as of 2012 china census for water in hunan province 2013 the total capacity of large scale reservoirs increased from 6 109 m3 in 1951 1966 to 9 109 m3 28 109 m3 and 36 109 m3 in 1967 1980 1981 2003 and 2004 2014 respectively fig 9 approximately 0 12 of this reservoir storage capacity was lost due to sediment deposition in the dongting lake basin sun and fang 2002 given that the bulk density of sediment is 1 2 t m3 dai and liu 2013 these reservoirs could have trapped 9 106 t yr 13 106 t yr 40 106 t yr and 52 106 t yr of sediment during these four periods respectively the ssd at the four waters increased slightly during the first two periods then decreased significantly especially during 1981 2003 and 2003 2013 fig 2d the drastic reduction in ssd in from 1981 to 2014 was mainly caused by sediment retention in reservoirs when the total reservoir storage capacity was 3 4 times larger than that from 1951 to 1980 4 2 2 land use changes in the dongting lake basin in addition land use changes in the dongting lake basin can also influence surface runoff water yield and sediment discharge at the four waters sun et al 2017 due to a widely distributed granitic weathered zone soil erosion is common in the dongting lake basin chen et al 2004 from 1951 to the 1970s serious deforestation and unreasonable land use resulted in severe soil erosion and caused 0 2 billion tons of soil loss in the lake basin zou 1992 therefore the principle factor causing the increasing ssd from 1967 to 1980 was serious soil erosion in the dongting lake basin following the severe and destructive flood of 1998 a program named return land to lake was implemented which controlled the loss of soil erosion to some extent further decreasing the ssd over the period of 1981 2003 peng et al 2005 after the construction of the tgd along with prolonged droughts in dongting lake some cultivated land and woodland were gradually developed jiang et al 2016 such variations may have changed the water infiltration and soil erosion within dongting lake which could have indirectly affected the hydrological processes of the lake zhang et al 2013 deng et al 2014 moreover the sdl receives flow directly from the four waters thus changes in water discharge and ssd have observable effects on the morphological evolution of the sdl fig 7 under the impacts of precipitation reservoir construction and land use changes water discharge showed insignificant trends while ssd decreased significantly at the four waters during the different periods it can be concluded that the fragmentation of the xiangjiang delta can likely be attributed to the hungry water produced by the non synchronous changes between the water and the ssd 4 3 projects along the changjiang river dongting lake is directly connected to the changjiang river by the three inlets input of the lake and chenglingji output of the lake with more than 30 of the water and 70 of the sediment of dongting lake contributed by the three inlets fig 10 unlike the water discharge variations at the four waters both water discharge and ssd presented similar decreasing trends at the three inlets thus the changes in water discharge and ssd at the three inlets were mainly controlled by intensive anthropogenic activities from the changjiang river basin here based on the hydraulic engineering construction projects implemented during different periods we analyzed the impacts of the lower jingjiang cutoff project and the gd and tgd impoundments on dongting lake 4 3 1 the cutoff project in the lower jingjiang reach a series of changes occurred in the lower jingjiang reach after the cutoff project including a river length shortening of 80 6 km a decrease in sinuosity from 2 83 to 1 93 and a hydraulic gradient increase fig 1 yin et al 2007 the evolution of the lower jingjiang reach slowed until the channel in the reach achieved a new balance in 1980 tang 1999 thus the effects of the jingjiang reach cutoff project were concentrated from 1967 to 1980 the ratio of the water sediment diversion at the three inlets apparently decreased from 1967 to 1980 suggesting that much less water and sediment could enter dongting lake through the three inlets fan et al 2008 hu et al 2015 meanwhile dry days at the three inlets increased considerably such as at guanjiapu along the ouchi river where they increased from 17 days yr from 1951 to 1966 to 117 days yr deng et al 2012 consequently water discharge at three inlets decreased much more remarkably than it did during the other periods due to the jingjiang cutoff project figs 3 and 10 water discharge at the three inlets decreased remarkably due to the impact of the jingjiang cutoff project thereby affecting the sediment transport the ssd of the three inlets dropped by 41 from 210 106 t in 1951 1966 to 124 106 t in 1967 1980 with the ssd during the flood season reduced by nearly 50 fig 4b and fig 6a as the most important source of sediment for dongting lake the percentage of ssd from the three inlets was 86 from 1951 to 1966 but it declined remarkably to 77 from 1967 to 1980 after the construction of the cutoff project in the lower jingjiang reach fig 10 the decrease in ssd and ssd percentage at the three inlets indicated that the cutoff project played an important role in the sediment changes at dongting lake 4 3 2 the regulation of the gd and tgd by 2013 more than 50 000 dams had been constructed along the changjiang river which caused a dramatic decrease in fluvial sediment and led to substantial geomorphologic changes yang et al 2005 dai and liu 2013 both water and ssd at the three inlets have presented declining trends since the impoundment of the gd in jan 1981 in addition the decrease in water percentage at the three inlets suggested that the gd had more of an influence on water discharge than it did on ssd fig 2dand fig 10 the tgd the largest dam in the world has a storage capacity of 39 3 109 m3 which is nearly 25 times that of the gd notably the ssd and ssd percentage of the three inlets decreased most significantly during the period of 2004 2014 figs 2 and 10 the ssd dropped from 87 106 t yr from 1981 to 2003 to 9 106 t yr from 2004 to 2014 while the ssd percentage at the three inlets decreased from 78 to 52 almost equal to that of the four waters fig 10 the significant decline in sediment at the three inlets can be directly attributed to the high sediment retention 139 106 t yr of the tgd after 2003 changjiang sediment bulletin 2013 in contrast to the change in ssd at the three inlets the water discharge demonstrated a stable decreasing trend from 2004 to 2014 indicating that the effect of the tgd operation on water discharge was relatively small fig 2c and fig 10 with most sediment being trapped in reservoirs hungry water is prone to erode channel beds and banks to achieve a new equilibrium kondolf 1997 the reach downstream of the tgd namely the yichang chenglingji reach was severely affected with an average thalweg down cutting of 2 m and a total channel erosion volume of 841 106 m3 from october 2002 to october 2013 changjiang sediment bulletin 2007 2013 fig 11 a meanwhile the sites on the mainstream changjiang river showed a trend of down cutting to different extents fig 11c specifically the cross sections of d5 j90 and j186 exhibited serious down cutting with an erosion rates of 0 14 m yr 0 05 m yr and 0 4 m yr respectively in contrast the cross sections of most sites in the dongting lake basin remained unchanged except for xinjiangkou which experienced an erosion rate of 0 1 m yr fig 11d1 moreover the daily mean water level at shashi and jianli in the jingjiang reach decreased by 0 56 m and 0 10 m respectively between 2002 and 2014 under the same water discharge conditions the water level in 2014 was far below that of the pre tgd period this phenomenon can be better observed at shashi fig 11b channel degradation with a declining water surface along the changjiang river further enlarged the topography gradient between the river and the inlets outlets of dongting lake which played a key role in the reduction of water discharge and facilitated the further reduction of the sediment load entering the three inlets from 2004 to 2014 the enlarged topographic gradient between dongting lake and the changjiang river changed the hydrodynamic conditions within dongting lake the mean and peak flow velocity of the dongting lake outlet chenglingji station presented increasing trends from 2007 to 2013 both at high 29 39 m in jun and low water levels 20 84 m in dec jan fig 12 a the rising flow velocities indicated that dongting lake would provide more water and sediment to the changjiang river even during the dry season indeed the ssd of chenglingji presented a significant increasing trend after 2007 furthermore the sediment budget of dongting lake changed from a gain of approximately 120 106 t yr from 1951 to 2003 to a loss of 2 106 t yr from 2004 to 2014 showing that the changjiang river provided sediment to dongting lake before 2003 but extracted sediment from the lake thereafter fig 2b and fig 6 along with the reduction in the sediment source and increase in the outlet flow velocity dongting lake transformed from experiencing deposition to erosion after 2003 which can be confirmed by the shrinking of the ouchi delta in the western part of the edl fig 7 moreover the water dispatch modes of the tgd altered the water regime in the changjiang river downstream from the tgd wang et al 2013 the cross section at nanzui the main entrance of the three inlets to the wdl underwent a slight change from 2007 to 2013 while the flow velocity showed a statistically significant decreasing trend at high water levels 32 26 m in jun jul aug and an increasing trend at low water levels 28 13 m in dec jan feb fig 12b specifically during the high water season the tgd needed to store water for flood control as well as for the water supply in the winter resulting in a decrease in the water sediment load and water velocity into dongting lake through the nanzui station ou et al 2012 wang et al 2013 in contrast during the low water season the tgd released water to satisfy the downstream water demand causing increases in the water and water velocity at the nanzui station fig 12b an increased sediment load at a low water level could partly mitigate the decreased sediment load at a high water level which made the sediment budget of the wdl change slightly and thus resulted in an insignificant change in the erosion deposition pattern fig 7a however the water replenishment during winter can hardly reverse the declining trends during the entire dry season at dongting lake because less water could flow into dongting lake through the three inlets due to the serious erosion of the channel of the changjiang river and more water was delivered to the changjiang river although the dongting lake basin is still likely threatened by flood events in the case of extreme precipitation the tendency of less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season at dongting lake is predictable under the impacts of the tgd 5 conclusions the water regime of lakes worldwide has changed drastically under the combined impacts of global climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities this study focuses on the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake and their impact factors the major findings are as follows 1 the yearly water discharge ssd of dongting lake showed obvious stepwise decreasing trends except for the water discharge at the four waters even though there were seasonal fluctuations in water discharge and ssd from 1951 to 2014 meanwhile the hydrological behavior of dongting exhibited a tendency towards less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season the rating curves of the four waters and chenglingji remained unchanged from 1951 to 2014 while the rating curve of the three inlets shifted from clockwise to counterclockwise from 2004 to 2014 2 the deposition erosion pattern of dongting lake transformed from deposition from 1951 to 2003 to erosion from 2004 to 2014 which was accompanied by a marked drop in the sediment budget of dongting lake and the shrinking of the xiangjiang and ouchi deltas 3 the hydromorphological processes of dongting lake were closely related to climate change and anthropogenic activities for the four waters basin precipitation dominated the water discharge while severe soil erosion and reservoir retention induced an increasing ssd during 1967 1980 and a decreasing ssd during 1981 2014 respectively the hydrological variations at the three inlets were mainly controlled by intensive anthropogenic activities in the changjiang river basin where the jingjiang cutoff project gd and tgd were the main drivers for the decreases in the water and sediment load from 1967 to 1980 1981 to 2003 and 2004 to 2014 respectively the high sediment retention 139 106 t yr behind the tgd directly led to drastic reduction in the sediment input from changjiang to the three inlets the observable increased ssd output from the lake to changjiang after 2007 was caused by tgd induced riverbed incision thus the tgd was responsible for the transformation of the deposition erosion pattern at dongting lake identifying these hydromorphological processes and their associated driving factors is useful for lake management and the regulation of human activity our study reveals that anthropogenic activities have gradually become the principle factors of hydromorphological variations at dongting lake large dams constructed in mainstreams regions have complicated the downstream mechanisms to maintain the relationship between the lake and rivers and prolong the life of the lake more systematic research should be conducted acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc 41576087 41571100 41706093

7221,two dimensional flood inundation models capable of simulating complex spatially and temporally differentiated floodplain flows are routinely used to model and predict flooding however advances in modelling techniques have not been matched by improvements in model validation validation of flood models remains challenging due to a lack of available spatially explicit data traditionally measured data and validation approaches reveal little about the ability of a model to simulate the complex dynamics of floodplain flows including the pathways timeline and impacts of an event in this paper we propose a novel method for the validation of hydraulic models of flooding using quantitative and qualitative volunteered geographic information vgi this method uses vgi data to enhance traditionally measured validation data by reconstructing the observed dynamics of a flood allowing validation of the temporal and spatial simulation of these dynamics we illustrate the method using a case study from corbridge in the northeast of england using vgi collected through participatory research with people affected by severe flooding in 2015 the results of the study demonstrate that vgi data can be used for the effective reconstruction of flood event dynamics the results also reveal that the proposed validation approach is able to identify underperformance in the model s simulation of event dynamics not evaluated by standard global performance measures such a lack of evaluation can have adverse consequences where dynamic model outputs are used locally to influence floodplain management as a result we propose a new framework for model validation adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach to examining event dynamics using a diverse range of data keywords flooding hydraulic modelling model validation volunteered geographic information citizen science 1 introduction flooding is one of the most serious environmental hazards globally with flooding the cause of almost 50 of all economic losses resulting from natural hazards munich re 2013 and losses are likely to increase under climate change as flooding is exacerbated hirabayashi et al 2013 reynard et al 2017 the need to better understand current and future flood risks has led to a significant rise in the use of predictive numeric models to understand river processes including flooding bates and de roo 2000 hunter et al 2007 lane et al 2011a parkes et al 2013 the availability of high quality spatially distributed data on river environments cobby et al 2003 means two dimensional models capable of explicitly simulating complex spatially and temporally differentiated floodplain flows are now a standard approach in many fields including the insurance industry bates and de roo 2000 bradbrook et al 2004 hunter et al 2007 n√©elz and pender 2013 teng et al 2017 however improvements in data and advances in numerical modelling techniques have not been matched by improvements in the validation of these models the process by which we can assess whether our models agree with observations refsgaard and henriksen 2004 established approaches to validation are typically spatially or temporally limited in scope by the availability of accurate datasets this paper seeks to address gaps in our existing data and practices of model validation using a case study from northeast england we propose a new approach which builds on existing statistical methods of comparison against observed data we demonstrate that by exploiting diverse volunteered and crowd sourced datasets we can both spatially and temporally reconstruct the key dynamics of flood events the approach demonstrates how alternative data sources can be used to enhance existing data providing information on flooding processes for which traditionally regarded data is rarely available finally the approach offers a more holistic validation of the complex dynamics of floodplain flows including the pathways timeline and impacts of events 2 application of volunteered geographic information in hazard assessment 2 1 vgi data in disaster risk reduction paucity of measured data on disasters including floods is common in the field of disaster risk reduction drr to address this issue research has explored the use of non standard unscientific datasets derived from local communities within a disaster zone goodchild and glennon 2010 one data source being explored within drr research is volunteered geographic data vgi haklay et al 2014 defined as the widespread engagement of large numbers of private citizens often with little in the way of formal qualifications in the creation of geographic information goodchild 2007 p 212 vgi datasets include any geo located information on a disaster and can comprise a diverse range of data including personal accounts photographs and videos and crowd sourced measurements hung et al 2016 mcdougall 2012 triglav cekada and radovan 2013 the use of vgi datasets has been demonstrated across a wide range of studies of hazard events for systematic reviews of the current research base see granell and ostermann 2016 and klonner et al 2016 for floods the use of vgi data has been demonstrated across a range of applications for instance mccallum et al 2016 utilised vgi to improve the availability of pre event data on flood vulnerability in data sparse regions demonstrating how crowd sourced information can enhance mapping for emergency responders after disasters a number of studies have also explored the potential for collecting vgi datasets to inform real time disaster response for example wan et al 2014 at a global scale and degrossi et al 2014 and horita et al 2015 both working at city scale in brazil demonstrated cloud based systems for the collection and processing of vgi flooding data these systems synthesised diverse flooding datasets providing real time information for emergency response and developed a long term database of information on historic floods vgi has also been used in the post event phase schnebele and cervone 2013 and triglav cekada and radovan 2013 utilised vgi flooding imagery collected after the event to improve flood maps derived from satellite imagery such research demonstrates how the vgi data can provide spatially distributed information on even large flood events and how it can also be used to validate remotely sensed hazard maps at a local scale while these examples demonstrate the emerging widespread application of vgi for disaster preparedness and response they also demonstrate how limited and fragmented the use of vgi data is for many applications reflecting the non standard nature of the data mccallum et al 2016 use only participatory mapping for their vulnerability assessment whilst schnebele and cervone 2013 and triglav cekada and radovan 2013 use only imagery for their flood mapping analysis wan et al 2014 degrossi et al 2014 and horita et al 2015 collected a wider range of data including citizen reports of flooding but highlighted significant problems utilising such diverse datasets which cannot be automatically processed other criticisms of vgi datasets often focus on issues of data validity or the difficulties of assessing data quality in the absence of traditionally measured data sources hung et al 2016 muller et al 2015 as a result many studies use collection of vgi data as an adjunct to traditional data rather than as a source of data in its own right or as a standalone method for the creation of new knowledge about specific hazards such as flooding us√≥n et al 2016 2 2 emerging practices of engagement in contrast to the vgi projects noted in section 2 1 citizen science and citizen observatory programmes represent moves towards establishing new practices of geo spatial knowledge co creation these efforts are driven by the need for greater public participation in environmental decision making national research council 2008 laid out in the aarhus convention lee and abbot 2003 and the european floods directive wehn et al 2015 citizen science and citizen observatories have been demonstrated across a range of disciplines including flooding and hydrology lanfranchi et al 2014 muller et al 2015 ruiz mall√©n et al 2016 starkey et al 2017 and research has begun to demonstrate how citizen led locally collected data can provide valuable information for enhancing our understanding of catchment processes and planning catchment interventions starkey et al 2017 in contrast to the often ad hoc collection of vgi data citizen science typically involves engaged and trained participants and rigid data collection frameworks to help overcome issues of data validity wiggins and he 2016 however an issues arises flood events in common with other disasters represent situations in which data can often only be collected in an ad hoc fashion as the presence of local volunteers able and willing to collect data cannot be guaranteed starkey et al 2017 this is particularly relevant as citizen science programmes are often limited to small numbers of participants baruch et al 2016 meaning drop outs during an event would have a greater impact on the data collected efforts therefore need to be made to understand how we can integrate the opportunities for large scale engagement represented by vgi with the opportunities for local participation and the improvements in data quality represented by citizen science studies have begun to explore how integrating citizens into activities beyond simple data collection can improve engagement and data quality for example see starkey et al 2017 but in the context of flooding this field is still in its infancy however there is obvious potential for a more integrated approach between large scale vgi data collection and the more locally focused nature of citizen science see brandeis and carrera zamanillo 2017 for further details 2 3 integrating citizen data into the validation of flood inundation models one situation which potentially offers the opportunity to integrate citizen science and vgi in this way is in the construction and validation of numerical flood inundation models of flood affected communities flood inundation modelling forms a cornerstone of flood risk assessment bates and de roo 2000 hunter et al 2007 lane et al 2011a parkes et al 2013 it informs almost all flood management activities from monitoring and warning systems nester et al 2016 to evacuation planning simonovic and ahmad 2005 and emergency response coles et al 2017 to the design and construction of future developments pappenberger et al 2007a however at present flood modelling is primarily an expert led activity with little or no citizen involvement lane et al 2011b the established approach to validating inundation model outputs is to match available historical data to simulated outputs pappenberger et al 2007a the goodness of fit between predicted and observed river levels can be assessed using statistical best fit techniques such as nash sutcliffe model efficiency nsme nash and sutcliffe 1970 or root mean square error rmse altenau et al 2017 similarly point in time global flood extents can also be assessed using binary performance measures such as the critical success index c which compares the extent of simulated inundation to the observed inundation wing et al 2017 what tests are undertaken is dependent upon data availability in channel river level data is a source of historical information commonly available in medium and large catchments hunter et al 2007 parkes et al 2013 to examine out of bank inundation high resolution aerial and satellite imagery renschler and wang 2017 multiband remote sensing such as landsat fern√°ndez et al 2016 jung et al 2014 or other sensors such as synthetic aperture radar garc√≠a pintado et al 2013 pappenberger et al 2007b wood et al 2016 can all be used studies have also demonstrated the usefulness of ground observations of wrack and water marks in reconstructing maximum inundation extents and levels neal et al 2009 parkes et al 2013 segura beltr√°n et al 2016 however collection of this latter form of flood inundation evidence typically requires post event surveys which are time and resource consuming and often yield spatially limited results segura beltr√°n et al 2016 the validation of model outputs is therefore constrained by data availability to being either spatially or temporally limited gauged river levels may record levels throughout an event but are limited to discrete locations whilst remote sensing can provide spatially extensive information on inundation but only at discrete time points consequently established statistical techniques for model validation have been unable to assess the effectiveness of models in simulating both spatial and temporal event dynamics hunter et al 2007 these dynamics include the pathways which water takes across the floodplain the flood timeline and local variation in flood impacts all of which are capable of being simulated in detail by current 2d inundation models teng et al 2017 this disparity between the complexity of current inundation models and the relative lack of data against which to test them represents an opportunity to integrate citizen collected data into existing expert led practices of knowledge creation thus far however there has been little exploration of this issue 3 methods in this research we build on the methodology used by smith et al 2012 by demonstrating how vgi data should be used more routinely for model validation as a dataset in its own right smith et al 2012 provide a demonstration of the use of a diverse vgi database to construct and validate a model of coastal flood defence overtopping they utilise vgi to build the model by using locally recorded locations of flood defence overtopping as point inflows into the model domain they also validate its outputs reconstructing the observed flood extents and depths at properties using historical photographs and media accounts however the approach demonstrated was limited by the data used which was confined to imagery and records of depth at specific locations by examining only modelled extent and depth the method provides a spatial but not a temporal validation the resultant model cannot examine the functioning of the model in simulating flood dynamics in more detail nor does the study explore how vgi could be used more comprehensively this is reflected in smith et al s conclusion that the data used represented useful corroborating evidence for the performance of the model p 43 after a more traditional validation using available measured data in this study we develop an experimental validation methodology which uses a wide range of data potentially available through vgi and participatory research approaches to examine different aspects of a simulation output to demonstrate the method we use a database of vgi to reconstruct in detail a severe flood in the northeast of england and use a vgi based flood reconstruction to validate the outputs of a 2d flood inundation model of the event finally we compare the outputs to more established methods of validation to demonstrate the success of the method 3 1 model build we utilised the flood inundation model lisflood fp to produce simulated flood event outputs for our case study lisflood fp is a 2d finite difference model developed specifically to utilise high resolution topographic data to simulate floodplain dynamics bates et al 2010 hunter et al 2005 neal et al 2012 2011 bates and de roo 2000 although we used lisflood fp here the validation approach developed should be considered generic and is designed to be applicable to any 2d model that predicts dynamic floodplain inundation the principle data requirements for the model are outlined in table 1 3 1 1 the case study the 2015 corbridge flood the test case used in this study is the market town of corbridge located in the tyne valley in the northeast of england fig 1 corbridge was chosen to develop and test the experimental validation because of its recent history of severe flooding and the way its population were already engaged with ongoing flood research rollason et al 2018 corbridge experienced extensive flooding when storm desmond resulted in record rainfall across areas of the north of england barker et al 2016 on 5th december 2015 the flood an event with a return period estimated to be between 100 and 200 years marsh et al 2016 overtopped the flood defences at corbridge and inundated 70 properties on the south side of the river tyne environment agency 2016 using lisflood fp a model of the river tyne was constructed extending for approximately 30 km with corbridge situated approximately half way down the modelled reach fig 1 shows the modelled reach and the main data used are discussed in table 1 to predict the december 2015 flood event the model was run for a 72 h period starting at 12 00 on friday 4th december continuing until 12 00 on monday 7th december this period covered both the rising and falling limbs of the main hydrograph at corbridge simulation results were generated for every 15 min period predicting flood depths flood velocity and time of inundation 3 2 validating the model outputs using established approaches initial verification and calibration of the model was undertaken during the model build the mesh resolution independence of the model was verified by testing against dem resolutions of 5 0 7 5 10 0 and 20 0 m hardy et al 1999 horritt and bates 2001 the model was further calibrated against floodplain friction values which were estimated from chow 1959 based on satellite imagery and field visits differential friction values were applied to the channel of the tyne and the main floodplain with the area of the channel delineated based on satellite imagery manning s values for floodplain friction between 0 02 and 0 06 m1 3 s 1 and channel friction values between 0 03 and 0 07 m1 3 s 1 were used in the model calibration runs validation of which was undertaken using established statistical approaches validation was also undertaken on the calibrated model as a baseline against which to test the effectiveness of the experimental methodology two datasets were available for the validation using established statistical techniques gauged river levels and observed flood extents for the estimated maximum extent gauged river levels were validated using both nash sutcliffe model efficiency nsme and root mean square error rmse altenau et al 2017 maximum flood extents were validated using the critical success index c wing et al 2017 wood et al 2016 sometimes referred to as the fit statistic sampson et al 2015 c tests the proportion of wet observed data that is replicated by the model on a per pixel basis accounting for both over and under prediction c m 1 o 1 m 1 o 1 m 0 o 1 m 1 o 0 where m is the modelled outcome and o is the observed outcome and 1 or 0 represents pixels that are either wet or dry c can range from 0 no match between simulated and observed inundation to 1 perfect match between simulated and observed inundation 3 3 developing a new solution for validating inundation models 3 3 1 the volunteered geographic information database participatory research in corbridge was undertaken with the community at to develop a vgi database of local knowledge and experiences of the december 2015 flooding event as part of wider participatory work being undertaken at corbridge see rollason et al 2018 we carried out two participatory mapping workshops with 10 research participants and five individual walking interviews after evans and jones 2011 discussions and interviews were un or semi structured in nature dowling et al 2016 with participants being encouraged to lead the discussion and discuss their own knowledge and experiences during the mapping workshops participants were encouraged to locate their knowledge on blank maps of the study area for example observed locations of defence overtopping or pathways of flood water flow walking interviews were also participant led following either the natural go along kusenbach 2003 or participatory walking interview clark and emmel 2008 models spatial data were recorded either directly into gis or onto paper maps for later digitisation verbal discussions were recorded and analysed by adopting a grounded theory approach charmaz 2011 combining both the audio recording and visual representations knigge and cope 2006 information provided in anecdotal accounts was triangulated with digital images and video taken during the event and collected during the participatory process the information were used to produce an extensive database of how the flood occurred table 2 most of the data was collected from the local community but it was augmented by non georeferenced footage from an unmanned aerial vehicle uav identified on news footage immediately after the event and collected by a local uav enthusiast 3 3 2 using the vgi database to reconstruct the dynamics of a severe flood during validation it is necessary to establish the main dynamics of the flooding event for which the model is being validated to do this we divided the vgi data into three information categories 1 pathways data which provided information on the movement of flood water through the study area including areas of overtopping and principle flow directions 2 impacts data which provided information on the maximum extent of the flooding 3 timeline data which provided information on the timing of key events during the flood including overtopping of defences arrival of flood water at key locations and inundation of properties mapped data and personal accounts anecdotal data were combined into a single vector layer within a gis with the anecdotal data included within the layer as specific or linked attribute data following the qualitative gis approaches of cope and elwood 2009 this layer was used to reconstruct a unified account of the event dynamics including times of overtopping and inundation of properties photographs and videos were georeferenced and quantitative information was extracted where possible for example the location of wrack or height of flood marks or the direction of gravel deposition showing flow pathways where quantitative data was not collected directly images were used simply for interpretation and to validate other data sources perks et al 2016 have demonstrated how georeferenced uav data can allow precise quantification of flood flows and flow vectors for an urban situation in scotland however the uav footage collected during the corbridge study was obtained opportunistically and as a result did not contain the necessary metadata or ground control point information to allow it to be georeferenced it was thus used in an analytical manner using darker surface colours or isolated water bodies to indicate previous areas of inundation renschler and wang 2017 in areas where no footage was available interpolation of the flood extent was undertaken based on expert judgement and using lidar topography 3 3 3 quality control of vgi data the vgi dataset collected for this study is fragmentary and format messy this makes the assessment of data quality using traditional quantitative measures difficult however it is still necessary to assess the extent to which we can have confidence in the data and the flood event reconstruction derived from it and to do this we adopted the approach of mays and pope 2000 this validation approach uses a researcher led reflexive approach relying on triangulation of different data sources to assess and validate individual pieces of information for example the comparison of anecdotal accounts with imagery or physical evidence on the ground this approach does not provide the quantifiable analysis of error normally required for model validation instead the method identifies areas of error and uncertainty spatial and temporal or contested knowledge which can arise due to the nature of the vgi data being used 3 3 4 the experimental framework for model validation the experimental validation brought together the flood event reconstruction derived from the vgi database with the outputs of the lisflood fp model which represent the dynamics of the event the outputs showed dynamic flood depths and flow vectors times of inundation and maximum flood extents flood depths and times of inundation were extracted directly from the model at user defined time steps in raster grid format as a velocity output the model produces grids representing the flow of water between grid cells in both the x and y directions to convert these velocity grids into flow vectors the saga gis tool gradient vectors from directional components conrad et al 2015 was used an average across 4 grid cells 40 m was used to reveal underlying flow directions which could be compared against the observed evidence fig 2 shows the experimental approach and the vgi datasets used to validate the different dynamics of the event 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of the model outputs using established methods table 3 shows that the model performed consistently well in simulating gauged water levels along the whole modelled reach with a floodplain manning s n of between 0 03 and 0 07 m1 3 s 1 and a dem resolution of either 10 or 20 m this dem resolution is in line with the recommendations of the uk environment agency fluvial design guide crower 2009 which suggests model resolutions of 25 m in rural areas and 10 m for urban areas it is also in line with other catchment or sub regional studies although there is significant variation in the resolutions used gobeyn et al 2017 neal et al 2011 renschler and wang 2017 savage et al 2016 wing et al 2017 some studies have demonstrated the use of very high resolution topographic information for example sampson et al 2012 but these are exclusively applied to small scale urban studies rather than the larger rural reaches such as that simulated in the current study table 3 also indicates the goodness of fit measured by the critical success index c between the simulated and observed maximum flood extents within the study area the results indicate that all of the tested parameter sets achieved greater than 85 success in matching the observed peak flood extents the calibrated model achieved a 90 success rate which compares very favourably with other modelling studies which achieved between 50 and 90 success rates renschler and wang 2017 wing et al 2017 at a local scale visual assessment of the simulated and observed extents fig 3 show that within the area of interest there was considerable variability in areas of over and underestimation in particular the model overestimated the extent of overtopping of the flood defences at dilston haugh fig 3 location a and at the rugby club fig 3 location b whilst it underestimated the extent of flooding on dilston haugh it is considered likely that the bare earth dem vegetation and buildings removed used in the model contained inaccuracies which influenced the flow of water across the floodplain which will be discussed further below 4 2 application of the experimental validation approach 4 2 1 reconstruction of the 2015 event dynamics fig 4 shows the reconstruction of the dynamics of the december 2015 flood undertaken using the vgi database these can be divided into two types of dynamics pathways of defence overtopping and pathways of flow across the floodplain the results indicated three pathways of defence overtopping fp1 fp3 and fp4 fp1 and fp3 represented generalised overtopping of the defences the extent of which is indicated on fig 4 whereas fp4 was identified as a specific location of overtopping at the junction between two defence types which resulted in a distinct flow of water onto the cricket club from the north two pathways of flow across the floodplain were also reconstructed fp2 represented a general flow from the upstream areas of overtopping following the topography of the floodplain fp5 represented backing up of water that was unable to return back to the river as a result of the flood defence and the high water levels in the river this was manifested in the data as a reported sudden increase in depth at properties between 19 00 and 20 00 gmt on 5th december two main areas of impact were also represented at the stanners fig 4 fi1 and station road fig 4 fi2 although the distribution of properties affected by the flooding event was greater than that shown no data was available to validate the impacts in these other areas 4 3 results of the experimental validation the calibrated model was validated against the key pathways timings and impacts of the december 2015 flood identified in section 4 2 4 3 1 validation of flood pathways pathways were identified from the model simulation using 15 min resolution time series outputs of depth and velocity fig 5 shows the results of the validation the results indicate that the model was successful in simulating all of the major pathways identified in the observed data in the case of fp1 and fp2 the model showed general overtopping of the defences along dilston haugh and flow following low lying areas of the floodplain topography which are potentially relict river channels this is further north on the floodplain than was interpreted from the vgi and is considered to reflect error within the vgi rather than in the model this is because these flow pathways were not directly observed by the research participants instead they were inferred from the direction of flood waters which entered their homes for fp3 and fp4 the model showed successful differentiation between the two pathways fp3 was simulated as overtopping of the wall at lion court and there is also a distinct overtopping location at fp4 this results in flow across the cricket club from the north reported by research participants which is separate to the other flooding at and around lion court the processes behind the time line of fp5 were the most contested within the vgi with participants reporting a sudden increase in depth at the stanners and station road fig 5 but with considerable disagreement over the pathway this water had taken review of the flow vectors produced by the model for this area was not conclusive in identifying a simple backflow of water however calculation of the change in simulated inundation depth at the stanners does show a significant increase in depth in the area which corresponds to the observed pattern and timing of flooding this suggests that the model is accurately simulating the observed flooding situation however whether or not the processes underlying this simulation are accurate cannot be validated with the available data 4 3 2 validation of flood timeline the success of the model at simulating the timings of the december 2015 flood was assessed based on the 15 min resolution time series animations produced by the model table 4 shows the simulated timeline against the observed timings and demonstrates that the model was successful at predicting the timings of pathways fp1 4 as it simulated the pathways in the observed order and either at the correct time or within the time periods identified by participants in simulating fp5 the model showed a significant increase in depth in these areas from 18 30 gmt onwards fig 5 where it showed a 30 min offset from the observed time however it is also possible this offset reflected variation in the timing of the effect observed by participants rather than any error in the model itself 4 3 3 validation of flood impacts section 3 has already outlined the partial validation of the flood extents of the 5th december 2015 flood event which demonstrated that the model achieved 90 global accuracy in simulating maximum flood extent and water levels however the simulation of local water levels and hence flood depth can also be assessed using quantitative data on flood levels derived from imagery obtained across the area of interest eighteen images were collected as part of the research that could be used for the validation of these 12 were capable of being used for validation of flood impacts with 4 located along the dilston haugh flood defence two each at the stanners and station road and three at the cricket club fig 5 providing coverage of the majority of the study area eight of these images provided information on the maximum flooded depth and could be used to quantify the variation in observed and simulated depths four images did not provide any direct information on maximum depths but provided a minimum constraint to simulated maximum depths as they showed inundation depths on sunday 6th december on the waning limb of the flood hydrograph table 5 shows that there was variable success in the simulation of local flood depths along the flood embankment at dilston haugh table 5 photographs 1 5 the model consistently underestimated flood depths overtopping the flood embankment by an average of 0 25 m and up to a maximum of 0 50 m at the stanners and the cricket club table 5 photographs 8 9 and 12 the model was more successful with the difference between interpreted and simulated depths of only 0 02 m and 0 16 m respectively for those images which provided only a minimum constraint to the simulated depths the modelled depth exceeded the minimum constraint in all cases these results suggest that there were disparities in the way that the model simulated the flow of water into and or out of the study area the underestimation of depths along the dilston haugh defences suggested that this pathway was not correctly simulated with too little flood water overtopping the defences at this location that local flood depths at the stanners and the cricket club were more accurate suggesting that overtopping at this location might be too great these results were substantiated by the maximum extent results fig 3 which showed overtopping of the embankments at the rugby club something not reported in the vgi database taken together these results demonstrated that at a local scale simulation of inundation depths and extents was quite variable this was despite the model showing high levels of accuracy at a global scale these results likely reflect inaccuracies in the bare earth dem which influenced simulated flow at a local scale these inaccuracies could potentially have been introduced either during the pre processing filtering process or during the resampling of the data from 2 m to 10 m resolution 5 discussion this paper has introduced a new approach to flood model validation the approach uses a vgi database collected during and immediately after a severe flood event to reconstruct and validate event dynamics this approach builds on traditional statistical approaches which are typically spatially or temporally limited and do not give a full picture of how an inundation model is performing at a local scale the approach has been tested using a vgi database collected following a severe flood which occurred at corbridge uk in december 2015 5 1 evaluating the success of the experimental validation method the results of the research demonstrate that the experimental approach offers a more comprehensive validation of event dynamics than offered by traditional statistical approaches at a global scale established quantitative validation methods were used to assess the goodness of fit between simulated and observed water levels at river gauges and between observed and simulated maximum flooded extents the simulation shows rmse values of 0 5 and nse values of 0 9 at all available gauges and a 90 accuracy in simulating the observed maximum extents this is equal to or better than other similar modelling studies using lisflood fp renschler and wang 2017 wing et al 2017 and suggests that the model is successfully simulating the inundation seen during the december 2015 flood event however these established metrics only provide an incomplete spatially and temporally limited validation of the model performance hunter et al 2007 the results of the experimental method outlined indicate that the more comprehensive validation is able to identify areas of model under performance not identified by established global statistical approaches in particular the experimental validation shows that although the model accurately simulates the timeline and locations of flood pathways it incorrectly simulates the processes of overtopping and consequently local inundation depths these results likely reflect localised inaccuracies in the underlying 10 m resolution dem used for the model or the need for greater spatial variability in the parameterisation of roughness both which could influence the flow of water across the floodplain which is not identified at a global scale this would have potentially serious consequences if the model was to be used for local emergency response planning or informing for example population evacuation strategies simonovic and ahmad 2005 5 2 vgi data as an alternative to established data sources fig 6 categorises the data used in the study according to its qualitative quantitative nature and its degree of certainty in comparison to more established data sources fig 6 shows how the vgi data is set apart from traditional data in its range of sources and how it comprises a blend of quantitative semi quantitative and qualitative data the study demonstrates that this range of data sources makes it possible to understand and reconstruct flood event dynamics using the vgi data as a standalone dataset as shown through the validation of the flood timeline and local scale pathways and impacts presented here vgi data offers opportunities for validating aspects of the flood inundation models at spatial and temporal scales which would be almost impossible using traditional means this makes vgi a valuable alternative to traditional data sources not just for immediate post disaster response and recovery haworth and bruce 2015 but also as a longer term source of data to inform scientific analysis granell and ostermann 2016 this range of data sources has also been shown to be important to achieving a valid vgi dataset particularly where a mixture of qualitative quantitative data prevents the application of statistical metrics previous studies using more single format databases have highlighted data validity as a limitation of vgi data e g klonner et al 2016 however we have demonstrated the usefulness of adopting a much more flexible and interpretative model of data assessment based on triangulation with different data sources mays and pope 2000 sousa 2014 wiggins and he 2016 5 3 a new framework for validating flood inundation models this study has demonstrated a new approach to the validation of flood inundation models with the aim being simulation of underlying event dynamics through better incorporation of vgi the study has also demonstrated the usefulness of community generated vgi data as a primary input to the future validation of flood models building on these findings we suggest a new framework for the validation of flood models fig 7 the proposed framework builds on current statistical approaches to validation by recognising the ability of current numerical models to simulate complex event dynamics and the wider diversity of data which this study has shown to be applicable to model validation the framework represents a three stage process 5 3 1 data processing the framework encourages a flexible and researcher driven approach to assessing data validity which should reflect the data collected in its methods and outcome as the fields of citizen science and vgi continue to evolve and mature new practices of data collection and quality assessment will no doubt emerge granell and ostermann 2016 hung et al 2016 greater standardisation through structures such as citizen observatories represent one way in which data collection might be expanded and improved lanfranchi et al 2014 wehn et al 2015 future improvements in personal technology will also likely make uav data perks et al 2016 smith 2015 and geo located citizen data from personal electronic devices newman et al 2012 tang et al 2017 more widely available taking these potential future developments into account the framework aims to encourage the use of a wide range of data in many formats to allow cross referencing and triangulation between data sources 5 3 2 event dynamics the framework proposes pathways timeline and impacts as broad categories through which principle event dynamics can be defined this includes the traditionally assessed metrics of in channel gauged levels and maximum inundation extents but recognises that for many uses the parameterisation of numerical models in terms of these metrics alone is overly simplistic by assessing a wider range of processes within the framework we can develop a more holistic validation and ensure that the dynamic simulation capabilities of modern numeric models are exploited to their full potential 5 3 3 validation methods the framework adopts the same flexible approach to the validation of simulated dynamics as to data assessment this recognises that different input data simulations and dynamics require different approaches to validation three broad types are proposed statistical incorporating established performance measures wing et al 2017 analytical reflecting semi quantitative approaches such as the analysis of uav footage and quantitative imagery demonstrated by this study and visual encompassing all techniques which rely on on the face of it validation rykiel 1996 the latter would include the assessment of pathways against the dynamic simulation outputs demonstrated in this study the balance of validation techniques should reflect both the availability of simulation outputs and the availability of suitable data against which to validate them the final validation produced by the framework is a flexible one influenced by the dynamics of the event the data available and methods adopted the final result will likely lack the quantitative rigour of established statistical methods based on the results of this study we propose that some degree of inaccuracy and uncertainty can be accepted in return for the benefit of achieving a more comprehensive understanding of complex flood event dynamics granell and ostermann 2016 by adopting a more flexible approach to using vgi data in this way we can improve model validation and furthermore open up the currently expert led practices of flood risk assessment to greater public participation us√≥n et al 2016 6 conclusions numerical models are the foundation of flood risk assessment and management used for understanding and mapping areas at risk from floods and planning management interventions recent improvements in computing power and model code and increases in the availability of spatially distributed data on floodplain environments have increased the popularity of 2d models for providing detailed simulations of complex flood dynamics however improvements in model simulations have not been accompanied by corresponding improvements in model validation due to a lack of data from during and immediately after flooding events validation of flood inundation models still grounded in the statistical assessment of spatially and temporally limited datasets such as remotely sensed flood extents or in channel river gauging the research presented in this study has demonstrated a new approach to the validation of flood inundation models using vgi data to provide information on event dynamics not captured by traditionally measured datasets in so doing we have demonstrated that 1 by collecting a wide range of vgi data from multiple sources it is possible to reconstruct in detail the dynamics of a severe flood although statistical validation is less rigorous the quality of this reconstruction can be assessed through data triangulation and other qualitative approaches 2 the reconstruction of flood pathways timeline and impacts of flooding can be used to validate the dynamic outputs of a 2d flood inundation model and allow both spatial and temporal examination of model performance in simulating flooding processes 3 the experimental model validation approach tested here enhances existing global statistical approaches to validation by examining the simulation of underlying flood processes using the case study of a large flood on the river tyne uk the results of the test case indicate that a model assessed using traditional methods as having a global accuracy of over 90 in simulating gauged river levels and maximum flood extent does not accurately represent the actual pathways and impacts of the event this is potentially highly significant when models are used in a dynamic way to plan and assess floodplain management interventions drawing on these conclusions we propose a new flexible framework for the validation of flood inundation models in contrast to current approaches the framework encourages the use of a diverse range of non traditional data now and into the future similarly the framework encourages a mixture of approaches to validation to be adopted leading to more flexibility depending on data availability and aspects of the simulation being considered although the final validation may lack the quantitative rigour of established global approaches it provides a more comprehensive and bespoke examination of the model s performance particularly for situations where dynamic model outputs are being used to inform potential floodplain interventions the results shown by this study also demonstrate the value of alternative data sources such as vgi or data collected from citizen science programmes to enhance and extend established data sources we have demonstrated that many of the common criticisms of alternative data being messy and unscientific can be understood or overcome by relatively simple procedures for quality control such as triangulation however data is as demonstrated by other studies not always as diverse or spatially distributed as that collected in this study a fact that must be considered when translating this approach to other areas for triangulation to be effective a mixture of overlapping data from different informants and from different sources e g anecdotal remote sensing imagery is essential additionally all of these data need to be located both spatially and temporally within the study area or event of interest this necessitates further research on the development of data collection approaches which combine the locally situated engagement adopted in this study with structured data collection approaches of citizen science or citizen observatories and the spatial coverage of technology based vgi approaches with predicted increases in the risk of flooding as a result of future climate change numerical models are likely to continue to represent a significant asset in flood risk assessment practices the vgi framework proposed here represents a more comprehensive process of model validation based on the more effective use of alternative data sources this has the benefit of both allowing more comprehensive exploitation of modern numerical modelling to better simulate complex river floodplain interactions and also encouraging the exploration and use of diverse datasets which may open up new perspectives on the use of numerical models for the creation flood risk knowledge to effectively integrate the proposed validation framework into future modelling work further research is urgently required in order to explore how technological vgi solutions could be developed to allow the routine collection of flood data through local engagement platforms such as citizen observatories 7 declarations of

7221,two dimensional flood inundation models capable of simulating complex spatially and temporally differentiated floodplain flows are routinely used to model and predict flooding however advances in modelling techniques have not been matched by improvements in model validation validation of flood models remains challenging due to a lack of available spatially explicit data traditionally measured data and validation approaches reveal little about the ability of a model to simulate the complex dynamics of floodplain flows including the pathways timeline and impacts of an event in this paper we propose a novel method for the validation of hydraulic models of flooding using quantitative and qualitative volunteered geographic information vgi this method uses vgi data to enhance traditionally measured validation data by reconstructing the observed dynamics of a flood allowing validation of the temporal and spatial simulation of these dynamics we illustrate the method using a case study from corbridge in the northeast of england using vgi collected through participatory research with people affected by severe flooding in 2015 the results of the study demonstrate that vgi data can be used for the effective reconstruction of flood event dynamics the results also reveal that the proposed validation approach is able to identify underperformance in the model s simulation of event dynamics not evaluated by standard global performance measures such a lack of evaluation can have adverse consequences where dynamic model outputs are used locally to influence floodplain management as a result we propose a new framework for model validation adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach to examining event dynamics using a diverse range of data keywords flooding hydraulic modelling model validation volunteered geographic information citizen science 1 introduction flooding is one of the most serious environmental hazards globally with flooding the cause of almost 50 of all economic losses resulting from natural hazards munich re 2013 and losses are likely to increase under climate change as flooding is exacerbated hirabayashi et al 2013 reynard et al 2017 the need to better understand current and future flood risks has led to a significant rise in the use of predictive numeric models to understand river processes including flooding bates and de roo 2000 hunter et al 2007 lane et al 2011a parkes et al 2013 the availability of high quality spatially distributed data on river environments cobby et al 2003 means two dimensional models capable of explicitly simulating complex spatially and temporally differentiated floodplain flows are now a standard approach in many fields including the insurance industry bates and de roo 2000 bradbrook et al 2004 hunter et al 2007 n√©elz and pender 2013 teng et al 2017 however improvements in data and advances in numerical modelling techniques have not been matched by improvements in the validation of these models the process by which we can assess whether our models agree with observations refsgaard and henriksen 2004 established approaches to validation are typically spatially or temporally limited in scope by the availability of accurate datasets this paper seeks to address gaps in our existing data and practices of model validation using a case study from northeast england we propose a new approach which builds on existing statistical methods of comparison against observed data we demonstrate that by exploiting diverse volunteered and crowd sourced datasets we can both spatially and temporally reconstruct the key dynamics of flood events the approach demonstrates how alternative data sources can be used to enhance existing data providing information on flooding processes for which traditionally regarded data is rarely available finally the approach offers a more holistic validation of the complex dynamics of floodplain flows including the pathways timeline and impacts of events 2 application of volunteered geographic information in hazard assessment 2 1 vgi data in disaster risk reduction paucity of measured data on disasters including floods is common in the field of disaster risk reduction drr to address this issue research has explored the use of non standard unscientific datasets derived from local communities within a disaster zone goodchild and glennon 2010 one data source being explored within drr research is volunteered geographic data vgi haklay et al 2014 defined as the widespread engagement of large numbers of private citizens often with little in the way of formal qualifications in the creation of geographic information goodchild 2007 p 212 vgi datasets include any geo located information on a disaster and can comprise a diverse range of data including personal accounts photographs and videos and crowd sourced measurements hung et al 2016 mcdougall 2012 triglav cekada and radovan 2013 the use of vgi datasets has been demonstrated across a wide range of studies of hazard events for systematic reviews of the current research base see granell and ostermann 2016 and klonner et al 2016 for floods the use of vgi data has been demonstrated across a range of applications for instance mccallum et al 2016 utilised vgi to improve the availability of pre event data on flood vulnerability in data sparse regions demonstrating how crowd sourced information can enhance mapping for emergency responders after disasters a number of studies have also explored the potential for collecting vgi datasets to inform real time disaster response for example wan et al 2014 at a global scale and degrossi et al 2014 and horita et al 2015 both working at city scale in brazil demonstrated cloud based systems for the collection and processing of vgi flooding data these systems synthesised diverse flooding datasets providing real time information for emergency response and developed a long term database of information on historic floods vgi has also been used in the post event phase schnebele and cervone 2013 and triglav cekada and radovan 2013 utilised vgi flooding imagery collected after the event to improve flood maps derived from satellite imagery such research demonstrates how the vgi data can provide spatially distributed information on even large flood events and how it can also be used to validate remotely sensed hazard maps at a local scale while these examples demonstrate the emerging widespread application of vgi for disaster preparedness and response they also demonstrate how limited and fragmented the use of vgi data is for many applications reflecting the non standard nature of the data mccallum et al 2016 use only participatory mapping for their vulnerability assessment whilst schnebele and cervone 2013 and triglav cekada and radovan 2013 use only imagery for their flood mapping analysis wan et al 2014 degrossi et al 2014 and horita et al 2015 collected a wider range of data including citizen reports of flooding but highlighted significant problems utilising such diverse datasets which cannot be automatically processed other criticisms of vgi datasets often focus on issues of data validity or the difficulties of assessing data quality in the absence of traditionally measured data sources hung et al 2016 muller et al 2015 as a result many studies use collection of vgi data as an adjunct to traditional data rather than as a source of data in its own right or as a standalone method for the creation of new knowledge about specific hazards such as flooding us√≥n et al 2016 2 2 emerging practices of engagement in contrast to the vgi projects noted in section 2 1 citizen science and citizen observatory programmes represent moves towards establishing new practices of geo spatial knowledge co creation these efforts are driven by the need for greater public participation in environmental decision making national research council 2008 laid out in the aarhus convention lee and abbot 2003 and the european floods directive wehn et al 2015 citizen science and citizen observatories have been demonstrated across a range of disciplines including flooding and hydrology lanfranchi et al 2014 muller et al 2015 ruiz mall√©n et al 2016 starkey et al 2017 and research has begun to demonstrate how citizen led locally collected data can provide valuable information for enhancing our understanding of catchment processes and planning catchment interventions starkey et al 2017 in contrast to the often ad hoc collection of vgi data citizen science typically involves engaged and trained participants and rigid data collection frameworks to help overcome issues of data validity wiggins and he 2016 however an issues arises flood events in common with other disasters represent situations in which data can often only be collected in an ad hoc fashion as the presence of local volunteers able and willing to collect data cannot be guaranteed starkey et al 2017 this is particularly relevant as citizen science programmes are often limited to small numbers of participants baruch et al 2016 meaning drop outs during an event would have a greater impact on the data collected efforts therefore need to be made to understand how we can integrate the opportunities for large scale engagement represented by vgi with the opportunities for local participation and the improvements in data quality represented by citizen science studies have begun to explore how integrating citizens into activities beyond simple data collection can improve engagement and data quality for example see starkey et al 2017 but in the context of flooding this field is still in its infancy however there is obvious potential for a more integrated approach between large scale vgi data collection and the more locally focused nature of citizen science see brandeis and carrera zamanillo 2017 for further details 2 3 integrating citizen data into the validation of flood inundation models one situation which potentially offers the opportunity to integrate citizen science and vgi in this way is in the construction and validation of numerical flood inundation models of flood affected communities flood inundation modelling forms a cornerstone of flood risk assessment bates and de roo 2000 hunter et al 2007 lane et al 2011a parkes et al 2013 it informs almost all flood management activities from monitoring and warning systems nester et al 2016 to evacuation planning simonovic and ahmad 2005 and emergency response coles et al 2017 to the design and construction of future developments pappenberger et al 2007a however at present flood modelling is primarily an expert led activity with little or no citizen involvement lane et al 2011b the established approach to validating inundation model outputs is to match available historical data to simulated outputs pappenberger et al 2007a the goodness of fit between predicted and observed river levels can be assessed using statistical best fit techniques such as nash sutcliffe model efficiency nsme nash and sutcliffe 1970 or root mean square error rmse altenau et al 2017 similarly point in time global flood extents can also be assessed using binary performance measures such as the critical success index c which compares the extent of simulated inundation to the observed inundation wing et al 2017 what tests are undertaken is dependent upon data availability in channel river level data is a source of historical information commonly available in medium and large catchments hunter et al 2007 parkes et al 2013 to examine out of bank inundation high resolution aerial and satellite imagery renschler and wang 2017 multiband remote sensing such as landsat fern√°ndez et al 2016 jung et al 2014 or other sensors such as synthetic aperture radar garc√≠a pintado et al 2013 pappenberger et al 2007b wood et al 2016 can all be used studies have also demonstrated the usefulness of ground observations of wrack and water marks in reconstructing maximum inundation extents and levels neal et al 2009 parkes et al 2013 segura beltr√°n et al 2016 however collection of this latter form of flood inundation evidence typically requires post event surveys which are time and resource consuming and often yield spatially limited results segura beltr√°n et al 2016 the validation of model outputs is therefore constrained by data availability to being either spatially or temporally limited gauged river levels may record levels throughout an event but are limited to discrete locations whilst remote sensing can provide spatially extensive information on inundation but only at discrete time points consequently established statistical techniques for model validation have been unable to assess the effectiveness of models in simulating both spatial and temporal event dynamics hunter et al 2007 these dynamics include the pathways which water takes across the floodplain the flood timeline and local variation in flood impacts all of which are capable of being simulated in detail by current 2d inundation models teng et al 2017 this disparity between the complexity of current inundation models and the relative lack of data against which to test them represents an opportunity to integrate citizen collected data into existing expert led practices of knowledge creation thus far however there has been little exploration of this issue 3 methods in this research we build on the methodology used by smith et al 2012 by demonstrating how vgi data should be used more routinely for model validation as a dataset in its own right smith et al 2012 provide a demonstration of the use of a diverse vgi database to construct and validate a model of coastal flood defence overtopping they utilise vgi to build the model by using locally recorded locations of flood defence overtopping as point inflows into the model domain they also validate its outputs reconstructing the observed flood extents and depths at properties using historical photographs and media accounts however the approach demonstrated was limited by the data used which was confined to imagery and records of depth at specific locations by examining only modelled extent and depth the method provides a spatial but not a temporal validation the resultant model cannot examine the functioning of the model in simulating flood dynamics in more detail nor does the study explore how vgi could be used more comprehensively this is reflected in smith et al s conclusion that the data used represented useful corroborating evidence for the performance of the model p 43 after a more traditional validation using available measured data in this study we develop an experimental validation methodology which uses a wide range of data potentially available through vgi and participatory research approaches to examine different aspects of a simulation output to demonstrate the method we use a database of vgi to reconstruct in detail a severe flood in the northeast of england and use a vgi based flood reconstruction to validate the outputs of a 2d flood inundation model of the event finally we compare the outputs to more established methods of validation to demonstrate the success of the method 3 1 model build we utilised the flood inundation model lisflood fp to produce simulated flood event outputs for our case study lisflood fp is a 2d finite difference model developed specifically to utilise high resolution topographic data to simulate floodplain dynamics bates et al 2010 hunter et al 2005 neal et al 2012 2011 bates and de roo 2000 although we used lisflood fp here the validation approach developed should be considered generic and is designed to be applicable to any 2d model that predicts dynamic floodplain inundation the principle data requirements for the model are outlined in table 1 3 1 1 the case study the 2015 corbridge flood the test case used in this study is the market town of corbridge located in the tyne valley in the northeast of england fig 1 corbridge was chosen to develop and test the experimental validation because of its recent history of severe flooding and the way its population were already engaged with ongoing flood research rollason et al 2018 corbridge experienced extensive flooding when storm desmond resulted in record rainfall across areas of the north of england barker et al 2016 on 5th december 2015 the flood an event with a return period estimated to be between 100 and 200 years marsh et al 2016 overtopped the flood defences at corbridge and inundated 70 properties on the south side of the river tyne environment agency 2016 using lisflood fp a model of the river tyne was constructed extending for approximately 30 km with corbridge situated approximately half way down the modelled reach fig 1 shows the modelled reach and the main data used are discussed in table 1 to predict the december 2015 flood event the model was run for a 72 h period starting at 12 00 on friday 4th december continuing until 12 00 on monday 7th december this period covered both the rising and falling limbs of the main hydrograph at corbridge simulation results were generated for every 15 min period predicting flood depths flood velocity and time of inundation 3 2 validating the model outputs using established approaches initial verification and calibration of the model was undertaken during the model build the mesh resolution independence of the model was verified by testing against dem resolutions of 5 0 7 5 10 0 and 20 0 m hardy et al 1999 horritt and bates 2001 the model was further calibrated against floodplain friction values which were estimated from chow 1959 based on satellite imagery and field visits differential friction values were applied to the channel of the tyne and the main floodplain with the area of the channel delineated based on satellite imagery manning s values for floodplain friction between 0 02 and 0 06 m1 3 s 1 and channel friction values between 0 03 and 0 07 m1 3 s 1 were used in the model calibration runs validation of which was undertaken using established statistical approaches validation was also undertaken on the calibrated model as a baseline against which to test the effectiveness of the experimental methodology two datasets were available for the validation using established statistical techniques gauged river levels and observed flood extents for the estimated maximum extent gauged river levels were validated using both nash sutcliffe model efficiency nsme and root mean square error rmse altenau et al 2017 maximum flood extents were validated using the critical success index c wing et al 2017 wood et al 2016 sometimes referred to as the fit statistic sampson et al 2015 c tests the proportion of wet observed data that is replicated by the model on a per pixel basis accounting for both over and under prediction c m 1 o 1 m 1 o 1 m 0 o 1 m 1 o 0 where m is the modelled outcome and o is the observed outcome and 1 or 0 represents pixels that are either wet or dry c can range from 0 no match between simulated and observed inundation to 1 perfect match between simulated and observed inundation 3 3 developing a new solution for validating inundation models 3 3 1 the volunteered geographic information database participatory research in corbridge was undertaken with the community at to develop a vgi database of local knowledge and experiences of the december 2015 flooding event as part of wider participatory work being undertaken at corbridge see rollason et al 2018 we carried out two participatory mapping workshops with 10 research participants and five individual walking interviews after evans and jones 2011 discussions and interviews were un or semi structured in nature dowling et al 2016 with participants being encouraged to lead the discussion and discuss their own knowledge and experiences during the mapping workshops participants were encouraged to locate their knowledge on blank maps of the study area for example observed locations of defence overtopping or pathways of flood water flow walking interviews were also participant led following either the natural go along kusenbach 2003 or participatory walking interview clark and emmel 2008 models spatial data were recorded either directly into gis or onto paper maps for later digitisation verbal discussions were recorded and analysed by adopting a grounded theory approach charmaz 2011 combining both the audio recording and visual representations knigge and cope 2006 information provided in anecdotal accounts was triangulated with digital images and video taken during the event and collected during the participatory process the information were used to produce an extensive database of how the flood occurred table 2 most of the data was collected from the local community but it was augmented by non georeferenced footage from an unmanned aerial vehicle uav identified on news footage immediately after the event and collected by a local uav enthusiast 3 3 2 using the vgi database to reconstruct the dynamics of a severe flood during validation it is necessary to establish the main dynamics of the flooding event for which the model is being validated to do this we divided the vgi data into three information categories 1 pathways data which provided information on the movement of flood water through the study area including areas of overtopping and principle flow directions 2 impacts data which provided information on the maximum extent of the flooding 3 timeline data which provided information on the timing of key events during the flood including overtopping of defences arrival of flood water at key locations and inundation of properties mapped data and personal accounts anecdotal data were combined into a single vector layer within a gis with the anecdotal data included within the layer as specific or linked attribute data following the qualitative gis approaches of cope and elwood 2009 this layer was used to reconstruct a unified account of the event dynamics including times of overtopping and inundation of properties photographs and videos were georeferenced and quantitative information was extracted where possible for example the location of wrack or height of flood marks or the direction of gravel deposition showing flow pathways where quantitative data was not collected directly images were used simply for interpretation and to validate other data sources perks et al 2016 have demonstrated how georeferenced uav data can allow precise quantification of flood flows and flow vectors for an urban situation in scotland however the uav footage collected during the corbridge study was obtained opportunistically and as a result did not contain the necessary metadata or ground control point information to allow it to be georeferenced it was thus used in an analytical manner using darker surface colours or isolated water bodies to indicate previous areas of inundation renschler and wang 2017 in areas where no footage was available interpolation of the flood extent was undertaken based on expert judgement and using lidar topography 3 3 3 quality control of vgi data the vgi dataset collected for this study is fragmentary and format messy this makes the assessment of data quality using traditional quantitative measures difficult however it is still necessary to assess the extent to which we can have confidence in the data and the flood event reconstruction derived from it and to do this we adopted the approach of mays and pope 2000 this validation approach uses a researcher led reflexive approach relying on triangulation of different data sources to assess and validate individual pieces of information for example the comparison of anecdotal accounts with imagery or physical evidence on the ground this approach does not provide the quantifiable analysis of error normally required for model validation instead the method identifies areas of error and uncertainty spatial and temporal or contested knowledge which can arise due to the nature of the vgi data being used 3 3 4 the experimental framework for model validation the experimental validation brought together the flood event reconstruction derived from the vgi database with the outputs of the lisflood fp model which represent the dynamics of the event the outputs showed dynamic flood depths and flow vectors times of inundation and maximum flood extents flood depths and times of inundation were extracted directly from the model at user defined time steps in raster grid format as a velocity output the model produces grids representing the flow of water between grid cells in both the x and y directions to convert these velocity grids into flow vectors the saga gis tool gradient vectors from directional components conrad et al 2015 was used an average across 4 grid cells 40 m was used to reveal underlying flow directions which could be compared against the observed evidence fig 2 shows the experimental approach and the vgi datasets used to validate the different dynamics of the event 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of the model outputs using established methods table 3 shows that the model performed consistently well in simulating gauged water levels along the whole modelled reach with a floodplain manning s n of between 0 03 and 0 07 m1 3 s 1 and a dem resolution of either 10 or 20 m this dem resolution is in line with the recommendations of the uk environment agency fluvial design guide crower 2009 which suggests model resolutions of 25 m in rural areas and 10 m for urban areas it is also in line with other catchment or sub regional studies although there is significant variation in the resolutions used gobeyn et al 2017 neal et al 2011 renschler and wang 2017 savage et al 2016 wing et al 2017 some studies have demonstrated the use of very high resolution topographic information for example sampson et al 2012 but these are exclusively applied to small scale urban studies rather than the larger rural reaches such as that simulated in the current study table 3 also indicates the goodness of fit measured by the critical success index c between the simulated and observed maximum flood extents within the study area the results indicate that all of the tested parameter sets achieved greater than 85 success in matching the observed peak flood extents the calibrated model achieved a 90 success rate which compares very favourably with other modelling studies which achieved between 50 and 90 success rates renschler and wang 2017 wing et al 2017 at a local scale visual assessment of the simulated and observed extents fig 3 show that within the area of interest there was considerable variability in areas of over and underestimation in particular the model overestimated the extent of overtopping of the flood defences at dilston haugh fig 3 location a and at the rugby club fig 3 location b whilst it underestimated the extent of flooding on dilston haugh it is considered likely that the bare earth dem vegetation and buildings removed used in the model contained inaccuracies which influenced the flow of water across the floodplain which will be discussed further below 4 2 application of the experimental validation approach 4 2 1 reconstruction of the 2015 event dynamics fig 4 shows the reconstruction of the dynamics of the december 2015 flood undertaken using the vgi database these can be divided into two types of dynamics pathways of defence overtopping and pathways of flow across the floodplain the results indicated three pathways of defence overtopping fp1 fp3 and fp4 fp1 and fp3 represented generalised overtopping of the defences the extent of which is indicated on fig 4 whereas fp4 was identified as a specific location of overtopping at the junction between two defence types which resulted in a distinct flow of water onto the cricket club from the north two pathways of flow across the floodplain were also reconstructed fp2 represented a general flow from the upstream areas of overtopping following the topography of the floodplain fp5 represented backing up of water that was unable to return back to the river as a result of the flood defence and the high water levels in the river this was manifested in the data as a reported sudden increase in depth at properties between 19 00 and 20 00 gmt on 5th december two main areas of impact were also represented at the stanners fig 4 fi1 and station road fig 4 fi2 although the distribution of properties affected by the flooding event was greater than that shown no data was available to validate the impacts in these other areas 4 3 results of the experimental validation the calibrated model was validated against the key pathways timings and impacts of the december 2015 flood identified in section 4 2 4 3 1 validation of flood pathways pathways were identified from the model simulation using 15 min resolution time series outputs of depth and velocity fig 5 shows the results of the validation the results indicate that the model was successful in simulating all of the major pathways identified in the observed data in the case of fp1 and fp2 the model showed general overtopping of the defences along dilston haugh and flow following low lying areas of the floodplain topography which are potentially relict river channels this is further north on the floodplain than was interpreted from the vgi and is considered to reflect error within the vgi rather than in the model this is because these flow pathways were not directly observed by the research participants instead they were inferred from the direction of flood waters which entered their homes for fp3 and fp4 the model showed successful differentiation between the two pathways fp3 was simulated as overtopping of the wall at lion court and there is also a distinct overtopping location at fp4 this results in flow across the cricket club from the north reported by research participants which is separate to the other flooding at and around lion court the processes behind the time line of fp5 were the most contested within the vgi with participants reporting a sudden increase in depth at the stanners and station road fig 5 but with considerable disagreement over the pathway this water had taken review of the flow vectors produced by the model for this area was not conclusive in identifying a simple backflow of water however calculation of the change in simulated inundation depth at the stanners does show a significant increase in depth in the area which corresponds to the observed pattern and timing of flooding this suggests that the model is accurately simulating the observed flooding situation however whether or not the processes underlying this simulation are accurate cannot be validated with the available data 4 3 2 validation of flood timeline the success of the model at simulating the timings of the december 2015 flood was assessed based on the 15 min resolution time series animations produced by the model table 4 shows the simulated timeline against the observed timings and demonstrates that the model was successful at predicting the timings of pathways fp1 4 as it simulated the pathways in the observed order and either at the correct time or within the time periods identified by participants in simulating fp5 the model showed a significant increase in depth in these areas from 18 30 gmt onwards fig 5 where it showed a 30 min offset from the observed time however it is also possible this offset reflected variation in the timing of the effect observed by participants rather than any error in the model itself 4 3 3 validation of flood impacts section 3 has already outlined the partial validation of the flood extents of the 5th december 2015 flood event which demonstrated that the model achieved 90 global accuracy in simulating maximum flood extent and water levels however the simulation of local water levels and hence flood depth can also be assessed using quantitative data on flood levels derived from imagery obtained across the area of interest eighteen images were collected as part of the research that could be used for the validation of these 12 were capable of being used for validation of flood impacts with 4 located along the dilston haugh flood defence two each at the stanners and station road and three at the cricket club fig 5 providing coverage of the majority of the study area eight of these images provided information on the maximum flooded depth and could be used to quantify the variation in observed and simulated depths four images did not provide any direct information on maximum depths but provided a minimum constraint to simulated maximum depths as they showed inundation depths on sunday 6th december on the waning limb of the flood hydrograph table 5 shows that there was variable success in the simulation of local flood depths along the flood embankment at dilston haugh table 5 photographs 1 5 the model consistently underestimated flood depths overtopping the flood embankment by an average of 0 25 m and up to a maximum of 0 50 m at the stanners and the cricket club table 5 photographs 8 9 and 12 the model was more successful with the difference between interpreted and simulated depths of only 0 02 m and 0 16 m respectively for those images which provided only a minimum constraint to the simulated depths the modelled depth exceeded the minimum constraint in all cases these results suggest that there were disparities in the way that the model simulated the flow of water into and or out of the study area the underestimation of depths along the dilston haugh defences suggested that this pathway was not correctly simulated with too little flood water overtopping the defences at this location that local flood depths at the stanners and the cricket club were more accurate suggesting that overtopping at this location might be too great these results were substantiated by the maximum extent results fig 3 which showed overtopping of the embankments at the rugby club something not reported in the vgi database taken together these results demonstrated that at a local scale simulation of inundation depths and extents was quite variable this was despite the model showing high levels of accuracy at a global scale these results likely reflect inaccuracies in the bare earth dem which influenced simulated flow at a local scale these inaccuracies could potentially have been introduced either during the pre processing filtering process or during the resampling of the data from 2 m to 10 m resolution 5 discussion this paper has introduced a new approach to flood model validation the approach uses a vgi database collected during and immediately after a severe flood event to reconstruct and validate event dynamics this approach builds on traditional statistical approaches which are typically spatially or temporally limited and do not give a full picture of how an inundation model is performing at a local scale the approach has been tested using a vgi database collected following a severe flood which occurred at corbridge uk in december 2015 5 1 evaluating the success of the experimental validation method the results of the research demonstrate that the experimental approach offers a more comprehensive validation of event dynamics than offered by traditional statistical approaches at a global scale established quantitative validation methods were used to assess the goodness of fit between simulated and observed water levels at river gauges and between observed and simulated maximum flooded extents the simulation shows rmse values of 0 5 and nse values of 0 9 at all available gauges and a 90 accuracy in simulating the observed maximum extents this is equal to or better than other similar modelling studies using lisflood fp renschler and wang 2017 wing et al 2017 and suggests that the model is successfully simulating the inundation seen during the december 2015 flood event however these established metrics only provide an incomplete spatially and temporally limited validation of the model performance hunter et al 2007 the results of the experimental method outlined indicate that the more comprehensive validation is able to identify areas of model under performance not identified by established global statistical approaches in particular the experimental validation shows that although the model accurately simulates the timeline and locations of flood pathways it incorrectly simulates the processes of overtopping and consequently local inundation depths these results likely reflect localised inaccuracies in the underlying 10 m resolution dem used for the model or the need for greater spatial variability in the parameterisation of roughness both which could influence the flow of water across the floodplain which is not identified at a global scale this would have potentially serious consequences if the model was to be used for local emergency response planning or informing for example population evacuation strategies simonovic and ahmad 2005 5 2 vgi data as an alternative to established data sources fig 6 categorises the data used in the study according to its qualitative quantitative nature and its degree of certainty in comparison to more established data sources fig 6 shows how the vgi data is set apart from traditional data in its range of sources and how it comprises a blend of quantitative semi quantitative and qualitative data the study demonstrates that this range of data sources makes it possible to understand and reconstruct flood event dynamics using the vgi data as a standalone dataset as shown through the validation of the flood timeline and local scale pathways and impacts presented here vgi data offers opportunities for validating aspects of the flood inundation models at spatial and temporal scales which would be almost impossible using traditional means this makes vgi a valuable alternative to traditional data sources not just for immediate post disaster response and recovery haworth and bruce 2015 but also as a longer term source of data to inform scientific analysis granell and ostermann 2016 this range of data sources has also been shown to be important to achieving a valid vgi dataset particularly where a mixture of qualitative quantitative data prevents the application of statistical metrics previous studies using more single format databases have highlighted data validity as a limitation of vgi data e g klonner et al 2016 however we have demonstrated the usefulness of adopting a much more flexible and interpretative model of data assessment based on triangulation with different data sources mays and pope 2000 sousa 2014 wiggins and he 2016 5 3 a new framework for validating flood inundation models this study has demonstrated a new approach to the validation of flood inundation models with the aim being simulation of underlying event dynamics through better incorporation of vgi the study has also demonstrated the usefulness of community generated vgi data as a primary input to the future validation of flood models building on these findings we suggest a new framework for the validation of flood models fig 7 the proposed framework builds on current statistical approaches to validation by recognising the ability of current numerical models to simulate complex event dynamics and the wider diversity of data which this study has shown to be applicable to model validation the framework represents a three stage process 5 3 1 data processing the framework encourages a flexible and researcher driven approach to assessing data validity which should reflect the data collected in its methods and outcome as the fields of citizen science and vgi continue to evolve and mature new practices of data collection and quality assessment will no doubt emerge granell and ostermann 2016 hung et al 2016 greater standardisation through structures such as citizen observatories represent one way in which data collection might be expanded and improved lanfranchi et al 2014 wehn et al 2015 future improvements in personal technology will also likely make uav data perks et al 2016 smith 2015 and geo located citizen data from personal electronic devices newman et al 2012 tang et al 2017 more widely available taking these potential future developments into account the framework aims to encourage the use of a wide range of data in many formats to allow cross referencing and triangulation between data sources 5 3 2 event dynamics the framework proposes pathways timeline and impacts as broad categories through which principle event dynamics can be defined this includes the traditionally assessed metrics of in channel gauged levels and maximum inundation extents but recognises that for many uses the parameterisation of numerical models in terms of these metrics alone is overly simplistic by assessing a wider range of processes within the framework we can develop a more holistic validation and ensure that the dynamic simulation capabilities of modern numeric models are exploited to their full potential 5 3 3 validation methods the framework adopts the same flexible approach to the validation of simulated dynamics as to data assessment this recognises that different input data simulations and dynamics require different approaches to validation three broad types are proposed statistical incorporating established performance measures wing et al 2017 analytical reflecting semi quantitative approaches such as the analysis of uav footage and quantitative imagery demonstrated by this study and visual encompassing all techniques which rely on on the face of it validation rykiel 1996 the latter would include the assessment of pathways against the dynamic simulation outputs demonstrated in this study the balance of validation techniques should reflect both the availability of simulation outputs and the availability of suitable data against which to validate them the final validation produced by the framework is a flexible one influenced by the dynamics of the event the data available and methods adopted the final result will likely lack the quantitative rigour of established statistical methods based on the results of this study we propose that some degree of inaccuracy and uncertainty can be accepted in return for the benefit of achieving a more comprehensive understanding of complex flood event dynamics granell and ostermann 2016 by adopting a more flexible approach to using vgi data in this way we can improve model validation and furthermore open up the currently expert led practices of flood risk assessment to greater public participation us√≥n et al 2016 6 conclusions numerical models are the foundation of flood risk assessment and management used for understanding and mapping areas at risk from floods and planning management interventions recent improvements in computing power and model code and increases in the availability of spatially distributed data on floodplain environments have increased the popularity of 2d models for providing detailed simulations of complex flood dynamics however improvements in model simulations have not been accompanied by corresponding improvements in model validation due to a lack of data from during and immediately after flooding events validation of flood inundation models still grounded in the statistical assessment of spatially and temporally limited datasets such as remotely sensed flood extents or in channel river gauging the research presented in this study has demonstrated a new approach to the validation of flood inundation models using vgi data to provide information on event dynamics not captured by traditionally measured datasets in so doing we have demonstrated that 1 by collecting a wide range of vgi data from multiple sources it is possible to reconstruct in detail the dynamics of a severe flood although statistical validation is less rigorous the quality of this reconstruction can be assessed through data triangulation and other qualitative approaches 2 the reconstruction of flood pathways timeline and impacts of flooding can be used to validate the dynamic outputs of a 2d flood inundation model and allow both spatial and temporal examination of model performance in simulating flooding processes 3 the experimental model validation approach tested here enhances existing global statistical approaches to validation by examining the simulation of underlying flood processes using the case study of a large flood on the river tyne uk the results of the test case indicate that a model assessed using traditional methods as having a global accuracy of over 90 in simulating gauged river levels and maximum flood extent does not accurately represent the actual pathways and impacts of the event this is potentially highly significant when models are used in a dynamic way to plan and assess floodplain management interventions drawing on these conclusions we propose a new flexible framework for the validation of flood inundation models in contrast to current approaches the framework encourages the use of a diverse range of non traditional data now and into the future similarly the framework encourages a mixture of approaches to validation to be adopted leading to more flexibility depending on data availability and aspects of the simulation being considered although the final validation may lack the quantitative rigour of established global approaches it provides a more comprehensive and bespoke examination of the model s performance particularly for situations where dynamic model outputs are being used to inform potential floodplain interventions the results shown by this study also demonstrate the value of alternative data sources such as vgi or data collected from citizen science programmes to enhance and extend established data sources we have demonstrated that many of the common criticisms of alternative data being messy and unscientific can be understood or overcome by relatively simple procedures for quality control such as triangulation however data is as demonstrated by other studies not always as diverse or spatially distributed as that collected in this study a fact that must be considered when translating this approach to other areas for triangulation to be effective a mixture of overlapping data from different informants and from different sources e g anecdotal remote sensing imagery is essential additionally all of these data need to be located both spatially and temporally within the study area or event of interest this necessitates further research on the development of data collection approaches which combine the locally situated engagement adopted in this study with structured data collection approaches of citizen science or citizen observatories and the spatial coverage of technology based vgi approaches with predicted increases in the risk of flooding as a result of future climate change numerical models are likely to continue to represent a significant asset in flood risk assessment practices the vgi framework proposed here represents a more comprehensive process of model validation based on the more effective use of alternative data sources this has the benefit of both allowing more comprehensive exploitation of modern numerical modelling to better simulate complex river floodplain interactions and also encouraging the exploration and use of diverse datasets which may open up new perspectives on the use of numerical models for the creation flood risk knowledge to effectively integrate the proposed validation framework into future modelling work further research is urgently required in order to explore how technological vgi solutions could be developed to allow the routine collection of flood data through local engagement platforms such as citizen observatories 7 declarations of

7222,a new simple and robust solution based on uniform steady state flow velocity is developed for the problem of solute transport in a fracture matrix system with a finite penetration depth of a radioactive contaminant into the rock matrix the solution is an extension of liu et al 2017 to finite penetration depth and an alternative solution strategy to the problem solved by sudicky et al 1982 the solution takes the form of a convolution of two functions the first function describes the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute resulting merely from advection and fickian dispersion the second function is actually the impulse response of the fracture matrix system in the case of a plug flow without any hydrodynamic dispersion as a result the effects of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport are decoupled and thus the resulting breakthrough curve can be analyzed in terms of those two functions in addition to this the derived p√©clet numbers of those two functions based on temporal moments are also found to be associated with the derived p√©clet number of the resulting breakthrough curve by comparing the p√©clet numbers of those two functions the contribution of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion to solute spreading is determined in a straightforward way this can aid to find out the dominating mechanism on solute transport and therefore the performance of breakthrough curve can be approximated by only one function in some specific cases keywords fractured rocks solute transport model matrix diffusion dispersion p√©clet number temporal moment analysis 1 introduction to aid safety and performance assessment of deep geological repositories for spent nuclear fuel numerous computation tools have been developed over the years berkowitz 2002 based on either continuum porous medium model e g long et al 1982 marsic et al 2001 discrete fracture network model e g dershowitz et al 1998 or channel network model e g gylling et al 1999 shahkarami et al 2016 the general aim of those models is to address the problem of water flow and solute transport in fractured crystalline rocks under circumstances of a repository however to simplify the problem they conceptualize the crystalline rocks as a network of fractures long et al 1982 dershowitz et al 1998 gylling et al 1999 for this reason those models often take the single fracture matrix system as a representative volume element of the network neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 hodgkinson and maul 1988 even though the models may make use of different numerical methods in solving the governing equations of solute transport in a single fracture matrix system they all consider fractures or channels as highly effective pathways for solute transport as compared to the host rock as a result they commonly apply the advection dispersion equation berkowitz 2002 to describe advective transport and hydrodynamic dispersion of solutes and fick s second law to account for the influence of diffusion into the rock matrix and linear sorption on retarding solutes neretnieks 1980 moreno et al 1985 these two equations of continuity coupled by mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface can conveniently be solved by finite difference or finite element methods grisak and pickens 1980 barker 1982 hodgkinson and maul 1988 to give evolutions of the solute concentration in both the fracture and the rock matrix however the effects of numerical dispersion are difficult to assess tang et al 1981 by comparison analytical solutions neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 not only help to speed up the calculation of the breakthrough curves over a single fracture but also make it easier to implement into the case of large field scales consisting of an arbitrary number of rock units with piecewise constant geological properties hodgkinson and maul 1988 mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 it is mainly for these reasons that many efforts have been made in the 1980s to develop either time or laplace domain analytical solutions for solute transport in a single fracture matrix system under different conditions in particular neretnieks 1980 presented an analytical solution for solute transport in a single fracture under the assumption that dispersion and diffusion along the fracture are negligible tang et al 1981 established a general transient solution for the same problem but accounted for fickian dispersion based on this work sudicky and frind 1982 derived the analytical solution for a system of parallel fractures hodgkinson and maul 1988 considered additionally that only a portion of the rock is available for matrix diffusion and derived an analytical laplace transformed solution for an arbitrary length decay chain these analytical solutions were indeed important contributions to advance our knowledge of solute transport in fractured porous rocks and paved the way for further development of models that take into account heterogeneity in either fracture e g including stagnant water zones in the conceptual model mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 shahkarami et al 2015 or matrix diffusion zhang et al 2006 mahmoudzadeh et al 2016 however analytical solutions in the time domain are commonly intricate and tedious tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 making it difficult to give an intuitive understanding of the interactions between dispersive and diffusive processes analytical solutions in the laplace domain generally limited to steady state flow velocity are often concise and easy to manage neretnieks 1980 liu et al 2017 but still cannot give a clear insight into the real phenomena in the fracture matrix system only very recently liu et al 2017 have found that the analytical solution to the problem studied by tang et al 1981 can actually be treated as the convolution of two functions the first function describes the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute in the fracture only system as if the rock matrix is impermeable the second function is the response of the fracture matrix system to the input source when hydrodynamic dispersion has been completely neglected given a solute advection time as a result the effects of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport have been decoupled in the sense that one may consider these two transport mechanisms separately and independently this understanding allows us to extend the analytical solution and physical interpretations into more general cases such as the one studied by hodgkinson and maul 1988 noticeably the derived analytical solution in liu et al 2017 is based on the assumption of semi infinite rock matrix in which the solute cannot encounter the far boundary and the results will not be impacted both by the distance to the boundary and the type of boundary condition imposed however to ensure more conservative long term predictions of solute transport it is preferable to have a finite extent of matrix in the assumption i e the depth available for the solute to penetrate into the rock matrix is limited liu et al 2006 skb 2006a 2006b sudicky and frind 1982 derived an analytical solution to this problem however their solution is apt to diverge when evaluated in addition to this difficulty with the numerical implementation that solution cannot give a clear understanding of the roles of matrix diffusion and fickian dispersion in influencing solute transport not to mention that we apply the solution to analyze observed breakthrough curves for these reasons we developed a new transient solution for the problem of solute transport in a fracture matrix system with a finite penetration depth of a radioactive contaminant this new analytical solution shows its superiority in stability of numerical implementation over the solution derived in sudicky and frind 1982 additionally it is also a convolution of two functions similar to the analytical solution derived in liu et al 2017 the effects of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport are still decoupled due to this decoupling the influence of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on the spreading of resulting breakthrough curves can be determined in terms of two corresponding p√©clet numbers the derivation of which is based on temporal moments as a consequence the connection between the analytical solution and the resulting breakthrough curves becomes apparent this readily shows which mechanism dominates the dispersion in this contribution we will first revisit the model of sudicky and frind 1982 in section 2 and then develop in section 3 a general transient solution for the problem of solute transport along a single fracture with a finite extent of matrix the focus is however put in section 4 on temporal moment analysis of the functions involved in the solution and on characterization of the breakthrough curves the objective is to evaluate the relative importance of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on spreading the solute mass through the fracture matrix system in section 5 some simulations are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the solution that is evaluated using adaptive gauss kronrod quadrature kronrod 1965 concluding remarks are given in section 6 2 mathematical model as schematically shown in fig 1 we consider the same fracture matrix system as that studied by sudicky and frind 1982 which consists of a set of identical fractures whose planes are parallel and equally spaced each of the fractures is represented by two smooth parallel plates with a constant aperture 2b embedded in a homogeneous porous rock the groundwater velocity is assumed to be constant and a tracer pulse is injected over a certain period of time at the origin of each fracture because the fracture matrix geometry repeats itself and because each fracture is symmetrical we only need to consider one half of a fracture and one half of the intervening porous matrix based on the same assumptions and simplifications of sudicky and frind 1982 the transport processes in the fracture matrix system can be described by two coupled one dimensional equations along with the initial and boundary conditions for the sake of completeness we rewrite the equations of continuity as 1 r f c f t u c f x d f 2 c f x 2 d p Œµ p 1 b c p z z 0 r f Œª c f and 2 r p c p t d p 2 c p z 2 r p Œª c p where the subscripts f and p refer to the fracture and the pore space of the rock matrix respectively x l and z l are the coordinates along and perpendicular to the fracture plane respectively t t denotes the time c ml 3 represents the concentration of the tracer r is the retardation coefficient d l 2 t 1 stands for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the fracture or the pore diffusion coefficient in the homogeneous rock matrix u lt 1 is the groundwater velocity in the fracture Œµ denotes the matrix porosity and Œª t 1 is the decay constant equation 1 describes the advection dispersion of a decaying solute in the fracture coupled with mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface and it is subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 3 c f x 0 0 4 c f 0 t c in t 5 c f t 0 where c in ml 3 describes the concentration of the tracer at the origin of the fracture as a function of time equation 2 describes the transport process of the solute in the rock matrix and it is subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 6 c p x z 0 0 7 c p x 0 t c f x t 8 c p z x d t 0 where d l denotes a distance from the fracture surface into the rock matrix up to which matrix diffusion is assumed to take place this distance can be regarded as being due to a symmetry boundary condition between parallel fractures separated by 2 d or else being the length scale for limited matrix diffusion although the general transient solution of the coupled system of equations has been obtained by sudicky and frind 1982 several decades ago its application for practical use is largely limited the reason is due mainly to the involvement of two integrals each of which has an infinite upper limit this significantly increases the computational burden when evaluated numerically for each point in space and time one can as suggested by sudicky and frind 1982 first scan the integrand prior to integration to determine its range and then locate the integration points within that range to solve the problem this may however make the numerical evaluation less efficient and apt to diverge in the results especially in the cases involving low water velocities or large dispersion coefficients to overcome these shortcomings we may apply the same strategy as that adopted by liu et al 2017 for obtaining the general transient solution for the problem of nuclide transport along a single fracture in a porous rock with d for simplicity however we will not account for radioactive decay in this study i e setting Œª 0 because the inclusion of this mechanism into the model or into the solution is trivial liu et al 2017 and also because our main interest is to explore the combined effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and matrix diffusion in retarding solute transport on the other hand it is noticed that the mode of tracer injection at the origin of the fracture can always be written as 9 c in t 0 c in Œæ Œ¥ t Œæ d Œæ where Œ¥ t is the dirac delta t 1 function the linearity and time invariance of eqs 1 and 2 together with the form of eq 9 make that the response to c in t injection i e the breakthrough curve takes the form of a convolution integral i e 10 c f t 1 m 0 0 c in t Œæ c f Œæ Œ¥ d Œæ where we have defined m 0 mtl 3 as the zeroth moment of the concentration history haggerty 1999 and the subscript Œ¥ refers to the case of a pulse or dirac injection defined as liu et al 2017 11 c in t Œ¥ m 0 Œ¥ t this suggests that we only need to address the impulse response c f t Œ¥ in the first place once it is known the solution to c f t in general cases can readily be obtained from eq 10 more importantly eq 10 implies that the impulse response c f t Œ¥ serves actually as the kernel of the solution to c f t and consequently it would determine the nature of the breakthrough curves in all other cases for this reason we will focus in this study only on discussion of the case of a pulse injection because the impulse response would exhibit more details and fine features than the solution to c f t in other cases as it resembles to a great extent the probability density function rather than the cumulative distribution function of the skewed normal distribution for this reason some necessary properties e g the peak point and the standard deviation can be provided by the probability density function in a straightforward way to simplify the notation we will omit the subscript Œ¥ in what follows 3 general transient solution a solution in time space is derived by the use of laplace transform method by applying the laplace transform to the system of governing equations along with the initial and boundary conditions it can be justified that the solution to c f in the laplace domain in the case of a pulse injection can be written as sudicky and frind 1982 12 c f m 0 exp pe 2 exp pe 2 1 4 pe t w tanh t p r p s g s r f s where c f mtl 3 denotes the laplace transformation of c f and s t 1 is the laplace variable t w t is the mean water residence time in the fracture t w x u t p t is the characteristic diffusion time in the rock matrix t p d 2 d p pe is the p√©clet number pe ux d f d f is the dispersion coefficient which must be fickian i e it behaves in the same way as a constant diffusion coefficient in writing this equation the g t 1 2 parameter as previously introduced by mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 2016 and liu et al 2017 has been defined as 13 g Œµ p r p d p b it follows from eq 12 that in the limiting case as pe we have 14 c f t w t p pe m 0 exp t w tanh t p r p s g s r f s where the arguments of c f are designed to emphasize the fact that it is both t w and t p dependent the inverse transform for c f t w t p pe is not straightforward but following the approach of sudicky and frind 1982 it can as presented in appendix a be written as 15 c f t t w t p pe g t r f t w t p h t r f t w where the arguments of the g ml 3 function imply that it depends partly on t r f t w and partly on t p h t is the heaviside step function with this result we may apply the same approach of liu et al 2017 to work on eq 12 leading to 16 c f 0 f œÑ c f œÑ t p pe d œÑ where the f t 1 function is defined as 17 f œÑ 1 2 œÄ 1 œÑ pe t w œÑ exp pe 4 t w œÑ œÑ t w 2 consequently the inverse transform for c f gives 18 c f t 0 f œÑ c f t œÑ t p pe d œÑ when use of eq 15 is made we find 19 c f t 0 t r f f œÑ g t r f œÑ t p d œÑ not surprisingly this result is exactly the same as that obtained by liu et al 2017 for a similar but simple case where d as discussed in what follows both f and g functions are special solutions to c f t liu et al 2017 and their use in eq 19 allows us to consider the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport separately and independently 4 characteristics of the breakthrough curves to facilitate understanding the behavior of solute transport in the fracture matrix system studied we perform temporal moment analysis for the f and g functions and also for the c f function because they all are impulse responses albeit under different conditions liu et al 2017 as is well known the first normalized temporal moment Œº represents the mean breakthrough time i e the time when half of the injected mass has passed through the observation location the second normalized temporal moment œÉ 2 denotes the degree of mixing of the solute mass within the specific system renu and suresh kumar 2014 more importantly Œº and œÉ 2 may be used together to characterize the resistance of the system to spread or deviation of the solute about the center of mass by way of a p√©clet number levenspiel 1999 defined as 20 pe s 2 Œº 2 œÉ 2 the larger the value of pe s is the less is the spreading of the breakthrough curve however temporal moments are usually difficult to determine directly from the analytical solutions in the time domain in such cases one may work instead in the laplace domain and make use of the identity aris 1958 21 m i t lim s 0 1 i c d i c ds i to evaluate the ith order of the normalized temporal moment for the breakthrough curve c x t of interest following this discussion we now turn to a detailed analysis of the f g and c f functions with a focus on understanding of their distinct physical meanings 4 1 analysis of the f function the f function as given in eq 17 can also be written in the form 22 f œÑ 1 2 œÄ d f œÑ x œÑ exp x u œÑ 2 4 d f œÑ as discussed by liu et al 2017 the f function depends only on u and d f at a given point of observation downstream the fracture and m 0 f œÑ is nothing but the impulse response of the fracture matrix system in the special case involving no surface sorption r f 1 and no matrix diffusion d p 0 for this reason œÑ in eq 22 should be understood as the solute residence time in the fracture only system or equivalently the solute advection time in the fracture matrix system the f function describes then the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute resulting merely from advection and fickian dispersion liu et al 2017 which is generally not normal as commonly assumed in dealing with velocity dispersion soler et al 2017 however if one defines 23 Œº f œÑ 2 t w and 24 œÉ f 2 2 œÑ 3 pe t w the f function may look in appearance like the normal distribution to give 25 f œÑ 1 2 œÄ œÉ f exp œÑ Œº f 2 2 œÉ f 2 eq 25 is actually the origin of approximating f œÑ as a normal distribution however it is not because both Œº f and œÉ f 2 are functions of œÑ which is the independent variable the real mean and variance of the solute advection time can nevertheless be determined from eq 22 and they are given respectively by 26 Œº f t w and 27 œÉ f 2 2 pe t w 2 this essentially suggests that the f function behaves differently i e it would spread out over a wider range of the solute advection time as t w increases or pe decreases whereas the mean of the solute advection time is always located at t w to verify if this is the case and also to illustrate the difference between f œÑ and the normal distribution n Œº f œÉ f 2 we show in fig 2 the normalized f œÑ i e t w f œÑ as a function of normalized time i e œÑ t w for different values of pe it is seen that the normalized f function does not resemble the shape of a bell at all in small pe cases only when pe has been increased to be large enough such as pe 500 would the difference between f œÑ and the normal distribution n Œº f œÉ f 2 become marginal additionally the results in fig 2 indicate that the larger the value of pe is the less spreading the solute advection time becomes this is however not surprising because the degree of spreading of any impulse response is known to be closely related to its mean and variance and it can be justified via eq 20 that the p√©clet number pe s of the solute advection time becomes 28 pe f pe where the subscript f in place of s emphasizes the fact that it is for the impulse response defined by the m 0 f œÑ function clearly pe s is now equivalent to pe this happens to hold however only in the case when solute dispersion is caused solely by hydrodynamic dispersion in more general cases of solute transport pe s as defined in eq 20 and pe would be different because pe s measures practically the degree of spreading of the breakthrough curve whereas pe gives an indication of the relative importance of advection and fickian dispersion in mass transport furthermore it should be stressed that the f function given in eq 17 or 22 has been developed under the conceptualization that the fracture has a constant aperture 2 b and is fully conductive for water flow with a constant velocity u liu et al 2017 this idealization allows us to evaluate the dispersion coefficient d f by taylor dispersion theory taylor 1953 bird et al 2002 that accounts for the effect of diffusion across the aperture of the fracture to give 29 d f d w u 2 b 2 52 5 d w where d w l 2 t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute in water the dispersion due to diffusion across the aperture of the fracture is however often very small and can be neglected compared to that across the width of the fracture with a variable aperture as discussed by liu et al 2017 the diffusion between streamlines at different locations over the width of a fracture or a channel perpendicular to the flow direction would be more important than that across the aperture because the flow channels are usually much wider than their apertures and for a channel with rhomboidal or wave shaped cross section we can generally write 30 d f d w u 2 w 2 c d d w where w l is the half width of the flow channel and c d 48 and 77 9 for the rhomboidal and wave shaped channels respectively with this modification of d f the f function given in eq 17 or 22 would still be applicable for tapered channels in more general cases in fractured crystalline rocks channel widths have been found to range from cm up to many tens of cm tsang and neretnieks 1998 in the wider channels where the flow is creeping the dispersion coefficient can become many orders of magnitude larger than the diffusion coefficient and lead to considerable dispersion it should be remembered that taylor dispersion takes some time to develop in the fluid in the tapered channel and that conditions for fickian dispersion to be valid may not be fulfilled for early times liu et al 2017 4 2 analysis of the g function the g function in eq 19 is the analytical solution to c f t in the limiting case as pe at time t r f œÑ given a solute advection time œÑ the distribution of which is determined by the f function it is actually the impulse response of the fracture matrix system in the case of a plug flow without any hydrodynamic dispersion i e d f 0 liu et al 2017 as detailed in appendix a the g function can be explicitly given by when t w has been replaced by œÑ in eq a7 31 g t r f œÑ t p m 0 œÄ r p t p 0 Œ∑ exp Œ∑ r cos Œ∑ i d Œ∑ with 32 Œ∑ r Œ∑ 2 œï œÑ t p sinh Œ∑ sin Œ∑ cosh Œ∑ cos Œ∑ and 33 Œ∑ i Œ∑ 2 2 t r f œÑ r p t p Œ∑ 2 œï œÑ t p sinh Œ∑ sin Œ∑ cosh Œ∑ cos Œ∑ where œï is the ratio between the pore volume in the rock matrix and the spatial volume of the fracture and it has been defined in eq a10 the form of an integral with an infinite upper limit in eq 31 often makes the numerical implementation of the g function less accurate one can as mentioned before apply the approach of sudicky and frind 1982 to circumvent of the problem but it often increases the computational burden considerably for this reason a different but simple strategy has been adopted in this study as discussed in detail in appendix c moreover the integral form of the g function also makes it difficult to obtain an analytical solutions to the mean Œº g and variance œÉ g 2 of the solute residence time t given œÑ and t p to address this issue we may first replace t w by œÑ in eq 14 to obtain the laplace solution of g t r f œÑ t p and then use eq 21 to evaluate its first and second normalized moments the results lead to 34 Œº g œÑ r f r p œï and 35 œÉ g 2 2 3 r p 2 œï œÑ t p it follows from the definition given in eq 20 that the p√©clet number of the g function can be written as 36 pe g 3 œï œÑ t p 1 r f r p 1 œï 2 this analysis suggests essentially that the g function when plotted as a function of t would become broader and broader as the product œï œÑ t p increases whereas the mean of the solute residence time deviates from the solute advection time œÑ by a factor of r f r p œï to verify if this is the case and also to illustrate the general properties of the g function we show in fig 3 the normalized g t r f œÑ t p i e g t r f œÑ t p œï œÑ m 0 as a function of the normalized time i e t r f œÑ r p œï œÑ for different values of Œ∫ œï œÑ t p it is seen that on one hand the mean of the normalized time is always located at unity consistently with the description of Œº g given in eq 34 on the other hand the greater the Œ∫ value is the less spreading the distribution of the solute residence time would be this is exactly what one may expect from the p√©clet number pe g defined in eq 36 Œ∫ can be understood as the ratio between the mass transfer rate into the rock matrix by diffusion and the mass transfer rate through the fracture by advection an increase in Œ∫ is equivalent to a decrease of d assuming that other parameters do not change which leads to an increase of the diffusive flux making the rock matrix quickly saturated as a result the effect of matrix diffusion on solute transport becomes marginal as shown in fig 3 in the case of Œ∫ 50 the normalized g function does not change much and it tends to approach the normal function obtained in the limiting case as d 0 see appendix b 2 one may therefore ignore the contribution of the rock matrix on solute transport as if it does not exist in the case of Œ∫ 10 4 the normalized g function also does not change much and it keeps parallel to the straight line obtained in the limiting case as d see appendix b 1 which gives a slope of 3 2 haggerty 1999 for this reason one may consider the rock matrix with Œ∫ 10 4 as if it has an infinite penetration depth in other cases the influence of Œ∫ on the normalized g function cannot be neglected because it gradually turns from a bell shape to a straight line as Œ∫ decreases or the penetration depth d increases this suggests that given a solute advection time œÑ the ratio between œï and t p would play a dominant role in determining the behavior of the g function it should however be noted that the definition of œï given in eq a10 is valid only for the idealized case where the fracture is considered to have a constant aperture 2 b for tapered channels it should be written as 37 œï v p v f where v p l 3 and v f l 3 are the pore volume of the rock matrix and the spatial volume of the fracture respectively with this description of œï the g function given in eq 31 would also hold in more general cases where the use of eq 2 is still acceptable for the description of solute transport in the rock matrix 4 3 analysis of the c f function as given in eq 19 the c f function or the breakthrough curve obtained at a given point of observation downstream is seemingly the convolution of the f and g functions it is then expected that the behavior of the breakthrough curve would generally be determined by both f and g functions in a complex way in some special cases however either f or g function will dominate as discussed below 4 3 1 the early time behavior at early time when t r f t w i e when the input pulse has advected just a short distance past the point of observation matrix diffusion might only have little effects in affecting the mixing of solute mass within the fracture the consequence is that the breakthrough curve would look nearly identical to that obtained in the limiting case as d 0 or equivalently œï 0 especially in the case of t p t w since in the limiting case as d 0 see appendix b 2 for detail 38 g t r f œÑ t p m 0 Œ¥ t r f œÑ the c f concentration from eq 19 would become 39 c f t m 0 f t r f this analysis suggests that the early time concentration in the fracture could roughly be described by eq 39 but only in the cases when œï is very small to illustrate this we compare in fig 4 different breakthrough curves obtained in case a as defined in table 1 at different œï values for a non sorbing solute it is seen that only when œï 0 1 or generally when r p œï 0 1 r f one may ignore the influence of matrix diffusion on the early time behavior of the breakthrough curves this indicates that given a typical value of b 0 05 mm and Œµ p 0 006 matrix diffusion would always make the early time breakthrough curves deviate considerably from that of a fracture only system as long as d 0 8 mm 4 3 2 the late time behavior at late time when t r f t w i e when the input pulse has advected far past the point of observation fickian dispersion will have a negligible effect on the c f concentration haggerty 1999 the breakthrough curve would then become nearly the same as that obtained in the limiting case as d f 0 or equivalently pe especially in the case of t p t w because in the limiting case as pe by following the discussions in section 4 1 40 f œÑ Œ¥ œÑ t w the c f concentration given in eq 17 reduces to 41 c f t g t r f t w t p which is the g t r f œÑ t p function evaluated at œÑ t w as a result the mean and variance of the breakthrough curve can directly be obtained from eqs 34 and 35 respectively to give 42 Œº m t w r f r p œï and 43 œÉ m 2 2 3 r p 2 œï t w t p consequently the p√©clet number of the breakthrough curve can be written from eq 36 as 44 pe m 3 œï t w t p 1 r f r p 1 œï 2 or approximately 3 Œ∫ evaluated at œÑ t w since r p œï r f often holds i e 45 pe m 3 œï t w t p this analysis suggests that the late time concentration in the fracture would gradually be dominated by the g function as pe increases only in the case when pe has become sufficiently large compared to pe m can one safely ignore the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion on the late time behavior of the breakthrough curves to illustrate this we compare in fig 5 different breakthrough curves obtained in case b as defined in table 1 at different pe values for a weakly sorbing solute clearly the discrepancy between the late time part of the breakthrough curves and the g t r f t w t p function has become marginal when pe 30 in fig 5 a and pe 300 in fig 5 b since the cases of fig 5 a and b correspond to pe m 3 and 30 respectively one may expect that the effect of fickian dispersion would become unimportant in spreading solute mass at late time when t r f t w provided that pe 10 pe m as a matter of fact the ratio between pe and pe m can as discussed below be taken as a criteria to evaluate the relative importance of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion 4 3 3 the statistical properties the c f function as given in eq 19 can also be regarded as the mean of the g functions the probability distribution of which is defined by the f function in terms of the solute advection time it is therefore a modified version of the g function obtained in the case of œÑ t w i e g t r f t w t p implying that the behavior of the breakthrough curve or the solute residence time distribution would always deviate somehow from that of the g t r f t w t p function of particular importance we find with the help of eqs 12 and 21 that the mean breakthrough time is 46 Œº c t w r f r p œï whereas the variance becomes 47 œÉ c 2 2 3 r p 2 œï t w t p 2 Œº c 2 pe compared with Œº m and œÉ m 2 as given in eqs 42 and 43 respectively the mean of the solute residence time does not change but the variance has been extended to a degree determined by fickian dispersion in the fracture this implies that both fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion have set into influence the degree of spreading of the breakthrough curve to see which effects dominate we may also follow eq 21 to define a p√©clet number pe c for the c f function it turns out from eqs 46 47 and 28 that 48 1 pe c 1 pe f 1 pe m as a result pe c can be viewed as the total resistance to spread of the solute mass through the fracture matrix system it quantifies the combined effects of two resistors connected in parallel in retarding solute transport one has a resistance of pe f resulting solely from the effect of fickian dispersion in the fracture and the other has a resistance of pe m accounting for the influence of diffusion and sorption in the rock matrix due however to the identity given in eq 28 pe f could also be understood as a measure of the relative importance of advection and fickian dispersion in transporting the solute along the fracture likewise eq 44 or 45 indicates that pe m might also be used to give an indication of the relative influence of advection and matrix diffusion in spreading the solute mass we may therefore define the ratio between pe m and pe f as a criterion to evaluate the relative significance of matrix diffusion and fickian dispersion in determining the behavior of the breakthrough curves it follows from eq 48 and also discussions in section 4 3 2 that only when pe m pe f 1 i e when pe 3 œï t w t p the effect of fickian dispersion could be neglected at late time making the g t r f t w t p function applicable to describe the late time c f concentration otherwise eq 46 and also discussions in section 4 3 1 suggest that only if r p œï r f the influence of matrix diffusion could be safely ignored at early time leading the early time part of the breakthrough curve to be well represented by the m 0 f t r f function in any case eq 48 implies that it is impossible to determine pe m and pe f simultaneously solely from the calculated pe c unless one of them could be estimated from e g the early time or the late time performance of the breakthrough curves for this reason the model should be used with caution even under conditions where the assumptions behind the model are considered to be fair in interpreting the results of field tracer tests for instance the wpde1 2 experiments were carried out by posiva voutilainen et al 2014 in the experiments a short concentrated pulse of selected radionuclides is injected into a water flow through an artificial fracture as the tracer pulse travels with the water flow in the artificial fracture tracers will diffuse into the rock matrix surrounding the artificial fracture where they may also sorb as the pulse passes the concentration gradients are reversed and the tracers will diffuse out of the rock matrix and into the flowing water by detecting their activities in the water phase at the outlet of the fracture breakthrough curves are obtained which can be analyzed by modelling l√∂fgren and nilsson 2017 obviously the idea behind the experiments is simple and the measured breakthrough curve can be approximated by applying the current model however the predicted breakthrough curve deviates from the measured one considerably especially at early time thus one should be cautious when making use of the model in the interpretation of the field tracer tests 5 simulation and discussions having given a deeper insight into the physical significances and statistical properties of the f g and c f functions we now turn specifically to details of numerical implementation of the analytical solution as can be seen from eqs 19 and 31 evaluation of the c f function involves two integrals one results from the g function with an infinite upper limit and the other from the convolution of the f and g functions with finite limits as a result problems may arise if the g function was not properly calculated to address this problem we have developed in appendix c a simple approach to convert the g function into an integral with a finite upper limit on the basis of the solution in the limiting case as d with this approach the two integrations involved in the c f function can efficiently and accurately be computed by the method of adaptive gauss kronrod quadrature kronrod 1965 the results were shown to coincide in all cases studied with those obtained from the numerical inverse laplace transform strategies de hoog et al 1982 to illustrate this a comparison is made in fig 6 to the normalized breakthrough curves i e c f t w m 0 observed in case c as defined in table 1 with different penetration depth compared to the method of sudicky and frind 1982 our approach avoids the need to scan the integrands prior to integration and unstable divergent results from occurring as can be seen in fig 6 excellent agreements between our solution and the numerical solution of the inverse laplace transform have been achieved with only 200 gauss points involved in the g function integration of particular interest the simulation results shown in fig 6 illustrates that the mean of the solute residence time Œº c increases linearly whereas the variance œÉ c 2 increases quadratically with increasing in r p as one may expect from eqs 46 and 47 the pe c value does not however change much in the same d cases to explore specifically the influence of r p and d on the change of pe c we calculated pe c numerically from the breakthrough curves obtained in case d as defined in table 1 with r p 1 0 and 10 0 respectively the results are found to be in good agreement with analytically evaluated pe c from eq 48 as shown in fig 7 this comparison further demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of our algorithm the key point here is however that r p turned out to only have minor influence on pe c it takes slight effects only when r p 10 0 the curves obtained in larger r p cases were observed to overlap almost entirely with the results of r p 10 0 furthermore fig 7 shows that pe c always reduces to pe as d 0 whereas it approaches zero as d and that pe c deviates noticeably from pe m only when d 0 2 m this is generally true even if pe has been changed to a value far larger or smaller than 20 as a result one may expect that the effect of fickian dispersion would dominate the spreading of solute mass only at short distances downstream the fracture when the matrix penetration depth is rather small otherwise it will be entirely overshadowed by the effect of matrix diffusion once d 0 2 m all these findings suggest that we may simply apply eq 45 to estimate pe m for practical applications without significant loss of accuracy on pe c by eq 48 6 conclusion in this contribution we revisited the model of sudicky and frind 1982 and developed a new simple and robust solution for the problem of solute transport in a fracture matrix system with a finite penetration depth of a radioactive contaminant this new solution c f t similar to the result obtained in liu et al 2017 for a simple case where d takes the form of a convolution of two functions f œÑ and g t r f œÑ t p functions as given in eq 19 both f and g functions are special solutions to c f t liu et al 2017 and their use in eq 19 allows us to decouple the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport separately and independently the f function as given in eq 17 or 22 describes the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute resulting merely from advection and fickian dispersion liu et al 2017 this probability density function looks in appearance like the normal distribution as seen in eq 25 however depending on pe provided that pe is sufficiently high i e pe 500 f function can be approximated as a normal distribution as presented in fig 2 additionally we found that m 0 f œÑ is nothing but the impulse response of a fracture only system its p√©clet number pe f is equivalent to pe as given in eq 28 however this happens to hold only in the case when solute dispersion is caused solely by fickian hydrodynamic dispersion similar to m 0 f œÑ function g is actually the impulse response of the fracture matrix system in the case of a plug flow without any hydrodynamic dispersion liu et al 2017 as given in eq 31 the p√©clet number of g function pe g is found to be related to a defined dimensionless parameter Œ∫ in eq 36 in the case of Œ∫ 50 the normalized g function does not change much and it tends to approach the normal function as a result one can ignore the contribution of the rock matrix on solute transport in contrast the influence of rock matrix on solute transport is significant in the case of Œ∫ 10 4 as illustrated in fig 3 since the convolution of the f and g functions is c f function or the breakthrough curve obtained at a given point of observation downstream the performance of the breakthrough curve would generally be determined by both functions in a complex way provided that t r f t w i e when the input pulse has advected just a short distance past the point of observation the concentration in the fracture can roughly be described by eq 39 but only in the cases when œï is very small as can be seen in fig 4 one may ignore the influence of matrix diffusion on the early time behavior of the breakthrough curves when œï 0 1 likewise the late time performance of the breakthrough curve i e t r f t w can be approximated by eq 41 in fig 5 provided that pe 10 pe m pe m is the p√©clet number of eq 44 moreover we found that the p√©clet number of c f function pe c is associated with pe f and pe m by eq 48 as a result pe c can be viewed as the total resistance to spread of the solute mass through the fracture matrix system it quantifies the combined effects of two resistors connected in parallel in retarding solute transport pe f results solely from the effect of fickian dispersion in the fracture and pe m accounts for the influence of matrix diffusion and sorption in addition to this observation the ratio between pe m and pe f can further be used as a criterion by which one can evaluate the relative significance of matrix diffusion and fickian dispersion in determining the behavior of the breakthrough curves the effect of fickian dispersion can be neglected at late time provided that pe m pe f 1 i e pe 3 œï t w t p in contrast the influence of matrix diffusion can be safely ignored at early time only if r p œï r f in other words the effect of fickian dispersion would dominate the spreading of solute mass only at short distances downstream the fracture when the matrix penetration depth is rather small otherwise it will be entirely overshadowed by the effect of matrix diffusion once d 0 2 m in addition to the investigation of the f and g functions we also noticed the difficulty in numerical implementation of the derived analytical solution c f t the c f function involves two integrals one of which has an infinite upper limit this integral often makes the numerical implementation less accurate and significantly increases the computational burden as proposed in appendix c we used a simple approach to address this problem with this approach the two integrations involved in the c f function can efficiently and accurately be computed as can be seen in fig 6 furthermore the robustness and accuracy of our algorithm can be further demonstrated in fig 7 in which numerically evaluated pe c is in good agreement with the analytical one based on eq 48 moreover fig 7 implies that it is sufficient to use eq 45 to estimate pe m for practical applications without significant loss of accuracy on pe c we note additionally that the current model can also be extended to include different transport and interaction mechanisms such as non equilibrium sorption in a porous rock joshi et al 2012 this will be made in the near future acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the encouragement and financial support of the swedish nuclear fuel and waste management company skb appendix a analytical solution to the impulse response in a limiting case for ease of reference we derive here the analytical solution to c f t in the limiting case as pe i e d f 0 starting from eq 15 due to the appearance of the hyperbolic tangent function it is normally difficult to evaluate the inverse transform of eq 14 however we may make use of the identity sudicky and frind 1982 a1 l 1 exp g t w s tanh t p r p s

cos t p r p Œµ where both Œµ r and Œµ i are t w dependent and Œµ i t in eq a1 emphasizes the fact that Œµ i here is evaluated at time t this allows us to write immediately by applying the time shift

dimensionless variable a6 Œ∑ t p r p Œµ we may rewrite eq a5 as a7 g t r f t w t p m 0 œÄ r p t p 0 Œ∑ exp Œ∑ r cos Œ∑ i d Œ∑ with a8 Œ∑ r Œ∑ 2 œï t w t p sinh Œ∑ sin Œ∑ cosh Œ∑ cos Œ∑ and a9 Œ∑ i Œ∑

the limiting case as d the g t r f t w t p function would reduce to the one given by liu et al 2017 as argued in appendix b appendix b analytical solutions to the g function in some limiting cases in this section we analyze two cases of mass transport in the rock matrix to give an insight into the behavior of the g t r f t w t p function b 1 in the limiting case as d in this case the mixed hyperbolic and trigonometric functions in Œµ r and Œµ i would both become unity as a result Œ∑ r and Œ∑ i would reduce to Œ∑ r and Œ∑ i respectively with b1 Œ∑ r Œ∑ 2 œï t w t p and b2 Œ∑ i Œ∑ 2 2 t r f t w r p t p Œ∑ 2 œï t w t p consequently eq a7 for the g function simplifies to b3 g t r f t w t p d m 0 œÄ r p t p 0 Œ∑ exp a Œ∑ cos b Œ∑ 2 a Œ∑ d Œ∑ where we have defined b4 a œï t w 2 t p and b5

7222,a new simple and robust solution based on uniform steady state flow velocity is developed for the problem of solute transport in a fracture matrix system with a finite penetration depth of a radioactive contaminant into the rock matrix the solution is an extension of liu et al 2017 to finite penetration depth and an alternative solution strategy to the problem solved by sudicky et al 1982 the solution takes the form of a convolution of two functions the first function describes the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute resulting merely from advection and fickian dispersion the second function is actually the impulse response of the fracture matrix system in the case of a plug flow without any hydrodynamic dispersion as a result the effects of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport are decoupled and thus the resulting breakthrough curve can be analyzed in terms of those two functions in addition to this the derived p√©clet numbers of those two functions based on temporal moments are also found to be associated with the derived p√©clet number of the resulting breakthrough curve by comparing the p√©clet numbers of those two functions the contribution of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion to solute spreading is determined in a straightforward way this can aid to find out the dominating mechanism on solute transport and therefore the performance of breakthrough curve can be approximated by only one function in some specific cases keywords fractured rocks solute transport model matrix diffusion dispersion p√©clet number temporal moment analysis 1 introduction to aid safety and performance assessment of deep geological repositories for spent nuclear fuel numerous computation tools have been developed over the years berkowitz 2002 based on either continuum porous medium model e g long et al 1982 marsic et al 2001 discrete fracture network model e g dershowitz et al 1998 or channel network model e g gylling et al 1999 shahkarami et al 2016 the general aim of those models is to address the problem of water flow and solute transport in fractured crystalline rocks under circumstances of a repository however to simplify the problem they conceptualize the crystalline rocks as a network of fractures long et al 1982 dershowitz et al 1998 gylling et al 1999 for this reason those models often take the single fracture matrix system as a representative volume element of the network neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 hodgkinson and maul 1988 even though the models may make use of different numerical methods in solving the governing equations of solute transport in a single fracture matrix system they all consider fractures or channels as highly effective pathways for solute transport as compared to the host rock as a result they commonly apply the advection dispersion equation berkowitz 2002 to describe advective transport and hydrodynamic dispersion of solutes and fick s second law to account for the influence of diffusion into the rock matrix and linear sorption on retarding solutes neretnieks 1980 moreno et al 1985 these two equations of continuity coupled by mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface can conveniently be solved by finite difference or finite element methods grisak and pickens 1980 barker 1982 hodgkinson and maul 1988 to give evolutions of the solute concentration in both the fracture and the rock matrix however the effects of numerical dispersion are difficult to assess tang et al 1981 by comparison analytical solutions neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 not only help to speed up the calculation of the breakthrough curves over a single fracture but also make it easier to implement into the case of large field scales consisting of an arbitrary number of rock units with piecewise constant geological properties hodgkinson and maul 1988 mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 it is mainly for these reasons that many efforts have been made in the 1980s to develop either time or laplace domain analytical solutions for solute transport in a single fracture matrix system under different conditions in particular neretnieks 1980 presented an analytical solution for solute transport in a single fracture under the assumption that dispersion and diffusion along the fracture are negligible tang et al 1981 established a general transient solution for the same problem but accounted for fickian dispersion based on this work sudicky and frind 1982 derived the analytical solution for a system of parallel fractures hodgkinson and maul 1988 considered additionally that only a portion of the rock is available for matrix diffusion and derived an analytical laplace transformed solution for an arbitrary length decay chain these analytical solutions were indeed important contributions to advance our knowledge of solute transport in fractured porous rocks and paved the way for further development of models that take into account heterogeneity in either fracture e g including stagnant water zones in the conceptual model mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 shahkarami et al 2015 or matrix diffusion zhang et al 2006 mahmoudzadeh et al 2016 however analytical solutions in the time domain are commonly intricate and tedious tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 making it difficult to give an intuitive understanding of the interactions between dispersive and diffusive processes analytical solutions in the laplace domain generally limited to steady state flow velocity are often concise and easy to manage neretnieks 1980 liu et al 2017 but still cannot give a clear insight into the real phenomena in the fracture matrix system only very recently liu et al 2017 have found that the analytical solution to the problem studied by tang et al 1981 can actually be treated as the convolution of two functions the first function describes the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute in the fracture only system as if the rock matrix is impermeable the second function is the response of the fracture matrix system to the input source when hydrodynamic dispersion has been completely neglected given a solute advection time as a result the effects of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport have been decoupled in the sense that one may consider these two transport mechanisms separately and independently this understanding allows us to extend the analytical solution and physical interpretations into more general cases such as the one studied by hodgkinson and maul 1988 noticeably the derived analytical solution in liu et al 2017 is based on the assumption of semi infinite rock matrix in which the solute cannot encounter the far boundary and the results will not be impacted both by the distance to the boundary and the type of boundary condition imposed however to ensure more conservative long term predictions of solute transport it is preferable to have a finite extent of matrix in the assumption i e the depth available for the solute to penetrate into the rock matrix is limited liu et al 2006 skb 2006a 2006b sudicky and frind 1982 derived an analytical solution to this problem however their solution is apt to diverge when evaluated in addition to this difficulty with the numerical implementation that solution cannot give a clear understanding of the roles of matrix diffusion and fickian dispersion in influencing solute transport not to mention that we apply the solution to analyze observed breakthrough curves for these reasons we developed a new transient solution for the problem of solute transport in a fracture matrix system with a finite penetration depth of a radioactive contaminant this new analytical solution shows its superiority in stability of numerical implementation over the solution derived in sudicky and frind 1982 additionally it is also a convolution of two functions similar to the analytical solution derived in liu et al 2017 the effects of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport are still decoupled due to this decoupling the influence of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on the spreading of resulting breakthrough curves can be determined in terms of two corresponding p√©clet numbers the derivation of which is based on temporal moments as a consequence the connection between the analytical solution and the resulting breakthrough curves becomes apparent this readily shows which mechanism dominates the dispersion in this contribution we will first revisit the model of sudicky and frind 1982 in section 2 and then develop in section 3 a general transient solution for the problem of solute transport along a single fracture with a finite extent of matrix the focus is however put in section 4 on temporal moment analysis of the functions involved in the solution and on characterization of the breakthrough curves the objective is to evaluate the relative importance of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on spreading the solute mass through the fracture matrix system in section 5 some simulations are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the solution that is evaluated using adaptive gauss kronrod quadrature kronrod 1965 concluding remarks are given in section 6 2 mathematical model as schematically shown in fig 1 we consider the same fracture matrix system as that studied by sudicky and frind 1982 which consists of a set of identical fractures whose planes are parallel and equally spaced each of the fractures is represented by two smooth parallel plates with a constant aperture 2b embedded in a homogeneous porous rock the groundwater velocity is assumed to be constant and a tracer pulse is injected over a certain period of time at the origin of each fracture because the fracture matrix geometry repeats itself and because each fracture is symmetrical we only need to consider one half of a fracture and one half of the intervening porous matrix based on the same assumptions and simplifications of sudicky and frind 1982 the transport processes in the fracture matrix system can be described by two coupled one dimensional equations along with the initial and boundary conditions for the sake of completeness we rewrite the equations of continuity as 1 r f c f t u c f x d f 2 c f x 2 d p Œµ p 1 b c p z z 0 r f Œª c f and 2 r p c p t d p 2 c p z 2 r p Œª c p where the subscripts f and p refer to the fracture and the pore space of the rock matrix respectively x l and z l are the coordinates along and perpendicular to the fracture plane respectively t t denotes the time c ml 3 represents the concentration of the tracer r is the retardation coefficient d l 2 t 1 stands for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the fracture or the pore diffusion coefficient in the homogeneous rock matrix u lt 1 is the groundwater velocity in the fracture Œµ denotes the matrix porosity and Œª t 1 is the decay constant equation 1 describes the advection dispersion of a decaying solute in the fracture coupled with mass transfer at the fracture matrix interface and it is subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 3 c f x 0 0 4 c f 0 t c in t 5 c f t 0 where c in ml 3 describes the concentration of the tracer at the origin of the fracture as a function of time equation 2 describes the transport process of the solute in the rock matrix and it is subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 6 c p x z 0 0 7 c p x 0 t c f x t 8 c p z x d t 0 where d l denotes a distance from the fracture surface into the rock matrix up to which matrix diffusion is assumed to take place this distance can be regarded as being due to a symmetry boundary condition between parallel fractures separated by 2 d or else being the length scale for limited matrix diffusion although the general transient solution of the coupled system of equations has been obtained by sudicky and frind 1982 several decades ago its application for practical use is largely limited the reason is due mainly to the involvement of two integrals each of which has an infinite upper limit this significantly increases the computational burden when evaluated numerically for each point in space and time one can as suggested by sudicky and frind 1982 first scan the integrand prior to integration to determine its range and then locate the integration points within that range to solve the problem this may however make the numerical evaluation less efficient and apt to diverge in the results especially in the cases involving low water velocities or large dispersion coefficients to overcome these shortcomings we may apply the same strategy as that adopted by liu et al 2017 for obtaining the general transient solution for the problem of nuclide transport along a single fracture in a porous rock with d for simplicity however we will not account for radioactive decay in this study i e setting Œª 0 because the inclusion of this mechanism into the model or into the solution is trivial liu et al 2017 and also because our main interest is to explore the combined effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and matrix diffusion in retarding solute transport on the other hand it is noticed that the mode of tracer injection at the origin of the fracture can always be written as 9 c in t 0 c in Œæ Œ¥ t Œæ d Œæ where Œ¥ t is the dirac delta t 1 function the linearity and time invariance of eqs 1 and 2 together with the form of eq 9 make that the response to c in t injection i e the breakthrough curve takes the form of a convolution integral i e 10 c f t 1 m 0 0 c in t Œæ c f Œæ Œ¥ d Œæ where we have defined m 0 mtl 3 as the zeroth moment of the concentration history haggerty 1999 and the subscript Œ¥ refers to the case of a pulse or dirac injection defined as liu et al 2017 11 c in t Œ¥ m 0 Œ¥ t this suggests that we only need to address the impulse response c f t Œ¥ in the first place once it is known the solution to c f t in general cases can readily be obtained from eq 10 more importantly eq 10 implies that the impulse response c f t Œ¥ serves actually as the kernel of the solution to c f t and consequently it would determine the nature of the breakthrough curves in all other cases for this reason we will focus in this study only on discussion of the case of a pulse injection because the impulse response would exhibit more details and fine features than the solution to c f t in other cases as it resembles to a great extent the probability density function rather than the cumulative distribution function of the skewed normal distribution for this reason some necessary properties e g the peak point and the standard deviation can be provided by the probability density function in a straightforward way to simplify the notation we will omit the subscript Œ¥ in what follows 3 general transient solution a solution in time space is derived by the use of laplace transform method by applying the laplace transform to the system of governing equations along with the initial and boundary conditions it can be justified that the solution to c f in the laplace domain in the case of a pulse injection can be written as sudicky and frind 1982 12 c f m 0 exp pe 2 exp pe 2 1 4 pe t w tanh t p r p s g s r f s where c f mtl 3 denotes the laplace transformation of c f and s t 1 is the laplace variable t w t is the mean water residence time in the fracture t w x u t p t is the characteristic diffusion time in the rock matrix t p d 2 d p pe is the p√©clet number pe ux d f d f is the dispersion coefficient which must be fickian i e it behaves in the same way as a constant diffusion coefficient in writing this equation the g t 1 2 parameter as previously introduced by mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 2016 and liu et al 2017 has been defined as 13 g Œµ p r p d p b it follows from eq 12 that in the limiting case as pe we have 14 c f t w t p pe m 0 exp t w tanh t p r p s g s r f s where the arguments of c f are designed to emphasize the fact that it is both t w and t p dependent the inverse transform for c f t w t p pe is not straightforward but following the approach of sudicky and frind 1982 it can as presented in appendix a be written as 15 c f t t w t p pe g t r f t w t p h t r f t w where the arguments of the g ml 3 function imply that it depends partly on t r f t w and partly on t p h t is the heaviside step function with this result we may apply the same approach of liu et al 2017 to work on eq 12 leading to 16 c f 0 f œÑ c f œÑ t p pe d œÑ where the f t 1 function is defined as 17 f œÑ 1 2 œÄ 1 œÑ pe t w œÑ exp pe 4 t w œÑ œÑ t w 2 consequently the inverse transform for c f gives 18 c f t 0 f œÑ c f t œÑ t p pe d œÑ when use of eq 15 is made we find 19 c f t 0 t r f f œÑ g t r f œÑ t p d œÑ not surprisingly this result is exactly the same as that obtained by liu et al 2017 for a similar but simple case where d as discussed in what follows both f and g functions are special solutions to c f t liu et al 2017 and their use in eq 19 allows us to consider the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport separately and independently 4 characteristics of the breakthrough curves to facilitate understanding the behavior of solute transport in the fracture matrix system studied we perform temporal moment analysis for the f and g functions and also for the c f function because they all are impulse responses albeit under different conditions liu et al 2017 as is well known the first normalized temporal moment Œº represents the mean breakthrough time i e the time when half of the injected mass has passed through the observation location the second normalized temporal moment œÉ 2 denotes the degree of mixing of the solute mass within the specific system renu and suresh kumar 2014 more importantly Œº and œÉ 2 may be used together to characterize the resistance of the system to spread or deviation of the solute about the center of mass by way of a p√©clet number levenspiel 1999 defined as 20 pe s 2 Œº 2 œÉ 2 the larger the value of pe s is the less is the spreading of the breakthrough curve however temporal moments are usually difficult to determine directly from the analytical solutions in the time domain in such cases one may work instead in the laplace domain and make use of the identity aris 1958 21 m i t lim s 0 1 i c d i c ds i to evaluate the ith order of the normalized temporal moment for the breakthrough curve c x t of interest following this discussion we now turn to a detailed analysis of the f g and c f functions with a focus on understanding of their distinct physical meanings 4 1 analysis of the f function the f function as given in eq 17 can also be written in the form 22 f œÑ 1 2 œÄ d f œÑ x œÑ exp x u œÑ 2 4 d f œÑ as discussed by liu et al 2017 the f function depends only on u and d f at a given point of observation downstream the fracture and m 0 f œÑ is nothing but the impulse response of the fracture matrix system in the special case involving no surface sorption r f 1 and no matrix diffusion d p 0 for this reason œÑ in eq 22 should be understood as the solute residence time in the fracture only system or equivalently the solute advection time in the fracture matrix system the f function describes then the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute resulting merely from advection and fickian dispersion liu et al 2017 which is generally not normal as commonly assumed in dealing with velocity dispersion soler et al 2017 however if one defines 23 Œº f œÑ 2 t w and 24 œÉ f 2 2 œÑ 3 pe t w the f function may look in appearance like the normal distribution to give 25 f œÑ 1 2 œÄ œÉ f exp œÑ Œº f 2 2 œÉ f 2 eq 25 is actually the origin of approximating f œÑ as a normal distribution however it is not because both Œº f and œÉ f 2 are functions of œÑ which is the independent variable the real mean and variance of the solute advection time can nevertheless be determined from eq 22 and they are given respectively by 26 Œº f t w and 27 œÉ f 2 2 pe t w 2 this essentially suggests that the f function behaves differently i e it would spread out over a wider range of the solute advection time as t w increases or pe decreases whereas the mean of the solute advection time is always located at t w to verify if this is the case and also to illustrate the difference between f œÑ and the normal distribution n Œº f œÉ f 2 we show in fig 2 the normalized f œÑ i e t w f œÑ as a function of normalized time i e œÑ t w for different values of pe it is seen that the normalized f function does not resemble the shape of a bell at all in small pe cases only when pe has been increased to be large enough such as pe 500 would the difference between f œÑ and the normal distribution n Œº f œÉ f 2 become marginal additionally the results in fig 2 indicate that the larger the value of pe is the less spreading the solute advection time becomes this is however not surprising because the degree of spreading of any impulse response is known to be closely related to its mean and variance and it can be justified via eq 20 that the p√©clet number pe s of the solute advection time becomes 28 pe f pe where the subscript f in place of s emphasizes the fact that it is for the impulse response defined by the m 0 f œÑ function clearly pe s is now equivalent to pe this happens to hold however only in the case when solute dispersion is caused solely by hydrodynamic dispersion in more general cases of solute transport pe s as defined in eq 20 and pe would be different because pe s measures practically the degree of spreading of the breakthrough curve whereas pe gives an indication of the relative importance of advection and fickian dispersion in mass transport furthermore it should be stressed that the f function given in eq 17 or 22 has been developed under the conceptualization that the fracture has a constant aperture 2 b and is fully conductive for water flow with a constant velocity u liu et al 2017 this idealization allows us to evaluate the dispersion coefficient d f by taylor dispersion theory taylor 1953 bird et al 2002 that accounts for the effect of diffusion across the aperture of the fracture to give 29 d f d w u 2 b 2 52 5 d w where d w l 2 t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute in water the dispersion due to diffusion across the aperture of the fracture is however often very small and can be neglected compared to that across the width of the fracture with a variable aperture as discussed by liu et al 2017 the diffusion between streamlines at different locations over the width of a fracture or a channel perpendicular to the flow direction would be more important than that across the aperture because the flow channels are usually much wider than their apertures and for a channel with rhomboidal or wave shaped cross section we can generally write 30 d f d w u 2 w 2 c d d w where w l is the half width of the flow channel and c d 48 and 77 9 for the rhomboidal and wave shaped channels respectively with this modification of d f the f function given in eq 17 or 22 would still be applicable for tapered channels in more general cases in fractured crystalline rocks channel widths have been found to range from cm up to many tens of cm tsang and neretnieks 1998 in the wider channels where the flow is creeping the dispersion coefficient can become many orders of magnitude larger than the diffusion coefficient and lead to considerable dispersion it should be remembered that taylor dispersion takes some time to develop in the fluid in the tapered channel and that conditions for fickian dispersion to be valid may not be fulfilled for early times liu et al 2017 4 2 analysis of the g function the g function in eq 19 is the analytical solution to c f t in the limiting case as pe at time t r f œÑ given a solute advection time œÑ the distribution of which is determined by the f function it is actually the impulse response of the fracture matrix system in the case of a plug flow without any hydrodynamic dispersion i e d f 0 liu et al 2017 as detailed in appendix a the g function can be explicitly given by when t w has been replaced by œÑ in eq a7 31 g t r f œÑ t p m 0 œÄ r p t p 0 Œ∑ exp Œ∑ r cos Œ∑ i d Œ∑ with 32 Œ∑ r Œ∑ 2 œï œÑ t p sinh Œ∑ sin Œ∑ cosh Œ∑ cos Œ∑ and 33 Œ∑ i Œ∑ 2 2 t r f œÑ r p t p Œ∑ 2 œï œÑ t p sinh Œ∑ sin Œ∑ cosh Œ∑ cos Œ∑ where œï is the ratio between the pore volume in the rock matrix and the spatial volume of the fracture and it has been defined in eq a10 the form of an integral with an infinite upper limit in eq 31 often makes the numerical implementation of the g function less accurate one can as mentioned before apply the approach of sudicky and frind 1982 to circumvent of the problem but it often increases the computational burden considerably for this reason a different but simple strategy has been adopted in this study as discussed in detail in appendix c moreover the integral form of the g function also makes it difficult to obtain an analytical solutions to the mean Œº g and variance œÉ g 2 of the solute residence time t given œÑ and t p to address this issue we may first replace t w by œÑ in eq 14 to obtain the laplace solution of g t r f œÑ t p and then use eq 21 to evaluate its first and second normalized moments the results lead to 34 Œº g œÑ r f r p œï and 35 œÉ g 2 2 3 r p 2 œï œÑ t p it follows from the definition given in eq 20 that the p√©clet number of the g function can be written as 36 pe g 3 œï œÑ t p 1 r f r p 1 œï 2 this analysis suggests essentially that the g function when plotted as a function of t would become broader and broader as the product œï œÑ t p increases whereas the mean of the solute residence time deviates from the solute advection time œÑ by a factor of r f r p œï to verify if this is the case and also to illustrate the general properties of the g function we show in fig 3 the normalized g t r f œÑ t p i e g t r f œÑ t p œï œÑ m 0 as a function of the normalized time i e t r f œÑ r p œï œÑ for different values of Œ∫ œï œÑ t p it is seen that on one hand the mean of the normalized time is always located at unity consistently with the description of Œº g given in eq 34 on the other hand the greater the Œ∫ value is the less spreading the distribution of the solute residence time would be this is exactly what one may expect from the p√©clet number pe g defined in eq 36 Œ∫ can be understood as the ratio between the mass transfer rate into the rock matrix by diffusion and the mass transfer rate through the fracture by advection an increase in Œ∫ is equivalent to a decrease of d assuming that other parameters do not change which leads to an increase of the diffusive flux making the rock matrix quickly saturated as a result the effect of matrix diffusion on solute transport becomes marginal as shown in fig 3 in the case of Œ∫ 50 the normalized g function does not change much and it tends to approach the normal function obtained in the limiting case as d 0 see appendix b 2 one may therefore ignore the contribution of the rock matrix on solute transport as if it does not exist in the case of Œ∫ 10 4 the normalized g function also does not change much and it keeps parallel to the straight line obtained in the limiting case as d see appendix b 1 which gives a slope of 3 2 haggerty 1999 for this reason one may consider the rock matrix with Œ∫ 10 4 as if it has an infinite penetration depth in other cases the influence of Œ∫ on the normalized g function cannot be neglected because it gradually turns from a bell shape to a straight line as Œ∫ decreases or the penetration depth d increases this suggests that given a solute advection time œÑ the ratio between œï and t p would play a dominant role in determining the behavior of the g function it should however be noted that the definition of œï given in eq a10 is valid only for the idealized case where the fracture is considered to have a constant aperture 2 b for tapered channels it should be written as 37 œï v p v f where v p l 3 and v f l 3 are the pore volume of the rock matrix and the spatial volume of the fracture respectively with this description of œï the g function given in eq 31 would also hold in more general cases where the use of eq 2 is still acceptable for the description of solute transport in the rock matrix 4 3 analysis of the c f function as given in eq 19 the c f function or the breakthrough curve obtained at a given point of observation downstream is seemingly the convolution of the f and g functions it is then expected that the behavior of the breakthrough curve would generally be determined by both f and g functions in a complex way in some special cases however either f or g function will dominate as discussed below 4 3 1 the early time behavior at early time when t r f t w i e when the input pulse has advected just a short distance past the point of observation matrix diffusion might only have little effects in affecting the mixing of solute mass within the fracture the consequence is that the breakthrough curve would look nearly identical to that obtained in the limiting case as d 0 or equivalently œï 0 especially in the case of t p t w since in the limiting case as d 0 see appendix b 2 for detail 38 g t r f œÑ t p m 0 Œ¥ t r f œÑ the c f concentration from eq 19 would become 39 c f t m 0 f t r f this analysis suggests that the early time concentration in the fracture could roughly be described by eq 39 but only in the cases when œï is very small to illustrate this we compare in fig 4 different breakthrough curves obtained in case a as defined in table 1 at different œï values for a non sorbing solute it is seen that only when œï 0 1 or generally when r p œï 0 1 r f one may ignore the influence of matrix diffusion on the early time behavior of the breakthrough curves this indicates that given a typical value of b 0 05 mm and Œµ p 0 006 matrix diffusion would always make the early time breakthrough curves deviate considerably from that of a fracture only system as long as d 0 8 mm 4 3 2 the late time behavior at late time when t r f t w i e when the input pulse has advected far past the point of observation fickian dispersion will have a negligible effect on the c f concentration haggerty 1999 the breakthrough curve would then become nearly the same as that obtained in the limiting case as d f 0 or equivalently pe especially in the case of t p t w because in the limiting case as pe by following the discussions in section 4 1 40 f œÑ Œ¥ œÑ t w the c f concentration given in eq 17 reduces to 41 c f t g t r f t w t p which is the g t r f œÑ t p function evaluated at œÑ t w as a result the mean and variance of the breakthrough curve can directly be obtained from eqs 34 and 35 respectively to give 42 Œº m t w r f r p œï and 43 œÉ m 2 2 3 r p 2 œï t w t p consequently the p√©clet number of the breakthrough curve can be written from eq 36 as 44 pe m 3 œï t w t p 1 r f r p 1 œï 2 or approximately 3 Œ∫ evaluated at œÑ t w since r p œï r f often holds i e 45 pe m 3 œï t w t p this analysis suggests that the late time concentration in the fracture would gradually be dominated by the g function as pe increases only in the case when pe has become sufficiently large compared to pe m can one safely ignore the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion on the late time behavior of the breakthrough curves to illustrate this we compare in fig 5 different breakthrough curves obtained in case b as defined in table 1 at different pe values for a weakly sorbing solute clearly the discrepancy between the late time part of the breakthrough curves and the g t r f t w t p function has become marginal when pe 30 in fig 5 a and pe 300 in fig 5 b since the cases of fig 5 a and b correspond to pe m 3 and 30 respectively one may expect that the effect of fickian dispersion would become unimportant in spreading solute mass at late time when t r f t w provided that pe 10 pe m as a matter of fact the ratio between pe and pe m can as discussed below be taken as a criteria to evaluate the relative importance of fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion 4 3 3 the statistical properties the c f function as given in eq 19 can also be regarded as the mean of the g functions the probability distribution of which is defined by the f function in terms of the solute advection time it is therefore a modified version of the g function obtained in the case of œÑ t w i e g t r f t w t p implying that the behavior of the breakthrough curve or the solute residence time distribution would always deviate somehow from that of the g t r f t w t p function of particular importance we find with the help of eqs 12 and 21 that the mean breakthrough time is 46 Œº c t w r f r p œï whereas the variance becomes 47 œÉ c 2 2 3 r p 2 œï t w t p 2 Œº c 2 pe compared with Œº m and œÉ m 2 as given in eqs 42 and 43 respectively the mean of the solute residence time does not change but the variance has been extended to a degree determined by fickian dispersion in the fracture this implies that both fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion have set into influence the degree of spreading of the breakthrough curve to see which effects dominate we may also follow eq 21 to define a p√©clet number pe c for the c f function it turns out from eqs 46 47 and 28 that 48 1 pe c 1 pe f 1 pe m as a result pe c can be viewed as the total resistance to spread of the solute mass through the fracture matrix system it quantifies the combined effects of two resistors connected in parallel in retarding solute transport one has a resistance of pe f resulting solely from the effect of fickian dispersion in the fracture and the other has a resistance of pe m accounting for the influence of diffusion and sorption in the rock matrix due however to the identity given in eq 28 pe f could also be understood as a measure of the relative importance of advection and fickian dispersion in transporting the solute along the fracture likewise eq 44 or 45 indicates that pe m might also be used to give an indication of the relative influence of advection and matrix diffusion in spreading the solute mass we may therefore define the ratio between pe m and pe f as a criterion to evaluate the relative significance of matrix diffusion and fickian dispersion in determining the behavior of the breakthrough curves it follows from eq 48 and also discussions in section 4 3 2 that only when pe m pe f 1 i e when pe 3 œï t w t p the effect of fickian dispersion could be neglected at late time making the g t r f t w t p function applicable to describe the late time c f concentration otherwise eq 46 and also discussions in section 4 3 1 suggest that only if r p œï r f the influence of matrix diffusion could be safely ignored at early time leading the early time part of the breakthrough curve to be well represented by the m 0 f t r f function in any case eq 48 implies that it is impossible to determine pe m and pe f simultaneously solely from the calculated pe c unless one of them could be estimated from e g the early time or the late time performance of the breakthrough curves for this reason the model should be used with caution even under conditions where the assumptions behind the model are considered to be fair in interpreting the results of field tracer tests for instance the wpde1 2 experiments were carried out by posiva voutilainen et al 2014 in the experiments a short concentrated pulse of selected radionuclides is injected into a water flow through an artificial fracture as the tracer pulse travels with the water flow in the artificial fracture tracers will diffuse into the rock matrix surrounding the artificial fracture where they may also sorb as the pulse passes the concentration gradients are reversed and the tracers will diffuse out of the rock matrix and into the flowing water by detecting their activities in the water phase at the outlet of the fracture breakthrough curves are obtained which can be analyzed by modelling l√∂fgren and nilsson 2017 obviously the idea behind the experiments is simple and the measured breakthrough curve can be approximated by applying the current model however the predicted breakthrough curve deviates from the measured one considerably especially at early time thus one should be cautious when making use of the model in the interpretation of the field tracer tests 5 simulation and discussions having given a deeper insight into the physical significances and statistical properties of the f g and c f functions we now turn specifically to details of numerical implementation of the analytical solution as can be seen from eqs 19 and 31 evaluation of the c f function involves two integrals one results from the g function with an infinite upper limit and the other from the convolution of the f and g functions with finite limits as a result problems may arise if the g function was not properly calculated to address this problem we have developed in appendix c a simple approach to convert the g function into an integral with a finite upper limit on the basis of the solution in the limiting case as d with this approach the two integrations involved in the c f function can efficiently and accurately be computed by the method of adaptive gauss kronrod quadrature kronrod 1965 the results were shown to coincide in all cases studied with those obtained from the numerical inverse laplace transform strategies de hoog et al 1982 to illustrate this a comparison is made in fig 6 to the normalized breakthrough curves i e c f t w m 0 observed in case c as defined in table 1 with different penetration depth compared to the method of sudicky and frind 1982 our approach avoids the need to scan the integrands prior to integration and unstable divergent results from occurring as can be seen in fig 6 excellent agreements between our solution and the numerical solution of the inverse laplace transform have been achieved with only 200 gauss points involved in the g function integration of particular interest the simulation results shown in fig 6 illustrates that the mean of the solute residence time Œº c increases linearly whereas the variance œÉ c 2 increases quadratically with increasing in r p as one may expect from eqs 46 and 47 the pe c value does not however change much in the same d cases to explore specifically the influence of r p and d on the change of pe c we calculated pe c numerically from the breakthrough curves obtained in case d as defined in table 1 with r p 1 0 and 10 0 respectively the results are found to be in good agreement with analytically evaluated pe c from eq 48 as shown in fig 7 this comparison further demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of our algorithm the key point here is however that r p turned out to only have minor influence on pe c it takes slight effects only when r p 10 0 the curves obtained in larger r p cases were observed to overlap almost entirely with the results of r p 10 0 furthermore fig 7 shows that pe c always reduces to pe as d 0 whereas it approaches zero as d and that pe c deviates noticeably from pe m only when d 0 2 m this is generally true even if pe has been changed to a value far larger or smaller than 20 as a result one may expect that the effect of fickian dispersion would dominate the spreading of solute mass only at short distances downstream the fracture when the matrix penetration depth is rather small otherwise it will be entirely overshadowed by the effect of matrix diffusion once d 0 2 m all these findings suggest that we may simply apply eq 45 to estimate pe m for practical applications without significant loss of accuracy on pe c by eq 48 6 conclusion in this contribution we revisited the model of sudicky and frind 1982 and developed a new simple and robust solution for the problem of solute transport in a fracture matrix system with a finite penetration depth of a radioactive contaminant this new solution c f t similar to the result obtained in liu et al 2017 for a simple case where d takes the form of a convolution of two functions f œÑ and g t r f œÑ t p functions as given in eq 19 both f and g functions are special solutions to c f t liu et al 2017 and their use in eq 19 allows us to decouple the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport separately and independently the f function as given in eq 17 or 22 describes the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute resulting merely from advection and fickian dispersion liu et al 2017 this probability density function looks in appearance like the normal distribution as seen in eq 25 however depending on pe provided that pe is sufficiently high i e pe 500 f function can be approximated as a normal distribution as presented in fig 2 additionally we found that m 0 f œÑ is nothing but the impulse response of a fracture only system its p√©clet number pe f is equivalent to pe as given in eq 28 however this happens to hold only in the case when solute dispersion is caused solely by fickian hydrodynamic dispersion similar to m 0 f œÑ function g is actually the impulse response of the fracture matrix system in the case of a plug flow without any hydrodynamic dispersion liu et al 2017 as given in eq 31 the p√©clet number of g function pe g is found to be related to a defined dimensionless parameter Œ∫ in eq 36 in the case of Œ∫ 50 the normalized g function does not change much and it tends to approach the normal function as a result one can ignore the contribution of the rock matrix on solute transport in contrast the influence of rock matrix on solute transport is significant in the case of Œ∫ 10 4 as illustrated in fig 3 since the convolution of the f and g functions is c f function or the breakthrough curve obtained at a given point of observation downstream the performance of the breakthrough curve would generally be determined by both functions in a complex way provided that t r f t w i e when the input pulse has advected just a short distance past the point of observation the concentration in the fracture can roughly be described by eq 39 but only in the cases when œï is very small as can be seen in fig 4 one may ignore the influence of matrix diffusion on the early time behavior of the breakthrough curves when œï 0 1 likewise the late time performance of the breakthrough curve i e t r f t w can be approximated by eq 41 in fig 5 provided that pe 10 pe m pe m is the p√©clet number of eq 44 moreover we found that the p√©clet number of c f function pe c is associated with pe f and pe m by eq 48 as a result pe c can be viewed as the total resistance to spread of the solute mass through the fracture matrix system it quantifies the combined effects of two resistors connected in parallel in retarding solute transport pe f results solely from the effect of fickian dispersion in the fracture and pe m accounts for the influence of matrix diffusion and sorption in addition to this observation the ratio between pe m and pe f can further be used as a criterion by which one can evaluate the relative significance of matrix diffusion and fickian dispersion in determining the behavior of the breakthrough curves the effect of fickian dispersion can be neglected at late time provided that pe m pe f 1 i e pe 3 œï t w t p in contrast the influence of matrix diffusion can be safely ignored at early time only if r p œï r f in other words the effect of fickian dispersion would dominate the spreading of solute mass only at short distances downstream the fracture when the matrix penetration depth is rather small otherwise it will be entirely overshadowed by the effect of matrix diffusion once d 0 2 m in addition to the investigation of the f and g functions we also noticed the difficulty in numerical implementation of the derived analytical solution c f t the c f function involves two integrals one of which has an infinite upper limit this integral often makes the numerical implementation less accurate and significantly increases the computational burden as proposed in appendix c we used a simple approach to address this problem with this approach the two integrations involved in the c f function can efficiently and accurately be computed as can be seen in fig 6 furthermore the robustness and accuracy of our algorithm can be further demonstrated in fig 7 in which numerically evaluated pe c is in good agreement with the analytical one based on eq 48 moreover fig 7 implies that it is sufficient to use eq 45 to estimate pe m for practical applications without significant loss of accuracy on pe c we note additionally that the current model can also be extended to include different transport and interaction mechanisms such as non equilibrium sorption in a porous rock joshi et al 2012 this will be made in the near future acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the encouragement and financial support of the swedish nuclear fuel and waste management company skb appendix a analytical solution to the impulse response in a limiting case for ease of reference we derive here the analytical solution to c f t in the limiting case as pe i e d f 0 starting from eq 15 due to the appearance of the hyperbolic tangent function it is normally difficult to evaluate the inverse transform of eq 14 however we may make use of the identity sudicky and frind 1982 a1 l 1 exp g t w s tanh t p r p s

cos t p r p Œµ where both Œµ r and Œµ i are t w dependent and Œµ i t in eq a1 emphasizes the fact that Œµ i here is evaluated at time t this allows us to write immediately by applying the time shift

the limiting case as d the g t r f t w t p function would reduce to the one given by liu et al 2017 as argued in appendix b appendix b analytical solutions to the g function in some limiting cases in this section we analyze two cases of mass transport in the rock matrix to give an insight into the behavior of the g t r f t w t p function b 1 in the limiting case as d in this case the mixed hyperbolic and trigonometric functions in Œµ r and Œµ i would both become unity as a result Œ∑ r and Œ∑ i would reduce to Œ∑ r and Œ∑ i respectively with b1 Œ∑ r Œ∑ 2 œï t w t p and b2 Œ∑ i Œ∑ 2 2 t r f t w r p t p Œ∑ 2 œï t w t p consequently eq a7 for the g function simplifies to b3 g t r f t w t p d m 0 œÄ r p t p 0 Œ∑ exp a Œ∑ cos b Œ∑ 2 a Œ∑ d Œ∑ where we have defined b4 a œï t w 2 t p and b5

g sin m 0 œÄ r p t p 0 Œ∑ exp a Œ∑ sin a Œ∑ sin b Œ∑ 2 d Œ∑ it follows that by introducing a new variable b9 Œ≤ Œ∑ 2 we can also write b10 g cos m 0 2 œÄ r p t p 0 exp a Œ≤ cos a Œ≤ cos b Œ≤ d Œ≤ and b11 g sin m 0 2 œÄ r p t p 0 exp a Œ≤ sin a Œ≤ sin b Œ≤ d Œ≤ this allows us to make use of the identities bateman 1954 b12 0 exp a x cos a x cos bx d x œÄ a 2 2 b 3 exp a 2 2 b b 0 andre a im a and

numerical evaluation of g t r f t w t p as given in eq a7 we notice that there exists a critical value of Œ∑ c beyond which the mixed hyperbolic and trigonometric functions in both Œ∑ r and Œ∑ i would approach unity as shown in fig 8 as a result we can write for Œ∑ c 8 c1 g t r f t w t p g t r f t w t p d g diff where g diff is the difference between g t r f t w t p and its value in the limiting

given in eq b17 is only an exponential function the numerical evaluation of g t r f t w t p would now become effective there is no need to scan the integrand prior to integration as that required by the solution of sudicky and frind 1982 the key is then a proper choice of the Œ∑ c value which would influence the accuracy of the numerical integration to some extent the larger the Œ∑ c value is the

7223,the preceding and succeeding precipitation p s p of a precipitation extreme often contribute to flooding initiated by the extreme event itself in this study the concept of event based extreme precipitation eep defined as a precipitation event daily precipitation 1 mm for successive days having at least one daily precipitation extreme daily precipitation the 99th percentile is proposed to consider p s p of daily extreme precipitation further the time distribution patterns trends and return levels of eeps across china are analyzed based on a 0 5 0 5 gridded precipitation dataset covering 1961 2016 the data demonstrate the eep concept that multi day eep with daily extreme precipitation occurring late in the event is predominant in china except for the northwest where single day eep prevails over west china eep is increasing and becomes more temporally concentrated in the lower lantsang river along the southeast coastline and on the hainan island the 20 and 50 yr return levels of eep would exceed 300 and 400 mm respectively moreover global warming possibly induces more single day eeps in the northwest the eep concept may help guide attempts to manage extreme precipitation on event basis which is particularly useful for regions characterized by long lasting extreme precipitation keywords event based extreme precipitation time distribution pattern trend return level china 1 introduction the fifth intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported that the atmospheric temperature during the last century has increased by approximately 0 74 c and is projected to increase another 1 8 4 c in the coming century ipcc 2014 an important consequence of the increase in air temperature is that the atmosphere tends to hold much more water vapors leading to intensification of extreme precipitation across many regions ipcc 2014 donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2016 prein et al 2016 wang et al 2017a understanding extreme precipitation behaviors is essential and increasingly necessary for flooding prevention disaster prediction and mitigation easterling et al 2000 kendon et al 2014 capello et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 a precipitation event is often characterized by three stages i e initiation development and decay stages which altogether may last a few days white et al 2017 occasionally extreme precipitation occurs during the development stage where precipitation intensity exceeds a given threshold or a percentile value xu et al 2012 hitchens et al 2013 for such a precipitation event containing extreme precipitation the total precipitation amount is composed of extreme precipitation and the preceding and succeeding precipitation p s p most of studies on extreme precipitation characteristics e g frequency duration and amount often separate extreme precipitation from p s p karl and knight 1998 wentz et al 2007 min et al 2011 vittal et al 2013 ma et al 2015 xiao et al 2016 in fact while extreme precipitation can pose considerable flooding p s p could worsen the situation hamidreza et al 2010 for example the heavy precipitation event that struck the yangtze huai river basin around 30 34 n 112 120 e from june 8th to 16th in 1991 has brought approximately 200 mm total precipitation the precipitation amounts on june 8th 13th and 14th were 40 50 and 45 mm respectively lu et al 2017 suppose the 50 mm precipitation on june 13th just reaches the standard of daily extreme the precipitation amounts on june 8th and 14th are less than this standard and could not be considered as extreme nevertheless the precipitation amounts on these two days are still fairly heavy and were reported to induce flooding as well tao 1993 lu and ding 1997 wang et al 2000 more importantly these two precipitation amounts occurred closely to that on june 13th and therefore the precipitation amounts on these three days altogether could trigger an extremely heavy flooding through cumulative runoff generation lu et al 2015 she et al 2015 therefore the overall impact of the three daily precipitation events might be underestimated if the 50 mm extreme precipitation is solely considered regardless of the 40 mm preceding precipitation and the 45 mm succeeding precipitation in this regard extreme precipitation should be better defined with consideration to p s p existing observational evidence has characterized daily extreme precipitation in terms of frequency intensity and amount goswami et al 2006 you et al 2011 madsen et al 2014 however the time distribution pattern tdp also referred to as the temporal profile of extreme precipitation remains highly uncertain and intractable for one natural extreme precipitation processes are rather complex and difficult to characterize ghassabi et al 2016 second and equally important the investigation on such issue often requires high quality data that are not widely available nowadays particularly in underdeveloped and developing countries zhao et al 2005 huffman et al 2007 tdp of extreme precipitation plays a critical role in hydraulic structure design numerical weather prediction hydrologic forecasting reservoir operation and flooding control since it determines surface runoff and river flow processes hamidreza et al 2010 it has only been discussed in some regions previously mostly on daily and small spatial scales keifer and chu 1957 pilgrim and cordery 1975 yen and chow 1980 huff 1990 cen et al 1998 bonta 2004 hamidreza et al 2010 ghassabi et al 2016 more recently meso scale and large scale tdps of extreme precipitation have received an increasing attention hitchens et al 2013 trier et al 2014 zuluaga and houze 2015 for china few systematic measurements have been made on tdps of extreme precipitation and previous studies mainly focus on daily extreme precipitation chen et al 2015 hu et al 2017 wu et al 2018 for multi day extreme precipitation over china however the tdps still remain unknown and require more documentation on the other hand although trends in extreme precipitation across china have been discussed in the last few decades wang and zou 2005 gemmer et al 2011 yang et al 2012 li et al 2016 the trends documented in published works may not completely agree partly due to the use of different extreme precipitation definitions datasets and study periods dash et al 2009 ghosh et al 2009 wu et al 2016 in particular when extreme precipitation is defined in different ways the characteristics and trends of extreme precipitation may differ substantially from one another vittal et al 2013 she et al 2015 a further study on trends in extreme precipitation over china can not only enable a comparison between studies but also enrich our knowledge of extreme precipitation changes which is beneficial for developing appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies guo et al 2017 this then is the focus of our paper where we introduce a new concept of extreme precipitation to consider p s p of extreme precipitation and examine the tdps and trends of extreme precipitation events in china within the concept framework a precipitation event is defined as daily precipitation no less than 1 mm for successive days you et al 2011 oueslati et al 2017 whilst a daily precipitation extreme is defined as daily precipitation exceeding the 99th percentile gemmer et al 2011 the precipitation event having at least one daily extreme is termed as an event based extreme precipitation eep by definition an eep could include daily extreme precipitation and p s p the eep concept can also identify extreme precipitation of different durations in an objective way which is an important step towards improving our understanding of extreme precipitation as an event based phenomenon lu et al 2017 white et al 2017 in addition to the introduction of the eep concept examination of tdps and trends of eeps in china we will estimate eep return levels and further discuss the relationship between eep changes and global warming we hope this study could help decision makers and stakeholders better manage extreme precipitation in a warming world 2 data and methods 2 1 data source a high resolution 0 5 0 5 gridded daily precipitation dataset v2 0 obtained from chinese meteorological administration http www cma gov cn is used in the study the dataset covers the period of 1961 2016 which was generated from 2472 observed rain gauge stations across china by thin plate spline interpolation method and gtopo30 global 30 arc second elevation data resampling the quality of the dataset was strictly controlled by national meteorological information centre nmic 2012 it is considered as the latest gridded precipitation data for china which has not yet been widely used wu et al 2016 lu et al 2017 the total 3825 grid points are stippled in fig 1 to explore the relationship between eep and global warming the gistemp global surface temperature dataset is employed in the study hansen et al 2010 this dataset is available at https data giss nasa gov gistemp and has been utilized to diagnose the relationship between precipitation change and global mean temperature anomaly in china ma et al 2015 2 2 regional division the precipitation regime over china indicates a substantial spatial variability due to the vast territory and complex terrain features yang et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to divide china into sub regions to capture regional features of changes in extreme precipitation guo et al 2017 previous studies on extreme precipitation over china have divided the country into several sub regions with different division standards ma et al 2015 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2017b in this study the china mainland is divided into four sub regions i e northwest china nw 33 50 n 74 100 e northeast china ne 33 55 n 100 134 e southeast china se 18 33 n 100 123 e and southwest china sw 21 33 n 78 100 e the four sub regions are shown in fig 1 2 3 definition of eep the first step of identifying eeps from precipitation time series is to define a threshold that delineates precipitation events generally the threshold of 1 mm is used to classify wet and dry days because very light precipitation less than 1 mm might be missed out and recorded as no precipitation in some cases you et al 2011 guo et al 2017 oueslati et al 2017 therefore for each grid point a precipitation event is defined as daily precipitation no less than 1 mm for successive days the following step is to discern daily extreme precipitation as illustrated in the previous study the percentile based method is currently widely used to identify extreme precipitation wang and zou 2005 moreover the 99th percentile is often employed to identify extremely unusual events lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 gemmer et al 2011 she et al 2015 wu et al 2016 as such for each grid point daily extreme precipitation is defined as daily precipitation exceeding the 99th percentile of all wet days during 1961 2016 the last step is to combine the results of the former two steps and identify eep in such a way that if there is at least one daily precipitation extreme during a precipitation event the precipitation event is considered as an eep by definition eeps are separated by at least a single day where the precipitation is less than 1 mm note that an eep may last only a single day 1 day eep hereafter and in such case it is equivalent to a daily extreme fig 2 shows the eep concept and exemplifies four eeps extracted from a precipitation time series on daily scale four indicators including frequency amount duration and concentration ratio are used to characterize eep the frequency is defined as the number of eeps in a year for an identified eep the duration is defined as the length of the event in days and the amount is referred to as the total precipitation during the event the concentration ratio is defined as the accumulated precipitation of all daily extremes divided by the total precipitation of the event taking the example of the event eepi 1 in fig 2 the formulations of duration amount and concentration ratio are given as 1 d i 1 t i 1 e t i 1 s 1 v i 1 t i 1 s t i 1 e p t dt e i 1 k 1 n p t i 1 k v i 1 n 1 2 3 where d i 1 v i 1 and e i 1 are the duration amount and concentration ratio of eepi 1 respectively t i 1 s and t i 1 e are the starting day and ending day of the event respectively n is the number of daily extremes during the event for eepi 1 n 1 and t i 1 k is the time of occurrence of the k th daily extreme during the event p t is the precipitation time series specifically for 1 day eep e g eepi in fig 2 the duration and concentration ratio are constant and both equal to 1 2 4 time distribution pattern real world extreme precipitation processes are complex and diverse and therefore it is difficult to conclude which time distribution pattern tdp could describe temporal profiles processes of extreme precipitation well keifer and chu 1957 yen and chow 1980 huff 1990 in the current study tdps of eeps are investigated on a large spatial scale i e over china by using the high spatial resolution data therefore a detailed classification of tdps of eeps across china is impossible because such work is complex and computationally demanding for simplicity the duration of each multi day eep is divided into two equal parts and the event tdp is classified according to the part of the event duration in which daily extreme precipitation is distributed this classification approach is derived from the existing studies which also divided the duration of precipitation extreme precipitation into several equal parts and classified tdps based on the positions of peak intensities zhang et al 1997 azli and rao 2010 chen et al 2015 wu et al 2018 three tdps are obtained through the approach and are abbreviated and introduced in the following tdp1 all daily precipitation extremes during an eep are distributed in the first half part of the event duration tdp2 all daily precipitation extremes during an eep are distributed in the second half part of the event duration tdp3 some of daily precipitation extremes during an eep are distributed in the first half part of the event duration while some are in the second half part occasionally a multi day eep may have only one daily extreme which occurs coincidently on the median day of the event correspondingly the duration is an odd number in such case the daily extreme belongs to neither the first half part of the event duration nor the second half part therefore such eep is considered as tdp1 tdp2 if the accumulated precipitation during the first second half part of the event duration is larger than that during the second first half part one should also note that 1 day eep does not have any tdp because it lasts only a single day in summary there are four types of eep patterns i e 1 day eep and three tdps fig 2 sketches the four eep patterns in which 1 day eep tdp1 tdp2 and tdp3 are represented by eepi eepi 1 eepi 2 and eepi 3 respectively in the current study analysis of the temporal patterns of eeps over china is conducted as well for each grid point for a specific time period the accumulated frequencies of 1 day eep and the three tdps are compared and the pattern with highest frequency is identified as the dominant one if the frequencies are identical the dominant pattern is the one with largest accumulated precipitation amount or with highest averaged concentration ratio if the accumulated precipitation amounts are also identical wu et al 2018 2 5 trend analysis the mann kendall mk test a nonparametric method originated from mann 1945 and kendall 1975 is recommended by the world meteorological organization for detecting the trend and significance of hydro meteorological variables huang et al 2012 tatli 2015 however mk test is not robust against autocorrelation which becomes a major source of uncertainty in testing and interpreting trends sun et al 2016 to eliminate the effects of autocorrelation in time series hamed and rao 1998 introduced a modified mk mmk test by taking the lag i autocorrelation into consideration which has been used in many studies yue et al 2002 deng et al 2018 therefore this study employs the mmk test to assess trends in eep indicators mmk provides a standard normal statistic z to judge whether the trend is significant or not a positive value of z indicates an upward trend while negative value signifies a downward trend z 0 represents no trend the 0 05 significance level is used as the critical value beyond which the trend is statistically significant huang et al 2012 in addition to the mmk test the sen s slope estimator another nonparametric method sen 1968 is used to measure the magnitude of eep trend deng et al 2018 the sen s slope estimator is expressed as 2 Œ≤ median x j x i j i 1 i j n where Œ≤ is the sen s slope indicating the steepness of the trend x i and x j are the data values at times i and j respectively n is the number of observations 2 6 estimation of eep return levels return levels of extreme precipitation are useful in hydrology to measure the severity of an event and are commonly applied in engineering design wu et al 2017 many infrastructures such as dams bridges and sewer systems are invariably designed for lifetimes exceeding 20 50 or 100 years gao and xie 2016 correspondingly the 20 50 and 100 yr return levels of extreme precipitation are often analyzed vittal et al 2013 gao and xie 2016 therefore the 20 and 50 yr return levels of eep are also estimated in this study according to the eep concept eeps could occur more than once in a year therefore the generalized pareto distribution is employed to estimate the return levels the generalized pareto distribution is a well known and exploited model for capturing the extreme tail behavior of precipitation capable of reflecting multiple occurrences of extremes in a year vittal et al 2013 langousis et al 2016 the generalized pareto distribution function is written as 3 f x 1 1 k x Œº œÉ 1 k k 0 1 e x Œº œÉ k 0 where Œº œÉ and k are location scale and shape parameters respectively the return level x t corresponding to the t year return period is estimated as 4 x t Œº œÉ 1 1 t k k k 0 Œº œÉ log 1 1 t k 0 where Œº œÉ and k are the estimated location scale and shape parameters respectively these parameters are estimated through the l moment method in this study hosking and wallis 1997 to eliminate the effect of sample size on the fitting this study carries out a bootstrapping of eep series to generate 1000 bootstrap samples for each grid point prior to the estimation of eep return levels efron 1979 the goodness of fit is evaluated using the kolmogorov smirnov test with the 0 05 significance level and if the test fails a non parametric kernel distribution is fitted instead of the generalized pareto distribution kim et al 2003 2 7 detection of relationship with global warming the relationship between eep and global mean temperature anomaly is explored through the cross wavelet transform method which is a relatively new and popular technique for detecting relationships between two hydro climatic or hydro meteorological variables torrence and compo 2010 deng et al 2018 this method has the advantage of examining the change features and coupled oscillations of two time series in both time and frequency domains deng et al 2018 it can also help understand how the phase angle represents the mechanism in causal and physical relationships between these time series grinsted et al 2004 in brief the cross wavelet transform is expressed as 5 w xy Œ± œÑ w x Œ± œÑ w y Œ± œÑ where x and y are two time series and w x Œ± œÑ and w y Œ± œÑ are the continuous wavelet transform of x and y respectively denotes the complex conjugate 3 results 3 1 dominance of different eep patterns fig 3 a shows the percentages of total frequencies for 1 day eep and the three tdps during 1961 2016 in a majority of the northwest 1 day eep occurs most frequently accounting for 30 70 of total events however 1 day eep occurs much less frequently in other parts of china where the percentage is generally below 20 with regard to tdp1 the percentage falls between 30 and 40 in most cases across china except for the northwest in some regions such as the upper amur river around 48 53 n 120 128 e and the lower pearl river around 22 25 n 107 115 e the percentages could be higher ranging from 40 to 50 for tdp2 it dominates in number over china except for the northwest accounting for 40 70 in general in contrast tdp3 rarely occurs in china with an overall percentage below 10 fig 3b depicts the percentages of total amounts during the period of record for 1 day eep and three tdps the patterns are similar with those of frequency percentages showing that total precipitation amount overall increases with total frequency comparing fig 3a with 3b it is found that 1 day eep contributes less to precipitation amount than it does to frequency in the northwest as opposed to tdp3 the above findings demonstrate 1 day eep occurs frequently in northwest china while tdp2 dominates the remaining regions on the whole however at the grid point scale this may not always be true as two or more eep patterns could show close frequencies for example in some places of the amur river basin the frequencies of tdp1 and tdp2 are seemingly identical therefore the dominant eep patterns in china for the past 56 years are further determined according to the principle described in the methods results are shown in fig 4 clearly tdp2 is dominant over most regions in china except for the northwest where 1 day eep prevails consistent with the results obtained from fig 3 however in the upper amur river the dominance of tdp2 is less prominent due to the dominant tdp1 tpd1 also prevails in some coastal regions around 23 25 n 114 120 e and in some places of the south tibetan plateau around 29 31 n 85 90 e but for other parts of china tdp1 is only sporadically distributed in space it is also worth emphasizing that tdp3 does not prevail anywhere in china due to its rare occurrence fig 3 3 2 long term mean characteristics here the long term mean characteristics of an eep i e the amount duration and concentration ratio over china are presented to differentiate from the eep indicators calculated from a specific time period e g the aforementioned total eep amount for the whole period of record in fig 3 in the remainder of this paper the amount duration and concentration ratio of an eep are termed as event amount event duration and event concentration ratio respectively fig 5 a maps the geographic distributions of long term mean event amounts of different eep patterns all show similar patterns with increase in event amount from northwest to southeast in general a wide distribution of event amount of 1 day eep smaller than 60 mm is clearly seen across china but in some places the event amount can be larger for example in the lower yangtze river around 27 38 n 112 118 e and the lower pearl river the event amounts can vary from 60 to 80 mm in particular on the hainan island 1 day eep could bring more than 100 mm precipitation compared to 1 day eep tdp1 over southeast china is much heavier the event amount of which is larger than 100 mm in general specifically in the lower pearl river and on the hainan island the event amount could be larger than 160 180 mm except for the southeast the other regions are characterized by event amount smaller than 80 mm relative to the event amount of tdp1 that of tdp2 larger than 100 mm is less observed in china while the event amount below 80 mm is widely found also note that the event amount of tdp3 is generally larger than 100 mm in china except for the northwest and specifically the event amount in the southeast is larger than 180 mm fig 5b shows the long term mean event duration patterns for tdp1 tdp2 and tdp3 on the whole tdp3 could last longer than tdp1 or tdp2 in arid regions such as northwest china tdp1 or tdp2 could last less than 3 days however tdp3 could last 3 4 days in many cases long event durations are mainly found in the southeast and the southwest for all tdps over the east periphery of the tibetan plateau around 25 33 n 90 102 e the event durations of three tdps are longer than 9 days in the southeast coastal regions tdp1 or tdp2 could last 5 7 days while tdp3 could last longer than 9 days relative to the event duration of tdp1 that of tdp2 shorter than 5 days is more broadly detected in other words for china as a whole tdp2 lasts shorter than tdp1 when looking into the event concentration ratios of tdp1 tdp2 and tdp3 it is clear that the event concentration ratios of the three tdps higher than 0 7 are discerned mainly in the northwest and the northeast fig 5c a striking finding is that tdp2 and tdp3 in a majority of the northwest and tdp3 in many regions of the northeast show event concentration ratios higher than 0 9 in contrast all tdps are featured with low concentration ratios over the east periphery of the tibetan plateau with magnitudes lower than 0 5 in the southeast coastal regions the event concentration ratios of tdp1 and tdp2 fall between 0 5 and 0 7 in addition the event concentration ratio of tdp3 overall is higher than those of tdp1 and tdp2 3 3 changes in dominant eep patterns to further understand how regional dominant eep patterns change over time the year by year dominant eep pattern is explored at each gird point and the changes in areal extents of dominant eep patterns for four sub regions are examined fig 6 shows inter annual changes in areal extents of four dominant eep patterns for four sub regions in nw the areal extent of tdp1 shows an increase before 1975 but afterwards its trend is ambiguous while it increases again after 2000 and reaches a peak in 2013 the areal extent of tdp2 displays an upward trend from the beginning of the data with a peak of 1 3 million km2 around 1980 but no clear trend is found for the remaining time period compared to the areal extents of tdp1 and tdp2 those of tdp3 and 1 day eep do not exhibit visible trends during 1961 2016 in both ne and se large fluctuations exist in the areal extents of four dominant eep patterns and the trends are difficult to conclude however there are sharp decreases in the areal extents of tdp1 and tdp2 in the most recent years more specifically the areal extent of tdp2 over ne has decreased from 1 9 to 0 8 million km2 during 2012 2016 whilst that in se drops from 1 3 to 0 5 million km2 in the period 2009 2016 no clear trends are found for all dominant eep patterns in sw table 1 further summarizes the trend magnitudes of the areal extents of four dominant eep patterns across the sub regions statistically significant upward trends in the areal extents of tdp1 tdp2 and tdp3 over nw are clearly seen with magnitudes of 2230 18 4933 52 and 1491 43 km2 yr respectively however in other sub regions the trends are mostly insignificantly downward 3 4 spatiotemporal patterns of trends in eeps trends in annual eep indicators of four eep patterns across four sub regions are listed in table 2 all indicators exhibit strong and statistically significant increases over nw the indicators of tdp2 have higher trends than those of other eep patterns the frequency amount duration and concentration ratio of tdp2 show growth rates of 0 15 decade 4 42 mm decade 0 6 day decade and 0 03 decade respectively there was also a general increase in eep indicators across sw and the trends are statistically significant except for the durations of three tdps and the amount of tdp2 among the amounts of four eep patterns that of tdp3 has the strongest increase with a growth rate of 3 53 mm decade different from nw and sw both ne and se are featured with inconsistent temporal patterns of trends in eep indicators and except for the duration of tdp1 in se which decreases significantly at a rate of 0 21 day decade the remaining indicators show insignificant trends therefore eeps have increased in nw and sw but display unclear trends over ne and se the spatial patterns of trends in eep indicators of tdp1 and tdp2 for the period 1961 2016 over china are examined as well note that the patterns of trends in 1 day eep and tdp3 are not considered because 1 day eep and tdp3 are rarely observed in most parts of china figs 3 and 4 and examining their trends at the grid scale is seemingly inconvincible since a majority of grids might suffer from inadequate samples as the results show positive statistically significant trends in four indicators of both tdp1 and tdp2 are mainly observed in the northwest and southwest while insignificant negative trends are found in the northeast and southeast fig 7 in line with the results in table 2 also note that the magnitudes of trends in eep indicators of tdp1 over china on the whole are smaller than those of tdp2 at the same time significant signals of tdp1 are less broadly observed than those of tdp2 in the northwest and southwest the growth rates of frequency amount duration and concentration ratio of tdp1 and tdp2 are generally smaller than 0 2 decade 5 mm decade 1 day decade and 0 03 decade respectively however the trends of frequency amount and concentration ratio in the arid regions of the northwest could be higher than 0 4 decade 10 mm decade and 0 06 decade respectively in the northeast and southeast the patterns are heterogeneous and significant signals are only sporadically distributed in space 3 5 return levels of eep the 20 and 50 yr return levels of tdp1 and tdp2 are estimated in this section again 1 day eep and tdp3 are not considered because of their rare occurrences as shown in fig 8 the 20 and 50 yr return levels of both tdps increase from northwest to southeast the spatial patterns of 20 yr return levels of tdp1 and tdp2 display a high similarity with magnitudes generally larger than 200 mm in the southeast and smaller than 50 mm in the northwest likewise the patterns of 50 yr return levels of two tdps are similar with magnitudes larger than 250 mm in the southeast and smaller than 50 mm in the northwest compared to the level of tdp1 that of tdp2 larger than 200 mm is more widely distributed in china there is a large difference between the 20 and 50 yr return levels of either of the tdps over the southeast the 50 yr return level higher than 250 mm is much more widely detected than the 20 yr return level higher than 250 mm regionally the lower lantsang river around 23 27 n 100 103 e some of the southeast coastal regions and the hainan island are all featured with 20 and 50 yr return levels higher than 300 and 400 mm respectively it is also noteworthy that in some places of the central china for example the downstream of the three gorges region around 28 32 n 107 110 e the 50 yr return levels are also high with magnitudes exceeding 250 mm in general 4 discussion 4 1 rationality and significance of the eep concept this study reveals that 1 day eep occurs much less frequently than tdp1 or tdp2 in a majority of china indicating that daily extreme precipitation is often embedded in longer lasting eeps on the whole the event concentration ratios of tdp1 and tdp2 over china range from 0 5 to 0 8 implying that p s p of daily extreme precipitation during an eep accounts for 20 50 of total precipitation of the eep this reflects the fact that p s p of daily extreme precipitation over china is often considerable and should not be neglected the proposed eep concept is closer to the understanding of real world extreme precipitation and may help guide attempts to analyze p s p initiated by daily extreme precipitation the concept is particularly necessary for regions characterized by long lasting extreme precipitation with low concentration ratio for examples the east periphery of the tibetan plateau and the yangtze huai river basin luo and chen 2015 moreover the proposed concept enables a new view of return level estimation of extreme precipitation as an example we randomly select four grid points respectively located in nw ne se and sw and estimate the 20 yr return levels of daily extreme precipitation daily precipitation larger than the 99th percentile at these grid points the return levels at these grid points are then compared with those obtained within the eep concept framework the return levels of tdp1 and tdp2 are higher than those of daily extreme precipitation for all grid points table 3 specifically for 3 and 4 grid points the return levels of tdp1 and tdp2 are approximately two to three times of those of daily extreme precipitation the difference at 1 grid point is less distinct possibly due to the dominance of 1 day eep in the northwest however it should be noted that this example does not demonstrate that the return level estimation of eep is superior to that of daily extreme precipitation we hope that the return level estimation of eep will provide a gateway to projecting extreme precipitation as an event based phenomenon 4 2 review of eep characteristics and changes for a majority of china tdp2 is predominant during 1961 2016 while 1 day eep prevails in the northwest the dominance of 1 day eep in the northwest is possibly ascribed to the local arid climate under which longer lasting eeps are rare li et al 2016 generally the event amount of eep increases from northwest to southeast and the event duration event concentration ratio is shorter higher in the north than in the south specifically eeps over the east periphery of the tibetan plateau are featured with long durations and low concentration ratios this might be partly due to the local topography effect that forces precipitation to hover in the region tang et al 2018 there is an increase in eeps over west china which is in close agreement with previous studies e g deng et al 2014 ma et al 2015 for the 20 and 50 yr return levels both show increases from northwest to southeast again consistent with the existing study wu et al 2016 4 3 implications for hydrology and water resources according to the classification principles of tdps described above tdp1 tdp2 reveals eep with daily extreme precipitation occurring early late in the event dunkerley 2012 emphasized that extreme precipitation events with late peaks can give rise to severer surface ponding and larger peak flows in comparison to those with early peaks the current study reveals that tdp2 is predominant over most parts of china which raises the alarm against severe flooding at the late period of an extreme event we also notice that the upper amur river is dominated by tdp1 instead of tdp2 some studies have speculated that although extreme precipitation events with early peaks are not as severe as those with late peaks in terms of total runoff generation their peaks are expected to occur more suddenly and may exert pressure on local emergency response of flooding wilkinson 1975 wu et al 2018 it is therefore important to give thought to the risk of flash flooding at the early period of an extreme event in the upper amur river the long term mean characteristics of eep enable us to have a glimpse of how much precipitation amount an eep brings how long it lasts and how it concentrates in time on average such survey is seldom carried out or even overlooked in publications however it is important for understanding regional hydro climatic regimes wu et al 2018 notably our results suggest caution against considerable p s p of daily extreme precipitation over the east periphery of the tibetan plateau where long lasting low temporally concentrated eeps are predominant moreover the characterization of eep might provide useful information for precipitation forecasting although numerical precipitation forecasting is available nowadays at local scales it may suffer from large biases and cannot be used directly daoud et al 2016 in practice the current precipitation forecasting skill in china relies on not only the numerical precipitation forecasting but also the knowledge of regional precipitation features artificial synthetic forecasting in the terminology of zhang 2016 the increased eeps over west china to some extent indicates a potential increase in regional water resources specifically this might be a favorable signal for the arid regions of northwest china where water resources are scarce wan et al 2015 also note that the concentration ratio of eep over the tibet plateau is increasing implying that heavy showers or intense snowfall might become more frequent over time awareness is therefore needed to manage flash flooding or snow disaster over the tibet plateau furthermore estimation of return levels of eep indicates that there is a high risk of flooding in the lower lantsang river in the downstream of the three gorges region on the hainan island and along the southeast coastline therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to these flood prone zones when making flood defenses and adaptations in china 4 4 relationship with global warming in a warmer climate the hydrological cycle is expected to intensify yet the manifestation of such an intensification at local levels remains uncertain white et al 2017 here we explore whether the intensified eep observed in west china is attributed to global warming given that tdp1 and tdp3 over the northwest and 1 day eep and tdp3 over the southwest are not prevailing fig 4 we only examine the relationship between 1 day eep tdp2 and global mean temperature anomaly for the northwest and the relationship between tdp2 and global mean temperature anomaly for the southwest there is a statistically significant positive correlation between 1 day eep frequency and global mean temperature anomaly with a signal of 8 16 years before 2005 and a signal of 4 16 years after 2005 over the northwest fig 9 the amount also exhibits a significant positive correlation with temperature anomaly with a signal of 8 16 years before 1990 and a signal of 4 16 years after then moreover the frequency and amount of 1 day eep tend to change with temperature anomaly synchronously in phase by comparison the correlation between tdp2 frequency amount and temperature anomaly is weaker and the phase relationship is less consistent specifically tdp2 frequency is significantly negatively correlated with temperature anomaly with a signal of 8 10 years during 1970 1985 anti phase while it is positively correlated with temperature anomaly with a signal of 2 3 years after 2000 as for the amount it shows a positive correlation with temperature anomaly with signals of 3 4 years and 2 4 years during 1961 1970 and during 1990 2000 respectively in the southwest a significant positive correlation between tdp2 frequency and temperature anomaly is seen with a signal of 2 4 years during 1990 1995 and a signal of 6 10 years after 2000 relative to the frequency tdp2 amount shows a stronger positive correlation with temperature anomaly with signals of 8 12 years and 2 16 years before 1975 and after 1990 respectively the above findings indicate that increased global mean temperature probably results in more 1 day eeps over the northwest however there is lack of strong evidence to support that tdp2 over the region is closely linked to global warming moreover increased global mean temperature possibly induces increase in tdp2 amount over the southwest since 1990s all these reveal on one hand that the responses of eeps to global warming can vary with eep patterns and on the other that global warming may not necessarily cause intensified extreme precipitation locally in fact extreme precipitation is not only driven by temperature but also affected by many other factors such as topography and urbanization goswami et al 2006 ghosh et al 2009 tang et al 2018 future work should therefore focus on the impacts of topography and urbanization on eeps over china 5 concluding remarks in this study the eep concept is proposed to consider p s p of daily extreme precipitation based on the concept the tdps trends and return levels of eeps in china are analyzed by using a 0 5 0 5 daily gridded precipitation dataset from 1961 to 2016 the main findings are summarized below 1 day eep only prevails over the northwest while tdp2 is predominant for a majority of china an eep is generally heavier in the southeast than in the northwest and tends to last longer with a lower concentration ratio in south china than in north china long lasting eep with low concentration ratio is prevailing over the east periphery of tibetan plateau in west china eep has increased over time with a higher concentration ratio the 20 and 50 yr return levels of eep in the lower lantsang river along the southeast coastline and on the hainan island would exceed 300 and 400 mm respectively the increase of 1 day eep over the northwest is closely linked to global warming our proposed eep concept is conducive to better understanding of extreme precipitation and may help guide attempts to analyze extreme precipitation on an event basis it would become important and useful for regions where long lasting extreme precipitation is predominant in addition the investigation of dominant eep pattern and event characteristics offers a view of hydro climatological regimes in china that can help decision makers manage extremes for example the dominant tdp2 suggests the necessity to defend against storm water at the late period of eep where peak intensity usually occurs on the other hand the analysis of trends in eep and the responses of eep to temperature enriches the knowledge of how extreme precipitation may change in future which can benefit water resources planning and management under a warming climate

7223,the preceding and succeeding precipitation p s p of a precipitation extreme often contribute to flooding initiated by the extreme event itself in this study the concept of event based extreme precipitation eep defined as a precipitation event daily precipitation 1 mm for successive days having at least one daily precipitation extreme daily precipitation the 99th percentile is proposed to consider p s p of daily extreme precipitation further the time distribution patterns trends and return levels of eeps across china are analyzed based on a 0 5 0 5 gridded precipitation dataset covering 1961 2016 the data demonstrate the eep concept that multi day eep with daily extreme precipitation occurring late in the event is predominant in china except for the northwest where single day eep prevails over west china eep is increasing and becomes more temporally concentrated in the lower lantsang river along the southeast coastline and on the hainan island the 20 and 50 yr return levels of eep would exceed 300 and 400 mm respectively moreover global warming possibly induces more single day eeps in the northwest the eep concept may help guide attempts to manage extreme precipitation on event basis which is particularly useful for regions characterized by long lasting extreme precipitation keywords event based extreme precipitation time distribution pattern trend return level china 1 introduction the fifth intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported that the atmospheric temperature during the last century has increased by approximately 0 74 c and is projected to increase another 1 8 4 c in the coming century ipcc 2014 an important consequence of the increase in air temperature is that the atmosphere tends to hold much more water vapors leading to intensification of extreme precipitation across many regions ipcc 2014 donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2016 prein et al 2016 wang et al 2017a understanding extreme precipitation behaviors is essential and increasingly necessary for flooding prevention disaster prediction and mitigation easterling et al 2000 kendon et al 2014 capello et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 a precipitation event is often characterized by three stages i e initiation development and decay stages which altogether may last a few days white et al 2017 occasionally extreme precipitation occurs during the development stage where precipitation intensity exceeds a given threshold or a percentile value xu et al 2012 hitchens et al 2013 for such a precipitation event containing extreme precipitation the total precipitation amount is composed of extreme precipitation and the preceding and succeeding precipitation p s p most of studies on extreme precipitation characteristics e g frequency duration and amount often separate extreme precipitation from p s p karl and knight 1998 wentz et al 2007 min et al 2011 vittal et al 2013 ma et al 2015 xiao et al 2016 in fact while extreme precipitation can pose considerable flooding p s p could worsen the situation hamidreza et al 2010 for example the heavy precipitation event that struck the yangtze huai river basin around 30 34 n 112 120 e from june 8th to 16th in 1991 has brought approximately 200 mm total precipitation the precipitation amounts on june 8th 13th and 14th were 40 50 and 45 mm respectively lu et al 2017 suppose the 50 mm precipitation on june 13th just reaches the standard of daily extreme the precipitation amounts on june 8th and 14th are less than this standard and could not be considered as extreme nevertheless the precipitation amounts on these two days are still fairly heavy and were reported to induce flooding as well tao 1993 lu and ding 1997 wang et al 2000 more importantly these two precipitation amounts occurred closely to that on june 13th and therefore the precipitation amounts on these three days altogether could trigger an extremely heavy flooding through cumulative runoff generation lu et al 2015 she et al 2015 therefore the overall impact of the three daily precipitation events might be underestimated if the 50 mm extreme precipitation is solely considered regardless of the 40 mm preceding precipitation and the 45 mm succeeding precipitation in this regard extreme precipitation should be better defined with consideration to p s p existing observational evidence has characterized daily extreme precipitation in terms of frequency intensity and amount goswami et al 2006 you et al 2011 madsen et al 2014 however the time distribution pattern tdp also referred to as the temporal profile of extreme precipitation remains highly uncertain and intractable for one natural extreme precipitation processes are rather complex and difficult to characterize ghassabi et al 2016 second and equally important the investigation on such issue often requires high quality data that are not widely available nowadays particularly in underdeveloped and developing countries zhao et al 2005 huffman et al 2007 tdp of extreme precipitation plays a critical role in hydraulic structure design numerical weather prediction hydrologic forecasting reservoir operation and flooding control since it determines surface runoff and river flow processes hamidreza et al 2010 it has only been discussed in some regions previously mostly on daily and small spatial scales keifer and chu 1957 pilgrim and cordery 1975 yen and chow 1980 huff 1990 cen et al 1998 bonta 2004 hamidreza et al 2010 ghassabi et al 2016 more recently meso scale and large scale tdps of extreme precipitation have received an increasing attention hitchens et al 2013 trier et al 2014 zuluaga and houze 2015 for china few systematic measurements have been made on tdps of extreme precipitation and previous studies mainly focus on daily extreme precipitation chen et al 2015 hu et al 2017 wu et al 2018 for multi day extreme precipitation over china however the tdps still remain unknown and require more documentation on the other hand although trends in extreme precipitation across china have been discussed in the last few decades wang and zou 2005 gemmer et al 2011 yang et al 2012 li et al 2016 the trends documented in published works may not completely agree partly due to the use of different extreme precipitation definitions datasets and study periods dash et al 2009 ghosh et al 2009 wu et al 2016 in particular when extreme precipitation is defined in different ways the characteristics and trends of extreme precipitation may differ substantially from one another vittal et al 2013 she et al 2015 a further study on trends in extreme precipitation over china can not only enable a comparison between studies but also enrich our knowledge of extreme precipitation changes which is beneficial for developing appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies guo et al 2017 this then is the focus of our paper where we introduce a new concept of extreme precipitation to consider p s p of extreme precipitation and examine the tdps and trends of extreme precipitation events in china within the concept framework a precipitation event is defined as daily precipitation no less than 1 mm for successive days you et al 2011 oueslati et al 2017 whilst a daily precipitation extreme is defined as daily precipitation exceeding the 99th percentile gemmer et al 2011 the precipitation event having at least one daily extreme is termed as an event based extreme precipitation eep by definition an eep could include daily extreme precipitation and p s p the eep concept can also identify extreme precipitation of different durations in an objective way which is an important step towards improving our understanding of extreme precipitation as an event based phenomenon lu et al 2017 white et al 2017 in addition to the introduction of the eep concept examination of tdps and trends of eeps in china we will estimate eep return levels and further discuss the relationship between eep changes and global warming we hope this study could help decision makers and stakeholders better manage extreme precipitation in a warming world 2 data and methods 2 1 data source a high resolution 0 5 0 5 gridded daily precipitation dataset v2 0 obtained from chinese meteorological administration http www cma gov cn is used in the study the dataset covers the period of 1961 2016 which was generated from 2472 observed rain gauge stations across china by thin plate spline interpolation method and gtopo30 global 30 arc second elevation data resampling the quality of the dataset was strictly controlled by national meteorological information centre nmic 2012 it is considered as the latest gridded precipitation data for china which has not yet been widely used wu et al 2016 lu et al 2017 the total 3825 grid points are stippled in fig 1 to explore the relationship between eep and global warming the gistemp global surface temperature dataset is employed in the study hansen et al 2010 this dataset is available at https data giss nasa gov gistemp and has been utilized to diagnose the relationship between precipitation change and global mean temperature anomaly in china ma et al 2015 2 2 regional division the precipitation regime over china indicates a substantial spatial variability due to the vast territory and complex terrain features yang et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to divide china into sub regions to capture regional features of changes in extreme precipitation guo et al 2017 previous studies on extreme precipitation over china have divided the country into several sub regions with different division standards ma et al 2015 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2017b in this study the china mainland is divided into four sub regions i e northwest china nw 33 50 n 74 100 e northeast china ne 33 55 n 100 134 e southeast china se 18 33 n 100 123 e and southwest china sw 21 33 n 78 100 e the four sub regions are shown in fig 1 2 3 definition of eep the first step of identifying eeps from precipitation time series is to define a threshold that delineates precipitation events generally the threshold of 1 mm is used to classify wet and dry days because very light precipitation less than 1 mm might be missed out and recorded as no precipitation in some cases you et al 2011 guo et al 2017 oueslati et al 2017 therefore for each grid point a precipitation event is defined as daily precipitation no less than 1 mm for successive days the following step is to discern daily extreme precipitation as illustrated in the previous study the percentile based method is currently widely used to identify extreme precipitation wang and zou 2005 moreover the 99th percentile is often employed to identify extremely unusual events lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 gemmer et al 2011 she et al 2015 wu et al 2016 as such for each grid point daily extreme precipitation is defined as daily precipitation exceeding the 99th percentile of all wet days during 1961 2016 the last step is to combine the results of the former two steps and identify eep in such a way that if there is at least one daily precipitation extreme during a precipitation event the precipitation event is considered as an eep by definition eeps are separated by at least a single day where the precipitation is less than 1 mm note that an eep may last only a single day 1 day eep hereafter and in such case it is equivalent to a daily extreme fig 2 shows the eep concept and exemplifies four eeps extracted from a precipitation time series on daily scale four indicators including frequency amount duration and concentration ratio are used to characterize eep the frequency is defined as the number of eeps in a year for an identified eep the duration is defined as the length of the event in days and the amount is referred to as the total precipitation during the event the concentration ratio is defined as the accumulated precipitation of all daily extremes divided by the total precipitation of the event taking the example of the event eepi 1 in fig 2 the formulations of duration amount and concentration ratio are given as 1 d i 1 t i 1 e t i 1 s 1 v i 1 t i 1 s t i 1 e p t dt e i 1 k 1 n p t i 1 k v i 1 n 1 2 3 where d i 1 v i 1 and e i 1 are the duration amount and concentration ratio of eepi 1 respectively t i 1 s and t i 1 e are the starting day and ending day of the event respectively n is the number of daily extremes during the event for eepi 1 n 1 and t i 1 k is the time of occurrence of the k th daily extreme during the event p t is the precipitation time series specifically for 1 day eep e g eepi in fig 2 the duration and concentration ratio are constant and both equal to 1 2 4 time distribution pattern real world extreme precipitation processes are complex and diverse and therefore it is difficult to conclude which time distribution pattern tdp could describe temporal profiles processes of extreme precipitation well keifer and chu 1957 yen and chow 1980 huff 1990 in the current study tdps of eeps are investigated on a large spatial scale i e over china by using the high spatial resolution data therefore a detailed classification of tdps of eeps across china is impossible because such work is complex and computationally demanding for simplicity the duration of each multi day eep is divided into two equal parts and the event tdp is classified according to the part of the event duration in which daily extreme precipitation is distributed this classification approach is derived from the existing studies which also divided the duration of precipitation extreme precipitation into several equal parts and classified tdps based on the positions of peak intensities zhang et al 1997 azli and rao 2010 chen et al 2015 wu et al 2018 three tdps are obtained through the approach and are abbreviated and introduced in the following tdp1 all daily precipitation extremes during an eep are distributed in the first half part of the event duration tdp2 all daily precipitation extremes during an eep are distributed in the second half part of the event duration tdp3 some of daily precipitation extremes during an eep are distributed in the first half part of the event duration while some are in the second half part occasionally a multi day eep may have only one daily extreme which occurs coincidently on the median day of the event correspondingly the duration is an odd number in such case the daily extreme belongs to neither the first half part of the event duration nor the second half part therefore such eep is considered as tdp1 tdp2 if the accumulated precipitation during the first second half part of the event duration is larger than that during the second first half part one should also note that 1 day eep does not have any tdp because it lasts only a single day in summary there are four types of eep patterns i e 1 day eep and three tdps fig 2 sketches the four eep patterns in which 1 day eep tdp1 tdp2 and tdp3 are represented by eepi eepi 1 eepi 2 and eepi 3 respectively in the current study analysis of the temporal patterns of eeps over china is conducted as well for each grid point for a specific time period the accumulated frequencies of 1 day eep and the three tdps are compared and the pattern with highest frequency is identified as the dominant one if the frequencies are identical the dominant pattern is the one with largest accumulated precipitation amount or with highest averaged concentration ratio if the accumulated precipitation amounts are also identical wu et al 2018 2 5 trend analysis the mann kendall mk test a nonparametric method originated from mann 1945 and kendall 1975 is recommended by the world meteorological organization for detecting the trend and significance of hydro meteorological variables huang et al 2012 tatli 2015 however mk test is not robust against autocorrelation which becomes a major source of uncertainty in testing and interpreting trends sun et al 2016 to eliminate the effects of autocorrelation in time series hamed and rao 1998 introduced a modified mk mmk test by taking the lag i autocorrelation into consideration which has been used in many studies yue et al 2002 deng et al 2018 therefore this study employs the mmk test to assess trends in eep indicators mmk provides a standard normal statistic z to judge whether the trend is significant or not a positive value of z indicates an upward trend while negative value signifies a downward trend z 0 represents no trend the 0 05 significance level is used as the critical value beyond which the trend is statistically significant huang et al 2012 in addition to the mmk test the sen s slope estimator another nonparametric method sen 1968 is used to measure the magnitude of eep trend deng et al 2018 the sen s slope estimator is expressed as 2 Œ≤ median x j x i j i 1 i j n where Œ≤ is the sen s slope indicating the steepness of the trend x i and x j are the data values at times i and j respectively n is the number of observations 2 6 estimation of eep return levels return levels of extreme precipitation are useful in hydrology to measure the severity of an event and are commonly applied in engineering design wu et al 2017 many infrastructures such as dams bridges and sewer systems are invariably designed for lifetimes exceeding 20 50 or 100 years gao and xie 2016 correspondingly the 20 50 and 100 yr return levels of extreme precipitation are often analyzed vittal et al 2013 gao and xie 2016 therefore the 20 and 50 yr return levels of eep are also estimated in this study according to the eep concept eeps could occur more than once in a year therefore the generalized pareto distribution is employed to estimate the return levels the generalized pareto distribution is a well known and exploited model for capturing the extreme tail behavior of precipitation capable of reflecting multiple occurrences of extremes in a year vittal et al 2013 langousis et al 2016 the generalized pareto distribution function is written as 3 f x 1 1 k x Œº œÉ 1 k k 0 1 e x Œº œÉ k 0 where Œº œÉ and k are location scale and shape parameters respectively the return level x t corresponding to the t year return period is estimated as 4 x t Œº œÉ 1 1 t k k k 0 Œº œÉ log 1 1 t k 0 where Œº œÉ and k are the estimated location scale and shape parameters respectively these parameters are estimated through the l moment method in this study hosking and wallis 1997 to eliminate the effect of sample size on the fitting this study carries out a bootstrapping of eep series to generate 1000 bootstrap samples for each grid point prior to the estimation of eep return levels efron 1979 the goodness of fit is evaluated using the kolmogorov smirnov test with the 0 05 significance level and if the test fails a non parametric kernel distribution is fitted instead of the generalized pareto distribution kim et al 2003 2 7 detection of relationship with global warming the relationship between eep and global mean temperature anomaly is explored through the cross wavelet transform method which is a relatively new and popular technique for detecting relationships between two hydro climatic or hydro meteorological variables torrence and compo 2010 deng et al 2018 this method has the advantage of examining the change features and coupled oscillations of two time series in both time and frequency domains deng et al 2018 it can also help understand how the phase angle represents the mechanism in causal and physical relationships between these time series grinsted et al 2004 in brief the cross wavelet transform is expressed as 5 w xy Œ± œÑ w x Œ± œÑ w y Œ± œÑ where x and y are two time series and w x Œ± œÑ and w y Œ± œÑ are the continuous wavelet transform of x and y respectively denotes the complex conjugate 3 results 3 1 dominance of different eep patterns fig 3 a shows the percentages of total frequencies for 1 day eep and the three tdps during 1961 2016 in a majority of the northwest 1 day eep occurs most frequently accounting for 30 70 of total events however 1 day eep occurs much less frequently in other parts of china where the percentage is generally below 20 with regard to tdp1 the percentage falls between 30 and 40 in most cases across china except for the northwest in some regions such as the upper amur river around 48 53 n 120 128 e and the lower pearl river around 22 25 n 107 115 e the percentages could be higher ranging from 40 to 50 for tdp2 it dominates in number over china except for the northwest accounting for 40 70 in general in contrast tdp3 rarely occurs in china with an overall percentage below 10 fig 3b depicts the percentages of total amounts during the period of record for 1 day eep and three tdps the patterns are similar with those of frequency percentages showing that total precipitation amount overall increases with total frequency comparing fig 3a with 3b it is found that 1 day eep contributes less to precipitation amount than it does to frequency in the northwest as opposed to tdp3 the above findings demonstrate 1 day eep occurs frequently in northwest china while tdp2 dominates the remaining regions on the whole however at the grid point scale this may not always be true as two or more eep patterns could show close frequencies for example in some places of the amur river basin the frequencies of tdp1 and tdp2 are seemingly identical therefore the dominant eep patterns in china for the past 56 years are further determined according to the principle described in the methods results are shown in fig 4 clearly tdp2 is dominant over most regions in china except for the northwest where 1 day eep prevails consistent with the results obtained from fig 3 however in the upper amur river the dominance of tdp2 is less prominent due to the dominant tdp1 tpd1 also prevails in some coastal regions around 23 25 n 114 120 e and in some places of the south tibetan plateau around 29 31 n 85 90 e but for other parts of china tdp1 is only sporadically distributed in space it is also worth emphasizing that tdp3 does not prevail anywhere in china due to its rare occurrence fig 3 3 2 long term mean characteristics here the long term mean characteristics of an eep i e the amount duration and concentration ratio over china are presented to differentiate from the eep indicators calculated from a specific time period e g the aforementioned total eep amount for the whole period of record in fig 3 in the remainder of this paper the amount duration and concentration ratio of an eep are termed as event amount event duration and event concentration ratio respectively fig 5 a maps the geographic distributions of long term mean event amounts of different eep patterns all show similar patterns with increase in event amount from northwest to southeast in general a wide distribution of event amount of 1 day eep smaller than 60 mm is clearly seen across china but in some places the event amount can be larger for example in the lower yangtze river around 27 38 n 112 118 e and the lower pearl river the event amounts can vary from 60 to 80 mm in particular on the hainan island 1 day eep could bring more than 100 mm precipitation compared to 1 day eep tdp1 over southeast china is much heavier the event amount of which is larger than 100 mm in general specifically in the lower pearl river and on the hainan island the event amount could be larger than 160 180 mm except for the southeast the other regions are characterized by event amount smaller than 80 mm relative to the event amount of tdp1 that of tdp2 larger than 100 mm is less observed in china while the event amount below 80 mm is widely found also note that the event amount of tdp3 is generally larger than 100 mm in china except for the northwest and specifically the event amount in the southeast is larger than 180 mm fig 5b shows the long term mean event duration patterns for tdp1 tdp2 and tdp3 on the whole tdp3 could last longer than tdp1 or tdp2 in arid regions such as northwest china tdp1 or tdp2 could last less than 3 days however tdp3 could last 3 4 days in many cases long event durations are mainly found in the southeast and the southwest for all tdps over the east periphery of the tibetan plateau around 25 33 n 90 102 e the event durations of three tdps are longer than 9 days in the southeast coastal regions tdp1 or tdp2 could last 5 7 days while tdp3 could last longer than 9 days relative to the event duration of tdp1 that of tdp2 shorter than 5 days is more broadly detected in other words for china as a whole tdp2 lasts shorter than tdp1 when looking into the event concentration ratios of tdp1 tdp2 and tdp3 it is clear that the event concentration ratios of the three tdps higher than 0 7 are discerned mainly in the northwest and the northeast fig 5c a striking finding is that tdp2 and tdp3 in a majority of the northwest and tdp3 in many regions of the northeast show event concentration ratios higher than 0 9 in contrast all tdps are featured with low concentration ratios over the east periphery of the tibetan plateau with magnitudes lower than 0 5 in the southeast coastal regions the event concentration ratios of tdp1 and tdp2 fall between 0 5 and 0 7 in addition the event concentration ratio of tdp3 overall is higher than those of tdp1 and tdp2 3 3 changes in dominant eep patterns to further understand how regional dominant eep patterns change over time the year by year dominant eep pattern is explored at each gird point and the changes in areal extents of dominant eep patterns for four sub regions are examined fig 6 shows inter annual changes in areal extents of four dominant eep patterns for four sub regions in nw the areal extent of tdp1 shows an increase before 1975 but afterwards its trend is ambiguous while it increases again after 2000 and reaches a peak in 2013 the areal extent of tdp2 displays an upward trend from the beginning of the data with a peak of 1 3 million km2 around 1980 but no clear trend is found for the remaining time period compared to the areal extents of tdp1 and tdp2 those of tdp3 and 1 day eep do not exhibit visible trends during 1961 2016 in both ne and se large fluctuations exist in the areal extents of four dominant eep patterns and the trends are difficult to conclude however there are sharp decreases in the areal extents of tdp1 and tdp2 in the most recent years more specifically the areal extent of tdp2 over ne has decreased from 1 9 to 0 8 million km2 during 2012 2016 whilst that in se drops from 1 3 to 0 5 million km2 in the period 2009 2016 no clear trends are found for all dominant eep patterns in sw table 1 further summarizes the trend magnitudes of the areal extents of four dominant eep patterns across the sub regions statistically significant upward trends in the areal extents of tdp1 tdp2 and tdp3 over nw are clearly seen with magnitudes of 2230 18 4933 52 and 1491 43 km2 yr respectively however in other sub regions the trends are mostly insignificantly downward 3 4 spatiotemporal patterns of trends in eeps trends in annual eep indicators of four eep patterns across four sub regions are listed in table 2 all indicators exhibit strong and statistically significant increases over nw the indicators of tdp2 have higher trends than those of other eep patterns the frequency amount duration and concentration ratio of tdp2 show growth rates of 0 15 decade 4 42 mm decade 0 6 day decade and 0 03 decade respectively there was also a general increase in eep indicators across sw and the trends are statistically significant except for the durations of three tdps and the amount of tdp2 among the amounts of four eep patterns that of tdp3 has the strongest increase with a growth rate of 3 53 mm decade different from nw and sw both ne and se are featured with inconsistent temporal patterns of trends in eep indicators and except for the duration of tdp1 in se which decreases significantly at a rate of 0 21 day decade the remaining indicators show insignificant trends therefore eeps have increased in nw and sw but display unclear trends over ne and se the spatial patterns of trends in eep indicators of tdp1 and tdp2 for the period 1961 2016 over china are examined as well note that the patterns of trends in 1 day eep and tdp3 are not considered because 1 day eep and tdp3 are rarely observed in most parts of china figs 3 and 4 and examining their trends at the grid scale is seemingly inconvincible since a majority of grids might suffer from inadequate samples as the results show positive statistically significant trends in four indicators of both tdp1 and tdp2 are mainly observed in the northwest and southwest while insignificant negative trends are found in the northeast and southeast fig 7 in line with the results in table 2 also note that the magnitudes of trends in eep indicators of tdp1 over china on the whole are smaller than those of tdp2 at the same time significant signals of tdp1 are less broadly observed than those of tdp2 in the northwest and southwest the growth rates of frequency amount duration and concentration ratio of tdp1 and tdp2 are generally smaller than 0 2 decade 5 mm decade 1 day decade and 0 03 decade respectively however the trends of frequency amount and concentration ratio in the arid regions of the northwest could be higher than 0 4 decade 10 mm decade and 0 06 decade respectively in the northeast and southeast the patterns are heterogeneous and significant signals are only sporadically distributed in space 3 5 return levels of eep the 20 and 50 yr return levels of tdp1 and tdp2 are estimated in this section again 1 day eep and tdp3 are not considered because of their rare occurrences as shown in fig 8 the 20 and 50 yr return levels of both tdps increase from northwest to southeast the spatial patterns of 20 yr return levels of tdp1 and tdp2 display a high similarity with magnitudes generally larger than 200 mm in the southeast and smaller than 50 mm in the northwest likewise the patterns of 50 yr return levels of two tdps are similar with magnitudes larger than 250 mm in the southeast and smaller than 50 mm in the northwest compared to the level of tdp1 that of tdp2 larger than 200 mm is more widely distributed in china there is a large difference between the 20 and 50 yr return levels of either of the tdps over the southeast the 50 yr return level higher than 250 mm is much more widely detected than the 20 yr return level higher than 250 mm regionally the lower lantsang river around 23 27 n 100 103 e some of the southeast coastal regions and the hainan island are all featured with 20 and 50 yr return levels higher than 300 and 400 mm respectively it is also noteworthy that in some places of the central china for example the downstream of the three gorges region around 28 32 n 107 110 e the 50 yr return levels are also high with magnitudes exceeding 250 mm in general 4 discussion 4 1 rationality and significance of the eep concept this study reveals that 1 day eep occurs much less frequently than tdp1 or tdp2 in a majority of china indicating that daily extreme precipitation is often embedded in longer lasting eeps on the whole the event concentration ratios of tdp1 and tdp2 over china range from 0 5 to 0 8 implying that p s p of daily extreme precipitation during an eep accounts for 20 50 of total precipitation of the eep this reflects the fact that p s p of daily extreme precipitation over china is often considerable and should not be neglected the proposed eep concept is closer to the understanding of real world extreme precipitation and may help guide attempts to analyze p s p initiated by daily extreme precipitation the concept is particularly necessary for regions characterized by long lasting extreme precipitation with low concentration ratio for examples the east periphery of the tibetan plateau and the yangtze huai river basin luo and chen 2015 moreover the proposed concept enables a new view of return level estimation of extreme precipitation as an example we randomly select four grid points respectively located in nw ne se and sw and estimate the 20 yr return levels of daily extreme precipitation daily precipitation larger than the 99th percentile at these grid points the return levels at these grid points are then compared with those obtained within the eep concept framework the return levels of tdp1 and tdp2 are higher than those of daily extreme precipitation for all grid points table 3 specifically for 3 and 4 grid points the return levels of tdp1 and tdp2 are approximately two to three times of those of daily extreme precipitation the difference at 1 grid point is less distinct possibly due to the dominance of 1 day eep in the northwest however it should be noted that this example does not demonstrate that the return level estimation of eep is superior to that of daily extreme precipitation we hope that the return level estimation of eep will provide a gateway to projecting extreme precipitation as an event based phenomenon 4 2 review of eep characteristics and changes for a majority of china tdp2 is predominant during 1961 2016 while 1 day eep prevails in the northwest the dominance of 1 day eep in the northwest is possibly ascribed to the local arid climate under which longer lasting eeps are rare li et al 2016 generally the event amount of eep increases from northwest to southeast and the event duration event concentration ratio is shorter higher in the north than in the south specifically eeps over the east periphery of the tibetan plateau are featured with long durations and low concentration ratios this might be partly due to the local topography effect that forces precipitation to hover in the region tang et al 2018 there is an increase in eeps over west china which is in close agreement with previous studies e g deng et al 2014 ma et al 2015 for the 20 and 50 yr return levels both show increases from northwest to southeast again consistent with the existing study wu et al 2016 4 3 implications for hydrology and water resources according to the classification principles of tdps described above tdp1 tdp2 reveals eep with daily extreme precipitation occurring early late in the event dunkerley 2012 emphasized that extreme precipitation events with late peaks can give rise to severer surface ponding and larger peak flows in comparison to those with early peaks the current study reveals that tdp2 is predominant over most parts of china which raises the alarm against severe flooding at the late period of an extreme event we also notice that the upper amur river is dominated by tdp1 instead of tdp2 some studies have speculated that although extreme precipitation events with early peaks are not as severe as those with late peaks in terms of total runoff generation their peaks are expected to occur more suddenly and may exert pressure on local emergency response of flooding wilkinson 1975 wu et al 2018 it is therefore important to give thought to the risk of flash flooding at the early period of an extreme event in the upper amur river the long term mean characteristics of eep enable us to have a glimpse of how much precipitation amount an eep brings how long it lasts and how it concentrates in time on average such survey is seldom carried out or even overlooked in publications however it is important for understanding regional hydro climatic regimes wu et al 2018 notably our results suggest caution against considerable p s p of daily extreme precipitation over the east periphery of the tibetan plateau where long lasting low temporally concentrated eeps are predominant moreover the characterization of eep might provide useful information for precipitation forecasting although numerical precipitation forecasting is available nowadays at local scales it may suffer from large biases and cannot be used directly daoud et al 2016 in practice the current precipitation forecasting skill in china relies on not only the numerical precipitation forecasting but also the knowledge of regional precipitation features artificial synthetic forecasting in the terminology of zhang 2016 the increased eeps over west china to some extent indicates a potential increase in regional water resources specifically this might be a favorable signal for the arid regions of northwest china where water resources are scarce wan et al 2015 also note that the concentration ratio of eep over the tibet plateau is increasing implying that heavy showers or intense snowfall might become more frequent over time awareness is therefore needed to manage flash flooding or snow disaster over the tibet plateau furthermore estimation of return levels of eep indicates that there is a high risk of flooding in the lower lantsang river in the downstream of the three gorges region on the hainan island and along the southeast coastline therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to these flood prone zones when making flood defenses and adaptations in china 4 4 relationship with global warming in a warmer climate the hydrological cycle is expected to intensify yet the manifestation of such an intensification at local levels remains uncertain white et al 2017 here we explore whether the intensified eep observed in west china is attributed to global warming given that tdp1 and tdp3 over the northwest and 1 day eep and tdp3 over the southwest are not prevailing fig 4 we only examine the relationship between 1 day eep tdp2 and global mean temperature anomaly for the northwest and the relationship between tdp2 and global mean temperature anomaly for the southwest there is a statistically significant positive correlation between 1 day eep frequency and global mean temperature anomaly with a signal of 8 16 years before 2005 and a signal of 4 16 years after 2005 over the northwest fig 9 the amount also exhibits a significant positive correlation with temperature anomaly with a signal of 8 16 years before 1990 and a signal of 4 16 years after then moreover the frequency and amount of 1 day eep tend to change with temperature anomaly synchronously in phase by comparison the correlation between tdp2 frequency amount and temperature anomaly is weaker and the phase relationship is less consistent specifically tdp2 frequency is significantly negatively correlated with temperature anomaly with a signal of 8 10 years during 1970 1985 anti phase while it is positively correlated with temperature anomaly with a signal of 2 3 years after 2000 as for the amount it shows a positive correlation with temperature anomaly with signals of 3 4 years and 2 4 years during 1961 1970 and during 1990 2000 respectively in the southwest a significant positive correlation between tdp2 frequency and temperature anomaly is seen with a signal of 2 4 years during 1990 1995 and a signal of 6 10 years after 2000 relative to the frequency tdp2 amount shows a stronger positive correlation with temperature anomaly with signals of 8 12 years and 2 16 years before 1975 and after 1990 respectively the above findings indicate that increased global mean temperature probably results in more 1 day eeps over the northwest however there is lack of strong evidence to support that tdp2 over the region is closely linked to global warming moreover increased global mean temperature possibly induces increase in tdp2 amount over the southwest since 1990s all these reveal on one hand that the responses of eeps to global warming can vary with eep patterns and on the other that global warming may not necessarily cause intensified extreme precipitation locally in fact extreme precipitation is not only driven by temperature but also affected by many other factors such as topography and urbanization goswami et al 2006 ghosh et al 2009 tang et al 2018 future work should therefore focus on the impacts of topography and urbanization on eeps over china 5 concluding remarks in this study the eep concept is proposed to consider p s p of daily extreme precipitation based on the concept the tdps trends and return levels of eeps in china are analyzed by using a 0 5 0 5 daily gridded precipitation dataset from 1961 to 2016 the main findings are summarized below 1 day eep only prevails over the northwest while tdp2 is predominant for a majority of china an eep is generally heavier in the southeast than in the northwest and tends to last longer with a lower concentration ratio in south china than in north china long lasting eep with low concentration ratio is prevailing over the east periphery of tibetan plateau in west china eep has increased over time with a higher concentration ratio the 20 and 50 yr return levels of eep in the lower lantsang river along the southeast coastline and on the hainan island would exceed 300 and 400 mm respectively the increase of 1 day eep over the northwest is closely linked to global warming our proposed eep concept is conducive to better understanding of extreme precipitation and may help guide attempts to analyze extreme precipitation on an event basis it would become important and useful for regions where long lasting extreme precipitation is predominant in addition the investigation of dominant eep pattern and event characteristics offers a view of hydro climatological regimes in china that can help decision makers manage extremes for example the dominant tdp2 suggests the necessity to defend against storm water at the late period of eep where peak intensity usually occurs on the other hand the analysis of trends in eep and the responses of eep to temperature enriches the knowledge of how extreme precipitation may change in future which can benefit water resources planning and management under a warming climate

7224,this study monitored four geothermal groundwater tw wells suanbo yuseong deoksan and seokmodo four carbonated groundwater cw springs chojeong bugang shin and bangadari and shallow groundwater gw in order to interpret the carbonating process from the seepage of co2 in a bid to figure out the carbonated reservoir where co2 mixing occurs the cw samples represent the condition of the final carbonated water as natural analogues the initial fresh water can be assumed to be the following depth the deep aquifer with 300 700 m below the surface level b s l and the shallow aquifer to be below 300 m b s l the pairs of hydrogen Œ¥2h and oxygen Œ¥18o isotopes indicated that all the groundwater samples had been recharged from meteoric water at various heights the Œ¥14c data of the tw samples present residence time from 1980 30 to 6400 30 years bp before present and the Œ¥13c data of dissolved inorganic carbon in the cw distributed from 3 to 10 range implying the mantle degassing effects regardless of seasonal variations the tw samples and the cw samples were shown to be the na hco3 type and the ca hco3 type respectively indicating these aquifers remain in closed conditions based on the chalcedony geothermometer results the carbonated reservoir of the cw samples were estimated to range between 43 08 and 83 13 c which were paired with the average temperature of the tw sites in turn the reservoir depth estimations taken by multiplying temperatures by geothermal gradients were estimated to range between 1 34 km and 3 90 km meanwhile the in situ data of the cw sites were estimated to range between 3 8 and 18 7 c and between 263 7 and 488 7 mv of redox potential of oxidizing condition which means there are the possibilities of shallow carbonated reservoir in order to delineate the hydrochemical changes of the fresh groundwater during carbonation at a deep reservoir and a shallow reservoir the phreeqc modeling was conducted with 0 0001 10 mol l 1 of co2 mixing as the co2 concentrations increased the tw and the gw displayed different ionic variations but the inland groundwater identically moved to the ca hco3 type the coastal tw can be reflecting the carbonation process of the coastal azmi section containing large quantities of salts the carbonation of these samples is triggered by 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 introduced into the reservoir but it still retained the na cl water type despite a log pco2 of over 0 5 the study results imply that there can be deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs responsible for developing carbonated groundwater it will be useful to estimate hydrochemical variations of groundwater resulting from the natural artificial co2 leakage keywords geothermal groundwater carbonated groundwater carbonating process natural analogue reservoir depth 1 introduction among various carbon capture and sequestration ccs technologies the geologic carbon storage gcs is accepted as one of the most feasible techniques the gcs is the technique injecting co2 into inland or coastal geologic medium in depths of about 800 m to 1000 m below surface level b s l metz et al 2005 benson and cole 2008 doe 2011 the stored co2 is supposed to be retained in reservoirs for a long time more than 99 of the injected co2 will be maintained for more than 1000 years and the acceptable leakage level has been suggested as less than 0 1 of storage volume per year harvey et al 2012 song and zhang 2012 miocic et al 2013 however when the co2 leakage from reservoir is above the acceptable level the water quality of the upper aquifer can be degraded due to the accelerated water rock interaction by the intruded co2 gas kharaka et al 2009 zoback and gorelick 2012 moreover once the excess co2 plume is leaked into the atmosphere through the preferential flow path such as fault or fracture it could result in human inhalation problems depending on the concentration and exposure time sch√ºtze et al 2012 gasparini et al 2016 therefore the gcs sites should be monitored intensively and regularly to track the movement of the injected co2 plume in reservoirs and to detect the hydrochemical changes in the aquifer above the cap rock terwel et al 2011 wallquist et al 2012 liebscher et al 2013 if the excess co2 plumes intrude into the aquifer above the cap rock the pressure will most likely rise or the hydrochemistry will change regardless of the masking effect of the other geologic matrix lewicki et al 2007 vishal and singh 2016 hovorka et al 2011 measured pressure change to detect the co2 leakage with a baseline monitoring in the deep aquifer which was called as above zone monitoring interval azmi the azmi section placed in the 400 m to 700 m below surface level b s l has the advantage of receiving minimal impact from artificial factors and facilitate an immediate response to physicochemical reactions occurring in the event of co2 leakage from reservoirs kharaka et al 2009 song and zhang 2012 tao et al 2013 jenkins et al 2015 consequently monitoring and identifying the changes in the physicochemical conditions of the azmi section will be an effective option for early leakage detection at the ccs sites however in the stage of developing gcs facility without any direct injection and monitoring practice understanding of potential reactions of leaked co2 with groundwater in various natural conditions is indispensable to predict and evaluate the risk for example the natural analogue studies on geothermal groundwater hot spring and carbonated groundwater soda spring could provide information on the background condition of the azmi and co2 intruded aquifers wilkinson et al 2009 kaszuba et al 2011 becker and lynds 2012 gal et al 2012 sch√ºtze et al 2012 do et al 2017 accordingly several studies have been performed to monitor the groundwater systems with stable conditions and to predict the gcs impact by the co2 injection wilkinson et al 2009 reported geochemical changes of groundwater from the analogue site near the sea using the variation of ion species and stable c and o isotopes gilfillan et al 2011 monitored he ne gases and c isotope in the natural co2 rich spring and groundwater to trace the co2 source where deeper mantle origin or shallower gcs reservoir origin gal et al 2012 monitored gases such as co2 222rn and 4he from the soil and water in the natural analogue site to figure out spatial influence of gas leakage under the ground and to suggest mixing processes as leakage from gcs site this study will focus on the hydrogeochemical data of geothermal groundwater tw carbonated groundwater cw and shallow non carbonated groundwater gw to construe the natural data as a part of the carbonating process fig 1 shows a schematic diagram related to the two possible pathways of the cw development from fresh groundwater one is the deep reservoir located in the azmi section path 1 and the other is the shallow reservoir located in the 50 m to 250 m b s l path 2 2 geological background fig 2 shows the location and the geology of the monitoring sites and their detailed descriptions are as follows kim and choi 1998 2 1 geology of geothermal groundwater sites this study conducted the tw monitoring from two geologic groups one group is suanbo and yuseong sites in the okcheon metamorphic belt region and the other group is deoksan and seokmodo sites in the mesozoic granite region fig 2 a to d the depth of the tw wells ranged from 300 m to 700 m b s l similar to the azmi depth of the gcs these sites are known for high geothermal gradient which originated from the decay energy of radioisotopes such as u th k etc lee et al 1998 kim 2007 the suanbo geothermal site is located on the seochangni formation of the okcheon metamorphic belt alternately composed of dark gray colored phyllite and black shale kim and lee 1965 the yuseong site consists mainly of jurassic two mica granite and schistose granite of hyangsan ri formation intruded quartz porphyry and quartz veins park et al 1977 the deoksan site is mainly consisted of jurassic daebo granite over gayabong and sangwangsan area shin et al 1989 the seokmodo site has bedrocks of precambrian metamorphic rock and mesozoic biotite granite intruded hornblende granodiorite along the southwest coast and also tw monitoring well is located on the biotite granite region hwang and kihm 2005 suanbo yuseong and deoksan sites are located in the inland area whereas seokmodo site is located in the coastal area within 500 m from the beachfront 2 2 geology of carbonated groundwater sites the cw in the study sites are generally produced from the fault zone along the geological boundaries fig 2 e to h the bedrocks of chojeong site consist of age unknown arenaceous phyllite layer and metasedimentary rocks of the okcheon metamorphic belt lee and kim 1971 the bugang site shows bedrocks of age unknown two mica schist crossing to the southwest direction and jurassic granites kwon and jin 1974 jurassic granites are composed of porphyritic granite and biotite granite with various directions of foliation the shin and bangadari sites are located close to each other approximately 2 km in distance and have the same geologic background of the precambrian gneiss intruded by age unknown gneiss jurassic sedimentary layer and mesozoic granite cheong et al 1975 jeong et al 2005 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analysis for hydrochemical elements this study conducted seasonal monitoring on the tw gw and the surface water sw of the suanbo yuseong deoksan and seokmodo sites and the cw and the sw in the chojeong bugang shin and bangadari sites from july 2013 to may 2015 it should be noted that the chojeong site coincided with the gw collection table 1 shows brief geographic and hydrogeologic information of the study sites since the hydrogeochemical data will give information on inherent aquifer characteristics at different depths at the sampling sites the in situ measurements including temperature ph electric conductivity ec and redox potential eh were taken laboratory analysis was performed on cations ca k mg na si sr rb anions f cl br no3 so4 hco3 and stable isotopes 13c 18o and 2h alkalinity titration was carried out using 0 01 n hydrochloric acid and metrohm 796 titroprocessor on the sampled day all water samples were filtered through 0 45 ¬µm membrane filters advantec mixed cellulose ester separately collected in polypropylene bottles for cation anion alkalinity oxygen hydrogen isotopes and kept in the refrigerator under 4 c for chemical analyses the cation samples were acidified with concentrated nitric acid to lower the ph to less than 2 for stable carbon isotope sampling target water was injected into a 10 4 torr vacuum glass bottle 100 ml volume bottle filled with 10 ml phosphoric acid by using a pre cleaned syringe with 0 45 Œºm pore filter for co2 gas production capasso et al 2005 the radiocarbon samples were collected through 1l hdpe bottles using flow cells to prevent mixing with atmospheric carbon gases then the samples were treated with 10 ml of naoh solution and 2 ml of bacl2 solution in an anaerobic chamber to obtain dic dissolved inorganic carbon precipitation in baco3 form the naoh and the bacl2 solutions were purged by reacting with n2 gas one day before the field experimentation in order to eliminate the dissolved co2 gas the cations and anions were analyzed using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8300 perkin elmer and the ion chromatography ic metrohm 883 basic ic plus at the hydrogeology laboratory at yonsei university the oxygen Œ¥18o and the hydrogen Œ¥2h isotopes of the water samples were analyzed using the stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry s irms gv instruments limited with 0 1 and 1 0 precision and then data reported relative to the standardized standard mean ocean water smow at the korea basic science institute in ochang the stable carbon Œ¥13c isotope of the dic was analyzed using the irms delta v plus thermo scientific germany with 0 1 precision relative to the pee dee belemnite pdb reference at the korea basic science institute in ochang the baco3 samples for radiocarbon dating Œ¥14c were combusted to transform graphite by means of an elemental analyzer with fe catalyst and hydrogen gas at 600 c these samples were measured at the kigam korea institute of geosciences and mineral resources through the accelerator mass spectrometer ams system with pelletized graphite samples 3 2 simulating hydrochemical variation of groundwater on the co2 intrusion to evaluate potential changes in water chemistry when groundwater reacts with dissolved co2 under various pressure and temperature conditions this study simulated different hydrochemical variations using a geochemical inverse model the phreeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 which calculates the solubility of gases in the high pressure condition peng and robinson 1976 the simulations follow equilibrium reactions among co2 water mineral phases according to the temperature pressure and groundwater composition the aquifer pressure through the geologic matrix was related to the pressure condition of groundwater system as increasing 10 bar per 100 m b s l perrin et al 2009 wertz et al 2013 the unit conversion was conducted for the pressure unit of 1 bar in order to calculate with 1 atm about 1 01 bar fig 3 shows the experimental temperature and calculated pressure conditions of the deep aquifer 50 71 c 32 76 atm as a path 1 and the shallow aquifer 13 22 c 6 25 atm as a path 2 which are suggested in fig 1 for the modeled condition this study set the minimum and the maximum concentrations of co2 from 0 0001 to 10 mol l 1 intruded into the non carbonated reservoir these models could provide the analyses on reservoir depth of carbonated groundwater as well as the chemical changes of non carbonated groundwater by co2 intrusion by using the phreeqc with equilibrium phases and reaction calculation on each site 3 3 estimating carbonate reservoir using geothermometer some dissolved elements are sensitive to temperature for precipitation or dissolution during water rock interaction accordingly a geothermometer was used to estimate the ion species from the reservoir temperature of the formed groundwater and there are two assumptions for the geothermometer calculations the first assumption is that temperature indicating elements have been formed through the hydrochemical equilibrium at the reservoir and the second assumption is that no mixing or dilution occurred when the groundwater rose to the surface arnorsson 1975 giggenbach 1988 choi 2002 even though the reservoir temperature estimation of cw by geothermometer still poses a challenge many studies have attempted to do geothermometer application thomas et al 2016 applied the chalcedony silica geothermometer to estimate the subsurface temperature in volcanic areas of iceland with temperatures of 110 c and higher choi 2002 studied the co2 rich groundwater of gangwon province in korea to calculate the carbonated reservoir temperature of the na hco3 type groundwater ranging between 140 and 160 c based on the thermodynamic calculation and empirical formula from the islandic geothermal groundwater fournier 1977 arn√≥rsson et al 1983 the silica geothermometer could be applied to low temperature reservoir estimation under 200 c edmiston and benoit 1984 at the islandic volcanic rock region chalcedony and quartz maintains equilibrium with groundwater at temperatures 20 to 110 c and above 180 c arnorsson 1975 the chalcedony geothermometer suggested by fournier 1977 can be applied 0 250 c temperature range and temperature equation is the following 1 estimated reservoir temperature c 1032 4 69 log s 273 15 where s means sio2 concentration mg kg michard et al 1986 reported that the groundwater ranging between 70 and 140 c reaches the equilibrium state with both quartz and chalcedony at a granite rock region meanwhile kharaka et al 1977 reported that in a sedimentary rock region groundwater below 70 c equilibrates with chalcedony and that above 70 c equilibrates with quartz thus this study applied the chalcedony geothermometer to simulate the changes of the carbonated groundwater at the tw sites 4 results and discussion 4 1 field measurement data table a1 specified the groundwater and surface water data of the tw sites the average temperatures of the tw of deoksan and seokmodo remained steady at 48 5 and 71 c respectively meanwhile the suanbo tw retained a consistent average temperature of 53 0 c sa 1 to sa 6 see table a1 but showed a large difference of approximately 6 c in sa 7 despite eh uniformity it is considered that gw sas 5 temperature 12 c could be mixed from the maintenance construction in the nearby stream the suanbo yuseong and deoksan tw showed weak alkaline properties with ph 7 91 8 88 the ph range of coastal tw and seokmodo varies from 6 44 to 6 11 which classify as weakly acidic to neutral the seokmodo tw was reported as sea water intruded tw lee et al 2011 and it can also be confirmed by the total dissolved solids tds value of measured field data approximately 21 000 23 000 mg l the seokmodo tw showed lower alkalinity of 35 25 36 89 mg l despite being affected by sea water intrusion alkalinity 113 11 mg l as caco3 these results indicate that the tw was influenced relatively more by gw alkalinity 18 85 mg l as caco3 and surface water than sea water during the mixing process redox potential eh of the seokmodo tw ranged between 88 7 and 102 1 mv implying reducing condition nordstrom and wilde 2005 in the suanbo site and the yuseong site the transitional conditions of 255 1 276 6 mv and 247 3 mv indicated the mixing of surface water table a2 represents the groundwater and surface water data of the cw sites eh of the cw samples ranged from 263 7 to 488 7 mv implying oxidizing condition this oxidizing condition can be interpreted as the electron pair exchange reactions between the dissolved oxygen within the cw and mineral of the bedrock mcbride 1994 stumm and morgan 1996 based on the findings by previous studies in korea koh et al 2002 choi 2002 jeong et al 2005 koh et al 2008 this study regarded the samples over 0 5 log pco2 as carbonated groundwater and those below 0 7 log pco2 as non carbonated groundwater the co2 partial pressure for the cj 1 sample was 1 28 which was especially low compared with other carbonated waters showing partial pressures from 0 03 to 0 49 the unusually low co2 partial pressure was attributed to the mixing of shallow non carbonated groundwater resulted from excessive pumping which in turn induced ph increase and co2 partial pressure decrease choi 2002 choi et al 2005 log pco2 in tables a1 and a2 present the values calculated using the phreeqc version 3 3 temperatures of the bugang cw site and the bangadari cw site were found to be relatively consistent however the sh 4 and sh 5 samples from the shin spring show especially low temperature that the sample was potentially exposed to the atmosphere during the sampling process the ec values for the cw samples ranged from 130 Œºs cm to 1600 Œºs cm and these observations are higher than those of the gw and the sw at each site the ec differences could be originating from acidic ph of the dissolved co2 which accelerates chemical reactions with bedrock minerals stumm and morgan 1996 clark and fritz 1997 2 dissolved inorganic carbon dic co 2 aq h 2 co 3 0 hco 3 co 3 2 3 h 2 co 3 0 co 2 aq h 2 co 3 h hco 3 reaction 2 shows the main components of dic in carbonated groundwater superscript refers to the dissolved co2 which is comprised of 99 85 of aqueous aq co2 phase and 0 15 of h2co3 phase 4 2 hydrochemical characteristics of geothermal and carbonated groundwaters 4 2 1 hydrochemical evolution fig 4 presents the gw plots and the sw plots of the tw and the cw sites major ion compositions of all samples are presented in tables a3 and a4 in fig 4 a the tw samples have na hco3 type as seen inside black solid lines and identified as alkaline water with prevailing hco3 ravikumar et al 2015 the gw samples red plots in fig 4 a show similar chemical properties to sw as earth alkaline water with prevailing hco3 which may infer that permanent stream sw consists of dominant gw contribution fetter 2000 the dotted circle located on the upper right of the piper diagram fig 4 a indicates the seokmodo samples from coastal areas they show a markedly higher na cl ratio compared to other water bodies this means that anion ratios for the seokmodo samples are maintained consistently at approximately 90 5 5 ratios for cl so4 hco3 whereas the na ratio in sea water was approximately 80 and showed a high concentration of cations on the contrary the ca ratios have an increasing trend from approximately 45 to 60 in the ascending order of geothermal groundwater surface water and shallow groundwater the cw samples have normal earth alkaline water with prevailing hco3 type especially the bugang shin and bangadari sites were categorized as ca hco3 type maintaining a consistent chemical composition regardless of seasonal climate changes fig 4 b and table a4 on the other hand the carbonated groundwater in the chojeong site was categorized as ca na hco3 type the plots inside the black dotted circle in fig 4 b are for the sh 6 and ba 6 samples showing the large increase of na ratio but the decrease of ca and mg ratio this possibly resulted from the influence of summer tourists getting into the surface water next to the sampling site 4 2 2 sea water intrusion in coastal area cl and br ion concentrations are generally low in groundwater and these elements are strongly conservative accordingly these ions have been used as the indicators of sea water intrusion or anthropogenic influence hem 1991 fetter 2000 fig 5 a shows the br cl ratio of the seokmodo samples with the reference line for the sea water ratio of sea water 0 003 drawn by dotted line the fact that all samples were plotted close to the reference line indicated that sea water mixing is a dominant process they may be categorized into two groups depending on the mixing ratio one is the sw and gw group type i and the other is the tw group type ii which is classified based on the degree of mixing dependence fig 5 b reveals the na cl ratio variation due to ion exchange via the intruding sea water recent sea water intrusion would be expected to decrease the na cl ratio of the advancing front in fig 5 b and c the type ii water group is situated between the dashed lines of sea water and the type i group but the dotted line indicating mixing shows a curved formation that implies the influence of cation exchange from water rock interactions the chemical equations for the reactions are as follows kim et al 2003 4 2 na or k ca x 2 2 na or k x ca 2 5 2 na or k mg x 2 2 na or k x mg 2 where x refers to ion exchange sites in the aquifer matrix in fig 5 d type i and type ii are clearly separated by chemical properties the general na cl molar ratio for sea water is known as 0 85 richter and kreitler 1993 bear et al 1999 meanwhile the molar ratio of the seokmodo samples were calculated as 0 70 for sea water 0 54 for geothermal groundwater 0 38 for surface water and 0 29 for shallow groundwater table a3 thus it seems to be affected by the mixing with fresh water and by the exchange reactions between na ions and ca mg ions within bedrock minerals fig 5 d shows that shallow groundwater has high ca mg so4 molar ratio compared to sea water this is because halite nacl deposits are often mixed with gypsum caso4 2h2o and anhydrite caso4 beds richter and kreitler 1993 mg2 is usually replaced in the position of ca2 which is why these minerals frequently exhibit admixtures of magnesium sulfates therefore the molar ratios of ca mg so4 versus na cl might be able to estimate sea water and fresh water interaction 4 2 3 isotopes related to groundwater evolution 4 2 3 1 stable isotopes 18o 2h and 13c of tw the oxygen hydrogen isotope composition from the south korean precipitation at the iaea wmo station pohang presented the local meteoric water line lmwl as Œ¥2h 8 06Œ¥18o 12 87 lee and kim 2007 the global meteoric water line gmwl proposed by rozanski et al 1993 was Œ¥2h 8 13Œ¥18o 10 8 fig 6 all water samples except those from coastal sites are plotted from 7 to 11 for Œ¥18o and 50 to 75 for Œ¥2h fig 6 indicating the water bodies of the deep reservoir and the shallow reservoir gw of the study sites originated from meteoric water in fig 6 a and d oxygen hydrogen isotopes values cluster in a relatively small range for both tw and cw samples reflecting their unique water rock reaction characteristics by referencing the altitude data on table 1 and fig 6 b isotopes become deplete with the altitude rising of the geothermal groundwater sites indicating that precipitation infiltrated into the deep aquifers without significant isotope fractionations on the other hand the seokmodo isotopes equation in fig 6 a is calculated Œ¥2h 6 13Œ¥18o 6 77 r2 0 95 and its slope is lower than that of the lmwl with 8 06 the d value d Œ¥2h 8Œ¥18o less than 10 indicates an evaporative enrichment of river water lee and kim 2007 the low correlation of seokmodo samples with the lmwl is attributed to vapor mass formed continuously and early stages of precipitation were reflected kim 2010 in the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o diagram the seokmodo water samples aligned to the sea water value and the tw Œ¥18o 4 39 to 4 50 and Œ¥2h 30 5 to 35 6 were more enriched than the gw table a5 because deeper groundwater wells are more affected by the intrusion of isotopically heavy sea water fetter 2000 13c analysis can be utilized to distinguish respiration and metabolic processes of microbe reactions with atmosphere and carbonates and determining for the inflow of deep origin co2 maher et al 2015 kim 2010 becker and lynds 2012 during the study period Œ¥13c values of the suanbo deoksan and seokmodo tw samples table a5 remained at 11 93 0 31 17 40 0 26 15 73 0 68 respectively the Œ¥13c values of these sites including yuseong Œ¥13c 18 0 are implied by the impacts of freshwater carbonates and organic materials clark and fritz 1997 4 2 3 2 radioactive carbon isotope 14c of tw in order to estimate the residence time of the hot spring sites this study carried out 14c analysis on the tw and gw samples the netpath adjustment modeling plummer et al 1994 was conducted to correct the ams results simulating 14c residence time of the total dissolved carbon tdc based on 14c pmc values time decay and carbon isotope mass balance equation are as follows

deoksan 3240 years bp before present present means 1950s table a5 the gw and the tw have a relationship of depth to residence time with the following formula 8 pmc percent modern carbon 0 06 depth 98 r 2 0 93 it was interpreted that the longer flow path of meteoric water would result in the development of high temperature geothermal groundwater on the other hand the deoksan shallow groundwater has a value indicating that mixing with present water such as surface water godwin 1962 fetter 2000 suckow et al 2013 4 2 3 3 stable isotopes 18o 2h and 13c of cw the oxygen hydrogen isotopes of the cw samples are clustered in the right side of the lmwl fig 6 c and d this phenomenon was interpreted to have resulted from two factors first the dissolved co2 might have accelerated water rock interactions between groundwater and bedrock minerals thus the enriched oxygen isotopes within the minerals could have leached into the groundwater second the carbonated groundwater with high co2 partial pressure could have been exposed to the surface environment which in turn would have undergone degassing process the relatively depleted oxygen isotopes would have diffused into the atmosphere first which in turn enriched groundwater isotopes koh et al 2002 kim 2010 there are possible provenances of co2 in groundwater with three types mantle degassing biogenic decomposition in the soil and metamorphic devolatilization of carbonate minerals jeong et al 2005 koh et al 2008 many researchers have studied the origins of co2 in the carbonated groundwater by using various geochemical tools based on Œ¥13c and log pco2 partial pressure calculations tables a2 and a5 the co2 provenance in these study sites were regarded to be from a deep mantle origin koh et al 2002 jeong et al 2005 koh et al 2008 fig 7 a shows cw plots with constant Œ¥18o value but Œ¥13c is distributed at 3 to 10 range it was considered that the former reflects site specific characteristics owing to geologic minerals and the latter reflects evidence of mantle origin co2 mixture clark and fritz 1997 fig 7 b presents consistent total dissolved solids tds concentration for each site and co2 partial pressure log pco2 spreading 0 03 to 0 49 range the tds value is generally controlled by water rock interaction such as geology flow velocity and residence time g√ºler and thyne 2004 meanwhile the cj 1 sample in the dotted circle of fig 7 b is lower than the reference pco2 of cw log pco2 over 0 50 but it does not show significant tds and Œ¥18o differences this phenomenon seems to be related to the reflection of site specific characteristics implied through the tds concentration and the implication of meteoric water origin through Œ¥18o data kim 2007 average ph and tds of cw samples have proportional relations in fig 7 c the bugang samples had the highest tds 1614 mg l and chojeong the lowest tds 329 mg l but ph was 6 12 and 5 6 respectively showed approximately 0 5 order difference the cause is ascribed to weak acidic ph 5 09 6 72 of the cw samples not providing enough acceleration for the tds concentration increase through water rock interaction 4 3 carbonated reservoir estimation to predict co2 leakage process the carbonated groundwater had reached three component equilibrium by undergoing hydrochemical reactions with the groundwater body bedrock minerals and dissolved co2 therefore the phreeqc model with the geologic consideration can reflect the gas water rock interactions in the actual groundwater system when co2 leakage occurs from the gcs sites 4 3 1 temperature estimation of cw reservoir using geothermometer the chalcedony geothermometer can be applied to groundwater of granite area and sedimentary rock region to estimate the reservoir temperature which was equilibrated with sio2 species kharaka et al 1977 michard et al 1986 calculated temperatures using eq 1 which is the chalcedony geothermometer are presented in table 2 these results can be further applied to estimate reservoir depth by multiplying average temperature and geothermal gradient values especially calculated temperature range distribute from 43 08 to 83 13 c which are in accordance with the geothermal groundwater of these study sites blavoux et al 1982 are reported the Œ¥13c values of co2 from deep origin such as mantle and magma having 8 0 to 4 0 range in comparison with this cw samples present the Œ¥13c range between 8 0 and 3 2 table a4 based on the Œ¥13c and geothermometer results the cw sites of this study can be assumed to evolve from the tw reservoir by mixing of mantle co2 gases geothermometer is applied to the geothermal groundwater in the volcanic area rather than carbonated groundwater due to the silicate minerals highly sensitive to temperature arnorsson 1975 giggenbach 1988 choi 2002 when carbonated groundwater is compared with thermal water excessive sio2 can be released from bedrock minerals after the dissolution of co2 thus calculated reservoir depths using geothermometer can be slightly overestimated on the other hand average temperatures of the cw samples are distributed at a range of 8 77 to 17 55 c which is expected from a cw reservoir at a shallower depth than a tw aquifer in addition koh and chae 2008 reported that the mean residence time mrt of the soda springs in chungcheong province the southern part of korea had turned out to have a shorter residence time than the tw samples of 15 50 years the tritium analysis study by vuataz and goff 1986 suggested the cold springs of jemez mountain the northern part of new mexico to have 20 75 years of mrt despite consisting of meteoric water they estimated the short mrt because of mixing among deep thermal fluids near surface groundwater and relatively old but cold groundwater therefore there is another possibility in the mixing process such as gw and cw mixing but there are many complex factors to consider in binary mixing such as mixing ratio or end member decision for that reason this study focuses on the cw evolution at the deep reservoirs 300 m 700 m as path 1 and the shallow reservoirs below 300 m as path 2 while excluding the mixing of gw 4 3 2 phreeqc simulations of hydrochemical change with co2 mixing the carbonation modeling of the tw and gw samples at hot spring sites gives the information on the hydrochemical changes of deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs during the carbonation processes in comparison with the hot spring concept the gw at the chojeong site can be used to predict the changes of the shallow reservoirs located directly under the soda spring site the groundwater velocity was assumed to be slow enough less than reynold number 10 to apply the darcy s laws and there is sufficient time between the groundwater and the introduced co2 to achieve chemical equilibriumsimilar to the closed batch condition the abovementioned geothermometer calculations were applied to the phreeqc simulation parkhurst and appelo 2013 and geochemist s workbench student edition bethke and yeakel 2009 this modeling process conjectured that different pressure and temperature conditions accommodate different co2 solubility for each condition 0 0001 10 mol l 1 of co2 was introduced to simulate the changes of the two water groups which are the tw with higher temperature and pressure 50 71 c 32 76 atm and the gw with lower temperature and pressure 13 22 c 6 25 atm the gw of chojeong varied from ca mg hco3 to ca hco3 type fig 8 a in comparison the water properties of the tw of the inland sites suanbo yuseong and deoksan changed from alkali bicarbonate type na hco3 to earth alkaline with prevailing bicarbonate type ca hco3 due to co2 intrusion fig 8 b d f co2 partial pressure is calculated to be below 0 5 when 0 01 mol l 1 to 0 1 mol l 1 of co2 is intruded into the reservoir but if 0 1 mol l 1 of co2 flow into the groundwater carbonating process sufficiently appears in all tw sites with ca hco3 type the gw samples of these sites increase in the ca and hco3 proportion from ca na hco3 type fig 8 c e g the introduced co2 concentration increases following the direction of the dotted arrow the gw of suanbo yuseong and deoksan show carbonated water conditions under 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 mixing which is lower than tw transition point it can be accounted for the fact that tw samples have higher alkalinities and higher buffer capacity table a1 the interactive formula for the buffer capacity is as follows stumm and morgan 1996 9 co 2 aq h 2 o h 2 co 3 aq h hco 3 induce ph decreasing 10 dissolved hco 3 ground water released h h 2 co 3 aq ph buffer the tw and gw samples of the seokmodo coastal site have high na cl and ca so4 ratios as earth alkaline water bodies have high concentrations of so4 or cl the tw is changed to earth alkaline water with hco3 type but the gw move to alkaline water with hco3 type due to differences in cation behavior fig 8 h and i the piper diagram shows only major ionic ratios thus the determination of carbonated water has to be checked using hco3 ion concentration in relation to co2 moles fig 9 shows the changes of the dissolved ion concentration in accordance with the co2 intrusion per each site the chojeong gw simulation showed that si ion and so4 ion increase but also ca ion decreases fig 9 a in the inland tw ca and hco3 ion concentrations increase but so4 ion decreases when the moles of co2 increase fig 9 b d f likewise the inland gw increases ca so4 and hco3 ion concentration but na ions and k ions decrease along with co2 concentration fig 9 c e g it is inferred that co2 mixing accelerates a catalytic water rock interaction also when the mixing reaction occurs secondary minerals can be precipitated into the reservoir coastal tw starts to change water quality with 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 which is higher concentration compared with the inland tw samples fig 9 h and i it is considered that high salinity of various ion species dissolved in the coastal groundwater is crucial factor to restrain the change of water quality see fig a1 5 conclusion to discover the details of the leaked co2 plume induced carbonating process of groundwater with the various depth this natural analogue study was carried out at the geothermal groundwater tw sites and the carbonated groundwater cw sites the tw samples show consistent water type of na hco3 in inland areas suanbo yuseong and deoksan and na cl in a coastal area seokmodo the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o data of the inland tw indicated that the meteoric water has different isotopic values depending on the altitude infiltrated into the thermal aquifer the Œ¥14c data of the tw samples collected from deep aquifer revealed long residence times the cw samples showed ca hco3 type regardless of seasonal variations but the cw of chojeong has been found to be partially mixed with shallow groundwater gw the dissolved inorganic carbon of the cw appeals to be affected not by dissolution of carbonate minerals but by the mantle degassing process owing to the Œ¥13c range based on the hydrochemical analysis the study sites of the tw and the cw were considered to be adequately closed systems thus it is reasonable to consider them as the batch conditions for the simulation of the carbonating processes using the phreeqc model the chalcedony geothermometer was considered suitable for application on groundwater equilibrated with sio2 in the granite area and the sedimentary bedrock region such as the ones found on the study sites the reservoir temperatures of the cw sites have been estimated to range between 43 08 and 83 13 c which are similar temperature range with the tw sites in addition to these results reservoir depths km can estimate reservoir temperature c divide by geothermal gradient c per km also the calculated reservoir depths of the study sites indicate the geothermal groundwater flowed out from the above zone monitoring interval azmi which depth is 400 m to 700 m below surface level b s l on the other hand cw samples were monitored to be in 3 8 18 7 c range and 263 7 488 7 mv of redox potential which mean shallow reservoirs can be taken into account in the gw carbonating process therefore two possibilities can be considered to explain the carbonated reservoir of cw samples one is the deeper reservoirs 300 700 m b s l from the chalcedony geothermometer and geothermal gradient calculation and the other is the shallower reservoirs below 300 m b s l from the temperature and redox potential data in a bid to simulate the carbonating processes of deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs using the phreeqc model pco2 of groundwater data exceeds 0 5 in the inland tw and gw more than 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 respectively during the co2 mixing ca and hco3 ions increase but so4 decreases in inland tw samples and ca so4 and hco3 increase in inland gw samples at the same time na and k ions decrease the coastal tw can be reflecting the carbonating process of the coastal azmi section containing large quantities of salts the carbonation of these samples is triggered by 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 introduced into reservoir but the na cl water type was kept the anion ratios of coastal water have changed due to hco3 increase but cations were still consisted of high na and k ratio during simulation the concentrated salts in the coastal groundwater are considered to increase the buffer capacity to respond to the co2 mixing this study focuses on both deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs which identically have a ca hco3 type with carbonated condition despite that they have undergone different ionic variations furthermore if the same amount of co2 is mixed gw will be reached through a faster carbonated condition based on all gw data temperature range of discharge water from tw reservoir was thought to coincide with in situ cw samples due to the uplift cooling in order to hypothesize a more realistic carbonation condition

7224,this study monitored four geothermal groundwater tw wells suanbo yuseong deoksan and seokmodo four carbonated groundwater cw springs chojeong bugang shin and bangadari and shallow groundwater gw in order to interpret the carbonating process from the seepage of co2 in a bid to figure out the carbonated reservoir where co2 mixing occurs the cw samples represent the condition of the final carbonated water as natural analogues the initial fresh water can be assumed to be the following depth the deep aquifer with 300 700 m below the surface level b s l and the shallow aquifer to be below 300 m b s l the pairs of hydrogen Œ¥2h and oxygen Œ¥18o isotopes indicated that all the groundwater samples had been recharged from meteoric water at various heights the Œ¥14c data of the tw samples present residence time from 1980 30 to 6400 30 years bp before present and the Œ¥13c data of dissolved inorganic carbon in the cw distributed from 3 to 10 range implying the mantle degassing effects regardless of seasonal variations the tw samples and the cw samples were shown to be the na hco3 type and the ca hco3 type respectively indicating these aquifers remain in closed conditions based on the chalcedony geothermometer results the carbonated reservoir of the cw samples were estimated to range between 43 08 and 83 13 c which were paired with the average temperature of the tw sites in turn the reservoir depth estimations taken by multiplying temperatures by geothermal gradients were estimated to range between 1 34 km and 3 90 km meanwhile the in situ data of the cw sites were estimated to range between 3 8 and 18 7 c and between 263 7 and 488 7 mv of redox potential of oxidizing condition which means there are the possibilities of shallow carbonated reservoir in order to delineate the hydrochemical changes of the fresh groundwater during carbonation at a deep reservoir and a shallow reservoir the phreeqc modeling was conducted with 0 0001 10 mol l 1 of co2 mixing as the co2 concentrations increased the tw and the gw displayed different ionic variations but the inland groundwater identically moved to the ca hco3 type the coastal tw can be reflecting the carbonation process of the coastal azmi section containing large quantities of salts the carbonation of these samples is triggered by 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 introduced into the reservoir but it still retained the na cl water type despite a log pco2 of over 0 5 the study results imply that there can be deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs responsible for developing carbonated groundwater it will be useful to estimate hydrochemical variations of groundwater resulting from the natural artificial co2 leakage keywords geothermal groundwater carbonated groundwater carbonating process natural analogue reservoir depth 1 introduction among various carbon capture and sequestration ccs technologies the geologic carbon storage gcs is accepted as one of the most feasible techniques the gcs is the technique injecting co2 into inland or coastal geologic medium in depths of about 800 m to 1000 m below surface level b s l metz et al 2005 benson and cole 2008 doe 2011 the stored co2 is supposed to be retained in reservoirs for a long time more than 99 of the injected co2 will be maintained for more than 1000 years and the acceptable leakage level has been suggested as less than 0 1 of storage volume per year harvey et al 2012 song and zhang 2012 miocic et al 2013 however when the co2 leakage from reservoir is above the acceptable level the water quality of the upper aquifer can be degraded due to the accelerated water rock interaction by the intruded co2 gas kharaka et al 2009 zoback and gorelick 2012 moreover once the excess co2 plume is leaked into the atmosphere through the preferential flow path such as fault or fracture it could result in human inhalation problems depending on the concentration and exposure time sch√ºtze et al 2012 gasparini et al 2016 therefore the gcs sites should be monitored intensively and regularly to track the movement of the injected co2 plume in reservoirs and to detect the hydrochemical changes in the aquifer above the cap rock terwel et al 2011 wallquist et al 2012 liebscher et al 2013 if the excess co2 plumes intrude into the aquifer above the cap rock the pressure will most likely rise or the hydrochemistry will change regardless of the masking effect of the other geologic matrix lewicki et al 2007 vishal and singh 2016 hovorka et al 2011 measured pressure change to detect the co2 leakage with a baseline monitoring in the deep aquifer which was called as above zone monitoring interval azmi the azmi section placed in the 400 m to 700 m below surface level b s l has the advantage of receiving minimal impact from artificial factors and facilitate an immediate response to physicochemical reactions occurring in the event of co2 leakage from reservoirs kharaka et al 2009 song and zhang 2012 tao et al 2013 jenkins et al 2015 consequently monitoring and identifying the changes in the physicochemical conditions of the azmi section will be an effective option for early leakage detection at the ccs sites however in the stage of developing gcs facility without any direct injection and monitoring practice understanding of potential reactions of leaked co2 with groundwater in various natural conditions is indispensable to predict and evaluate the risk for example the natural analogue studies on geothermal groundwater hot spring and carbonated groundwater soda spring could provide information on the background condition of the azmi and co2 intruded aquifers wilkinson et al 2009 kaszuba et al 2011 becker and lynds 2012 gal et al 2012 sch√ºtze et al 2012 do et al 2017 accordingly several studies have been performed to monitor the groundwater systems with stable conditions and to predict the gcs impact by the co2 injection wilkinson et al 2009 reported geochemical changes of groundwater from the analogue site near the sea using the variation of ion species and stable c and o isotopes gilfillan et al 2011 monitored he ne gases and c isotope in the natural co2 rich spring and groundwater to trace the co2 source where deeper mantle origin or shallower gcs reservoir origin gal et al 2012 monitored gases such as co2 222rn and 4he from the soil and water in the natural analogue site to figure out spatial influence of gas leakage under the ground and to suggest mixing processes as leakage from gcs site this study will focus on the hydrogeochemical data of geothermal groundwater tw carbonated groundwater cw and shallow non carbonated groundwater gw to construe the natural data as a part of the carbonating process fig 1 shows a schematic diagram related to the two possible pathways of the cw development from fresh groundwater one is the deep reservoir located in the azmi section path 1 and the other is the shallow reservoir located in the 50 m to 250 m b s l path 2 2 geological background fig 2 shows the location and the geology of the monitoring sites and their detailed descriptions are as follows kim and choi 1998 2 1 geology of geothermal groundwater sites this study conducted the tw monitoring from two geologic groups one group is suanbo and yuseong sites in the okcheon metamorphic belt region and the other group is deoksan and seokmodo sites in the mesozoic granite region fig 2 a to d the depth of the tw wells ranged from 300 m to 700 m b s l similar to the azmi depth of the gcs these sites are known for high geothermal gradient which originated from the decay energy of radioisotopes such as u th k etc lee et al 1998 kim 2007 the suanbo geothermal site is located on the seochangni formation of the okcheon metamorphic belt alternately composed of dark gray colored phyllite and black shale kim and lee 1965 the yuseong site consists mainly of jurassic two mica granite and schistose granite of hyangsan ri formation intruded quartz porphyry and quartz veins park et al 1977 the deoksan site is mainly consisted of jurassic daebo granite over gayabong and sangwangsan area shin et al 1989 the seokmodo site has bedrocks of precambrian metamorphic rock and mesozoic biotite granite intruded hornblende granodiorite along the southwest coast and also tw monitoring well is located on the biotite granite region hwang and kihm 2005 suanbo yuseong and deoksan sites are located in the inland area whereas seokmodo site is located in the coastal area within 500 m from the beachfront 2 2 geology of carbonated groundwater sites the cw in the study sites are generally produced from the fault zone along the geological boundaries fig 2 e to h the bedrocks of chojeong site consist of age unknown arenaceous phyllite layer and metasedimentary rocks of the okcheon metamorphic belt lee and kim 1971 the bugang site shows bedrocks of age unknown two mica schist crossing to the southwest direction and jurassic granites kwon and jin 1974 jurassic granites are composed of porphyritic granite and biotite granite with various directions of foliation the shin and bangadari sites are located close to each other approximately 2 km in distance and have the same geologic background of the precambrian gneiss intruded by age unknown gneiss jurassic sedimentary layer and mesozoic granite cheong et al 1975 jeong et al 2005 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analysis for hydrochemical elements this study conducted seasonal monitoring on the tw gw and the surface water sw of the suanbo yuseong deoksan and seokmodo sites and the cw and the sw in the chojeong bugang shin and bangadari sites from july 2013 to may 2015 it should be noted that the chojeong site coincided with the gw collection table 1 shows brief geographic and hydrogeologic information of the study sites since the hydrogeochemical data will give information on inherent aquifer characteristics at different depths at the sampling sites the in situ measurements including temperature ph electric conductivity ec and redox potential eh were taken laboratory analysis was performed on cations ca k mg na si sr rb anions f cl br no3 so4 hco3 and stable isotopes 13c 18o and 2h alkalinity titration

separately collected in polypropylene bottles for cation anion alkalinity oxygen hydrogen isotopes and kept in the refrigerator under 4 c for chemical analyses the cation samples were acidified with concentrated nitric acid to lower the ph to less than 2 for stable carbon isotope sampling target water was injected into a 10 4 torr vacuum glass bottle 100 ml volume bottle filled with 10 ml phosphoric acid by using a pre cleaned syringe with 0 45 Œºm pore filter for co2 gas production capasso et al 2005 the radiocarbon samples were collected through 1l hdpe bottles using flow cells to prevent mixing with atmospheric carbon gases then the samples were treated with 10 ml of naoh solution and 2 ml of bacl2 solution in an anaerobic chamber to obtain dic dissolved inorganic carbon precipitation in baco3 form the naoh and the bacl2 solutions were purged by reacting with n2 gas one day before the field experimentation in order to eliminate the dissolved co2 gas the cations and anions were analyzed using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8300 perkin elmer and the ion chromatography ic metrohm 883 basic ic plus at the hydrogeology laboratory at yonsei university the oxygen Œ¥18o and the hydrogen Œ¥2h isotopes of the water samples were analyzed using the stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry s irms gv instruments limited with 0

analyzed using the irms delta v plus thermo scientific germany with 0 1 precision relative to the pee dee belemnite pdb reference at the korea basic science institute in ochang the baco3 samples for radiocarbon dating Œ¥14c were combusted to transform graphite by means of an elemental analyzer with fe catalyst and hydrogen gas at 600 c these samples were measured at the kigam korea institute of geosciences and mineral resources through the accelerator mass spectrometer ams system with pelletized graphite samples 3 2 simulating hydrochemical variation of groundwater on the co2 intrusion to evaluate potential changes in water chemistry when groundwater reacts with dissolved co2 under various pressure and temperature conditions this study simulated different hydrochemical variations using a geochemical inverse model the phreeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 which calculates the solubility of gases in the high pressure condition peng and robinson 1976 the simulations follow equilibrium reactions among co2 water mineral phases according to the temperature pressure and groundwater composition the aquifer pressure through the geologic matrix was related to the pressure condition of groundwater system as increasing 10 bar per 100 m b s l perrin et al 2009 wertz et al 2013 the unit conversion was conducted for the pressure unit of 1 bar in order to calculate with 1 atm about 1 01 bar fig 3 shows the experimental temperature and calculated pressure conditions of the deep aquifer 50 71 c 32 76 atm as a path 1 and the shallow aquifer 13 22 c 6 25 atm as a path 2 which are suggested in fig 1 for the modeled condition this study set the minimum and the maximum concentrations of co2 from 0 0001 to 10 mol l 1 intruded into the non carbonated reservoir these models could provide the analyses on reservoir depth of carbonated groundwater as well as the chemical changes of non carbonated groundwater by co2 intrusion by using the phreeqc with equilibrium phases and reaction calculation on each site 3 3 estimating carbonate reservoir using geothermometer some dissolved elements are sensitive to temperature for precipitation or dissolution during water rock interaction accordingly a geothermometer was used to estimate the ion species from the reservoir temperature of the formed groundwater and there are two assumptions for the geothermometer calculations the first assumption is that temperature indicating elements have been formed through the hydrochemical equilibrium at the reservoir and the second assumption is that no mixing or dilution occurred when the groundwater rose to the surface arnorsson 1975 giggenbach 1988 choi 2002 even though the reservoir temperature estimation of cw by geothermometer still poses a challenge many studies have attempted to do geothermometer application thomas et al 2016 applied the chalcedony silica geothermometer to estimate the subsurface temperature in volcanic areas of iceland with temperatures of 110 c and higher choi 2002 studied the co2 rich groundwater of gangwon province in korea to calculate the carbonated reservoir temperature of the na hco3 type groundwater ranging between 140 and 160 c based on the thermodynamic calculation and empirical formula from the islandic geothermal groundwater fournier 1977 arn√≥rsson et al 1983 the silica geothermometer could be applied to low temperature reservoir estimation under 200 c edmiston and benoit 1984 at the islandic volcanic rock region chalcedony and quartz maintains equilibrium with groundwater at temperatures 20 to 110 c and above 180 c arnorsson 1975 the chalcedony geothermometer suggested by fournier 1977 can be applied 0 250 c temperature range and temperature equation is the following 1 estimated reservoir temperature c 1032 4 69 log s 273 15 where s means sio2 concentration mg kg michard et al 1986 reported that the groundwater ranging between 70 and 140 c reaches the equilibrium state with both quartz and chalcedony at a granite rock region meanwhile kharaka et al 1977 reported that in a sedimentary rock region groundwater below 70 c equilibrates with chalcedony and that above 70 c equilibrates with quartz thus this study applied the chalcedony geothermometer to simulate the changes of the carbonated groundwater at the tw sites 4 results and discussion 4 1 field measurement data table a1 specified the groundwater and surface water data of the tw sites the average temperatures of the tw of deoksan and seokmodo remained steady at 48 5 and 71 c respectively meanwhile the suanbo tw retained a consistent average temperature of 53 0 c sa 1 to sa 6 see table a1 but showed a large difference of approximately 6 c in sa 7 despite eh uniformity it is considered that gw sas 5 temperature 12 c could be mixed from the maintenance construction in the nearby stream the suanbo yuseong and deoksan tw showed weak alkaline properties with ph 7 91 8 88 the ph range of coastal tw and seokmodo varies from 6 44 to 6 11 which classify as weakly acidic to neutral the seokmodo tw was reported as sea water intruded tw lee et al 2011 and it can also be confirmed by the total dissolved solids tds value of measured field data approximately 21 000 23 000 mg l the seokmodo tw showed lower alkalinity of 35 25 36 89 mg l despite being affected by sea water intrusion alkalinity 113 11 mg l as caco3 these results indicate that the tw was influenced relatively more by gw alkalinity 18 85 mg l as caco3 and surface water than sea water during the mixing process redox potential eh of the seokmodo tw ranged between 88 7 and 102 1 mv implying reducing condition nordstrom and wilde 2005 in the suanbo site and the yuseong site the transitional conditions of 255 1 276 6 mv and 247 3 mv indicated the mixing of surface water table a2 represents the groundwater and surface water data of the cw sites eh of the cw samples ranged from 263 7 to 488 7 mv implying oxidizing condition this oxidizing condition can be interpreted as the electron pair exchange reactions between the dissolved oxygen within the cw and mineral of the bedrock mcbride 1994 stumm and morgan 1996 based on the findings by previous studies in korea koh et al 2002 choi 2002 jeong et al 2005 koh et al 2008 this study regarded the samples over 0 5 log pco2 as carbonated groundwater and those below 0 7 log pco2 as non carbonated groundwater the co2 partial pressure for the cj 1 sample was 1 28 which was especially low compared with other carbonated waters showing partial pressures from 0 03 to 0 49 the unusually low co2 partial pressure was attributed to the mixing of shallow non carbonated groundwater resulted from excessive pumping which in turn induced ph increase and co2 partial pressure decrease choi 2002 choi et al 2005 log pco2 in tables a1 and a2 present the values calculated using the phreeqc version 3 3 temperatures of the bugang cw site and the bangadari cw site were found to be relatively consistent however the sh 4 and sh 5 samples from the shin spring show especially low temperature that the sample was potentially exposed to the atmosphere during the sampling process the ec values for the cw samples ranged from 130 Œºs cm to 1600 Œºs cm and these observations are higher than those of the gw and the sw at each site the ec differences could be originating from

and 0 15 of h2co3 phase 4 2 hydrochemical characteristics of geothermal and carbonated groundwaters 4 2 1 hydrochemical evolution fig 4 presents the gw plots and the sw plots of the tw and the cw sites major ion compositions of all samples are presented in tables a3 and a4 in fig 4 a the tw samples have na hco3 type as seen inside black solid lines and identified as alkaline water with prevailing hco3 ravikumar et al 2015 the gw samples red plots in fig 4 a show similar chemical properties to sw as earth alkaline water with prevailing hco3 which may infer that permanent stream sw consists of dominant gw contribution fetter 2000 the dotted circle located on the upper right of the piper diagram fig 4 a indicates the seokmodo samples from coastal areas they show a markedly higher na cl ratio compared to other water bodies this means that anion ratios for the seokmodo samples are maintained consistently at approximately 90 5 5 ratios for cl so4 hco3 whereas the na ratio in sea water was approximately 80 and showed a high concentration of cations on the contrary the ca ratios have an increasing trend from approximately 45 to 60 in the ascending order of geothermal groundwater surface water and shallow groundwater the cw samples have normal earth alkaline water with prevailing hco3 type especially the bugang shin and bangadari sites were categorized as ca hco3 type maintaining a consistent chemical composition regardless of seasonal climate changes fig 4 b and table a4 on the other hand the carbonated groundwater in the chojeong site was categorized as ca na hco3 type the plots inside the black dotted circle in fig 4 b are for the sh 6 and ba 6 samples showing the large increase of na ratio but the decrease of ca and mg ratio this possibly resulted from the influence of summer tourists getting into the surface water next to the sampling site 4 2 2 sea water intrusion in coastal area cl and br ion concentrations are generally low in groundwater and these elements are strongly conservative accordingly these ions have been used as the indicators of sea water intrusion or anthropogenic influence hem 1991 fetter 2000 fig 5 a shows the br cl ratio of the seokmodo samples with the reference line for the sea water ratio of sea water 0 003 drawn by dotted line the fact that all samples were plotted close to the reference line indicated that sea water mixing is a dominant process they may be categorized into two groups depending on the mixing ratio one is the sw and gw group type i and the other is the tw group type ii which is classified based on the degree of mixing dependence fig 5 b reveals the na cl ratio variation due to ion exchange via the intruding sea water recent sea water intrusion would be expected to decrease the na cl ratio of the advancing front in fig 5 b and c the type ii water group is situated between the dashed lines of sea water and the type i group but the dotted line indicating mixing shows a curved formation that implies the influence of cation exchange from water rock interactions the chemical equations for the reactions are as follows kim et al 2003 4 2 na or k ca x 2 2 na or k x ca 2 5 2 na or k mg x 2 2 na or k x mg 2 where x refers to ion exchange sites in the aquifer matrix in fig 5 d type i and type ii are clearly separated by chemical properties the general na cl molar ratio for sea water is known as 0 85 richter and kreitler 1993 bear et al 1999 meanwhile the molar ratio of the seokmodo samples were calculated as 0 70 for sea water 0 54 for geothermal groundwater 0 38 for surface water and 0 29 for shallow groundwater table a3 thus it seems to be affected by the mixing with fresh water and by the exchange reactions between na ions and ca mg ions within bedrock minerals fig 5 d shows that shallow groundwater has high ca mg so4 molar ratio compared to sea water this is because halite nacl deposits are often mixed with gypsum caso4 2h2o and anhydrite caso4 beds richter and kreitler 1993 mg2 is usually replaced in the position of ca2 which is why these minerals frequently exhibit admixtures of magnesium sulfates therefore the molar ratios of ca mg so4 versus na cl might be able to estimate sea water and fresh water interaction 4 2 3 isotopes related to groundwater evolution 4 2 3 1 stable isotopes 18o 2h and 13c of tw the oxygen hydrogen isotope composition from the south korean precipitation at the iaea wmo station pohang presented the local meteoric water line lmwl as Œ¥2h 8 06Œ¥18o 12 87 lee and kim 2007 the global meteoric water line gmwl proposed by rozanski et al 1993 was Œ¥2h 8 13Œ¥18o 10 8 fig 6 all water samples except those from coastal sites are plotted from 7 to 11 for Œ¥18o and 50 to 75 for Œ¥2h fig 6 indicating the water bodies of the deep reservoir and the shallow reservoir gw of the study sites originated from meteoric water in fig 6 a and d oxygen hydrogen isotopes values cluster in a relatively small range for both tw and cw samples reflecting their unique water rock reaction characteristics by referencing the altitude data on table 1 and fig 6 b isotopes become deplete with the altitude rising of the geothermal groundwater sites indicating that precipitation infiltrated into the deep aquifers without significant isotope fractionations on the other hand the seokmodo isotopes equation in fig 6 a is calculated Œ¥2h 6 13Œ¥18o 6 77 r2 0 95 and its slope is lower than that of the lmwl with 8 06 the d value d Œ¥2h 8Œ¥18o less than 10 indicates an evaporative enrichment of river water lee and kim 2007 the low correlation of seokmodo samples with the lmwl is attributed to vapor mass formed continuously and early stages of precipitation were reflected kim 2010 in the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o diagram the seokmodo water samples aligned to the sea water value and the tw Œ¥18o 4 39 to 4 50 and Œ¥2h 30 5 to 35 6 were more enriched than the gw table a5 because deeper groundwater wells are more affected by the intrusion of isotopically heavy sea water fetter 2000 13c analysis can be utilized to distinguish respiration and metabolic processes of microbe reactions with atmosphere and carbonates and determining for the inflow of deep origin co2 maher et al 2015 kim 2010 becker and lynds 2012 during the study period Œ¥13c values of the suanbo deoksan and seokmodo tw samples table a5 remained at 11 93 0 31 17 40 0 26 15 73 0 68 respectively the Œ¥13c values of these sites including yuseong Œ¥13c 18 0 are implied by the impacts of freshwater carbonates and organic materials clark and fritz 1997 4 2 3 2 radioactive carbon isotope 14c of tw in order to estimate the residence time of the hot spring sites this study carried out 14c analysis on the tw and gw samples the netpath adjustment modeling plummer et al 1994 was conducted to correct the ams results simulating 14c residence time of the total dissolved carbon tdc based on 14c pmc values time decay and carbon isotope mass balance equation are as follows plummer et al 1994 suckow et al 2013 6 Œ¥ t years 5730 ln 2 ln a nd a 7 Œ¥ rm dic rdii r Œ± i sdo i the modern half life of a 14c is 5730 years and is the initial 14c content pmc value after

solution the sa 7 ys 1 ds 7 sm 7 sag ysg dsg and smg samples collected in april 2015 were used for radiocarbon dating the deviation between the ams measured value and the adjusted netpath value showed relatively small differences of approximately 100 years following calibrations the age of water bodies in each study area ranged as follows seokmodo 6400 years suanbo 5580 years yuseong 1980 years and deoksan 3240 years bp before present present means 1950s table a5 the gw and the tw have a relationship of depth to residence time with the following formula 8 pmc percent modern carbon 0 06 depth 98 r 2 0 93 it was interpreted that the longer flow path of meteoric water would result in the development of high temperature geothermal groundwater on the other hand the deoksan shallow groundwater has a value indicating that mixing with present water such as surface water godwin 1962 fetter 2000 suckow et al 2013 4 2 3 3 stable isotopes 18o 2h and 13c of cw the oxygen hydrogen isotopes of the cw samples are clustered in the right side of the lmwl fig 6 c and d this phenomenon was interpreted to have resulted from two factors first the dissolved co2 might have accelerated water rock interactions between groundwater and bedrock minerals thus the enriched oxygen isotopes within the minerals could have leached into the groundwater second the carbonated groundwater with high co2 partial pressure could have been exposed to the surface environment which in turn would have undergone degassing process the relatively depleted oxygen isotopes would have diffused into the atmosphere first which in turn enriched groundwater isotopes koh et al 2002 kim 2010 there are possible provenances of co2 in groundwater with three types mantle degassing biogenic decomposition in the soil and metamorphic devolatilization of carbonate minerals jeong et al 2005 koh et al 2008 many researchers have studied the origins of co2 in the carbonated groundwater by using various geochemical tools based on Œ¥13c and log pco2 partial pressure calculations tables a2 and a5 the co2 provenance in these study sites were regarded to be from a deep mantle origin koh et al 2002 jeong et al 2005 koh et al 2008 fig 7 a shows cw plots with constant Œ¥18o value but Œ¥13c is distributed at 3 to 10 range it was considered that the former reflects site specific characteristics owing to geologic minerals and the latter reflects evidence of mantle origin co2 mixture clark and fritz 1997 fig 7 b presents consistent total dissolved solids tds concentration for each site and co2 partial pressure log pco2 spreading 0 03 to 0 49 range the tds value is generally controlled by water rock interaction such as geology flow velocity and residence time g√ºler and thyne 2004 meanwhile the cj 1 sample in the dotted circle of fig 7 b is lower than the reference pco2 of cw log pco2 over 0 50 but it does not show significant tds and Œ¥18o differences this phenomenon seems to be related to the reflection of site specific characteristics implied through the tds concentration and the implication of meteoric water origin through Œ¥18o data kim 2007 average ph and tds of cw samples have proportional relations in fig 7 c the bugang samples had the highest tds 1614 mg l and chojeong the lowest tds 329 mg l but ph was 6 12 and 5 6 respectively showed approximately 0 5 order difference the cause is ascribed to weak acidic ph 5 09 6 72 of the cw samples not providing enough acceleration for the tds concentration increase through water rock interaction 4 3 carbonated reservoir estimation to predict co2 leakage process the carbonated groundwater had reached three component equilibrium by undergoing hydrochemical reactions with the groundwater body bedrock minerals and dissolved co2 therefore the phreeqc model with the geologic consideration can reflect the gas water rock interactions in the actual groundwater system when co2 leakage occurs from the gcs sites 4 3 1 temperature estimation of cw reservoir using geothermometer the chalcedony geothermometer can be applied to groundwater of granite area and sedimentary rock region to estimate the reservoir temperature which was equilibrated with sio2 species kharaka et al 1977 michard et al 1986 calculated temperatures using eq 1 which is the chalcedony geothermometer are presented in table 2 these results can be further applied to estimate reservoir depth by multiplying average temperature and geothermal gradient values especially calculated temperature range distribute from 43 08 to 83 13 c which are in accordance with the geothermal groundwater of these study sites blavoux et al 1982 are reported the Œ¥13c values of co2 from deep origin such as mantle and magma having 8 0 to 4 0 range in comparison with this cw samples present the Œ¥13c range between 8 0 and 3 2 table a4 based on the Œ¥13c and geothermometer results the cw sites of this study can be assumed to evolve from the tw reservoir by mixing of mantle co2 gases geothermometer is applied to the geothermal groundwater in the volcanic area rather than carbonated groundwater due to the silicate minerals highly sensitive to temperature arnorsson 1975 giggenbach 1988 choi 2002 when carbonated groundwater is compared with thermal water excessive sio2 can be released from bedrock minerals after the dissolution of co2 thus calculated reservoir depths using geothermometer can be slightly overestimated on the other hand average temperatures of the cw samples are distributed at a range of 8 77 to 17 55 c which is expected from a cw reservoir at a shallower depth than a tw aquifer in addition koh and chae 2008 reported that the mean residence time mrt of the soda springs in chungcheong province the southern part of korea had turned out to have a shorter residence time than the tw samples of 15 50 years the tritium analysis study by vuataz and goff 1986 suggested the cold springs of jemez mountain the northern part of new mexico to have 20 75 years of mrt despite consisting of meteoric water they estimated the short mrt because of mixing among deep thermal fluids near surface groundwater and relatively old but cold groundwater therefore there is another possibility in the mixing process such as gw and cw mixing but there are many complex factors to consider in binary mixing such as mixing ratio or end member decision for that reason this study focuses on the cw evolution at the deep reservoirs 300 m 700 m as path 1 and the shallow reservoirs below 300 m as path 2 while excluding the mixing of gw 4 3 2 phreeqc simulations of hydrochemical change with co2 mixing the carbonation modeling of the tw and gw samples at hot spring sites gives the information on the hydrochemical changes of deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs during the carbonation processes in comparison with the hot spring concept the gw at the chojeong site can be used to predict the changes of the shallow reservoirs located directly under the soda spring site the groundwater velocity was assumed to be slow enough less than reynold number 10 to apply the darcy s laws and there is sufficient time between the groundwater and the introduced co2 to achieve chemical equilibriumsimilar to the closed batch condition the abovementioned geothermometer calculations were applied to the phreeqc simulation parkhurst and appelo 2013 and geochemist s workbench student edition bethke and yeakel 2009 this modeling process conjectured that different pressure and temperature conditions accommodate different co2 solubility for each condition 0 0001 10 mol l 1 of co2 was introduced to simulate the changes of the two water groups which are the tw with higher temperature and pressure 50 71 c 32 76 atm and the gw with lower temperature and pressure 13 22 c 6 25 atm the gw of chojeong varied from ca mg hco3 to ca hco3 type fig 8 a in comparison the water properties of the tw of the inland sites suanbo yuseong and deoksan changed from alkali bicarbonate type na hco3 to earth alkaline with prevailing bicarbonate type ca hco3 due to co2 intrusion fig 8 b d f co2 partial pressure is calculated to be below 0 5 when 0 01 mol l 1 to 0 1 mol l 1 of co2 is intruded into the reservoir but if 0 1 mol l 1 of co2 flow into the groundwater carbonating process sufficiently appears in all tw sites with ca hco3 type the gw samples of these sites increase in the ca and hco3 proportion from ca na hco3 type fig 8 c e g the introduced co2 concentration increases following the direction of the dotted arrow the gw of suanbo yuseong and deoksan show carbonated water conditions under 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 mixing which is lower than tw transition point it can be accounted for the fact that tw samples have higher alkalinities and higher buffer capacity table a1 the interactive formula for the buffer capacity is as follows stumm and morgan 1996 9 co 2 aq h 2 o h 2 co 3 aq h hco 3 induce ph decreasing 10 dissolved hco 3 ground water released h h 2 co 3 aq ph buffer the tw and gw samples of the seokmodo coastal site have high na cl and ca so4 ratios as earth alkaline water bodies have high concentrations of so4 or cl the tw is changed to earth alkaline water with hco3 type but the gw move to alkaline water with hco3 type due to differences in cation behavior fig 8 h and i the piper diagram shows only major ionic ratios thus the determination of carbonated water has to be checked using hco3 ion concentration in relation to co2 moles fig 9 shows the changes of the dissolved ion concentration in accordance with the co2 intrusion per each site the chojeong gw simulation showed that si ion and so4 ion increase but also ca ion decreases fig 9 a in the inland tw ca and hco3 ion concentrations increase but so4 ion decreases when the moles of co2 increase fig 9 b d f likewise the inland gw increases ca so4 and hco3 ion concentration but na ions and k ions decrease along with co2 concentration fig 9 c e g it is inferred that co2 mixing accelerates a catalytic water rock interaction also when the mixing reaction occurs secondary minerals can be precipitated into the reservoir coastal tw starts to change water quality with 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 which is higher concentration compared with the inland tw samples fig 9 h and i it is considered that high salinity of various ion species dissolved in the coastal groundwater is crucial factor to restrain the change of water quality see fig a1 5 conclusion to discover the details of the leaked co2 plume induced carbonating process of groundwater with the various depth this natural analogue study was carried out at the geothermal groundwater tw sites and the carbonated groundwater cw sites the tw samples show consistent water type of na hco3 in inland areas suanbo yuseong and deoksan and na cl in a coastal area seokmodo the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o data of the inland tw indicated that the meteoric water has different isotopic values depending on the altitude infiltrated into the thermal aquifer the Œ¥14c data of the tw samples collected from deep aquifer revealed long residence times the cw samples showed ca hco3 type regardless of seasonal variations but the cw of chojeong has been found to be partially mixed with shallow groundwater gw the dissolved inorganic carbon of the cw appeals to be affected not by dissolution of carbonate minerals but by the mantle degassing process owing to the Œ¥13c range based on the hydrochemical analysis the study sites of the tw and the cw were considered to be adequately closed systems thus it is reasonable to consider them as the batch conditions for the simulation of the carbonating processes using the phreeqc model the chalcedony geothermometer was considered suitable for application on groundwater equilibrated with sio2 in the granite area and the sedimentary bedrock region such as the ones found on the study sites the reservoir temperatures of the cw sites have been estimated to range between 43 08 and 83 13 c which are similar temperature range with the tw sites in addition to these results reservoir depths km can estimate reservoir temperature c divide by geothermal gradient c per km also the calculated reservoir depths of the study sites indicate the geothermal groundwater flowed out from the above zone monitoring interval azmi which depth is 400 m to 700 m below surface level b s l on the other hand cw samples were monitored to be in 3 8 18 7 c range and 263 7 488 7 mv of redox potential which mean shallow reservoirs can be taken into account in the gw carbonating process therefore two possibilities can be considered to explain the carbonated reservoir of cw samples one is the deeper reservoirs 300 700 m b s l from the chalcedony geothermometer and geothermal gradient calculation and the other is the shallower reservoirs below 300 m b s l from the temperature and redox potential data in a bid to simulate the carbonating processes of deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs using the phreeqc model pco2 of groundwater data exceeds 0 5 in the inland tw and gw more than 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 respectively during the co2 mixing ca and hco3 ions increase but so4 decreases in inland tw samples and ca so4 and hco3 increase in inland gw samples at the same time na and k ions decrease the coastal tw can be reflecting the carbonating process of the coastal azmi section containing large quantities of salts the carbonation of these samples is triggered by 0 01 mol l 1 of co2 introduced into reservoir but the na cl water type was kept the anion ratios of coastal water have changed due to hco3 increase but cations were still consisted of high na and k ratio during simulation the concentrated salts in the coastal groundwater are considered to increase the buffer capacity to respond to the co2 mixing this study focuses on both deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs which identically have a ca hco3 type with carbonated condition despite that they have undergone different ionic variations furthermore if the same amount of co2 is mixed gw will be reached through a faster carbonated condition based on all gw data temperature range of discharge water from tw reservoir was thought to coincide with in situ cw samples due to the uplift cooling in order to hypothesize a more realistic carbonation condition selection of mixing components and mixing ratio should be considered in future studies acknowledgements this research was supported by the energy efficiency resources core technology program of the
