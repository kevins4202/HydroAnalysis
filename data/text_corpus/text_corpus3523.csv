17615,perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa an emerging and persistent pollutant could cause toxicity effects on aquatic organisms however this was generally assessed under high exposure concentrations of pfoa and nutrient enriched conditions which was not accordant with the actual environments therefore to comprehensively understand the toxicity effects of pfoa on aquatic organisms the cellular responses of microalgae chlorella pyrenoidosa to pfoa under different concentrations 1 0 mg l and nutrient conditions were investigated in this study results show that pfoa at concentrations less than 1 0 mg l had no significant effects on algal growth and chlorophyll contents and no oxidative damages were generated to destroy membrane integrity and morphology however n p limited and starved conditions significantly decreased algal growth and chlorophyll contents and induced oxidative stresses to ruin the structure and function of cell membrane moreover the deficiency of p had more severe negative effect on algae than that of n and they both influenced the toxicity responses of microalgae to 1 0 mg l pfoa the adsorption and uptake percentages of pfoa by algal cells were both less than 10 and increased adsorption but decreased uptake of pfoa amounts occurred under n p limited and starved conditions these findings will be useful to understand the toxicity effects of pfoa on microalgae in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctanoic acid chlorella pyrenoidosa cellular responses nutrient conditions toxicity 1 introduction perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is a kind of classic perfluorinated compounds pfcs which consists of a hydrophobic fluorinated alkyl chain and a hydrophilic end group pfcs are widely used in industry and household as surfactants flame retardants coatings carpets and food packing paper due to their thermal and chemical stability oxidative resistance and high surface activity gagliano et al 2020 although main producers in america and europe have phased out the production of pfcs they are still widely detected in rivers li et al 2020 drinking water li et al 2019 wastewater houtz et al 2016 even in human blood poothong et al 2020 and breast milk jin et al 2020 owing to their persistence in environments and strong resistance to biodegradation du et al 2014 the concentrations of pfcs have been usually determined in the range of ng l to μg l in natural waters and pg g to ng g in soils sediments and human bodies arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 lundquist et al 2019 numerous studies have declared that pfcs including pfoa were toxic to animals li et al 2017 plants chen et al 2020 and microbes cerro gálvez et al 2020 moreover aquatic environments can be a potential sink for pfcs owing to their virtually impossible volatilization from water to air gagliano et al 2020 thus the presence of pfcs in natural environments especially water bodies might be a potential threat to ecological safety and human health as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems microalgae play an important role in the energy transfer to organisms at higher tropic levels through food chains xu et al 2013 moreover microalgae are one of the ideal ecological indicators to assess water quality and ecotoxicity of various pollutants due to their short generation time and high sensitivity to aquatic pollution sanchez et al 2015 to date the toxicity effects of pfoa and related pfcs on microalgae were intensively assessed by researchers giesy et al 2010 however the toxicity assessments of pfoa on microalgae were mainly investigated under high exposure concentrations which ranged from several tens to hundreds mg l hu et al 2014 xu et al 2013 for instance pfoa at 10 40 mg l significantly inhibited the growth of chlamydomonas reinhardtii hu et al 2014 and 15 180 mg l pfoa obviously decreased the chlorophyll concentrations of selenastrum capricornutum xu et al 2013 these assessments were out of reality because pfoa concentrations in natural water were usually in ng l to μg l range gebbink et al 2017 for example pfoa was detected from 1 28 ng l to 24 7 μg l in rivers around bohai sea of china chen et al 2017 only several specific water bodies had higher concentrations of pfoa at low mg l lundquist et al 2019 for instance pfoa concentrations ranged from 0 6 to 1 7 mg l in wastewater affected by fire fighting activity at a military air base site of south australia arias e et al 2015 thus the toxicity effects of pfoa on microalgae need to be evaluated under a lower concentration compared with that reported in previous studies on the other hand the nutrient concentrations especially nitrogen n and phosphorus p vary greatly in different aquatic environments in some water bodies especially affected by agricultural activities their nutrient concentrations were frequently detected at excess levels causing the rapid growth of phytoplankton to form eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 however for lakes and rivers in good ecological status their nutrient concentrations were always in the levels of low mg l for total n and μg l for total p respectively poikane et al 2019 for instance the concentrations of total n and total p were 0 25 4 mg l and 50 500 μg l in lakes 0 25 35 mg l and 8 660 μg l in rivers across europe poikane et al 2019 the different nutrient concentrations in surface waters were expected to affect the toxicity of pollutants on microalgae kong et al 2010 miao and wang 2006 which found by a previous study that the starvation of n and p decreased the toxicity of naphthalene on chlorella vulgaris kong et al 2010 however little information about the cellular responses of microalgae to pfoa under different nutrient conditions especially in the lakes and rivers in good ecological status could be obtained thus the cellular responses of microalgae to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions were investigated in this study chlorella pyrenoidosa c pyrenoidosa one of the ubiquitous and dominant green microalgae in freshwater environments was selected as the model microalgae in this study due to its frequent use as a model organism in aquatic ecotoxicity study xu et al 2013 and its potential ability to remove different environmental contaminants and produce bioenergy or other high value products sutherland and ralph 2019 microalgal responses to pfoa at cellular level were focused on the growth physiology and membrane property of algal cells furthermore the adsorption and uptake of pfoa by algal cells were also studied the findings of this study will provide a practical perspective into the ecotoxicity of pfoa on microalgae in aquatic environments at various ecological status 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and algae culture pfoa 98 was purchased from tci development co ltd shanghai china stock solution of pfoa was prepared in deionized water at 100 mg l working solutions of pfoa were obtained through

solution etc were all analytical grade or better the freshwater microalgae c pyrenoidosa fachb 5 was purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china the microalgae were cultivated with 100 ml sterile blue green medium bg11 ph 7 1 0 2 in autoclaved 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks li et al 2010 the cultivation was conducted in an illumination incubator with light intensity of 120 μmol m2 s at 14 h photoperiod and the temperature was maintained at 23 1 c the algal solutions were shaken continuously at 150 rpm to maintain homogenous and periodically inoculated to keep the algal cells in the logarithmic growth phase for following experiments all cultivation and experiments were carried out under sterile conditions 2 2 concentration and nitrogen phosphorus dependent exposure experiments to evaluate the cellular responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa exposure experiments were carried out under different pfoa concentrations and nutrient conditions according to oecd guidelines with test conditions oecd 2011 concentration dependent responses were tested with 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 mg l pfoa under n p enriched condition where n and p were dosed in the form of nano3 and k2hpo4 and their concentrations were the standard levels of bg11 medium n 247 4 mg l p 7 1 mg l the treatment without dosing pfoa was set as the control nutrient dependent responses were performed with 0 and 1 0 mg l pfoa under n p limited or starved conditions the n p limited conditions contained 2 474 mg l n or 0 071 mg l p 1 of the standard levels of n or p in bg11 medium which could represent the nutrient levels in the lakes and rivers at good ecological status poikane et al 2019 the n p starved conditions were conducted without n or p or both where the concentrations of n or p were 0 mg l for n p limited or starved experiments pre incubated algal cells were washed three times with the corresponding medium to clean the residual n and p algal cells cultivated without dosing pfoa under the corresponding n p limited or starved conditions were set as the controls respectively the initial cell density was controlled at 1 0 106 cells ml which was calculated from the standard curve between cell density y 106 cells ml and a690 x made with a hemocytometer slide under a light microscope y 10x 0 205 r 2 0 9969 all treatments were conducted in triplicate the exposure period was set as 10 days to ensure the enough exponential growth of c pyrenoidosa and to explore its chronic toxicity responses to pfoa after 10 days exposure cell density dry biomass chlorophyll content malondialdehyde mda content catalase cat and peroxidase pod activities and cell membrane property of algae were measured to investigate the toxicity responses to pfoa according to previous studies kong et al 2010 xu et al 2013 2 3 assays of chlorophyll lipid peroxidation and enzyme activities for analysis of chlorophyll contents algal

spectrophotometer at 665 649 and 470 nm uv2600 shimadzu japan lichtenthaler and wellburn 1983 mda in algal cells was extracted with 0 1 trichloroacetic acid w v and assayed with 2 thiobarbituric acid tba reaction kong et al 2010 briefly the extracted solution contained mda was mixed with 0 5 tba w v and then kept in 100 c water bath for 20 min after quickly cooled in 4 c ice bath the supernatants were determined at 450 532 600 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer crude enzymatic extracts were obtained through freeze thawing cycle of algal cells in 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 8 cat activity was spectrophotometrically determined to record the absorbance decline at 240 nm due to the oxidation of h2o2 gallego et al 1996 after 3 v v h2o2 was dosed to the reaction medium contained enzyme extract the a240 was immediately recorded for a total of 2 min pod activity was also monitored with a uv vis spectrophotometer at 470 nm based on the catalytic oxidation of guaiacol by h2o2 and enzyme yin et al 2008 the absorbance at 470 nm was immediately monitored after the enzyme extract was added to the reaction medium contained 3 v v h2o2 and 1 w v guaiacol solution one unit of cat or pod activity was defined as the decline of 0 01 in a240 or 0 1 in a470 per minute respectively 2 4 analysis of membrane integrity and morphology of algal cells the membrane integrity was measured according to the cellular fluorescence stained with propidium iodide using a flow cytometer facs aria iii bd biosciences usa equipped with an argon laser 488 nm propidium iodide a fluorescent dye could pass through the damaged cell membrane and integrate with nucleic acids to produce red fluorescence 535 nm excitation 615 nm emission sanchez et al 2015 after 10 days exposure algal cells were collected by centrifugation 5000 rpm 10 min washed with phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7 0 for three times and then stained with propidium iodide 10 mg l for 20 min in dark the fluorescence intensity of the damaged algal cells was determined with pe channel 585 42 nm the fluorescence detection sensitivity for pe channel in flow cytometry used in this study was lower than 125 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome at least 10 000 algal cells were collected for each sample and the data analysis was conducted with software flowjo v10 flowjo llc ashland or usa the surface morphology of algal cells was observed using scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss evo 18 germany briefly algal cells after exposure experiments were collected and prefixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution for 24 h at 4 c then fixed again in 1 osmium tetroxide solution for 2 h after washing three times with phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7 0 after fixation algal cells were dehydrated gradually with different concentrations of ethanol 30 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 100 v v finally algal cells were dropped on copper sheet air dried gold sprayed and observed using sem 2 5 pfoa analysis pfoa concentration in solution pfoa amounts of adsorption and uptake by algal cells were analyzed according to a previous study with some modifications hu et al 2014 briefly at the end of the exposure experiments 25 ml algal solution was collected through centrifugation 10 000 rpm 10 min and the supernatant was sampled to analyze the concentration of pfoa in solution the algal pellets were re dispersed in 5 ml deionized water to mix sufficiently following collected by centrifugation 10 000 rpm 10 min the washing of algal cells was conducted for three times for enough desorption of pfoa from algae the amount of pfoa in the washing solutions was regarded as the adsorbed pfoa by algal cells the final precipitate was extracted with 10 ml dichloromethane and methanol v v 1 in a shaker for 24 h at 200 rpm 25 c the extracts were then centrifuged dried under nitrogen gas and re dissolved in 1 ml methanol for analyzing pfoa uptake by algal cells the determination of pfoa was performed using an agilent 1290 hplc system equipped with a sb c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 8 µm coupled to agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer the multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode was chose to detect pfoa with an electrospray source in negative ion mode the mobile phase solution was consisted of 5 mm ammonium acetate in milli q water a and acetonitrile b the elution of pfoa was conducted at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min with the following gradient mobile phase started with 10 b and held for 2 min then increased to 60 b in 1 min and increased to 95 b within 1 min and held for 2 min finally returned to 10 b in 0 1 min and equilibrated for 2 min the amounts of pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells were both expressed as μg g dry weight of algal biomass μg g dw the recoveries of pfoa in spiked algal samples ranged from 88 5 95 6 and the standard deviation was lower than 4 n 3 2 6 statistical analysis the results in this study were expressed as arithmetic means standard deviations of three replicates one way analysis of variance anova was used to perform the statistical analysis of the data among different treatments and significance level was set as 0 05 p 0 05 according to least significant difference lsd and duncan test ibm spss statistics 20 3 results 3 1 algal growth response to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions algal cell density and dry biomass were assayed to evaluate the growth response of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions fig 1 results show that algal cell densities gradually increased with exposure time prolonging under all treatments fig 1a c e for exposure to various concentrations of pfoa 1 0 mg l algal cells all developed in a classic exponential growth pattern fig 1a pfoa at concentrations less than 1 0 mg l had no significant inhibiting effects on algae reproduction which were confirmed by the similar algal dry biomass at various pfoa dosages after 10 days exposure fig 1b under n p limited and starved conditions algal growth was significantly inhibited compared to that under n p enriched condition fig 1c f furthermore dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa had no significant aggravated effect on algal cell density or dry biomass in comparison with those in corresponding controls under various nutrient conditions in addition whether exposed to 1 0 mg l pfoa algal growth under p limited condition was similar with that under n p limited condition which were both lower than that under n limited condition fig 1c d similarly under various n p starved conditions algal cell densities and dry biomass with or without dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa were in the order as follows n starved p starved n p starved fig 1e f these results suggest that p had more severe effects than n on algal growth under different nutrient conditions 3 2 chlorophyll contents response to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions chlorophyll contents were determined to investigate the effect of pfoa on algal photosynthesis under various concentrations and nutrient conditions fig 2 fig 2a demonstrates that different concentrations of pfoa 1 0 mg l had no significant effects on the contents of chlorophyll a and b chl a and chl b in algal cells which could be evidenced by the similar color of algal solutions among different groups inset in fig 2a however with or without 1 0 mg l pfoa n p limited and starved conditions all significantly decreased chlorophyll contents in algal cells compared to n p enriched condition and the color of algal solutions turned from dark green to light green and nearly white fig 2b c in addition there were no significant differences in chlorophyll contents between the treatments with or without 1 0 mg l pfoa under the same nutrient conditions fig 2b shows that n p limited and p limited conditions had more severe damage on chl a than chl b compared to n limited condition however p starved condition decreased chl a content rather than chl b content significantly compared to n p starved or n starved condition fig 2c these findings indicate that p also had greater effects on chl a than chl b in microalgae compared to n under different nutrient conditions 3 3 mda contents and cat pod activities response to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions in this study the effects of pfoa on mda contents and cat pod activities of c pyrenoidosa were also studied under various concentrations and nutrient conditions results display that pfoa at concentrations less than 1 0 mg l had no significant effect on mda contents and cat pod activities in c pyrenoidosa p 0 05 fig 3 a d g however mda contents and cat pod activities in c pyrenoidosa all significantly increased under n p limited and starved conditions compared to those under n p enriched condition with or without dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa fig 3 specifically mda contents in algal cells under n p limited conditions followed the order n p limited p limited n limited where similar order occurred for cat and pod activities fig 3b e h moreover dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa produced no significant differences in mda contents and antioxidase activities compared to the corresponding controls at various nutrient limited conditions however under n p starved conditions p starved condition induced the highest mda production and cat pod activities followed by n p starved and n starved conditions fig 3c f i in addition pfoa exposure under n p starved and n starved conditions significantly decreased mda contents and increased cat activity in c pyrenoidosa these results suggest that p had more serious oxidative damage effects on algal cells than n under different nutrient conditions whether exposed to 1 0 mg l pfoa furthermore n p starved conditions could alter the oxidative stress response of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa 3 4 membrane integrity and morphology response to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions membrane integrity one of the most important indictors to evaluate the healthy status of algal cells was investigated using flow cytometry the left and right regions of a flow cytometric histogram in figs 4 and 5 represented the percentages of intact and membrane damaged algal cells respectively these two regions were distinguished clearly based on the fluorescence emitted by c pyrenoidosa stained with propidium iodide compared to the control the percentages of membrane damaged algal cells had no significant changes after dosing pfoa at different concentrations 1 0 mg l p 0 05 fig 4 however the percentages of membrane damaged algal cells all significantly increased under n p limited and starved conditions compared to those under n p enriched condition with or without 1 0 mg l pfoa p 0 05 fig 5 compared to the corresponding controls dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa significantly decreased the percentages of membrane damaged cells under n p limited condition p 0 05 fig 5b while no significant changes occurred under other conditions p 0 05 fig 5 furthermore n limited condition caused similar membrane damage to algal cells with p limited condition p 0 05 fig 5b which were both significantly lower than those under n p limited condition p 0 05 fig 5b moreover n p starved conditions caused more severe membrane damage of algal cells than n p limited conditions with dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa and followed the order of n p starved n starved p starved p 0 05 fig 5 for instance the percentage of membrane damaged algal cells under n p limited condition was 11 7 0 9 with 1 0 mg l pfoa fig 5b which significantly increased to 16 6 1 1 with 1 0 mg l pfoa under n p starved condition p 0 0003 fig 5d surface morphology of algal cells was characterized using sem and images are presented in fig 6 algal cells exposed to different concentrations of pfoa 1 0 mg l all showed spherical shapes with smooth surfaces uniformly fig 6a e however significant alterations in shapes and morphology of algal cells were found under all n p limited and starved conditions fig 6f u moreover dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa did not induce further variations in algal morphology compared to the corresponding controls under various nutrient conditions on the whole the results of membrane integrity and morphology of algal cells examined by flow cytometry and sem illustrate that pfoa at concentrations less than 1 0 mg l had no obvious damage on cell membrane of c pyrenoidosa whereas n p limited and starved conditions all seriously destroyed the functional and structural integrities of algal cells with or without pfoa 3 5 pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells after 10 days exposure the distribution of pfoa between solution and algal cells were determined results show that the concentrations of residual pfoa in solution the amounts of pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells all increased significantly p 0 05 with increasing pfoa dosages table 1 for instance the amounts of pfoa uptake by algal cells increased from 6 11 to 65 22 μg g dw with pfoa dosages increasing from 0 05 to 1 0 mg l moreover there were no significant differences p 0 05 in the adsorption percentages of pfoa by algal cells at various pfoa dosages which were all less than 5 table 1 however the uptake percentages of pfoa by algal cells significantly p 0 05 decreased with increasing pfoa dosages which decreased from 6 48 to 3 21 with pfoa dosages increased from 0 05 to 1 0 mg l different nutrient conditions also significantly affected the distribution of pfoa between solution and algal cells table 1 results display that under n p limited and starved conditions the concentrations of residual pfoa in solution were all higher than those under n p enriched condition when algal cells were exposed to 1 0 mg l pfoa besides compared to n p enriched condition n p stressed conditions significantly increased the amounts of pfoa adsorption but decreased the amounts of pfoa uptake by algal cells except for uptake under p starved condition however the percentages of pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells all significantly decreased under n p limited and starved conditions compared to those under n p enriched condition table 1 moreover under p limited or starved condition the amounts of adsorption and uptake of pfoa by algal cells were higher than those under n limited or starved condition these results indicate that p had more significant effects than n in pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells under different nutrient conditions 4 discussion 4 1 pfoa less than 1 0 mg l had no significant toxicity effect on c pyrenoidosa in this study pfoa at the test concentrations 1 0 mg l had no significant negative effects on the cell density chlorophyll content membrane integrity and surface morphology of c pyrenoidosa and induced no significant oxidative damages in algal cells as expected these findings were different from previous studies in which significant decreases of chlorophyll content and cell density and increases of mda contents and antioxidase activities in microalgae were observed owing to their exposure to pfoa at higher concentrations 15 180 mg l hu et al 2014 xu et al 2013 besides exposure to high concentrations of pfoa 15 180 mg l could also affect the cell membrane function e g decreasing permeability through possible combination with membrane proteins xu et al 2013 these differences in algal responses to pfoa between this study and previous studies might derive from the lower exposure concentrations used in this work for the toxicity effect of pfoa on microalgae was concentration dependent hekster et al 2003 furthermore pfoa was free acid anions in solution gagliano et al 2020 electrostatic repulsion might play an important role in the adsorption and uptake of pfoa anion by negatively charged c pyrenoidosa 29 2 0 9 mv in bg11 medium consequently only a small fraction of pfoa 10 was adsorbed and ingested by algal cells which was difficult to produce obvious toxicity effect on c pyrenoidosa however considering the bioaccumulation and persistence of pfoa in algal cells as well as the possible transference to organisms at high trophic levels through food chains the potential risks of pfoa in aquatic ecosystem should also be considered seriously 4 2 n p conditions influenced the cellular responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa nutrient conditions especially n and p might affect the toxicity of pollutants on microalgae kong et al 2010 2011 it is well known that n and p are the most essential components of proteins and nucleic acids in cells and p also enable energy storage through atp polyphosphate and information delivery through posttranslational modification of proteins blank 2012 buchanan et al 2002 thus n p limited and starved conditions significantly inhibited algal growth induced oxidative damages destroyed cell membrane system and affected the cellular responses of c pyrenoidosa to 1 0 mg l pfoa moreover p had more serious negative effects than that of n on these physiological and biochemical responses in algal cells probably because p possessed the most diverse cellular functions blank 2012 on the one hand n p limited and starved conditions seriously inhibited the growth of algal cells but had no aggravated negative effects on the growth responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa the deficiency of p and n would inhibit the transcription of dna into rna and the translation of rna into proteins respectively berdalet et al 1994 latasa and berdalet 1994 therefore the limitation or starvation of n and or p might affect the biosynthesis of photosynthetic proteins and pigments through interfering the transcription and translation levels in cells rai et al 2017 following resulted in decreased chlorophyll contents and cell growth of c pyrenoidosa on the other hand n p limited and starved conditions changed the oxidative stress responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa the deficiency of n and or p could induce excess production of reactive oxygen species ros in cells çakmak et al 2015 resulting in the increased antioxidant enzyme activities e g catalase peroxidase and mda contents owing to the disruptive balance of ros production and elimination wu et al 2017 therefore the observed membrane damage under n p stressed conditions might be generated due to the membrane lipid peroxidation and abnormal formation of biomembrane dong et al 2013 kong et al 2010 except for the deficiency of n and or p pfoa could also induce ros production to cause additional oxidative damage in cells xu et al 2013 possibly due to the inhibition of complex i nadh dehydrogenase subunits in the electron transport chain li et al 2017 the limitation or starvation of n and or p would affect the composition of nadh and the electron flow in electron transport chain carstensen et al 2018 leading to the changed oxidative stress responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa in natural water bodies the concentrations of n and p are usually as low as mg l and μg l in the lakes and rivers at good ecological status poikane et al 2019 while they are excessive in the streams threatened by eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 considering the distinct toxicity fates of pfoa on microalgae under n p enriched and stressed conditions comprehensive toxicological evaluation of hazardous compounds on aquatic organisms should be investigated under different environmentally relevant conditions 4 3 n p conditions influenced the adsorption and uptake of pfoa by c pyrenoidosa in this study only small proportions of pfoa less than 10 in total were adsorbed and ingested by c pyrenoidosa as reported microalgae could ingest exogenous organic compounds via two major processes 1 bioadsorption onto the cell wall components or the excretive extracellular substances 2 bio uptake through the passive diffusion or active transport and then bound to intracellular compounds sutherland and ralph 2019 pfoa is a kind of hydrophobic and anionic compounds hydrophobicity was attractive for absorption but the electrostatic interaction between the anionic functional groups and the negatively charged algal cells was not favor for absorption sutherland and ralph 2019 therefore the absorption of pfoa by c pyrenoidosa was the competition of the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and results indicated that repulsion ultimately prevailed once adsorbed on the cell surface pfoa could interfere the integrity and permeability of cell membrane and then enter into the cells through passive diffusion sutherland and ralph 2019 the limited adsorption of pfoa ultimately resulted in limited uptake of pfoa by c pyrenoidosa pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells were influenced by various nutrient conditions possibly due to the serious destruction of algal structures and functions under n p limited and starved conditions compared to those under n p enriched condition significant increase in adsorption but decrease in uptake of pfoa amounts by algal cells were observed under n p limited and starved conditions table 1 the decreased membrane integrity and damaged morphology of algal cells under these nutrient conditions imply that the algae were in disordered growing status and viability the adsorption of pfoa by microalgae was a non metabolic process occurred on both living and non living algal cells while uptake of pfoa only appeared in living algal cells sutherland and ralph 2019 thus pfoa adsorption by c pyrenoidosa would increase owing to the increased roughness of cell surface while uptake of pfoa decreased due to the lessened viability of algal cells although only small proportions of pfoa were adsorbed and ingested by c pyrenoidosa the environmental risks of pfoa on aquatic organisms should still be concerned due to its bioaccumulation and biomagnification effects through the aquatic food chain moreover n p conditions could affect the adsorption and uptake fates of pfoa in algal cells more attentions should be paid to the integrated effects of pfoa bioaccumulation and nutrient concentrations in natural aquatic ecosystems whether in lakes and river with good ecological status or in eutrophication 5 conclusions the cellular responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa under different concentrations and nutrient conditions were investigated in this study results show that different concentrations of pfoa 1 0 mg l had no significant toxicity effects on c pyrenoidosa however the deficiency of n and or p induced serious oxidative damage and cell membrane abnormality in c pyrenoidosa and influenced the oxidative stress responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa moreover p had more severe negative effects than that of n on algal cells whether dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa c pyrenoidosa only adsorbed and ingested a small quantity of pfoa and n p limited and starved conditions increased the adsorption but decreased the uptake of pfoa amounts by algal cells as a result considering the low but persistent toxicity of pfoa on microalgae as well as the changed cellular responses of microalgae to pfoa under various nutrient conditions more concerns should be focused on the toxicity effects of pfoa in different aquatic ecosystems declaration of

virtually impossible volatilization from water to air gagliano et al 2020 thus the presence of pfcs in natural environments especially water bodies might be a potential threat to ecological safety and human health as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems microalgae play an important role in the energy transfer to organisms at higher tropic levels through food chains xu et al 2013 moreover microalgae are one of the ideal ecological indicators to assess water quality and ecotoxicity of various pollutants due to their short generation time and high sensitivity to aquatic pollution sanchez et al 2015 to date the toxicity effects of pfoa and related pfcs on microalgae were intensively assessed by researchers giesy et al 2010 however the toxicity assessments of pfoa on microalgae were mainly investigated under high exposure concentrations which ranged from several tens to hundreds mg l hu et al 2014 xu et al 2013 for instance pfoa at 10 40 mg l significantly inhibited the growth of chlamydomonas reinhardtii hu et al 2014 and 15 180 mg l pfoa obviously decreased the chlorophyll concentrations of selenastrum capricornutum xu et al 2013 these assessments were out of reality because pfoa concentrations in natural water were usually in ng l to μg l range gebbink et al 2017 for example pfoa was detected from 1 28 ng l to 24 7 μg l in rivers around bohai sea of china chen et al 2017 only several specific water bodies had higher concentrations of pfoa at low mg l lundquist et al 2019 for instance pfoa concentrations ranged from 0 6 to 1 7 mg l in wastewater affected by fire fighting activity at a military air base site of south australia arias e et al 2015 thus the toxicity effects of pfoa on microalgae need to be evaluated under a lower concentration compared with that reported in previous studies on the other hand the nutrient concentrations especially nitrogen n and phosphorus p vary greatly in different aquatic environments in some water bodies especially affected by agricultural activities their nutrient concentrations were frequently detected at excess levels causing the rapid growth of phytoplankton to form eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 however for lakes and rivers in good ecological status their nutrient concentrations were always in the levels of low mg l for total n and μg l for total p respectively poikane et al 2019 for instance the concentrations of total n and total p were 0 25 4 mg l and 50 500 μg l in lakes 0 25 35 mg l and 8 660 μg l in rivers across europe poikane et al 2019 the different nutrient concentrations in surface waters were expected to affect the toxicity of pollutants on microalgae kong et al 2010 miao and wang 2006 which found by a previous study that the starvation of n and p decreased the toxicity of naphthalene on chlorella vulgaris kong et al 2010 however little information about the cellular responses of microalgae to pfoa under different nutrient conditions especially in the lakes and rivers in good ecological status could be obtained thus the cellular responses of microalgae to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions were investigated in this study chlorella pyrenoidosa c pyrenoidosa one of the ubiquitous and dominant green microalgae in freshwater environments was selected as the model microalgae in this study due to its frequent use as a model organism in aquatic ecotoxicity study xu et al 2013 and its potential ability to remove different environmental contaminants and produce bioenergy or other high value products sutherland and ralph 2019 microalgal responses to pfoa at cellular level were focused on the growth physiology and membrane property of algal cells furthermore the adsorption and uptake of pfoa by algal cells were also studied the findings of this study will provide a practical perspective into the ecotoxicity of pfoa on microalgae in aquatic environments at various ecological status 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and algae culture pfoa 98 was purchased from tci development co ltd shanghai china stock solution of pfoa was prepared in deionized water at 100 mg l working solutions of pfoa were obtained through gradual dilution of the stock solution with algal culture medium other chemicals used in this study including dye propidium iodide glutaraldehyde trichloroacetic acid hydrogen peroxide guaiacol solution etc were all analytical grade or better the freshwater microalgae c pyrenoidosa fachb 5 was purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china the microalgae were cultivated with 100 ml sterile blue green medium bg11 ph 7 1 0 2 in autoclaved 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks li et al 2010 the cultivation was conducted in an illumination incubator with light intensity of 120 μmol m2 s at 14 h photoperiod and the temperature was maintained at 23 1 c the algal solutions were shaken continuously at 150 rpm to maintain homogenous and periodically inoculated to keep the algal cells in the logarithmic growth phase for following experiments all cultivation and experiments were carried out under sterile conditions 2 2 concentration and nitrogen phosphorus dependent exposure experiments to evaluate the cellular responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa exposure experiments were carried out under different pfoa concentrations and nutrient conditions according to oecd guidelines with test conditions oecd 2011 concentration dependent responses were tested with 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 mg l pfoa under n p enriched condition where n and p were dosed in the form of nano3 and k2hpo4 and their concentrations were the standard levels of bg11 medium n 247 4 mg l p 7 1 mg l the treatment without dosing pfoa was set as the control nutrient dependent responses were performed with 0 and 1 0 mg l pfoa under n p limited or starved conditions the n p limited conditions contained 2 474 mg l n or 0 071 mg l p 1 of the standard levels of n or p in bg11 medium which could represent the nutrient levels in the lakes and rivers at good ecological status poikane et al 2019 the n p starved conditions were conducted without n or p or both where the concentrations of n or p were 0 mg l for n p limited or starved experiments pre incubated algal cells were washed three times with the corresponding medium to clean the residual n and p algal cells cultivated without dosing pfoa under the corresponding n p limited or starved conditions were set as the controls respectively the initial cell density was controlled at 1 0 106 cells ml which was calculated from the standard curve between cell density y 106 cells ml and a690 x made with a hemocytometer slide under a light microscope y 10x 0 205 r 2 0 9969 all treatments were conducted in triplicate the exposure period was set as 10 days to ensure the enough exponential growth of c pyrenoidosa and to explore its chronic toxicity responses to pfoa after 10 days exposure cell density dry biomass chlorophyll content malondialdehyde mda content catalase cat and peroxidase pod activities and cell membrane property of algae were measured to investigate the toxicity responses to pfoa according to previous studies kong et al 2010 xu et al 2013 2 3 assays of chlorophyll lipid peroxidation and enzyme activities for analysis of chlorophyll contents algal cells were collected by centrifugation and extracted with 95 ethanol v v in dark after the algal cells completely turned white the supernatants were obtained and measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer at 665 649 and 470 nm uv2600 shimadzu japan lichtenthaler and wellburn 1983 mda in algal cells was extracted with 0 1 trichloroacetic acid w v and assayed with 2 thiobarbituric acid tba reaction kong et al 2010 briefly the extracted solution contained mda was mixed with 0 5 tba w v and then kept in 100 c water bath for 20 min after quickly cooled in 4 c ice bath the supernatants were determined at 450 532 600 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer crude enzymatic extracts were obtained through freeze thawing cycle of algal cells in 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 8 cat activity was spectrophotometrically determined to record the absorbance decline at 240 nm due to the oxidation of h2o2 gallego et al 1996 after 3 v v h2o2 was dosed to the reaction medium contained enzyme extract the a240 was immediately recorded for a total of 2 min pod activity was also monitored with a uv vis spectrophotometer at 470 nm based on the catalytic oxidation of guaiacol by h2o2 and enzyme yin et al 2008 the absorbance at 470 nm was immediately monitored after the enzyme extract was added to the reaction medium contained 3 v v h2o2 and 1 w v guaiacol solution one unit of cat or pod activity was defined as the decline of 0 01 in a240 or 0 1 in a470 per minute respectively 2 4 analysis of membrane integrity and morphology of algal cells the membrane integrity was measured according to the cellular fluorescence stained with propidium iodide using a flow cytometer facs aria iii bd biosciences usa equipped with an argon laser 488 nm propidium iodide a fluorescent dye could pass through the damaged cell membrane and integrate with nucleic acids to produce red fluorescence 535 nm excitation 615 nm emission sanchez et al 2015 after 10 days exposure algal cells were collected by centrifugation 5000 rpm 10 min washed with phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7 0 for three times and then stained with propidium iodide 10 mg l for 20 min in dark the fluorescence intensity of the damaged algal cells was determined with pe channel 585 42 nm the fluorescence detection sensitivity for pe channel in flow cytometry used in this study was lower than 125 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome at least 10 000 algal cells were collected for each sample and the data analysis was conducted with software flowjo v10 flowjo llc ashland or usa the surface morphology of algal cells was observed using scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss evo 18 germany briefly algal cells after exposure experiments were collected and prefixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution for 24 h at 4 c then fixed again in 1 osmium tetroxide solution for 2 h after washing three times with phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7 0 after fixation algal cells were dehydrated gradually with different concentrations of ethanol 30 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 100 v v finally algal cells were dropped on copper sheet air dried gold sprayed and observed using sem 2 5 pfoa analysis pfoa concentration in solution pfoa amounts of adsorption and uptake by algal cells were analyzed according to a previous study with some modifications hu et al 2014 briefly at the end of the exposure experiments 25 ml algal solution was collected through centrifugation 10 000 rpm 10 min and the supernatant was sampled to analyze the concentration of pfoa in solution the algal pellets were re dispersed in 5 ml deionized water to mix sufficiently following collected by centrifugation 10 000 rpm 10 min the washing of algal cells was conducted for three times for enough desorption of pfoa from algae the amount of pfoa in the washing solutions was regarded as the adsorbed pfoa by algal cells the final precipitate was extracted with 10 ml dichloromethane and methanol v v 1 in a shaker for 24 h at 200 rpm 25 c the extracts were then centrifuged dried under nitrogen gas and re dissolved in 1 ml methanol for analyzing pfoa uptake by algal cells the determination of pfoa was performed using an agilent 1290 hplc system equipped with a sb c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 8 µm coupled to agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer the multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode was chose to detect pfoa with an electrospray source in negative ion mode the mobile phase solution was consisted of 5 mm ammonium acetate in milli q water a and acetonitrile b the elution of pfoa was conducted at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min with the following gradient mobile phase started with 10 b and held for 2 min then increased to 60 b in 1 min and increased to 95 b within 1 min and held for 2 min finally returned to 10 b in 0 1 min and equilibrated for 2 min the amounts of pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells were both expressed as μg g dry weight of algal biomass μg g dw the recoveries of pfoa in spiked algal samples ranged from 88 5 95 6 and the standard deviation was lower than 4 n 3 2 6 statistical analysis the results in this study were expressed as arithmetic means standard deviations of three replicates one way analysis of variance anova was used to perform the statistical analysis of the data among different treatments and significance level was set as 0 05 p 0 05 according to least significant difference lsd and duncan test ibm spss statistics 20 3 results 3 1 algal growth response to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions algal cell density and dry biomass were assayed to evaluate the growth response of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions fig 1 results show that algal cell densities gradually increased with exposure time prolonging under all treatments fig 1a c e for exposure to various concentrations of pfoa 1 0 mg l algal cells all developed in a classic exponential growth pattern fig 1a pfoa at concentrations less than 1 0 mg l had no significant inhibiting effects on algae reproduction which were confirmed by the similar algal dry biomass at various pfoa dosages after 10 days exposure fig 1b under n p limited and starved conditions algal growth was significantly inhibited compared to that under n p enriched condition fig 1c f furthermore dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa had no significant aggravated effect on algal cell density or dry biomass in comparison with those in corresponding controls under various nutrient conditions in addition whether exposed to 1 0 mg l pfoa algal growth under p limited condition was similar with that under n p limited condition which were both lower than that under n limited condition fig 1c d similarly under various n p starved conditions algal cell densities and dry biomass with or without dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa were in the order as follows n starved p starved n p starved fig 1e f these results suggest that p had more severe effects than n on algal growth under different nutrient conditions 3 2 chlorophyll contents response to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions chlorophyll contents were determined to investigate the effect of pfoa on algal photosynthesis under various concentrations and nutrient conditions fig 2 fig 2a demonstrates that different concentrations of pfoa 1 0 mg l had no significant effects on the contents of chlorophyll a and b chl a and chl b in algal cells which could be evidenced by the similar color of algal solutions among different groups inset in fig 2a however with or without 1 0 mg l pfoa n p limited and starved conditions all significantly decreased chlorophyll contents in algal cells compared to n p enriched condition and the color of algal solutions turned from dark green to light green and nearly white fig 2b c in addition there were no significant differences in chlorophyll contents between the treatments with or without 1 0 mg l pfoa under the same nutrient conditions fig 2b shows that n p limited and p limited conditions had more severe damage on chl a than chl b compared to n limited condition however p starved condition decreased chl a content rather than chl b content significantly compared to n p starved or n starved condition fig 2c these findings indicate that p also had greater effects on chl a than chl b in microalgae compared to n under different nutrient conditions 3 3 mda contents and cat pod activities response to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions in this study the effects of pfoa on mda contents and cat pod activities of c pyrenoidosa were also studied under various concentrations and nutrient conditions results display that pfoa at concentrations less than 1 0 mg l had no significant effect on mda contents and cat pod activities in c pyrenoidosa p 0 05 fig 3 a d g however mda contents and cat pod activities in c pyrenoidosa all significantly increased under n p limited and starved conditions compared to those under n p enriched condition with or without dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa fig 3 specifically mda contents in algal cells under n p limited conditions followed the order n p limited p limited n limited where similar order occurred for cat and pod activities fig 3b e h moreover dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa produced no significant differences in mda contents and antioxidase activities compared to the corresponding controls at various nutrient limited conditions however under n p starved conditions p starved condition induced the highest mda production and cat pod activities followed by n p starved and n starved conditions fig 3c f i in addition pfoa exposure under n p starved and n starved conditions significantly decreased mda contents and increased cat activity in c pyrenoidosa these results suggest that p had more serious oxidative damage effects on algal cells than n under different nutrient conditions whether exposed to 1 0 mg l pfoa furthermore n p starved conditions could alter the oxidative stress response of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa 3 4 membrane integrity and morphology response to pfoa under various concentrations and nutrient conditions membrane integrity one of the most important indictors to evaluate the healthy status of algal cells was investigated using flow cytometry the left and right regions of a flow cytometric histogram in figs 4 and 5 represented the percentages of intact and membrane damaged algal cells respectively these two regions were distinguished clearly based on the fluorescence emitted by c pyrenoidosa stained with propidium iodide compared to the control the percentages of membrane damaged algal cells had no significant changes after dosing pfoa at different concentrations 1 0 mg l p 0 05 fig 4 however the percentages of membrane damaged algal cells all significantly increased under n p limited and starved conditions compared to those under n p enriched condition with or without 1 0 mg l pfoa p 0 05 fig 5 compared to the corresponding controls dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa significantly decreased the percentages of membrane damaged cells under n p limited condition p 0 05 fig 5b while no significant changes occurred under other conditions p 0 05 fig 5 furthermore n limited condition caused similar membrane damage to algal cells with p limited condition p 0 05 fig 5b which were both significantly lower than those under n p limited condition p 0 05 fig 5b moreover n p starved conditions caused more severe membrane damage of algal cells than n p limited conditions with dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa and followed the order of n p starved n starved p starved p 0 05 fig 5 for instance the percentage of membrane damaged algal cells under n p limited condition was 11 7 0 9 with 1 0 mg l pfoa fig 5b which significantly increased to 16 6 1 1 with 1 0 mg l pfoa under n p starved condition p 0 0003 fig 5d surface morphology of algal cells was characterized using sem and images are presented in fig 6 algal cells exposed to different concentrations of pfoa 1 0 mg l all showed spherical shapes with smooth surfaces uniformly fig 6a e however significant alterations in shapes and morphology of algal cells were found under all n p limited and starved conditions fig 6f u moreover dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa did not induce further variations in algal morphology compared to the corresponding controls under various nutrient conditions on the whole the results of membrane integrity and morphology of algal cells examined by flow cytometry and sem illustrate that pfoa at concentrations less than 1 0 mg l had no obvious damage on cell membrane of c pyrenoidosa whereas n p limited and starved conditions all seriously destroyed the functional and structural integrities of algal cells with or without pfoa 3 5 pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells after 10 days exposure the distribution of pfoa between solution and algal cells were determined results show that the concentrations of residual pfoa in solution the amounts of pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells all increased significantly p 0 05 with increasing pfoa dosages table 1 for instance the amounts of pfoa uptake by algal cells increased from 6 11 to 65 22 μg g dw with pfoa dosages increasing from 0 05 to 1 0 mg l moreover there were no significant differences p 0 05 in the adsorption percentages of pfoa by algal cells at various pfoa dosages which were all less than 5 table 1 however the uptake percentages of pfoa by algal cells significantly p 0 05 decreased with increasing pfoa dosages which decreased from 6 48 to 3 21 with pfoa dosages increased from 0 05 to 1 0 mg l different nutrient conditions also significantly affected the distribution of pfoa between solution and algal cells table 1 results display that under n p limited and starved conditions the concentrations of residual pfoa in solution were all higher than those under n p enriched condition when algal cells were exposed to 1 0 mg l pfoa besides compared to n p enriched condition n p stressed conditions significantly increased the amounts of pfoa adsorption but decreased the amounts of pfoa uptake by algal cells except for uptake under p starved condition however the percentages of pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells all significantly decreased under n p limited and starved conditions compared to those under n p enriched condition table 1 moreover under p limited or starved condition the amounts of adsorption and uptake of pfoa by algal cells were higher than those under n limited or starved condition these results indicate that p had more significant effects than n in pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells under different nutrient conditions 4 discussion 4 1 pfoa less than 1 0 mg l had no significant toxicity effect on c pyrenoidosa in this study pfoa at the test concentrations 1 0 mg l had no significant negative effects on the cell density chlorophyll content membrane integrity and surface morphology of c pyrenoidosa and induced no significant oxidative damages in algal cells as expected these findings were different from previous studies in which significant decreases of chlorophyll content and cell density and increases of mda contents and antioxidase activities in microalgae were observed owing to their exposure to pfoa at higher concentrations 15 180 mg l hu et al 2014 xu et al 2013 besides exposure to high concentrations of pfoa 15 180 mg l could also affect the cell membrane function e g decreasing permeability through possible combination with membrane proteins xu et al 2013 these differences in algal responses to pfoa between this study and previous studies might derive from the lower exposure concentrations used in this work for the toxicity effect of pfoa on microalgae was concentration dependent hekster et al 2003 furthermore pfoa was free acid anions in solution gagliano et al 2020 electrostatic repulsion might play an important role in the adsorption and uptake of pfoa anion by negatively charged c pyrenoidosa 29 2 0 9 mv in bg11 medium consequently only a small fraction of pfoa 10 was adsorbed and ingested by algal cells which was difficult to produce obvious toxicity effect on c pyrenoidosa however considering the bioaccumulation and persistence of pfoa in algal cells as well as the possible transference to organisms at high trophic levels through food chains the potential risks of pfoa in aquatic ecosystem should also be considered seriously 4 2 n p conditions influenced the cellular responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa nutrient conditions especially n and p might affect the toxicity of pollutants on microalgae kong et al 2010 2011 it is well known that n and p are the most essential components of proteins and nucleic acids in cells and p also enable energy storage through atp polyphosphate and information delivery through posttranslational modification of proteins blank 2012 buchanan et al 2002 thus n p limited and starved conditions significantly inhibited algal growth induced oxidative damages destroyed cell membrane system and affected the cellular responses of c pyrenoidosa to 1 0 mg l pfoa moreover p had more serious negative effects than that of n on these physiological and biochemical responses in algal cells probably because p possessed the most diverse cellular functions blank 2012 on the one hand n p limited and starved conditions seriously inhibited the growth of algal cells but had no aggravated negative effects on the growth responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa the deficiency of p and n would inhibit the transcription of dna into rna and the translation of rna into proteins respectively berdalet et al 1994 latasa and berdalet 1994 therefore the limitation or starvation of n and or p might affect the biosynthesis of photosynthetic proteins and pigments through interfering the transcription and translation levels in cells rai et al 2017 following resulted in decreased chlorophyll contents and cell growth of c pyrenoidosa on the other hand n p limited and starved conditions changed the oxidative stress responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa the deficiency of n and or p could induce excess production of reactive oxygen species ros in cells çakmak et al 2015 resulting in the increased antioxidant enzyme activities e g catalase peroxidase and mda contents owing to the disruptive balance of ros production and elimination wu et al 2017 therefore the observed membrane damage under n p stressed conditions might be generated due to the membrane lipid peroxidation and abnormal formation of biomembrane dong et al 2013 kong et al 2010 except for the deficiency of n and or p pfoa could also induce ros production to cause additional oxidative damage in cells xu et al 2013 possibly due to the inhibition of complex i nadh dehydrogenase subunits in the electron transport chain li et al 2017 the limitation or starvation of n and or p would affect the composition of nadh and the electron flow in electron transport chain carstensen et al 2018 leading to the changed oxidative stress responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa in natural water bodies the concentrations of n and p are usually as low as mg l and μg l in the lakes and rivers at good ecological status poikane et al 2019 while they are excessive in the streams threatened by eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 considering the distinct toxicity fates of pfoa on microalgae under n p enriched and stressed conditions comprehensive toxicological evaluation of hazardous compounds on aquatic organisms should be investigated under different environmentally relevant conditions 4 3 n p conditions influenced the adsorption and uptake of pfoa by c pyrenoidosa in this study only small proportions of pfoa less than 10 in total were adsorbed and ingested by c pyrenoidosa as reported microalgae could ingest exogenous organic compounds via two major processes 1 bioadsorption onto the cell wall components or the excretive extracellular substances 2 bio uptake through the passive diffusion or active transport and then bound to intracellular compounds sutherland and ralph 2019 pfoa is a kind of hydrophobic and anionic compounds hydrophobicity was attractive for absorption but the electrostatic interaction between the anionic functional groups and the negatively charged algal cells was not favor for absorption sutherland and ralph 2019 therefore the absorption of pfoa by c pyrenoidosa was the competition of the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and results indicated that repulsion ultimately prevailed once adsorbed on the cell surface pfoa could interfere the integrity and permeability of cell membrane and then enter into the cells through passive diffusion sutherland and ralph 2019 the limited adsorption of pfoa ultimately resulted in limited uptake of pfoa by c pyrenoidosa pfoa adsorption and uptake by algal cells were influenced by various nutrient conditions possibly due to the serious destruction of algal structures and functions under n p limited and starved conditions compared to those under n p enriched condition significant increase in adsorption but decrease in uptake of pfoa amounts by algal cells were observed under n p limited and starved conditions table 1 the decreased membrane integrity and damaged morphology of algal cells under these nutrient conditions imply that the algae were in disordered growing status and viability the adsorption of pfoa by microalgae was a non metabolic process occurred on both living and non living algal cells while uptake of pfoa only appeared in living algal cells sutherland and ralph 2019 thus pfoa adsorption by c pyrenoidosa would increase owing to the increased roughness of cell surface while uptake of pfoa decreased due to the lessened viability of algal cells although only small proportions of pfoa were adsorbed and ingested by c pyrenoidosa the environmental risks of pfoa on aquatic organisms should still be concerned due to its bioaccumulation and biomagnification effects through the aquatic food chain moreover n p conditions could affect the adsorption and uptake fates of pfoa in algal cells more attentions should be paid to the integrated effects of pfoa bioaccumulation and nutrient concentrations in natural aquatic ecosystems whether in lakes and river with good ecological status or in eutrophication 5 conclusions the cellular responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa under different concentrations and nutrient conditions were investigated in this study results show that different concentrations of pfoa 1 0 mg l had no significant toxicity effects on c pyrenoidosa however the deficiency of n and or p induced serious oxidative damage and cell membrane abnormality in c pyrenoidosa and influenced the oxidative stress responses of c pyrenoidosa to pfoa moreover p had more severe negative effects than that of n on algal cells whether dosing 1 0 mg l pfoa c pyrenoidosa only adsorbed and ingested a small quantity of pfoa and n p limited and starved conditions increased the adsorption but decreased the uptake of pfoa amounts by algal cells as a result considering the low but persistent toxicity of pfoa on microalgae as well as the changed cellular responses of microalgae to pfoa under various nutrient conditions more concerns should be focused on the toxicity effects of pfoa in different aquatic ecosystems declaration of

17616,feed spacer is universally used in spiral wound nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membrane modules it can separate membrane sheets create flow channels promote turbulence and enhance mass transfer however it also induces increased pressure drop across the flow channel and generates dead zones for biofilm growth at specific locations optimization of feed spacer geometries is highly desirable for energy saving and biofouling control in this study four kinds of commercial feed spacers featured with non uniform filaments were compared in terms of hydraulic and anti fouling performances computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were launched to give insights into the impacts of feed spacer characteristics on the flow field results show that the hydraulic performance was substantially affected by the number of filament layers single or dual layer the non uniformity of filament diameter and the width of thinning zones the design of single layer feed spacer of non uniform filaments was not recommended due to high flow resistance and poor anti fouling performance the feed spacer structure of alternating filament diameter contributed to reducing dead zones and alleviating membrane fouling the thinning zones located adjacent to the filament junctions achieved better anti fouling performance as it disturbed the dead zones and partially washed away the deposited foulants this study demonstrates for the first time that the characteristics of non uniform filament feed spacer had a crucial impact on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances and suggests that more emphasis should be laid on number of filament layers variation of filament diameter and width and positioning of thinning zones for the optimization of feed spacer geometries in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords feed spacer non uniform filaments hydraulic performance anti fouling computational fluid dynamics cfd 1 introduction spiral wound membrane swm modules of nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been widely applied in seawater desalination water treatment and wastewater reclamation hijnen et al 2012 an swm module is mainly composed of membrane sheets feed and permeate spacers and a central permeate tube schwinge et al 2004 membrane sheets are glued and rolled around the central permeate tube with feed spacers sandwiched between membrane sheets li and tung 2008 saeed et al 2012 the advantages of spiral wound nf ro modules lie in steady running small footprint and high efficiency and automation lin et al 2019 wang et al 2019 however swm modules in practical applications could also suffer from severe membrane fouling which decreases water productivity increases operating pressure and shortens membrane lifespan kostoglou and karabelas 2012 depending on foulant compositions membrane fouling is generally divided into four categories namely particulate and colloidal deposition organic fouling scaling and biofouling flemming et al 1997 nagaraj et al 2018 among these types of fouling biofouling eventually leading to the formation of biofilm is regarded as the most troublesome one because it is extremely difficult to be controlled and eliminated by pre treatment bereschenko et al 2011 saeed et al 2000 feed spacer is an essential part of swm modules which separates membrane sheets and creates flow channels as the turbulence promotor it can intensify flow turbulence enhance mass transfer and reduce concentration polarization cp bucs et al 2015 gao et al 2013 however the presence of feed spacer results in increase of feed channel pressure fcp drop and energy consumption of the membrane system especially when biofouling occurs for which fcp drop would be substantially increased by up to nearly fourfold of that with no biofouling ali et al 2019 dreszer et al 2014 vrouwenvelder et al 2009 furthermore water flow dead zones tend to develop near the intersections of spacer filaments where flow velocity slows and microorganisms have a propensity to adhere and form the biofilm vrouwenvelder et al 2009 therefore the design of feed spacer is targeted at enhancing mass transfer and lowering pressure drop as well as achieving better anti fouling performance kerdi et al 2018 miller et al 2012 rice et al 2018 ronen et al 2013 wibisono et al 2015 yang et al 2009 numerical simulations have been performed to study the impacts of feed spacer geometries on flow field cp and mass transfer guillen and hoek 2009 saeed et al 2015 as well as biofilm formation bucs et al 2014a radu et al 2014 experimental studies have also been conducted to uncover the difference in hydraulic and anti biofouling performances of various geometric feed spacers araújo et al 2012 siddiqui et al 2017a siddiqui et al 2017b valladares linares et al 2014 the most common commercial feed spacers are diamond shaped with cylindrical filaments intersected crosswise generally there are two types of filaments for the non woven feed spacers one having uniform thickness while the other having variable thickness along the filaments both kinds of feed spacers are universally applied in practice in spite of this fact many previous studies focused on the uniform filament feed spacers and very often the non uniform filaments were simplified as the uniform one in the numerical studies amigo et al 2018 foo et al 2020 gu et al 2017 katsandri 2017 koutsou et al 2009 li et al 2002a li and tung 2008 saeed et al 2015 saeed et al 2012 shakaib et al 2007 by far few studies have been conducted on the impacts of non uniform filament feed spacers characteristics on the performances of spacer filled channels the main objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of different characteristics of feed spacers featured with non uniform filaments on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances in the membrane channels we evaluated and compared four kinds of commercial feed spacers by conducting hydraulic and fouling experiments in a cross flow membrane system in addition computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were launched to validate the experimental results and provide insights into how non uniform filament feed spacer geometries e g number of filament layers variation of filament diameter and width and positioning of thinning zones affected the flow field to the best of our knowledge this is the first study devoted to reveal the impacts of non uniform filament feed spacers on the hydrodynamics and anti fouling performance in the spacer filled membrane channels via combining cfd simulation hydraulic tests and fouling experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed spacers four kinds of commercial feed spacers featured with non uniform filaments were investigated in this study three were provided by originwater company all with the dual layer structure of filaments named here as ndl meaning non uniform dual layer and the fourth was collected from a commercial spiral wound membrane module with the single layer structure of filaments named here as nsl meaning non uniform single layer the essential difference between ndl and nsl spacers lay in the number of filament layers single or dual layer all feed spacers were made of polypropylene pp the microscopic view and the detailed geometry parameters of the four feed spacers were presented in fig 1 and table 1 respectively the geometry parameters i e filament spacing variation of filament thickness and internal strand angle were measured by vernier caliper and protractor the feed spacers were similar in the overall diamond net shape inner strand angle 90 and spacer thickness 460 µm but differed in the filament spacing mesh size and the characteristics of filaments more specifically ndl spacers had non uniform cylindrical filaments but they differed in the varying rules of the filament diameter with the thinning zones of ndl0 ndl1 3 and ndl1 2 locating near the filament junctions 0 in the trisection 1 3 and in the half 1 2 of neighboring junctions of the filaments respectively nsl presented the largest mesh size and the greatest variation in alternating filament diameter in the filaments 2 2 experimental set up process and conditions a lab scale cross flow filtration set up fig s1 which consisted of four transparent flat sheet cells made of high pressure resisting acrylic glass was used to carry out the hydraulic tests and membrane fouling experiments the effective filtration area is 9 20 4 57 cm2 an nf membrane df30 originwater china was used in this study which had a molecular weight cut off of 400 da a mgso4 rejection of 98 2000 ppm and 4 8 bar a water permeability coefficient of 8 2 lmh bar and an optimal operating pressure of 1 0 5 0 bar lin et al 2020 the membrane and feed spacers were cut into coupons and soaked in ultrapure water for a minimum of 24 h and then placed into the cells and compacted under 5 0 bar the upper value of optimal operating pressure of df30 by filtering ultrapure water for 12 h after 12 h of compaction the pure water flux was stable and constant afterwards hydraulic tests were carried out with ultrapure water to evaluate the hydraulic performances of different spacer filled channels in which feed channel pressure fcp drop was measured using differential pressure transmitters ejx110a yokogawa electric corporation japan at various flow rates and permeate flux was determined using an electronic balance under varying applied pressure when the hydraulic tests were finished the feed tank was replenished with the synthetic feed solution for the fouling experiments short term biofouling studies with nutrient dosage can be well used to assess the anti biofouling performance of feed spacers siddiqui et al 2017a to facilitate the fouling rates in the short term fouling experiments the applied pressure was kept at the upper optimal operating pressure of 5 0 bar a strain of pseudomonas was firstly inoculated in the r2a culture medium for overnight 24 h incubation when od was 0 2 to enhance biofouling rate in the experiment the substrates containing sodium acetate sodium nitrate monosodium phosphate magnesium chloride and calcium chloride were added to provide essential nutrients for biofilm development with the dosage being 0 5 mg l mg2 0 5 mg l ca2 2 mg l c and a c n p mass ratio of 100 20 10 the ph value of the nutrient solution was adjusted to 10 by using sodium hydroxide in order to hinder the bacterial growth in the dosage vessel farhat et al 2015 the nutrient dosing flow rate 0 04 l h was low compared to the feed flow rate 36 l h which had a negligible impact on the ph of the feed solution 7 0 the feed solution was pumped into the four cells with the same inlet cross flow velocity of 0 12 m s and the concentrate was returned to the feed reservoir the permeate flux was measured using an electronic balance in the end of each fouling experiment replicate experiments were conducted for three times with a fouling period of five days for each time 2 3 autopsy of fouled membrane and feed spacer to investigate the impact of feed spacer geometries on the membrane fouling characteristics the coupons of membrane and feed spacer were taken out for autopsy after the fouling experiments previous studies suggested using both total organic carbon toc and adenosine triphosphate atp determination for the biomass quantification bucs et al 2014b as indicated in fig s2 six membrane pieces each with an area of 1 2 cm2 at locations close to the inlet the middle and the outlet of filtration cells were selected and cut for toc and atp measurements the organic fouling on the membrane spacer surface was characterized by toc measurement valladares linares et al 2014 firstly the pieces of membrane and feed spacer were cut off from the coupon secondly each of the fouled membrane and feed spacer was immersed in a 0 2 hcl solution ph 1 3 for 24 h separately after which 10 ml of 0 26 naoh solution was added into each of the previously used 0 2 hcl solutions equivalent to 0 1 naoh solution followed by a second 24 h soaking to enhance the effectiveness of foulants elution the soaking process was operated in a thermostatic shaker under 25 c and 150 rpm at last each eluate was filtered through 0 45 µm filters prior to toc determination toc level was calculated as total organic carbon per cm2 of membrane atp content was measured in order to estimate the accumulated biomass on the membrane spacer siddiqui et al 2017a each of the fouled membrane and spacer was cut up and put into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube thereafter the tubes were filled with 0 5 ml of sterilized physiological saline and vibrated using a vortex shaker for 3 min to extract the biomass into the solution the extraction process was repeated for three times the atp content in the extract was determined according to the fluorescein luciferase method using the bactiter glotm microbial cell viability assay kit magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 2 4 cfd simulation the 3d cfd models of spacer filled flow channels were built using ansys workbench 19 1 student version the numerical simulation was therewith performed to give insights into the impacts of feed spacer geometries on the hydraulics in the flow channel which would be highly correlated with the membrane fouling rate the governing equations of the cfd model are described in the supplementary material 2 4 1 computational domain and meshing due to the restriction of computational power and other reasons most of the previous relevant studies took a small area of representative spacer frames sometimes even a single mesh as the computational domain picioreanu et al 2009 in the current study in order to validate the periodicity of fully developed flow field along the flow direction a block with a size of 3 5 spacer frames in x y plane and the same height as the spacer in z direction was constructed the computational domain that is the liquid domain here was established by the boolean subtraction between the volumes of the block and the feed spacer in consideration of the delicate geometry of the feed spacer the computational domain should be meshed carefully to acquire enough grids to diminish the calculation error especially for areas such as the boundary layer regions and the filament intersections where the fluid velocity gradients change rapidly mesh refinement were needed to ensure the high calculation accuracy the number of grids of the calculating models was about 2 3 million independent verifications were performed to affirm that the grid numbers satisfied the computational requirement 2 4 2 boundary conditions the inlet flow velocity was specified at 0 12 m s the same as that of the fouling experiments while the pressure in the outlet plane was set to be 0 i e the atmospheric pressure given that the membrane permeate velocity was much lower than the cross flow velocity no slip wall conditions were applied on the channel walls and the spacer surfaces koutsou et al 2009 2 5 statistical analysis the correlation between normalized permeate flux and toc atp concentration as well as that between toc atp concentration and shear stress were obtained by pearson correlation analysis two tailed t test was employed to assess the significance of the independent and the dependent variables the statistical analysis was conducted with origin 9 1 3 results 3 1 cfd simulation fig 2 presents the flow velocity contours on the feed spacer plane perpendicular to the permeate direction in different spacer filled channels in the figure the bulk cross flow direction is from the bottom left to the upper right all the flow field profiles showed periodic distribution patterns along the flow direction when the inlet effect was ignored the stagnation zones were universally observed behind the filament junctions along the streamlines while the turbulence zones were mainly located near the thinning parts of the filaments although the nsl spacer exhibited a higher local velocity it also generated a larger area of stagnation zones in the vicinity of the filament junctions the results indicate that the feed spacer geometries had vital impact on the flow velocity field in the membrane channels the pressure drops across the channel were calculated and shown as fig s3 the results infer that the promotion of turbulence is at the cost of the increase of fcp drop nsl spacer filled channel exhibited higher local velocity 0 326 m s and average velocity 0 149 m s whilst it suffered the largest fcp drop the higher local flow velocity near the membrane is believed to be beneficial to reduce cp effect but it also leads to higher pumping energy consumption and eventually becomes marginal to alleviate membrane fouling 3 2 hydraulic performance 3 2 1 feed channel pressure drop the pumping energy consumption caused by the presence of feed spacers were determined by measuring the pressure drops across the flow cells table s1 the variation of fcp drop per unit of length with crossflow velocity is plotted in fig 3 and compared with the simulation results in fig s3 the experimental results and the simulation results are in good agreement with the deviation within 8 6 different spacer geometries differed substantially in the hydraulic resistance nsl caused the highest fcp drop followed by ndl0 ndl1 3 and ndl1 2 the geometry of alternating filament diameter created narrow gaps between the feed spacer and the membrane surface generating turbulence nearby and increasing the fcp drop the larger mesh size of nsl was supposed to be a favorable factor to lower fcp drop but nsl induced the highest fcp drop of 5 6 mbar cm indicating the design as single layer feed spacer of filaments had a more significant impact on the fcp drop 3 2 2 pure water flux pure water permeation flux is an important aspect for the evaluation of hydraulic performance of feed spacers according to darcy s law water flux is determined by transmembrane pressure tmp and membrane resistance during the filtration process the total resistance r could be deemed as constant when there is no fouling but the tmp values were different due to the fcp drops caused by different feed spacers dreszer et al 2014 1 j tmp μ r 2 tmp p inlet p inlet δ p ch 2 p permeate 3 r r membrane r fouling where μ is the dynamic viscosity of water r is the total resistance including the intrinsic membrane resistance and the fouling resistance and δp chis the feed channel pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet p inlet and p permeate are constant and r foulingis zero in the hydraulic tests pure water flux of spacer filled channels is linked up with the fcp drop induced by feed spacers δp ch and the applied pressure at inlet p inlet as shown in fig 3 feed spacers would cause a considerable fcp drop compared to the spacer free channel taking an swm module with the length of one meter for example the fcp drops would range from 0 46 to 0 56 bar depending on the specific feed spacer in this study and as such the tmp would range from 4 34 to 4 44 bar when the inlet crossflow velocity was 0 12 m s and the applied pressure of 4 9 bar fig 4 in practice the rate of fcp drop mbar cm will decrease along the swm channel as flow velocity slows indicating the differences in fcp drop tmp and thus pure water flux among different spacer filled channels would be somewhat smaller than that when the change of fcp drop rate was not accounted for however this effect was not considered in this study 3 3 membrane fouling toc and atp concentrations indicating organic and biological fouling respectively on the membrane spacer surface of different membrane channels are shown in fig 5 a and b besides the normalized permeate flux of different channels when the membrane and spacer are fouled is presented in fig 5 c and the correlation between normalized permeate flux and toc atp concentration is plotted in fig 5 d for the spacer filled channels foulants were more inclined to accumulate on the membrane surface with average toc and atp contents of 0 26 mg cm2 and 68 0 pg cm2 respectively than the spacer surface 0 13 mg toc cm2 and 34 8 pg atp cm2 implying membrane fouling was more severe than spacer fouling comparison of membrane fouling with and without feed spacer showed that feed spacers could substantially alleviate membrane fouling see pink bars in fig 5 a and yellow bars in fig 5 b the normalized permeate flux fig 5 c illustrates the anti fouling performances of different membrane channels which shows a highly significant negative correlation with membrane spacer fouling fig 5 d the ndl0 spacer filled channel outperformed the others in that it had the lowest toc and atp concentrations the ndl1 3 and ndl1 2 feed spacers showed similar anti fouling performances it indicates that for the dual layer feed spacers of non uniform filaments the feature that the thinning zones locating near the filament junctions improved the anti fouling performance most the nsl filled channel showed the lowest normalized permeate flux as the membrane and spacer fouling was much more severe than the other feed channels on the one hand the global turbulence of nsl spacer filled channel was weaker due to the larger mesh size which exerted limited effect on mitigating fouling on the membrane surface on the other hand the water blocking effect of single layer of filaments might provide secure habitat for the adhesion of biofilm on the membrane spacer although the positive effect of feed spacers on membrane fouling had been reported by other researchers suwarno et al 2014 our finding revealed that a poorly designed spacer geometry may have an adverse impact on the anti fouling performance 4 discussion 4 1 spacer geometry and hydraulic performance hydraulic performance is usually adopted for the evaluation of feed spacers in previous studies the ratio of sherwood number and power number had been widely applied which denotes the promotion of mass transport at the expense of pumping energy consumption li et al 2002b saeed et al 2015 shakaib et al 2009 fcp drop is an important cause of energy loss and our study demonstrates the presence of feed spacers could induce a considerable fcp drop 7 0 8 6 times compared to the spacer free channel and different spacer filled channels showed a difference in the fcp drop 4 6 5 6 mbar cm when inlet crossflow velocity was 0 12 m s previous studies claimed that the presence of feed spacers could increase more than 10 times pressure drop in a clean membrane channel compared to that without spacer which was as low as 0 3 mbar cm picioreanu et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 which shows good coherence with our study a recently published paper found that the fcp drop for a standard spacer was 6 4 mbar cm for an inlet crossflow velocity of 0 16 m s while a modified spacer geometry could reduce the value to 1 1 mbar cm at the same condition ali et al 2019 supporting our perspective that fcp drop could be significantly affected by spacer geometry in the hydraulic tests pure water permeation fluxes of different spacer filled channels were very similar as the pressure drop across the filtration cell with the length of 9 20 cm was negligible less than 1 of the operating pressure nevertheless when membrane fouling mainly discussed in section 4 2 was taken into consideration the spacer geometry would affect the rate of biofouling and in turn fcp drop and tmp and therefore the different spacer filled channels would show a substantial difference in the permeate flux fig 5 c previous studies also observed the fcp drop in a 9 day biofouling experiment would exceed 300 of that in the hydraulic tests and the difference in fcp drop among different feed spacers would become larger too siddiqui et al 2017a vrouwenvelder et al 2009 in practical applications more than one swm module are connected in series and biofouling is inevitable and as such the difference in fcp drop and permeate flux between various feed spacers will be magnified therefore the evaluation of hydraulic performance of feed spacer should be focused mainly on fcp drop and there is ample space for the improvement of spacer geometry to reduce fcp drop the characteristics of non uniform filament feed spacers had a crucial impact on the fcp drop to eliminate the influence of different mesh sizes an nsl like spacer with the same mesh size as ndl spacers was simulated and the results are shown in fig s4 the nsl like spacer exhibited a much higher fcp drop of 16 3 mbar cm at the crossflow velocity of 0 12 m s implying that the design of single layer feed spacer of a smaller mesh with non uniform filaments resulted in a higher resistance to the flow especially around the junctions although it could generate a higher local velocity in the thinning zones as can be seen in fig s4 for ndl spacers the difference in fcp drops was possibly ascribed to the width of thinning zones the thinning zones of ndl1 2 was wider than that of ndl0 and ndl1 3 which increased the water flowing area by 15 and led to a lower flow resistance actually for the feed spacers of non uniform filaments flow resistance was linked up more closely with the number of filaments single or dual layer the non uniformity of filament diameter and the width of thinning zones in terms of hydrodynamics thinning zones in the filaments allow the flow to pass through and hinder the formation of stagnant areas indicating the positioning of thinning zones may be oriented to prevent the deposition of foulants at specific spots 4 2 spacer geometry and membrane fouling anti fouling performance is another important aspect for the spacer design indeed the geometric characteristics of feed spacers influence membrane fouling by altering the flow field fig 6 illustrates the simulation results of average shear stress near the membrane surface and feed spacer filaments and their correlation with membrane spacer fouling the wall shear stress of feed spacer is higher than that of membrane surface explaining the result that spacer fouling was generally less severe than membrane fouling fig 5 statistical analysis reveals that the shear stress was significantly inversely correlated with toc atp concentration on the membrane spacer indicating the positive effect of high shear stress on retarding organic and biological fouling the growth of biofilm is governed by the feed flow which not only provides nutrients for microbials but also affects the attachment and detachment process by shear stress vrouwenvelder et al 2010 theoretically the increase of shear stress can enhance the lift force exerted on the particle foulant in the hydraulic boundary layer which strengthens mass transport and minimizes particle foulant deposition wang and li 2014 although some researchers suggested a higher shear force resulted in a more compacted biofilm that was more difficult to mitigate stoodley et al 2002 vrouwenvelder et al 2011 a majority of researchers commonly accept that enhancing the shear stress could hinder the initial attachment and facilitate the detachment of microorganisms leading to a less accumulation of biomass koutsou et al 2009 ngene et al 2010 picioreanu et al 2009 radu et al 2012 suwarno et al 2014 suwarno et al 2012 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 our results support the latter opinion suggesting that high shear stress should be taken into account for the design of feed spacer geometry fig 7 presents the deposited foulants on the membrane surface in different spacer filled channels from fig 7 it could be observed that the membrane fouling in nsl spacer filled channel was the most severe followed by ndl1 3 ndl1 2 and ndl0 which matches well with the quantitative measurement results in fig 5 the foulants had a propensity to deposit around the contact region between feed spacer and membrane surface especially at the filament junctions where the flow slowed down and the dead zones were formed the cfd simulation results revealed the large stagnant zones around the junctions of nsl filled channel which was probably responsible for the worst fouling at these zones the foulant deposition was not obvious around the filament junctions of ndl0 spacer filled channel probably because the thinning zones were near the filament junctions which allowed streams to pass through from the contact region disturbed the dead zones and partially washed away the deposited foulants in addition foulants were inclined to deposit in the low velocity regions such as the center region of the spacer mesh the results suggest that the characteristics of non uniform filaments of feed spacers will impose a significant effect on the extent and the spatial distribution of membrane fouling 4 3 implications this study could provide some important implications with regard to the design of feed spacers of non uniform filaments firstly the structure of dual layer of non uniform filaments is more suggested instead of single layer although the single layer filament spacer could generate narrower flow path and induce higher local flow velocity it also brought about higher fcp drop non uniform flow pattern larger area of dead zones and resultantly more severe membrane fouling secondly the non uniformity of spacer filaments should be carefully designed to achieve better hydraulic and anti fouling performances there are some factors to consider such as the range of alternating filament diameter the positioning and width of thinning zones and etc the design of thinning zones in the filaments aims to reduce cp effect and destruct dead zones and as such the thinning zones should be positioned near the spots where the foulants tend to deposit such as the junctions of filaments thirdly the trade off between hydraulic performance and anti fouling performance should be taken into consideration in general a higher fcp drop usually accompanies with a stronger turbulence which is beneficial to reduce membrane fouling 5 conclusions in this study four kinds of commercial feed spacers were used to explore the impacts of different characteristics of non uniform filament feed spacer on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances the hydraulic performance was evaluated based on feed channel pressure drop and membrane permeate flux using pure water as the feed and the anti fouling performance was assessed by conducting short term fouling experiments using synthetic feed solutions cfd simulations were performed to give insights into the influence of feed spacer geometries on the flow field thereout on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances the main conclusions of this paper are as follows 1 the configuration of feed spacers including the number of filament layers the non uniformity of filament diameter and the width and positioning of thinning zones affected the flow field leading to various hydraulic and anti fouling performances in the spacer filled channels the poorly designed feed spacers would increase energy loss but have limited benefit in alleviating membrane fouling 2 it is recommended to construct feed spacers into a structure of dual layer of filaments instead of single layer of alternating thin and thick filaments 3 the thinning zones located around the filament junctions was conducive to reduce membrane fouling the positioning of thinning zones in the spacer filaments should be carefully designed to reduce potential dead zones 4 developing feed spacers with better hydraulic and anti fouling performances is necessary declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17616,feed spacer is universally used in spiral wound nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membrane modules it can separate membrane sheets create flow channels promote turbulence and enhance mass transfer however it also induces increased pressure drop across the flow channel and generates dead zones for biofilm growth at specific locations optimization of feed spacer geometries is highly desirable for energy saving and biofouling control in this study four kinds of commercial feed spacers featured with non uniform filaments were compared in terms of hydraulic and anti fouling performances computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were launched to give insights into the impacts of feed spacer characteristics on the flow field results show that the hydraulic performance was substantially affected by the number of filament layers single or dual layer the non uniformity of filament diameter and the width of thinning zones the design of single layer feed spacer of non uniform filaments was not recommended due to high flow resistance and poor anti fouling performance the feed spacer structure of alternating filament diameter contributed to reducing dead zones and alleviating membrane fouling the thinning zones located adjacent to the filament junctions achieved better anti fouling performance as it disturbed the dead zones and partially washed away the deposited foulants this study demonstrates for the first time that the characteristics of non uniform filament feed spacer had a crucial impact on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances and suggests that more emphasis should be laid on number of filament layers variation of filament diameter and width and positioning of thinning zones for the optimization of feed spacer geometries in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords feed spacer non uniform filaments hydraulic performance anti fouling computational fluid dynamics cfd 1 introduction spiral wound membrane swm modules of nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been widely applied in seawater desalination water treatment and wastewater reclamation hijnen et al 2012 an swm module is mainly composed of membrane sheets feed and permeate spacers and a central permeate tube schwinge et al 2004 membrane sheets are glued and rolled around the central permeate tube with feed spacers sandwiched between membrane sheets li and tung 2008 saeed et al 2012 the advantages of spiral wound nf ro modules lie in steady running small footprint and high efficiency and automation lin et al 2019 wang et al 2019 however swm modules in practical applications could also suffer from severe membrane fouling which decreases water productivity increases operating pressure and shortens membrane lifespan kostoglou and karabelas 2012 depending on foulant compositions membrane fouling is generally divided into four categories namely particulate and colloidal deposition organic fouling scaling and biofouling flemming et al 1997 nagaraj et al 2018 among these types of fouling biofouling eventually leading to the formation of biofilm is regarded as the most troublesome one because it is extremely difficult to be controlled and eliminated by pre treatment bereschenko et al 2011 saeed et al 2000 feed spacer is an essential part of swm modules which separates membrane sheets and creates flow channels as the turbulence promotor it can intensify flow turbulence enhance mass transfer and reduce concentration polarization cp bucs et al 2015 gao et al 2013 however the presence of feed spacer results in increase of feed channel pressure fcp drop and energy consumption of the membrane system especially when biofouling occurs for which fcp drop would be substantially increased by up to nearly fourfold of that with no biofouling ali et al 2019 dreszer et al 2014 vrouwenvelder et al 2009 furthermore water flow dead zones tend to develop near the intersections of spacer filaments where flow velocity slows and microorganisms have a propensity to adhere and form the biofilm vrouwenvelder et al 2009 therefore the design of feed spacer is targeted at enhancing mass transfer and lowering pressure drop as well as achieving better anti fouling performance kerdi et al 2018 miller et al 2012 rice et al 2018 ronen et al 2013 wibisono et al 2015 yang et al 2009 numerical simulations have been performed

uniform cylindrical filaments but they differed in the varying rules of the filament diameter with the thinning zones of ndl0 ndl1 3 and ndl1 2 locating near the filament junctions 0 in the trisection

feed spacers were cut into coupons and soaked in ultrapure water for a minimum of 24 h and then placed into the cells and compacted under 5 0 bar the upper value of optimal operating pressure of df30 by filtering ultrapure water for 12 h after 12 h of compaction the pure water flux was stable and constant afterwards hydraulic tests were carried out with ultrapure water to evaluate the hydraulic performances of different spacer filled channels in which feed channel pressure fcp drop was measured using differential pressure transmitters ejx110a yokogawa electric corporation japan at various flow rates and permeate flux was determined using an electronic balance under varying applied pressure when the hydraulic tests were finished the feed tank was replenished with the synthetic feed solution for the fouling experiments short term biofouling studies with nutrient dosage can be well used to assess the anti biofouling performance of feed spacers siddiqui et al 2017a to facilitate the fouling rates in the short term fouling experiments the applied pressure was kept at the upper optimal operating pressure of 5 0 bar a strain of pseudomonas was firstly inoculated in the r2a

determination for the biomass quantification bucs et al 2014b as indicated in fig s2 six membrane pieces each with an area of 1 2 cm2 at locations close to the inlet the middle and the outlet of filtration cells were selected and cut for toc and atp measurements the organic fouling on the membrane spacer surface was characterized by toc measurement valladares linares et al 2014 firstly the pieces of membrane and feed spacer were cut off from the coupon secondly each of the fouled membrane and feed spacer was immersed in a 0 2 hcl solution ph 1 3 for 24 h separately after which 10 ml of 0 26 naoh solution was added into each of the previously used 0 2 hcl solutions equivalent to 0 1 naoh solution followed by a second 24 h soaking to enhance the effectiveness of foulants elution the soaking process was operated in a thermostatic shaker under 25 c and 150 rpm at last each eluate was filtered through 0 45 µm filters prior to toc determination toc level was calculated as total organic carbon per cm2 of membrane atp content was measured in order to estimate the accumulated biomass on the membrane spacer siddiqui et al 2017a each of the fouled membrane and spacer was cut up and put into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube thereafter the tubes were filled with 0 5 ml of sterilized physiological saline and vibrated using a vortex shaker for 3 min to extract the biomass into the solution the extraction process was repeated for three times the atp content in the extract was determined according to the fluorescein luciferase method using the bactiter glotm microbial cell viability assay kit magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 2 4 cfd simulation the 3d cfd models of spacer filled flow channels were built using ansys workbench 19 1 student version the numerical simulation was therewith performed to give insights into the impacts of feed spacer geometries on the hydraulics in the flow channel which would be highly correlated with the membrane fouling rate the governing equations of the cfd model are described in the supplementary material 2 4 1 computational domain and meshing due to the restriction of computational power and other reasons most of the previous relevant studies took a small area of representative spacer frames sometimes even a single mesh as the computational domain picioreanu et al 2009 in the current study in order to validate the periodicity of fully developed flow field along the flow direction a block with a size of 3 5 spacer frames in x y plane and the same height as the spacer in z direction was constructed the computational domain that is the liquid domain here was established by the boolean subtraction between the volumes of the block and the feed spacer in consideration of the delicate geometry of the feed spacer the computational domain should be meshed carefully to acquire enough grids to diminish the calculation error especially for areas such as the boundary layer regions and the filament intersections where the fluid velocity gradients change rapidly mesh refinement were needed to ensure the high calculation accuracy the number of grids of the calculating models was about 2 3 million independent verifications were performed to affirm that the grid numbers satisfied the computational requirement 2 4 2 boundary conditions the inlet flow velocity was specified at 0 12 m s the same as that of the fouling experiments while the pressure in the outlet plane was set to be 0 i e the atmospheric pressure given that the membrane permeate velocity was much lower than the cross flow velocity no slip wall conditions were applied on the channel walls and the spacer surfaces koutsou et al 2009 2 5 statistical analysis the correlation between normalized permeate flux and toc atp concentration as well as that between toc atp concentration and shear stress were obtained by pearson correlation analysis two tailed t test was employed to assess the significance of the independent and the dependent variables the statistical analysis was conducted with origin 9 1 3 results 3 1 cfd simulation fig 2 presents the flow velocity contours on the feed spacer plane perpendicular to the permeate direction in different spacer filled channels in the figure the bulk cross flow direction is from the bottom left to the upper right all the flow field profiles showed periodic distribution patterns along the flow direction when the inlet effect was ignored the stagnation zones were universally observed behind the filament junctions along the streamlines while the turbulence zones were mainly located near the thinning parts of the filaments although the nsl spacer exhibited a higher local velocity it also generated a larger area of stagnation zones in the vicinity of the filament junctions the results indicate that the feed spacer geometries had vital impact on the flow velocity field in the membrane channels the pressure drops across the channel were calculated and shown as fig s3 the results infer that the promotion of turbulence is at the cost of the increase of fcp drop nsl spacer filled channel exhibited higher local velocity 0 326 m s and average velocity 0 149 m s whilst it suffered the largest fcp drop the higher local flow velocity near the membrane is believed to be beneficial to reduce cp effect but it also leads to higher pumping energy consumption and eventually becomes marginal to alleviate membrane fouling 3 2 hydraulic performance 3 2 1 feed channel pressure drop the pumping energy consumption caused by the presence of feed spacers were determined by measuring the pressure drops across the flow cells table s1 the variation of fcp drop per unit of length with crossflow velocity is plotted in fig 3 and compared with the simulation results in fig s3 the experimental results and the simulation results are in good agreement with the deviation within 8 6 different spacer geometries differed substantially in the hydraulic resistance nsl caused the highest fcp drop followed by ndl0 ndl1 3 and ndl1 2 the geometry of alternating filament diameter created narrow gaps between the feed spacer and the membrane surface generating turbulence nearby and increasing the fcp drop the larger mesh size of nsl was supposed to be a favorable factor to lower fcp drop but nsl induced the highest fcp drop of 5 6 mbar cm indicating the design as single layer feed spacer of filaments had a more significant impact on the fcp drop 3 2 2 pure water flux pure water permeation flux is an important aspect for the evaluation of hydraulic performance of feed spacers according to darcy s law water flux is determined by transmembrane pressure tmp and membrane resistance during the filtration process the total resistance r could be deemed as constant when there is no fouling but the tmp values were different due to the fcp drops caused by different feed spacers dreszer et al 2014 1 j tmp μ r 2 tmp p inlet p inlet δ p ch 2 p permeate 3 r r membrane r fouling where μ is the dynamic viscosity of water r is the total resistance including the intrinsic membrane resistance and the fouling resistance and δp chis the feed channel pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet p inlet and p permeate are constant and r foulingis zero in the hydraulic tests pure water flux of spacer filled channels is linked up with the fcp drop induced by feed spacers δp ch and the applied pressure at inlet p inlet as shown in fig 3 feed spacers would cause a considerable fcp drop compared to the spacer free channel taking an swm module with the length of one meter for example the fcp drops would range from 0 46 to 0 56 bar depending on the specific feed spacer in this study and as such the tmp would range from 4 34 to 4 44 bar when the inlet crossflow velocity was 0 12 m s and the applied pressure of 4 9 bar fig 4 in practice the rate of fcp drop mbar cm will decrease along the swm channel as flow velocity slows indicating the differences in fcp drop tmp and thus pure water flux among different spacer filled channels would be somewhat smaller than that when the change of fcp drop rate was not accounted for however this effect was not considered in this study 3 3 membrane fouling toc and atp concentrations indicating organic and biological fouling respectively on the membrane spacer surface of different membrane channels are shown in fig 5 a and b besides the normalized permeate flux of different channels when the membrane and spacer are fouled is presented in fig 5 c and the correlation between normalized permeate flux and toc atp concentration is plotted in fig 5 d for the spacer filled channels foulants were more inclined to accumulate on the membrane surface with average toc and atp contents of 0 26 mg cm2 and 68 0 pg cm2 respectively than the spacer surface 0 13 mg toc cm2 and 34 8 pg atp cm2 implying membrane fouling was more severe than spacer fouling comparison of membrane fouling with and without feed spacer showed that feed spacers could substantially alleviate membrane fouling see pink bars in fig 5 a and yellow bars in fig 5 b the normalized permeate flux fig 5 c illustrates the anti fouling performances of different membrane channels which shows a highly significant negative correlation with membrane spacer fouling fig 5 d the ndl0 spacer filled channel outperformed the others in that it had the lowest toc and atp concentrations the ndl1 3 and ndl1 2 feed spacers showed similar anti fouling performances it indicates that for the dual layer feed spacers of non uniform filaments the feature that the thinning zones locating near the filament junctions improved the anti fouling performance most the nsl filled channel showed the lowest normalized permeate flux as the membrane and spacer fouling was much more severe than the other feed channels on the one hand the global turbulence of nsl spacer filled channel was weaker due to the larger mesh size which exerted limited effect on mitigating fouling on the membrane surface on the other hand the water blocking effect of single layer of filaments might provide secure habitat for the adhesion of biofilm on the membrane spacer although the positive effect of feed spacers on membrane fouling had been reported by other researchers suwarno et al 2014 our finding revealed that a poorly designed spacer geometry may have an adverse impact on the anti fouling performance 4 discussion 4 1 spacer geometry and hydraulic performance hydraulic performance is usually adopted for the evaluation of feed spacers in previous studies the ratio of sherwood number and power number had been widely applied which denotes the promotion of mass transport at the expense of pumping energy consumption li et al 2002b saeed et al 2015 shakaib et al 2009 fcp drop is an important cause of energy loss and our study demonstrates the presence of feed spacers could induce a considerable fcp drop 7 0 8 6 times compared to the spacer free channel and different spacer filled channels showed a difference in the fcp drop 4 6 5 6 mbar cm when inlet crossflow velocity was 0 12 m s previous studies claimed that the presence of feed spacers could increase more than 10 times pressure drop in a clean membrane channel compared to that without spacer which was as low as 0 3 mbar cm picioreanu et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 which shows good coherence with our study a recently published paper found that the fcp drop for a standard spacer was 6 4 mbar cm for an inlet crossflow velocity of 0 16 m s while a modified spacer geometry could reduce the value to 1 1 mbar cm at the same condition ali et al 2019 supporting our perspective that fcp drop could be significantly affected by spacer geometry in the hydraulic tests pure water permeation fluxes of different spacer filled channels were very similar as the pressure drop across the filtration cell with the length of 9 20 cm was negligible less than 1 of the operating pressure nevertheless when membrane fouling mainly discussed in section 4 2 was taken into consideration the spacer geometry would affect the rate of biofouling and in turn fcp drop and tmp and therefore the different spacer filled channels would show a substantial difference in the permeate flux fig 5 c previous studies also observed the fcp drop in a 9 day biofouling experiment would exceed 300 of that in the hydraulic tests and the difference in fcp drop among different feed spacers would become larger too siddiqui et al 2017a vrouwenvelder et al 2009 in practical applications more than one swm module are connected in series and biofouling is inevitable and as such the difference in fcp drop and permeate flux between various feed spacers will be magnified therefore the evaluation of hydraulic performance of feed spacer should be focused mainly on fcp drop and there is ample space for the improvement of spacer geometry to reduce fcp drop the characteristics of non uniform filament feed spacers had a crucial impact on the fcp drop to eliminate the influence of different mesh sizes an nsl like spacer with the same mesh size as ndl spacers was simulated and the results are shown in fig s4 the nsl like spacer exhibited a much higher fcp drop of 16 3 mbar cm at the crossflow velocity of 0 12 m s implying that the design of single layer feed spacer of a smaller mesh with non uniform filaments resulted in a higher resistance to the flow especially around the junctions although it could generate a higher local velocity in the thinning zones as can be seen in fig s4 for ndl spacers the difference in fcp drops was possibly ascribed to the width of thinning zones the thinning zones of ndl1 2 was wider than that of ndl0 and ndl1 3 which increased the water flowing area by 15 and led to a lower flow resistance actually for the feed spacers of non uniform filaments flow resistance was linked up more closely with the number of filaments single or dual layer the non uniformity of filament diameter and the width of thinning zones in terms of hydrodynamics thinning zones in the filaments allow the flow to pass through and hinder the formation of stagnant areas indicating the positioning of thinning zones may be oriented to prevent the deposition of foulants at specific spots 4 2 spacer geometry and membrane fouling anti fouling performance is another important aspect for the spacer design indeed the geometric characteristics of feed spacers influence membrane fouling by altering the flow field fig 6 illustrates the simulation results of average shear stress near the membrane surface and feed spacer filaments and their correlation with membrane spacer fouling the wall shear stress of feed spacer is higher than that of membrane surface explaining the result that spacer fouling was generally less severe than membrane fouling fig 5 statistical analysis reveals that the shear stress was significantly inversely correlated with toc atp concentration on the membrane spacer indicating the positive effect of high shear stress on retarding organic and biological fouling the growth of biofilm is governed by the feed flow which not only provides nutrients for microbials but also affects the attachment and detachment process by shear stress vrouwenvelder et al 2010 theoretically the increase of shear stress can enhance the lift force exerted on the particle foulant in the hydraulic boundary layer which strengthens mass transport and minimizes particle foulant deposition wang and li 2014 although some researchers suggested a higher shear force resulted in a more compacted biofilm that was more difficult to mitigate stoodley et al 2002 vrouwenvelder et al 2011 a majority of researchers commonly accept that enhancing the shear stress could hinder the initial attachment and facilitate the detachment of microorganisms leading to a less accumulation of biomass koutsou et al 2009 ngene et al 2010 picioreanu et al 2009 radu et al 2012 suwarno et al 2014 suwarno et al 2012 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 our results support the latter opinion suggesting that high shear stress should be taken into account for the design of feed spacer geometry fig 7 presents the deposited foulants on the membrane surface in different spacer filled channels from fig 7 it could be observed that the membrane fouling in nsl spacer filled channel was the most severe followed by ndl1 3 ndl1 2 and ndl0 which matches well with the quantitative measurement results in fig 5 the foulants had a propensity to deposit around the contact region between feed spacer and membrane surface especially at the filament junctions where the flow slowed down and the dead zones were formed the cfd simulation results revealed the large stagnant zones around the junctions of nsl filled channel which was probably responsible for the worst fouling at these zones the foulant deposition was not obvious around the filament junctions of ndl0 spacer filled channel probably because the thinning zones were near the filament junctions which allowed streams to pass through from the contact region disturbed the dead zones and partially washed away the deposited foulants in addition foulants were inclined to deposit in the low velocity regions such as the center region of the spacer mesh the results suggest that the characteristics of non uniform filaments of feed spacers will impose a significant effect on the extent and the spatial distribution of membrane fouling 4 3 implications this study could provide some important implications with regard to the design of feed spacers of non uniform filaments firstly the structure of dual layer of non uniform filaments is more suggested instead of single layer although the single layer filament spacer could generate narrower flow path and induce higher local flow velocity it also brought about higher fcp drop non uniform flow pattern larger area of dead zones and resultantly more severe membrane fouling secondly the non uniformity of spacer filaments should be carefully designed to achieve better hydraulic and anti fouling performances there are some factors to consider such as the range of alternating filament diameter the positioning and width of thinning zones and etc the design of thinning zones in the filaments aims to reduce cp effect and destruct dead zones and as such the thinning zones should be positioned near the spots where the foulants tend to deposit such as the junctions of filaments thirdly the trade off between hydraulic performance and anti fouling performance should be taken into consideration in general a higher fcp drop usually accompanies with a stronger turbulence which is beneficial to reduce membrane fouling 5 conclusions in this study four kinds of commercial feed spacers were used to explore the impacts of different characteristics of non uniform filament feed spacer on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances the hydraulic performance was evaluated based on feed channel pressure drop and membrane permeate flux using pure water as the feed and the anti fouling performance was assessed by conducting short term fouling experiments using synthetic feed solutions cfd simulations were performed to give insights into the influence of feed spacer geometries on the flow field thereout on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances the main conclusions of this paper are as follows 1 the configuration of feed spacers including the number of filament layers the non uniformity of filament diameter and the width and positioning of thinning zones affected the flow field leading to various hydraulic and anti fouling performances in the spacer filled channels the poorly designed feed spacers would increase energy loss but have limited benefit in alleviating membrane fouling 2 it is recommended to construct feed spacers into a structure of dual layer of filaments instead of single layer of alternating thin and thick filaments 3 the thinning zones located around the filament junctions was conducive to reduce membrane fouling the positioning of thinning zones in the spacer filaments should be carefully designed to reduce potential dead zones 4 developing feed spacers with better hydraulic and anti fouling performances is necessary declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17617,the carbonate radical co3 is a typical secondary radical observed in engineering and natural aquatic systems this study investigated the degradation kinetics of 20 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps by co3 and the transformation pathways of a typical ppcp naproxen that is susceptible to co3 co3 is highly selective for compounds containing aniline and phenolic hydroxyl groups as well as naphthalene rings such as sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine salbutamol propranolol naproxen and macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin for which the second order rate constants range from 5 6 107 m 1s 1 to 2 96 108 m 1s 1 a good linear relationship is observed between the natural logarithms of k co3 and the negative values of the hammett σσp constant for aromatic ppcps indicating that electron donating groups promote the attack of benzene derivatives by co3 the contribution of co3 to naproxen degradation is significant in different processes such as uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv chlorine and uv monochloramine in the presence of hco3 which compensates for the decreased contributions of primary radicals in particular the formation of co3 increases the first order rate constant of naproxen by 127 in uv monochloramine in the presence of 50 mm hco3 compared to that without hco3 natural organic matter nom exerts a slight scavenging effect on co3 decreasing the inhibition effect of nom on the degradation of naproxen by uv h2o2 in the presence of hco3 the pathways involved in the transformation of naproxen by co3 include decarboxylation hydroxylation ketonization demethylation and aldolization in addition the alteration of the genotoxicity during naproxen degradation by co3 was negligible graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation process aop carbonate radical co3 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps water treatment 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are causes for increasing concern due to their frequent occurrence in aquatic environments at the ng l 1 to µg l 1 level duca and boldescu 2009 ppcps are known to be released into aquatic environments through multiple pathways including domestic wastewater hospital discharges improper manufacturer disposal and wastewater treatment plants leung et al 2012 liu and wong 2013 however most ppcps are not effectively removed by conventional water and wastewater treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation filtration and biological processes and may be present in drinking water at a low concentration range of ng µg l 1 heberer 2002 luo et al 2014 advanced oxidation processes aops effectively remove ppcps by generating reactive radicals such as the hydroxyl radical ho e 0 ho h2o 1 9 2 7 v sulfate radical so4 e 0 so4 so4 2 2 5 3 1 v and chlorine radical cl e 0 cl cl 2 47 v buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1977 xiang et al 2016 due to the inevitable presence of hco3 and co3 2 in aquatic systems the primary ho cl and so4 radicals are partially transformed to a secondary carbonate radical co3 through the processes described in eqs 1 3 buxton and elliot 1986 huie and clifton 1990 mertens and sonntag 1995 1 hco3 co3 2 ho co3 h2o oh k

1 106 m 1s 1 the concentrations of co3 were reported to be 4 and 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of ho and so4 respectively in the uv h2o2 and uv persulfate uv ps aops in the presence of hco3 co3 2 zhang et al 2015 meanwhile in surface water solar indirect photolysis systems containing nitrate nitrite and or natural organic matter nom produce co3 through the reactions of ho or excited triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3nom and hco3 co3 2 for which the steady state concentrations were reported to be 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of ho canonica et al 2005 huang and mabury 2000 lam et al 2003 sulzberger et al 1997 wu and linden 2010 therefore co3 is widely present in engineering and natural water systems however the specific roles of co3 in different processes are unclear and a comparison is needed co3 is a selective oxidant e 0 1 78 v at ph 7 which redox potential is lower than those of ho and so4 neta et al 1988 the second order rate constants k of co3 reacting with organic compounds range from 102 109 m 1s 1 behar et al 1970 cope et al 1973 moore et al 1977 co3 was reported to react rapidly with compounds containing electron rich groups such as nitrogen and sulfur containing substrates and aromatic compounds neta et al 1988 for example co3 was reported to react with phenol and aniline with k of 2 2 107 m 1s 1 and 5 0 108 m 1s 1 respectively larson and zepp 1988 moore et al 1977 co3 possesses high reaction rate constants for different micropollutants such as clenbuterol 5 2 108 m 1s 1 ketoprofen 3 9 108 m 1s 1 paracetamol 1 7 108 m 1s 1 and oxytetracycline 2 9 108 m 1s 1 liu et al 2016 wols et al 2015 therefore the roles of co3 in the degradation of structurally diverse ppcps differ and the relationship between reactivity and structure should be clarified regarding the reaction mechanism of co3 co3 was reported to react with organic matter through electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction liu et al 2018 2016 moore et al 1977 co3 reacts with phenol and bisphenol a via electron transfer to generate a phenolic radical cation which then further transforms to a phenoxyl radical gao et al 2020 moore et al 1977 similarly for tertiary amines electron transfer from the n atom to co3 yields an amine radical cation followed by proton elimination dell arciprete et al 2012 elango et al 1984 while hydrogen abstraction yields n centred radicals for primary amines liu et al 2018 in the present study co3 was highly reactive towards compounds containing aniline and phenolic hydroxyl groups as well as a naphthalene ring however previous studies focused on the degradation pathways of phenols and amine derivatives but the pathways underlying the transformation of the naphthalene ring by co3 remain unknown therefore the purposes of this study are 1 to investigate the kinetics and structural relationships of a number of structurally diverse ppcps degraded by co3 2 to elucidate the transformation pathways and alterations in the toxicity of a typical ppcp containing a naphthalene ring after a reaction with co3 and 3 to compare the roles of co3 in different aops such as uv h2o2 uv ps uv chlorine uv cl2 and uv monochloramine uv nh2cl twenty structurally diverse ppcps table s1 were selected for purpose 1 and naproxen npx was selected as the target compound for purposes 2 and 3 npx was selected because it is widely used and frequently occurs in aquatic systems madikizela and chimuka 2016 and it reacts with co3 but the transformation mechanism is unknown additionally npx exhibits adverse effects on aquatic organisms with an ec50 of 21 2 μg l 1 to vibrio fischeri balakrishna et al 2017 and it may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke even at trace levels manrique moreno et al 2010 2

photochemical experiment was initiated by exposing a 700 ml solution containing 5 μm npx and 50 mm hco3 to uv irradiation and simultaneously dosing with 50 μm oxidant i e h2o2 ps cl2 or nh2cl samples were collected at different time intervals and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate at a molar ratio of sodium thiosulfate to oxidant of 4 1 control tests of the degradation of npx by uv photolysis and oxidant alone were also performed the tests of 20 ppcps were conducted in a similar manner but solutions were spiked with 1 μg l of each ppcp the ph was buffered at 8 6 by hco3 or phosphate buffer in all the tests note that the concentrations of hco3 range from 38 to 575 mg l in wwtp effluents and from 61 to 183 mg l in surface waters lai et al 2017 higher concentration of hco3 50 mm was used in this study to create a system only containing co3 and to clarify the reaction mechanism of co3 with npx all tests were performed at least twice and the error bars in all the plots represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data of the results of the duplicate tests in addition npx nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba were used as probe compounds to determine the steady

increased to 50 μm 200 μm and 100 mm respectively to identify the degradation products and genotoxicity of npx after the reaction with co3 note that ho was completely quenched and converted to co3 under this condition fig s3 the genotoxicity of npx 50 μm after uv cl2 200 μm treatment was also investigated to compare with that after co3 treatment after a certain reaction period a 500 ml sample

of k for the reaction of co3 with ppcps were determined by competition kinetics experiments using npx as a reference compound which reacts with co3 at 5 6 107 m 1s 1 wols et al 2015 the uv h2o2 aop was conducted at a h2o2 dosage of 50 μm in the presence of 50 mm hco3 to create an effective condition for co3 production note that 99 7 ho was converted to co3 under this condition fig s4 and the contributions of 0 3 ho to ppcp degradation were less than 7 7 table s2 the degradation kinetics of ppcps by co3 all followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s5 then the values of k for the ppcps

was not effective at degrading most ppcps except for sulfamethoxazole k 0 00113 s 1 all ppcps were degraded quickly by the uv h2o2 aop with k in the range of 0 00225 0 00527 s 1 which was mainly attributed to ho in uv h2o2 hco3 the degradation of some ppcps was significantly inhibited however the degradation of other ppcps was inhibited less significantly or even increased the specific k of ho k ho was almost completely inhibited 99 7 in uv h2o2 hco3 fig s4 and the values of co3 k co3 ranged from 0 0 00618 s 1 to facilitate the discussion the 20 ppcps were divided into two groups according to the contributions of co3 to the degradation of ppcps 1 ppcps for which co3 had a negligible contribution to their degradation were defined as group i k co3 0 00022 s 1 including dimetridazole metronidazole ornidazole tinidazole ronidazole bezafibrate caffeine atrazine nalidixic acid carbamazepine atenolol venlafaxine and mecoprop 2 ppcps that showed strong reactivity with co3 were designated as group ii k co3 0 00084 0 00618 s 1 including trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole propranolol azithromycin sulfamethazine salbutamol and npx specifically the k of trimethoprim propranolol azithromycin and npx decreased by 77 3 21 3 46 8 and 69 8 respectively while the values of sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine and salbutamol increased by 13 44 5 and 44 7 respectively in the presence of 50 mm hco3 the k values of co3 for these 20 ppcps were determined using competition kinetics experiments fig s6 and the k values were consistent with those available in literatures table s4 in addition we obtained the k of co3 reacting with the following ppcps from wols et al 2015 and yan et al 2019 for a more comprehensive comparison of the value of k of co3 reacting with organic compounds paracetamol clenbuterol sotalol diclofenac erythromycin a gemfibrozil clofibric acid and vanillic acid p coumaric acid these organic compounds are divided into seven categories according to their functions or functional groups fig 2 a substituted phenols salbutamol 1 51 108 m 1s 1 paracetamol 1 70 108 m 1s 1 vanillic acid 5 0 108 m 1s 1 and p coumaric acid 4 60 108 m 1s 1 naphthalene ring derivatives propranolol 1 92 108 m 1s 1 and npx 5 60 107 m 1s 1 aniline derivatives sulfamethoxazole 2 48 108 m 1s 1 sulfamethazine 2 96 108 m 1s 1 clenbuterol 5 20 108 m 1s 1 sotalol 2 20 108 m 1s 1 and diclofenac 7 80 107 m 1s 1 amines excluding aniline trimethoprim 4 91 107 m 1s 1 carbamazepine 1 25 107 m 1s 1 and atenolol 9 79 106 m 1s 1 n heterocyclic carbenes nitroimidazoles 5 09 9 11 106 m 1s 1 atrazine 9 39 106 m 1s 1 nalidixic acid 7 49 106 m 1s 1 and caffeine 6 09 106 m 1s 1 macrolide antibiotics azithromycin 9 12 107 m 1s 1 and erythromycin a 8 0 107 m 1s 1 and lipid regulators bezafibrate 5 33 106 m 1s 1 gemfibrozil 4 10 106 m 1s 1 and clofibric acid 1 0 107 m 1s 1 amongst these seven groups substituted phenols naphthalene ring derivatives aniline derivatives and macrolide antibiotics react faster with co3 5 0 107 m 1s 1 while other groups react slowly 5 0 107 m 1s 1 thus the aniline phenolic hydroxyl group and naphthalene ring are more likely to react with co3 and the reaction rates of common amines are slower than anilines for example the k of co3 reacting with trimethoprim was lower than those of the aniline derivatives even though it contains two amino groups a primary qsar was established based on the assumption that the benzene ring was the main site of attack to better explain the reactivity of ho and co3 towards aromatic ppcps several ppcps in each group were selected for the qsar atenolol venlafaxine bezafibrate and mecoprop in group i and trimethoprim and salbutamol in group ii in addition to the ppcps listed above six ppcps with known k co3 were also selected to increase the sample size clenbuterol diclofenac paracetamol clofibric acid gemfibrozil and sotalol wols et al 2015 these ppcps were selected due to their available hammett σ constants the qsars between k co3 and k ho of the aromatic ppcps and hammett σ constants were established table s4 and excel s1 the natural logarithms of k co3 lnk co3 of the 12 ppcps increased linearly with increasing hammett σ constants as shown in eq 5 fig 2b here σ represents the hammett σ constants of the substituents on the aromatic compounds 5 ln k c o 3 3 91 σ 13 4 r 2 0 8959 the reactivity of ho was maintained at a constant value as the hammett σ constants decreased likely due to the closeness of the values to the diffusion controlled limit while the reactivity of co3 increased significantly indicating that co3 is more selective towards electron rich compounds than ho the reactivity of co3 with aromatic ppcps depends on the electron donating properties of substituents on the aromatic ring 3 2 roles of co3 in different uv based aops npx was selected as the target compound to elucidate the roles of co3 in different aops uv h2o2 uv cl2 uv nh2cl and uv ps aops in the presence of 50 mm hco3 the overall k of npx degradation by the uv h2o2 uv ps and uv cl2 aops changed slightly while the k by uv nh2cl increased significantly by 127 compared to that without hco3 fig 3 the specific k of co3 is expected to significantly contribute to the overall k which would compensate for the decrease in the contributions of primary radicals to npx degradation notably the values of k for npx degradation by uv and uv hco3 were identical in the absence of hco3 k is attributable to ho in uv h2o2 and ho and so4 in uv ps xie et al 2015 in uv cl2 and uv nh2cl ho and reactive chlorine species rcs are involved in particular clo is present in the former reaction system while reactive nitrogen species rns are involved in the latter system wu et al 2019 fang et al 2014 in the presence of hco3 co3 is produced in the reactions between hco3 and ho so4 cl cl2 but clo was reported to be not reactive toward hco3 by analogy to co3 2 which reacts with clo at a low k of 600 m 1s 1 wu et al 2017 nist 2020 the k for the reaction between co3 and npx 5 60 107 m 1s 1 is 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than the k values for the reactions including ho 8 61 109 m 1s 1 cl 2 01 1010 m 1s 1 and so4 5 64 109 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 lian et al 2017 wols et al 2015 however the concentrations of co3 in these aops may be much higher as the lifetime of co3 is longer than that of ho due to the much lower radical radical recombination rate of co3 k 2 107 m 1s 1 than ho k 5 5 109 m 1s 1 chen et al 2019 lai et al 2017 by using a kinetic model the concentrations of co3 reached 2 2 10 11 9 5 10 10 and 5 2 10 9 m in the uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv nh2cl aops in presence of 50 mm hco3 respectively table s5 and that in uv ps was also determined to be 6 8 10 11 m by experiment figs s7 and s8 interestingly the highest concentration of co3 was observed in uv nh2cl which coincided with the significant increase in k in uv nh2cl cl was the primary radical produced from the photolysis of nh2cl the scavenging rate constants of cl were calculated based on the k values of cl reacting with h2o oh hco3 npx and oxidants such as nh2cl and hocl ocl and their concentrations fig s9 cl reacts with h2o and oh at the scavenging rate constants of 2 5 105 and 7 2 104 s 1 respectively fig s9 guo et al 2018 to produce cloh at ph 8 6 then cloh was transformed to ho through a reversible reaction eq 6 grebel et al 2010 with the conversion yield of 67 1 as calculated using the kinetic model 6 cloh ho cl k 6 1 109 s 1 k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 however greater than 95 9 of cl would be converted to co3 by 50 mm hco3 which scavenging rate constant is 1 1 107 s 1 and is 2 orders of magnitude higher than h2o oh thus most of cl was converted to co3 through the direct reaction of hco3 in the presence of hco3 and the conversion rate was higher than that of the conversion of cl to ho in the absence of hco3 the direct formation of co3 from cl inhibited the decrease of the oxidation capacity of cl to npx abatement when cl was converted to ho with the low conversion yield of 67 1 resulting in the higher oxidation capacity for npx abatement in uv nh2cl with hco3 although cl is also present in uv cl2 the trend is different from uv nh2cl k by uv cl2 slightly changed in the presence of hco3 cl was primarily consumed by hocl ocl at a scavenging rate constant of 3 95 105 s 1 at ph 8 6 to directly form clo a value that is higher than the scavenging rate constant by h2o oh fig s9 clo was the predominant radical produced during npx degradation in uv cl2 with k toward npx of 2 30 109 m 1s 1 guo et al 2018 in the presence of 50 mm hco3 cl in uv cl2 was still largely converted to clo resulting in the slightly decreased clo concentration from 3 1 10 10 m to 2 5 10 10 m table s5 meanwhile co3 can also be formed through the reactions of hco3 with ho and cl2 with k values of 8 5 106 m 1s 1 and 8 0 106 m 1s 1 respectively matthew and anastasio 2006 nist 2020 the concentration of cl in uv nh2cl was 1 9 times higher than that in uv cl2 while those of ho and cl2 were one order of magnitude higher table s5 thus the concentration of co3 in uv nh2cl hco3 was one order of magnitude higher than that in uv cl2 hco3 3 3 effect of water matrices hco3 concentrations exerted a slight effect on the degradation of npx by the uv h2o2 aop fig 4 a the k only decreased by 2 11 6 in the presence of 5 100 mm hco3 compared to uv h2o2 in the absence of hco3 specifically as the hco3 concentration increased from 0 to 100 mm k ho significantly decreased from 0 00133 s 1 to 0 at 30 mm figs 4a and s10 while k co3 increased from 0 to 0 00130 s 1 the modelled concentration of ho significantly decreased from 1 0 10 13 m to 4 3 10 15 m as the hco3 concentration increased from 0 to 100 mm in the uv h2o2 aop whereas the concentration of co3 increased from 9 1 10 12 m to 2 3 10 11 m the concentration of co3 observed in the presence of hco3 was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of ho in the absence of hco3 obtained from the kinetic model table s5 meanwhile k for the reaction between co3 and npx 5 6 107 m 1s 1 is also 2 orders of magnitude lower than for the reaction between ho and npx 8 61 109 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 wols et al 2015 therefore the formation of co3 almost completely compensates for the decreased contribution of ho to npx degradation resulting in a slight change in the overall k in the presence of hco3 fig 4b shows the effect of nom on the degradation of npx by the uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 aops nom slowed npx degradation in both aops while the decrease in k in uv h2o2 was greater than that in uv h2o2 hco3 specifically 1 mg l nom decreased the values of k by 18 and 10 9 in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 respectively the molar absorption coefficient ɛ254 nm of nom is 3 15 m 1 mg l 1 fang et al 2014 which serves as an inner filter for uv light uv light transmittance was reduced by 10 6 in the reactor containing 1 mg l nom in the uv h2o2 system which reduced the h2o2 photolysis and thus decreased the production of ho and the subsequent formation of co3 therefore the decrease in the overall k in uv h2o2 hco3 was mainly due to the inner filter of nom furthermore nom significantly scavenged ho with a k of 2 0 104 mg 1 l s 1 while the consumption of co3 was negligible with a k of 135 mg 1 l s 1 yan et al 2019 therefore the scavenging effect of nom on co3 is negligible resulting in smaller effect of nom on the degradation of npx by uv h2o2 hco3 fig 4c shows the efficiencies of npx degradation by the uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 aops in tap water in tap water the k of npx degradation in uv h2o2 hco3 was similar to the value in uv h2o2 which were 0 00132 s 1 and 0 00127 s 1 respectively however both values of k for npx degradation decreased by 18 9 and 13 by uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 respectively compared to pure water the characteristics of the tap water are presented in table s6 the concentrations of nom cl and no3 were 1 36 mg l 11 65 mg l and 8 91 mg l respectively as mentioned above nom acts as an inner filter and a radical scavenger to consume ho which should be responsible for the decrease in k observed in tap water in addition the effects of no3 and cl are negligible the photolysis of no3 can produce ho but the production of ho by 5 mm no3 was negligible keen et al 2012 cl reacts quickly with ho but it is a reversible reaction jayson et al 1973 according to the kinetic model the steady state concentrations of ho and co3 in the presence of 11 65 mg l cl were similar to the concentrations observed in the absence of cl table s5 therefore the slight inhibition of npx degradation in tap water was mainly attributable to nom 3 4 pathways of npx degradation by co3 based on the products identified using uplc q tof ms the detailed information i e elemental formula and structure for the products obtained during the degradation of npx by co3 is provided in table s7 esi negative mode was used to identify the products generated during the degradation of npx the total ion chromatogram of npx is shown in fig s11 and the ms spectra of the npx main products are shown in fig s12 isomers of the degradation products are distinguished by the peaks at different retention time with the same mass to charge ratio m z during the degradation of npx by uv h2o2 hco3 the major products generated were p186 c12h10o2 m z 185 p202 c13h14o2 m z 201 p204 c11h8o4 m z 203 p216 c12h8o4 m z 215 p218a c12h10o4 m z 217 p218b c13h14o3 m z 217 p234a c12h10o5 m z 233 p234b c13h14o4 m z 233 p246a b c13h10o5 m z 245 p248a b c d c13h12o5 m z 247 p250a b c13h14o5 m z 249 p252 c12h12o6 m z 251 and p266 c13h14o6 m z 265 quantum chemical calculations were used to predict the reaction sites for co3 in npx which might be beneficial to refine the structure of products the homos were calculated for npx fig s13 the homos of npx were dominated by the c atoms on the naphthalene ring suggesting that the sites of npx attacked by the radicals are primarily located on aromatic rings moreover o17 and c22 on the side chains also contributed to the homos additionally the partial charges assigned to each atom for the npx molecules are shown in table s8 based on the homos and partial charges npx c10 npx c5 npx c2 and npx c11 located on the naphthalene ring provided the main contributions to the homos p202 is an initial intermediate in the process and thus p202 was calculated using the same method fig s13 and table s8 consistent with the result calculated for npx based on the quantum chemical calculations the reaction sites for co3 in npx were proposed fig 5 shows the time dependant evolutionary profiles of the major products of npx degraded by uv h2o2 hco3 at ph 8 6 the abundances of p202 p204 p216 p218a p218b p234b p246b p248a b c d and p266 initially increased and then decreased whereas the abundances of p186 p234a p246a p250a b and p252 monotonically increased with the reaction time based on the identified products the pathways of npx degradation by co3 are proposed in scheme 1 the main pathways of npx transformation by co3 included decarboxylation hydroxylation ketonization demethylation and aldolization first npx was transformed to p202 through decarboxylation and hydroxylation together or to p248c d through hydroxylation and demethylation then p202 was further transformed to p218b p234b p250a b and p266 via hydroxylation while the demethylation ketonization of p202 formed p186 the demethylation ketonization of p234b generated p216 and the demethylation aldolization of p234b generated p218a which was finally converted to p204 by demethylation furthermore p266 was transformed to p252 via demethylation p250a b was ketonized to form p248a b which then generated p234a and p246a b via demethylation and ketonization respectively compared with ho dulova et al 2017 pan et al 2018 the initial stages of npx transformation by co3 were similar namely demethylation hydroxylation and decarboxylation however the products formed by ho and co3 through these pathways are largely different and only p248c was observed at both the ho and co3 systems table s9 furthermore co3 transformation of npx subsequently resulted in the formation of a series of quinones aldehydes and ketones including p246a b p248a b p234a p186 p216 p218a and p204 the potential explanation for the differences is the difference in reaction mechanisms between co3 and ho the mechanisms of co3 are electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction liu et al 2018 2016 moore et al 1977 while the mechanisms of ho with npx are addition as the major step and hydrogen abstraction and single electron transfer as the minor steps luo et al 2018 similar to npx the degradation of bisphenol a by co3 was also mainly mediated by electron transfer to form hydroxylated products gao et al 2020 whereas the attack of ho on bisphenol a is mediated by addition and hydrogen abstraction sharma et al 2016 the different reaction mechanisms of co3 and ho were responsible for the differences in products generated during the degradation of npx by uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 although the kinetics were similar 3 5 alterations in the genotoxicity of npx after the co3 treatment the genotoxicity results are presented as the growth factor g and the induction ratio ir text s4 the ir value is valid when g 0 5 and the genotoxicity is considered positive when ir 2 a sample is considered weakly genotoxic if the ir is between 2 and 3 moderately genotoxic if between 3 and 6 and strongly genotoxic if 6 karci et al 2014 lv et al 2014 fig 6 shows the genotoxicity alteration during the npx degradation by co3 and uv cl2 note that the g values of all samples were greater than 0 5 fig s14 the initial ir value of npx is 1 47 1 56 indicating that npx does not have mutagenicity fig 6 the ir values were 0 96 1 47 indicating that the products formed during npx degradation by co3 have negligible mutagenic activities generally the toxicity of organic compounds positively correlates with their octanol water partition coefficients kow yang et al 2017 the negligible genotoxicity observed during npx degradation by co3 is partially attributed to the high hydrophilicity of the hydroxylated products additionally the genotoxicity of these naphthoquinone derivatives was also likely to be negligible as naphthoquinone derivatives are often used to treat tumours and many of their derivatives have proven to be effective as antimalarial and anti acquired immunodeficiency syndrome treatments li et al 2018 similar to that by co3 the genotoxicity was also negligible during the npx transformation by ho li et al 2020 however the ir value increased significantly and reached the maximum of 4 1 at the 50 removal rate of npx by uv cl2 which then decreased but still higher than 2 when the removal rate of npx was 95 fig 6 this indicates that the products formed during the npx degradation by uv cl2 have high mutagenicity mainly due to the formation of toxic chlorine containing products pan et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 sieira et al 2020 4 conclusions and engineering implications co3 selectively reacts with the compounds containing aniline and phenolic hydroxyl groups as well as naphthalene rings with the second order rate constants in the range of 5 6 107 m 1s 1 to 2 96 108 m 1s 1 by using a primary qsar the reactivity of co3 with ppcps was found to depend on the electron donating properties of substituents on the aromatic ring the presence of hco3 has slight effects on the degradation of npx by uv h2o2 uv ps and uv cl2 due to the formation of co3 and even significantly increased the k by 127 in uv nh2cl as the radical conversion from cl to co3 outcompeted the consumption of cl by side reactions the overall k of npx by uv h2o2 changed slightly as the hco3 concentrations increased from 5 to 100 mm due to that the formation of co3 almost completely compensated for the decreased contribution of ho to npx degradation the scavenging effect of nom on co3 is slight the reaction of co3 with npx is mediated by electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction while the reaction with ho is mainly mediated by addition importantly the degradation of npx by co3 does not increase genotoxicity however due to the complexity of the composition of the real water environment more precursor substances are needed for comprehensive assessment co3 2 hco3 is ubiquitous in natural water systems leading to the inevitable production of co3 by aops during water treatment the roles of co3 in the abatement of micropollutants depend on the compound additionally the effects of co3 on the degradation of ppcps varied in different aops under similar conditions the transformation of micropollutants susceptible to co3 differed from that

17617,the carbonate radical co3 is a typical secondary radical observed in engineering and natural aquatic systems this study investigated the degradation kinetics of 20 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps by co3 and the transformation pathways of a typical ppcp naproxen that is susceptible to co3 co3 is highly selective for compounds containing aniline and phenolic hydroxyl groups as well as naphthalene rings such as sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine salbutamol propranolol naproxen and macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin for which the second order rate constants range from 5 6 107 m 1s 1 to 2 96 108 m 1s 1 a good linear relationship is observed between the natural logarithms of k co3 and the negative values of the hammett σσp constant for aromatic ppcps indicating that electron donating groups promote the attack of benzene derivatives by co3 the contribution of co3 to naproxen degradation is significant in different processes such as uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv chlorine and uv monochloramine in the presence of hco3 which compensates for the decreased contributions of primary radicals in particular the formation of co3 increases the first order rate constant of naproxen by 127 in uv monochloramine in the presence of 50 mm hco3 compared to that without hco3 natural organic matter nom exerts a slight scavenging effect on co3 decreasing the inhibition effect of nom on the degradation of naproxen by uv h2o2 in the presence of hco3 the pathways involved in the transformation of naproxen by co3 include decarboxylation hydroxylation ketonization demethylation and aldolization in addition the alteration of the genotoxicity during naproxen degradation by co3 was negligible graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation process aop carbonate radical co3 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps water treatment 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are causes for increasing concern due to their frequent occurrence in aquatic environments at the ng l 1 to µg l 1 level duca and boldescu 2009 ppcps are known to be released into aquatic environments through multiple pathways including domestic wastewater hospital discharges improper manufacturer disposal and wastewater treatment plants leung et al 2012 liu and wong 2013 however most ppcps are not effectively removed by conventional water and wastewater treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation filtration and biological processes and may be present in drinking water at a low concentration range of ng µg l 1 heberer 2002 luo et al 2014 advanced oxidation processes aops effectively remove ppcps by generating reactive radicals such as the hydroxyl radical ho e 0 ho h2o 1 9 2 7 v sulfate radical so4 e 0 so4 so4 2 2 5 3 1 v and chlorine radical cl e 0 cl cl 2 47 v buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1977 xiang et al 2016 due to the inevitable presence of hco3 and co3 2 in aquatic systems the primary ho cl and so4 radicals are partially transformed to a secondary carbonate radical co3 through the processes described in eqs 1 3 buxton and elliot 1986 huie and clifton 1990 mertens and sonntag 1995 1 hco3 co3 2 ho co3 h2o oh k hco3 ho 8 5 106 m 1s 1 k co3 2 ho 3 9 108 m 1s 1 2 hco3 co3 2 cl co3 hcl cl k hco3 cl 2 2 108 m 1s 1 k co3 2 cl 5 0 108 m 1s 1 3 hco3 co3 2 so4 co3 h2so4 so4 2 k hco3 so4 9 1 106 m 1s 1 k co3 2 so4 4 1 106 m 1s 1 the concentrations of co3 were reported to be 4 and 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of ho and so4 respectively in the uv h2o2 and uv persulfate uv ps aops in the presence of hco3 co3 2 zhang et al 2015 meanwhile in surface water solar indirect photolysis systems containing nitrate nitrite and or natural organic matter nom produce co3 through the reactions of ho or excited triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3nom and hco3 co3 2 for which the steady state concentrations were reported to be 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of ho canonica et al 2005 huang and mabury 2000 lam et al 2003 sulzberger et al 1997 wu and linden 2010 therefore co3 is widely present in engineering and natural water systems however the specific roles of co3 in different processes are unclear and a comparison is needed co3 is a selective oxidant e 0 1 78 v at ph 7 which redox potential is lower than those of ho and so4 neta et al 1988 the second order rate constants k of co3 reacting with organic compounds range from 102 109 m 1s 1 behar et al 1970 cope et al 1973 moore et al 1977 co3 was reported to react rapidly with compounds containing electron rich groups such as nitrogen and sulfur containing substrates and aromatic compounds neta et al 1988 for example co3 was reported to react with phenol and aniline with k of 2 2 107 m 1s 1 and 5 0 108 m 1s 1 respectively larson and zepp 1988 moore et al 1977 co3 possesses high reaction rate constants for different micropollutants such as clenbuterol 5 2 108 m 1s 1 ketoprofen 3 9 108 m 1s 1 paracetamol 1 7 108 m 1s 1 and oxytetracycline 2 9 108 m 1s 1 liu et al 2016 wols et al 2015 therefore the roles of co3 in the degradation of structurally diverse ppcps differ and the relationship between reactivity and structure should be clarified regarding the reaction mechanism of co3 co3 was reported to react with organic matter through electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction liu et al 2018 2016 moore et al 1977 co3 reacts with phenol and bisphenol a via electron transfer to generate a phenolic radical cation which then further transforms to a phenoxyl radical gao et al 2020 moore et al 1977 similarly for tertiary amines electron transfer from the n atom to co3 yields an amine radical cation followed by proton elimination dell arciprete et al 2012 elango et al 1984 while hydrogen abstraction yields n centred radicals for primary amines liu et al 2018 in the present study co3 was highly reactive towards compounds containing aniline and phenolic hydroxyl groups as well as a naphthalene ring however previous studies focused on the degradation pathways of phenols and amine derivatives but the pathways underlying the transformation of the naphthalene ring by co3 remain unknown therefore the purposes of this study are 1 to investigate the kinetics and structural relationships of a number of structurally diverse ppcps degraded by co3 2 to elucidate the transformation pathways and alterations in the toxicity of a typical ppcp containing a naphthalene ring after a reaction with co3 and 3 to compare the roles of co3 in different aops such as uv h2o2 uv ps uv chlorine uv cl2 and uv monochloramine uv nh2cl twenty structurally diverse ppcps table s1 were selected for purpose 1 and naproxen npx was selected as the target compound for purposes 2 and 3 npx was selected because it is widely used and frequently occurs in aquatic systems madikizela and chimuka 2016 and it reacts with co3 but the transformation mechanism is unknown additionally npx exhibits adverse effects on aquatic organisms with an ec50 of 21 2 μg l 1 to vibrio fischeri balakrishna et al 2017 and it may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke even at trace levels manrique moreno et al 2010 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals and milli q water 18 2 mω cm sources of reagents are provided in text s1 of the supplementary materials the nh2cl stock solution was freshly prepared by slowly adding a sodium hypochlorite naocl solution to an ammonium chloride nh4cl solution at a mass ratio of cl n of 4 1 with rapid mixing for 40 min hand and margerum 1983 the ph of the nh4cl solution and naocl solution was adjusted to approximately 10 with a sodium hydroxide naoh solution before mixing the engineered bacterium salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 which served for the umu test was obtained from professor xin yu xiamen university china 2 2 experimental procedure all experiments were performed in a uv reactor as reported in wu et al 2019 text s1 the reactor was operated in batch mode with rapid mixing provided in the bottom of the reactor which stirring rate was set at 200 r min the schematic diagram of the uv cylindrical reactor is shown in fig s1 the uv photon flux i0 entering the solution was determined to be 0 331 μe s 1 using iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton and linden 2003 and the optical path length at 254 nm was 3 28 cm as determined by measuring the photolysis kinetics of dilute h2o2 fig s2 garoma and gurol 2005 the corresponding average uv fluence rate ep0 was about 0 75 mw cm 2 the basic photochemical experiment was initiated by exposing a 700 ml solution containing 5 μm npx and 50 mm hco3 to uv irradiation and simultaneously dosing with 50 μm oxidant i e h2o2 ps cl2 or nh2cl samples were collected at different time intervals and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate at a molar ratio of sodium thiosulfate to oxidant of 4 1 control tests of the degradation of npx by uv photolysis and oxidant alone were also performed the tests of 20 ppcps were conducted in a similar manner but solutions were spiked with 1 μg l of each ppcp the ph was buffered at 8 6 by hco3 or phosphate buffer in all the tests note that the concentrations of hco3 range from 38 to 575 mg l in wwtp effluents and from 61 to 183 mg l in surface waters lai et al 2017 higher concentration of hco3 50 mm was used in this study to create a system only containing co3 and to clarify the reaction mechanism of co3 with npx all tests were performed at least twice and the error bars in all the plots represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data of the results of the duplicate tests in addition npx nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba were used as probe compounds to determine the steady state concentrations of co3 ho and so4 respectively as described in the studies by fang et al 2014 and yang et al 2014 details shown in text s2 the initial concentrations of npx h2o2 and hco3 were increased to 50 μm 200 μm and 100 mm respectively to identify the degradation products and genotoxicity of npx after the reaction with co3 note that ho was completely quenched and converted to co3 under this condition fig s3 the genotoxicity of npx 50 μm after uv cl2 200 μm treatment was also investigated to compare with that after co3 treatment after a certain reaction period a 500 ml sample was collected and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate which was then concentrated to 2 ml through solid phase extraction spe using an hlb cartridge 200 mg 6 ml waters using a procedure described in the literature michael et al 2012 2 3 analytical methods the ph was determined using a ph metre fe20 mettler toledo the concentrations of naocl and nh2cl were determined using dpd fas titration apha awwa wef 2012 the concentrations of npx nb and ba were analysed using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1260 usa equipped with a c18 column poroshell 4 6 50 mm 2 7 μm and a diode array detector dad pan et al 2018 ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms with an electrospray ionization source esi was used to identify the degradation products of npx details shown in text s3 twenty ppcps were quantified on an hplc agilent 1290 connected with an online spe system spark agilent and coupled with a triple quadrupole mass system with an electrospray ionization source ab sciex 5500 using the method reported in the study by guo et al 2018 the genotoxicity of the products of npx generated by co3 was analysed using the sos umu test according to iso13829 2000 and lv et al 2014 the umu test evaluates the genotoxic activity of chemical compounds using the expression of the sos repair mechanism associated with the umuc gene the detail method of the determination of genotoxicity is provided in text s4 2 4 determination of the second order rate constants of co3 reacting with ppcps the values of k for the reaction of co3 with ppcps were determined by competition kinetics experiments using npx as a reference compound which reacts with co3 at 5 6 107 m 1s 1 wols et al 2015 the uv h2o2 aop was conducted at a h2o2 dosage of 50 μm in the presence of 50 mm hco3 to create an effective condition for co3 production note that 99 7 ho was converted to co3 under this condition fig s4 and the contributions of 0 3 ho to ppcp degradation were less than 7 7 table s2 the degradation kinetics of ppcps by co3 all followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s5 then the values of k for the ppcps reacting with co3 were calculated using eq 4 4 ln ppcp 0 ppcp k c o 3 p p c p k c o 3 n p x ln npx 0 npx where k co3 ppcp and k co3 npx represent the k of co3 reacting with the selected ppcps and npx respectively 2 5 qsar analysis a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar was employed to explore the relationship between the structures of aromatic ppcps and their reactivity towards different radicals hammett σ constants were calculated to represent the electron donating large negative value or electron withdrawing large positive value properties of substituents on aromatic compounds details shown in text s5 hansch et al 1991 1995 lee and von gunten 2012 and the k ln k of co3 reacting with ppcps represented the reactivity 2 6 quantum chemistry calculation all calculations for structural optimizations and molecular orbital distributions were performed based on density functional theory at the b3lyp 6 31 g 2df p level and the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model iefpcm using the gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2010 structural optimization was conducted without any symmetry constraints and the minima were verified by a vibrational analysis the molecular orbital distribution contained the highest occupied molecular orbitals homos 2 7 kinetic modelling the concentrations of different reactive species in uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv nh2cl aops were simulated through kinetic modelling using kintecus software v5 50 which can calculate the concentrations of different species based on all the reactions involved in a specific process and the corresponding reaction rate constants kintecus 2020 details of the reactions are shown in table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of 20 ppcps by co3 fig 1 compares the pseudo first order rate constants k of 20 ppcps degraded by uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 in pure water at ph 8 6 the degradation of all the ppcps was negligible in h2o2 alone data not shown while direct uv photolysis was not effective at degrading most ppcps except for sulfamethoxazole k 0 00113 s 1 all ppcps were degraded quickly by the uv h2o2 aop with k in the range of 0 00225 0 00527 s 1 which was mainly attributed to ho in uv h2o2 hco3 the degradation of some ppcps was significantly inhibited however the degradation of other ppcps was inhibited less significantly or even increased the specific k of ho k ho was almost completely inhibited 99 7 in uv h2o2 hco3 fig s4 and the values of co3 k co3 ranged from 0 0 00618 s 1 to facilitate the discussion the 20 ppcps were divided into two groups according to the contributions of co3 to the degradation of ppcps 1 ppcps for which co3 had a negligible contribution to their degradation were defined as group i k co3 0 00022 s 1 including dimetridazole metronidazole ornidazole tinidazole ronidazole bezafibrate caffeine atrazine nalidixic acid carbamazepine atenolol venlafaxine and mecoprop 2 ppcps that showed strong reactivity with co3 were designated as group ii k co3 0 00084 0 00618 s 1 including trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole propranolol azithromycin sulfamethazine salbutamol and npx specifically the k of trimethoprim propranolol azithromycin and npx decreased by 77 3 21 3 46 8 and 69 8 respectively while the values of sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine and salbutamol increased by 13 44 5 and 44 7 respectively in the presence of 50 mm hco3 the k values of co3 for these 20 ppcps were determined using competition kinetics experiments fig s6 and the k values were consistent with those available in literatures table s4 in addition we obtained the k of co3 reacting with the following ppcps from wols et al 2015 and yan et al 2019 for a more comprehensive comparison of the value of k of co3 reacting with organic compounds paracetamol clenbuterol sotalol diclofenac erythromycin a gemfibrozil clofibric acid and vanillic acid p coumaric acid these organic compounds are divided into seven categories according to their functions or functional groups fig 2 a substituted phenols salbutamol 1 51 108 m 1s 1 paracetamol 1 70 108 m 1s 1 vanillic acid 5 0 108 m 1s 1 and p coumaric acid 4 60 108 m 1s 1 naphthalene ring derivatives propranolol 1 92 108 m 1s 1 and npx 5 60 107 m 1s 1 aniline derivatives sulfamethoxazole 2 48 108 m 1s 1 sulfamethazine 2 96 108 m 1s 1 clenbuterol 5 20 108 m 1s 1 sotalol 2 20 108 m 1s 1 and diclofenac 7 80 107 m 1s 1 amines excluding aniline trimethoprim 4 91 107 m 1s 1 carbamazepine 1 25 107 m 1s 1 and atenolol 9 79 106 m 1s 1 n heterocyclic carbenes nitroimidazoles 5 09 9 11 106 m 1s 1 atrazine 9 39 106 m 1s 1 nalidixic acid 7 49 106 m 1s 1 and caffeine 6 09 106 m 1s 1 macrolide antibiotics azithromycin 9 12 107 m 1s 1 and erythromycin a 8 0 107 m 1s 1 and lipid regulators bezafibrate 5 33 106 m 1s 1 gemfibrozil 4 10 106 m 1s 1 and clofibric acid 1 0 107 m 1s 1 amongst these seven groups substituted phenols naphthalene ring derivatives aniline derivatives and macrolide antibiotics react faster with co3 5 0 107 m 1s 1 while other groups react slowly 5 0 107 m 1s 1 thus the aniline phenolic hydroxyl group and naphthalene ring are more likely to react with co3 and the reaction rates of common amines are slower than anilines for example the k of co3 reacting with trimethoprim was lower than those of the aniline derivatives even though it contains two amino groups a primary qsar was established based on the assumption that the benzene ring was the main site of attack to better explain the reactivity of ho and co3 towards aromatic ppcps several ppcps in each group were selected for the qsar atenolol venlafaxine bezafibrate and mecoprop in group i and trimethoprim and salbutamol in group ii in addition to the ppcps listed above six ppcps with known k co3 were also selected to increase the sample size clenbuterol diclofenac paracetamol clofibric acid gemfibrozil and sotalol wols et al 2015 these ppcps were selected due to their available hammett σ constants the qsars between k co3 and k ho of the aromatic ppcps and hammett σ constants were established table s4 and excel s1 the natural logarithms of k co3 lnk co3 of the 12 ppcps increased linearly with increasing hammett σ constants as shown in eq 5 fig 2b here σ represents the hammett σ constants of the substituents on the aromatic compounds 5 ln k c o 3 3 91 σ 13 4 r 2 0 8959 the reactivity of ho was maintained at a constant value as the hammett σ constants decreased likely due to the closeness of the values to the diffusion controlled limit while the reactivity of co3 increased significantly indicating that co3 is more selective towards electron rich compounds than ho the reactivity of co3 with aromatic ppcps depends on the electron donating properties of substituents on the aromatic ring 3 2 roles of co3 in different uv based aops npx was selected as the target compound to elucidate the roles of co3 in different aops uv h2o2 uv cl2 uv nh2cl and uv ps aops in the presence of 50 mm hco3 the overall k of npx degradation by the uv h2o2 uv ps and uv cl2 aops changed slightly while the k by uv nh2cl increased significantly by 127 compared to that without hco3 fig 3 the specific k of co3 is expected to significantly contribute to the overall k which would compensate for the decrease in the contributions of primary radicals to npx degradation notably the values of k for npx degradation by uv and uv hco3 were identical in the absence of hco3 k is attributable to ho in uv h2o2 and ho and so4 in uv ps xie et al 2015 in uv cl2 and uv nh2cl ho and reactive chlorine species rcs are involved in particular clo is present in the former reaction system while reactive nitrogen species rns are involved in the latter system wu et al 2019 fang et al 2014 in the presence of hco3 co3 is produced in the reactions between hco3 and ho so4 cl cl2 but clo was reported to be not reactive toward hco3 by analogy to co3 2 which reacts with clo at a low k of 600 m 1s 1 wu et al 2017 nist 2020 the k for the reaction between co3 and npx 5 60 107 m 1s 1 is 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than the k values for the reactions including ho 8 61 109 m 1s 1 cl 2 01 1010 m 1s 1 and so4 5 64 109 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 lian et al 2017 wols et al 2015 however the concentrations of co3 in these aops may be much higher as the lifetime of co3 is longer than that of ho due to the much lower radical radical recombination rate of co3 k 2 107 m 1s 1 than ho k 5 5 109 m 1s 1 chen et al 2019 lai et al 2017 by using a kinetic model the concentrations of co3 reached 2 2 10 11 9 5 10 10 and 5 2 10 9 m in the uv h2o2 uv cl2 and uv nh2cl aops in presence of 50 mm hco3 respectively table s5 and that in uv ps was also determined to be 6 8 10 11 m by experiment figs s7 and s8 interestingly the highest concentration of co3 was observed in uv nh2cl which coincided with the significant increase in k in uv nh2cl cl was the primary radical produced from the photolysis of nh2cl the scavenging rate constants of cl were calculated based on the k values of cl reacting with h2o oh hco3 npx and oxidants such as nh2cl and hocl ocl and their concentrations fig s9 cl reacts with h2o and oh at the scavenging rate constants of 2 5 105 and 7 2 104 s 1 respectively fig s9 guo et al 2018 to produce cloh at ph 8 6 then cloh was transformed to ho through a reversible reaction eq 6 grebel et al 2010 with the conversion yield of 67 1 as calculated using the kinetic model 6 cloh ho cl k 6 1 109 s 1 k 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 however greater than 95 9 of cl would be converted to co3 by 50 mm hco3 which scavenging rate constant is 1 1 107 s 1 and is 2 orders of magnitude higher than h2o oh thus most of cl was converted to co3 through the direct reaction of hco3 in the presence of hco3 and the conversion rate was higher than that of the conversion of cl to ho in the absence of hco3 the direct formation of co3 from cl inhibited the decrease of the oxidation capacity of cl to npx abatement when cl was converted to ho with the low conversion yield of 67 1 resulting in the higher oxidation capacity for npx abatement in uv nh2cl with hco3 although cl is also present in uv cl2 the trend is different from uv nh2cl k by uv cl2 slightly changed in the presence of hco3 cl was primarily consumed by hocl ocl at a scavenging rate constant of 3 95 105 s 1 at ph 8 6 to directly form clo a value that is higher than the scavenging rate constant by h2o oh fig s9 clo was the predominant radical produced during npx degradation in uv cl2 with k toward npx of 2 30 109 m 1s 1 guo et al 2018 in the presence of 50 mm hco3 cl in uv cl2 was still largely converted to clo resulting in the slightly decreased clo concentration from 3 1 10 10 m to 2 5 10 10 m table s5 meanwhile co3 can also be formed through the reactions of hco3 with ho and cl2 with k values of 8 5 106 m 1s 1 and 8 0 106 m 1s 1 respectively matthew and anastasio 2006 nist 2020 the concentration of cl in uv nh2cl was 1 9 times higher than that in uv cl2 while those of ho and cl2 were one order of magnitude higher table s5 thus the concentration of co3 in uv nh2cl hco3 was one order of magnitude higher than that in uv cl2 hco3 3 3 effect of water matrices hco3 concentrations exerted a slight effect on the degradation of npx by the uv h2o2 aop fig 4 a the k only decreased by 2 11 6 in the presence of 5 100 mm hco3 compared to uv h2o2 in the absence of hco3 specifically as the hco3 concentration increased from 0 to 100 mm k ho significantly decreased from 0 00133 s 1 to 0 at 30 mm figs 4a and s10 while k co3 increased from 0 to 0 00130 s 1 the modelled concentration of ho significantly decreased from 1 0 10 13 m to 4 3 10 15 m as the hco3 concentration increased from 0 to 100 mm in the uv h2o2 aop whereas the concentration of co3 increased from 9 1 10 12 m to 2 3 10 11 m the concentration of co3 observed in the presence of hco3 was 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of ho in the absence of hco3 obtained from the kinetic model table s5 meanwhile k for the reaction between co3 and npx 5 6 107 m 1s 1 is also 2 orders of magnitude lower than for the reaction between ho and npx 8 61 109 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 wols et al 2015 therefore the formation of co3 almost completely compensates for the decreased contribution of ho to npx degradation resulting in a slight change in the overall k in the presence of hco3 fig 4b shows the effect of nom on the degradation of npx by the uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 aops nom slowed npx degradation in both aops while the decrease in k in uv h2o2 was greater than that in uv h2o2 hco3 specifically 1 mg l nom decreased the values of k by 18 and 10 9 in uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 respectively the molar absorption coefficient ɛ254 nm of nom is 3 15 m 1 mg l 1 fang et al 2014 which serves as an inner filter for uv light uv light transmittance was reduced by 10 6 in the reactor containing 1 mg l nom in the uv h2o2 system which reduced the h2o2 photolysis and thus decreased the production of ho and the subsequent formation of co3 therefore the decrease in the overall k in uv h2o2 hco3 was mainly due to the inner filter of nom furthermore nom significantly scavenged ho with a k of 2 0 104 mg 1 l s 1 while the consumption of co3 was negligible with a k of 135 mg 1 l s 1 yan et al 2019 therefore the scavenging effect of nom on co3 is negligible resulting in smaller effect of nom on the degradation of npx by uv h2o2 hco3 fig 4c shows the efficiencies of npx degradation by the uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 aops in tap water in tap water the k of npx degradation in uv h2o2 hco3 was similar to the value in uv h2o2 which were 0 00132 s 1 and 0 00127 s 1 respectively however both values of k for npx degradation decreased by 18 9 and 13 by uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 respectively compared to pure water the characteristics of the tap water are presented in table s6 the concentrations of nom cl and no3 were 1 36 mg l 11 65 mg l and 8 91 mg l respectively as mentioned above nom acts as an inner filter and a radical scavenger to consume ho which should be responsible for the decrease in k observed in tap water in addition the effects of no3 and cl are negligible the photolysis of no3 can produce ho but the production of ho by 5 mm no3 was negligible keen et al 2012 cl reacts quickly with ho but it is a reversible reaction jayson et al 1973 according to the kinetic model the steady state concentrations of ho and co3 in the presence of 11 65 mg l cl were similar to the concentrations observed in the absence of cl table s5 therefore the slight inhibition of npx degradation in tap water was mainly attributable to nom 3 4 pathways of npx degradation by co3 based on the products identified using uplc q tof ms the detailed information i e elemental formula and structure for the products obtained during the degradation of npx by co3 is provided in table s7 esi negative mode was used to identify the products generated during the degradation of npx the total ion chromatogram of npx is shown in fig s11 and the ms spectra of the npx main products are shown in fig s12 isomers of the degradation products are distinguished by the peaks at different retention time with the same mass to charge ratio m z during the degradation of npx by uv h2o2 hco3 the major products generated were p186 c12h10o2 m z 185 p202 c13h14o2 m z 201 p204 c11h8o4 m z 203 p216 c12h8o4 m z 215 p218a c12h10o4 m z 217 p218b c13h14o3 m z 217 p234a c12h10o5 m z 233 p234b c13h14o4 m z 233 p246a b c13h10o5 m z 245 p248a b c d c13h12o5 m z 247 p250a b c13h14o5 m z 249 p252 c12h12o6 m z 251 and p266 c13h14o6 m z 265 quantum chemical calculations were used to predict the reaction sites for co3 in npx which might be beneficial to refine the structure of products the homos were calculated for npx fig s13 the homos of npx were dominated by the c atoms on the naphthalene ring suggesting that the sites of npx attacked by the radicals are primarily located on aromatic rings moreover o17 and c22 on the side chains also contributed to the homos additionally the partial charges assigned to each atom for the npx molecules are shown in table s8 based on the homos and partial charges npx c10 npx c5 npx c2 and npx c11 located on the naphthalene ring provided the main contributions to the homos p202 is an initial intermediate in the process and thus p202 was calculated using the same method fig s13 and table s8 consistent with the result calculated for npx based on the quantum chemical calculations the reaction sites for co3 in npx were proposed fig 5 shows the time dependant evolutionary profiles of the major products of npx degraded by uv h2o2 hco3 at ph 8 6 the abundances of p202 p204 p216 p218a p218b p234b p246b p248a b c d and p266 initially increased and then decreased whereas the abundances of p186 p234a p246a p250a b and p252 monotonically increased with the reaction time based on the identified products the pathways of npx degradation by co3 are proposed in scheme 1 the main pathways of npx transformation by co3 included decarboxylation hydroxylation ketonization demethylation and aldolization first npx was transformed to p202 through decarboxylation and hydroxylation together or to p248c d through hydroxylation and demethylation then p202 was further transformed to p218b p234b p250a b and p266 via hydroxylation while the demethylation ketonization of p202 formed p186 the demethylation ketonization of p234b generated p216 and the demethylation aldolization of p234b generated p218a which was finally converted to p204 by demethylation furthermore p266 was transformed to p252 via demethylation p250a b was ketonized to form p248a b which then generated p234a and p246a b via demethylation and ketonization respectively compared with ho dulova et al 2017 pan et al 2018 the initial stages of npx transformation by co3 were similar namely demethylation hydroxylation and decarboxylation however the products formed by ho and co3 through these pathways are largely different and only p248c was observed at both the ho and co3 systems table s9 furthermore co3 transformation of npx subsequently resulted in the formation of a series of quinones aldehydes and ketones including p246a b p248a b p234a p186 p216 p218a and p204 the potential explanation for the differences is the difference in reaction mechanisms between co3 and ho the mechanisms of co3 are electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction liu et al 2018 2016 moore et al 1977 while the mechanisms of ho with npx are addition as the major step and hydrogen abstraction and single electron transfer as the minor steps luo et al 2018 similar to npx the degradation of bisphenol a by co3 was also mainly mediated by electron transfer to form hydroxylated products gao et al 2020 whereas the attack of ho on bisphenol a is mediated by addition and hydrogen abstraction sharma et al 2016 the different reaction mechanisms of co3 and ho were responsible for the differences in products generated during the degradation of npx by uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 although the kinetics were similar 3 5 alterations in the genotoxicity of npx after the co3 treatment the genotoxicity results are presented as the growth factor g and the induction ratio ir text s4 the ir value is valid when g 0 5 and the genotoxicity is considered positive when ir 2 a sample is considered weakly genotoxic if the ir is between 2 and 3 moderately genotoxic if between 3 and 6 and strongly genotoxic if 6 karci et al 2014 lv et al 2014 fig 6 shows the genotoxicity alteration during the npx degradation by co3 and uv cl2 note that the g values of all samples were greater than 0 5 fig s14 the initial ir value of npx is 1 47 1 56 indicating that npx does not have mutagenicity fig 6 the ir values were 0 96 1 47 indicating that the products formed during npx degradation by co3 have negligible mutagenic activities generally the toxicity of organic compounds positively correlates with their octanol water partition coefficients kow yang et al 2017 the negligible genotoxicity observed during npx degradation by co3 is partially attributed to the high hydrophilicity of the hydroxylated products additionally the genotoxicity of these naphthoquinone derivatives was also likely to be negligible as naphthoquinone derivatives are often used to treat tumours and many of their derivatives have proven to be effective as antimalarial and anti acquired immunodeficiency syndrome treatments li et al 2018 similar to that by co3 the genotoxicity was also negligible during the npx transformation by ho li et al 2020 however the ir value increased significantly and reached the maximum of 4 1 at the 50 removal rate of npx by uv cl2 which then decreased but still higher than 2 when the removal rate of npx was 95 fig 6 this indicates that the products formed during the npx degradation by uv cl2 have high mutagenicity mainly due to the formation of toxic chlorine containing products pan et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 sieira et al 2020 4 conclusions and engineering implications co3 selectively reacts with the compounds containing aniline and phenolic hydroxyl groups as well as naphthalene rings with the second order rate constants in the range of 5 6 107 m 1s 1 to 2 96 108 m 1s 1 by using a primary qsar the reactivity of co3 with ppcps was found to depend on the electron donating properties of substituents on the aromatic ring the presence of hco3 has slight effects on the degradation of npx by uv h2o2 uv ps and uv cl2 due to the formation of co3 and even significantly increased the k by 127 in uv nh2cl as the radical conversion from cl to co3 outcompeted the consumption of cl by side reactions the overall k of npx by uv h2o2 changed slightly as the hco3 concentrations increased from 5 to 100 mm due to that the formation of co3 almost completely compensated for the decreased contribution of ho to npx degradation the scavenging effect of nom on co3 is slight the reaction of co3 with npx is mediated by electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction while the reaction with ho is mainly mediated by addition importantly the degradation of npx by co3 does not increase genotoxicity however due to the complexity of the composition of the real water environment more precursor substances are needed for comprehensive assessment co3 2 hco3 is ubiquitous in natural water systems leading to the inevitable production of co3 by aops during water treatment the roles of co3 in the abatement of micropollutants depend on the compound additionally the effects of co3 on the degradation of ppcps varied in different aops under similar conditions the transformation of micropollutants susceptible to co3 differed from that

17618,the european union has proposed the value of 1 ng l 1 as a drinking water quality standard for estradiol with conventional technologies only partially removing estradiol the investigation of novel alternatives is more than ever required tagliavini and schäfer proposed that the use of a thin activated carbon layer combined with a membrane is worth considering in this work the process was further advanced through a systematic investigation of the role of activated carbon size activation and surface chemistry on the removal of estradiol the use of smaller carbon particles allows reaching the ambitious target value of 1 ng l 1 in a millimetric layer further adsorption kinetic enhancement by increasing the oxygen content on the carbon improves the removal from 96 to 99 for a layer of 2 mm for oh containing pollutants such as estradiol high removal together with low pressure and no by product formation are characteristics that make the uf pbsac a promising and competitive

introduction 1 1 steroid micropollutants an overview of occurrence legislation and removal strategies endocrine disrupting compounds edc especially hormones are emerging and persistent micropollutants mp in the environment luo et al 2014 eco toxicological studies have reported predicted no effect concentration pnec for estradiol e2 ranging from 1 to 5 ng l 1 anderson et al 2012 caldwell et al 2012 laurenson et al 2014 for other endocrine disrupters pnec is generally higher apart from the synthetic hormone ethinyl estradiol ee2 whose reported pnec ranges from 0 035 to 0 35 ng l 1 caldwell et al 2008 laurenson et al 2014 in 2011 the european commission proposed environmental quality standards eqs for e2 and ee2 of 0 4 and 0 035 ng l 1 respectively europeancommision 2011 further a drinking water quality standards of 1 ng l 1 was proposed for e2 europeancommision 2018 as advised by the world health organization who in its potable reuse document the who recommends a multiple barrier treatment consisting of membrane filtration micro and ultrafiltration mf uf and reverse osmosis ro uv disinfection and advanced oxidation processes aop who 2017 an example of this approach can be found in the newater treatment plant in singapore the combination of mf uf ro and uv disinfection allows reducing the concentration of e2 below 1 ng l 1 seah et al 2008 the high energy consumption of ro demands the development of more permeable processes such as nanofiltration nf radjenovic et al 2008 schäfer et al 2003 however not all nf membranes can achieve complete removal of neutral mp because of mp sorption to the polymer membrane and subsequent diffusion nghiem et al 2004 novel nf membranes are under investigation to overcome this limitation guo et al 2017 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b advanced oxidation processes such as ozonation are effectively removing mp while producing by products adsorption is considered the most suitable option for drinking water because it avoids the formation of such by products margot et al 2013 1 2 activated carbon adsorption activated carbon adsorption is a well known technology for removing mp from water sontheimer et al 1988 worch 2012 activated carbon ac is classified based on the size in granular gac 0 4 5 mm powdered pac 40 μm and super powdered spac 1 μm 100 nm activated carbon besides carbon based nanoparticle cnp 20 μm 1 nm ihsanullah 2019 tabish et al 2018 is receiving increasing attention as an effective adsorbent for mp nguyen et al 2020 the size of the ac is strongly related to the application technique gac is typically arranged in a fixed bed in what is referred to as gac filter altmann et al 2016 meinel et al 2014 paredes et al 2018 rostvall et al 2018 zietzschmann et al 2016 on the other side it is not practibable to use pac in a fixed bed the particle size is too small to allow good water permeation and the possible leakage of the ac alongside the treated water is an issue typically pac is continuously dosed as a slurry and removed via coagulation flocculation application of pac in a continuous process can also be achieved in the pac uf hybrid process where the uf is used to separate the particles from the treated water stoquart et al 2012 some examples of smaller carbon adsorbents compared to gac used as a fixed bed has been reported in literature as shown in table 1 for instance ruhl et al ruhl et al 2014 successfully integrated pac in a pumice deep filter recalling the so called haberer process published in 1991 haberer and normann schmidt 1991 the process was applied to the removal of several pharmaceuticals and other mp showing that removal was enhanced with immobilized pac compared to batch additional examples demonstrate the integration of pac spac and cnp in a polymeric membrane other reserchers amaral et al 2016 ellerie et al 2013 have coated a porous membrane uf or mf with pac spac and cnp for the removal of methylene blue and atrazine wu et al wu et al 2017 introduced the concept of a dynamic pac membrane where the pac is deposited as a fouling layer on the feed side of the mf however the purpose of this process was fouling control rather than mp removal finally several other examples can be found in which carbon nanoparticles are loaded within the membrane matrix before the casting process e g crock et al 2013 tagliavini and schäfer have proposed a novel approach to combine ac and membranes polymer based spherical activated carbon pbsac which had previously shown fast adsorption kinetics towards mp tagliavini et al 2017 is used as a thin millimetric layer placed on the permeate side of a uf membrane uf pbsac this permeate side approach presents some advantages compared to previously reported processes combining membrane and ac pbsac with a diameter of 450 μm was used in the form of a filter mat commercially used for protective clothes and filtration of odors böhringer et al 2011 adsorption of mp was demonstrated to be effective even in the thin layer mp removals were in the range of 60 to 80 at an empty bed contact time ebct of only 1 min tagliavini and schäfer 2018 the limitation in the maximum adsorption capacity deriving from the thin layer was not important due to the typically low mp concentration used further the process was shown to remove mp and natural organic matter simultaneously wolters et al 2019 1 3 material characteristics of activated carbon size pore morphology and surface chemistry the adsorption of mp onto ac depends on the material characteristics of the ac the characteristics of the target mp and the presence of background organic matter the material characteristics known to influence the adsorption process are i the size ii the pore size distribution and iii the surface chemistry of the ac smaller carbon e g pac is characterized by a shorter diffusion path and a larger specific external surface area compared to gac this translates into faster adsorption kinetics matsui et al 2013 nowotny et al 2007 sontheimer et al 1988 on the contrary the adsorption capacity at equilibrium is not clearly increasing with decreasing particle size matsui et al 2009 pan et al 2017 matsui et al have shown that the adsorption capacity actually increases with increasing ac size for large molecules such as natural organic matter matsui et al 2015 pan et al 2017 in terms of the kinetics of adsorption cnp should be the best option as these particles offer a high external specific surface area without diffusion limitation however the particle size is so small that aggregation of cnp is a challenge which compromises the theoretical advantages of cnp over pac and spac ellerie et al 2013 nguyen et al 2020 zhang et al 2009 the influence of the size on the adsorption of pollutants for pac and spac has been described in several works pan et al 2017 partlan et al 2016 on the other hand systematic investigations on the gac size and its implication in the adsorption kinetics in fixed bed are rare and inspiration from other applications such as chromatography is required for example the use of smaller beads to improve the separation efficiency in packed bed columns is well known kempe et al 1999 and implemented in processes such as analytical chromatography porous morphology and surface chemistry depend on the precursor material and the activation process longer activation leads to an increase in the specific surface area and pore volume due to the formation of interconnected micropores 2 nm li et al 2008 indeed li et al li et al 2002 have concluded that mp adsorbs primary in micropores thus the ideal adsorbent should exhibit a large volume of micropores with widths that are about 1 3 to 1 8 times larger than the kinetic diameter of the target mp nevertheless the broadening of the pores may be beneficial for the adsorption process of larger molecules li et al li et al 2018 managed to increase the adsorption capacity from 374 to 842 mg g 1 of ac for rhodamine b by physical activation with co2 and consequent pores broadening the surface chemistry is highly dependent on the precursor material a vast range of heteroatoms o p k n content is reported in the literature e g for oxygen from 2 to 20 benaddi et al 2000 budinova et al 2006 phan et al 2006 wang et al 2005 it has been reported that a higher oxygen content enhances water adsorption wetting on the carbon surface de ridder et al 2010 li et al 2002 reducing the hydrophobic interactions between the mp and ac as a consequence the equilibrium adsorption capacity of hydrophobic pollutants such as 2 methylisoborneol and trichloroethylene is reduced at a higher oxygen content on the contrary the influence of ac oxygen species on adsorption kinetics rather than the equilibrium adsorption capacity was not discussed by these authors pbsac is produced by carbonization and steam activation of polymeric spherical precursors compared to conventional ac it presents unique opportunities to tailor the material characteristics to the specific application böhringer et al 2011 first it can be produced in different diameters simply starting with polymeric precursors of different sizes second the use of polymeric precursors compared to agricultural waste for example with defined and reproducible properties allows better control of the surface chemistry of the ac klefer et al 2016 sobiesiak et al 2006 tagliavini et al tagliavini et al 2017 have characterized pbsac with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy showing that it is composed mainly of carbon with a relatively small fraction of oxygen 1 4 research questions in previous work the feasibility of the uf pbsac was presented using the commercial pbsac filter mat on the permeate side of uf tagliavini and schäfer 2018 in this work the same configuration is used but the pbsac is used as a millimetric packed layer in this way the layer will be composed only of carbon and the influence of pbsac material properties on the adsorption of four steroid mp will be assessed initially the layer configuration is studied from a macroscopic point of view by varying the size of the pbsac further the influence of pbsac nano and molecular scale properties is considered by varying the pore morphology and the oxygen content specifically the following research questions will be addressed i how will the pbsac material characteristics affect the removal of steroid hormone in the uf pbsac process ii what is the implication of pbsac material characteristics on kinetics and capacity iii what is the role of the internal porous structure activation degree on the process 2 materials methods 2 1 ultrafiltration membranes a uf regenerated cellulose membrane plhgc millipore bedford usa with a molecular weight cut off mwco of 10 kda was coupled with the pbsac layer the membrane was chosen based on negligible hormones adsorption and retention of other water parameters such as viruses bacteria and the larger fractions humic substances of organic matter tagliavini and schäfer 2018 wolters et al 2019 2 2 polymer based spherical activated carbon pbsac particles and mat cross linked polystyrene was used as a precursor for the polymer based spherical activated carbon pbsac material von blücher 2006 the synthesis was carried out in a batch process it took place in a rotary kiln reactor the process includes a carbonization step and a subsequent activation step with oxidizing agents to establish pore volume by controlled oxidation of carbon at 1173 k the used oxidizing agent steam influenced the pore size distribution böhringer et al 2011 fichtner 2009 von blücher 2006 pbsac particles were prepared for i six distinct activation levels 1 to 5 at a diameter of 200 μm and 6 at a diameter of 450 μm corresponding to longer exposure time in the reactor ii six particle sizes with diameters of 80 to 640 μm and iii two further samples with increased and reduced oxygen content with intermediate activation and a diameter of 200 μm the oxygen content was increased by treatment in synthetic air at 450 c for 4 h and reduced by a treatment in a hydrogen stream at 800 c for 4 h the tap density and the bet specific surface area of these samples provided by the manufacturer are reported in table 2 the pbsac mat filter is a commercial material mainly used for air treatment a water soluble glue is used to stick the pbsac together and obtain a dense filter mat with a thickness of 2 2 mm the diameter of pbsac in the mat has a size of 450 μm 2 3 dynamic adsorption experiments a stirred cell filtration set up typically used for dead end membrane filtration was adapted to perform dynamic adsorption experiments in the uf pbsac the system is composed of a bottom part a cell and a top part fig 1 in the bottom part a stainless steel porous support is first placed then the desired amount of pbsac is poured inside followed by gentle tapping to obtain a uniform layer finally the uf is placed on the top of the pbsac layer for more details see figure si 1 bottom parts with different heights were produced kit germany to hold pbsac layers of thickness 1 2 4 and 6 mm the diameter of the layer is always 65 mm the volume of the adsorbent layer inside the bottom part varies from 3 3 cm3 for a thickness of 1 mm to 19 9 cm3 for a thickness of 6 mm the mass of pbsac in the layer depends on the volume and the tap density of each sample reported in table 2 as shown in table si 1 the cell is put on the bottom part and is filled with the feed solution last the system is sealed with the top part that is connected to a synthetic air tank used to pressurize the cell in the top part a thermocouple tj2 cpss m60u 250 sb omega engineering germany and a pressure transducer px219 30v85g5v omega engineering germany are located to monitor the temperature and the pressure inside the cell permeate mass is measured by an electronic balance adventurer pro av 2102 ohaus germany data is collected by a computer with a data acquisition module labview 2014 national instruments germany dynamic adsorption experiments were carried out at different fluxes 100 200 and 400 l m 2 h 1 which correspond to different contact time between mp and pbsac as previously reported in the uf pbsac the uf controls the permeability of the process different pressure needs to be applied to achieve the desired flux resulting in the contact times shown in table 3 empty bed contact time ebct and effective contact time are calculated with the following relationship worch 2012 1 e m p t y b e d c o

e 2 4 static adsorption experiments in some cases static adsorption experiments were carried out to clarify the results obtained in dynamic adsorption experiments in particular the static adsorption kinetics of mp on the pbsac samples with varying oxygen content and the adsorption isotherm of mb on the pbsac with different activation degree were measured adsorption kinetics experiments were performed following the same protocol as used in previous work tagliavini et al 2017 the desired pbsac mass for a pbsac concentration of 0 1 g l 1 was poured into 250 ml of mp solution 100 ng l 1 inside a conical flask duran group germany the flask was placed into the incubator shaker innova 43 r new brunswick scientific usa stirring and temperature were set to 260 rpm and 20 c respectively samples were collected from the flask as a function of time the main goal of static adsorption kinetics was to elucidate if the presence of oxygen on the surface influences the adsorption rate considering that oxygen was the only parameter varied the mass transport rate was assumed to not be affected by its presence the transport mechanisms involved in batch adsorption kinetic are film diffusion that depends on the size of the ac and pore diffusion which depends on the porous morphology for this reason a kinetic constant was estimated using a pseudo first order kinetic model adsorption isotherms of methylene blue mb for different pbsac samples were performed in the incubator shaker at 260 rpm and 20 c and volume of 100 ml the initial concentration of mb used ranges from 10 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 and the pbsac concentration was 0 5 g l 1 equilibrium time was 96 h for loose pbsac and 120 h for the pbsac mat 2 5 chemicals and solution chemistry four steroid hormones were used as model pollutants namely estradiol e2 estrone e1 progesterone p and testosterone t purchased from perkin elmer usa as tritium labeled compounds native steroid hormone mp solutions have a concentration of 3 mg l 1 and are dissolved in ethanol a stock solution with a concentration of 10 μg l 1 was prepared for each mp diluting 300 times the native mp solutions in milliq water type 1 iso 3696 merck millipore germany feed solutions of 100 ng l 1 for each mp were prepared by dilution of the 10 μg l 1 stock solution with the background electrolyte consisting of 1 mm nahco3 bernd kraft germany 99 7 purity and 10 mm nacl vwr chemicals germany 99 9 purity for the determination of the maximum adsorption capacity of pbsac not achievable with steroid hormones due to the low solubility in water methylene blue sigma aldrich germany 99 was used a stock solution of 5 g l 1 was prepared by dissolving 5 g of mb in 1000 ml of milliq water solutions from 10 to 500 mg l 1 were prepared by dilution of the stock solution in milliq water and used to obtain the adsorption isotherm of mb on pbsac 2 6 analytical methods a liquid scintillation counter lsc was used to measure the tritium activity of feed and permeate samples the activity was correlated to the mp concentration through a calibration curve as reported in previous works tagliavini and schäfer 2018 wolters et al 2019 the analysis is characterized by a limit of detection of 0 05 ng l 1 as shown in figure si 2 a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa was used to measure the absorbance of mb solution at the wavelength of 664 nm mb concentration was determined from absorbance through a calibration curve 2 7 material characterization thermo scientific k alpha spectrometer was used to acquire the xps spectra the monochromatic alkα line was used as x ray excitation 1486 6 ev with pass energy of 50 ev to obtain high resolution spectra the samples were analyzed using a microfocused monochromated al kα x ray source 40 µm spot size xps spectra were fit with one or more voigt profiles binding energy uncertainty 0 2 ev and scofield sensitivity factors were applied for quantification scofield 1979 all spectra were referenced to the c 1 s peak c c at 284 50 ev binding energy zou et al 2016 controlled by means of the photoelectron peaks of metallic cu ag and au respectively the carbon c1s spectra were done at the beginning and end of each resolution analysis to check the absence of any sample degradations under irradiation to characterize the porous morphology argon adsorption desorption data was collected at 87 k autosorb1 mp quantachrome usa prior to analysis pbsac samples were degassed at 300 c in vacuum for 24 h specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined for different pbsac activation degrees using non local density functional theory model nldft method which is considered more consistent for microporous materials compared to the classical bet model centeno and stoeckli 2010 two pore models for carbon were compared namely slit like and a mixture of spherical and cylindrical pore shapes 3 results and discussion as previous work has focused on filtration through the ready made filter mat provided by blücher in this work loose particles were used as a packed layer hence as a first investigation the difference in the breakthrough curve between the pbsac filter mat and the packed layer was investigated this is followed by the influence of the material properties of pbsac activation and size and its implications on the process 3 1 e2 breakthrough curve through the pbsac layer the comparison between the breakthrough curves of e2 in a pbsac mat and a pbsac packed layer of the same particle diameter 450 μm is reported in fig 2 the thickness of the adsorbing bed is 2 2 mm for the pbsac filter mat and 2 mm for the packed layer of pbsac this corresponds to an ebct of 79 and 72 s respectively fig 2 shows that the shape of the breakthrough curve is the same in both cases this shape is a characteristic of the early adsorption stage typical of this process tagliavini and schäfer 2018 wolters et al 2019 on the contrary the permeate concentration of e2 is reduced from 40 ng l 1 for the pbsac mat to 6 7 ng l 1 for the packed pbsac layer the adsorption process is clearly improved when pbsac is packed in the layer without the use of the glue the presence of the glue within pbsac particles in the mat deteriorates the adsorption either by reducing the contact time by filling the void volume or reducing the adsorption capacity from the breakthrough of a non adsorbing compound nacl the real contact time appears to be reduced for the pbsac mat as shown in figure si 4 the effect of the glue on the adsorption capacity of pbsac within the mat was also investigated the maximum adsorption capacity for mb is reduced for the pbsac within the mat showing that the glue may block part of the pbsac surface and internal porosity figure si 5 the effect of the glue on the contact time remains the strongest explanation for the results in fig 2 considering that the capacity in this early adsorption stage is not a limiting factor all subsequent work will be carried out with a packed pbsac layer the removal at the end 600 ml of permeate of the dynamic adsorption experiments used as the performance parameter tagliavini and schäfer 2018 the first property to be investigated is the pbsac diameter which affects the mass transport of the pollutant in the thin packed layer 3 2 influence of the pbsac diameter in the removal of estradiol varying the diameter of pbsac within the layer corresponds to vary the external surface area available for adsorption this was correlated with the diameter of the particle assuming a layer porosity of 0 4 eq si 1 and table si 3 the external surface area in a 2 mm layer increases from 0 04 to 0 31 m2 by decreasing the pbsac size from 640 μm to 80 μm in fig 3 an influence of the pbsac diameter on the removal of e2 can be observed at both fluxes removal increases from 89 to 99 at 100 l m 2 h 1 and 71 to 97 at 400 l m 2 h 1 with decreasing particle diameter from 640 to 80 μm the influence of particle diameter is stronger at the higher flux where residence time 7 to 9 s is more challenging for the adsorption permeate concentrations are the lowest at small particle size with the lowest concentration of 1 ng l 1 reached at 100 l m 2 h 1 and a particle diameter of 80 μm higher removal is related to an improved mass transfer regime consequence of the larger external surface area immediately accessible present in the layer at smaller pbsac size these results are significant considering the restrictive guideline of 1 ng l 1 further the importance of mass transport within the layer is high when such high removal needs to be achieved in short contact time the implication of pbsac diameter on the required pbsac layer thickness was considered permeate e2 concentrations with increasing thickness for a medium flux of 200 l m 2 h 1 are reported in fig 4 for three particle diameters and compared with the relevant who recommendation for e2 in drinking water estradiol concentration can be reduced below the drinking water standard of 1 ng l 1 for a maximum feed conc of 100 ng l 1 for pbsac diameters of 80 and 200 μm the minimum thickness to meet the guideline value is 4 mm and 6 mm for pbsac diameter of 80 and 200 μm respectively the guideline value cannot be reached with the large pbsac particles 640 μm even for a 6 mm layer due to the unfavorable mass transfer regime within the layer in summary these results indicate that the size of the ac has an important role in fixed bed adsorption the overall kinetic can be improved by using smaller ac this should be taken into account especially in processes where the adsorption should effectively occur in a thin bed rather than a traditional gac filter for the uf pbsac in particular the use of smaller pbsac does not affect the overall permeability of the process because this is completely determined by the uf membrane tagliavini and schäfer 2018 in the subsequent section the activation process of pbsac will be characterized and the influence of activation on the dynamic adsorption of e2 investigated for a layer thickness of 2 mm 3 3 influence of the pbsac activation in the removal of estradiol to characterize the development of the porous morphology during the activation process specific surface area pore volume and pore size distribution were obtained from argon adsorption data the dft model was used to fit the data using either slit or cylindrical pore geometry fig 5 shows that the specific surface area and the pore volume follow a similar trend with both models the model based on slit pores predicts an increase of the specific surface area and the pore volume from 1103 m2 g 1 and 0 331 cm3 g 1 a1 to 1867 m2 g 1 and 1 040 cm3 g 1 a6 respectively using cylindrical pores geometry the model predicted a specific surface increases from 1205 to 1950 m2 g 1 and predicted pore volume from 0 337 to 1 200 cm3 g 1 fig 5 the pore size distributions of all the samples are reported in figure si 6 the slit pores based model performs better and predicts smaller pore width compared to the spherical cylindrical pores one as shown in table 4 in both cases the micropores fraction increases with the activation degree spherical cylindrical pores model predicts a relevant fraction of mesopores in the sample a5 and a6 33 and 51 respectively however pores larger than 5 nm were not detected and it can be concluded that the pbsac material is mostly microporous the influence of increasing activation on the removal of e2 in dynamic adsorption experiments is reported in fig 6 the removal of e2 is not affected by the activation as shown in fig 6a for activation 6 the drop in the removal was attributed to a larger pbsac diameter rather than the activation the uptake fig 6c increases as a function of activation proportionally to the decrease of the tap density e g loading is lower for high activation at constant layer volume table si 1 these results suggest that the internal porous morphology of the pbsac does not influence the adsorption of hormones at these concentrations the overall adsorption kinetics is controlled by the external surface area of pbsac determined by its diameter in the past some authors p cornel and j fettig reported by sontheimer et al 1988 have also concluded that the initial stage of the breakthrough is determined by the film diffusion mechanism only which in terms is related to the external surface area however the porous morphology and the diffusion mechanism are expected to play a role when the adsorption process is carried out for a longer time to clarify the role of activation on the performance of pbsac the adsorption isotherm of mb on pbsac with different activation was measured the maximum adsorption capacity of mb increases from 28 mg g 1 activation 1 to 582 mg g 1 activation 6 as shown in figure si 7 therefore the activation of pbsac does not influence the early adsorption tested but it is expected to determine the maximum adsorption capacity hence the lifetime of a pbsac layer 3 4 influence of oxygen content in the removal of steroid mp the last property of pbsac investigated is its surface chemistry which was characterized by means of xps survey xps spectra show that pbsac samples are exclusively composed of carbon c 1 s and oxygen o 1 s figure si 8 the amount of oxygen was quantified in all the samples used in this work table si 4 the atomic ranges from 2 9 to 8 with an average of 5 the pbsac samples where the oxygen was intentionally increased and decreases have an oxygen content of 9 1 and 1 5 respectively the o1s spectra for standard increased and decreased oxygen content fig 7 shows three peaks from all oxygenated species present at the surface a characteristic o 1 s peak is observed at 531 6 ev which corresponds to c o environment of oxygen the two others peaks one at 533 2 ev is attributed to co c environment of oxygen and another one at 535 8 ev indicating the presence of water molecules adsorbed narrow component zielke et al 1996 in order to verify if the oxygen content is a factor in the adsorption e2 three pbsacs with the same diameter 200 μm and 3 oxygen levels 1 5 4 1 9 1 were tested beyond e2 three other hormones namely estrone e1 testosterone t and progesterone p were used in this section for comparison see table 5 fig 8 shows that a significant influence of oxygen is observed on the adsorption of e2 only where the removal decreases from 99 for an o content of 9 1 to 86 for an o content of 1 5 at a standard o content of 4 1 the removal of e1 t and p is higher compared to e2 further no clear trend on the influence of oxygen is observable for e1 t and p this may be because the removal is 96 and hence so high that oxygen influence cannot be observed even at a flux of 400 l m 2 h 1 to clarify the influence of oxygen static adsorption kinetic experiments were carried out for the 4 hormones and the 2 extreme oxygen contents 1 5 and 9 1 static adsorption results are reported for the four hormones in figure si 9 removal at equilibrium contact time of 26 h is not significantly affected by o content for all hormones on the contrary the pseudo first oder kinetic constant is affected by the presence of oxygen depending on the hormone table 5 focusing on the difference in the adsorption kinetic constant between high and low o content in table 5 this difference follows the trend e2 e1 t p that is in accordance with the oh bonding potential of the 4 hormones e2 e1 t p the formation of h bonds between the hydroxyl groups of the hormones and the oxygen species on the pbsac surface may explain the adsorption kinetic enhancement for e2 and moderately for e1 and t this would explain the results of dynamic adsorption experiments in fig 8 as for the pbsac size the required layer thickness to reach the 1 ng l 1 target was compared for an adsorbing layer composed by pbsac with standard and increased oxygen in fig 9 increasing the oxygen allows reducing the layer from 6 to around 4 mm to comply with the recommended e2 guideline value of 1 ng l 1 the relevance of the adsorption kinetic may be peculiar to the thin layer adsorption or short contact time approach proposed in this work for typical ac columns where the contact time is in the range 5 to 30 min 18 the limitation by adsorption kinetics hence on the initial removal is not a common phenomenon in summary the surface chemistry of pbsac was shown to be an interesting property to improve the process and obtain the target pollutant permeate concentration at a reduced pbsac layer thickness however the mechanism that enhances the adsorption of e2 at higher o content was not fully understood in this work the hypothesis proposed is that the adsorption rate rather than the mass transport rate was improved due to hydrogen bonding interactions between the carbon surface and the hydroxyl group present on e2 target studies of the surface chemistry influence on the adsorption of different micropollutants are needed to elucidate the potential of the surface chemistry modification 4 conclusions the systematic investigation of the material properties of pbsac was successfully carried out to improve the adsorption performance of a thin pbsac layer compared to the previous work tagliavini and schäfer 2018 the adsorption of estradiol can be achieved with a millimetric permeate side pbsac layer reaching the ambitious target of 1 ng l 1 the size of pbsac within the layer is the parameter that most influences the adsorption of hormones smaller pbsac in terms of diameters reduces the required layer thickness to 4 6 mm achieving still the target permeate concentration for a high feed of 100 ng l 1 pbsac activation does not affect the initial removal of e2 but it influences the maximum adsorption capacity achievable for mb thus the increasing microporous volume developed during the activation process affects mainly the equilibrium capacity but not the adsorption kinetics as was previously reported for pac by newcombe et al newcombe et al 2002 the investigation of the surface chemistry of pbsac resulted in relevant outcomes in that increasing the oxygen content on the adsorbent surface enhances the adsorption kinetic of estradiol due to hydrogen bonding formation the implication of this phenomenon is once again the possibility to reduce the required layer thickness in order to reach the target estradiol concentration in the permeate the combination of uf with a permeate side pbsac layer is a simple and efficient process to remove a micropollutant like the hormone estradiol from water beyond the satisfying performances this approach presents several advantages compared to other competing technologies i the process runs at lower pressure compared to reverse osmosis and nanofiltration ii it presents smaller footprint and lower carbon consumption

17618,the european union has proposed the value of 1 ng l 1 as a drinking water quality standard for estradiol with conventional technologies only partially removing estradiol the investigation of novel alternatives is more than ever required tagliavini and schäfer proposed that the use of a thin activated carbon layer combined with a membrane is worth considering in this work the process was further advanced through a systematic investigation of the role of activated carbon size activation and surface chemistry on the removal of estradiol the use of smaller carbon particles allows reaching the ambitious target value of 1 ng l 1 in a millimetric layer further adsorption kinetic enhancement by increasing the oxygen content on the carbon improves the removal from 96 to 99 for a layer of 2 mm for oh containing pollutants such as estradiol high removal together with low pressure and no by product formation are characteristics that make the uf pbsac a promising and competitive

laurenson et al 2014 for other endocrine disrupters pnec is generally higher apart from the synthetic hormone ethinyl estradiol ee2 whose reported pnec ranges from 0 035 to 0 35 ng l 1 caldwell et al 2008 laurenson et al 2014 in 2011 the european commission proposed environmental quality standards eqs for e2 and ee2 of 0 4 and 0 035 ng l 1 respectively europeancommision 2011 further a drinking water quality standards of 1 ng l 1 was proposed for e2 europeancommision 2018 as advised by the world health organization who in its potable reuse document the who recommends a multiple barrier treatment consisting of membrane filtration micro and ultrafiltration mf uf and reverse osmosis ro uv disinfection and advanced oxidation processes aop who 2017 an example of this approach can be found in the newater treatment plant in singapore the combination of mf uf ro and uv disinfection allows reducing the concentration of e2 below 1 ng l 1 seah et al 2008 the high energy consumption of ro demands the development of more permeable processes such as nanofiltration nf radjenovic et al 2008 schäfer et al 2003 however not all nf membranes can achieve complete removal of neutral mp because of mp sorption to the polymer membrane and subsequent diffusion nghiem et al 2004 novel nf membranes are under investigation to overcome this limitation guo et al 2017 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b advanced oxidation processes such as ozonation are effectively removing mp while producing by products adsorption is considered the most suitable option for drinking water because it avoids the formation of such by products margot et al 2013 1 2 activated carbon adsorption activated carbon adsorption is a well known technology for removing mp from water sontheimer et al 1988 worch 2012 activated carbon ac is classified based on the size in granular gac 0 4 5 mm powdered pac 40 μm and super powdered spac 1 μm 100 nm activated carbon besides carbon based nanoparticle cnp 20 μm 1 nm ihsanullah 2019 tabish et al 2018 is receiving increasing attention as an effective adsorbent for mp nguyen et al 2020 the size of the ac is strongly related to the application technique gac is typically arranged in a fixed bed in what is referred to as gac filter altmann et al 2016 meinel et al 2014 paredes et al 2018 rostvall et al 2018 zietzschmann et al 2016 on the other side it is not practibable to use pac in a fixed bed the particle size is too small to allow good water permeation and the possible leakage of the ac alongside the treated water is an issue typically pac is continuously dosed as a slurry and removed via coagulation flocculation application of pac in a continuous process can also be achieved in the pac uf hybrid process where the uf is used to separate the particles from the treated water stoquart et al 2012 some examples of smaller carbon adsorbents compared to gac used as a fixed bed has been reported in literature as shown in table 1 for instance ruhl et al ruhl et al 2014 successfully integrated pac in a pumice deep filter recalling the so called haberer process published in 1991 haberer and normann schmidt 1991 the process was applied to the removal of several pharmaceuticals and other mp showing that removal was enhanced with immobilized pac compared to batch additional examples demonstrate the integration of pac spac and cnp in a polymeric membrane other reserchers amaral et al 2016 ellerie et al 2013 have coated a porous membrane uf or mf with pac spac and cnp for the removal of methylene blue and atrazine wu et al wu et al 2017 introduced the concept of a dynamic pac membrane where the pac is deposited as a fouling layer on the feed side of the mf however the purpose of this process was fouling control rather than mp removal finally several other examples can be found in which carbon nanoparticles are loaded within the membrane matrix before the casting process e g crock et al 2013 tagliavini and schäfer have proposed a novel approach to combine ac and membranes polymer based spherical activated carbon pbsac which had previously shown fast adsorption kinetics towards mp tagliavini et al 2017 is used as a thin millimetric layer placed on the permeate side of a uf membrane uf pbsac this permeate side approach presents some advantages compared to previously reported processes combining membrane and ac pbsac with a diameter of 450 μm was used in the form of a filter mat commercially used for protective clothes and filtration of odors böhringer et al 2011 adsorption of mp was demonstrated to be effective even in the thin layer mp removals were in the range of 60 to 80 at an empty bed contact time ebct of only 1 min tagliavini and schäfer 2018 the limitation in the maximum adsorption capacity deriving from the thin layer was not important due to the typically low mp concentration used further the process was shown to remove mp and natural organic matter simultaneously wolters et al 2019 1 3 material characteristics of activated carbon size pore morphology and surface chemistry the adsorption of mp onto ac depends on the material characteristics of the ac the characteristics of the target mp and the presence of background organic matter the material characteristics known to influence the adsorption process are i the size ii the pore size distribution and iii the surface chemistry of the ac smaller carbon e g pac is characterized by a shorter diffusion path and a larger specific external surface area compared to gac this translates into faster adsorption kinetics matsui et al 2013 nowotny et al 2007 sontheimer et al 1988 on the contrary the adsorption capacity at equilibrium is not clearly increasing with decreasing particle size matsui et al 2009 pan et al 2017 matsui et al have shown that the adsorption capacity actually increases with increasing ac size for large molecules such as natural organic matter matsui et al 2015 pan et al 2017 in terms of the kinetics of adsorption cnp should be the best option as these particles offer a high external specific surface area without diffusion limitation however the particle size is so small that aggregation of cnp is a challenge which compromises the theoretical advantages of cnp over pac and spac ellerie et al 2013 nguyen et al 2020 zhang et al 2009 the influence of the size on the adsorption of pollutants for pac and spac has been described in several works pan et al 2017 partlan et al 2016 on the other hand systematic investigations on the gac size and its implication in the adsorption kinetics in fixed bed are rare and inspiration from other applications such as chromatography is required for example the use of smaller beads to improve the separation efficiency in packed bed columns is well known kempe et al 1999 and implemented in processes such as analytical chromatography porous morphology and surface chemistry depend on the precursor material and the activation process longer activation leads to an increase in the specific surface area and pore volume due to the formation of interconnected micropores 2 nm li et al 2008 indeed li et al li et al 2002 have concluded that mp adsorbs primary in micropores thus the ideal adsorbent should exhibit a large volume of micropores with widths that are about 1 3 to 1 8 times larger than the kinetic diameter of the target mp nevertheless the broadening of the pores may be beneficial for the adsorption process of larger molecules li et al li et al 2018 managed to increase the adsorption capacity from 374 to 842 mg g 1 of ac for rhodamine b by physical activation with co2 and consequent pores broadening the surface chemistry is highly dependent on the precursor material a vast range of heteroatoms o p k n content is reported in the literature e g for oxygen from 2 to 20 benaddi et al 2000 budinova et al 2006 phan et al 2006 wang et al 2005 it has been reported that a higher oxygen content enhances water adsorption wetting on the carbon surface de ridder et al 2010 li et al 2002 reducing the hydrophobic interactions between the mp and ac as a consequence the equilibrium adsorption capacity of hydrophobic pollutants such as 2 methylisoborneol and trichloroethylene is reduced at a higher oxygen content on the contrary the influence of ac oxygen species on adsorption kinetics rather than the equilibrium adsorption capacity was not discussed by these authors pbsac is produced by carbonization and steam activation of polymeric spherical precursors compared to conventional ac it presents unique opportunities to tailor the material characteristics to the specific application böhringer et al 2011 first it can be produced in different diameters simply starting with polymeric precursors of different sizes second the use of polymeric precursors compared to agricultural waste for example with defined and reproducible properties allows better control of the surface chemistry of the ac klefer et al 2016 sobiesiak et al 2006 tagliavini et al tagliavini et al 2017 have characterized pbsac with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy showing that it is composed mainly of carbon with a relatively small fraction of oxygen 1 4 research questions in previous work the feasibility of the uf pbsac was presented using the commercial pbsac filter mat on the permeate side of uf tagliavini and schäfer 2018 in this work the same configuration is used but the pbsac is used as a millimetric packed layer in this way the layer will be composed only of carbon and the influence of pbsac material properties on the adsorption of four steroid mp will be assessed initially the layer configuration is studied from a macroscopic point of view by varying the size of the pbsac further the influence of pbsac nano and molecular scale properties is considered by varying the pore morphology and the oxygen content specifically the following research questions will be addressed i how will the pbsac material characteristics affect the removal of steroid hormone in the uf pbsac process ii what is the implication of pbsac material characteristics on kinetics and capacity iii what is the role of the internal porous structure activation degree on the process 2 materials methods 2 1 ultrafiltration membranes a uf regenerated cellulose membrane plhgc millipore bedford usa with a molecular weight cut off mwco of 10 kda was coupled with the pbsac layer the membrane was chosen based on negligible hormones adsorption and retention of other water parameters such as viruses bacteria and the larger fractions humic substances of organic matter tagliavini and schäfer 2018 wolters et al 2019 2 2 polymer based spherical activated carbon pbsac particles and mat cross linked polystyrene was used as a precursor for the polymer based spherical activated carbon pbsac material von blücher 2006 the synthesis was carried out in a batch process it took place in a rotary kiln reactor the process includes a carbonization step and a subsequent activation step with oxidizing agents to establish pore volume by controlled oxidation of carbon at 1173 k the used oxidizing agent steam influenced the pore size distribution böhringer et al 2011 fichtner 2009 von blücher 2006 pbsac particles were prepared for i six distinct activation levels 1 to 5 at a diameter of 200 μm and 6 at a diameter of 450 μm corresponding to longer exposure time in the reactor ii six particle sizes with diameters of 80 to 640 μm and iii two further samples with increased and reduced oxygen content with intermediate activation and a diameter of 200 μm the oxygen content was increased by treatment in synthetic air at 450 c for 4 h and reduced by a treatment in a hydrogen stream at 800 c for 4 h the tap density and the bet specific surface area of these samples provided by the manufacturer are reported in table 2 the pbsac mat filter is a commercial material mainly used for air treatment a water soluble glue is used to stick the pbsac together and obtain a dense filter mat with a thickness of 2 2 mm the diameter of pbsac in the mat has a size of 450 μm 2 3 dynamic adsorption experiments a stirred cell filtration set up typically used for dead end membrane filtration was adapted to perform dynamic adsorption experiments in the uf pbsac the system is composed of a bottom part a cell and a top part fig 1 in the bottom part a stainless steel porous support is first placed then the desired amount of pbsac is poured inside followed by gentle tapping to obtain a uniform layer finally the uf is placed on the top of the pbsac layer for more details see figure si 1 bottom parts with different heights were produced kit germany to hold pbsac layers of thickness 1 2 4 and 6 mm the diameter of the layer is always 65 mm the volume of the adsorbent layer inside the bottom part varies from 3 3 cm3 for a thickness of 1 mm to 19 9 cm3 for a thickness of 6 mm the mass of pbsac in the layer depends on the volume and the tap density of each sample reported in table 2 as shown in table si 1 the cell is put on the bottom part and is filled with the feed solution last the system is sealed with the top part that is connected to a synthetic air tank used to pressurize the cell in the top part a thermocouple tj2 cpss m60u 250 sb omega engineering germany and a pressure transducer px219 30v85g5v omega engineering germany are located to monitor the temperature and the pressure inside the cell permeate mass is measured by an electronic balance adventurer pro av 2102 ohaus germany data is collected by a computer with a data acquisition module labview 2014 national instruments germany dynamic adsorption experiments were carried out at different fluxes 100 200 and 400 l m 2 h 1 which correspond to different contact time between mp and pbsac as previously reported in the uf pbsac the uf controls the permeability of the process different pressure needs to be applied to achieve the desired flux resulting in the contact times shown in table 3 empty bed contact time ebct and effective contact time are calculated with the following relationship worch 2012 1 e m p t y b e d c o

e 2 4 static adsorption experiments in some cases static adsorption experiments were carried out to clarify the results obtained in dynamic adsorption experiments in particular the static adsorption kinetics of mp on the pbsac samples with varying oxygen content and the adsorption isotherm of mb on the pbsac with different activation degree were measured adsorption kinetics experiments were performed following the same protocol as used in previous work tagliavini et al 2017 the desired pbsac mass for a pbsac concentration of 0 1 g l 1 was poured into 250 ml of mp solution 100 ng l 1 inside a conical flask duran group germany the flask was placed into the incubator shaker innova 43 r new brunswick scientific usa stirring and temperature were set to 260 rpm and 20 c respectively samples were collected from the flask as a function of time the main goal of static adsorption kinetics was to elucidate if the presence of oxygen on the surface influences the adsorption rate considering that oxygen was the only parameter varied the mass transport rate was assumed to not be affected by its presence the transport mechanisms involved in batch adsorption kinetic are film diffusion that depends on the size of the ac and pore diffusion which depends on the porous morphology for this reason a kinetic constant was estimated using a pseudo first order kinetic model adsorption isotherms of methylene blue mb for different pbsac samples were performed in the incubator shaker at 260 rpm and 20 c and volume of 100 ml the initial concentration of mb used ranges from 10 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 and the pbsac concentration was 0 5 g l 1 equilibrium time was 96 h for loose pbsac and 120 h for the pbsac mat 2 5 chemicals and solution chemistry four steroid hormones were used as model pollutants namely estradiol e2 estrone e1 progesterone p and testosterone t purchased from perkin elmer usa as tritium labeled compounds native steroid hormone mp solutions have a concentration of 3 mg l 1 and are dissolved in ethanol a stock solution with a concentration of 10 μg l 1 was prepared for each mp diluting 300 times the native mp solutions in milliq water type 1 iso 3696 merck millipore germany feed solutions of 100 ng l 1 for each mp were prepared by dilution of the 10 μg l 1 stock solution with the background electrolyte consisting of 1 mm nahco3 bernd kraft germany 99 7 purity and 10 mm nacl vwr chemicals germany 99 9 purity for the determination of the maximum adsorption capacity of pbsac not achievable with steroid hormones due to the low solubility in water methylene blue sigma aldrich germany 99 was used a stock solution of 5 g l 1 was prepared by dissolving 5 g of mb in 1000 ml of milliq water solutions from 10 to 500 mg l 1 were prepared by dilution of the stock solution in milliq water and used to obtain the adsorption isotherm of mb on pbsac 2 6 analytical methods a liquid scintillation counter lsc was used to measure the tritium activity of feed and permeate samples the activity was correlated to the mp concentration through a calibration curve as reported in previous works tagliavini and schäfer 2018 wolters et al 2019 the analysis is characterized by a limit of detection of 0 05 ng l 1 as shown in figure si 2 a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa was used to measure the absorbance of mb solution at the wavelength of 664 nm mb concentration was determined from absorbance through a calibration curve 2 7 material characterization thermo scientific k alpha spectrometer was used to acquire the xps spectra the monochromatic alkα line was used as x ray excitation 1486 6 ev with pass energy of 50 ev to obtain high resolution spectra the samples were analyzed using a microfocused monochromated al kα x ray source 40 µm spot size xps spectra were fit with one or more voigt profiles binding energy uncertainty 0 2 ev and scofield sensitivity factors were applied for quantification scofield 1979 all spectra were referenced to the c 1 s peak c c at 284 50 ev binding energy zou et al 2016 controlled by means of the photoelectron peaks of metallic cu ag and au respectively the carbon c1s spectra were done at the beginning and end of each resolution analysis to check the absence of any sample degradations under irradiation to characterize the porous morphology argon adsorption desorption data was collected at 87 k autosorb1 mp quantachrome usa prior to analysis pbsac samples were degassed at 300 c in vacuum for 24 h specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined for different pbsac activation degrees using non local density functional theory model nldft method which is considered more consistent for microporous materials compared to the classical bet model centeno and stoeckli 2010 two pore models for carbon were compared namely slit like and a mixture of spherical and cylindrical pore shapes 3 results and discussion as previous work has focused on filtration through the ready made filter mat provided by blücher in this work loose particles were used as a packed layer hence as a first investigation the difference in the breakthrough curve between the pbsac filter mat and the packed layer was investigated this is followed by the influence of the material properties of pbsac activation and size and its implications on the process 3 1 e2 breakthrough curve through the pbsac layer the comparison between the breakthrough curves of e2 in a pbsac mat and a pbsac packed layer of the same particle diameter 450 μm is reported in fig 2 the thickness of the adsorbing bed is 2 2 mm for the pbsac filter mat and 2 mm for the packed layer of pbsac this corresponds to an ebct of 79 and 72 s respectively fig 2 shows that the shape of the breakthrough curve is the same in both cases this shape is a characteristic of the early adsorption stage typical of this process tagliavini and schäfer 2018 wolters et al 2019 on the contrary the permeate concentration of e2 is reduced from 40 ng l 1 for the pbsac mat to 6 7 ng l 1 for the packed pbsac layer the adsorption process is clearly improved when pbsac is packed in the layer without the use of the glue the presence of the glue within pbsac particles in the mat deteriorates the adsorption either by reducing the contact time by filling the void volume or reducing the adsorption capacity from the breakthrough of a non adsorbing compound nacl the real contact time appears to be reduced for the pbsac mat as shown in figure si 4 the effect of the glue on the adsorption capacity of pbsac within the mat was also investigated the maximum adsorption capacity for mb is reduced for the pbsac within the mat showing that the glue may block part of the pbsac surface and internal porosity figure si 5 the effect of the glue on the contact time remains the strongest explanation for the results in fig 2 considering that the capacity in this early adsorption stage is not a limiting factor all subsequent work will be carried out with a packed pbsac layer the removal at the end 600 ml of permeate of the dynamic adsorption experiments used as the performance parameter tagliavini and schäfer 2018 the first property to be investigated is the pbsac diameter which affects the mass transport of the pollutant in the thin packed layer 3 2 influence of the pbsac diameter in the removal of estradiol varying the diameter of pbsac within the layer corresponds to vary the external surface area available for adsorption this was correlated with the diameter of the particle assuming a layer porosity of 0 4 eq si 1 and table si 3 the external surface area in a 2 mm layer increases from 0 04 to 0 31 m2 by decreasing the pbsac size from 640 μm to 80 μm in fig 3 an influence of the pbsac diameter on the removal of e2 can be observed at both fluxes removal increases from 89 to 99 at 100 l m 2 h 1 and 71 to 97 at 400 l m 2 h 1 with decreasing particle diameter from 640 to 80 μm the influence of particle diameter is stronger at the higher flux where residence time 7 to 9 s is more challenging for the adsorption permeate concentrations are the lowest at small particle size with the lowest concentration of 1 ng l 1 reached at 100 l m 2 h 1 and a particle diameter of 80 μm higher removal is related to an improved mass transfer regime consequence of the larger external surface area immediately accessible present in the layer at smaller pbsac size these results are significant considering the restrictive guideline of 1 ng l 1 further the importance of mass transport within the layer is high when such high removal needs to be achieved in short contact time the implication of pbsac diameter on the required pbsac layer thickness was considered permeate e2 concentrations with increasing thickness for a medium flux of 200 l m 2 h 1 are reported in fig 4 for three particle diameters and compared with the relevant who recommendation for e2 in drinking water estradiol concentration can be reduced below the drinking water standard of 1 ng l 1 for a maximum feed conc of 100 ng l 1 for pbsac diameters of 80 and 200 μm the minimum thickness to meet the guideline value is 4 mm and 6 mm for pbsac diameter of 80 and 200 μm respectively the guideline value cannot be reached with the large pbsac particles 640 μm even for a 6 mm layer due to the unfavorable mass transfer regime within the layer in summary these results indicate that the size of the ac has an important role in fixed bed adsorption the overall kinetic can be improved by using smaller ac this should be taken into account especially in processes where the adsorption should effectively occur in a thin bed rather than a traditional gac filter for the uf pbsac in particular the use of smaller pbsac does not affect the overall permeability of the process because this is completely determined by the uf membrane tagliavini and schäfer 2018 in the subsequent section the activation process of pbsac will be characterized and the influence of activation on the dynamic adsorption of e2 investigated for a layer thickness of 2 mm 3 3 influence of the pbsac activation in the removal of estradiol to characterize the development of the porous morphology during the activation process specific surface area pore volume and pore size distribution were obtained from argon adsorption data the dft model was used to fit the data using either slit or cylindrical pore geometry fig 5 shows that the specific surface area and the pore volume follow a similar trend with both models the model based on slit pores predicts an increase of the specific surface area and the pore volume from 1103 m2 g 1 and 0 331 cm3 g 1 a1 to 1867 m2 g 1 and 1 040 cm3 g 1 a6 respectively using cylindrical pores geometry the model predicted a specific surface increases from 1205 to 1950 m2 g 1 and predicted pore volume from 0 337 to 1 200 cm3 g 1 fig 5 the pore size distributions of all the samples are reported in figure si 6 the slit pores based model performs better and predicts smaller pore width compared to the spherical cylindrical pores one as shown in table 4 in both cases the micropores fraction increases with the activation degree spherical cylindrical pores model predicts a relevant fraction of mesopores in the sample a5 and a6 33 and 51 respectively however pores larger than 5 nm were not detected and it can be concluded that the pbsac material is mostly microporous the influence of increasing activation on the removal of e2 in dynamic adsorption experiments is reported in fig 6 the removal of e2 is not affected by the activation as shown in fig 6a for activation 6 the drop in the removal was attributed to a larger pbsac diameter rather than the activation the uptake fig 6c increases as a function of activation proportionally to the decrease of the tap density e g loading is lower for high activation at constant layer volume table si 1 these results suggest that the internal porous morphology of the pbsac does not influence the adsorption of hormones at these concentrations the overall adsorption kinetics is controlled by the external surface area of pbsac determined by its diameter in the past some authors p cornel and j fettig reported by sontheimer et al 1988 have also concluded that the initial stage of the breakthrough is determined by the film diffusion mechanism only which in terms is related to the external surface area however the porous morphology and the diffusion mechanism are expected to play a role when the adsorption process is carried out for a longer time to clarify the role of activation on the performance of pbsac the adsorption isotherm of mb on pbsac with different activation was measured the maximum adsorption capacity of mb increases from 28 mg g 1 activation 1 to 582 mg g 1 activation 6 as shown in figure si 7 therefore the activation of pbsac does not influence the early adsorption tested but it is expected to determine the maximum adsorption capacity hence the lifetime of a pbsac layer 3 4 influence of oxygen content in the removal of steroid mp the last property of pbsac investigated is its surface chemistry which was characterized by means of xps survey xps spectra show that pbsac samples are exclusively composed of carbon c 1 s and oxygen o 1 s figure si 8 the amount of oxygen was quantified in all the samples used in this work table si 4 the atomic ranges from 2 9 to 8 with an average of 5 the pbsac samples where the oxygen was intentionally increased and decreases have an oxygen content of 9 1 and 1 5 respectively the o1s spectra for standard increased and decreased oxygen content fig 7 shows three peaks from all oxygenated species present at the surface a characteristic o 1 s peak is observed at 531 6 ev which corresponds to c o environment of oxygen the two others peaks one at 533 2 ev is attributed to co c environment of oxygen and another one at 535 8 ev indicating the presence of water molecules adsorbed narrow component zielke et al 1996 in order to verify if the oxygen content is a factor in the adsorption e2 three pbsacs with the same diameter 200 μm and 3 oxygen levels 1 5 4 1 9 1 were tested beyond e2 three other hormones namely estrone e1 testosterone t and progesterone p were used in this section for comparison see table 5 fig 8 shows that a significant influence of oxygen is observed on the adsorption of e2 only where the removal decreases from 99 for an o content of 9 1 to 86 for an o content of 1 5 at a standard o content of 4 1 the removal of e1 t and p is higher compared to e2 further no clear trend on the influence of oxygen is observable for e1 t and p this may be because the removal is 96 and hence so high that oxygen influence cannot be observed even at a flux of 400 l m 2 h 1 to clarify the influence of oxygen static adsorption kinetic experiments were carried out for the 4 hormones and the 2 extreme oxygen contents 1 5 and 9 1 static adsorption results are reported for the four hormones in figure si 9 removal at equilibrium contact time of 26 h is not significantly affected by o content for all hormones on the contrary the pseudo first oder kinetic constant is affected by the presence of oxygen depending on the hormone table 5 focusing on the difference in the adsorption kinetic constant between high and low o content in table 5 this difference follows the trend e2 e1 t p that is in accordance with the oh bonding potential of the 4 hormones e2 e1 t p the formation of h bonds between the hydroxyl groups of the hormones and the oxygen species on the pbsac surface may explain the adsorption kinetic enhancement for e2 and moderately for e1 and t this would explain the results of dynamic adsorption experiments in fig 8 as for the pbsac size the required layer thickness to reach the 1 ng l 1 target was compared for an adsorbing layer composed by pbsac with standard and increased oxygen in fig 9 increasing the oxygen allows reducing the layer from 6 to around 4 mm to comply with the recommended e2 guideline value of 1 ng l 1 the relevance of the adsorption kinetic may be peculiar to the thin layer adsorption or short contact time approach proposed in this work for typical ac columns where the contact time is in the range 5 to 30 min 18 the limitation by adsorption kinetics hence on the initial removal is not a common phenomenon in summary the surface chemistry of pbsac was shown to be an interesting property to improve the process and obtain the target pollutant permeate concentration at a reduced pbsac layer thickness however the mechanism that enhances the adsorption of e2 at higher o content was not fully understood in this work the hypothesis proposed is that the adsorption rate rather than the mass transport rate was improved due to hydrogen bonding interactions between the carbon surface and the hydroxyl group present on e2 target studies of the surface chemistry influence on the adsorption of different micropollutants are needed to elucidate the potential of the surface chemistry modification 4 conclusions the systematic investigation of the material properties of pbsac was successfully carried out to improve the adsorption performance of a thin pbsac layer compared to the previous work tagliavini and schäfer 2018 the adsorption of estradiol can be achieved with a millimetric permeate side pbsac layer reaching the ambitious target of 1 ng l 1 the size of pbsac within the layer is the parameter that most influences the adsorption of hormones smaller pbsac in terms of diameters reduces the required layer thickness to 4 6 mm achieving still the target permeate concentration for a high feed of 100 ng l 1 pbsac activation does not affect the initial removal of e2 but it influences the maximum adsorption capacity achievable for mb thus the increasing microporous volume developed during the activation process affects mainly the equilibrium capacity but not the adsorption kinetics as was previously reported for pac by newcombe et al newcombe et al 2002 the investigation of the surface chemistry of pbsac resulted in relevant outcomes in that increasing the oxygen content on the adsorbent surface enhances the adsorption kinetic of estradiol due to hydrogen bonding formation the implication of this phenomenon is once again the possibility to reduce the required layer thickness in order to reach the target estradiol concentration in the permeate the combination of uf with a permeate side pbsac layer is a simple and efficient process to remove a micropollutant like the hormone estradiol from water beyond the satisfying performances this approach presents several advantages compared to other competing technologies i the process runs at lower pressure compared to reverse osmosis and nanofiltration ii it presents smaller footprint and lower carbon consumption compared to adsorption column and iii it avoids the formation of dangerous by products compared to advanced oxidation process which is considered the best options to remove estradiol and micropollutants from water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

17619,antibiotic resistance has become a global public health concern rendering common infections untreatable given the widespread occurrence increasing attention is being turned toward environmental pathways that potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance gene arg dissemination outside the clinical realm studies during the past decade have clearly proved the increased arg pollution trend along with gradient of anthropogenic interference mainly through marker arg detection by pcr based approaches however accurate source tracking has been always confounded by various factors in previous studies such as autochthonous arg level spatiotemporal variability and environmental resistome complexity as well as inherent method limitation the rapidly developed metagenomics profiles arg occurrence within the sample wide genomic context opening a new avenue for source tracking of environmental arg pollution coupling with machine learning classification it has been demonstrated the potential of metagenomic arg profiles in unambiguously assigning source contribution through identifying indicator arg and recovering arg host genomes metagenomics based analysis will further increase the resolution and accuracy of source tracking in this review challenges and progresses in source tracking studies on environmental arg pollution will be discussed with specific focus on recent metagenomics guide approaches we propose an integrative metagenomics based framework in which coordinated efforts on experimental design and metagenomic analysis will assist in realizing the ultimate goal of robust source tracking in environmental arg pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance gene environmental pollution source tracking pcr metagenomics machine learning classification 1 introduction since introduction of the first effective antibiotics i e sulfonamides and penicillin at the beginning of the twentieth century in the arms race between bacteria and antibiotics human medicine is beginning to lose ground and bacteria are beginning to fight back crofts et al 2017 the world bank has warned that by 2050 antibiotic resistance can cause an annual death burden of 10 million people and a global economic damage of 100 trillion usd world bank group 2017 yet identification and prioritization of effective control strategies for antibiotic resistance are in their infancy as the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args in various settings remain ill understood o neill 2016 currently there is growing concern that the environment potentially contribute to arg development outside the clinical realm berendonk et al 2015 pruden et al 2013 args have long been proposed as contaminants of emerging concern which is not commonly monitored in the environment but has the potential in causing adverse ecological and or human health effects pruden et al 2006 sanderson et al 2016 different from other chemical compounds behaviours of args in environment are often associated with their biological features berendonk et al 2015 e g genetic flow both vertically from parent to offspring and horizontally from siblings or peers which can be further complicated by ecological chemical physical and biogeographical factors like community dynamics selective pressure and spatiotemporal conditions in fact args as environmental pollutants has not been extensively realized until early 21st century rysz and alvarez 2004 pei et al 2006 and pruden et al 2006 firstly explored args as emerging contaminants in various environmental compartments in northern colorado in which they found that the concentrations of several tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes were significantly higher in environments directly impacted by urban agricultural activities than in the pristine and lesser impacted environments with more survey studies conducted more obvious positive relationships between anthropogenic activities and arg environmental contamination were identified chee sanford et al 2001 garner et al 2017 lapara et al 2011 pruden et al 2012 storteboom et al 2010a zhang et al 2016 that is arg amount increases within close proximity to human dominated ecosystems as either point e g wastewater treatment plants wwtps and pharmaceutical factories or diffuse e g livestock farms and impacted sediment water sources chee sanford et al 2009 2001 czekalski et al 2014 2012 jia et al 2014 lapara et al 2011 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 storteboom et al 2010a zhang et al 2016 therefore identifying possible sources and understanding their relationships with arg occurrence become vital in controlling arg dissemination in environment various methods including those culture dependent and independent have been applied to identify possible sources in environmental arg pollution due to the facts that high proportion of environmental bacteria escaping detection by culture based sampling rapp and giovannoni 2003 and uncertain genotype phenotype correlation opijnen and camilli 2012 culture dependent methods are hardly able to track arg contamination although these drawbacks can be overcome by culture independent methods like those pcr based they require dedicated primers and thus only detect or quantify certain targeted args from a sample recently the rapid developed shotgun high throughput sequencing hts offers a novel approach in gaining an unprecedented broad overview of diversity and abundance of genetic elements within a sample such informatic genetic profiling provides opportunities for robust statistical analysis to quantify source contribution to arg pollution level in an environment given the increasingly realized linkage between antibiotic resistance in environment and clinic there is an urgent call for a novel arg source tracking platform for efficient management of environmental arg pollution in this review we provide an overview of method development and highlight recent advances in quantitative source tracking of arg pollution in environment relevant features of args as an emerging pollutant and challenges in tracking their fate in an environment were discussed through evaluating performance of traditional mainly pcr based and novel hts based tools we underline the potential of developing an integrative quantitative framework to tracking sources of environmental arg pollution 2 antibiotics antibiotic resistance and args in the environment as an ancient essential defense line for microbial growth antibiotics are natural part of microbial ecosystem d costa et al 2011 the discovery of antibiotics in disease control sparked medical revolution dramatically facilitating both natural and synthetic antibiotic discovery and production it is estimated that around 100 000 metric tons of antibiotic produced annually boeckel et al 2015 in parallel with antibiotic production antibiotic resistance is an ancient protective mechanism in bacteria as a defence against their own antibiotics or a by product of their evolution in proximity to antibiotic producing neighbours d costa et al 2011 perry and wright 2013 they accomplish this by various functions such as prevention of access to target direct modification of antibiotics or changes in antibiotic targets blair et al 2014 these antibiotic resistance functions are mainly encoded by args which can be spontaneous mutations or acquired features blair et al 2014 over the years it has been shown by numerous studies that increased antibiotic consumption contributed to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance and args in various bacterial genera illustrating possible positive correlation among antibiotics antibiotic resistance and args austin et al 1999 bell et al 2014 such a relationship however might be disrupted by anthropogenic interference and their own associated chemical biological features especially under complex environmental settings chee sanford et al 2009 specifically spread of args as genetic elements can be mediated by genetic mechanisms like conjugation transduction and transformation soucy et al 2015 in addition inherent limitations in their detection approaches e g detection limit in antibiotic measurement and culture bias in antibiotic resistance assay might further confuse correlation analysis often contradictory statements on their relationship were reported chen et al 2014 hsu et al 2014 mcconnell et al 2018 xu et al 2016 on one hand positive correlations between antibiotic concentration and arg abundance was identified in the typical environments of antibiotic pollution like urban rivers chen et al 2013a niu et al 2016 xu et al 2016 and swine feedlots he et al 2014 on the other hand a diversity of args can be maintained in environments of limited antibiotic pollution even absence or trace amount under detection limit of antibiotics johnsen et al 2009 ling et al 2013 lu et al 2015 tamminen et al 2011 xu et al 2017 in one study on sediments of aquaculture farm without any antibiotic use history increased prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes was found over the four year surveillance period in the absence of any selective pressure tamminen et al 2011 these studies demonstrated that antibiotic antibiotic resistance and arg are not always directly linked as their relationship are constantly subject to complex conditions in the environment like the widespread co selective agents refer to more discussion on co selection in section 3 3 as args are the fundamental mechanisms of antibiotic resistance under antibiotic pressure public health oriented environmental pollution studies would benefit from devoting specific attention to args as the contaminants of interest pruden et al 2012 3 challenges of tracking args in the environment once args or arg carrying bacteria were released into environment they will deal with the autochthonous microbial communities through physiological and ecological interactions promoting the conditions for a magnified genetic exchange in addition fates of args will be subject to dynamic environmental conditions over a certain spatial and temporal scale e g river flow seasonal rainfall and human activities all these conditions processes will together cause a series of challenges in tracking arg in an environment fig 1 3 1 interference of autochthonous arg level antibiotic resistance is a natural phenomenon predating the broad antibiotic use in modern medicine thus a certain type level of args are native allen et al 2010 d costa et al 2011 to precisely identify args as pollutant from other sources it is necessary to be clear about interference from autochthonous genetic content in fact clinically important args have been identified in natural environments allen et al 2009 perron et al 2015 a highly diverse collection of genes encoding resistance to β lactam tetracycline and glycopeptide antibiotics have been detected in natural soil forsberg et al 2012 and even 30 000 year old permafrost sediments d costa et al 2011 in studies of polluted region across geographical gradient presence of an autochthonous tet gene pool in background environment was identified and the ecological pressures maintaining these pools may operate independently of impact of pollution sources like wwtps and lagoons koike et al 2007 storteboom et al 2010a 2010b to address the background effect storteboom et al 2010b compared arg levels in pristine upstream regions of the cache la poudre river located in the rocky mountains to downstream urban and agricultural sites therefore including regional control samples to distinguish autochthonous and allochthonous arg in an environment is essential for arg source tracking in addition pristine environments can be vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance as microbial communities and resistance profile of the unpolluted lake water can rapidly shift under the moderate exposure of high quality treated wastewater subirats et al 2019 source tracking of environmental args thus requires comprehensive survey to identify truly pristine environment environments with any historic record of anthropogenic interference should be excluded as natural environment since args might persist even the pollution source has been controlled stopped for years detail landscape information within proximity of the pristine environment is necessary to make sure there is no interference from anthropogenic activities 3 2 impact of spatial and temporal variability in most arg source tracking studies the samples were collected within a specific region during a certain period as representative samples covering pollution gradient to make sure that arg profiles in these samples reflect extent of anthropogenic interference in the environment a comprehensive survey of spatiotemporal variability is necessary for designing sampling campaign landscape features like population density sewage system pharmaceutical industries and animal farming have direct impact czekalski et al 2015 graham et al 2011 winkworth lawrence et al 2016 yang et al 2017 seasonality like climate effect and seasonal anthropogenic activities may exert additional forces in diluting or enriching args in certain area ahammad et al 2014 di cesare et al 2017 garner et al 2017 knapp et al 2012 mcconnell et al 2018 sabri et al 2018 for example throughout the duration of rainfall runoff events in an urban inland stream key differences were noted in the behaviour of args in which rainfall driven transport of args comprised a considerable fraction of overall downstream loadings di cesare et al 2017 garner et al 2017 specific attention thus should be paid on arg pattern between dry and wet season particularly in tropical area knapp et al 2012 and over or under estimate of anthropogenic impact on arg profile might happen without considering other important hydrogeological characteristics in one study on mississippi river although wastewater effluents contained very high levels of args empirical evidence showed that these inputs of args had little or no effect on the arg quantities a simple 1d model suggested that the primary reason for the surprising result was the large river flow rate compared to that of the wastewater discharges lapara et al 2015 besides the changes of environmental conditions the variability of biomass density along spatial and temporal scales might exert further impact on arg development when args are introduced to the receiving environments of high biomass density intensive microbial interaction may enhance horizontal gene transfer and subsequent arg dissemination which however is not the case in the environments of low biomass density 3 3 arg prevalence and persistence driven by co selective agents the significant role of other co selective pressures on arg development has also been recognized in recent years baker austin et al 2006 seiler and berendonk 2012 wales and davies 2015 especially repeated genetic co occurrences and empirical observations together indicate that metal exposure e g copper zinc and mercury can promote resistance to a wide range of antibiotics alonso et al 2001 calomiris et al 1984 di cesare et al 2016 li et al 2017 pal et al 2015 poole 2017 a few well characterized mechanisms have been proposed for metal driven co selection for antibiotic resistance baker austin et al 2006 mainly including i co resistance in which the genes encoding resistant phenotypes are physically linked ii cross resistance which can occur when antibiotics or metals can trigger the common physiological response iii co regulation which can coordinate transcriptional and translational responses of resistance to both antibiotics and metals in addition biocides like quaternary ammonium compound may show some similarities with antibiotics in their mechanisms of action which may also facilitate arg maintenance pal et al 2015 these documented associations suggest that other contaminants might thus represent a widespread and recalcitrant selection pressure contributing to the dissemination and maintenance of args in environment this phenomenon has been exemplified in source tracking of arg pollution in wwtps and farming polluted regions where proliferation of args were significantly correlated with non antibiotic agents while corresponding antibiotics almost undetected gao et al 2018 he et al 2014 lu et al 2015 xu et al 2017 in one study on historic colorado front range flood impact on riverine arg distribution quantitative monitoring suggested co selective pressures exerted by heavy metals in the reestablishment of arg profile following the flood which was further validated by co occurrence of metal and antibiotic resistance gene in network analysis garner et al 2016 therefore antibiotic selective pressure is not always required for the selection of those args carried by replicons that contain not only args but also any other selectable markers instead other co selective agents might be the driving force for arg prevalence and persistence in an environment 3 4 genetic diversity in environmental arg pollution the focus of source tracking of environmental arg pollution in the past has been on a few specific args prevalent in environment however in most cases these studies lost sight of the big picture a broad view of antibiotic resistance in a given environment is a collection of resistance genes which is termed resistome encompassing both intrinsic and acquired args encoding proteins with innate resistance through inherent microbial characteristics and obtained resistance through mutation or horizontal gene transfer as well as precursor and cryptic args encoding proteins with modest antibiotic resistance activity and proteins of unexpressed or under expressed antibiotic resistance d costa et al 2013 wright 2007 recent large scale metagenomic based studies on resistome across various habitats have demonstrated the dramatic depth and breadth of args outside of clinical settings crofts et al 2017 forsberg et al 2012 li et al 2015a nesme et al 2014 especially among environments subject to anthropogenic pressure urban wastewater system and livestock farm are often with a huge diversity of args frigon et al 2018 li et al 2015a vikesland et al 2017 yang et al 2014 compared with other environments relatively high biomass density in these environments substantially increases the chance of transfer and maintenance of such diverse args arg pollution is essentially interaction between ecologically connected resistome which can hardly be addressed by single gene based approaches despite of efforts by including multiple genes in source tracking the often inconsistency between observations based on different single marker genes even confused source identification graham et al 2011 he et al 2014 pruden et al 2012 lack of a comprehensive overview would prevent accurate source tracking of arg pollution in environment 4 marker gene based source tracking of environmental arg pollution since realizing potential threat of environmental arg pollution to public health in early 21st century methods to identify possible sources and to facilitate risk management have been continuously developed in the past decades because of lack of exhaustive tool to test resistance genes covering all antibiotic classes detection frequency of specific marker genes by traditional pcr approach were commonly utilized to indicate overall arg pollution within a region several marker args i e well studied args for environmental detection have been suggested and used frequently for field application table 1 such as tetracycline args tetw and tetm sulfonamide args sul1 and sul 2 β lactam args bla ctx m and bla tem etc berendonk et al 2015 luby et al 2016 recently clinical class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 has been proposed as proxy for anthropogenic arg pollution mainly due to its common linkage with args and rapid responses to diverse environmental pressures amos et al 2018 gillings et al 2015 however the throughput limitations associated with traditional qpcr largely prevent from comprehensive understanding of increasingly realized resistome in various habitats the recent development of qpcr arrays allows simultaneous quantification of hundreds of target genes with much improved quantitative capability it has been successfully applied in associating arg level in a peri urban area with anthropogenic activities in which more than 200 genes were detected with agriculture soil harbouring more diverse args compared to the pristine soils xiang et al 2018 considering arg diversity carried by integron instead of examining inti1 alone gatica et al 2016 characterized thousands of integron gene cassette associated reads using a high throughput amplicon sequencing pipeline and applied it to map the influence of wwtp effluent on receiving downstream environments among these efforts using single or multiple marker args one major problem is interference of background environment in identifying allochthonous signals ideally such marker genes should be abundant in anthropogenic sources and rare in native ecosystems however this might be not guaranteed as overlapped arg pools reported across various habitats forsberg et al 2012 li et al 2015a nesme et al 2014 and frequent presence of a few typical marker args in pristine environments storteboom et al 2010b tacão et al 2012 lack of rigorous pre survey of marker arg distribution profile over a certain spatiotemporal scale might therefore largely confuse source tracking results different strategies have been applied to address the problem high resolved geostatistical tools were developed to assess congruence of the surrounding landscape with the putative sources identified by marker args czekalski et al 2014 pruden et al 2012 storteboom et al 2010a another approach is using representative marker args of obvious abundance trend along pollution gradient to indicate potential pollution from specific sources chen et al 2013a he et al 2014 pruden et al 2006 storteboom et al 2010b these marker args were proved as representative genes for source tracking application by particular statistical methods like regression analysis and correspondence analysis for example among 18 args fexa sul1 and tetw were verified by regression analysis as the most reliable marker args to reflect anthropogenic sources of args in broiler feedlots he et al 2014 in addition to detection frequency tracking arg pollution can also be resolved by phylogenetic relationship between sequence variants of marker args derived from potential pollution sources and impacted environments in the context of microevolution specific arg variants can be developed under unique selective pressure of the environment thus providing useful genetic information for distinguishing environments with different anthropogenic interference the hypothesis was recently supported by comparing twelve resistomes within polluted and unpolluted rivers in which tacão et al 2012 has demonstrated that the nucleotide sequences of bla ctx m genes were clearly different between polluted and unpolluted lotic ecosystems moreover sequence variants of typical marker args tetw and suli unique to wwtps and livestock farms have been applied to identify corresponding sources for arg pollution in downstream adjacent environments hsu et al 2014 lapara et al 2011 in studies on monitoring groundwater underlying animal waste lagoons over a 3 year period comparative analysis of tetw sequences revealed that the impacted groundwater contained gene sequences almost identical to those in the lagoon but these genes were not found in background libraries chee sanford et al 2001 koike et al 2007 as potential of the phylogeny based methods confirmed by field studies they were further extended by coupling with additional statistical and geospatial analysis offering a highly valuable approach for the source tracking of args in mixed land use region by complementing sul tet detection frequency and tetw phylogenetic analysis with a geographical information system storteboom et al 2010a identified a gradient of various anthropogenic influences along the poudre and south platte rivers aiming to identify sources in an unambiguous way various statistical analyses have been applied to interpret observations based on marker genes besides basic abundance increase decrease and principle coordinate analysis between environments robust tools were also explored to explain arg variation by biotic abiotic phenomena one efficient tool proven in field application is general linear regression glr models czekalski et al 2015 fahrenfeld et al 2014 pruden et al 2012 winkworth lawrence et al 2016 in one study on applying glr model to track riverine args the quantities of sul1 and tetw genes were modelled as a function of capacities of upstream putative sources as the explanatory variables the correlation between upstream human activities and riverine args was resolved by evaluating exhaustive set of glr models comprising various combinations of the capacities of wwtps and agriculture farms with and without inverse distance weighting pruden et al 2012 to further quantify relative contribution of different sources researchers of the same study suggested to use tetw sul1 ratio as indicator since tetw and sul1 were featured by significant different abundance in different sources pruden et al 2012 more recently by accounting biotic spatial and chemical variables complicated predictive models were produced by amos et al 2015 which explained resistance level inti1 prevalence across river catchment mainly by number proximity size and type of surrounding wwtps the application of qpcr array also encourages suitable high throughput tools for processing hundreds of marker args simultaneously like randomforest prediction analysis xiang et al 2018 despite of these efforts precise magnitude of source contribution still remains as a big challenge in source tracking studies and the inherent biases of pcr methods such as amplification efficiency and primer specificity are inevitable in marker arg quantification there is an urgent call for efficient novel tools in accurate arg source tracking especially as growing concern about the role of polluted environments in the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance 5 emerging approaches and road forward the recently developed high throughput sequencing hts technique can capture sample wide genetic profiles quantitatively in a massive parallel way with the extraordinary potential to circumvent limitations in traditional pcr based methods table 2 by coupling with powerful bioinformatic tools in sequence processing and function annotation hts based metagenomics has been widely used for arg profiling in a variety of habitats and following environmental health monitoring brown and gast 2015 fitzpatrick and walsh 2016 li et al 2015a nesme et al 2014 pal et al 2016 pehrsson et al 2016 and several metagenomic studies have revealed that the arg composition profile significantly correlated with level of anthropogenic interference li et al 2015a nesme et al 2014 pal et al 2016 which corroborates capability of metagenomics in tracking regional arg pollution the recent successful applications of metagenomics in environmental pollution tracking together with continuously developed computational pipeline even pave the way for establishing a novel accurate source tracking framework fig 2 5 1 early efforts on metagenomics based source tracking among the early efforts exploring metagenomics in source tracking they mainly focused on correlating increase or decrease of general gene abundance with presence or absence of possible arg sources like wwtps and farms chen et al 2013b port et al 2012 rowe et al 2016 wallace et al 2018 for example potential human impact on puget sound region was detected by metagenomic analysis as the increased arg signal within proximity of wwtp effluent port et al 2012 which was reexamined and confirmed by considering variation over spatial and temporal scales wallace et al 2018 chu et al 2018 further coupled metagenomics with distance decay analyses to indicate wwtp origin of arg pollution in lake sediment in which arg composition and abundance dissimilarity in response to distance from wwtp effluent was evaluated by linear regression model recently through metagenomic approach researchers analysed the extent of resistome shift in environmental microbial communities under the exposure of various proportion of wwtp effluent and found that wwtp resistome can stabilize much more rapidly when receiving higher ratio of effluent regardless of difference in community composition and treatment process corno et al 2019 incorporating metagenomics into frameworks for monitoring arg level in environments also provides a novel approach for early risk management scientists have explored the potential of conceptually framing metagenomic data within an environmental health surveillance context port et al 2014 youngblood et al 2014 they used a metagenomic epidemiology based approach to develop a multivariate index to quantify antibiotic resistance potential of aquatic environments in which significant differences in the index levels were observed when comparing ecosystems more proximal versus distant to human impact port et al 2014 5 2 potential of machine learning classification for quantitative source tracking despite of the early exemplified utility of metagenomics for assessing and tracking arg pollution the large informatic data still remained underexplored and the question of quantitative framework in source tracking is still to be addressed to realize accurate source discrimination by metagenomics a novel statistically robust classification approach is required to decipher quantitative information embedded in abundance matrices of thousands of args by leveraging comprehensive data to acquire sample unique patterns machine learning classification approaches have been valuable tools in this big data era the potential of these approaches have been recently demonstrated by several successful applications of developed classification methods such as randomforest breiman 2001 soucetracker knights et al 2011 and feast shenhav et al 2019 in community based microbial source tracking brown et al 2017 dubinsky et al 2016 smith et al 2010 in particular the bayesian classification tool sourcetracker uses gibbs sampling to determine the probability that certain genes present in sink samples derived from specific source samples knights et al 2011 in this way sourcetracker provides an estimated proportion of the sequenced genetic profile at an environment i e sink that can be attributed to a specific pollution source i e source and allowance of unknown sources in sourcetracker results further improves accuracy in source assignments through extensive validation by global scale and region specific environmental samples our previous study demonstrated for the first time that the sourcetracker platform has significant implications in predicting putative sources of arg contamination in a probabilistic framework li et al 2018b especially across regional river and deep ocean sediments the sourcetracker estimated fecal source contribution to arg contamination decreased substantially from the mouth of the pearl river to the middle of the pearl river estuary and on to the south china sea congruent with interference gradient of urbanization and industrialization li et al 2018b in a recent application of sourcetracker in an urban stream street sweepings in storm strain outfall were identified as the biggest contributor of args in the urban stream during wet weather flows baral et al 2018 it is obvious that machine learning classification holds great potential for tracking arg pollution in a quantitative framework to complement the early studies in accurate arg source tracking of quantitative source contribution as well as to contextualize the method in light of current regulatory standard relevant methodological considerations in experimental design and model performance were further discussed here since machine learning classification use source library as training dataset to identify unique pattern between different sources careful experimental design to include representative high quality source samples is prerequisite of accurate source tracking detail survey including geographical and temporal variability should be conducted to clearly identify possible sources although lack of systematic evaluation in source tracking of arg pollution as validated by a double blinded study of fecal contamination geographical association among samples and minimum library size of ten sources have been recommended for sourcetracker to assign sources accurately staley et al 2018 one major interference in any source tracking analysis is background noises causing false positive signal and unnecessary concern by including pristine environment in source library autochthonous arg profile can be identified which will be excluded as pollution signal in downstream source tracking analysis based on training by source libraries performance of machine learning classification can be further checked and improved by in vitro experiment artificial samples generated by mixing sources at certain ratios can be used as input for classification algorithm in which agreement between expected and predicted source ratio indicates excellent classification performance however as demonstrated in our previous work li et al 2018b compared with sources with high contribution to a sink sample those sources with low contribution often associated with greater performance variation between multiple model runs which has also been extensively verified by source tracking studies on fecal pollution based on microbial community henry et al 2016 therefore relative standard deviation of sourcetracker predicted ratio of source contribution should be considered particularly for sources of low contribution to the sink sample and confident results should be based on multiple runs alteration of parameter settings like increasing rarefaction depth has been shown to enhance running consistency and distinguish false positive sources henry et al 2016 li et al 2018b however more rigorous evaluation is still needed on in which way individual and multiple parameters affecting sourcetracker performance including parameters of number of restarts and burn in of gibbs sampling rarefaction depth alpha and beta dirichlet hyperparameters systematic assessment of these technical consideration in near future would unlock full potential of machine learning classification in quantifying multiple source contribution to arg pollution with high specificity and sensitivity 5 3 other source tracking studies guided by metagenomics besides the big picture of overall arg profile metagenomics also offers a highly resolved view of each individual args in a sample wide genomic context thereby guiding indicator arg based analysis like pcr here indicator arg is defined as the arg retrieved from metagenomic dataset by statistical methods such as frequency and abundance analysis using indval function in r package labdsv to identify indicator args that characterize each source sample those equally prevalent in different sources or sporadically detected in the target source samples should be excluded therefore statistical methods should be carefully selected by taking both specificity and sensitivity of source detection into account compared with traditional marker gene indicator args selected from metagenomic data would be more efficient in discriminating different sources as a complementary approach these robust indicator args would assist in resolving challenges as aforementioned in both traditional and emerging metagenomic based source tracking in polluted environments with low source ratio where large variation often associated with results of sourcetracker pcr based on these indicator args may serve as a complementary method with sufficient sensitivity in addition as reported in community based source tracking sourcetracker may have trouble in differentiating sources of similar composition brown et al 2019 for example the highly shared arg profile pattern of two livestock farms might cause problem for sourcetracker in identifying the true source of arg pollution in downstream river since the algorithm will struggle in distinguishing source specific pattern this problem however might be addressed by statistically verified indicator arg with high specificity utilizing proper tools refer to the next section metagenomics can retrieve complete genes and their broad contextual information by assembling short reads into contiguous fragments i e contigs source specific arg variants with certain nucleotide alterations and phylogenetic relationship could be identified and tracked in polluted environments without relying on additional laborious pcr and sequencing metagenomics largely facilitates arg variant based source tracking process moreover the assembled contigs can provide essential contextual information within proximity of the encoded args mobile genetic elements and host associated features can be retrieved to further evaluate risk of the arg pollution in which pollution containing args with high mobile and pathogenic potential would be of particular concern in environmental risk assessment for example sources with more args carried on broad host range plasmids may have high potential to spread arg pollution rapidly across environments klümper et al 2015 li et al 2018a by further sequence processing high quality complete or draft host genomes of args present in a sample can be assembled from contigs or scaffolds which can be tracked as arg carrying population as has been shown in study on population diversity some bacterial populations are highly sensitive to disturbances within an environmental system thus remarkably dynamic even across short temporal and spatial scale meziti et al 2018 assessing the distribution pattern of these arg carrying populations could provide a highly resolved view as to where population originate and thus aid in source tracking 5 4 tools and databases for metagenomic arg analysis current broad application of metagenomics in various fields has been largely facilitated by continually decreasing sequencing costs and the growing sophistication in bioinformatic analysis quince et al 2017 in metagenomics guided arg analysis accurate annotation of arg like genes is essential for downstream analysis which can be conducted on short reads or assembled contigs reads produced from sequencing platforms like illumina can be directly aligned to reference databases using pairwise alignment tools such as blast altschul et al 1990 bowtie 2 langmead and salzberg 2012 or bwa li and durbin 2010 however false positive predictions might be inflated via directly short read annotation as reads derived from one specific args may spuriously align to other args due to local sequence homology careful parameter test in alignment will be helpful for minimizing the bias in which the parameters like similarity should not be too high i e 90 reducing the detection of gene homologous or too low i e 70 increasing background noise also genomic context was lost in fragmented sequences as advanced tools developed for sequence assembly e g metaspades nurk et al 2017 idba ud peng et al 2012 and megahit li et al 2015b long contiguous contigs can be recovered enabling deep genetic characterization through identifying complete specific genes and their positional information however poor assemblies especially in samples with insufficient sequencing depth would miss those args with low abundance which might be key to distinguish arg profiles between different samples compared with assembly based analysis read based approach provides a broader view of args with both high and low abundance in complex communities and read based analysis is generally less time consuming and computationally demanding which is critical for rapid detection and management of arg pollution given trade offs between read and assembly based approaches in source tracking of arg pollution we suggest utilizing read based annotation to catch overall pattern of arg across samples and further assembly based analysis to examine specific args the recent development of long read sequencing e g pacbio and nanopore can directly capture thousands of long genomic fragments in parallel clarke et al 2009 eid et al 2009 which we believe will provide an unprecedented insight into args and their genomic context both assembly and read based arg analysis largely rely on curated databases for arg annotation therefore development and maintenance of high quality public arg databases would be essential for achieving efficient source tracking in arg pollution current available public arg databases offer a few options e g card jia et al 2017 sarg yin et al 2018 ardb liu and pop 2009 and resfinder zankari et al 2012 generalized databases such as the actively maintained card jia et al 2017 and sarg yin et al 2018 cover broad spectrum of args in addition specialized arg databases provide comprehensive information for specific gene families such as those focusing on β lactamases e g laced thai et al 2009 lahey bush and jacoby 2010 and cbmar srivastava et al 2014 there are also tools like pointfinder zankari et al 2017 and card rgi jia et al 2017 developed for detection of chromosomal mutations conferring antibiotic resistance given increasingly novel genes discovered in various functional metagenomics studies databases of farme wallace et al 2016 and resfinderfg munk et al 2018 comprises a curated set of args functionally screened to confer resistance but not included in other databases recently hidden markov models hmms were used for arg assignment significantly improving capability in retrieving genes with essential functional domain however easily escaping detection by similarity for example curated protein families and associated hmm profiles in sargfam yin et al 2018 and resfam gibson et al 2015 circumvents the common strategy of assigning args using pairwise sequence alignment to reference databases in these databases number and diversity of the args included may vary a lot which will largely impact the annotation output this is especially obvious when analysing samples of environmental and clinical origins as the less comprehensive databases would be much less efficient in recovering complete arg profile from the complex not well studied environmental resistome than the well studied clinical resistome building database and developing algorithm of sufficient retrieval capability is therefore essential for examining environmental antibiotic resistance among the databases above we thus suggest researchers to choose the proper database based on sample type and study purpose comprehensive database containing all arg variants is especially useful when identifying args from complex environmental communities while specialized databases better serve for characterizing specific and novel args a comprehensive discussion on databases and tools for metagenomics based arg study has been recently published boolchandani et al 2019 overall along with rapidly advanced sequencing technology developing tools and databases for rapid and accurate arg identification would have far reaching value for robust metagenomics guided source tracking of arg pollution 6 conclusion taking traditional and emerging approaches into account we here propose an integrative metagenomics based framework for source tracking of arg pollution fig 2 metagenomics is the core part within the framework profiling individual arg in sample wide genomic context for different approaches briefly three key components will be integrated to establish the quantitative source tracking framework 1 careful survey covering a certain geographical and temporal scale is required for defining source and sink samples as well as generating artificial test samples the procedures including sample preparation sequencing and output quality check should be performed following consistent and standardized workflow 2 metagenomic datasets will be annotated using high quality reference database the abundance matrices of args across samples will be input for machine learning classification classification model will be trained by arg patterns in source samples evaluated by artificial datasets then applied for predicting source contribution ratio in polluted environmental samples multiple run and parameter adjustment are recommended for sink samples with low source ratio 3 further metagenomics analysis will retrieve indicator arg sequence variants of target args and genomes carrying args complementary analysis based on these specific genes genomes will be an aid for addressing challenges in tracking low ratio and overlapped source contribution knowledge from the whole source tracking framework will largely facilitate quantitative assessment of arg pollution and designing strategies in regional pollution control although more time consuming and demanding in terms of bioinformatic analysis compared to traditional methods continuously developed efficient algorithms and sequencing processing pipelines will facilitate future broad application of the quantitative source tracking framework coordinated efforts on establishing standard guidelines in both experimental design and bioinformatic analysis will further support a robust arg source tracking in the near future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17619,antibiotic resistance has become a global public health concern rendering common infections untreatable given the widespread occurrence increasing attention is being turned toward environmental pathways that potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance gene arg dissemination outside the clinical realm studies during the past decade have clearly proved the increased arg pollution trend along with gradient of anthropogenic interference mainly through marker arg detection by pcr based approaches however accurate source tracking has been always confounded by various factors in previous studies such as autochthonous arg level spatiotemporal variability and environmental resistome complexity as well as inherent method limitation the rapidly developed metagenomics profiles arg occurrence within the sample wide genomic context opening a new avenue for source tracking of environmental arg pollution coupling with machine learning classification it has been demonstrated the potential of metagenomic arg profiles in unambiguously assigning source contribution through identifying indicator arg and recovering arg host genomes metagenomics based analysis will further increase the resolution and accuracy of source tracking in this review challenges and progresses in source tracking studies on environmental arg pollution will be discussed with specific focus on recent metagenomics guide approaches we propose an integrative metagenomics based framework in which coordinated efforts on experimental design and metagenomic analysis will assist in realizing the ultimate goal of robust source tracking in environmental arg pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance gene environmental pollution source tracking pcr metagenomics machine learning classification 1 introduction since introduction of the first effective antibiotics i e sulfonamides and penicillin at the beginning of the twentieth century in the arms race between bacteria and antibiotics human medicine is beginning to lose ground and bacteria are beginning to fight back crofts et al 2017 the world bank has warned that by 2050 antibiotic resistance can cause an annual death burden of 10 million people and a global economic damage of 100 trillion usd world bank group 2017 yet identification and prioritization of effective control strategies for antibiotic resistance are in their infancy as the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args in various settings remain ill understood o neill 2016 currently there is growing concern that the environment potentially contribute to arg development outside the clinical realm berendonk et al 2015 pruden et al 2013 args have long been proposed as contaminants of emerging concern which is not commonly monitored in the environment but has the potential in causing adverse ecological and or human health effects pruden et al 2006 sanderson et al 2016 different from other chemical compounds behaviours of args in environment are often associated with their biological features berendonk et al 2015 e g genetic flow both vertically from parent to offspring and horizontally from siblings or peers which can be further complicated by ecological chemical physical and biogeographical factors like community dynamics selective pressure and spatiotemporal conditions in fact args as environmental pollutants has not been extensively realized until early 21st century rysz and alvarez 2004 pei et al 2006 and pruden et al 2006 firstly explored args as emerging contaminants in various environmental compartments in northern colorado in which they found that the concentrations of several tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes were significantly higher in environments directly impacted by urban agricultural activities than in the pristine and lesser impacted environments with more survey studies conducted more obvious positive relationships between anthropogenic activities and arg environmental contamination were identified chee sanford et al 2001 garner et al 2017 lapara et al 2011 pruden et al 2012 storteboom et al 2010a zhang et al 2016 that is arg amount increases within close proximity to human dominated ecosystems as either point e g wastewater treatment plants wwtps and pharmaceutical factories or diffuse e g livestock farms and impacted sediment water sources chee sanford et al 2009 2001 czekalski et al 2014 2012 jia et al 2014 lapara et al 2011 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 storteboom et al 2010a zhang et al 2016 therefore identifying possible sources and understanding their relationships with arg occurrence become vital in controlling arg dissemination in environment various methods including those culture dependent and independent have been applied to identify possible sources in environmental arg pollution due to the facts that high proportion of environmental bacteria escaping detection by culture based sampling rapp and giovannoni 2003 and uncertain genotype phenotype correlation opijnen and camilli 2012 culture dependent methods are hardly able to track arg contamination although these drawbacks can be overcome by culture independent methods like those pcr based they require dedicated primers and thus only detect or quantify certain targeted args from a sample recently the rapid developed shotgun high throughput sequencing hts offers a novel approach in gaining an unprecedented broad overview of diversity and abundance of genetic elements within a sample such informatic genetic profiling provides opportunities for robust statistical analysis to quantify source contribution to arg pollution level in an environment given the increasingly realized linkage between antibiotic resistance in environment and clinic there is an urgent call for a novel arg source tracking platform for efficient management of environmental arg pollution in this review we provide an overview of method development and highlight recent advances in quantitative source tracking of arg pollution in environment relevant features of args as an emerging pollutant and challenges in tracking their fate in an environment were discussed through evaluating performance of traditional mainly pcr based and novel hts based tools we underline the potential of developing an integrative quantitative framework to tracking sources of environmental arg pollution 2 antibiotics antibiotic resistance and args in the environment as an ancient essential defense line for microbial growth antibiotics are natural part of microbial ecosystem d costa et al 2011 the discovery of antibiotics in disease control sparked medical revolution dramatically facilitating both natural and synthetic antibiotic discovery and production it is estimated that around 100 000 metric tons of antibiotic produced annually boeckel et al 2015 in parallel with antibiotic production antibiotic resistance is an ancient protective mechanism in bacteria as a defence against their own antibiotics or a by product of their evolution in proximity to antibiotic producing neighbours d costa et al 2011 perry and wright 2013 they accomplish this by various functions such as prevention of access to target direct modification of antibiotics or changes in antibiotic targets blair et al 2014 these antibiotic resistance functions are mainly encoded by args which can be spontaneous mutations or acquired features blair et al 2014 over the years it has been shown by numerous studies that increased antibiotic consumption contributed to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance and args in various bacterial genera illustrating possible positive correlation among antibiotics antibiotic resistance and args austin et al 1999 bell et al 2014 such a relationship however might be disrupted by anthropogenic interference and their own associated chemical biological features especially under complex environmental settings chee sanford et al 2009 specifically spread of args as genetic elements can be mediated by genetic mechanisms like conjugation transduction and transformation soucy et al 2015 in addition inherent limitations in their detection approaches e g detection limit in antibiotic measurement and culture bias in antibiotic resistance assay might further confuse correlation analysis often contradictory statements on their relationship were reported chen et al 2014 hsu et al 2014 mcconnell et al 2018 xu et al 2016 on one hand positive correlations between antibiotic concentration and arg abundance was identified in the typical environments of antibiotic pollution like urban rivers chen et al 2013a niu et al 2016 xu et al 2016 and swine feedlots he et al 2014 on the other hand a diversity of args can be maintained in environments of limited antibiotic pollution even absence or trace amount under detection limit of antibiotics johnsen et al 2009 ling et al 2013 lu et al 2015 tamminen et al 2011 xu et al 2017 in one study on sediments of aquaculture farm without any antibiotic use history increased prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes was found over the four year surveillance period in the absence of any selective pressure tamminen et al 2011 these studies demonstrated that antibiotic antibiotic resistance and arg are not always directly linked as their relationship are constantly subject to complex conditions in the environment like the widespread co selective agents refer to more discussion on co selection in section 3 3 as args are the fundamental mechanisms of antibiotic resistance under antibiotic pressure public health oriented environmental pollution studies would benefit from devoting specific attention to args as the contaminants of interest pruden et al 2012 3 challenges of tracking args in the environment once args or arg carrying bacteria were released into environment they will deal with the autochthonous microbial communities through physiological and ecological interactions promoting the conditions for a magnified genetic exchange in addition fates of args will be subject to dynamic environmental conditions over a certain spatial and temporal scale e g river flow seasonal rainfall and human activities all these conditions processes will together cause a series of challenges in tracking arg in an environment fig 1 3 1 interference of autochthonous arg level antibiotic resistance is a natural phenomenon predating the broad antibiotic use in modern medicine thus a certain type level of args are native allen et al 2010 d costa et al 2011 to precisely identify args as pollutant from other sources it is necessary to be clear about interference from autochthonous genetic content in fact clinically important args have been identified in natural environments allen et al 2009 perron et al 2015 a highly diverse collection of genes encoding resistance to β lactam tetracycline and glycopeptide antibiotics have been detected in natural soil forsberg et al 2012 and even 30 000 year old permafrost sediments d costa et al 2011 in studies of polluted region across geographical gradient presence of an autochthonous tet gene pool in background environment was identified and the ecological pressures maintaining these pools may operate independently of impact of pollution sources like wwtps and lagoons koike et al 2007 storteboom et al 2010a 2010b to address the background effect storteboom et al 2010b compared arg levels in pristine upstream regions of the cache la poudre river located in the rocky mountains to downstream urban and agricultural sites therefore including regional control samples to distinguish autochthonous and allochthonous arg in an environment is essential for arg source tracking in addition pristine environments can be vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance as microbial communities and resistance profile of the unpolluted lake water can rapidly shift under the moderate exposure of high quality treated wastewater subirats et al 2019 source tracking of environmental args thus requires comprehensive survey to identify truly pristine environment environments with any historic record of anthropogenic interference should be excluded as natural environment since args might persist even the pollution source has been controlled stopped for years detail landscape information within proximity of the pristine environment is necessary to make sure there is no interference from anthropogenic activities 3 2 impact of spatial and temporal variability in most arg source tracking studies the samples were collected within a specific region during a certain period as representative samples covering pollution gradient to make sure that arg profiles in these samples reflect extent of anthropogenic interference in the environment a comprehensive survey of spatiotemporal variability is necessary for designing sampling campaign landscape features like population density sewage system pharmaceutical industries and animal farming have direct impact czekalski et al 2015 graham et al 2011 winkworth lawrence et al 2016 yang et al 2017 seasonality like climate effect and seasonal anthropogenic activities may exert additional forces in diluting or enriching args in certain area ahammad et al 2014 di cesare et al 2017 garner et al 2017 knapp et al 2012 mcconnell et al 2018 sabri et al 2018 for example throughout the duration of rainfall runoff events in an urban inland stream key differences were noted in the behaviour of args in which rainfall driven transport of args comprised a considerable fraction of overall downstream loadings di cesare et al 2017 garner et al 2017 specific attention thus should be paid on arg pattern between dry and wet season particularly in tropical area knapp et al 2012 and over or under estimate of anthropogenic impact on arg profile might happen without considering other important hydrogeological characteristics in one study on mississippi river although wastewater effluents contained very high levels of args empirical evidence showed that these inputs of args had little or no effect on the arg quantities a simple 1d model suggested that the primary reason for the surprising result was the large river flow rate compared to that of the wastewater discharges lapara et al 2015 besides the changes of environmental conditions the variability of biomass density along spatial and temporal scales might exert further impact on arg development when args are introduced to the receiving environments of high biomass density intensive microbial interaction may enhance horizontal gene transfer and subsequent arg dissemination which however is not the case in the environments of low biomass density 3 3 arg prevalence and persistence driven by co selective agents the significant role of other co selective pressures on arg development has also been recognized in recent years baker austin et al 2006 seiler and berendonk 2012 wales and davies 2015 especially repeated genetic co occurrences and empirical observations together indicate that metal exposure e g copper zinc and mercury can promote resistance to a wide range of antibiotics alonso et al 2001 calomiris et al 1984 di cesare et al 2016 li et al 2017 pal et al 2015 poole 2017 a few well characterized mechanisms have been proposed for metal driven co selection for antibiotic resistance baker austin et al 2006 mainly including i co resistance in which the genes encoding resistant phenotypes are physically linked ii cross resistance which can occur when antibiotics or metals can trigger the common physiological response iii co regulation which can coordinate transcriptional and translational responses of resistance to both antibiotics and metals in addition biocides like quaternary ammonium compound may show some similarities with antibiotics in their mechanisms of action which may also facilitate arg maintenance pal et al 2015 these documented associations suggest that other contaminants might thus represent a widespread and recalcitrant selection pressure contributing to the dissemination and maintenance of args in environment this phenomenon has been exemplified in source tracking of arg pollution in wwtps and farming polluted regions where proliferation of args were significantly correlated with non antibiotic agents while corresponding antibiotics almost undetected gao et al 2018 he et al 2014 lu et al 2015 xu et al 2017 in one study on historic colorado front range flood impact on riverine arg distribution quantitative monitoring suggested co selective pressures exerted by heavy metals in the reestablishment of arg profile following the flood which was further validated by co occurrence of metal and antibiotic resistance gene in network analysis garner et al 2016 therefore antibiotic selective pressure is not always required for the selection of those args carried by replicons that contain not only args but also any other selectable markers instead other co selective agents might be the driving force for arg prevalence and persistence in an environment 3 4 genetic diversity in environmental arg pollution the focus of source tracking of environmental arg pollution in the past has been on a few specific args prevalent in environment however in most cases these studies lost sight of the big picture a broad view of antibiotic resistance in a given environment is a collection of resistance genes which is termed resistome encompassing both intrinsic and acquired args encoding proteins with innate resistance through inherent microbial characteristics and obtained resistance through mutation or horizontal gene transfer as well as precursor and cryptic args encoding proteins with modest antibiotic resistance activity and proteins of unexpressed or under expressed antibiotic resistance d costa et al 2013 wright 2007 recent large scale metagenomic based studies on resistome across various habitats have demonstrated the dramatic depth and breadth of args outside of clinical settings crofts et al 2017 forsberg et al 2012 li et al 2015a nesme et al 2014 especially among environments subject to anthropogenic pressure urban wastewater system and livestock farm are often with a huge diversity of args frigon et al 2018 li et al 2015a vikesland et al 2017 yang et al 2014 compared with other environments relatively high biomass density in these environments substantially increases the chance of transfer and maintenance of such diverse args arg pollution is essentially interaction between ecologically connected resistome which can hardly be addressed by single gene based approaches despite of efforts by including multiple genes in source tracking the often inconsistency between observations based on different single marker genes even confused source identification graham et al 2011 he et al 2014 pruden et al 2012 lack of a comprehensive overview would prevent accurate source tracking of arg pollution in environment 4 marker gene based source tracking of environmental arg pollution since realizing potential threat of environmental arg pollution to public health in early 21st century methods to identify possible sources and to facilitate risk management have been continuously developed in the past decades because of lack of exhaustive tool to test resistance genes covering all antibiotic classes detection frequency of specific marker genes by traditional pcr approach were commonly utilized to indicate overall arg pollution within a region several marker args i e well studied args for environmental detection have been suggested and used frequently for field application table 1 such as tetracycline args tetw and tetm sulfonamide args sul1 and sul 2 β lactam args bla ctx m and bla tem etc berendonk et al 2015 luby et al 2016 recently clinical class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 has been proposed as proxy for anthropogenic arg pollution mainly due to its common linkage with args and rapid responses to diverse environmental pressures amos et al 2018 gillings et al 2015 however the throughput limitations associated with traditional qpcr largely prevent from comprehensive understanding of increasingly realized resistome in various habitats the recent development of qpcr arrays allows simultaneous quantification of hundreds of target genes with much improved quantitative capability it has been successfully applied in associating arg level in a peri urban area with anthropogenic activities in which more than 200 genes were detected with agriculture soil harbouring more diverse args compared to the pristine soils xiang et al 2018 considering arg diversity carried by integron instead of examining inti1 alone gatica et al 2016 characterized thousands of integron gene cassette associated reads using a high throughput amplicon sequencing pipeline and applied it to map the influence of wwtp effluent on receiving downstream environments among these efforts using single or multiple marker args one major problem is interference of background environment in identifying allochthonous signals ideally such marker genes should be abundant in anthropogenic sources and rare in native ecosystems however this might be not guaranteed as overlapped arg pools reported across various habitats forsberg et al 2012 li et al 2015a nesme et al 2014 and frequent presence of a few typical marker args in pristine environments storteboom et al 2010b tacão et al 2012 lack of rigorous pre survey of marker arg distribution profile over a certain spatiotemporal scale might therefore largely confuse source tracking results different strategies have been applied to address the problem high resolved geostatistical tools were developed to assess congruence of the surrounding landscape with the putative sources identified by marker args czekalski et al 2014 pruden et al 2012 storteboom et al 2010a another approach is using representative marker args of obvious abundance trend along pollution gradient to indicate potential pollution from specific sources chen et al 2013a he et al 2014 pruden et al 2006 storteboom et al 2010b these marker args were proved as representative genes for source tracking application by particular statistical methods like regression analysis and correspondence analysis for example among 18 args fexa sul1 and tetw were verified by regression analysis as the most reliable marker args to reflect anthropogenic sources of args in broiler feedlots he et al 2014 in addition to detection frequency tracking arg pollution can also be resolved by phylogenetic relationship between sequence variants of marker args derived from potential pollution sources and impacted environments in the context of microevolution specific arg variants can be developed under unique selective pressure of the environment thus providing useful genetic information for distinguishing environments with different anthropogenic interference the hypothesis was recently supported by comparing twelve resistomes within polluted and unpolluted rivers in which tacão et al 2012 has demonstrated that the nucleotide sequences of bla ctx m genes were clearly different between polluted and unpolluted lotic ecosystems moreover sequence variants of typical marker args tetw and suli unique to wwtps and livestock farms have been applied to identify corresponding sources for arg pollution in downstream adjacent environments hsu et al 2014 lapara et al 2011 in studies on monitoring groundwater underlying animal waste lagoons over a 3 year period comparative analysis of tetw sequences revealed that the impacted groundwater contained gene sequences almost identical to those in the lagoon but these genes were not found in background libraries chee sanford et al 2001 koike et al 2007 as potential of the phylogeny based methods confirmed by field studies they were further extended by coupling with additional statistical and geospatial analysis offering a highly valuable approach for the source tracking of args in mixed land use region by complementing sul tet detection frequency and tetw phylogenetic analysis with a geographical information system storteboom et al 2010a identified a gradient of various anthropogenic influences along the poudre and south platte rivers aiming to identify sources in an unambiguous way various statistical analyses have been applied to interpret observations based on marker genes besides basic abundance increase decrease and principle coordinate analysis between environments robust tools were also explored to explain arg variation by biotic abiotic phenomena one efficient tool proven in field application is general linear regression glr models czekalski et al 2015 fahrenfeld et al 2014 pruden et al 2012 winkworth lawrence et al 2016 in one study on applying glr model to track riverine args the quantities of sul1 and tetw genes were modelled as a function of capacities of upstream putative sources as the explanatory variables the correlation between upstream human activities and riverine args was resolved by evaluating exhaustive set of glr models comprising various combinations of the capacities of wwtps and agriculture farms with and without inverse distance weighting pruden et al 2012 to further quantify relative contribution of different sources researchers of the same study suggested to use tetw sul1 ratio as indicator since tetw and sul1 were featured by significant different abundance in different sources pruden et al 2012 more recently by accounting biotic spatial and chemical variables complicated predictive models were produced by amos et al 2015 which explained resistance level inti1 prevalence across river catchment mainly by number proximity size and type of surrounding wwtps the application of qpcr array also encourages suitable high throughput tools for processing hundreds of marker args simultaneously like randomforest prediction analysis xiang et al 2018 despite of these efforts precise magnitude of source contribution still remains as a big challenge in source tracking studies and the inherent biases of pcr methods such as amplification efficiency and primer specificity are inevitable in marker arg quantification there is an urgent call for efficient novel tools in accurate arg source tracking especially as growing concern about the role of polluted environments in the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance 5 emerging approaches and road forward the recently developed high throughput sequencing hts technique can capture sample wide genetic profiles quantitatively in a massive parallel way with the extraordinary potential to circumvent limitations in traditional pcr based methods table 2 by coupling with powerful bioinformatic tools in sequence processing and function annotation hts based metagenomics has been widely used for arg profiling in a variety of habitats and following environmental health monitoring brown and gast 2015 fitzpatrick and walsh 2016 li et al 2015a nesme et al 2014 pal et al 2016 pehrsson et al 2016 and several metagenomic studies have revealed that the arg composition profile significantly correlated with level of anthropogenic interference li et al 2015a nesme et al 2014 pal et al 2016 which corroborates capability of metagenomics in tracking regional arg pollution the recent successful applications of metagenomics in environmental pollution tracking together with continuously developed computational pipeline even pave the way for establishing a novel accurate source tracking framework fig 2 5 1 early efforts on metagenomics based source tracking among the early efforts exploring metagenomics in source tracking they mainly focused on correlating increase or decrease of general gene abundance with presence or absence of possible arg sources like wwtps and farms chen et al 2013b port et al 2012 rowe et al 2016 wallace et al 2018 for example potential human impact on puget sound region was detected by metagenomic analysis as the increased arg signal within proximity of wwtp effluent port et al 2012 which was reexamined and confirmed by considering variation over spatial and temporal scales wallace et al 2018 chu et al 2018 further coupled metagenomics with distance decay analyses to indicate wwtp origin of arg pollution in lake sediment in which arg composition and abundance dissimilarity in response to distance from wwtp effluent was evaluated by linear regression model recently through metagenomic approach researchers analysed the extent of resistome shift in environmental microbial communities under the exposure of various proportion of wwtp effluent and found that wwtp resistome can stabilize much more rapidly when receiving higher ratio of effluent regardless of difference in community composition and treatment process corno et al 2019 incorporating metagenomics into frameworks for monitoring arg level in environments also provides a novel approach for early risk management scientists have explored the potential of conceptually framing metagenomic data within an environmental health surveillance context port et al 2014 youngblood et al 2014 they used a metagenomic epidemiology based approach to develop a multivariate index to quantify antibiotic resistance potential of aquatic environments in which significant differences in the index levels were observed when comparing ecosystems more proximal versus distant to human impact port et al 2014 5 2 potential of machine learning classification for quantitative source tracking despite of the early exemplified utility of metagenomics for assessing and tracking arg pollution the large informatic data still remained underexplored and the question of quantitative framework in source tracking is still to be addressed to realize accurate source discrimination by metagenomics a novel statistically robust classification approach is required to decipher quantitative information embedded in abundance matrices of thousands of args by leveraging comprehensive data to acquire sample unique patterns machine learning classification approaches have been valuable tools in this big data era the potential of these approaches have been recently demonstrated by several successful applications of developed classification methods such as randomforest breiman 2001 soucetracker knights et al 2011 and feast shenhav et al 2019 in community based microbial source tracking brown et al 2017 dubinsky et al 2016 smith et al 2010 in particular the bayesian classification tool sourcetracker uses gibbs sampling to determine the probability that certain genes present in sink samples derived from specific source samples knights et al 2011 in this way sourcetracker provides an estimated proportion of the sequenced genetic profile at an environment i e sink that can be attributed to a specific pollution source i e source and allowance of unknown sources in sourcetracker results further improves accuracy in source assignments through extensive validation by global scale and region specific environmental samples our previous study demonstrated for the first time that the sourcetracker platform has significant implications in predicting putative sources of arg contamination in a probabilistic framework li et al 2018b especially across regional river and deep ocean sediments the sourcetracker estimated fecal source contribution to arg contamination decreased substantially from the mouth of the pearl river to the middle of the pearl river estuary and on to the south china sea congruent with interference gradient of urbanization and industrialization li et al 2018b in a recent application of sourcetracker in an urban stream street sweepings in storm strain outfall were identified as the biggest contributor of args in the urban stream during wet weather flows baral et al 2018 it is obvious that machine learning classification holds great potential for tracking arg pollution in a quantitative framework to complement the early studies in accurate arg source tracking of quantitative source contribution as well as to contextualize the method in light of current regulatory standard relevant methodological considerations in experimental design and model performance were further discussed here since machine learning classification use source library as training dataset to identify unique pattern between different sources careful experimental design to include representative high quality source samples is prerequisite of accurate source tracking detail survey including geographical and temporal variability should be conducted to clearly identify possible sources although lack of systematic evaluation in source tracking of arg pollution as validated by a double blinded study of fecal contamination geographical association among samples and minimum library size of ten sources have been recommended for sourcetracker to assign sources accurately staley et al 2018 one major interference in any source tracking analysis is background noises causing false positive signal and unnecessary concern by including pristine environment in source library autochthonous arg profile can be identified which will be excluded as pollution signal in downstream source tracking analysis based on training by source libraries performance of machine learning classification can be further checked and improved by in vitro experiment artificial samples generated by mixing sources at certain ratios can be used as input for classification algorithm in which agreement between expected and predicted source ratio indicates excellent classification performance however as demonstrated in our previous work li et al 2018b compared with sources with high contribution to a sink sample those sources with low contribution often associated with greater performance variation between multiple model runs which has also been extensively verified by source tracking studies on fecal pollution based on microbial community henry et al 2016 therefore relative standard deviation of sourcetracker predicted ratio of source contribution should be considered particularly for sources of low contribution to the sink sample and confident results should be based on multiple runs alteration of parameter settings like increasing rarefaction depth has been shown to enhance running consistency and distinguish false positive sources henry et al 2016 li et al 2018b however more rigorous evaluation is still needed on in which way individual and multiple parameters affecting sourcetracker performance including parameters of number of restarts and burn in of gibbs sampling rarefaction depth alpha and beta dirichlet hyperparameters systematic assessment of these technical consideration in near future would unlock full potential of machine learning classification in quantifying multiple source contribution to arg pollution with high specificity and sensitivity 5 3 other source tracking studies guided by metagenomics besides the big picture of overall arg profile metagenomics also offers a highly resolved view of each individual args in a sample wide genomic context thereby guiding indicator arg based analysis like pcr here indicator arg is defined as the arg retrieved from metagenomic dataset by statistical methods such as frequency and abundance analysis using indval function in r package labdsv to identify indicator args that characterize each source sample those equally prevalent in different sources or sporadically detected in the target source samples should be excluded therefore statistical methods should be carefully selected by taking both specificity and sensitivity of source detection into account compared with traditional marker gene indicator args selected from metagenomic data would be more efficient in discriminating different sources as a complementary approach these robust indicator args would assist in resolving challenges as aforementioned in both traditional and emerging metagenomic based source tracking in polluted environments with low source ratio where large variation often associated with results of sourcetracker pcr based on these indicator args may serve as a complementary method with sufficient sensitivity in addition as reported in community based source tracking sourcetracker may have trouble in differentiating sources of similar composition brown et al 2019 for example the highly shared arg profile pattern of two livestock farms might cause problem for sourcetracker in identifying the true source of arg pollution in downstream river since the algorithm will struggle in distinguishing source specific pattern this problem however might be addressed by statistically verified indicator arg with high specificity utilizing proper tools refer to the next section metagenomics can retrieve complete genes and their broad contextual information by assembling short reads into contiguous fragments i e contigs source specific arg variants with certain nucleotide alterations and phylogenetic relationship could be identified and tracked in polluted environments without relying on additional laborious pcr and sequencing metagenomics largely facilitates arg variant based source tracking process moreover the assembled contigs can provide essential contextual information within proximity of the encoded args mobile genetic elements and host associated features can be retrieved to further evaluate risk of the arg pollution in which pollution containing args with high mobile and pathogenic potential would be of particular concern in environmental risk assessment for example sources with more args carried on broad host range plasmids may have high potential to spread arg pollution rapidly across environments klümper et al 2015 li et al 2018a by further sequence processing high quality complete or draft host genomes of args present in a sample can be assembled from contigs or scaffolds which can be tracked as arg carrying population as has been shown in study on population diversity some bacterial populations are highly sensitive to disturbances within an environmental system thus remarkably dynamic even across short temporal and spatial scale meziti et al 2018 assessing the distribution pattern of these arg carrying populations could provide a highly resolved view as to where population originate and thus aid in source tracking 5 4 tools and databases for metagenomic arg analysis current broad application of metagenomics in various fields has been largely facilitated by continually decreasing sequencing costs and the growing sophistication in bioinformatic analysis quince et al 2017 in metagenomics guided arg analysis accurate annotation of arg like genes is essential for downstream analysis which can be conducted on short reads or assembled contigs reads produced from sequencing platforms like illumina can be directly aligned to reference databases using pairwise alignment tools such as blast altschul et al 1990 bowtie 2 langmead and salzberg 2012 or bwa li and durbin 2010 however false positive predictions might be inflated via directly short read annotation as reads derived from one specific args may spuriously align to other args due to local sequence homology careful parameter test in alignment will be helpful for minimizing the bias in which the parameters like similarity should not be too high i e 90 reducing the detection of gene homologous or too low i e 70 increasing background noise also genomic context was lost in fragmented sequences as advanced tools developed for sequence assembly e g metaspades nurk et al 2017 idba ud peng et al 2012 and megahit li et al 2015b long contiguous contigs can be recovered enabling deep genetic characterization through identifying complete specific genes and their positional information however poor assemblies especially in samples with insufficient sequencing depth would miss those args with low abundance which might be key to distinguish arg profiles between different samples compared with assembly based analysis read based approach provides a broader view of args with both high and low abundance in complex communities and read based analysis is generally less time consuming and computationally demanding which is critical for rapid detection and management of arg pollution given trade offs between read and assembly based approaches in source tracking of arg pollution we suggest utilizing read based annotation to catch overall pattern of arg across samples and further assembly based analysis to examine specific args the recent development of long read sequencing e g pacbio and nanopore can directly capture thousands of long genomic fragments in parallel clarke et al 2009 eid et al 2009 which we believe will provide an unprecedented insight into args and their genomic context both assembly and read based arg analysis largely rely on curated databases for arg annotation therefore development and maintenance of high quality public arg databases would be essential for achieving efficient source tracking in arg pollution current available public arg databases offer a few options e g card jia et al 2017 sarg yin et al 2018 ardb liu and pop 2009 and resfinder zankari et al 2012 generalized databases such as the actively maintained card jia et al 2017 and sarg yin et al 2018 cover broad spectrum of args in addition specialized arg databases provide comprehensive information for specific gene families such as those focusing on β lactamases e g laced thai et al 2009 lahey bush and jacoby 2010 and cbmar srivastava et al 2014 there are also tools like pointfinder zankari et al 2017 and card rgi jia et al 2017 developed for detection of chromosomal mutations conferring antibiotic resistance given increasingly novel genes discovered in various functional metagenomics studies databases of farme wallace et al 2016 and resfinderfg munk et al 2018 comprises a curated set of args functionally screened to confer resistance but not included in other databases recently hidden markov models hmms were used for arg assignment significantly improving capability in retrieving genes with essential functional domain however easily escaping detection by similarity for example curated protein families and associated hmm profiles in sargfam yin et al 2018 and resfam gibson et al 2015 circumvents the common strategy of assigning args using pairwise sequence alignment to reference databases in these databases number and diversity of the args included may vary a lot which will largely impact the annotation output this is especially obvious when analysing samples of environmental and clinical origins as the less comprehensive databases would be much less efficient in recovering complete arg profile from the complex not well studied environmental resistome than the well studied clinical resistome building database and developing algorithm of sufficient retrieval capability is therefore essential for examining environmental antibiotic resistance among the databases above we thus suggest researchers to choose the proper database based on sample type and study purpose comprehensive database containing all arg variants is especially useful when identifying args from complex environmental communities while specialized databases better serve for characterizing specific and novel args a comprehensive discussion on databases and tools for metagenomics based arg study has been recently published boolchandani et al 2019 overall along with rapidly advanced sequencing technology developing tools and databases for rapid and accurate arg identification would have far reaching value for robust metagenomics guided source tracking of arg pollution 6 conclusion taking traditional and emerging approaches into account we here propose an integrative metagenomics based framework for source tracking of arg pollution fig 2 metagenomics is the core part within the framework profiling individual arg in sample wide genomic context for different approaches briefly three key components will be integrated to establish the quantitative source tracking framework 1 careful survey covering a certain geographical and temporal scale is required for defining source and sink samples as well as generating artificial test samples the procedures including sample preparation sequencing and output quality check should be performed following consistent and standardized workflow 2 metagenomic datasets will be annotated using high quality reference database the abundance matrices of args across samples will be input for machine learning classification classification model will be trained by arg patterns in source samples evaluated by artificial datasets then applied for predicting source contribution ratio in polluted environmental samples multiple run and parameter adjustment are recommended for sink samples with low source ratio 3 further metagenomics analysis will retrieve indicator arg sequence variants of target args and genomes carrying args complementary analysis based on these specific genes genomes will be an aid for addressing challenges in tracking low ratio and overlapped source contribution knowledge from the whole source tracking framework will largely facilitate quantitative assessment of arg pollution and designing strategies in regional pollution control although more time consuming and demanding in terms of bioinformatic analysis compared to traditional methods continuously developed efficient algorithms and sequencing processing pipelines will facilitate future broad application of the quantitative source tracking framework coordinated efforts on establishing standard guidelines in both experimental design and bioinformatic analysis will further support a robust arg source tracking in the near future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
