23910,remotely sensed optical data are fundamental to be integrated into biogeochemical models since the key role of the optical properties on lower trophic dynamics in this paper it is shown how ocean optics satellite products are used to constrain the optical algorithm adopted in the operational biogeochemical model system medbfm that produces analyses forecasts and reanalyses for the mediterranean sea biogeochemistry within the european copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems two different data sets of diffuse attenuation coefficients k d for downward planar irradiance were used in medbfm to carry out three 15 year simulations the first simulation is based on climatological values retrieved with a global algorithm the second uses an updated interannually variable product from 4 different sensors obtained with a regional algorithm specifically developed for the mediterranean sea the third is forced by a climatological data set extracted from the updated algorithm differences between the two k d data sets are evaluated in terms of the adopted differing remote sensing algorithms and the impact of the two different optical forcings on the medbfm model output is quantified with a specific focus on chlorophyll also distinguishing the effect of using the interannually variable k d by the one related to the algorithm upgrade the differences between the interannually variable k d data set and the climatological one amount to 10 resulting in local variations of chlorophyll vertical profile concentration larger than 20 in some periods of the year noticeable effects are also observed on the along basin zonal range of deep chlorophyll maximum depths during the simulated period which increases with the use of the updated k d data set in the western mediterranean interannual variability of chlorophyll in summer grows up to 40 at 100 m matching up the updated model outputs with quality controlled biogeochemical argo floats data of fluorescence derived chlorophyll results in a small increase of the model skill keywords marine biogeochemical modelling satellite observations light extinction coefficient bgc argo observations deep chlorophyll maximum mediterranean sea 1 introduction in the recent decades satellite sensors measuring ocean colour have been providing an ample global data set with a constant temporal acquisition frequency despite the major shortcomings i e sensitivity to cloud coverage limitation to euphotic depth of satellite data their use to validate biogeochemical models is profitable and well documented as shown in gregg et al 2009 doney et al 2009 dutkiewicz et al 2015 2019 and salon et al 2019 the latter for a brief review of mediterranean sea applications combining numerical models and satellite products by means of data assimilation can additionally surpass limitations of separate techniques and has been therefore widely accepted within the scientific community the application of data assimilation schemes to satellite estimated chlorophyll might positively impact the simulation of biogeochemical processes by improving multi year state estimates simon et al 2015 ciavatta et al 2016 2019 fennel et al 2019 groom et al 2019 teruzzi et al 2018 2014b song et al 2016a b c mattern et al 2017 or by parameter optimization ciavatta et al 2011 remote sensing can additionally supply information for the optical component settings embedded in biogeochemical models lazzari et al 2012 methods of light implementation in ecological and biogeochemical models range from simple exponential functions of photosynthetically available radiation par as done in lazzari et al 2010 to fully coupled radiative transfer models as shown in dutkiewicz et al 2015 simplified versions of optical models may adopt apparent optical properties estimated from satellites therefore the choice of information retrieved from remote sensing becomes crucial for the correct representation of biogeochemical dynamics expressed in terms of productivity and spatial and temporal distribution of biogeochemical variables and may vary depending on the specific aspect to be addressed nonetheless efforts to use multi or hyperspectral models to integrate radiometry data with inherent and apparent optical properties thus embedding the radiative transfer theory into biogeochemistry have been recently implemented also in regional models e g skákala et al 2020 lazzari et al 2020 the scope of the present work is to evaluate how interannually variable apparent optical properties may affect the spatio temporal variability of the biogeochemical flux model bfm vichi et al 2007 lazzari et al 2012 2016 which is the core of the medbfm system operational within the european copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems the analysis is focused on the impact of changing diffuse attenuation coefficients of downwelling irradiance k d from single sensor climatological k d r e f to multi sensor interannually variable k d n e w values using data retrieved from cmems based on esa cci multi sensor reflectance and including a regional algorithm which should be more adequate for applications in the mediterranean sea the primary goals are firstly to estimate how the new k d data set changes the temporal and spatial variability of the biogeochemical dynamics specifically in terms of the chlorophyll field and the deep chlorophyll maximum dcm feature and secondly to evaluate the degree of improvement in the medbfm model skill focusing on the cmems chlorophyll product quality the former was tackled by separating the effect of the sensor upgrade by the one related to the introduction of the interannual variability the latter was carried out considering key chlorophyll metrics salon et al 2019 by comparing model profiles with a quality controlled biogeochemical argo bgc argo floats data set previously described in organelli et al 2017 and also adopted by terzić et al 2019 while a number of experimental analyses of the diffuse attenuation coefficient properties were already assessed morel and maritorena 2001 morel et al 2007a b organelli et al 2017 a study of such kind is to the authors knowledge a first attempt to evaluate the impact of different diffuse attenuation products on a multi year biogeochemical simulation section 2 describes the methods employed in the paper sections 3 and 4 show the results and discuss them in terms of different effects observed in temporal and spatial variability as well as for operational purposes concerning the quality of cmems chlorophyll products and section 5 draws the conclusions 2 methods an integrated approach based on a set of three numerical simulations carried out with the medbfm model 1999 2015 period and a recently delivered data set of biogeochemical argo bgc argo floats observations was used to assess how the new diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance may affect the 3 dimensional chlorophyll field hereafter also referred to as chl 2 1 biogeochemical model the biogeochemical model bfm vichi et al 2007 2013 is a biomass based numerical model that simulates biogeochemical fluxes of carbon phosphorus nitrogen silicon and oxygen characterizing the lower trophic level producers consumers and recyclers of the marine ecosystem the current version of bfm includes nine plankton functional types pfts phytoplankton pfts comprise diatoms flagellates picophytoplankton and dinoflagellates heterotrophic pfts contain carnivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton bacteria heterotrophic nanoflagellates and microzooplankton the non living compartment is separated into three groups labile semi labile and refractory organic matter bfm is coupled also to a carbonate system model cossarini et al 2015 canu et al 2015 which contains two prognostic state variables alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon and provides ph partial pressure of co 2 and air sea co 2 flux in the medbfm modelling system which produces analyses forecasts and reanalyses of the mediterranean sea biogeochemistry for cmems see salon et al 2019 for further details bfm is coupled with the ogstm transport model featuring ogstm bfm lazzari et al 2010 2012 2016 cossarini et al 2015 where ogstm is based on the opa 8 1 system foujols et al 2000 medbfm assimilates satellite estimated chlorophyll concentration data through a variational scheme teruzzi et al 2014b 2018 and is offline driven by daily physical forcings temperature salinity currents provided by the nemov3 6 model within the cmems regional consortium for the mediterranean sea clementi et al 2019 in bfm the phytoplankton photosynthesis and the chlorophyll to carbon ratio adaptation to different light regimes are regulated by par according to geider s formulation geider et al 1998 surface par values are obtained from the ecmwf atmospheric model output provided within the cmems regional consortium for the mediterranean sea where the shortwave radiation q s roughly between 0 2 and 4 μ m refers to radiation emitted by the sun then scattered absorbed or transmitted by the atmosphere and reflected or absorbed by the surface hogan and bozzo 2018 following ebenhoh et al 1997 par i e the visible portion of q s is then estimated with a multiplying factor of 0 5 the beer lambert light model used to evaluate the amount of irradiance available for photosynthesis at any vertical level of the medbfm model takes diffuse attenuation coefficients at 490 nm from satellites k d 490 1 p a r d z p a r d z 0 e k d x y z t z where 2 k d x y z t k d 490 x y t in the equations above p a r d z 0 is par at the surface level z 0 k d x y z t is equal to the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm from satellite whereas x y z and t are longitude latitude depth and time respectively hereafter k d 490 x y t is denoted as k d 490 in the present work we have adopted the medbfm model with the meshgrid based on 1 16 degree longitudinal scale factor and on 1 16 c o s ϕ latitudinal scale factor ϕ is the latitude the vertical meshgrid accounts for 72 vertical z levels 25 in the first 200 m depth 31 between 200 and 2000 m 16 below 2000 m model chlorophyll outputs have been produced at weekly frequency further details on the simulations carried out are in section 2 5 2 2 bgc argo float data set fluorescence derived chlorophyll data along the water column were utilized from the bgc argo float network see organelli et al 2016 and terzić et al 2019 a total of 31 floats were acquired for the period between 2012 and 2016 for the mediterranean basin with 1314 vertical profiles of chl concentration units of mg m 3 derived from fluorescence data acquisition had nominally a 10 m vertical resolution between 250 and 1000 m 1 m from 10 to 250 m increasing to 0 20 m from 10 m to the surface organelli et al 2016 each cast started from 1000 m parking depth at an adequate time in order to reach the surface around local noon with a time window of two hours bgc argo data employed in the present work have been used after quality control procedure which includes the non photochemical quenching correction xing et al 2018 bittig et al 2019 according to the mediterranean sea partition also used in cmems salon et al 2019 the profiles were available for 13 out of 16 sub basins fig 1 with the majority in the north western mediterranean nwm 332 followed by northern ionian ion3 170 and southern tyrrhenian tyr2 162 data were not present in the western ionian ion1 northern tyrrhenian tyr1 and the eastern levantine lev4 7 profiles were collected in the northern adriatic adr1 and only one in the western levantine lev1 2 3 k d data sets two k d 490 data sets are integrated in the medbfm model the first one hereafter k d r e f consists of a bi weekly climatology derived by the seawifs data sea viewing wide field of view sensor years 1998 2004 see lazzari et al 2012 the second data set hereafter k d n e w is interannually variable with a weekly frequency covers the period 1998 2015 and was computed for cmems merging seawifs modis aqua meris and viirs sensors for more details see volpe et al 2019 while k d r e f is derived by a global algorithm the k d n e w time series have been computed by a specifically developed and tuned algorithm for the mediterranean sea volpe et al 2017 therefore it is henceforth referred as cmems multi sensor regional product rep cmems note that we retrieved the rep cmems product in 2018 as v01 version based on esa cci reflectance volpe et al 2017 both data sets have been spatially interpolated from their original 1 km resolution on the model grid at 1 16 degree the k d r e f tuning procedure adopted in lazzari et al 2012 was based on a series of simulations to compare the model output with in situ values of dcm depth and magnitudes during summer in the levantine basin data from turley et al 2000 and moutin and raimbault 2002 resulting in a multiplication factor of 1 2 of the original k d 490 values the tuning procedure was included in the model simulations due to the uncertainty related to the use of mono spectral values of k d 490 while the dcm depth is the cumulative biogeochemical effect resulting from the interaction of the entire light spectrum represented by par with phytoplankton cullen 2015 mignot et al 2014 terzić et al 2019 similarly after a comparison with the tuned k d r e f values for the same season and sub basin k d n e w resulted in a multiplication factor of 1 3 the little difference between the tuning factors is due to the two algorithms adopted to produce the data sets k d r e f and k d n e w more specifically the algorithm used to compute diffuse attenuation coefficients of downwelling irradiance at 490 nm for the cmems multi sensors product is a fourth power polynomial expression of the remote sensing reflectance r r s λ ratio r r s 490 to r r s 555 denoted as ρ 490 555 and shown in eq 3 whereas the k d 490 calculation is written in eq 4 3 ρ 490 555 r r s 490 r r s 555 4 k d 490 k w 490 k b i o 490 where k w 0 0166 and k b i o 1 0 n 0 4 a n l o g 10 ρ 490 555 n are the diffuse attenuation coefficients of the pure water and biogenic components respectively note that the regional algorithm for the mediterranean sea as reported in volpe et al 2017 successively named medkd in volpe et al 2019 differs from the global see table 1 and therefore also the algorithm for the climatological data set k d r e f differs from the interannually variable one k d n e w the medbfm model needs k d 490 maps that fully cover the mediterranean basin surface daily data of k d n e w provided in the cmems catalogue 1 1 the product oceancolour med optics l3 rep observations 009 095 is continuously updated as reported in the cmems catalogue the most recent version is documented and validated in colella et al 2021 were used to calculate weekly averages at the model resolution of 1 16 the maps resulting from the temporal average and the spatial interpolation are still affected by cloud coverage gaps in the k d maps have been filled with a two step replacement strategy using monthly averaged maps and a climatology both built using the k d n e w time series firstly missing values in each weekly map are replaced with the monthly mean of the corresponding month then in case of still incomplete coverage gaps are replaced in a second step with the climatological values since the relatively high coverage of the weekly average 80 at basin scale and of the monthly average 95 the effects of spatial discontinuities potentially introduced by the replacement procedure can be considered marginal with respect to the spatial and temporal scales of the analysis carried out in the present work 2 4 k d data set differences climatological monthly maps of k d n e w data set are shown in fig 2 highest values 0 10 m 1 or higher are displayed during late autumn winter and early spring months especially in the western basin the peak is between march and april in the northwestern mediterranean which might coincide with the late winter early spring bloom period constantly higher values are noticed also for the northern aegean and alboran seas in this respect it is worth mentioning that from the modelling side these regions may present large uncertainties due to insufficiently accurate boundary conditions i e connecting the mediterranean sea with the black sea in the former and with the atlantic ocean in the latter case see for example salon et al 2019 and are thus less emphasized in following elaborations lowest values around 0 03 m 1 are observed in the ionian and levantine sub basins almost throughout the entire year with increasing values between december and february reaching 0 06 m 1 a clear east west gradient can be observed with values increasing westward climatological monthly maps of differences k d n e w k d r e f normalized with k d r e f values demonstrate how the spatial variability of satellite derived k d is affected by the use of the rep cmems data set fig 3 major discrepancies are seen for the western sub basins in the late winter early spring period where bi weekly climatological k d n e w values are up to 10 different compared to k d r e f rep cmems values are almost overall lower than seawifs in august and september whereas slight fluctuations of k d values are observed during autumn and early winter the last period characterized by a positive difference in the tyrrhenian sea because of the tuning procedure the sum of the differences over june july and august in the levantine basin is negligible 2 5 simulations protocol the medbfm model was run to simulate the mediterranean sea biogeochemistry for the period between 1999 and 2015 using the two different diffuse attenuation coefficient data sets k d 490 described in section 2 3 k d n e w and k d r e f we carried out three simulations table 2 namely s r e f forced with k d r e f s n e w forced with interannually variable k d n e w and s n e w c l i m forced with a climatology computed from k d n e w at the same bi weekly temporal frequency of k d r e f the s n e w c l i m simulation is critical to evaluate the impact of the new sensor and algorithm comparing the simulations forced by the rep cmems and the seawifs climatological data sets i e s n e w c l i m vs s r e f and the impact of introducing an interannually variable k d comparing the simulations forced by the variable and climatological data sets i e s n e w vs s n e w c l i m the reference simulation s r e f is available in the cmems catalogue 2 2 medsea reanalysis bio 006 008 and its quality has been already described in teruzzi et al 2014a here we focus on the anomalies among the three model configurations that differ only in terms of the diffuse attenuation coefficients adopted our analysis was constrained only to open ocean areas i e deeper than 200 m as already done in lazzari et al 2012 2016 leaving the interpretation of coastal regions for future computations with a more sophisticated light model 3 results in this section we assess how the interannually variable k d n e w produced through the regional algorithm from 4 different sensors and retrieved from the cmems catalogue affects 1 the chlorophyll horizontal and vertical distributions and its temporal variability and 2 the quality of the corresponding cmems product 3 1 impact of k d n e w on the chlorophyll field model outputs for both simulations are evaluated in terms of chl concentrations units of mg m 3 anomalies are calculated as the differences between s n e w c l i m and s r e f simulations normalized with values from s r e f and between s n e w and s n e w c l i m simulations normalized with values from s n e w c l i m chl values at surface 50 m and 100 m along the seasonal cycle are shown for march june september and december at surface fig 4 highest chl concentrations are observed in march for the western basin larger than 0 5 mg m 3 in the northwestern mediterranean while the rest of the basin displays oligotrophic values lower than 0 2 mg m 3 which holds true for all regions in june and september with values increasing again in december in the western mediterranean 0 3 mg m 3 the second column of fig 4 depicts the normalized difference between s n e w and s n e w c l i m showing that the impact of the interannual variability related to the rep cmems data set is spatially distributed with a certain patchiness with the main effect of increasing the chl concentration of few percents e g maximum of 7 in the western mediterranean and southern adriatic sea during march in march over the rest of the basin and in december we observe a slight decrease of surface chl while the effect in the warm semester seems quite negligible the change from seawifs to rep cmems data set right column of fig 4 shows comparable positive variations in the tyrrhenian sea in march and december in the latter also near the atlantic inflow and along the eastern coasts as expected the effect of upgrading the climatology is more uniformly distributed than what observed by introducing the interannual variability with a tendency to affect more the coastal areas see in march along the liguro provencal coast the tyrrhenian coast the south eastern levantine coast the latter more intense in december a close up on march in the western mediterranean fig 3 reveals an increase in k d values in the southern regions and a decrease north the resulting surface chl values in turn exhibit a more substantial decrease over the northern sector when comparing the simulation forced by the bi weekly rep cmems climatology with the one driven by seawifs and an increase due to the interannually variable k d meaning that in this area the change of sensor and algorithm is somehow counterbalanced by the increased variability related to the rep cmems data set at 50 m fig 5 the impacts of the k d upgrades are larger than what was observed at surface in particular in march in western sub basins but with positive differences also in june in the levantine and in december in the south western areas although with lower values of chlorophyll in march the change from seawifs to rep cmems data set shows a k d decrease increase in the north western south western areas and also in the western tyrrhenian and northern ionian seas fig 3 meaning an increase decrease of water transparency and therefore an increase decrease of chl concentration during the late winter bloom comparing s n e w c l i m with s r e f simulations right column of fig 5 on the other side the interannually variable k d tends to uniformly increase chl concentration over the whole western mediterranean further increasing chl concentration in the most productive area of the gulf of lions and partially reducing the effect over the south western areas the 50 m layer could be representative of typical dcm depths in western sub basins boldrin et al 2002 with enhanced values persisting until september consistently to the dcm dynamics in the west emerging between may and october lavigne et al 2015 in the period of dcm june and september in fig 5 we observe that increases decreases of k d n e w compared to k d r e f fig 3 roughly correspond to increase decrease of chl concentrations in the s n e w simulation showing a decoupling of the chlorophyll vertical structure between the surface and the dcm level the impacts observed in s n e w appear much lower during this period maximum chl concentrations at 100 m depth fig 6 are present in june and september in the central western and eastern basin 0 4 mg m 3 in agreement with the dcm depth late spring formation and stabilization throughout the summer and autumn months i e from april to november the variations in s n e w with respect to s n e w c l i m observed at 100 m in the north western sub basin in june are larger than 100 also due to decreasing values of chlorophyll at this depth possibly explained with a shift in dcm depth the effect of upgrading from seawifs to rep cmems is also more intense in september with a general increase in chl concentration mainly located in the western basin and adriatic and aegean marginal seas the coastal areas specifically in the tyrrhenian sea are affected in june the dcm is an ubiquitous feature of the chlorophyll vertical profile dynamics in oligotrophic environments and between late spring and autumn in the mediterranean sea siokou frangou et al 2010 displaying a zonal deepening from west to east as well as meridionally from north to south see lazzari et al 2012 lavigne et al 2015 oligotrophic environments such as the eastern mediterranean are characterized by deep dcm and nitracline which are concomitantly associated with lower chl concentrations and primary productivity estrada et al 1993 contrary to the areas with higher biological activity such as the ligurian sea which display shallower dcm with higher values of chl the calculation of the dcm depth is based on the following criteria see also lavigne et al 2015 salon et al 2019 depth of dcm should be deeper than 40 m and shallower than 200 m chl concentration at dcm depth should exceed 0 1 mg m 3 monthly mean and standard deviation values of dcm depth calculated for the s n e w respectively m n e w and σ m n e w as defined in appendix a where m is the dcm depth and σ m n e w is an indicator of the interannual variability are shown in fig 7 top as coloured squares per each sub basin x axis and month y axis the model confirms the presence of the dcm zonal gradient lavigne et al 2015 terzić et al 2019 as well as the disappearance of the feature during winter months due to an enhanced convective mixing which destabilizes the water column dcm depths in the levantine range from 80 to 100 m in spring to up to 120 m in summer months in agreement with lavigne et al 2015 with corresponding mean chl concentrations between 0 2 and 0 3 mg m 3 not shown consistently with results shown in christaki et al 2001 and dolan et al 2002 in western basins dcm depth ranges from 60 m in spring and autumn increasing to 70 80 m in summer in good accordance with lavigne et al 2015 with corresponding chl values higher than 0 4 mg m 3 during summer and decreasing in autumn to 0 3 mg m 3 mostly in nwm and tyrrhenian sea the interannual variability of dcm depth in s n e w fig 7b is between 4 and 8 m during the summer months increasing to around 12 m in may and reaching 14 m in the northern adriatic and northern ionian seas the difference in dcm depth mean and standard deviation between the three simulations is shown in the middle and bottom rows of fig 7 on average compared with s r e f the dcm depth increases around 5 m with the updated diffuse attenuation coefficient major differences in dcm depth arise in the ionian sub basins in may june and september october with an increase in the mean larger than 8 m and in the standard deviation of up to 6 m fig 7c a dcm depth increase larger than 6 m is also observable in the eastern levantine lev4 the general increase of the dcm depth during spring is specifically due to the effect of the interannually variable diffuse attenuation coefficient fig 7e while it rather tends to reduce dcm depth in october november with the result that the sensor upgrade plays an important role in increasing the dcm depth in this period more than the use of the interannually variable k d n e w the increase of the standard deviation in the dcm depth fig 7d quantifies the extension of the interannual variability simulated by s n e w demonstrating the role played by the updated interannually variable k d n e w as expected we can observe from fig 7f that the increase of variability is almost totally referred to the use of the interannually variable k d n e w rather than its bi weekly climatology the increased interannual variability of the dcm depth in s n e w in the four months characterized by the presence of dcm in all the mediterranean sea june to september see fig 7 is also illustrated in fig 8 which displays a widening of the range of values covered by the dcm mean depth along the zonal direction estimated about 80 i e from 7 9 to 14 4 m while the sensor upgrade has a minor contribute from 7 9 to 8 1 m considering the sub basin averages in the same period fig 9 confirms that with k d n e w the dcm depth deepens in most sub basins between 2 and 5 in comparison with the reference as also shown by the extension of the light red area in fig 8 the increase of the dcm mean depth in s n e w is coherent with an increase of the total chlorophyll biomass per area between 0 and 200 m in the period june september which results to be generally higher than the reference simulation up to 10 in the alboran sea such behaviour can be associated to the decreasing of the k d n e w between august and september fig 3 and the observed deepening of the dcm which may allow a larger availability of nutrients to increase the chlorophyll biomass however a cautionary behaviour must be maintained to directly relate these evidences since the dcm dynamics certainly involves optical properties related to light penetration but also nutrient availability may play a role lavigne et al 2015 cullen 2015 contrarily to physical processes of transport and mixing that are the same in the two simulations still fig 8 shows a slight but positive increase in the range of values of total chlorophyll biomass per area in the 0 200 m layer along the zonal direction in the period june to september around 3 i e from 3 9 mg m 2 to 4 01 mg m 2 with 2 related to the sensor upgrade demonstrating a limited but still extended interannual variability due to the introduction of k d n e w similar results are obtained considering the meridional mean of the 95th percentile of total chlorophyll biomass per area not shown the difference in chl values at dcm between s n e w and s r e f not shown does not convey a uniform pattern with a general decrease within the order of 10 and an increase of the same order especially in the eastern ones in august and september differences less than 0 03 mg m 3 most of the decrease is related to the introduction of the interannually variable k d similarly to the mean dcm depth the difference in the standard deviation of the mean chl value at dcm not shown is overall positive and almost totally due to the interannual variability introduced in s n e w revealing that the use of the updated k d n e w increases the range of chl values at dcm with larger differences during spring months at west and highest values in the adriatic sea further investigations to quantify the impact of the updated k d coefficient on spatial and temporal scales confirm that the main effect of the interannually variable k d in the upper 100 m is to extend both the spatial and interannual variability of the chlorophyll field between early spring and early autumn with a maximum effect about 40 in the western sub basins at 100 m during summer more details are reported in appendix a 3 2 impact of k d n e w on the model skill the quality controlled data set of bio optical variables from bgc argo floats described in section 2 2 has been used for the quality assessment of the chlorophyll variable a point by point match up was carried out between model chlorophyll output and bgc argo fluorescence derived chl data which was followed by a spatio temporal division monthly values for 16 sub basins the model skill in terms of chlorophyll product quality was evaluated with three statistical parameters bias root mean square error rmse and the pearson correlation coefficient ρ all reported in appendix b the quality statistical parameters for the three simulations are summarized in fig 10 fig 10a d and g show that negative biases are present in winter and autumn indicating that in the cold semester the model generally underestimates chl for all regions especially during spring in the northwestern mediterranean negative bias of almost 0 3 mg m 3 similarly fig 10b e h show that rmse ranges between 0 1 and 0 2 mg m 3 for eastern and from 0 2 to 0 3 mg m 3 for western sub basins with an anomalous value of 1 1 mg m 3 in april in the northwestern mediterranean due to values from bgc argo floats of up to 5 mg m 3 not shown correlation coefficients fig 10c f i basically span from 0 2 in winter over the levantine and 0 3 in autumn in the south western sub basins to 0 9 in the northern ionian sea between may and august the values of the quality parameters are generally in line with the outcomes from the cmems analysis and forecast product bolzon et al 2019 clear bias differences between s n e w and s r e f are mainly observed in spring decrements in the alboran sea southwestern mediterranean ionian and levantine areas show an improvement of the quality for the simulation implementing k d n e w while s n e w c l i m does not exhibits any appreciable variation a small reduction of the underestimation during autumn and winter especially in the western sub basins is also visible mainly due to the sensor upgrade differences in rmse and correlation among the different sub basins and months appear quite small in order to provide a synthesis of the impact of the new interannually variable data set and the one of the sensor upgrade only the metrics of fig 10 are averaged in the seasonal statistics of table 3 given the uneven distribution of the bgc argo floats among sub basins as shown in fig 1 western sub basins have an availability of data larger than eastern ones with nwm swm1 and swm2 surpassing 500 profiles constituting almost 40 of the total number of profiles in the mediterranean sea the spatial averages are representative of the actual data coverage and the eventual extrapolation to the whole mediterranean sea should be taken with caution then concerning the temporal distribution the total number of match ups in each season is roughly larger than 20000 the most important effect is the reduction of the bias in spring which in s n e w amounts to 0 023 mg m 3 and is reduced by 24 from s r e f and only by 4 with the sensor upgrade similarly in spring rmse is reduced by 6 roughly equally divided by the impact in sensor upgrade and the interannual variable k d and correlation increases by 9 66 of this increment is due to the use of the interannual variable k d the other seasons have lower differences with winter showing a small improvement and summer autumn a slightly decreased performance when the s n e w c l i m run shows a decrease in performance i e summer bias and rmse the interannual variability partly mitigates it supporting the importance of the time varying information 4 discussion the upgraded diffuse attenuation coefficient k d n e w resulted in a two fold different product firstly the interannual variability was introduced for the period 1999 2015 and secondly the product merged observations from 4 different satellite sensors thus implementing a modified remote sensing algorithm the previous data set k d r e f had a 7 year time span 1998 2004 to calculate a climatological year from seawifs observations moreover another advantage to the previous k d model input is the use of a product derived for regional purposes only i e the mediterranean sea which has been in the past already seen as a bio optically anomalous region and as such needs algorithms that vary from global ones see organelli et al 2017 and references therein in lazzari et al 2012 the light attenuation term was derived from seawifs data of seasonal climatological measurements for the period between 1998 and 2004 as already discussed in the aforementioned paper such an approach could introduce uncertainties due to several reasons firstly the use of k d for only one wavelength 490 nm is chosen in order to parametrize the diffuse attenuation for the whole visible range 400 700 nm namely k d p a r secondly by extrapolating the constant value calculated for the first optical depth on average between 15 and 35 m in the mediterranean see d ortenzio and ribera d alcalà 2009 along the entire water column the depth variability of k d is a priori neglected nevertheless constraining biogeochemical models to satellite derived products proved to help capturing the west east gradient of chlorophyll dynamics in terms of surface values and dcm depth in the mediterranean sea lazzari et al 2012 with successful implementations also for operational purposes lazzari et al 2010 salon et al 2019 our results show that the upgrade of the k d has a double impact increasing spatial and temporal variability of the chlorophyll dynamics in the ecosystem and modifying vertical distribution e g dcm depth and magnitude of chlorophyll while the first aspect is quite obvious the second is much more difficult to interpret since the non linear response of phytoplankton to the interaction between light nutrient resource availability and top down control along the water column and the effect of the vertical mixing regimes the impact of the upgraded model on spatial variability was initially discussed with k d maps fig 3 where major differences were spotted in western regions during late winter early spring months chl maps showed higher values in western sub basins at the surface during spring fig 4 at 50 m persisting also in summer months fig 5 followed by an enhancement in eastern parts at 100 m during summer and autumn the last two cases corresponding to the period and depth of dcm formation in the regions generally a non linear relationship between k d change and impact on surface chlorophyll is observed while a positive negative change of k d causes decrease increase of chlorophyll i e march in the south north western subbasins as a response of lower higher light availability in the surface layer the same k d change causes a negative change in chlorophyll in the whole area in april an increase of the top down control of phytoplankton biomass is the response after the increased production in a region of high vertical mixing not shown on the other hand another mechanism is possibly acting in the ultra oligotrophic eastern levantine areas the winter decrease of surface chlorophyll fig 4 first row and fig a 11 concurrent with the decrease of k d reflects a complex interaction along the water column dynamics where the higher light availability at 100 depth causes an increase of chlorophyll figs 6 and a 12 which in turn consumes nutrients and increases the nutrient depletion at surface in areas with weak vertical mixing regime this spatially heterogeneity most likely results from a complex interaction of k d with the entire water column where the vertical mixing regime in turn may cause non linear responses of the surface chl dynamics on k d a non linear response is widely observed also at depth as in fig 5 as a result of the model s non linearity i e photoacclimation vs photosynthesis processes in fact while an increase of light at depth causes a deepening of the dcm and vice versa fig 7 the response of the chlorophyll concentration at different depths to the change of k d is mediated by the water column dynamics for example the increase of k d in june fig 3 causes an increase of chlorophyll at 100 m in western sub basins consistently with the deepening of the dcm but a decrease of chlorophyll in the eastern sub basins as a response of the low nutrient flux reaching a layer above a deepened dcm in a weak vertical mixing regime thus different shapes of chlorophyll profiles are expected to emerge as the result of multiple factors acting with different intensity in the regions of the mediterranean sea barbieux et al 2019 however it must be noted that our results while satisfactorily describe the basin wide gradient of the chlorophyll field might lack a full realistic relationship between kd and chlorophyll actually the self shading process is not considered and specific mechanisms related to resource competition including light impacting chlorophyll and nutrient distribution tilman 1980 could be oversimplified results further demonstrated that with the use of k d n e w the dcm depth increased throughout the entire basin of about 2 5 on average fig 9 especially in late summer early autumn months fig 7c moreover an increase of the interannual variability of the dcm depth was observed both as increment of the related statistical indicator fig 7d and as increment of the mean latitudinal dcm depth values range fig 8 dcm depth thus proves to be a good indicator to follow a consistent response between light and the water column biogeochemical dynamics similar increment in magnitude and mean latitudinal values range were found considering the total chlorophyll biomass per area in the 0 200 m layer the enhancement of the interannual variability of the chlorophyll field at depth on a monthly scale was assessed showing the increase of the related statistical indicators at 100 m fig a 12 the average effect on dcm characteristics and in general over the mean chl vertical profile of the updated diffuse attenuation coefficient was also quantified examining the match up of our simulations with a recently acquired bgc argo floats data set our results showed that the cmems product quality indicators improve with the use of k d n e w especially in spring bias 24 rmse 6 correlation 9 and in autumn bias 10 when we observe a quality drop as in summer rmse the use of the interannually variable k d lessens the worsening effect related to the sensor algorithm change this result is particularly strategic for the specific production of reanalysis in the cmems framework see teruzzi et al 2014a in fact building a biogeochemical reanalysis simulation see fennel et al 2019 means to gather a large series of information and data that set the physical forcing the initial and the boundary conditions as well as observations for the validation assessment thus considering the complexity of a reanalysis production the upgrade of even a single element as k d which may bring a small relative improvement of quality is important 5 conclusions light propagation along the water column is one of the major drivers in shaping the vertical variability of the ecosystems our study was framed with two main targets on one side evaluating how a new data set of diffuse attenuation coefficient k d retrieved from satellite changes the temporal and spatial variability of the chlorophyll field and the deep chlorophyll maximum dcm features assessing both satellite sensor and algorithm upgrade and the inclusion of the interannual variability on the other side estimating how this new k d data set affects the medbfm model skill according to cmems guidelines by evaluating the surface chlorophyll product quality and comparing model profiles with a quality controlled bgc argo floats data set the use of the new k d data set results in an increase in chlorophyll variability both in terms of spatial patterns and temporal variability particularly in the deepest part of the euphotic layer consequently also the dcm dynamics show an increased variability furthermore the updated model configuration shows a slightly higher skill compared to the reference one in the match up analysis with the bgc argo data set the role played by the introduction of the interannual variability of k d in the model improved performance appears larger than the impact due to the sensor algorithm change both with a direct effect as in spring and autumn and also with an indirect effect mitigating the quality worsening related to the change in the satellite sensor as in summer the presented approach therefore constitutes a simple but efficient step in the path of possible model upgrades showing how remote sensing products can effectively improve phytoplankton dynamics in biogeochemical model reanalyses results shown in this paper are especially addressed to ecological modellers who lack a more complex representation of the optical properties our work showed the importance of including more realistic optical forcing in biogeochemical modelling though our model integrates the diffuse attenuation coefficient basically a remote sensing proxy a further step forward would be the use of multi or hyperspectral modelling which is designed to link radiometry data to inherent and apparent optical properties aiming to include the radiative transfer theory into biogeochemistry credit authorship contribution statement elena terzić methodology software validation

follow the same metrics as the top ones by taking the difference of the two simulations the two standard deviations computed for s n e w quantify the effect of k d n e w interannual variability on the spatially heterogeneous model outputs a positive difference in σ m n e w and σ s t d n e w in comparison with s r e f highlights the importance of using the interannual variable k d n e w in the reconstruction of the spatial heterogeneity from year to year surface mean chlorophyll variability fig a 11a higher in the western basin and peaked during winter and spring months is controlled by a strong seasonal cycle the corresponding chlorophyll interannual variability σ m n e w in fig a 11b follows similar seasonal and spatial patterns and amounts to up to 20 of the signal especially for spring months in the western basin the interannual variability of the sub basin spatial heterogeneity σ s t d n e w displays a similar pattern to σ m n e w resulting lower than 0 02 mg m 3 in most of the basin fig a 11c differences with s r e f are observed fig a 11c in western sub basins in late winter and april clearly positive in the northern part in march as already discussed for fig 4 variations in surface interannual variability show a similar pattern with a decrease increase in the north western south western sub basins during april may at 100 m the mean chl exhibits the presence of the dcm both in the western and in the eastern basin from spring to early autumn fig a 12a as already observed in fig 8 with highest values reached in the levantine sub basins in late spring and in swm1 and tyr1 chl shows a composite pattern of interannual variability fig a 12b and c with the highest interannual variability during transition periods i e spring and autumn amounting to up to 0 06 mg m 3 the comparison of s n e w and s r e f clearly shows augmented mean fig a 12d and interannual variability due to the introduction of the k d n e w with both indicators σ m n e w and σ s t d n e w presenting positive differences up to 40 specifically in summer in western sub basins and in april in levantine fig a 12e f at 50 m depth figures not shown a noticeable signal in mean chlorophyll patterns is observed during the period of dcm formation in western basin the latter also characterized by a larger spatial and temporal variability during spring when compared to eastern sub basins the updated k d coefficient does not severely affect s n e w except for a slight increase in interannual variability in nwm swm1 and swm2 in early spring the effect of k d n e w within the euphotic layer is to generally increase both the spatial and interannual variability of the post bloom chlorophyll field i e from april to october in the western basin and in april in the eastern basin with

23910,remotely sensed optical data are fundamental to be integrated into biogeochemical models since the key role of the optical properties on lower trophic dynamics in this paper it is shown how ocean optics satellite products are used to constrain the optical algorithm adopted in the operational biogeochemical model system medbfm that produces analyses forecasts and reanalyses for the mediterranean sea biogeochemistry within the european copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems two different data sets of diffuse attenuation coefficients k d for downward planar irradiance were used in medbfm to carry out three 15 year simulations the first simulation is based on climatological values retrieved with a global algorithm the second uses an updated interannually variable product from 4 different sensors obtained with a regional algorithm specifically developed for the mediterranean sea the third is forced by a climatological data set extracted from the updated algorithm differences between the two k d data sets are evaluated in terms of the adopted differing remote sensing algorithms and the impact of the two different optical forcings on the medbfm model output is quantified with a specific focus on chlorophyll also distinguishing the effect of using the interannually variable k d by the one related to the algorithm upgrade the differences between the interannually variable k d data set and the climatological one amount to 10 resulting in local variations of chlorophyll vertical profile concentration larger than 20 in some periods of the year noticeable effects are also observed on the along basin zonal range of deep chlorophyll maximum depths during the simulated period which increases with the use of the updated k d data set in the western mediterranean interannual variability of chlorophyll in summer grows up to 40 at 100 m matching up the updated model outputs with quality controlled biogeochemical argo floats data of fluorescence derived chlorophyll results in a small increase of the model skill keywords marine biogeochemical modelling satellite observations light extinction coefficient bgc argo observations deep chlorophyll maximum mediterranean sea 1 introduction in the recent decades satellite sensors measuring ocean colour have been providing an ample global data set with a constant temporal acquisition frequency despite the major shortcomings i e sensitivity to cloud coverage limitation to euphotic depth of satellite data their use to validate biogeochemical models is profitable and well documented as shown in gregg et al 2009 doney et al 2009 dutkiewicz et al 2015 2019 and salon et al 2019 the latter for a brief review of mediterranean sea applications combining numerical models and satellite products by means of data assimilation can additionally surpass limitations of separate techniques and has been therefore widely accepted within the scientific community the application of data assimilation schemes to satellite estimated chlorophyll might positively impact the simulation of biogeochemical processes by improving multi year state estimates simon et al 2015 ciavatta et al 2016 2019 fennel et al 2019 groom et al 2019 teruzzi et al 2018 2014b song et al 2016a b c mattern et al 2017 or by parameter optimization ciavatta et al 2011 remote sensing can additionally supply information for the optical component settings embedded in biogeochemical models lazzari et al 2012 methods of light implementation in ecological and biogeochemical models range from simple exponential functions of photosynthetically available radiation par as done in lazzari et al 2010 to fully coupled radiative transfer models as shown in dutkiewicz et al 2015 simplified versions of optical models may adopt apparent optical properties estimated from satellites therefore the choice of information retrieved from remote sensing becomes crucial for the correct representation of biogeochemical dynamics expressed in terms of productivity and spatial and temporal distribution of biogeochemical variables and may vary depending on the specific aspect to be addressed nonetheless efforts to use multi or hyperspectral models to integrate radiometry data with inherent and apparent optical properties thus embedding the radiative transfer theory into biogeochemistry have been recently implemented also in regional models e g skákala et al 2020 lazzari et al 2020 the scope of the present work is to evaluate how interannually variable apparent optical properties may affect the spatio temporal variability of the biogeochemical flux model bfm vichi et al 2007 lazzari et al 2012 2016 which is the core of the medbfm system operational within the european copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems the analysis is focused on the impact of changing diffuse attenuation coefficients of downwelling irradiance k d from single sensor climatological k d r e f to multi sensor interannually variable k d n e w values using data retrieved from cmems based on esa cci multi sensor reflectance and including a regional algorithm which should be more adequate for applications in the mediterranean sea the primary goals are firstly to estimate how the new k d data set changes the temporal and spatial variability of the biogeochemical dynamics specifically in terms of the chlorophyll field and the deep chlorophyll maximum dcm feature and secondly to evaluate the degree of improvement in the medbfm model skill focusing on the cmems chlorophyll product quality the former was tackled by separating the effect of the sensor upgrade by the one related to the introduction of the interannual variability the latter was carried out considering key chlorophyll metrics salon et al 2019 by comparing model profiles with a quality controlled biogeochemical argo bgc argo floats data set previously described in organelli et al 2017 and also adopted by terzić et al 2019 while a number of experimental analyses of the diffuse attenuation coefficient properties were already assessed morel and maritorena 2001 morel et al 2007a b organelli et al 2017 a study of such kind is to the authors knowledge a first attempt to evaluate the impact of different diffuse attenuation products on a multi year biogeochemical simulation section 2 describes the methods employed in the paper sections 3 and 4 show the results and discuss them in terms of different effects observed in temporal and spatial variability as well as for operational purposes concerning the quality of cmems chlorophyll products and section 5 draws the conclusions 2 methods an integrated approach based on a set of three numerical simulations carried out with the medbfm model 1999 2015 period and a recently delivered data set of biogeochemical argo bgc argo floats observations was used to assess how the new diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance may affect the 3 dimensional chlorophyll field hereafter also referred to as chl 2 1 biogeochemical model the biogeochemical model bfm vichi et al 2007 2013 is a biomass based numerical model that simulates biogeochemical fluxes of carbon phosphorus nitrogen silicon and oxygen characterizing the lower trophic level producers consumers and recyclers of the marine ecosystem the current version of bfm includes nine plankton functional types pfts phytoplankton pfts comprise diatoms flagellates picophytoplankton and dinoflagellates heterotrophic pfts contain carnivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton bacteria heterotrophic nanoflagellates and microzooplankton the non living compartment is separated into three groups labile semi labile and refractory organic matter bfm is coupled also to a carbonate system model cossarini et al 2015 canu et al 2015 which contains two prognostic state variables alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon and provides ph partial pressure of co 2 and air sea co 2 flux in the medbfm modelling system which produces analyses forecasts and reanalyses of the mediterranean sea biogeochemistry for cmems see salon et al 2019 for further details bfm is coupled with the ogstm transport model featuring ogstm bfm lazzari et al 2010 2012 2016 cossarini et al 2015 where ogstm is based on the opa 8 1 system foujols et al 2000 medbfm assimilates satellite estimated chlorophyll concentration data through a variational scheme teruzzi et al 2014b 2018 and is offline driven by daily physical forcings temperature salinity currents provided by the nemov3 6 model within the cmems regional consortium for the mediterranean sea clementi et al 2019 in bfm the phytoplankton photosynthesis and the chlorophyll to carbon ratio adaptation to different light regimes are regulated by par according to geider s formulation geider et al 1998 surface par values are obtained from the ecmwf atmospheric model output provided within the cmems regional consortium for the mediterranean sea where the shortwave radiation q s roughly between 0 2 and 4 μ m refers to radiation emitted by the sun then scattered absorbed or transmitted by the atmosphere and reflected or absorbed by the surface hogan and bozzo 2018 following ebenhoh et al 1997 par i e the visible portion of q s is then estimated with a multiplying factor of 0 5 the beer lambert light model used to evaluate the amount of irradiance available for photosynthesis at any vertical level of the medbfm model takes diffuse attenuation coefficients at 490 nm from satellites k d 490 1 p a r d z p a r d z 0 e k d x y z t z where 2 k d x y z t k d 490 x y t in the equations above p a r d z 0 is par at the surface level z 0 k d x y z t is equal to the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm from satellite whereas x y z and t are longitude latitude depth and time respectively hereafter k d 490 x y t is denoted as k d 490 in the present work we have adopted the medbfm model with the meshgrid based on 1 16 degree longitudinal scale factor and on 1 16 c o s ϕ latitudinal scale factor ϕ is the latitude the vertical meshgrid accounts for 72 vertical z levels 25 in the first 200 m depth 31 between 200 and 2000 m 16 below 2000 m model chlorophyll outputs have been produced at weekly frequency further details on the simulations carried out are in section 2 5 2 2 bgc argo float data set fluorescence derived chlorophyll data along the water column were utilized from the bgc argo float network see organelli et al 2016 and terzić et al 2019 a total of 31 floats were acquired for the period between 2012 and 2016 for the mediterranean basin with 1314 vertical profiles of chl concentration units of mg m 3 derived from fluorescence data acquisition had nominally a 10 m vertical resolution between 250 and 1000 m 1 m from 10 to 250 m increasing to 0 20 m from 10 m to the surface organelli et al 2016 each cast started from 1000 m parking depth at an adequate time in order to reach the surface around local noon with a time window of two hours bgc argo data employed in the present work have been used after quality control procedure which includes the non photochemical quenching correction xing et al 2018 bittig et al 2019 according to the mediterranean sea partition also used in cmems salon et al 2019 the profiles were available for 13 out of 16 sub basins fig 1 with the majority in the north western mediterranean nwm 332 followed by northern ionian ion3 170 and southern tyrrhenian tyr2 162 data were not present in the western ionian ion1 northern tyrrhenian tyr1 and the eastern levantine lev4 7 profiles were collected in the northern adriatic adr1 and only one in the western levantine lev1 2 3 k d data sets two k d 490 data sets are integrated in the medbfm model the first one hereafter k d r e f consists of a bi weekly climatology derived by the seawifs data sea viewing wide field of view sensor years 1998 2004 see lazzari et al 2012 the second data set hereafter k d n e w is interannually variable with a weekly frequency covers the period 1998 2015 and was computed for cmems merging seawifs modis aqua meris and viirs sensors for more details see volpe et al 2019 while k d r e f is derived by a global algorithm the k d n e w time series have been computed by a specifically developed and tuned algorithm for the mediterranean sea volpe et al 2017 therefore it is henceforth referred as cmems multi sensor regional product rep cmems note that we retrieved the rep cmems product in 2018 as v01 version based on esa cci reflectance volpe et al 2017 both data sets have been spatially interpolated from their original 1 km resolution on the model grid at 1 16 degree the k d r e f tuning procedure adopted in lazzari et al 2012 was based on a series of simulations to compare the model output with in situ values of dcm depth and magnitudes during summer in the levantine basin data from turley et al 2000 and moutin and raimbault 2002 resulting in a multiplication factor of 1 2 of the original k d 490 values the tuning procedure was included in the model simulations due to the uncertainty related to the use of mono spectral values of k d 490 while the dcm depth is the cumulative biogeochemical effect resulting from the interaction of the entire light spectrum represented by par with phytoplankton cullen 2015 mignot et al 2014 terzić et al 2019 similarly after a comparison with the tuned k d r e f values for the same season and sub basin k d n e w resulted in a multiplication factor of 1 3 the little difference between the tuning factors is due to the two algorithms adopted to produce the data sets k d r e f and k d n e w more specifically the algorithm used to compute diffuse attenuation coefficients of downwelling irradiance at 490 nm for the cmems multi sensors product is a fourth power polynomial expression of the remote sensing reflectance r r s λ ratio r r s 490 to r r s 555 denoted as ρ 490 555 and shown in eq 3 whereas the k d 490 calculation is written in eq 4 3 ρ 490 555 r r s 490 r r s 555 4 k d 490 k w 490 k b i o 490 where k w 0 0166 and k b i o 1 0 n 0 4 a n l o g 10 ρ 490 555 n are the diffuse attenuation coefficients of the pure water and biogenic components respectively note that the regional algorithm for the mediterranean sea as reported in volpe et al 2017 successively named medkd in volpe et al 2019 differs from the global see table 1 and therefore also the algorithm for the climatological data set k d r e f differs from the interannually variable one k d n e w the medbfm model needs k d 490 maps that fully cover the mediterranean basin surface daily data of k d n e w provided in the cmems catalogue 1 1 the product oceancolour med optics l3 rep observations 009 095 is continuously updated as reported in the cmems catalogue the most recent version is documented and validated in colella et al 2021 were used to calculate weekly averages at the model resolution of 1 16 the maps resulting from the temporal average and the spatial interpolation are still affected by cloud coverage gaps in the k d maps have been filled with a two step replacement strategy using monthly averaged maps and a climatology both built using the k d n e w time series firstly missing values in each weekly map are replaced with the monthly mean of the corresponding month then in case of still incomplete coverage gaps are replaced in a second step with the climatological values since the relatively high coverage of the weekly average 80 at basin scale and of the monthly average 95 the effects of spatial discontinuities potentially introduced by the replacement procedure can be considered marginal with respect to the spatial and temporal scales of the analysis carried out in the present work 2 4 k d data set differences climatological monthly maps of k d n e w data set are shown in fig 2 highest values 0 10 m 1 or higher are displayed during late autumn winter and early spring months especially in the western basin the peak is between march and april in the northwestern mediterranean which might coincide with the late winter early spring bloom period constantly higher values are noticed also for the northern aegean and alboran seas in this respect it is worth mentioning that from the modelling side these regions may present large uncertainties due to insufficiently accurate boundary conditions i e connecting the mediterranean sea with the black sea in the former and with the atlantic ocean in the latter case see for example salon et al 2019 and are thus less emphasized in following elaborations lowest values around 0 03 m 1 are observed in the ionian and levantine sub basins almost throughout the entire year with increasing values between december and february reaching 0 06 m 1 a clear east west gradient can be observed with values increasing westward climatological monthly maps of differences k d n e w k d r e f normalized with k d r e f values demonstrate how the spatial variability of satellite derived k d is affected by the use of the rep cmems data set fig 3 major discrepancies are seen for the western sub basins in the late winter early spring period where bi weekly climatological k d n e w values are up to 10 different compared to k d r e f rep cmems values are almost overall lower than seawifs in august and september whereas slight fluctuations of k d values are observed during autumn and early winter the last period characterized by a positive difference in the tyrrhenian sea because of the tuning procedure the sum of the differences over june july and august in the levantine basin is negligible 2 5 simulations protocol the medbfm model was run to simulate the mediterranean sea biogeochemistry for the period between 1999 and 2015 using the two different diffuse attenuation coefficient data sets k d 490 described in section 2 3 k d n e w and k d r e f we carried out three simulations table 2 namely s r e f forced with k d r e f s n e w forced with interannually variable k d n e w and s n e w c l i m forced with a climatology computed from k d n e w at the same bi weekly temporal frequency of k d r e f the s n e w c l i m simulation is critical to evaluate the impact of the new sensor and algorithm comparing the simulations forced by the rep cmems and the seawifs climatological data sets i e s n e w c l i m vs s r e f and the impact of introducing an interannually variable k d comparing the simulations forced by the variable and climatological data sets i e s n e w vs s n e w c l i m the reference simulation s r e f is available in the cmems catalogue 2 2 medsea reanalysis bio 006 008 and its quality has been already described in teruzzi et al 2014a here we focus on the anomalies among the three model configurations that differ only in terms of the diffuse attenuation coefficients adopted our analysis was constrained only to open ocean areas i e deeper than 200 m as already done in lazzari et al 2012 2016 leaving the interpretation of coastal regions for future computations with a more sophisticated light model 3 results in this section we assess how the interannually variable k d n e w produced through the regional algorithm from 4 different sensors and retrieved from the cmems catalogue affects 1 the chlorophyll horizontal and vertical distributions and its temporal variability and 2 the quality of the corresponding cmems product 3 1 impact of k d n e w on the chlorophyll field model outputs for both simulations are evaluated in terms of chl concentrations units of mg m 3 anomalies are calculated as the differences between s n e w c l i m and s r e f simulations normalized with values from s r e f and between s n e w and s n e w c l i m simulations normalized with values from s n e w c l i m chl values at surface 50 m and 100 m along the seasonal cycle are shown for march june september and december at surface fig 4 highest chl concentrations are observed in march for the western basin larger than 0 5 mg m 3 in the northwestern mediterranean while the rest of the basin displays oligotrophic values lower than 0 2 mg m 3 which holds true for all regions in june and september with values increasing again in december in the western mediterranean 0 3 mg m 3 the second column of fig 4 depicts the normalized difference between s n e w and s n e w c l i m showing that the impact of the interannual variability related to the rep cmems data set is spatially distributed with a certain patchiness with the main effect of increasing the chl concentration of few percents e g maximum of 7 in the western mediterranean and southern adriatic sea during march in march over the rest of the basin and in december we observe a slight decrease of surface chl while the effect in the warm semester seems quite negligible the change from seawifs to rep cmems data set right column of fig 4 shows comparable positive variations in the tyrrhenian sea in march and december in the latter also near the atlantic inflow and along the eastern coasts as expected the effect of upgrading the climatology is more uniformly distributed than what observed by introducing the interannual variability with a tendency to affect more the coastal areas see in march along the liguro provencal coast the tyrrhenian coast the south eastern levantine coast the latter more intense in december a close up on march in the western mediterranean fig 3 reveals an increase in k d values in the southern regions and a decrease north the resulting surface chl values in turn exhibit a more substantial decrease over the northern sector when comparing the simulation forced by the bi weekly rep cmems climatology with the one driven by seawifs and an increase due to the interannually variable k d meaning that in this area the change of sensor and algorithm is somehow counterbalanced by the increased variability related to the rep cmems data set at 50 m fig 5 the impacts of the k d upgrades are larger than what was observed at surface in particular in march in western sub basins but with positive differences also in june in the levantine and in december in the south western areas although with lower values of chlorophyll in march the change from seawifs to rep cmems data set shows a k d decrease increase in the north western south western areas and also in the western tyrrhenian and northern ionian seas fig 3 meaning an increase decrease of water transparency and therefore an increase decrease of chl concentration during the late winter bloom comparing s n e w c l i m with s r e f simulations right column of fig 5 on the other side the interannually variable k d tends to uniformly increase chl concentration over the whole western mediterranean further increasing chl concentration in the most productive area of the gulf of lions and partially reducing the effect over the south western areas the 50 m layer could be representative of typical dcm depths in western sub basins boldrin et al 2002 with enhanced values persisting until september consistently to the dcm dynamics in the west emerging between may and october lavigne et al 2015 in the period of dcm june and september in fig 5 we observe that increases decreases of k d n e w compared to k d r e f fig 3 roughly correspond to increase decrease of chl concentrations in the s n e w simulation showing a decoupling of the chlorophyll vertical structure between the surface and the dcm level the impacts observed in s n e w appear much lower during this period maximum chl concentrations at 100 m depth fig 6 are present in june and september in the central western and eastern basin 0 4 mg m 3 in agreement with the dcm depth late spring formation and stabilization throughout the summer and autumn months i e from april to november the variations in s n e w with respect to s n e w c l i m observed at 100 m in the north western sub basin in june are larger than 100 also due to decreasing values of chlorophyll at this depth possibly explained with a shift in dcm depth the effect of upgrading from seawifs to rep cmems is also more intense in september with a general increase in chl concentration mainly located in the western basin and adriatic and aegean marginal seas the coastal areas specifically in the tyrrhenian sea are affected in june the dcm is an ubiquitous feature of the chlorophyll vertical profile dynamics in oligotrophic environments and between late spring and autumn in the mediterranean sea siokou frangou et al 2010 displaying a zonal deepening from west to east as well as meridionally from north to south see lazzari et al 2012 lavigne et al 2015 oligotrophic environments such as the eastern mediterranean are characterized by deep dcm and nitracline which are concomitantly associated with lower chl concentrations and primary productivity estrada et al 1993 contrary to the areas with higher biological activity such as the ligurian sea which display shallower dcm with higher values of chl the calculation of the dcm depth is based on the following criteria see also lavigne et al 2015 salon et al 2019 depth of dcm should be deeper than 40 m and shallower than 200 m chl concentration at dcm depth should exceed 0 1 mg m 3 monthly mean and standard deviation values of dcm depth calculated for the s n e w respectively m n e w and σ m n e w as defined in appendix a where m is the dcm depth and σ m n e w is an indicator of the interannual variability are shown in fig 7 top as coloured squares per each sub basin x axis and month y axis the model confirms the presence of the dcm zonal gradient lavigne et al 2015 terzić et al 2019 as well as the disappearance of the feature during winter months due to an enhanced convective mixing which destabilizes the water column dcm depths in the levantine range from 80 to 100 m in spring to up to 120 m in summer months in agreement with lavigne et al 2015 with corresponding mean chl concentrations between 0 2 and 0 3 mg m 3 not shown consistently with results shown in christaki et al 2001 and dolan et al 2002 in western basins dcm depth ranges from 60 m in spring and autumn increasing to 70 80 m in summer in good accordance with lavigne et al 2015 with corresponding chl values higher than 0 4 mg m 3 during summer and decreasing in autumn to 0 3 mg m 3 mostly in nwm and tyrrhenian sea the interannual variability of dcm depth in s n e w fig 7b is between 4 and 8 m during the summer months increasing to around 12 m in may and reaching 14 m in the northern adriatic and northern ionian seas the difference in dcm depth mean and standard deviation between the three simulations is shown in the middle and bottom rows of fig 7 on average compared with s r e f the dcm depth increases around 5 m with the updated diffuse attenuation coefficient major differences in dcm depth arise in the ionian sub basins in may june and september october with an increase in the mean larger than 8 m and in the standard deviation of up to 6 m fig 7c a dcm depth increase larger than 6 m is also observable in the eastern levantine lev4 the general increase of the dcm depth during spring is specifically due to the effect of the interannually variable diffuse attenuation coefficient fig 7e while it rather tends to reduce dcm depth in october november with the result that the sensor upgrade plays an important role in increasing the dcm depth in this period more than the use of the interannually variable k d n e w the increase of the standard deviation in the dcm depth fig 7d quantifies the extension of the interannual variability simulated by s n e w demonstrating the role played by the updated interannually variable k d n e w as expected we can observe from fig 7f that the increase of variability is almost totally referred to the use of the interannually variable k d n e w rather than its bi weekly climatology the increased interannual variability of the dcm depth in s n e w in the four months characterized by the presence of dcm in all the mediterranean sea june to september see fig 7 is also illustrated in fig 8 which displays a widening of the range of values covered by the dcm mean depth along the zonal direction estimated about 80 i e from 7 9 to 14 4 m while the sensor upgrade has a minor contribute from 7 9 to 8 1 m considering the sub basin averages in the same period fig 9 confirms that with k d n e w the dcm depth deepens in most sub basins between 2 and 5 in comparison with the reference as also shown by the extension of the light red area in fig 8 the increase of the dcm mean depth in s n e w is coherent with an increase of the total chlorophyll biomass per area between 0 and 200 m in the period june september which results to be generally higher than the reference simulation up to 10 in the alboran sea such behaviour can be associated to the decreasing of the k d n e w between august and september fig 3 and the observed deepening of the dcm which may allow a larger availability of nutrients to increase the chlorophyll biomass however a cautionary behaviour must be maintained to directly relate these evidences since the dcm dynamics certainly involves optical properties related to light penetration but also nutrient availability may play a role lavigne et al 2015 cullen 2015 contrarily to physical processes of transport and mixing that are the same in the two simulations still fig 8 shows a slight but positive increase in the range of values of total chlorophyll biomass per area in the 0 200 m layer along the zonal direction in the period june to september around 3 i e from 3 9 mg m 2 to 4 01 mg m 2 with 2 related to the sensor upgrade demonstrating a limited but still extended interannual variability due to the introduction of k d n e w similar results are obtained considering the meridional mean of the 95th percentile of total chlorophyll biomass per area not shown the difference in chl values at dcm between s n e w and s r e f not shown does not convey a uniform pattern with a general decrease within the order of 10 and an increase of the same order especially in the eastern ones in august and september differences less than 0 03 mg m 3 most of the decrease is related to the introduction of the interannually variable k d similarly to the mean dcm depth the difference in the standard deviation of the mean chl value at dcm not shown is overall positive and almost totally due to the interannual variability introduced in s n e w revealing that the use of the updated k d n e w increases the range of chl values at dcm with larger differences during spring months at west and highest values in the adriatic sea further investigations to quantify the impact of the updated k d coefficient on spatial and temporal scales confirm that the main effect of the interannually variable k d in the upper 100 m is to extend both the spatial and interannual variability of the chlorophyll field between early spring and early autumn with a maximum effect about 40 in the western sub basins at 100 m during summer more details are reported in appendix a 3 2 impact of k d n e w on the model skill the quality controlled data set of bio optical variables from bgc argo floats described in section 2 2 has been used for the quality assessment of the chlorophyll variable a point by point match up was carried out between model chlorophyll output and bgc argo fluorescence derived chl data which was followed by a spatio temporal division monthly values for 16 sub basins the model skill in terms of chlorophyll product quality was evaluated with three statistical parameters bias root mean square error rmse and the pearson correlation coefficient ρ all reported in appendix b the quality statistical parameters for the three simulations are summarized in fig 10 fig 10a d and g show that negative biases are present in winter and autumn indicating that in the cold semester the model generally underestimates chl for all regions especially during spring in the northwestern mediterranean negative bias of almost 0 3 mg m 3 similarly fig 10b e h show that rmse ranges between 0 1 and 0 2 mg m 3 for eastern and from 0 2 to 0 3 mg m 3 for western sub basins with an anomalous value of 1 1 mg m 3 in april in the northwestern mediterranean due to values from bgc argo floats of up to 5 mg m 3 not shown correlation coefficients fig 10c f i basically span from 0 2 in winter over the levantine and 0 3 in autumn in the south western sub basins to 0 9 in the northern ionian sea between may and august the values of the quality parameters are generally in line with the outcomes from the cmems analysis and forecast product bolzon et al 2019 clear bias differences between s n e w and s r e f are mainly observed in spring decrements in the alboran sea southwestern mediterranean ionian and levantine areas show an improvement of the quality for the simulation implementing k d n e w while s n e w c l i m does not exhibits any appreciable variation a small reduction of the underestimation during autumn and winter especially in the western sub basins is also visible mainly due to the sensor upgrade differences in rmse and correlation among the different sub basins and months appear quite small in order to provide a synthesis of the impact of the new interannually variable data set and the one of the sensor upgrade only the metrics of fig 10 are averaged in the seasonal statistics of table 3 given the uneven distribution of the bgc argo floats among sub basins as shown in fig 1 western sub basins have an availability of data larger than eastern ones with nwm swm1 and swm2 surpassing 500 profiles constituting almost 40 of the total number of profiles in the mediterranean sea the spatial averages are representative of the actual data coverage and the eventual extrapolation to the whole mediterranean sea should be taken with caution then concerning the temporal distribution the total number of match ups in each season is roughly larger than 20000 the most important effect is the reduction of the bias in spring which in s n e w amounts to 0 023 mg m 3 and is reduced by 24 from s r e f and only by 4 with the sensor upgrade similarly in spring rmse is reduced by 6 roughly equally divided by the impact in sensor upgrade and the interannual variable k d and correlation increases by 9 66 of this increment is due to the use of the interannual variable k d the other seasons have lower differences with winter showing a small improvement and summer autumn a slightly decreased performance when the s n e w c l i m run shows a decrease in performance i e summer bias and rmse the interannual variability partly mitigates it supporting the importance of the time varying information 4 discussion the upgraded diffuse attenuation coefficient k d n e w resulted in a two fold different product firstly the interannual variability was introduced for the period 1999 2015 and secondly the product merged observations from 4 different satellite sensors thus implementing a modified remote sensing algorithm the previous data set k d r e f had a 7 year time span 1998 2004 to calculate a climatological year from seawifs observations moreover another advantage to the previous k d model input is the use of a product derived for regional purposes only i e the mediterranean sea which has been in the past already seen as a bio optically anomalous region and as such needs algorithms that vary from global ones see organelli et al 2017 and references therein in lazzari et al 2012 the light attenuation term was derived from seawifs data of seasonal climatological measurements for the period between 1998 and 2004 as already discussed in the aforementioned paper such an approach could introduce uncertainties due to several reasons firstly the use of k d for only one wavelength 490 nm is chosen in order to parametrize the diffuse attenuation for the whole visible range 400 700 nm namely k d p a r secondly by extrapolating the constant value calculated for the first optical depth on average between 15 and 35 m in the mediterranean see d ortenzio and ribera d alcalà 2009 along the entire water column the depth variability of k d is a priori neglected nevertheless constraining biogeochemical models to satellite derived products proved to help capturing the west east gradient of chlorophyll dynamics in terms of surface values and dcm depth in the mediterranean sea lazzari et al 2012 with successful implementations also for operational purposes lazzari et al 2010 salon et al 2019 our results show that the upgrade of the k d has a double impact increasing spatial and temporal variability of the chlorophyll dynamics in the ecosystem and modifying vertical distribution e g dcm depth and magnitude of chlorophyll while the first aspect is quite obvious the second is much more difficult to interpret since the non linear response of phytoplankton to the interaction between light nutrient resource availability and top down control along the water column and the effect of the vertical mixing regimes the impact of the upgraded model on spatial variability was initially discussed with k d maps fig 3 where major differences were spotted in western regions during late winter early spring months chl maps showed higher values in western sub basins at the surface during spring fig 4 at 50 m persisting also in summer months fig 5 followed by an enhancement in eastern parts at 100 m during summer and autumn the last two cases corresponding to the period and depth of dcm formation in the regions generally a non linear relationship between k d change and impact on surface chlorophyll is observed while a positive negative change of k d causes decrease increase of chlorophyll i e march in the south north western subbasins as a response of lower higher light availability in the surface layer the same k d change causes a negative change in chlorophyll in the whole area in april an increase of the top down control of phytoplankton biomass is the response after the increased production in a region of high vertical mixing not shown on the other hand another mechanism is possibly acting in the ultra oligotrophic eastern levantine areas the winter decrease of surface chlorophyll fig 4 first row and fig a 11 concurrent with the decrease of k d reflects a complex interaction along the water column dynamics where the higher light availability at 100 depth causes an increase of chlorophyll figs 6 and a 12 which in turn consumes nutrients and increases the nutrient depletion at surface in areas with weak vertical mixing regime this spatially heterogeneity most likely results from a complex interaction of k d with the entire water column where the vertical mixing regime in turn may cause non linear responses of the surface chl dynamics on k d a non linear response is widely observed also at depth as in fig 5 as a result of the model s non linearity i e photoacclimation vs photosynthesis processes in fact while an increase of light at depth causes a deepening of the dcm and vice versa fig 7 the response of the chlorophyll concentration at different depths to the change of k d is mediated by the water column dynamics for example the increase of k d in june fig 3 causes an increase of chlorophyll at 100 m in western sub basins consistently with the deepening of the dcm but a decrease of chlorophyll in the eastern sub basins as a response of the low nutrient flux reaching a layer above a deepened dcm in a weak vertical mixing regime thus different shapes of chlorophyll profiles are expected to emerge as the result of multiple factors acting with different intensity in the regions of the mediterranean sea barbieux et al 2019 however it must be noted that our results while satisfactorily describe the basin wide gradient of the chlorophyll field might lack a full realistic relationship between kd and chlorophyll actually the self shading process is not considered and specific mechanisms related to resource competition including light impacting chlorophyll and nutrient distribution tilman 1980 could be oversimplified results further demonstrated that with the use of k d n e w the dcm depth increased throughout the entire basin of about 2 5 on average fig 9 especially in late summer early autumn months fig 7c moreover an increase of the interannual variability of the dcm depth was observed both as increment of the related statistical indicator fig 7d and as increment of the mean latitudinal dcm depth values range fig 8 dcm depth thus proves to be a good indicator to follow a consistent response between light and the water column biogeochemical dynamics similar increment in magnitude and mean latitudinal values range were found considering the total chlorophyll biomass per area in the 0 200 m layer the enhancement of the interannual variability of the chlorophyll field at depth on a monthly scale was assessed showing the increase of the related statistical indicators at 100 m fig a 12 the average effect on dcm characteristics and in general over the mean chl vertical profile of the updated diffuse attenuation coefficient was also quantified examining the match up of our simulations with a recently acquired bgc argo floats data set our results showed that the cmems product quality indicators improve with the use of k d n e w especially in spring bias 24 rmse 6 correlation 9 and in autumn bias 10 when we observe a quality drop as in summer rmse the use of the interannually variable k d lessens the worsening effect related to the sensor algorithm change this result is particularly strategic for the specific production of reanalysis in the cmems framework see teruzzi et al 2014a in fact building a biogeochemical reanalysis simulation see fennel et al 2019 means to gather a large series of information and data that set the physical forcing the initial and the boundary conditions as well as observations for the validation assessment thus considering the complexity of a reanalysis production the upgrade of even a single element as k d which may bring a small relative improvement of quality is important 5 conclusions light propagation along the water column is one of the major drivers in shaping the vertical variability of the ecosystems our study was framed with two main targets on one side evaluating how a new data set of diffuse attenuation coefficient k d retrieved from satellite changes the temporal and spatial variability of the chlorophyll field and the deep chlorophyll maximum dcm features assessing both satellite sensor and algorithm upgrade and the inclusion of the interannual variability on the other side estimating how this new k d data set affects the medbfm model skill according to cmems guidelines by evaluating the surface chlorophyll product quality and comparing model profiles with a quality controlled bgc argo floats data set the use of the new k d data set results in an increase in chlorophyll variability both in terms of spatial patterns and temporal variability particularly in the deepest part of the euphotic layer consequently also the dcm dynamics show an increased variability furthermore the updated model configuration shows a slightly higher skill compared to the reference one in the match up analysis with the bgc argo data set the role played by the introduction of the interannual variability of k d in the model improved performance appears larger than the impact due to the sensor algorithm change both with a direct effect as in spring and autumn and also with an indirect effect mitigating the quality worsening related to the change in the satellite sensor as in summer the presented approach therefore constitutes a simple but efficient step in the path of possible model upgrades showing how remote sensing products can effectively improve phytoplankton dynamics in biogeochemical model reanalyses results shown in this paper are especially addressed to ecological modellers who lack a more complex representation of the optical properties our work showed the importance of including more realistic optical forcing in biogeochemical modelling though our model integrates the diffuse attenuation coefficient basically a remote sensing proxy a further step forward would be the use of multi or hyperspectral modelling which is designed to link radiometry data to inherent and apparent optical properties aiming to include the radiative transfer theory into biogeochemistry credit authorship contribution statement elena terzić methodology software validation

follow the same metrics as the top ones by taking the difference of the two simulations the two standard deviations computed for s n e w quantify the effect of k d n e w interannual variability on the spatially heterogeneous model outputs a positive difference in σ m n e w and σ s t d n e w in comparison with s r e f highlights the importance of using the interannual variable k d n e w in the reconstruction of the spatial heterogeneity from year to year surface mean chlorophyll variability fig a 11a higher in the western basin and peaked during winter and spring months is controlled by a strong seasonal cycle the corresponding chlorophyll interannual variability σ m n e w in fig a 11b follows similar seasonal and spatial patterns and amounts to up to 20 of the signal especially for spring months in the western basin the interannual variability of the sub basin spatial heterogeneity σ s t d n e w displays a similar pattern to σ m n e w resulting lower than 0 02 mg m 3 in most of the basin fig a 11c differences with s r e f are observed fig a 11c in western sub basins in late winter and april clearly positive in the northern part in march as already discussed for fig 4 variations in surface interannual variability show a similar pattern with a decrease increase in the north western south western sub basins during april may at 100 m the mean chl exhibits the presence of the dcm both in the western and in the eastern basin from spring to early autumn fig a 12a as already observed in fig 8 with highest values reached in the levantine sub basins in late spring and in swm1 and tyr1 chl shows a composite pattern of interannual variability fig a 12b and c with the highest interannual variability during transition periods i e spring and autumn amounting to up to 0 06 mg m 3 the comparison of s n e w and s r e f clearly shows augmented mean fig a 12d and interannual variability due to the introduction of the k d n e w with both indicators σ m n e w and σ s t d n e w presenting positive differences up to 40 specifically in summer in western sub basins and in april in levantine fig a 12e f at 50 m depth figures not shown a noticeable signal in mean chlorophyll patterns is observed during the period of dcm formation in western basin the latter also characterized by a larger spatial and temporal variability during spring when compared to eastern sub basins the updated k d coefficient does not severely affect s n e w except for a slight increase in interannual variability in nwm swm1 and swm2 in early spring the effect of k d n e w within the euphotic layer is to generally increase both the spatial and interannual variability of the post bloom chlorophyll field i e from april to october in the western basin and in april in the eastern basin with

23911,monitoring and predicting global ocean biogeochemistry and marine ecosystems is one of the biggest challenges for the coming decade in operational systems biogeochemical bgc models are forced or coupled with physical ocean models fields that are generally constrained by data assimilation of temperature salinity and sea level anomalies yet while physical data assimilation substantially improves simulated physical fields bgc models forced by such analyses are commonly degraded and more especially in equatorial regions here impacts of physical data assimilation on surface chlorophyll and nitrate concentrations are investigated in the tropical pacific based on three ocean reanalysis runs using the same physical bgc model configuration but differing in their level of physical data assimilation it is shown that in the mercator ocean operational system the assimilation of satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature in addition to temperature and salinity in situ profiles leads to spurious vertical velocities in the western equatorial pacific our analysis suggests that these unrealistic vertical velocities are explained by the use of an inaccurate mean dynamic topography for the assimilation of altimetry that modifies the pressure driven horizontal circulation in the upper ocean layer moreover the biases found in this key region modify the subtle dynamical and bgc balances in the whole tropical pacific and result in unrealistic trends of ocean heat content and nitrate concentration this study demonstrates that looking into details of the physics is indispensable to improve physical data assimilation systems and to ensure that they make the best use of observations this is also a key point to refine the strategy of the bgc models forcing and further improve ocean predictions keywords physical biogeochemical models mean dynamic topography data assimilation vertical velocity tropical pacific observing system 1 introduction in the tropical pacific ocean atmosphere interactions occurring at different spatial and temporal scales drive the strongest mode of interannual variability namely the el niño southern oscillation enso wang et al 2017 numerous studies have shown that biogeochemistry and marine ecosystems are significantly affected by the enso related oceanic conditions not only in the tropical pacific e g loukos et al 2000 radenac et al 2012 but also in remote regions e g feely et al 1995 martínez lópez and zavala hidalgo 2009 machado et al 2013 in turn phytoplankton concentration in the surface layer can also have significant effects on its physical environment by reducing the solar penetration into the ocean and thereby affect the temperature and air sea interaction and induce positive feedback onto enso by heating effects park et al 2018a zhang et al 2019 significant progress in the understanding of enso related mechanisms has resulted from intense efforts of observation and modeling over the last four decades guilyardi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 yet important biases in physical and biogeochemical bgc models remain and limit our understanding of ocean mechanisms occurring at local to global scales and over diurnal to multidecadal periods in this context physical ocean reanalyses are a powerful tool that combines information from model dynamics surface fluxes and observation data sets to provide a dynamically consistent ocean state in the four dimensions storto et al 2019 following the development of remote sensing and in situ observations together with progress in modeling and data assimilation techniques these relevant monitoring tools are now identified as a centerpiece of climate research e g mayer et al 2018 unlike non assimilative ocean models reanalyses benefit from multivariate ocean data assimilation and model bias mitigation methods serving as a constraint to reduce systematic biases and long term drifts resulting from errors in initialization air sea flux formulation and process parameterization compared to objective analyses only based on observations ocean reanalyses use model dynamics counteracting the lack of information in sparsely observed regions to monitor and predict ocean biogeochemistry and marine ecosystems physical ocean reanalyses are now coupled or used as forcing fields to bgc or ecological models fennel et al 2019 but counter intuitively physical data assimilation solutions do not systematically produce better bgc fields than non assimilative solutions ford et al 2018 in fact bgc fields are even commonly degraded when forced by physics with data assimilation ourmières et al 2009 while et al 2010 raghukumar et al 2015 park et al 2018b this problem is exacerbated around the equator in global models while et al 2010 park et al 2018b but has also been observed in regional models raghukumar et al 2015 in controlling the amount of nutrients and carbon available at the surface ocean vertical velocity is a key variable for physical bgc models and numerous studies have pointed out that spurious vertical velocity is a persistent problem in physical ocean reanalyses these important implications for bgc models are not restricted to a specific ocean model or data assimilation system waters et al 2017 ford et al 2018 and have thus pushed the physical oceanography community to further investigate vertical physics during data assimilation procedures unrealistic vertical velocity results from dynamical imbalance between the wind stress and the pressure gradient of data assimilation updates bell et al 2004 several studies have proposed specific techniques to prevent the data assimilation from degrading vertical velocity burgers et al 2002 demonstrated that including zonal velocity corrections in geostrophic balance with density corrections improves the representation of equatorial currents bell et al 2004 and more recently waters et al 2017 proposed to adapt the pressure density correction during the data assimilation step in order to maintain the dynamical balance between the wind stress and the pressure gradient along the equator a more pragmatic technique consisting in modulating the weight of data assimilation in sensitive regions gives positive results park et al 2018b but this choice is not fully satisfactory because it reduces the gain of data assimilation on horizontal physics while encouraging results have been obtained the vertical velocity issue associated with issues in other physical variables remains an important limitation of bgc models ford et al 2018 here we address this specific issue in the mercator ocean system focusing on the tropical pacific ocean based on an ensemble of three 7 yr physical ocean reanalysis fields hydrology and currents using the same ocean model configuration but varying the complexity and the level of data assimilation we will show that when the physical solution with both in situ and satellite observations is used as forcing fields for a bgc model unrealistic chlorophyll concentrations are observed in the equatorial band associated with higher vertical velocity section 4 in fact the assimilation of sea level anomaly requires a reference height the mean dynamic topography mdt defined as the difference between the mean sea surface and the earth s geoid uncertainty on the mdt can significantly impact on the quality of analyses and forecasts birol et al 2004 vidard et al 2009 yan et al 2015 hamon et al 2019 and significant improvements of ocean monitoring systems have been attributed to a more accurate mdt lellouche et al 2018 guiavarc h et al 2019 the western tropical pacific is known as a complex region the main focus here is to detail how the biases of the mdt here the term bias refers to error in the mdt modify the three dimensional oceanic circulation in the equatorial pacific and eventually the bgc fields this study will also determine how the changes in the mean properties can affect the representation of the long term variability that remains a challenge for ocean reanalyses storto et al 2019 even if significant improvement has been achieved for representing the steric sea level interannual variability in ocean reanalyses large discrepancies between estimates of interannual trends are still observed storto et al 2017 a recent study of gasparin et al 2018 showed that global patterns of changes of ocean heat and freshwater contents at interannual timescales are significantly improved with data assimilation but the amplitude is two times stronger than estimates from observations we will show here that biases in the mdt can produce unrealistic long term drift of the thermosteric component of the steric sea level through modifications of the ocean heat content in the following we begin with a description of the physical bgc model and the in situ and satellite observation products section 2 which have been used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the physics and biogeochemistry to the level of physical data assimilation section 3 then some simple dynamical arguments are given in section 4 to demonstrate how the use of a biased mdt for the assimilation of altimetry causes unrealistic upwelling by reducing the horizontal convergence in the western equatorial pacific finally the sensitivity of the evolution of the ocean heat content to the changes of the mean oceanic circulation is analyzed in light of previous results in section 5 conclusion and discussion are provided in section 6 2 ocean reanalysis simulations assimilation experiments and validation data sets 2 1 physical model and data assimilation procedures this work is mainly built upon a series of three 7 yr global ocean simulations which have been performed in the context of the global high resolution ocean monitoring and forecasting system operated in near real time by the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems since 19 october 2016 these runs have been originally presented in lellouche et al 2018 the system was run from october 2006 to october 2016 toward the real time regime assimilating the reprocessed observations along track altimetric sea level anomaly sla satellite sea surface temperature sst sea ice concentration in situ temperature and salinity vertical profiles t s profiles to quantify impacts of the main different components of the assimilation system two other twin numerical simulations that use the same ocean model configuration but that differ by their assimilation level of observation data sets have been performed over a similar period october 2006 december 2014 the model component is based on the version 3 1 of the nemo ocean model with a 1 12 orca grid type with a horizontal resolution of 9 km at the equator 7 km at mid latitudes and 2 km near the poles the water column is composed of 50 vertical levels including 22 levels within the upper 100 m with 1 m resolution at the surface and 450 m resolution at the bottom the forcing atmospheric fields are obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts integrated forecast system ecmwf ifs at 3 h resolution in order to reproduce the diurnal cycle this system has been initialized using temperature and salinity profiles from the en4 monthly gridded climatology good et al 2013 averaged for the period october december 2006 more details concerning parameterization of the terms included in the momentum heat and freshwater balances i e advection diffusion mixing or surface flux can be found in lellouche et al 2018 satellite altimetry sea surface temperature sst and sea ice concentration observations operationally produced by cmems http marine copernicus eu are assimilated in the system this consists of along track sea level anomaly data from the data unification and altimeter combination system duacs multi mission altimeter products and gridded ostia sst operational sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis which combines satellite sst data group for high resolution sea surface temperature project ghrsst with in situ observations donlon et al 2012 additionally satellite sea ice concentration from the eumetsat ocean and sea ice satellite application facility osi saf is assimilated subsurface vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from the cora 4 1 in situ database cabanes et al 2013 szekely et al 2016 are also assimilated this database includes vertical temperature and salinity profiles from argo floats moorings gliders expendable bathythermograph xbt transects sea mammals and conductivity temperature depth ctd casts from oceanographic cruises low quality profiles were excluded after several quality control tests were performed as described in lellouche et al 2018 observation data sets are assimilated using data assimilation techniques detailed in lellouche et al 2013 2018 and only the necessary elements to interpret results are presented here the main components of the data assimilation procedures are i a 3d var correction for the slowly evolving large scale error of the model in temperature and salinity based on in situ t s profiles over the last month and ii a reduced order kalman filter derived from a singular evolutive extended kalman filter seek brasseur and verron 2006 with a three dimensional multivariate modal decomposition of the background error and a 7 day assimilation cycle this multivariate procedure considers satellite and in situ observations and presumably corrects patterns at smaller spatial and temporal scales mesoscale activity than the 3d var correction in practice temperature and salinity observation are selected depending on the innovation value defined as the observation minus model forecast equivalent for the 3d var corrections innovations are considered on a 1 month window i e at a given 7 day cycle and the three previous cycles and depending on the horizontal distance of the order of 400 500 km in order to map large scale temperature and salinity corrections for the assimilation of the seek filter the analysis at a given point is based on surrounded innovations determined by spatial and temporal correlation scales ranging from 50 to 450 km in the zonal direction from 50 to 200 km in the meridional direction and from 3 to 15 days from the innovations and specified observation errors the seek filter generates a localized analysis increment which is a linear combination of short scale anomalies from a statistical ensemble representative of the forecast error covariances lellouche et al 2013 the 3d var correction and the seek increment are applied progressively using the incremental analysis update iau method another tendency term added in the model prognostic equations to avoid model shock every week due to the imbalance between the analysis increments and the model physics bloom et al 1996 benkiran and greiner 2008 to be comparable with the observed sla provided by altimetry the model sea surface height ssh is converted to sla relative to a reference mean ssh consequently the assimilation procedure of altimetry results in assimilating the altimetric sla but also the reference mean ssh in the context of numerical models having a spherical ellipsoid the mean ssh is equivalent to the mdt several approaches can be adopted an observation based mdt gathering in situ hydrologic and drifter data and gravimetric satellites observations would correct the mean state of the model however the use of such mdt can be damaging in some regions due to the inaccuracy of the mdt and or important model biases vidard et al 2009 additionally the spatial resolution of the estimates only based on observations around 100 km might not be consistent with that of the model here at 1 12 the mean ssh from the model may also be used directly as the mdt in that case model biases are not corrected and only temporal and spatial variability embedded in the altimetric anomalies is assimilated in practice long term reanalysis fields are preferred to get a more accurate estimate of the mean sea surface as done in the ecmwf system in which only t s observations are assimilated zuo et al 2019 they found large temperature and salinity biases in regions with strong mesoscale eddy activity i e along the western boundary currents and the antarctic circumpolar current some systems use a bias correction to correct for biases in the mdt during the assimilation e g lea et al 2008 in the present study the mdt results from a combination of model and observation based mdts following a complex iterative procedure using statistics from the previous reanalysis glorys2v3 the observed mdt cnes cls13 the 2014 version of the grace and goce data as well as the world ocean atlas woa 2013 climatology more details in hamon et al 2019 the error variance associated with the mdt estimate is an important information during the assimilation of altimetry to refine the sla error associated with each satellite lellouche et al 2018 as error associated with each data set used for the mdt computation is poorly known a boot strap estimation method based on the work of desroziers et al 2005 is used in addition an ensemble method is applied to overcome uncertainty in error statistics such as the correlation function or the error magnitude of each observation data set the final mdt error scale of about 150 km is computed by combining the dispersion of the ensemble members 36 members with the final error estimates produced by desroziers et al 2005 since the ensemble is relatively small an amplification of the dispersion is applied to obtain the level estimated by desroziers et al 2005 theoretically the sla error is optimal if there is no bias desroziers et al 2005 which is generally the case however the equatorial pacific is a notable exception where there is an inconsistency between sets of observations not shown likely related to gravimetric error and or non negligible contribution of deep steric height and ocean mass 2 2 biogeochemical model the bgc component of the physical bgc model is based on the model pisces pelagic interactions scheme for carbon and ecosystem studies distributed in the nemo framework based on coarsening algorithm the 1 12 physical daily fields have been degraded to the 1 4 horizontal resolution of the bgc model aumont et al 1998 to force the bgc model note that the coarsening algorithm allows to conserve the total volume contained in the 1 12 fields and maintain non divergence berthet et al 2019 pisces v2 aumont et al 2015 is a model of intermediate complexity with 24 prognostic variables which simulates the bgc cycles of oxygen carbon and major nutrients phosphate nitrate iron silicate controlling phytoplankton growth the model has been initialized with the world ocean atlas 2013 climatology for nitrate phosphate oxygen and silicate garcia et al 2013 and with the glodap v2 global ocean data analysis project version 2 climatology for the dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity lauvset et al 2016 2 3 ocean reanalysis simulations and assimilation experiments the set of ocean reanalysis fields including temperature salinity three dimensional velocity and sea surface height variables is composed of a free simulation with no data assimilation and two data assimilation simulations on one hand using only the 3d var large scale correction based on in situ temperature and salinity t s profiles on the other hand using the 3d var correction combined with a multivariate kalman filter considering t s profiles and satellite information of sea level anomaly and sea surface temperature note that including altimetry is fundamental for constraining the mesoscale structure to distinguish the three simulations by their level of data assimilation the first analogous simulation is called noassim without any data assimilation and the second one which only benefits from the large scale t s correction using in situ t s profiles is called assimts the simulation serving the operational system which uses a multivariate seek in addition to the large scale t s correction is referred as assimall table 1 as altimetry is assimilated by the mean of the seek filter only used in assimall differences between assimall and assimts are thus due to the assimilation of altimetry and the use of the seek filter note that the assimilation of sst is negligible for our study not shown the last two simulations performed over a period of several years with the same model configuration and reprocessed observation data sets are thus considered as ocean reanalysis fields as the ocean model state is stabilized i e it reaches the eddy kinetic energy maximum in about 6 months in the upper 1000 m with data assimilation or 12 months without assimilation lellouche et al 2018 the fields have been considered over the 2008 2014 period in this study it is noteworthy that the issue is not depended on the variability e g vertical velocity differences between simulations are not modulated by el niño in addition to the 7 yr simulations three 1 5 yr extra experiments have been performed to separate the effects on physical and biogeochemical fields due to the mdt for the assimilation of altimetry from those due to the use of the seek filter to reduce computational costs these experiments are based on an experimental system similar to that of the three reanalysis runs but at 1 4 horizontal resolution hamon et al 2019 over a 1 5 yr period the configuration is based on the version 3 1 of the nemo ocean model with 50 vertical levels forced by the ecmwf ifs atmospheric fields the model has been initialized in 1 january 2014 using temperature and salinity profiles from woa13 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 assimilation procedures have used the same datasets as in the assimall simulation i e satellite sst satellite sla in situ vertical profiles and sea ice concentration and the same techniques the 3d var correction and the seek filter the reference experiment called the control run uses the same mdt as assimall for the altimetry assimilation and only differs from assimall by the ogcm resolution and the time period this reference simulation will be compared with a second experiment noalti in which altimetric data are withheld t s profiles are used in the 3d var correction and the seek filter to assess the sensitivity of the physical bgc model to the mdt a third experiment named mdtpatch and only differing from the control run by the mdt will uses a patched mdt this will be further explained in section 4 4 these three physical fields have then been used to force the same bgc model than in section 2 2 the 1 yr segment from june 2014 to may 2015 has been periodically repeated over a 6 yr period to assess the long term evolution of biogeochemical variables it is noteworthy that even if this experimental procedure does not consider any interannual variability and might include discontinuity between repeated segments the intercomparison of these experiments allows to quantify the effects of physical data assimilation on bgc fields 2 4 validation datasets to evaluate the skills of the different bgc solutions surface chlorophyll chl estimates from the cmems globcolour product and nitrate fields from woa18 have been considered the cmems globcolour product 1997 present consists in a reprocessed merged chl product at 4 km spatial resolution based on measurements from several satellite observations seawifs 1997 2010 meris 2002 2012 modis aqua 2002 present viirs npp 2012 present and olci s3 a 2016 present this product is distributed by cmems garnesson et al 2019 the annual mean of nitrates from woa2018 consists of fields on a 1 1 spatial grid and are obtained from an optimal analysis based on high quality oceanographic in situ observations over the period 1955 2018 garcia et al 2018 in addition to bgc variables gridded monthly in situ temperature and salinity fields have been provided by the scripps argo climatology since 2004 for the global ocean roemmich and gilson 2009 gasparin et al 2015 and have been downloaded from the dedicated scripps argo website http www argo ucsd edu this 1 1 horizontal resolution product with 58 pressure levels from the surface to 2000 dbar is only based on t s measurements from argo floats in addition monthly averaged vertical profiles of currents estimated from acoustic doppler current profilers adcp on tao triton moorings have been downloaded from the global tropical mooring buoy array www pmel noaa gov gtmba adcp are available along the equator at 156 e 165 e 170 w 140 w 110 w over the whole period this single instrument datasets are preferred to gridded products including multiple data sources to ensure independence between comparison products 3 sensitivity of physics and biogeochemistry to physical data assimilation as mentioned in the introduction the present work has been firstly motivated by a persistent issue in most ocean reanalyses highlighted by over productive bgc models in the equatorial band likely due to spurious vertical velocity by comparing with observations the aim here is to evaluate the model solutions by investigating bgc and physical environments through the surface chl the nitrate concentration and vertical profiles of temperature and horizontal velocity 3 1 chlorophyll and nitrates fig 1 shows surface chl and vertical sections of nitrates no 3 along the equator with contours indicating model estimates and color shading is used for the discrepancy from the observation based product globcolour and woa2018 the surface chl shows an over productive eastern pacific in the three simulations with an anomaly exceeding 0 10 0 15 mg m 3 east of 140 w whereas this positive anomaly is reduced in assimts compared to noassim much stronger chl concentration anomalies are seen in assimall almost doubling the chl concentration in assimall the 0 10 mg m 3 contour extends farther west toward the western boundary currents that exhibit the strongest anomaly of chl concentration 0 20 mg m 3 note that the rms difference between model and satellite observations is more than two times higher in assimall 0 1mg m 3 than in noassim and assimts 0 05 mg m 3 and that the correlation is decreased see supplementary figure in fig 1d f vertical sections show the comparison of model nitrates with the woa18 climatology noassim and assimts have smaller nitrate vertical gradient compared to woa18 as seen by the positive anomaly above the thermocline and negative anomaly below again the assimall solution shows a much stronger concentration that extends all over the basin above the thermocline and below near the dateline the strong tightening of the nitrate isocontours over the whole equatorial band suggests that the significant changes of no 3 concentrations observed in assimall are caused by an upward displacement of the water column near the dateline note that the mean outgassing of co 2 to the atmosphere in the tropical pacific is increased by more than 50 in assimall going from around 0 5 pg yr 1 in noassim and assimts consistently with observations e g ishii et al 2014 to 0 8 pg yr 1 in assimall not shown to identify what explains the nitrate concentration differences between the simulations the components of the nitrate budget of assimall and differences from assimts are depth averaged in the equatorial euphotic zone the base of the euphotic layer is defined as the depth at which the incoming solar radiation represents 1 of the photosynthesis available radiation fig 2 compared to assimts stronger no 3 vertical advection is seen in assimall in the western pacific including along the boundary while stronger vertical diffusion is found in the central equatorial pacific both components vertical advection and diffusion plus the horizontal advection are the physical drivers bringing nitrates in the euphotic layer fig 2c it demonstrates that while the focus is traditionally on vertical processes this is more a three dimensional problem biological processes respond to this increased supply as seen in the sources minus sinks sms term fig 2d those are mostly due to the consumption by phytoplankton consistent with higher chl in this region as seen in fig 1 while the equatorial vertical advection flux has a difference of 0 040 mmol m 3 day between assimts and assimall in the western pacific the residual of physical and biological processes is of the order 0 001 mmol m 3 day that accumulates with time not shown consequently the modification of the no 3 vertical advection in assimall brings no 3 rich waters that stimulate the phytoplankton growth it also changes the nitrate balance between physical drivers and biological response that leads to a higher accumulation of nitrate of the order of o 0 1 mmol m 3 yr compared to assimts the no 3 vertical advection in assimall is mostly characterized by higher values west of the dateline in the euphotic layer and below the thermocline and above the thermocline east of it fig 3a these patterns reflect the no 3 stratification fig 1f to further investigate the causality of no 3 vertical advection differences between assimall and assimts it is useful to decompose it to separate changes due to the differences of no 3 concentrations from those due to the differences of vertical velocity as follows 1 w 1 z n 1 w 2 z n 2 w 1 w 2 2 z n 1 n 2 e f f e c t s o f no 3 d i f f w 1 w 2 z n 1 n 2 2 e f f e c t s o f w d i f f with w the vertical velocity z n the vertical gradient of no 3 and the indexes 1 and 2 referring to assimall and assimts respectively in fig 3b the effects of the vertical velocity differences are obvious west of the dateline with a positive anomaly extending from the near surface to at least 300 m explaining more than 95 of the vertical advective flux changes in fig 3c the effects of the differences in no 3 concentration shows a zonal dipole above the thermocline with negative values west of the date line and positive values east of it this pattern explaining more than 95 of the vertical advective flux changes above 300 m east of the date line suggests that an important part of the nitrates vertically advected in the western pacific are then transported to the east by the equatorial undercurrent euc this clearly demonstrates the key role of the vertical velocity in the observed changes of the no 3 concentration that brings rich nitrate waters to the upper layer which are then distributed in the whole equatorial pacific by the horizontal circulation based on a similar decomposition changes of the diffusion flux k z 1 z n 1 k z 2 z n 2 in the eastern pacific fig 2b are mostly due to changes due to the vertical gradient of nitrates resulting from the supply of waters rich in nitrates by vertical advection radenac et al 2019 rather than changes due to the mixing coefficient k z not shown several papers suggest that shocks during the assimilation procedures might cause modification in the mean vertical advection flux e g raghukumar et al 2015 in fig 3d boxplots of daily vertical velocity at 100 m are shown at three longitudes in the western equatorial pacific the variability of the vertical velocity does not significantly change between both simulations the whiskers are not longer in assimall as would be expected in the presence of data assimilation shocks rather the largest change is seen in the median vertical velocity with higher values in assimall than in assimts 1 m day this demonstrates the benefits of the iau methodology which smooths the impact of assimilation benkiran and greiner 2008 the mean rate of vertical nutrient input in the western pacific thus appears to be the key element explaining unrealistic accumulation of chl in the surface layer in assimall 3 2 temperature and current profiles the comparison of the three simulations is now carried out on the physical properties by investigating the changes on the thermal stratification and currents to provide a basin scale view the equatorial thermal structure in the upper 300 m is shown in fig 4 at the locations of four historical tao triton moorings 147 e 170 w 140 w 110 w by comparing vertical profiles of the reanalysis fields with the scripps argo product the strongest temperature difference is found at the thermocline level around 150 m in the west and 100 m in the east with magnitude reaching more than 2 c in the eastern pacific in the noassim fields a cold anomaly above a warm anomaly indicates that the vertical thermal gradient at the thermocline level from the model fields is smaller than that from observations i e the thermocline is too diffuse the diffuse thermocline is a recurring problem in numerical simulations stockdale et al 1998 tatebe and hasumi 2010 data assimilation in assimts and assimall successively improves the representation of the thermal structure in the central eastern pacific in the western pacific the benefits of data assimilation are only seen in the assimts fields in which the vertical thermal gradient at 150 m is slightly improved by contrast an important degradation is found in assimall with a cold anomaly reaching more than 1 c at 150 m therefore suggesting that the thermal stratification in the western equatorial pacific is strongly sensitive to the physical data assimilation this confirmed by the root mean square rms difference from the tao 100 m daily temperature computed in the western 147 e rms diff at 0 8 c 0 6 c 1 0 c and central pacific 140 w rms diff at 1 9 c 1 6 c 1 2 c for noassim assimts and assimall respectively note that using temperature fields from tao triton moorings having smaller vertical resolution rather than that from the argo product gives similar results the mean zonal velocity fields are then compared with the adcp current estimates provided by the tao triton array by only selecting model time steps corresponding to existing observations for computing the 2008 2014 time mean note that the velocity variables are not assimilated the amplitude and vertical shape of the subsurface maximum at the core of the eastward euc are well recovered in the noassim fields with the west east tilted shape and a magnitude reaching more than 1 m s in the core of the euc although still too shallow in the west and too deep in the east the euc is much better represented compared to previous studies fujii et al 2015 similarly to previous conclusions the two levels of data assimilation reduce the discrepancies between model and observations in the central eastern pacific but not in the western pacific for the assimall solution 4 what drives the vertical velocity to unravel the cause effect relations between mechanisms resulting from model dynamics and data assimilation procedures processes at play resulting in an increased vertical velocity in assimall are decomposed as individual steps first the changes in the upwelling rate are investigated with regards to the horizontal transports then it is demonstrated that most of changes in horizontal circulation are due to the modifications of the pressure field finally we show that biases in the mdt near the western boundary are sufficient to significantly modify the pressure gradient this point is then supported by dedicated experiments 4 1 equatorial upwelling and horizontal circulation fig 5a shows a map of the mean vertical velocity difference between assimall and assimts at 100 m that exhibits a stronger upwelling between 2 s and 2 n west of the dateline in assimall with differences reaching more than 1 m day in the far western pacific the vertical velocity in the ocean model is by definition derived online from the continuity equation u 0 with u the three dimensional velocity vector and thus is strictly dependent on horizontal currents the modification of the horizontal circulation is illustrated by the 0 100 m mass transport calculated from the velocity fields of the two simulations in two boxes of the western equatorial pacific between 2 s and 2 n 140 e 165 e and 165 e 170 w fig 5b the features of the large scale equatorial circulation are seen on both estimates that is the zonal westward flow increasing from east to west is dominated by the south equatorial current sec while the easterly trades winds lead to a meridional divergence in the ekman surface layer except at the southern side of the westernmost box due to the equatorward western boundary current the upwelling rate is deduced from the vertical velocity fields and corresponds to a tight interplay between horizontal transports though qualitatively similar the intensity of the upwelling is much higher in assimall especially in the far western pacific estimated at 1 sv in assimts and 10 sv in assimall the increased upwelling in assimall 9 sv compared to assimts compensates the changes in the meridional 6 sv and zonal 3 sv divergences in the eastern box the enhanced zonal divergence in assimall 4 in assimall compared to assimts is compensated by a reduced meridional divergence 1 sv resulting in changes of the upwelling rate of 3 sv in assimall compared to assimts the geostrophic component of the mass transport is shown in fig 5c while the zonal geostrophic component is still westward the geostrophic approximation can be used for estimating the sec picaut et al 1989 the geostrophic meridional currents are clearly equatorward the sum of horizontal geostrophic currents are thus convergent and most of the upwelling changes can be explained by a reduced meridional convergence in assimall due to geostrophy from 10 sv to 1 sv in the western box and from 35 sv to 30 sv in the eastern box the important modifications of the equatorial upwelling are thus the consequences of horizontal changes in both meridional and zonal directions and can be attributed to the pressure driven circulation geostrophic component 4 2 sea surface height and steric height since most of the modifications of the upwelling rate are related to the pressure driven circulation the mean ssh from assimall and the differences from assimts are shown in fig 6a in the northern pacific the trough around 8 n and the crest around 4 n mark the edges of the eastward north equatorial counter current while the large latitudinal extension of the trough south of 4 n indicates the position of the two branches of the westward sec johnson et al 2002 the meridional tilt of the isocontours reflects the strength of the currents and shows a maximum in the central and eastern pacific in agreement with johnson et al 2002 the main patterns of the ssh differences are the positive anomaly around 8 n the two negative lobes in the central pacific and the strong negative anomaly along the western boundary the positive anomaly at the 8 n trough combined with the negative anomaly at the 4 n crest reduce the tilt at the position of the necc that marks a decrease of the strength of the current this is confirmed by the surface current differences in fig 6b that show westward anomalies in the necc similarly the two lobes mark a reduction of the meridional tilt of the isocontours along the equator that indicates a decrease of the sec intensity in the equatorial band in the western boundary the important decrease of the ssh should result in a reduction of the equatorward western boundary currents given that the difference of the steric height at the surface relative to 300 m 0 300 sh between assimall and assimts in fig 6b shows similar patterns to that based on ssh fig 6a previous conclusions at the surface changes can be extended in subsurface note that the sh as the baroclinic component of the sea level is deduced from the density field and is integrative view of the thermohaline stratification similar patterns are seen on the difference of steric height at 100 m relative to 300 m between the two simulations in fig 6c indicating that ssh differences reflect modifications of the subsurface stratification the close relationship of the 100 m current anomalies with differences of the steric height at 100 m clearly indicates that the horizontal current differences are mainly driven by the changes of the pressure gradient additionally the equatorward western boundary circulation is significantly reduced at 3 5 s the northward mass transport in the 0 700 m layer from the western boundary to 170 e is reduced from 14 2 sv in assimts to 9 8 sv in assimall note that the mass transport at the entrance of the solomon sea is estimated at 15 sv from repeated glider transects davis et al 2012 all these modifications mainly driven by ssh changes are expected to act on the large scale circulation in modifying the mass transport from the pacific to the indian oceans through the indonesian throughflow kamenkovich et al 2003 this would require further investigations 4 3 zonal pressure gradient and the mean dynamic topography here we focus on the different features of the zonal pressure gradient several studies have shown that the zonal pressure gradient can be closely related to the zonal slope of the ssh e g nagura and mcphaden 2008 consequently in modifying the mean ssh the assimilation of altimetry by the addition of a mdt can potentially impact on the mean pressure gradient here we only consider changes of the zonal pressure gradient but similar conclusions can be made in the meridional direction the vertical structure of the mean zonal pressure gradient is presented in fig 7 lower panels in general the shape and amplitude of the zonal pressure gradient are consistent from that reported by historical studies mangum and hayes 1984 qiao and weisberg 1997 yu and mcphaden 1999 a zonal pattern is found in the two solutions with a weaker amplitude west of 170 e than in the central eastern pacific consistently with a weaker mean surface wind stress in the west yu and mcphaden 1999 in the central eastern pacific the zonal pressure gradient is clearly eastward above the thermocline with a maximum in the central pacific 5 10 7m s 2 the assimall minus assimts difference fig 7c indicates a large scale pattern with a significant negative anomaly 2 10 7 m s 2 in the western pacific and to a lesser extent in the far eastern pacific to understand the relationship of the zonal pressure gradient with the zonal gradient of ssh as identified in several studies yu and mcphaden 1999 nagura and mcphaden 2008 the zonal pressure gradient is vertically integrated in fig 7 upper panels as mentioned previously a minimum is found in the western pacific and a maximum in the central pacific looking specifically at the differences between assimall and assimts fig 7c changes of 2 10 5 m 2 s 2 in the depth integrated zonal pressure gradient in the western pacific correspond to changes of 2 10 7 m s 2 in the zonal gradient of the ssh in that region variations of the zonal pressure gradient are large yu and mcphaden 1999 and the amplitude of the assimall minus assimts difference is comparable to the magnitude of the variability occurring at seasonal to interannual time scales yu and mcphaden 1999 since an important difference between the assimts and the assimall solutions is the assimilation of the ssh anomaly provided by altimetry only assimilated in assimall a question is whether the use of a mdt to convert the model ssh in sea level anomaly sla such as s l a s s h m d t can generate large scale patterns in the zonal pressure gradient to address this question the 0 300 steric height 0 300 sh is computed from assimts and assimall temperature and salinity fields and compared with that computed from tao triton temperature combined with argo salinity fig 8a errors due to gaps in tao triton time series based on the difference between the mean 0 300 sh from the complete assimall fields and that from fields co located in time with the tao triton moorings are not significant lower than 1 cm not shown the 0 300 sh in the assimts and noassim is closer to observations than that in the assimall in the western pacific with differences reaching 7 cm at 137 e to determine if the mdt can be related with the sh discrepancy the mdt for the assimilation of altimetry in assimall is shown in fig 8 as well as the main components used in the mdt computation the observation based cnes cls13 mdt and the model mdt see hamon et al 2019 as each mdt is computed over a different period the sea level anomaly from the gridded duacs product averaged over the time period of each mdt has been removed from each estimate to remove the effects of the long term variability it shows that the zonal pattern of the cnes cls13 mdt similar to that of the latest version cnes cls18 mdt has a zonal slope that is more consistent with the slope of the tao triton 0 300 sh than the mdt used in assimall fig 8b this suggests that the cnes cls mdt is not responsible for the pattern of the mdt used in assimall the strong zonal slope of the mdt used in assimall mostly seen west of 160 e is rather due to the model mdt from the previous reanalysis glorys2v3 fig 8c see section 2 1 such mdt biases in the western pacific not sufficiently corrected during the mdt procedures hamon et al 2019 have important and problematic consequences for the physical bgc model consequently the computation of the mdt should be reevaluated with regards to these results however it is important to mention that obtaining a global accurate mdt resolving simultaneously equatorial regions high latitudes plus continental shelves are far to be straightforward and has rather to be seen as a long term process as will be shown the comparison of surface chlorophyll in the tropical pacific and nitrate concentration along the equatorial pacific shows that modified mdt strongly reduces differences from observations demonstrating that differences between assimts and assimall are mostly due to biases in the mdt 4 4 impact of altimetry assimilation with dedicated experiments as mentioned in section 2 differences between assimall and assimts are due to the assimilation of altimetry and the use of the seek filter the comparison of noalti with the control experiment allows to assess the sensitivity of the system due to the assimilation of altimetry the seek filter is used for in situ observations while the comparison with mdtpatch demonstrates the sensitivity due to the mdt in mdtpatch the modified mdt 5 cm along the equator around 165 e has been built from the sla residuals of the control run corresponding to the differences of the observed sla and the analyzed sla i e model sea surface height minus the mdt which have been bin averaged for the period june 2014 may 2015 fig 9 note that the zonal slope is strongly reduced fig 8c in fig 10a b a significant reduction of the vertical velocity 0 5 m day is seen in the western equatorial pacific on both mdtpatch and noalti experiments this is associated with a reduction of the cold bias seen in the control run 0 5 c fig 10c this supports the key role of the mdt in the mercator ocean system in triggering biases in equatorial physics note that reduction of the warm bias in the eastern pacific especially in noalti might reflect an inconsistency between satellite and in situ observations and this deserves to be further investigated later on in fig 11 bgc fields forced by the control run shows similar differences from observations than that forced with assimall fig 1 the western pacific is strongly productive with high concentration of surface chl and nitrates compared with the control run bgc fields forced by mdtpatch and noalti have smaller differences with observations demonstrating the key role of the mdt used for the assimilation procedures of altimetry in the issues seen in the tropical pacific physics and biogeochemistry in the mercator ocean system 5 interpretation of the temperature balance having revealed the mechanisms that lead to an increase in the vertical velocity in the western pacific due to the assimilation of altimetry we discuss the consequences of such modifications in terms of the heat balance in the mean the significant amplification of equatorial upwelling in the western pacific bringing cold deep waters in the surface layer raises the question of the heat balance especially with regards to the strong cold anomaly found in assimall in the western pacific around 150 m fig 4a 2 t t u x t v y t w z t a d v q n e t ρ 0 c p h h f i n c t i n c r where the angle brackets denote the depth integration over the upper 300 m adv represents the advection term hf is the net heat flux with ρ 0 the density of sea water 1025 kg m 3 and c p the heat capacity 3940 j kg c inc is the temperature increment correction to apply to the model due to data assimilation in assimts the increment is only a large scale temperature correction while in assimall the temperature increment is the weighted sum of the large scale temperature one and the small scale one coming from the multivariate seek filter the term r is a residual which includes entrainment horizontal and vertical mixing to understand the role of data assimilation on the mean heat balance the mean temperature increments averaged in the 0 300 m layer from the assimts and assimall simulations are shown in fig 12 on average data assimilation slightly cools the eastern equatorial pacific in assimts compared to assimts the mean temperature increment in assimall is much stronger and the pattern is a dipole with a significant warming west of the dateline and cooling east of it the magnitude of the warming reaches 1 c month in the far western pacific the sum of the advection and heat flux terms are shown infig 12b d while the net heat flux contribution mainly results from the atmospheric forcing the advection term is obtained by computing monthly averages of each component of term a in eq 2 from daily fields of temperature and velocity the clear correspondence between fig 12c and d but with opposite sign indicates that mean temperature increment is related with the net heat flux and advection terms while the surface heat flux is almost unchanged the contribution of advection is determinant in controlling temperature increments actually most of heat advection in assimall is due to the vertical component not shown for comparison the mean net heat flux in the niño 3 box 150 w 90 w 5 s 5 n is lower than 0 2 c mon indicating that the warming applied by data assimilation is huge with regards to the mean heat balance given the magnitude of the mean temperature increments compared to the net heat flux we now consider the long term evolution of the ocean heat content long term changes of steric height from data assimilation systems can be inconsistent with observation based estimates storto et al 2018 gasparin et al 2018 the ocean heat content ohc evolution is computed from o h c ρ 0 c p 300 m 0 t d z with t the anomaly from the 2008 2014 mean fig 13a shows the ocean heat content integrated in the tropical pacific 170 e 100 w 12 s 12 n from the scripps argo product assimts and assimall estimates while assimts is in agreement with argo 0 14 1022 j yr the ohc from assimall is two times higher 0 29 1022 j yr finally to evaluate the possibility that changing the mean heat balance might induce a spurious ocean heat gain the assimall minus assimts ohc difference only based on temperature fields is compared with ohc differences from reconstructed time series by integrating the sum of the advection net heat flux and temperature increment terms this comparison demonstrates that the modification of the mean heat balance by inconsistent mean temperature increment likely results in a higher mean local warming 6 conclusion and discussion the general framework of this study is a well known persistent problem in physical bgc models regarding an unrealistic chl surface concentration and an unrealistic accumulation of nitrates in the tropical pacific when forced by outputs from physical reanalyses given the strong sensitivity of bgc models to the physical forcing in that region the present study has assessed the consequences of physical data assimilation on the representation of the mean dynamics from a set of three sister ocean reanalysis runs that use the same physical bgc model configuration but that differ in their level of physical data assimilation based on a series of simple cause effect mechanisms it is shown that the sensitivity of the bgc model in the tropical pacific to physical data assimilation is mainly related to important differences in the intensity of the mean equatorial upwelling in the western equatorial pacific resulting from changes in the pressure field the western tropical pacific has a key role in the dynamics of the whole tropical pacific in our physical bgc model consistently with results from the seasonal forecasting system at ecmwf balmaseda and anderson 2009 based on the analysis of the nitrate budget in the equatorial euphotic layer the simulation having both levels of data assimilation assimall a 3d var large scale t s correction and a multivariate correction applied on the prognostic variables from the seek filter is mainly characterized by an unrealistic vertical advection flux of nitrates in the western pacific these nitrates are then distributed along the whole equatorial basin by the horizontal circulation nearly all the excess of nitrates is consumed through biological processes that explain the higher chl concentrations at the sea surface additionally as the vertical input of nitrates is not totally compensated by the consumption of biological processes small positive residuals cause a long term accumulation of nitrates in the tropical band moreover the analysis of the vertical velocity reveals that changes in the vertical advection flux is driven by the mean value rather than the small scale variability associated with potential assimilation shocks the signature of the enhanced upwelling in the western equatorial pacific is seen in vertical sections of the thermal stratification and currents with an upward displacement of the isolines resulting by definition from the continuity equation the changes of the vertical velocity reflect the modifications of the zonal and meridional circulations we point out that biases in the mdt required for referencing the sea level anomaly provided by altimetry have strong impacts on the tropical circulation in the whole basin in modifying the mean ssh the mdt changes the subsurface pressure field associated with the thermohaline stratification additionally these biases of the mdt lead to an unrealistic long term ocean warming in the tropical pacific in fact the vertical flux of cold water due to the increased upwelling in the western pacific induces a strong temperature increment reaching 1 c mon equivalent to five times the surface heat flux however the upwelled cold water and the warm increments are not totally balanced causing a local heat excess in the whole tropical basin the assimilation of altimetric sea level anomaly is important for representing key mechanisms for biogeochemistry in the equatorial pacific such as tropical instability waves e g gorgues et al 2005 further investigations are thus needed to refine the mdt it may be tempting to apply a correction patch based on the mean difference between altimetry and the model as done in the experiments but ocean reanalyses are based on atmospheric forcing model processes and data assimilation with errors in surface forcing and modeled processes compensated by data assimilation in constraining thermohaline stratification and ssh data assimilation modifies one of the components of this balance without significantly changing the net surface forcing wind stress heat and freshwater fluxes resulting in disturbing the initial balance however the temptation to artificially modify one of the components of the system toward keeping some theoretical balance can be counterproductive given the continuous evolution of the elements of the system several improvements of the mdt computation and of the assimilation techniques are expected to improve the general balance as the computation of the mdt combines satellites and in situ measurements its local accuracy depends on the evolution of the global ocean observing system while the advent gravimetric data have improved our knowledge of the earth s geoid castruccio et al 2008 rio et al 2013 more advanced techniques will increase the resolution of the mdt and include more accurate details of the ocean circulation knudsen et al 2019 additionally enhancing in situ measurements are also essential for refining the accuracy of the mdt rio et al 2011 while the first deployments of argo floats with argos antenna were strongly sensitive to the equatorial divergence gasparin et al 2015 recent deployments of floats equipped with iridium antenna may be of great interest although the accuracy of the mdt will progress over time this study demonstrates that error statistics of the mdt is important for operational systems as mentioned in section 2 1 the mdt and sla errors are estimated by the desroziers method at a scale of about 150 km which is consistent with altimetric information however fig 8 shows that there is larger scale bias of the order of 10 of longitude which is not considered in the current approach further work is needed to estimate the error and bias jointly rather than using the desroziers non bias hypothesis this analysis ends up pointing out the key role of the mdt during the assimilation procedures of altimetry in the mercator ocean system however it is important to mention that our conclusions do not hold in other operational systems assimilating only t s profiles with similar issues while et al 2010 park et al 2018b the question of why the issue is not seen in assimts is a reasonable one we argue that by introducing a supplementary force in the prognostic model equations the iau reduces the imbalance between the pressure gradient force and the atmospheric forcing as shown in the north atlantic due to an initial mdt bias lower than 2 cm benkiran and greiner 2008 while et al 2010 thus this study demonstrates that the iau is not sufficient in the tropical pacific where the mdt bias can reach 7 cm over more than 3000 km however we hope that our study will stimulate other careful diagnostics of the physics to help better understand the causes of the vertical velocity biases that may differ from the mercator ocean system as demonstrated here this goes through a better understanding of the physics and biogeochemistry in the equatorial pacific and in situ observations from the tropical pacific observing system tpos will strongly contribute to it several follow on aspects of tpos that are fundamental for physical bgc models are pointed out by the present study velocity measurements in the surface and subsurface layers are unique information for data assimilation systems because they are not assimilated and constitute independent data sets for assessing and improving the representation of the ocean circulation by physical models bgc measurements along the water column from argo floats are also strongly required to evaluate improve and eventually assimilate it into models while the ocean color dataset is commonly assimilated in bgc models ford et al 2018 significant work is needed for assimilating bgc floats our objective has been to quantitatively assess the capabilities of the physical bgc model in the tropical pacific and to provide some elements to the evolving design of the tpos smith et al 2019 this integrated vision from physical bgc models illustrates that the contribution of ocean observations for ocean models should thus be evaluated by its direct impact on systems evaluation and data assimilation but also by its indirect impact through the mdt that can be equivalent balmaseda and anderson 2009 finally this study demonstrates that looking into details of the physics is indispensable to improve physical data assimilation systems to better understand their relationship with bgc models and to ensure that they make the best use of oceanic observations credit authorship contribution statement florent gasparin conceptualization writing original draft sophie cravatte writing

23911,monitoring and predicting global ocean biogeochemistry and marine ecosystems is one of the biggest challenges for the coming decade in operational systems biogeochemical bgc models are forced or coupled with physical ocean models fields that are generally constrained by data assimilation of temperature salinity and sea level anomalies yet while physical data assimilation substantially improves simulated physical fields bgc models forced by such analyses are commonly degraded and more especially in equatorial regions here impacts of physical data assimilation on surface chlorophyll and nitrate concentrations are investigated in the tropical pacific based on three ocean reanalysis runs using the same physical bgc model configuration but differing in their level of physical data assimilation it is shown that in the mercator ocean operational system the assimilation of satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature in addition to temperature and salinity in situ profiles leads to spurious vertical velocities in the western equatorial pacific our analysis suggests that these unrealistic vertical velocities are explained by the use of an inaccurate mean dynamic topography for the assimilation of altimetry that modifies the pressure driven horizontal circulation in the upper ocean layer moreover the biases found in this key region modify the subtle dynamical and bgc balances in the whole tropical pacific and result in unrealistic trends of ocean heat content and nitrate concentration this study demonstrates that looking into details of the physics is indispensable to improve physical data assimilation systems and to ensure that they make the best use of observations this is also a key point to refine the strategy of the bgc models forcing and further improve ocean predictions keywords physical biogeochemical models mean dynamic topography data assimilation vertical velocity tropical pacific observing system 1 introduction in the tropical pacific ocean atmosphere interactions occurring at different spatial and temporal scales drive the strongest mode of interannual variability namely the el niño southern oscillation enso wang et al 2017 numerous studies have shown that biogeochemistry and marine ecosystems are significantly affected by the enso related oceanic conditions not only in the tropical pacific e g loukos et al 2000 radenac et al 2012 but also in remote regions e g feely et al 1995 martínez lópez and zavala hidalgo 2009 machado et al 2013 in turn phytoplankton concentration in the surface layer can also have significant effects on its physical environment by reducing the solar penetration into the ocean and thereby affect the temperature and air sea interaction and induce positive feedback onto enso by heating effects park et al 2018a zhang et al 2019 significant progress in the understanding of enso related mechanisms has resulted from intense efforts of observation and modeling over the last four decades guilyardi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 yet important biases in physical and biogeochemical bgc models remain and limit our understanding of ocean mechanisms occurring at local to global scales and over diurnal to multidecadal periods in this context physical ocean reanalyses are a powerful tool that combines information from model dynamics surface fluxes and observation data sets to provide a dynamically consistent ocean state in the four dimensions storto et al 2019 following the development of remote sensing and in situ observations together with progress in modeling and data assimilation techniques these relevant monitoring tools are now identified as a centerpiece of climate research e g mayer et al 2018 unlike non assimilative ocean models reanalyses benefit from multivariate ocean data assimilation and model bias mitigation methods serving as a constraint to reduce systematic biases and long term drifts resulting from errors in initialization air sea flux formulation and process parameterization compared to objective analyses only based on observations ocean reanalyses use model dynamics counteracting the lack of information in sparsely observed regions to monitor and predict ocean biogeochemistry and marine ecosystems physical ocean reanalyses are now coupled or used as forcing fields to bgc or ecological models fennel et al 2019 but counter intuitively physical data assimilation solutions do not systematically produce better bgc fields than non assimilative solutions ford et al 2018 in fact bgc fields are even commonly degraded when forced by physics with data assimilation ourmières et al 2009 while et al 2010 raghukumar et al 2015 park et al 2018b this problem is exacerbated around the equator in global models while et al 2010 park et al 2018b but has also been observed in regional models raghukumar et al 2015 in controlling the amount of nutrients and carbon available at the surface ocean vertical velocity is a key variable for physical bgc models and numerous studies have pointed out that spurious vertical velocity is a persistent problem in physical ocean reanalyses these important implications for bgc models are not restricted to a specific ocean model or data assimilation system waters et al 2017 ford et al 2018 and have thus pushed the physical oceanography community to further investigate vertical physics during data assimilation procedures unrealistic vertical velocity results from dynamical imbalance between the wind stress and the pressure gradient of data assimilation updates bell et al 2004 several studies have proposed specific techniques to prevent the data assimilation from degrading vertical velocity burgers et al 2002 demonstrated that including zonal velocity corrections in geostrophic balance with density corrections improves the representation of equatorial currents bell et al 2004 and more recently waters et al 2017 proposed to adapt the pressure density correction during the data assimilation step in order to maintain the dynamical balance between the wind stress and the pressure gradient along the equator a more pragmatic technique consisting in modulating the weight of data assimilation in sensitive regions gives positive results park et al 2018b but this choice is not fully satisfactory because it reduces the gain of data assimilation on horizontal physics while encouraging results have been obtained the vertical velocity issue associated with issues in other physical variables remains an important limitation of bgc models ford et al 2018 here we address this specific issue in the mercator ocean system focusing on the tropical pacific ocean based on an ensemble of three 7 yr physical ocean reanalysis fields hydrology and currents using the same ocean model configuration but varying the complexity and the level of data assimilation we will show that when the physical solution with both in situ and satellite observations is used as forcing fields for a bgc model unrealistic chlorophyll concentrations are observed in the equatorial band associated with higher vertical velocity section 4 in fact the assimilation of sea level anomaly requires a reference height the mean dynamic topography mdt defined as the difference between the mean sea surface and the earth s geoid uncertainty on the mdt can significantly impact on the quality of analyses and forecasts birol et al 2004 vidard et al 2009 yan et al 2015 hamon et al 2019 and significant improvements of ocean monitoring systems have been attributed to a more accurate mdt lellouche et al 2018 guiavarc h et al 2019 the western tropical pacific is known as a complex region the main focus here is to detail how the biases of the mdt here the term bias refers to error in the mdt modify the three dimensional oceanic circulation in the equatorial pacific and eventually the bgc fields this study will also determine how the changes in the mean properties can affect the representation of the long term variability that remains a challenge for ocean reanalyses storto et al 2019 even if significant improvement has been achieved for representing the steric sea level interannual variability in ocean reanalyses large discrepancies between estimates of interannual trends are still observed storto et al 2017 a recent study of gasparin et al 2018 showed that global patterns of changes of ocean heat and freshwater contents at interannual timescales are significantly improved with data assimilation but the amplitude is two times stronger than estimates from observations we will show here that biases in the mdt can produce unrealistic long term drift of the thermosteric component of the steric sea level through modifications of the ocean heat content in the following we begin with a description of the physical bgc model and the in situ and satellite observation products section 2 which have been used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the physics and biogeochemistry to the level of physical data assimilation section 3 then some simple dynamical arguments are given in section 4 to demonstrate how the use of a biased mdt for the assimilation of altimetry causes unrealistic upwelling by reducing the horizontal convergence in the western equatorial pacific finally the sensitivity of the evolution of the ocean heat content to the changes of the mean oceanic circulation is analyzed in light of previous results in section 5 conclusion and discussion are provided in section 6 2 ocean reanalysis simulations assimilation experiments and validation data sets 2 1 physical model and data assimilation procedures this work is mainly built upon a series of three 7 yr global ocean simulations which have been performed in the context of the global high resolution ocean monitoring and forecasting system operated in near real time by the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems since 19 october 2016 these runs have been originally presented in lellouche et al 2018 the system was run from october 2006 to october 2016 toward the real time regime assimilating the reprocessed observations along track altimetric sea level anomaly sla satellite sea surface temperature sst sea ice concentration in situ temperature and salinity vertical profiles t s profiles to quantify impacts of the main different components of the assimilation system two other twin numerical simulations that use the same ocean model configuration but that differ by their assimilation level of observation data sets have been performed over a similar period october 2006 december 2014 the model component is based on the version 3 1 of the nemo ocean model with a 1 12 orca grid type with a horizontal resolution of 9 km at the equator 7 km at mid latitudes and 2 km near the poles the water column is composed of 50 vertical levels including 22 levels within the upper 100 m with 1 m resolution at the surface and 450 m resolution at the bottom the forcing atmospheric fields are obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts integrated forecast system ecmwf ifs at 3 h resolution in order to reproduce the diurnal cycle this system has been initialized using temperature and salinity profiles from the en4 monthly gridded climatology good et al 2013 averaged for the period october december 2006 more details concerning parameterization of the terms included in the momentum heat and freshwater balances i e advection diffusion mixing or surface flux can be found in lellouche et al 2018 satellite altimetry sea surface temperature sst and sea ice concentration observations operationally produced by cmems http marine copernicus eu are assimilated in the system this consists of along track sea level anomaly data from the data unification and altimeter combination system duacs multi mission altimeter products and gridded ostia sst operational sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis which combines satellite sst data group for high resolution sea surface temperature project ghrsst with in situ observations donlon et al 2012 additionally satellite sea ice concentration from the eumetsat ocean and sea ice satellite application facility osi saf is assimilated subsurface vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from the cora 4 1 in situ database cabanes et al 2013 szekely et al 2016 are also assimilated this database includes vertical temperature and salinity profiles from argo floats moorings gliders expendable bathythermograph xbt transects sea mammals and conductivity temperature depth ctd casts from oceanographic cruises low quality profiles were excluded after several quality control tests were performed as described in lellouche et al 2018 observation data sets are assimilated using data assimilation techniques detailed in lellouche et al 2013 2018 and only the necessary elements to interpret results are presented here the main components of the data assimilation procedures are i a 3d var correction for the slowly evolving large scale error of the model in temperature and salinity based on in situ t s profiles over the last month and ii a reduced order kalman filter derived from a singular evolutive extended kalman filter seek brasseur and verron 2006 with a three dimensional multivariate modal decomposition of the background error and a 7 day assimilation cycle this multivariate procedure considers satellite and in situ observations and presumably corrects patterns at smaller spatial and temporal scales mesoscale activity than the 3d var correction in practice temperature and salinity observation are selected depending on the innovation value defined as the observation minus model forecast equivalent for the 3d var corrections innovations are considered on a 1 month window i e at a given 7 day cycle and the three previous cycles and depending on the horizontal distance of the order of 400 500 km in order to map large scale temperature and salinity corrections for the assimilation of the seek filter the analysis at a given point is based on surrounded innovations determined by spatial and temporal correlation scales ranging from 50 to 450 km in the zonal direction from 50 to 200 km in the meridional direction and from 3 to 15 days from the innovations and specified observation errors the seek filter generates a localized analysis increment which is a linear combination of short scale anomalies from a statistical ensemble representative of the forecast error covariances lellouche et al 2013 the 3d var correction and the seek increment are applied progressively using the incremental analysis update iau method another tendency term added in the model prognostic equations to avoid model shock every week due to the imbalance between the analysis increments and the model physics bloom et al 1996 benkiran and greiner 2008 to be comparable with the observed sla provided by altimetry the model sea surface height ssh is converted to sla relative to a reference mean ssh consequently the assimilation procedure of altimetry results in assimilating the altimetric sla but also the reference mean ssh in the context of numerical models having a spherical ellipsoid the mean ssh is equivalent to the mdt several approaches can be adopted an observation based mdt gathering in situ hydrologic and drifter data and gravimetric satellites observations would correct the mean state of the model however the use of such mdt can be damaging in some regions due to the inaccuracy of the mdt and or important model biases vidard et al 2009 additionally the spatial resolution of the estimates only based on observations around 100 km might not be consistent with that of the model here at 1 12 the mean ssh from the model may also be used directly as the mdt in that case model biases are not corrected and only temporal and spatial variability embedded in the altimetric anomalies is assimilated in practice long term reanalysis fields are preferred to get a more accurate estimate of the mean sea surface as done in the ecmwf system in which only t s observations are assimilated zuo et al 2019 they found large temperature and salinity biases in regions with strong mesoscale eddy activity i e along the western boundary currents and the antarctic circumpolar current some systems use a bias correction to correct for biases in the mdt during the assimilation e g lea et al 2008 in the present study the mdt results from a combination of model and observation based mdts following a complex iterative procedure using statistics from the previous reanalysis glorys2v3 the observed mdt cnes cls13 the 2014 version of the grace and goce data as well as the world ocean atlas woa 2013 climatology more details in hamon et al 2019 the error variance associated with the mdt estimate is an important information during the assimilation of altimetry to refine the sla error associated with each satellite lellouche et al 2018 as error associated with each data set used for the mdt computation is poorly known a boot strap estimation method based on the work of desroziers et al 2005 is used in addition an ensemble method is applied to overcome uncertainty in error statistics such as the correlation function or the error magnitude of each observation data set the final mdt error scale of about 150 km is computed by combining the dispersion of the ensemble members 36 members with the final error estimates produced by desroziers et al 2005 since the ensemble is relatively small an amplification of the dispersion is applied to obtain the level estimated by desroziers et al 2005 theoretically the sla error is optimal if there is no bias desroziers et al 2005 which is generally the case however the equatorial pacific is a notable exception where there is an inconsistency between sets of observations not shown likely related to gravimetric error and or non negligible contribution of deep steric height and ocean mass 2 2 biogeochemical model the bgc component of the physical bgc model is based on the model pisces pelagic interactions scheme for carbon and ecosystem studies distributed in the nemo framework based on coarsening algorithm the 1 12 physical daily fields have been degraded to the 1 4 horizontal resolution of the bgc model aumont et al 1998 to force the bgc model note that the coarsening algorithm allows to conserve the total volume contained in the 1 12 fields and maintain non divergence berthet et al 2019 pisces v2 aumont et al 2015 is a model of intermediate complexity with 24 prognostic variables which simulates the bgc cycles of oxygen carbon and major nutrients phosphate nitrate iron silicate controlling phytoplankton growth the model has been initialized with the world ocean atlas 2013 climatology for nitrate phosphate oxygen and silicate garcia et al 2013 and with the glodap v2 global ocean data analysis project version 2 climatology for the dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity lauvset et al 2016 2 3 ocean reanalysis simulations and assimilation experiments the set of ocean reanalysis fields including temperature salinity three dimensional velocity and sea surface height variables is composed of a free simulation with no data assimilation and two data assimilation simulations on one hand using only the 3d var large scale correction based on in situ temperature and salinity t s profiles on the other hand using the 3d var correction combined with a multivariate kalman filter considering t s profiles and satellite information of sea level anomaly and sea surface temperature note that including altimetry is fundamental for constraining the mesoscale structure to distinguish the three simulations by their level of data assimilation the first analogous simulation is called noassim without any data assimilation and the second one which only benefits from the large scale t s correction using in situ t s profiles is called assimts the simulation serving the operational system which uses a multivariate seek in addition to the large scale t s correction is referred as assimall table 1 as altimetry is assimilated by the mean of the seek filter only used in assimall differences between assimall and assimts are thus due to the assimilation of altimetry and the use of the seek filter note that the assimilation of sst is negligible for our study not shown the last two simulations performed over a period of several years with the same model configuration and reprocessed observation data sets are thus considered as ocean reanalysis fields as the ocean model state is stabilized i e it reaches the eddy kinetic energy maximum in about 6 months in the upper 1000 m with data assimilation or 12 months without assimilation lellouche et al 2018 the fields have been considered over the 2008 2014 period in this study it is noteworthy that the issue is not depended on the variability e g vertical velocity differences between simulations are not modulated by el niño in addition to the 7 yr simulations three 1 5 yr extra experiments have been performed to separate the effects on physical and biogeochemical fields due to the mdt for the assimilation of altimetry from those due to the use of the seek filter to reduce computational costs these experiments are based on an experimental system similar to that of the three reanalysis runs but at 1 4 horizontal resolution hamon et al 2019 over a 1 5 yr period the configuration is based on the version 3 1 of the nemo ocean model with 50 vertical levels forced by the ecmwf ifs atmospheric fields the model has been initialized in 1 january 2014 using temperature and salinity profiles from woa13 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 assimilation procedures have used the same datasets as in the assimall simulation i e satellite sst satellite sla in situ vertical profiles and sea ice concentration and the same techniques the 3d var correction and the seek filter the reference experiment called the control run uses the same mdt as assimall for the altimetry assimilation and only differs from assimall by the ogcm resolution and the time period this reference simulation will be compared with a second experiment noalti in which altimetric data are withheld t s profiles are used in the 3d var correction and the seek filter to assess the sensitivity of the physical bgc model to the mdt a third experiment named mdtpatch and only differing from the control run by the mdt will uses a patched mdt this will be further explained in section 4 4 these three physical fields have then been used to force the same bgc model than in section 2 2 the 1 yr segment from june 2014 to may 2015 has been periodically repeated over a 6 yr period to assess the long term evolution of biogeochemical variables it is noteworthy that even if this experimental procedure does not consider any interannual variability and might include discontinuity between repeated segments the intercomparison of these experiments allows to quantify the effects of physical data assimilation on bgc fields 2 4 validation datasets to evaluate the skills of the different bgc solutions surface chlorophyll chl estimates from the cmems globcolour product and nitrate fields from woa18 have been considered the cmems globcolour product 1997 present

2012 present and olci s3 a 2016 present this product is distributed by cmems garnesson et al 2019 the annual mean of nitrates from woa2018 consists of fields on a 1 1 spatial grid and are obtained from an optimal analysis based on high quality oceanographic in situ observations over the period 1955 2018 garcia et al 2018 in addition to bgc variables gridded monthly in situ temperature and salinity fields have been provided by the scripps argo climatology since 2004 for the global ocean roemmich and gilson 2009 gasparin et al 2015 and have been downloaded from the dedicated scripps argo

averaged vertical profiles of currents estimated from acoustic doppler current profilers adcp on tao triton moorings have been downloaded from the global tropical mooring buoy array www pmel noaa gov gtmba adcp are available along the equator at 156 e 165 e 170 w 140 w 110 w over the whole period this single instrument datasets are preferred to gridded products including multiple data sources to ensure independence between comparison products 3 sensitivity of physics and biogeochemistry to physical data assimilation as mentioned in the introduction the present work has been firstly motivated by a persistent issue in most ocean reanalyses highlighted by over productive bgc models in the equatorial band likely due to spurious vertical velocity by comparing with observations the aim here is to evaluate the model solutions by investigating bgc and physical environments through the surface chl the nitrate concentration and vertical profiles of temperature and horizontal velocity 3 1 chlorophyll and nitrates fig 1 shows surface chl and vertical sections of nitrates no 3 along the equator with contours indicating model estimates and color shading is used for the discrepancy from the observation based product globcolour and woa2018 the surface chl shows an over productive eastern pacific in the three simulations with an anomaly exceeding 0 10 0 15 mg m 3 east of 140 w whereas this positive anomaly is reduced in assimts compared to noassim much stronger chl concentration anomalies are seen in assimall almost doubling the chl concentration in assimall the 0 10 mg m 3 contour extends farther west toward the western boundary currents that exhibit the strongest anomaly of chl concentration 0 20 mg m 3 note that the rms difference between model and satellite observations is more than two times higher in assimall 0 1mg m 3 than in noassim and assimts 0 05 mg m 3 and that the correlation is decreased see supplementary figure in fig 1d f vertical sections show the comparison of model nitrates with the woa18 climatology noassim and assimts have smaller nitrate vertical gradient compared to woa18 as seen by the positive anomaly above the thermocline and negative anomaly below again the assimall solution shows a much stronger concentration that extends all over the basin above the thermocline and below near the dateline the strong tightening of the nitrate isocontours over the whole equatorial band suggests that the significant changes of no 3 concentrations observed in assimall are caused by an upward displacement of the water column near the dateline note that the mean outgassing of co 2 to the atmosphere in the tropical pacific is increased by more than 50 in assimall going from around 0 5 pg yr 1 in noassim and assimts consistently with observations e g ishii et al 2014 to 0 8 pg yr 1 in assimall not shown to identify what explains the nitrate concentration differences between the simulations the components of the nitrate budget of assimall and differences from assimts are depth averaged in the equatorial euphotic zone the base of the euphotic layer is defined as the depth at which the incoming solar radiation represents 1 of the photosynthesis available radiation fig 2 compared to assimts stronger no 3 vertical advection is seen in assimall in the western pacific including along the boundary while stronger vertical diffusion is found in the central equatorial pacific both components vertical advection and diffusion plus the horizontal advection are the physical drivers bringing nitrates in the euphotic layer fig 2c it demonstrates that while the focus is traditionally on vertical processes this is more a three dimensional problem biological processes respond to this increased supply as seen in the sources minus sinks sms term fig 2d those are mostly due to the consumption by phytoplankton consistent with higher chl in this region as seen in fig 1 while the equatorial vertical advection flux has a difference of 0 040 mmol m 3 day between assimts and assimall in the western pacific the residual of physical and biological processes is of the order 0 001 mmol m 3 day that accumulates with time not shown consequently the modification of the no 3 vertical advection in assimall brings no 3 rich waters that stimulate the phytoplankton growth it also changes the nitrate balance between physical drivers and biological response that leads to a higher accumulation of nitrate of the order of o 0 1 mmol m 3 yr compared to assimts the no 3 vertical advection in assimall is mostly characterized by higher values west of the dateline in the euphotic layer and below the thermocline and above the thermocline east of it fig 3a these patterns reflect the no 3 stratification fig 1f to further investigate the causality of no 3 vertical advection differences between assimall and assimts it is useful to decompose it to separate changes due to the differences of no 3 concentrations from those due to the differences of vertical velocity as follows 1 w 1 z n 1 w 2 z n 2 w 1 w 2 2 z n 1 n 2 e f f e c t s o f no 3 d i f f w 1 w 2 z n 1 n 2 2 e f f e c t s o f w d i f f with w the vertical velocity z n the vertical gradient of no 3 and the indexes 1 and 2 referring to assimall and assimts respectively in fig 3b the effects of the vertical velocity differences are obvious west of the dateline with a positive anomaly extending from the near surface to at least 300 m explaining more than 95 of the vertical advective flux changes in fig 3c the effects of the differences in no 3 concentration shows a zonal dipole above the thermocline with negative values west of the date line and positive values east of it this pattern explaining more than 95 of the vertical advective flux changes above 300 m east of the date line suggests that an important part of the nitrates vertically advected in the western pacific are then transported to the east by the equatorial undercurrent euc this clearly demonstrates the key role of the vertical velocity in the observed changes of the no 3 concentration that brings rich nitrate waters to the upper layer which are then distributed in the whole equatorial pacific by the horizontal circulation based on a similar decomposition changes of the diffusion flux k z 1 z n 1 k z 2 z n 2 in the eastern pacific fig 2b are mostly due to changes due to the vertical gradient of nitrates resulting from the supply of waters rich in nitrates by vertical advection radenac et al 2019 rather than changes due to the mixing coefficient k z not shown several papers suggest that shocks during the assimilation procedures might cause modification in the mean vertical advection flux e g raghukumar et al 2015 in fig 3d boxplots of daily vertical velocity at 100 m are shown at three longitudes in the western equatorial pacific the variability of the vertical velocity does not significantly change between both simulations the whiskers are not longer in assimall as would be expected in the presence of data assimilation shocks rather the largest change is seen in the median vertical velocity with higher values in assimall than in assimts 1 m day this demonstrates the benefits of the iau methodology which smooths the impact of assimilation benkiran and greiner 2008 the mean rate of vertical nutrient input in the western pacific thus appears to be the key element explaining unrealistic accumulation of chl in the surface layer in assimall 3 2 temperature and current profiles the comparison of the three simulations is now carried out on the physical properties by investigating the changes on the thermal stratification and currents to provide a basin scale view the equatorial thermal structure in the upper 300 m is shown in fig 4 at the locations of four historical tao triton moorings 147 e 170 w 140 w 110 w by comparing vertical profiles of the reanalysis fields with the scripps argo product the strongest temperature difference is found at the thermocline level around 150 m in the west and 100 m in the east with magnitude reaching more than 2 c in the eastern pacific in the noassim fields a cold anomaly above a warm anomaly indicates that the vertical thermal gradient at the thermocline level from the model fields is smaller than that from observations i e the thermocline is too diffuse the diffuse thermocline is a recurring problem in numerical simulations stockdale et al 1998 tatebe and hasumi 2010 data assimilation in assimts and assimall successively improves the representation of the thermal structure in the central eastern pacific in the western pacific the benefits of data assimilation are only seen in the assimts fields in which the vertical thermal gradient at 150 m is slightly improved by contrast an important degradation is found in assimall with a cold anomaly reaching more than 1 c at 150 m therefore suggesting that the thermal stratification in the western equatorial pacific is strongly sensitive to the physical data assimilation this confirmed by the root mean square rms difference from the tao 100 m daily temperature computed in the western 147 e rms diff at 0 8 c 0 6 c 1 0 c and central pacific 140 w rms diff at 1 9 c 1 6 c 1 2 c for noassim assimts and assimall respectively note that using temperature fields from tao triton moorings having smaller vertical resolution rather than that from the argo product gives similar results the mean zonal velocity fields are then compared with the adcp current estimates provided by the tao triton array by only selecting model time steps corresponding to existing observations for computing the 2008 2014 time mean note that the velocity variables are not assimilated the amplitude and vertical shape of the subsurface maximum at the core of the eastward euc are well recovered in the noassim fields with the west east tilted shape and a magnitude reaching more than 1 m s in the core of the euc although still too shallow in the west and too deep in the east the euc is much better represented compared to previous studies fujii et al 2015 similarly to previous conclusions the two levels of data assimilation reduce the discrepancies between model and observations in the central eastern pacific but not in the western pacific for the assimall solution 4 what drives the vertical velocity to unravel the cause effect relations between mechanisms resulting from model dynamics and data assimilation procedures processes at play resulting in an increased vertical velocity in assimall are decomposed as individual steps first the changes in the upwelling rate are investigated with regards to the horizontal transports then it is demonstrated that most of changes in horizontal circulation are due to the modifications of the pressure field finally we show that biases in the mdt near the western boundary are sufficient to significantly modify the pressure gradient this point is then supported by dedicated experiments 4 1 equatorial upwelling and horizontal circulation fig 5a shows a map of the mean vertical velocity difference between assimall and assimts at 100 m that exhibits a stronger upwelling between 2 s and 2 n west of the dateline in assimall with differences reaching more than 1 m day in the far western pacific the vertical velocity in the ocean model is by definition derived online from the continuity equation u 0 with u the three dimensional velocity vector and thus is strictly dependent on horizontal currents the modification of the horizontal circulation is illustrated by the 0 100 m mass transport calculated from the velocity fields of the two simulations in two boxes of the western equatorial pacific between 2 s and 2 n 140 e 165 e and 165 e 170 w fig 5b the features of the large scale equatorial circulation are seen on both estimates that is the zonal westward flow increasing from east to west is dominated by the south equatorial current sec while the easterly trades winds lead to a meridional divergence in the ekman surface layer except at the southern side of the westernmost box due to the equatorward western boundary current the upwelling rate is deduced from the vertical velocity fields and corresponds to a tight interplay between horizontal transports though qualitatively similar the intensity of the upwelling is much higher in assimall especially in the far western pacific estimated at 1 sv in assimts and 10 sv in assimall the increased upwelling in assimall 9 sv compared to assimts compensates the changes in the meridional 6 sv and zonal 3 sv divergences in the eastern box the enhanced zonal divergence in assimall 4 in assimall compared to assimts is compensated by a reduced meridional divergence 1 sv resulting in changes of the upwelling rate of 3 sv in assimall compared to assimts the geostrophic component of the mass transport is shown in fig 5c while the zonal geostrophic component is still westward the geostrophic approximation can be used for estimating the sec picaut et al 1989 the geostrophic meridional currents are clearly equatorward the sum of horizontal geostrophic currents are thus convergent and most of the upwelling changes can be explained by a reduced meridional convergence in assimall due to geostrophy from 10 sv to 1 sv in the western box and from 35 sv to 30 sv in the eastern box the important modifications of the equatorial upwelling are thus the consequences of horizontal changes in both meridional and zonal directions and can be attributed to the pressure driven circulation geostrophic component 4 2 sea surface height and steric height since most of the modifications of the upwelling rate are related to the pressure driven circulation the mean ssh from assimall and the differences from assimts are shown in fig 6a in the northern pacific the trough around 8 n and the crest around 4 n mark the edges of the eastward north equatorial counter current while the large latitudinal extension of the trough south of 4 n indicates the position of the two branches of the westward sec johnson et al 2002 the meridional tilt of the isocontours reflects the strength of the currents and shows a maximum in the central and eastern pacific in agreement with johnson et al 2002 the main patterns of the ssh differences are the positive anomaly around 8 n the two negative lobes in the central pacific and the strong negative anomaly along the western boundary the positive anomaly at the 8 n trough combined with the negative anomaly at the 4 n crest reduce the tilt at the position of the necc that marks a decrease of the strength of the current this is confirmed by the surface current differences in fig 6b that show westward anomalies in the necc similarly the two lobes mark a reduction of the meridional tilt of the isocontours along the equator that indicates a decrease of the sec intensity in the equatorial band in the western boundary the important decrease of the ssh should result in a reduction of the equatorward western boundary currents given that the difference of the steric height at the surface relative to 300 m 0 300 sh between assimall and assimts in fig 6b shows similar patterns to that based on ssh fig 6a previous conclusions at the surface changes can be extended in subsurface note that the sh as the baroclinic component of the sea level is deduced from the density field and is integrative view of the thermohaline stratification similar patterns are seen on the difference of steric height at 100 m relative to 300 m between the two simulations in fig 6c indicating that ssh differences reflect modifications of the subsurface stratification the close relationship of the 100 m current anomalies with differences of the steric height at 100 m clearly indicates that the horizontal current differences are mainly driven by the changes of the pressure gradient additionally the equatorward western boundary circulation is significantly reduced at 3 5 s the northward mass transport in the 0 700 m layer from the western boundary to 170 e is reduced from 14 2 sv in assimts to 9 8 sv in assimall note that the mass transport at the entrance of the solomon sea is estimated at 15 sv from repeated glider transects davis et al 2012 all these modifications mainly driven by ssh changes are expected to act on the large scale circulation in modifying the mass transport from the pacific to the indian oceans through the indonesian throughflow kamenkovich et al 2003 this would require further investigations 4 3 zonal pressure gradient and the mean dynamic topography here we focus on the different features of the zonal pressure gradient several studies have shown that the zonal pressure gradient can be closely related to the zonal slope of the ssh e g nagura and mcphaden 2008 consequently in modifying the mean ssh the assimilation of altimetry by the addition of a mdt can potentially impact on the mean pressure gradient here we only consider changes of the zonal pressure gradient but similar conclusions can be made in the meridional direction the vertical structure of the mean zonal pressure gradient is presented in fig 7 lower panels in general the shape and amplitude of the zonal pressure gradient are consistent from that reported by historical studies mangum and hayes 1984 qiao and weisberg 1997 yu and mcphaden 1999 a zonal pattern is found in the two solutions with a weaker amplitude west of 170 e than in the central eastern pacific consistently with a weaker mean surface wind stress in the west yu and mcphaden 1999 in the central eastern pacific the zonal pressure gradient is clearly eastward above the thermocline with a maximum in the central pacific 5 10 7m s 2 the assimall minus assimts difference fig 7c indicates a large scale pattern with a significant negative anomaly 2 10 7 m s 2 in the western pacific and to a lesser extent in the far eastern pacific to understand the relationship of the zonal pressure gradient with the zonal gradient of ssh as identified in several studies yu and mcphaden 1999 nagura and mcphaden 2008 the zonal pressure gradient is vertically integrated in fig 7 upper panels as mentioned previously a minimum is found in the western pacific and a maximum in the central pacific looking specifically at the differences between assimall and assimts fig 7c changes of 2 10 5 m 2 s 2 in the depth integrated zonal pressure gradient in the western pacific correspond to changes of 2 10 7 m s 2 in the zonal gradient of the ssh in that region variations of the zonal pressure gradient are large yu and mcphaden 1999 and the amplitude of the assimall minus assimts difference is comparable to the magnitude of the variability occurring at seasonal to interannual time scales yu and mcphaden 1999 since an important difference between the assimts and the assimall solutions is the assimilation of the ssh anomaly provided by altimetry only assimilated in assimall a question is whether the use of a mdt to convert the model ssh in sea level anomaly sla such as s l a s s h m d t can generate large scale patterns in the zonal pressure gradient to address this question the 0 300 steric height 0 300 sh is computed from assimts and assimall temperature and salinity fields and compared with that computed from tao triton temperature combined with argo salinity fig 8a errors due to gaps in tao triton time series based on the difference between the mean 0 300 sh from the complete assimall fields and that from fields co located in time with the tao triton moorings are not significant lower than 1 cm not shown the 0 300 sh in the assimts and noassim is closer to observations than that in the assimall in the western pacific with differences reaching 7 cm at 137 e to determine if the mdt can be related with the sh discrepancy the mdt for the assimilation of altimetry in assimall is shown in fig 8 as well as the main components used in the mdt computation the observation based cnes cls13 mdt and the model mdt see hamon et al 2019 as each mdt is computed over a different period the sea level anomaly from the gridded duacs product averaged over the time period of each mdt has been removed from each estimate to remove the effects of the long term variability it shows that the zonal pattern of the cnes cls13 mdt similar to that of the latest version cnes cls18 mdt has a zonal slope that is more consistent with the slope of the tao triton 0 300 sh than the mdt used in assimall fig 8b this suggests that the cnes cls mdt is not responsible for the pattern of the mdt used in assimall the strong zonal slope of the mdt used in assimall mostly seen west of 160 e is rather due to the model mdt from the previous reanalysis glorys2v3 fig 8c see section 2 1 such mdt biases in the western pacific not sufficiently corrected during the mdt procedures hamon et al 2019 have important and problematic consequences for the physical bgc model consequently the computation of the mdt should be reevaluated with regards to these results however it is important to mention that obtaining a global accurate mdt resolving simultaneously equatorial regions high latitudes plus continental shelves are far to be straightforward and has rather to be seen as a long term process as will be shown the comparison of surface chlorophyll in the tropical pacific and nitrate concentration along the equatorial pacific shows that modified mdt strongly reduces differences from observations demonstrating that differences between assimts and assimall are mostly due to biases in the mdt 4 4 impact of altimetry assimilation with dedicated experiments as mentioned in section 2 differences between assimall and assimts are due to the assimilation of altimetry and the use of the seek filter the comparison of noalti with the control experiment allows to assess the sensitivity of the system due to the assimilation of altimetry the seek filter is used for in situ observations while the comparison with mdtpatch demonstrates the sensitivity due to the mdt in mdtpatch the modified mdt 5 cm along the equator around 165 e has been built from the sla residuals of the control run corresponding to the differences of the observed sla and the analyzed sla i e model sea surface height minus the mdt which have been bin averaged for the period june 2014 may 2015 fig 9 note that the zonal slope is strongly reduced fig 8c in fig 10a b a significant reduction of the vertical velocity 0 5 m day is seen in the western equatorial pacific on both mdtpatch and noalti experiments this is associated with a reduction of the cold bias seen in the control run 0 5 c fig 10c this supports the key role of the mdt in the mercator ocean system in triggering biases in equatorial physics note that reduction of the warm bias in the eastern pacific especially in noalti might reflect an inconsistency between satellite and in situ observations and this deserves to be further investigated later on in fig 11 bgc fields forced by the control run shows similar differences from observations than that forced with assimall fig 1 the western pacific is strongly productive with high concentration of surface chl and nitrates compared with the control run bgc fields forced by mdtpatch and noalti have smaller differences with observations demonstrating the key role of the mdt used for the assimilation procedures of altimetry in the issues seen in the tropical pacific physics and biogeochemistry in the mercator ocean system 5 interpretation of the temperature balance having revealed the mechanisms that lead to an increase in the vertical velocity in the western pacific due to the assimilation of altimetry we discuss the consequences of such modifications in terms of the heat balance in the mean the significant amplification of equatorial upwelling in the western pacific bringing cold deep waters in the surface layer raises the question of the heat balance especially with regards to the strong cold anomaly found in assimall in the western pacific around 150 m fig 4a 2 t t u x t v y t w z t a d v q n e t ρ 0 c p h h f i n c t i n c r where the angle brackets denote the depth integration over the upper 300 m adv represents the advection term hf is the net heat flux with ρ 0 the density of sea water 1025 kg m 3 and c p the heat capacity 3940 j kg c inc is the temperature increment correction to apply to the model due to data assimilation in assimts the increment is only a large scale temperature correction while in assimall the temperature increment is the weighted sum of the large scale temperature one and the small scale one coming from the multivariate seek filter the term r is a residual which includes entrainment horizontal and vertical mixing to understand the role of data assimilation on the mean heat balance the mean temperature increments averaged in the 0 300 m layer from the assimts and assimall simulations are shown in fig 12 on average data assimilation slightly cools the eastern equatorial pacific in assimts compared to assimts the mean temperature increment in assimall is much stronger and the pattern is a dipole with a significant warming west of the dateline and cooling east of it the magnitude of the warming reaches 1 c month in the far western pacific the sum of the advection and heat flux terms are shown infig 12b d while the net heat flux contribution mainly results from the atmospheric forcing the advection term is obtained by computing monthly averages of each component of term a in eq 2 from daily fields of temperature and velocity the clear correspondence between fig 12c and d but with opposite sign indicates that mean temperature increment is related with the net heat flux and advection terms while the surface heat flux is almost unchanged the contribution of advection is determinant in controlling temperature increments actually most of heat advection in assimall is due to the vertical component not shown for comparison the mean net heat flux in the niño 3 box 150 w 90 w 5 s 5 n is lower than 0 2 c mon indicating that the warming applied by data assimilation is huge with regards to the mean heat balance given the magnitude of the mean temperature increments compared to the net heat flux we now consider the long term evolution of the ocean heat content long term changes of steric height from data assimilation systems can be inconsistent with observation based estimates storto et al 2018 gasparin et al 2018 the ocean heat content ohc evolution is computed from o h c ρ 0 c p 300 m 0 t d z with t the anomaly from the 2008 2014 mean fig 13a shows the ocean heat content integrated in the tropical pacific 170 e 100 w 12 s 12 n from the scripps argo product assimts and assimall estimates while assimts is in agreement with argo 0 14 1022 j yr the ohc from assimall is two times higher 0 29 1022 j yr finally to evaluate the possibility that changing the mean heat balance might induce a spurious ocean heat gain the assimall minus assimts ohc difference only based on temperature fields is compared with ohc differences from reconstructed time series by integrating the sum of the advection net heat flux and temperature increment terms this comparison demonstrates that the modification of the mean heat balance by inconsistent mean temperature increment likely results in a higher mean local warming 6 conclusion and discussion the general framework of this study is a well known persistent problem in physical bgc models regarding an unrealistic chl surface concentration and an unrealistic accumulation of nitrates in the tropical pacific when forced by outputs from physical reanalyses given the strong sensitivity of bgc models to the physical forcing in that region the present study has assessed the consequences of physical data assimilation on the representation of the mean dynamics from a set of three sister ocean reanalysis runs that use the same physical bgc model configuration but that differ in their level of physical data assimilation based on a series of simple cause effect mechanisms it is shown that the sensitivity of the bgc model in the tropical pacific to physical data assimilation is mainly related to important differences in the intensity of the mean equatorial upwelling in the western equatorial pacific resulting from changes in the pressure field the western tropical pacific has a key role in the dynamics of the whole tropical pacific in our physical bgc model consistently with results from the seasonal forecasting system at ecmwf balmaseda and anderson 2009 based on the analysis of the nitrate budget in the equatorial euphotic layer the simulation having both levels of data assimilation assimall a 3d var large scale t s correction and a multivariate correction applied on the prognostic variables from the seek filter is mainly characterized by an unrealistic vertical advection flux of nitrates in the western pacific these nitrates are then distributed along the whole equatorial basin by the horizontal circulation nearly all the excess of nitrates is consumed through biological processes that explain the higher chl concentrations at the sea surface additionally as the vertical input of nitrates is not totally compensated by the consumption of biological processes small positive residuals cause a long term accumulation of nitrates in the tropical band moreover the analysis of the vertical velocity reveals that changes in the vertical advection flux is driven by the mean value rather than the small scale variability associated with potential assimilation shocks the signature of the enhanced upwelling in the western equatorial pacific is seen in vertical sections of the thermal stratification and currents with an upward displacement of the isolines resulting by definition from the continuity equation the changes of the vertical velocity reflect the modifications of the zonal and meridional circulations we point out that biases in the mdt required for referencing the sea level anomaly provided by altimetry have strong impacts on the tropical circulation in the whole basin in modifying the mean ssh the mdt changes the subsurface pressure field associated with the thermohaline stratification additionally these biases of the mdt lead to an unrealistic long term ocean warming in the tropical pacific in fact the vertical flux of cold water due to the increased upwelling in the western pacific induces a strong temperature increment reaching 1 c mon equivalent to five times the surface heat flux however the upwelled cold water and the warm increments are not totally balanced causing a local heat excess in the whole tropical basin the assimilation of altimetric sea level anomaly is important for representing key mechanisms for biogeochemistry in the equatorial pacific such as tropical instability waves e g gorgues et al 2005 further investigations are thus needed to refine the mdt it may be tempting to apply a correction patch based on the mean difference between altimetry and the model as done in the experiments but ocean reanalyses are based on atmospheric forcing model processes and data assimilation with errors in surface forcing and modeled processes compensated by data assimilation in constraining thermohaline stratification and ssh data assimilation modifies one of the components of this balance without significantly changing the net surface forcing wind stress heat and freshwater fluxes resulting in disturbing the initial balance however the temptation to artificially modify one of the components of the system toward keeping some theoretical balance can be counterproductive given the continuous evolution of the elements of the system several improvements of the mdt computation and of the assimilation techniques are expected to improve the general balance as the computation of the mdt combines satellites and in situ measurements its local accuracy depends on the evolution of the global ocean observing system while the advent gravimetric data have improved our knowledge of the earth s geoid castruccio et al 2008 rio et al 2013 more advanced techniques will increase the resolution of the mdt and include more accurate details of the ocean circulation knudsen et al 2019 additionally enhancing in situ measurements are also essential for refining the accuracy of the mdt rio et al 2011 while the first deployments of argo floats with argos antenna were strongly sensitive to the equatorial divergence gasparin et al 2015 recent deployments of floats equipped with iridium antenna may be of great interest although the accuracy of the mdt will progress over time this study demonstrates that error statistics of the mdt is important for operational systems as mentioned in section 2 1 the mdt and sla errors are estimated by the desroziers method at a scale of about 150 km which is consistent with altimetric information however fig 8 shows that there is larger scale bias of the order of 10 of longitude which is not considered in the current approach further work is needed to estimate the error and bias jointly rather than using the desroziers non bias hypothesis this analysis ends up pointing out the key role of the mdt during the assimilation procedures of altimetry in the mercator ocean system however it is important to mention that our conclusions do not hold in other operational systems assimilating only t s profiles with similar issues while et al 2010 park et al 2018b the question of why the issue is not seen in assimts is a reasonable one we argue that by introducing a supplementary force in the prognostic model equations the iau reduces the imbalance between the pressure gradient force and the atmospheric forcing as shown in the north atlantic due to an initial mdt bias lower than 2 cm benkiran and greiner 2008 while et al 2010 thus this study demonstrates that the iau is not sufficient in the tropical pacific where the mdt bias can reach 7 cm over more than 3000 km however we hope that our study will stimulate other careful diagnostics of the physics to help better understand the causes of the vertical velocity biases that may differ from the mercator ocean system as demonstrated here this goes through a better understanding of the physics and biogeochemistry in the equatorial pacific and in situ observations from the tropical pacific observing system tpos will strongly contribute to it several follow on aspects of tpos that are fundamental for physical bgc models are pointed out by the present study velocity measurements in the surface and subsurface layers are unique information for data assimilation systems because they are not assimilated and constitute independent data sets for assessing and improving the representation of the ocean circulation by physical models bgc measurements along the water column from argo floats are also strongly required to evaluate improve and eventually assimilate it into models while the ocean color dataset is commonly assimilated in bgc models ford et al 2018 significant work is needed for assimilating bgc floats our objective has been to quantitatively assess the capabilities of the physical bgc model in the tropical pacific and to provide some elements to the evolving design of the tpos smith et al 2019 this integrated vision from physical bgc models illustrates that the contribution of ocean observations for ocean models should thus be evaluated by its direct impact on systems evaluation and data assimilation but also by its indirect impact through the mdt that can be equivalent balmaseda and anderson 2009 finally this study demonstrates that looking into details of the physics is indispensable to improve physical data assimilation systems to better understand their relationship with bgc models and to ensure that they make the best use of oceanic observations credit authorship contribution statement florent gasparin conceptualization writing original draft sophie cravatte writing

23912,two methods for setting tides in regional numerical models focussed on replication of internal waves are discussed in this paper a traditional procedure prescribes the tidal forcing at the boundaries of the model domain as it follows from our analysis this method works well in some cases but does not allow to control identical generation conditions in all points of the model grid tidal ellipses are spatially dependent on the relative distance to the model boundaries an alternative method for activation of tidal motions in general circulation models is to set a tidal body force on the right hand side of the momentum balance equations the procedure of how to do this correctly is in the focus of the present study it is based on the analytical solution of the shallow water equations and includes compensating terms providing blockage of the generation of spurious inertial oscillations the method was tested in a wide range of input parameters and showed a good match of the model predicted tidal currents in all points of the model domain the method was verified against an analytical solution by comparing model predicted and theoretical internal wave amplitudes in case of realistic pycnocline type oceanic stratification keywords numerical models tides analytical solution internal waves 1 introduction the generation of internal waves by tides that streamline bottom topography in the stratified ocean is of great interest to the scientific community according to munk and wunsch 1998 the ocean without tides would turn into a stagnant pool of salty water the numerous measurements of internal waves in the ocean demand proper three dimensional modelling that can be used as a helping tool complementing sparse observations the question about setting tides in the models is very important for the correct interpretation of in situ collected data at present there two approaches for setting tides in the models i from the boundaries and ii as a forcing in momentum balance equations in the first approach three types of boundary conditions are applied i e fixed elevation fixed velocity or combination of both with an account of radiation conditions a 1976 their performance was investigated by carter and merrifield 2007 using the princeton ocean model pom to avoid reflection of generating internal waves from the model boundaries they used a group of areas with high viscosity often referred as sponge layers munroe and lamb 2005 ma and mandes 2011 and rainville et al 2010 also initiated tidal forcing from boundaries in modelling with pom similar method was applied by klymak et al 2016 in experiments with the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 the second method in setting tides is to include a body force into the momentum balance equations s 2003 using the mitgcm as a tool for modelling of internal tides added tidal body force to the zonal momentum balance equation the model output was validated against an analytical solution obtained in a two dimensional case for monotonously stratified fluid the comparison was focused on the estimation of integral wave characteristics such as total energy fluxes and tidal energy conversion rate without analysis of the parameters of every particular baroclinic mode later lorenzo et al 2006 considering similar problem of internal waves generated by a zonal tidal flow included also a coriolis parameter dependent body force term in the second momentum balance equations which allowed to suppress generation of spurious inertial oscillations the analytical expression of the rate at which energy is converted from barotropic tide to internal waves was provided by pétrélis and llewellyn smith 2006 in this paper we outline a new method for setting the tidal forcing in regional numerical models it is based on introducing two periodic terms in each of the momentum balance equations to control the parameters of tidal oscillations and suppress the generation of spurious inertial oscillations in all possible oceanic conditions the method is tested by comparing the amplitudes of tidally generated internal waves with the analytical solution the paper is organized as follows a general form of tidal ellipses is presented in section 2 section 3 focuses on two methods of setting the tidal forcing in a general three dimensional case the water depth is assumed variable although no baroclinic effect is considered at this stage barotropic tidal forcing the comparative analysis of both settings i e from boundaries or using the tidal body force is the key element here in section 4 we present an analytical solution for the internal modes generated by tides in the continuously stratified ocean this section includes also the validation of the body force method by considering different oceanic scenarios some wider applications of the proposed methodology are discussed in section 5 2 tidal ellipses theory predicts elliptical trajectories of water particles produced by tides in the rotating ocean the ellipse parameters i e the length of major and minor axis and the inclination angle are the functions of the tidal flow velocity components to find this relationship consider the tidal flow in the cartesian coordinate system 0 x y with x axis and y axis directed to the east and to the north respectively for each of tidal harmonics the eastward u and northward v tidal velocities are the periodical functions 1 u u 0 sin ω t ϕ u v v 0 sin ω t ϕ v here u 0 and v 0 are amplitudes ω is the tidal frequency t is the time ϕ u and ϕ v are u and v the tidal phases superposition of these two velocity components in space and time produce tidal ellipses as that shown in fig 1 the major axis a and minor axis b are expressed in terms of the tidal parameters as follows stashchuk et al 2017 a u 0 2 v 0 2 2 u 0 v 0 sin ϕ u 0 2 v 0 2 2 u 0 v 0 sin ϕ 2 b u 0 2 v 0 2 2 u 0 v 0 sin ϕ u 0 2 v 0 2 2 u 0 v 0 sin ϕ the inclination angle γ with respect to the eastward direction is 3 u 0 v 0 γ 1 2 arctan 2 u 0 v 0 cos ϕ u 0 2 v 0 2 n π n 0 if cos ϕ 0 n 1 if cos ϕ 0 u 0 v 0 γ 1 2 arctan 2 u 0 v 0 cos ϕ u 0 2 v 0 2 π 2 here the phase lag ϕ ϕ u ϕ v taking into account that the tidal ellipse parameters 2 3 depend only on the phase lag ϕ formula 1 can be simplified as follows 4 u u 0 sin ω t ϕ v v 0 sin ω t the tidal currents in numerical models can be introduced using 4 by setting the amplitudes u 0 v 0 of the eastward zonal and northward meridional tidal currents and the phase lag ϕ between them that control the axes of the tidal ellipse a b and its inclination angle γ having the relationship between tidal currents 4 and the parameters of tidal ellipses 2 3 the next question is how to introduce tidal currents into the numerical models technically there are two commonly used methods of barotropic tides initiation one of them assumes setting the periodic flow conditions 4 at the outer boundaries of the model domain the adjustable parameters u 0 v 0 and ϕ can be tuned in such a way to achieve the best fit of the model produced tidal flow with observations in all points inside the model domain however this is not always an easy task having in mind various interference conditions of two tidal components in different parts of the considered area and possible reflection from the boundaries an alternative method of tidal motion activation is to set periodical forcing terms directly in the momentum balance equations theoretically this method should provide similar generation conditions in all grid points the great advantage of such setting is it does not produce spurious boundary artefacts note although that the application of this method can be limited in shallow water areas with complex topography and islands below we consider both methods in detail focusing on their performance accuracy in the reproduction of tidal flow and possible limitations methodology wise the comparative analysis can be made using any oceanic general circulation model our choice is the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 which has a number of external users packages and allows free operation with both model settings 3 setting tides in the model in this section we compare two methods of setting tides into the numerical model without considering any baroclinic effects specifically excluding the generation of internal waves from the analysis in doing so we assume the fluid is homogeneous in this series of experiments consider a rotating basin in the cartesian coordinate system 0 x y z with the x axis and y axis directed to the east and to the north respectively and the z axis is vertically upward z 0 is the undisturbed free surface the localized bottom topography h x y in these experiments has a form of a gaussian type underwater bank 5 h x y h 0 h max exp x l 2 y l 2 where h 0 200m is the reference water depth h max 70m is the bank s height and l 20 km is the topography horizontal scale methodology wise these numerical experiments are aimed to study the establishment of tidal flows around and over the bank during ten tidal periods and to quantify the difference between two methods of tidal forcing the central part of the model grid was 1414 1414 nodes in x and y directions with 100m grid step in vertical direction the grid has 41 layers with 5m resolution in case of the stratified ocean when the generation of internal waves is considered additional 93 grid points with a telescopic increase of the horizontal resolution from 100m in the central part to 3 5km at the periphery were added to the lateral boundaries such a grid extension excludes backward reflection of internal waves during ten tidal cycles the time required internal waves to reach the boundaries the m 2 tidal harmonic is considered in this study for setting the frequency ω although the method is applicable to any other tidal constituent the velocities u 0 v 0 in 4 are assumed to be spatially variable the functions of x and y and no restriction on the latitude is applied the only condition is the requirement f ω where f is the coriolis parameter f 2 ω sin θ ω is the angular rotation rate of the earth and θ is the latitude an analytical solution for topographic generation of internal waves in the continuously stratified ocean is used in this study for the method validation this solution is linear therefore in the numerical experiments we keep all the parameters in the range of linearity assumption a quantitative measure of the contribution of the non linear effects into the process of tide topography interaction reads ϵ tidal excursion amplitude topographic length scale topographic height fluid depth it was shown by gerkema and zimmerman 1995 that the problem of tide topography interaction in a stratified fluid can be regarded as linear when this parameter is small i e ϵ 1 in our further numerical analysis we will keep all the parameters to be in this range 3 1 tidal forcing from boundaries the simplest way to initiate tides in the models is to prescribe periodical tidal motions on boundaries in the present series of experiments we set the tidal velocities 4 at the southern and western boundaries fig 2 the mitgcm solves hydrodynamics equations using the finite volume technique and requires to specify prescribed horizontal velocities at the boundaries without setting sea surface displacements note however in case two other boundaries are kept closed the tidal energy unable to escape from the model domain which results in the generation of standing waves to cope with the wave reflection from the model boundaries we use orlanski boundary conditions i 1976 at the northern and eastern boundaries they are based on the equation of a free propagation of any quantity ϑ through the boundary ϑ t c ϑ n 0 where n is the outward normal and c is the wave phase speed in case of the shallow water systems 6 c g h 1 f ω 2 a series of numerical experiments has been conducted with different forcing parameters u 0 v 0 and ϕ we start our analysis with the simplest case when the phase lag between eastward and northward velocities is equal to zero with ϕ 0 the tidal ellipse turns into a straight line presented by only major axis a see formula 3 the orientation of the line is controlled by the ratio of the velocity amplitudes u 0 and v 0 for instance by setting u 0 v 0 0 005ms 1 the expected direction of particle propagation should be 45 with respect to the x axis the experiment was designed to examine the influence of the earth rotation latitude on the resulting tidal ellipses produced by the model they are presented in fig 3 for three latitudes θ 0 30 and 60 hereafter the blue colour is used for original ellipses defined by formula 4 and the red colour illustrates the model output for better presentation all ellipses were scaled by a factor 1000 the principal conclusion that can be drawn from fig 3 is that with zero phase lag ϕ 0 the model produces tidal ellipses with the minor axis anyway instead of generation straight lines their shape and orientation strongly depend on the rotation the model produced ellipses are closer to straight lines in case without rotation left panel however with the increase of rotation the orientation of the ellipses dramatically changes compared to the original direction fig 3 also shows that the model produced tidal ellipses are sensitive to their spatial position they are different in different parts of the model domain for instance the ellipses are seen as straight lines in the central part of the domain along the diagonal at θ 0 left panel however in the top left and bottom right corners the presence of minor axes is quite apparent the difference between ellipses in the whole area increases with the increase of latitude see central panel for θ 30 and right panel for θ 60 most of the distortion takes place just over the seamount summit where model tidal ellipses have a well developed minor axis consider now the model results obtained for latitude θ 30 when the tidal lag ϕ 0 b 0 formula 3 fig 4 presents original blue and the model obtained red tidal ellipses for four values of the phase lag i e ϕ 0 π 6 π 3 π 2 the amplitudes of tidal velocities u 0 and v 0 in these experiments were taken 0 005ms 1 it is clear from fig 4 that the increase of the phase lag between the velocities at the boundaries results in a better match between red and blue ellipses they are almost identical when ϕ π 2 although the coincidence is still not perfect the considered examples reveal the fact that in a rotating ocean the model generated tidal velocities within the model domain are different from those prescribed at the boundaries the following model run explains the reason for this difference in this experiment the model is forced only from the western boundary with the velocity amplitude u 0 0 005ms 1 leaving the southern boundary unforced i e v 0 0 quite a moderate rotation was set in this experiment latitude θ 30 fig 5 shows time series of eastward in blue colour and northward in red colour velocities recorded at points 1 2 3 and 4 depicted in fig 2 as one can see from fig 5 being forced from just one western boundary the model produces also north south oscillations and thus v velocity due to the rotation important is that these newly produced northward velocities are out of phase to the eastward ones at all considered points phase shift is close to π in addition the model produced u velocity is also different from those prescribed at the western boundary its amplitude within the model domain exceed the initial value 0 005ms1 in all four points thus the tidal forcing from only western boundary generates also northward velocities v which in turn have a positive feedback to the u velocity the generation of extra v velocities by the model explains the decrease of ellipses inclination with the increase of the rotation fig 3 by setting the tidal forcing at the model boundaries one must be prepared to the generation of some extra spurious currents with spatially variable phase leg that can lead to the spatial variability of the tidal signal within the model domain 3 2 tidal forcing as a body force in momentum balance equations an alternative approach for setting tides in the ocean numerical models is to introduce a tidal body force on the right hand side rhs of the momentum balance equations below we present the idea of how the expression for body force can be found consider a system of shallow water equations for homogeneous fluid an assumption of the rigid lid at the free surface is applied the simplest way to initiate tidal velocities in the momentum balance equations using formula 1 is as follows 7 u t f v u 0 ω cos ω t ϕ u v t f u v 0 ω cos ω t ϕ v without rotation f 0 u 0 and v 0 are the amplitudes of the u and v velocities that satisfy the shallow water equations the coriolis force introduces a lateral acceleration that makes these two equations coupled to clarify the role of the rotation some conversion of 7 is required applying the cross differentiation procedure system 7 can be rewritten in the form of two equations one for u velocity only 8 u t t f 2 u f ω v 0 cos ω t ϕ v ω 2 u 0 sin ω t ϕ u first forcing second forcing and another for v velocity 9 v t t f 2 v f ω u 0 cos ω t ϕ u ω 2 v 0 sin ω t ϕ v first forcing second forcing it is seen that eqs 8 and 9 contain two forcing terms in their rhs both terms are periodic functions with the frequency ω but have different amplitudes and the phase shifts ϕ u and ϕ v applying simple trigonometrical procedures to the rhs of eqs 8 and 9 they can be converted into the following expressions ω 2 u 0 sin ω t ϕ u and ω 2 v 0 sin ω t ϕ v respectively where u 0 ϕ u u 0 and ϕ u are as follows 10 u 0 f 2 ω 2 v 0 2 u 0 2 2 f ω u 0 v 0 sin ϕ u ϕ v ϕ u arctan f ω v 0 cos ϕ v ω 2 u 0 sin ϕ u ω 2 u 0 cos ϕ u f ω v 0 sin ϕ v v 0 f 2 ω 2 u 0 2 v 0 2 2 f ω u 0 v 0 sin ϕ u ϕ v ϕ v arctan f ω u 0 cos ϕ u ω 2 v 0 sin ϕ v ω 2 v 0 cos ϕ v f ω u 0 sin ϕ u then the solutions of differential eqs 8 and 9 are 11 u t ω 2 ω 2 f 2 u 0 sin ω t ϕ u v t ω 2 ω 2 f 2 v 0 sin ω t ϕ v it is clear that velocities 11 are quite different from the expected form 1 they coincide at f 0 but the rotation introduces substantial distortion into solution 11 as a result by setting the tidal forcing according to 7 it is difficult to control the parameters of the resulting tidal ellipses moreover the velocity value enormously increases with the increase of rotation when f ω to suppress the influence of the rotation we propose to add additional terms to the tidal body force in the rhs of the momentum balance equations as shown below 12 u t f v u 0 ω cos ω t ϕ u v 0 f sin ω t ϕ v v t f u v 0 ω cos ω t ϕ v u 0 f sin ω t ϕ u with these additional terms after the routine mathematical procedure the system 12 takes the form 13 u t t f 2 u u 0 f 2 ω 2 sin ω t ϕ u v t t f 2 v v 0 f 2 ω 2 sin ω t ϕ v the solution of the system of differential eqs 13 is 14 u t u 0 sin ω t ϕ u v t v 0 sin ω t ϕ v this solution is quite simple compare with 10 and 11 in which the resulting amplitudes u 0 and v 0 of zonal and meridional currents and their phases ϕ u and ϕ v can be taken as input model parameters for tidal ellipses 1 from observations for instance note that solution 14 was found in the basin of constant depth in case of variable depth we can assume constant water discharge over varying topography which is applicable for the regional scale modelling then the tidal forcing f u and f v in the momentum balance equations for the case of variable depth h x y can be generalized as follows 15 f u u 0 x y ω cos ω t ϕ v 0 x y f sin ω t f v v 0 x y ω cos ω t u 0 x y f sin ω t ϕ here u 0 x y ψ 0 x h x y and v 0 x y ψ 0 y h x y ψ 0 x const and ψ 0 y const are the water discharges in x and y directions some further simplifications can be introduced taking into account that only the phase lag ϕ ϕ u ϕ v it was shown above matters for setting the ellipses not the absolute values of the phases ϕ u and ϕ v the examples below show how it works in real model experiments with the mitgcm fig 6 shows the scheme with the arrangement of the model forcing and boundary conditions the blue colour of the model domain means that u 0 x y and v 0 x y tidal velocities are activated in the whole area using 15 technically an extra subroutine with the defining of tidal forcing can be added to the mitgcm code using mypackage option with such a setting all boundaries should be open with zero derivatives for all variables fig 6 consider the difference between figs 2 and 6 in setting the telescopic extension of the grid near boundaries in the case with the stratified ocean one should provide a smooth telescopic grid step increase both for i surface and ii internal waves really in a stratified ocean of variable depth both long barotropic and shorter internal tidal waves are generated physical properties of these waves i e the vertical structure wavelength phase speed are quite different barotropic tidal waves are much longer and faster than generated by tides internal waves a two step telescopic grids should be provided to avoid reflection of both types of waves from the boundaries the first additional grid produces a quite gradual increase of steps that works for internal waves the second grid makes a more rapid change of the steps to provide a substantial increase of a distance that required for fast surface waves this combination of the grid stretching provides quite a long time of propagation both surface and internal waves from the generation site to the boundary within this time interval there will be no backward reflection of both types of waves this methodology works quite well for localized bottom topographies like seamounts or oceanic ridges and also in case of restricted areas of slope shelf topography the best way to illustrate the performance of an alternative method of the tidal forcing in the numerical model is to conduct similar experiments that were done with the forcing from boundaries and to compare the model results fig 7 presents the velocity time series recorded at the same four control points and parameters u 0 0 005ms1 v 0 0 θ 30 as it was in fig 5 the principal difference between the time series shown in figs 5 and 7 is that with the tidal body force 15 the model perfectly reproduces velocities that coincide with their initial presentations 14 with tidal forcing in the momentum balance equations the model does not generate spurious meridional velocities v that are visible in fig 5 moreover at all considered points the resulting zonal velocities u have the amplitudes u 0 0 005ms 1 we repeated all previous experiments using tidal body forcing 15 the model produced tidal ellipses perfectly coincided with those shown in figs 3 4 by blue colours 4 generation of internal waves by tides in stratified fluid analytical and numerical solutions two methods for settings the tidal forcing in ocean models presented above revealed inconsistency of their model outputs the better performance of the tidal body force procedure in comparison to the boundary forcing method for homogeneous water requires its further testing in case of stratified fluid when the tidal flow interacting with bottom topography generates internal waves the best way to validate a numerical model is to compare its outputs against any analytical solution in the present study we use the fourier transforms and complex analysis to derive a solution for internal waves generated by tide over an underwater ridge a three parametric buoyancy frequency profile is used in the analysis which allows a reasonably realistic smoothed oceanic pycnocline 4 1 analytic solution consider a rotating basin of variable depth

separate baroclinic modes in the model output and to compare the model predicted and analytical amplitudes of every particular mode separately the method of their separation is based on the

time t one can estimate the wave amplitude a j considering a spatial x transect of the w field from the ridge ideally without dissipation the spatial profile of the waves radiated from topography should be periodical at any distance from the source of generation having the same amplitude a j at all distances alternatively one can consider w time series at a fixed point taking the maximum value of oscillation as an amplitude 4 3 comparison of analytical and numerical solutions validation of the model settings with the tidal body force in the rhs of momentum balance equations was conducted

the analytical solution 30 is a good first guess for the model validation in the numerical model the horizontal resolution δ x 20m was small enough for replication of the generated waves and calculation of their amplitudes the method of the telescopic increase of the grid steps near the model domain boundaries described above was used in the vertical direction the grid resolution was δ z

the dots of the corresponding colour they were calculated using model time series of the vertical velocity recorded at some distance from the ridge using 37 the dependencies a j l j 1 2 3 are shown for three latitudes θ 0 30 60 it is seen from the graphs that the amplitude of the first baroclinic mode dominates over all other modes for wide ridge however for narrow ridges the amplitudes of the higher modes are larger this is the case when the topography is getting near critical in terms of the bottom inclination critical conditions d h d x α h note also that the generation efficiency decreases with the increase of rotation compare maximum amplitudes in all three graphs analysis of fig 9 shows also that the numerical model captures all properties of the analytical solution very well the coincidence of the model predicted wave amplitudes with the analytical solution is relatively good in the whole range of the bottom width and considered latitudes the largest discrepancy between the wave amplitudes does not exceed 10 4 4 setting the tidal forcing in the considered above experiments the body force terms f u and f v in the rhs of the momentum balance equations were used in the form as they stand in 15 i e including compensating terms the balanced forcing case in the present section we address the question what would be the model output in the unbalanced forcing case i e when compensating terms v 0 x y f sin ω t in f u and u 0 x y f sin ω t ϕ in f v are ignored the difference between the balanced and unbalanced forcing cases is illustrated here for the same stratification parameters as that used in the previous subsection the width of the ridge for two rotational experiments with θ 30 and θ 60 was taken in such a way that only first baroclinic mode is generated which makes our analysis simpler these two cases for l 21km latitude θ 30 and l 40km latitude θ 60 are marked in fig 9 by black circles apart from the fact that the first mode predominates in the model and analytical solutions important is that with these widths of the ridge the coincidence between numerically obtained and the analytical amplitudes is just perfect see fig 9 there was no meridional forcing in these experiments i e v 0 0 and ϕ 0 fig 10 is based on the model predicted time series recorded at a distance x p 3km from the ridge during 20 tidal periods 240 h of the model time for θ 30 the balanced and unbalanced forcing cases are given in black and magenta colours respectively applying orthogonality condition 37 to the time series of vertical velocity w we calculated a 1 cos k 1 x p σ t according to formula 38 fig 10 a it is seen that the amplitudes of vertical velocity in the unbalanced case magenta line exceed those obtained with the balanced forcing black line and the analytically derived amplitude 32 figs 10 b and c present the time series of vertically integrated horizontal velocities u t 1 h h 0 u t d z v t 1 h h 0 v t d z in fact the horizontal velocities produced by the model include both barotropic and baroclinic signals the vertical integration removes internal waves from the model output thus figs 10 b and c illustrate the difference between balanced and unbalanced cases for barotropic tidal motions the model output without rotational compensation in the body force reveal intermittency in the u t velocity signal fig 10 b with the generation of the v t velocity component fig 10 c which initially was not set in the model black horizontal line in panel c it is essential that being unbalanced the tidal forcing leads to a generation of inertial oscillations the energy spectrum in fig 10 d clearly shows their presence for low latitudes the difference between model produced w velocities in balanced and unbalanced cases can be not significant for instance this inconsistency accounts for only 25 at θ 30 latitude black and magenta lines in fig 10 a the contribution of spurious inertial oscillations to the model velocities strengthens with the increase of the latitude as an example fig 11 shows the model time series recorded near the ridge with l 40km width located at θ 60 latitude it is clear from fig 11 that unbalanced terms in the model forcing 15 at high latitude θ 60 lead to 2 5 times increase of the amplitude of vertical velocity panel a and enormously high level of the spurious inertial oscillations in the horizontal velocity time series panels b and c quantitatively this result is confirmed by the spectral level calculated from the model output the energy spectrum level of the inertial frequency can even exceed the energy level at tidal frequency fig 11 d figs 10 and 11 show that in case of unbalanced body force the numerical model produces both tidal and inertial oscillations their superposition in complex form can be presented as follows 39 u t u 1 exp ı ω t u 2 exp ı f t v t v 1 exp ı ω t v 2 exp ı f t here the amplitudes u 1 u 2 v 1 and v 2 can be both real or complex values introducing the new frequencies δ ω ω f and ω m e a n ω f 2 solution 39 can be rewritten as follows 40 u t exp ı ω m e a n t u 1 exp ı δ ω t 2 u 2 exp ı δ ω t 2 v t exp ı ω m e a n t v 1 exp ı δ ω t 2 v 2 exp ı δ ω t 2 formula 40 shows that both velocities u and v are present in the solution the high frequency carrier wave with frequency ω m e a n is modulated by a low frequency envelope wave with frequency δ ω t 2 thus in case of unbalanced body force the model does not reproduce precisely tidal ellipses the velocity vectors in the model domain exhibit variations of amplitude and phase in space and time the superposition of two waves with slightly different frequencies results in high frequency wave with modulation at the lower frequency it is clearly seen from fig 11 when the coriolis parameter f 1 2627 1 0 4 s 1 is close to the m2 tide frequency ω 1 4053 1 0 4 s 1 this superposition creates a beat envelope around the original sine wave in the previous examples the northward velocity was not activated in the body force v 0 0 to generalize the obtained results let us investigate how the forcing compensation works in three dimensions in doing so in the next series of experiments the parameters v 0 and ϕ in 15 are taken as non zero the bottom topography 16 is still two dimensional extended in the meridional direction shown as shaded area in fig 12 a although the major axis of tidal ellipses is not perpendicular to izobaths now but inclined as shown in panel a with the correct compensation of the spurious inertial oscillation in the forcing terms 14 the model should produce meridional tidal velocity identical to those set in 15 it was found that the body force method with compensation of inertial oscillations works well in three dimensions both for the homogeneous and continuously stratified fluids an example of the model application for the case of a stratified fluid is shown in figs 12 b d the input parameters for this run were u 0 v 0 0 005ms 1 ϕ π 3 l 21 km and the latitude θ 30 it was expected that for the chosen model parameters the first mode should be dominant fig 9 b this fact is confirmed also in the present case the cross ridge transect of the vertical velocity generated after ten tidal periods shows evidence of the first baroclinic mode fig 12 b as theory predicts section 4 1 its amplitude beyond the ridge was close to the theoretical value 1 2 1 0 3 ms 1 fig 12 c shows the time series of the barotropic velocities at a distance x p 3000m from the ridge the baroclinic signal was removed from the records by the vertical integration procedure discussed above blue and red curves in fig 12 c reveal perfect sinusoidal periodicity with the consistent phase lag between them no sign of spurious inertial oscillations is evident this consistency was recorded also at all points of the model grid the model predicted barotropic tidal ellipses in fig 12 d are pretty stable in the whole model domain and their shape is identical to the theoretical ellipses set by 15 and shown in fig 12 a 5 summary and conclusions two methods for setting tidal currents in numerical models aimed at replication of internal tides are considered in this paper the tpxo model predictions egbert and erofeeva 2002 can be used in both methods for setting the tidal forcing to describe the internal tide response generated over regional size domains several hundred kilometres horizontal scale tidal currents in the numerical model can be initiated in two ways a traditional method is to prescribe periodic oscillations at the domain boundaries this procedure works well in some cases although it requires controlling free radiation of the generated waves through the model boundaries which is not always granted an alternative way is to introduce a periodic body force in the rhs of the momentum balance equations such forcing initiates the tidal oscillations providing same generation conditions in all grid points the comparison of these two methods is in the focus of the present study the main conclusion from this paper is that tidal forcing from boundaries is not the best option for achieving the consistency of the wave signal in the whole area figs 3 shows some possible side effects specifically the tidal ellipses are not identical in the central part and at the periphery of the model domain the rotation introduces another uncontrolled effect it generates an additional spurious signal that is spatially variable and can completely change the tidal dynamics in the area figs 4 5 the principal outcome of our study is that using a tidal body force in the rhs of the momentum balance equations 15 is free from any side effects and provides same generation conditions in all points of the model domain we believe that the suggested method works well for regional modelling of internal tidal waves in restricted domains with horizontal scales of tens or hundreds of kilometres the generation conditions can be considered as spatially consistent however the applicability of this method to the larger oceanic scales must be reconsidered note that in this paper tidal forcing 15 was checked not only in the barotropic case it was also verified comparing the model predicted internal wave amplitudes a j 38 with the analytical solution 32 obtained for the internal waves generated in a stratified ocean a schematic diagram of the generation of the internal tides over a localized bottom topography is shown in fig 8 a realistic continuous fluid stratification 26 was used in this analysis which allowed analytical solution for internal modes the comparison analysis conducted for a wide range of the bottom topography width and latitudes from θ 0 to 60 has shown a consistency of numerical and analytical solutions fig 9 it is worth mentioning that tidal forcing 15 assumes a linear problem statement generally speaking the consistency of numerical and analytical solutions in the considered case does not necessarily assume that this method can be extended to all oceanographic conditions specifically the question remains to what extent it is good enough for setting tidal forcing when the froude number is comparable or larger than 1 a more detailed analysis for finding the answer is required however some heuristic speculations can be given considering the time variation of the tidal forcing f which is assumed to be the water discharge in the euler variables the time variations of f can be expressed as follows d f d t f t u 0 f x v 0 f y for linear applications it is formally required that f t u 0 f x v 0 f y specifying this condition in terms of the tidal discharge the following estimate can be considered 41 ω 1 h x y 2 ψ 0 x h x y x ψ 0 y h x y y this condition is normally valid for the principal part of the world ocean although it can be not obvious in some hot spots where nonlinear internal waves are generated nonlinear conditions for the generation of internal waves by tides are less evident for the analytical analysis one of the options for understanding the efficiency of the proposed method in the nonlinear applications is its comparison with observations the method of setting a periodic body force in the rhs of the momentum balance equations was validated for the variety of oceanic conditions the results are reported in stashchuk et al 2014 vlasenko et al 2013 2014 2016 and vlasenko and stashchuk 2015 for the celtic sea in stashchuk et al 2017 and stashchuk and vlasenko 2017 for the malin shelf and in vlasenko et al 2018 and stashchuk and vlasenko 2018 for the anton dohrn seamount north atlanic a general conclusion from all these studies is that the consistency was relatively good and the method can be

23912,two methods for setting tides in regional numerical models focussed on replication of internal waves are discussed in this paper a traditional procedure prescribes the tidal forcing at the boundaries of the model domain as it follows from our analysis this method works well in some cases but does not allow to control identical generation conditions in all points of the model grid tidal ellipses are spatially dependent on the relative distance to the model boundaries an alternative method for activation of tidal motions in general circulation models is to set a tidal body force on the right hand side of the momentum balance equations the procedure of how to do this correctly is in the focus of the present study it is based on the analytical solution of the shallow water equations and includes compensating terms providing blockage of the generation of spurious inertial oscillations the method was tested in a wide range of input parameters and showed a good match of the model predicted tidal currents in all points of the model domain the method was verified against an analytical solution by comparing model predicted and theoretical internal wave amplitudes in case of realistic pycnocline type oceanic stratification keywords numerical models tides analytical solution internal waves 1 introduction the generation of internal waves by tides that streamline bottom topography in the stratified ocean is of great interest to the scientific community according to munk and wunsch 1998 the ocean without tides would turn into a stagnant pool of salty water the numerous measurements of internal waves in the ocean demand proper three dimensional modelling that can be used as a helping tool complementing sparse observations the question about setting tides in the models is very important for the correct interpretation of in situ collected data at present there two approaches for setting tides in the models i from the boundaries and ii as a forcing in momentum balance equations in the first approach three types of boundary conditions are applied i e fixed elevation fixed velocity or combination of both with an account of radiation conditions a 1976 their performance was investigated by carter and merrifield 2007 using the princeton ocean model pom to avoid reflection of generating internal waves from the model boundaries they used a group of areas with high viscosity often referred as sponge layers munroe and lamb 2005 ma and mandes 2011 and rainville et al 2010 also initiated tidal forcing from boundaries in modelling with pom similar method was applied by klymak et al 2016 in experiments with the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 the second method in setting tides is to include a body force into the momentum balance equations s 2003 using the mitgcm as a tool for modelling of internal tides added tidal body force to the zonal momentum balance equation the model output was validated against an analytical solution obtained in a two dimensional case for monotonously stratified fluid the comparison was focused on the estimation of integral wave characteristics such as total energy fluxes and tidal energy conversion rate without analysis of the parameters of every particular baroclinic mode later lorenzo et al 2006 considering similar problem of internal waves generated by a zonal tidal flow included also a coriolis parameter dependent body force term in the second momentum balance equations which allowed to suppress generation of spurious inertial oscillations the analytical expression of the rate at which energy is converted from barotropic tide to internal waves was provided by pétrélis and llewellyn smith 2006 in this paper we outline a new method for setting the tidal forcing in regional numerical models it is based on introducing two periodic terms in each of the momentum balance equations to control the parameters of tidal oscillations and suppress the generation of spurious inertial oscillations in all possible oceanic conditions the method is tested by comparing the amplitudes of tidally generated internal waves with the analytical solution the paper is organized as follows a general form of tidal ellipses is presented in section 2 section 3 focuses on two methods of setting the tidal forcing in a general three dimensional case the water depth is assumed variable although no baroclinic effect is considered at this stage barotropic tidal forcing the comparative analysis of both settings i e from boundaries or using the tidal body force is the key element here in section 4 we present an analytical solution for the internal modes generated by tides in the continuously stratified ocean this section includes also the validation of the body force method by considering different oceanic scenarios some wider applications of the proposed methodology are discussed in section 5 2 tidal ellipses theory predicts elliptical trajectories of water particles produced by tides in the rotating ocean the ellipse parameters i e the length of major and minor axis and the inclination angle are the functions of the tidal flow velocity components to find this relationship consider the tidal flow in the cartesian coordinate system 0 x y with x axis and y axis directed to the east and to the north respectively for each of tidal harmonics the eastward u and northward v tidal velocities are the periodical functions 1 u u 0 sin ω t ϕ u v v 0 sin ω t ϕ v here u 0 and v 0 are amplitudes ω is the tidal frequency t is the time ϕ u and ϕ v are u and v the tidal phases superposition of these two velocity components in space and time produce tidal ellipses as that shown in fig 1 the major axis a and minor axis b are expressed in terms of the tidal parameters as follows stashchuk et al 2017 a u 0 2 v 0 2 2 u 0 v 0 sin ϕ u 0 2 v 0 2 2 u 0 v 0 sin ϕ 2 b u 0 2 v 0 2 2 u 0 v 0 sin ϕ u 0 2 v 0 2 2 u 0 v 0 sin ϕ the inclination angle γ with respect to the eastward direction is 3 u 0 v 0 γ 1 2 arctan 2 u 0 v 0 cos ϕ u 0 2 v 0 2 n π n 0 if cos ϕ 0 n 1 if cos ϕ 0 u 0 v 0 γ 1 2 arctan 2 u 0 v 0 cos ϕ u 0 2 v 0 2 π 2 here the phase lag ϕ ϕ u ϕ v taking into account that the tidal ellipse parameters 2 3 depend only on the phase lag ϕ formula 1 can be simplified as follows 4 u u 0 sin ω t ϕ v v 0 sin ω t the tidal currents in numerical models can be introduced using 4 by setting the amplitudes u 0 v 0 of the eastward zonal and northward meridional tidal currents and the phase lag ϕ between them that control the axes of the tidal ellipse a b and its inclination angle γ having the relationship between tidal currents 4 and the parameters of tidal ellipses 2 3 the next question is how to introduce tidal currents into the numerical models technically there are two commonly used methods of barotropic tides initiation one of them assumes setting the periodic flow conditions 4 at the outer boundaries of the model domain the adjustable parameters u 0 v 0 and ϕ can be tuned in such a way to achieve the best fit of the model produced tidal flow with observations in all points inside the model domain however this is not always an easy task having in mind various interference conditions of two tidal components in different parts of the considered area and possible reflection from the boundaries an alternative method of tidal motion activation is to set periodical forcing terms directly in the momentum balance equations theoretically this method should provide similar generation conditions in all grid points the great advantage of such setting is it does not produce spurious boundary artefacts note although that the application of this method can be limited in shallow water areas with complex topography and islands below we consider both methods in detail focusing on their performance accuracy in the reproduction of tidal flow and possible limitations methodology wise the comparative analysis can be made using any oceanic general circulation model our choice is the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 which has a number of external users packages and allows free operation with both model settings 3 setting tides in the model in this section we compare two methods of setting tides into the numerical model without considering any baroclinic effects specifically excluding the generation of internal waves from the analysis in doing so we assume the fluid is homogeneous in this series of experiments consider a rotating basin in the cartesian coordinate system 0 x y z with the x axis and y axis directed to the east and to the north respectively and the z axis is vertically upward z 0 is the undisturbed free surface the localized bottom topography h x y in these experiments has a form of a gaussian type underwater bank 5 h x y h 0 h max exp x l 2 y l 2 where h 0 200m is the reference water depth h max 70m is the bank s height and l 20 km is the topography horizontal scale methodology wise these numerical experiments are aimed to study the establishment of tidal flows around and over the bank during ten tidal periods and to quantify the difference between two methods of tidal forcing the central part of the model grid was 1414 1414 nodes in x and y directions with 100m grid step in vertical direction the grid has 41 layers with 5m resolution in case of the stratified ocean when the generation of internal waves is considered additional 93 grid points with a telescopic increase of the horizontal resolution from 100m in the central part to 3 5km at the periphery were added to the lateral boundaries such a grid extension excludes backward reflection of internal waves during ten tidal cycles the time required internal waves to reach the boundaries the m 2 tidal harmonic is considered in this study for setting the frequency ω although the method is applicable to any other tidal constituent the velocities u 0 v 0 in 4 are assumed to be spatially variable the functions of x and y and no restriction on the latitude is applied the only condition is the requirement f ω where f is the coriolis parameter f 2 ω sin θ ω is the angular rotation rate of the earth and θ is the latitude an analytical solution for topographic generation of internal waves in the continuously stratified ocean is used in this study for the method validation this solution is linear therefore in the numerical experiments we keep all the parameters in the range of linearity assumption a quantitative measure of the contribution of the non linear effects into the process of tide topography interaction reads ϵ tidal excursion amplitude topographic length scale topographic height fluid depth it was shown by gerkema and zimmerman 1995 that the problem of tide topography interaction in a stratified fluid can be regarded as linear when this parameter is small i e ϵ 1 in our further numerical analysis we will keep all the parameters to be in this range 3 1 tidal forcing from boundaries the simplest way to initiate tides in the models is to prescribe periodical tidal motions on boundaries in the present series of experiments we set the tidal velocities 4 at the southern and western boundaries fig 2 the mitgcm solves hydrodynamics equations using the finite volume technique and requires to specify prescribed horizontal velocities at the boundaries without setting sea surface displacements note however in case two other boundaries are kept closed the tidal energy unable to escape from the model domain which results in the generation of standing waves to cope with the wave reflection from the model boundaries we use orlanski boundary conditions i 1976 at the northern and eastern boundaries they are based on the equation of a free propagation of any quantity ϑ through the boundary ϑ t c ϑ n 0 where n is the outward normal and c is the wave phase speed in case of the shallow water systems 6 c g h 1 f ω 2 a series of numerical experiments has been conducted with different forcing parameters u 0 v 0 and ϕ we start our analysis with the simplest case when the phase lag between eastward and northward velocities is equal to zero with ϕ 0 the tidal ellipse turns into a straight line presented by only major axis a see formula 3 the orientation of the line is controlled by the ratio of the velocity amplitudes u 0 and v 0 for instance by setting u 0 v 0 0 005ms 1 the expected direction of particle propagation should be 45 with respect to the x axis the experiment was designed to examine the influence of the earth rotation latitude on the resulting tidal ellipses produced by the model they are presented in fig 3 for three latitudes θ 0 30 and 60 hereafter the blue colour is used for original ellipses defined by formula 4 and the red colour illustrates the model output for better presentation all ellipses were scaled by a factor 1000 the principal conclusion that can be drawn from fig 3 is that with zero phase lag ϕ 0 the model produces tidal ellipses with the minor axis anyway instead of generation straight lines their shape and orientation strongly depend on the rotation the model produced ellipses are closer to straight lines in case without rotation left panel however with the increase of rotation the orientation of the ellipses dramatically changes compared to the original direction fig 3 also shows that the model produced tidal ellipses are sensitive to their spatial position they are different in different parts of the model domain for instance the ellipses are seen as straight lines in the central part of the domain along the diagonal at θ 0 left panel however in the top left and bottom right corners the presence of minor axes is quite apparent the difference between ellipses in the whole area increases with the increase of latitude see central panel for θ 30 and right panel for θ 60 most of the distortion takes place just over the seamount summit where model tidal ellipses have a well developed minor axis consider now the model results obtained for latitude θ 30 when the tidal lag ϕ 0 b 0 formula 3 fig 4 presents original blue and the model obtained red tidal ellipses for four values of the phase lag i e ϕ 0 π 6 π 3 π 2 the amplitudes of tidal velocities u 0 and v 0 in these experiments were taken 0 005ms 1 it is clear from fig 4 that the increase of the phase lag between the velocities at the boundaries results in a better match between red and blue ellipses they are almost identical when ϕ π 2 although the coincidence is still not perfect the considered examples reveal the fact that in a rotating ocean the model generated tidal velocities within the model domain are different from those prescribed at the boundaries the following model run explains the reason for this difference in this experiment the model is forced only from the western boundary with the velocity amplitude u 0 0 005ms 1 leaving the southern boundary unforced i e v 0 0 quite a moderate rotation was set in this experiment latitude θ 30 fig 5 shows time series of eastward in blue colour and northward in red colour velocities recorded at points 1 2 3 and 4 depicted in fig 2 as one can see from fig 5 being forced from just one western boundary the model produces also north south oscillations and thus v velocity due to the rotation important is that these newly produced northward velocities are out of phase to the eastward ones at all considered points phase shift is close to π in addition the model produced u velocity is also different from those prescribed at the western boundary its amplitude within the model domain exceed the initial value 0 005ms1 in all four points thus the tidal forcing from only western boundary generates also northward velocities v which in turn have a positive feedback to the u velocity the generation of extra v velocities by the model explains the decrease of ellipses inclination with the increase of the rotation fig 3 by setting the tidal forcing at the model boundaries one must be prepared to the generation of some extra spurious currents with spatially variable phase leg that can lead to the spatial variability of the tidal signal within the model domain 3 2 tidal forcing as a body force in momentum balance equations an alternative approach for setting tides in the ocean numerical models is to introduce a tidal body force on the right hand side rhs of the momentum balance equations below we present the idea of how the expression for body force can be found consider a system of shallow water equations for homogeneous fluid an assumption of the rigid lid at the free surface is applied the simplest way to initiate tidal velocities in the momentum balance equations using formula 1 is as follows 7 u t f v u 0 ω cos ω t ϕ u v t f u v 0 ω cos ω t ϕ v without rotation f 0 u 0 and v 0 are the amplitudes of the u and v velocities that satisfy the shallow water equations the coriolis force introduces a lateral acceleration that makes these two equations coupled to clarify the role of the rotation some conversion of 7 is required applying the cross differentiation procedure system 7 can be rewritten in the form of two equations one for u velocity only 8 u t t f 2 u f ω v 0 cos ω t ϕ v ω 2 u 0 sin ω t ϕ u first forcing second forcing and another for v velocity 9 v t t f 2 v f ω u 0 cos ω t ϕ u ω 2 v 0 sin ω t ϕ v first forcing second forcing it is seen that eqs 8 and 9 contain two forcing terms in their rhs both terms are periodic functions with the frequency ω but have different amplitudes and the phase shifts ϕ u and ϕ v applying simple trigonometrical procedures to the rhs of eqs 8 and 9 they can be converted into the following expressions ω 2 u 0 sin ω t ϕ u and ω 2 v 0 sin ω t ϕ v respectively where u 0 ϕ u u 0 and ϕ u are as follows 10 u 0 f 2 ω 2 v 0 2 u 0 2 2 f ω u 0 v 0 sin ϕ u ϕ v ϕ u arctan f ω v 0 cos ϕ v ω 2 u 0 sin ϕ u ω 2 u 0 cos ϕ u f ω v 0 sin ϕ v v 0 f 2 ω 2 u 0 2 v 0 2 2 f ω u 0 v 0 sin ϕ u ϕ v ϕ v arctan f ω u 0 cos ϕ u ω 2 v 0 sin ϕ v ω 2 v 0 cos ϕ v f ω u 0 sin ϕ u then the solutions of differential eqs 8 and 9 are 11 u t ω 2 ω 2 f 2 u 0 sin ω t ϕ u v t ω 2 ω 2 f 2 v 0 sin ω t ϕ v it is clear that velocities 11 are quite different from the expected form 1 they coincide at f 0 but the rotation introduces substantial distortion into solution 11 as a result by setting the tidal forcing according to 7 it is difficult to control the parameters of the resulting tidal ellipses moreover the velocity value enormously increases with the increase of rotation when f ω to suppress the influence of the rotation we propose to add additional terms to the tidal body force in the rhs of the momentum balance equations as shown below 12 u t f v u 0 ω cos ω t ϕ u v 0 f sin ω t ϕ v v t f u v 0 ω cos ω t ϕ v u 0 f sin ω t ϕ u with these additional terms after the routine mathematical procedure the system 12 takes the form 13 u t t f 2 u u 0 f 2 ω 2 sin ω t ϕ u v t t f 2 v v 0 f 2 ω 2 sin ω t ϕ v the solution of the system of differential eqs 13 is 14 u t u 0 sin ω t ϕ u v t v 0 sin ω t ϕ v this solution is quite simple compare with 10 and 11 in which the resulting amplitudes u 0 and v 0 of zonal and meridional currents and their phases ϕ u and ϕ v can be taken as input model parameters for tidal ellipses 1 from observations for instance note that solution 14 was found in the basin of constant depth in case of variable depth we can assume constant water discharge over varying topography which is applicable for the regional scale modelling then the tidal forcing f u and f v in the momentum balance equations for the case of variable depth h x y can be generalized as follows 15 f u u 0 x y ω cos ω t ϕ v 0 x y f sin ω t f v v 0 x y ω cos ω t u 0 x y f sin ω t ϕ here u 0 x y ψ 0 x h x y and v 0 x y ψ 0 y h x y ψ 0 x const and ψ 0 y const are the water discharges in x and y directions some further simplifications can be introduced taking into account that only the phase lag ϕ ϕ u ϕ v it was shown above matters for setting the ellipses not the absolute values of the phases ϕ u and ϕ v the examples below show how it works in real model experiments with the mitgcm fig 6 shows the scheme with the arrangement of the model forcing and boundary conditions the blue colour of the model domain means that u 0 x y and v 0 x y tidal velocities are activated in the whole area using 15 technically an extra subroutine with the defining of tidal forcing can be added to the mitgcm code using mypackage option with such a setting all boundaries should be open with zero derivatives for all variables fig 6 consider the difference between figs 2 and 6 in setting the telescopic extension of the grid near boundaries in the case with the stratified ocean one should provide a smooth telescopic grid step increase both for i surface and ii internal waves really in a stratified ocean of variable depth both long barotropic and shorter internal tidal waves are generated physical properties of these waves i e the vertical structure wavelength phase speed are quite different barotropic tidal waves are much longer and faster than generated by tides internal waves a two step telescopic grids should be provided to avoid reflection of both types of waves from the boundaries the first additional grid produces a quite gradual increase of steps that works for internal waves the second grid makes a more rapid change of the steps to provide a substantial increase of a distance that required for fast surface waves this combination of the grid stretching provides quite a long time of propagation both surface and internal waves from the generation site to the boundary within this time interval there will be no backward reflection of both types of waves this methodology works quite well for localized bottom topographies like seamounts or oceanic ridges and also in case of restricted areas of slope shelf topography the best way to illustrate the performance of an alternative method of the tidal forcing in the numerical model is to conduct similar experiments that were done with the forcing from boundaries and to compare the model results fig 7 presents the velocity time series recorded at the same four control points and parameters u 0 0 005ms1 v 0 0 θ 30 as it was in fig 5 the principal difference between the time series shown in figs 5 and 7 is that with the tidal body force 15 the model perfectly reproduces velocities that coincide with their initial presentations 14 with tidal forcing in the momentum balance equations the model does not generate spurious meridional velocities v that are visible in fig 5 moreover at all considered points the resulting zonal velocities u have the amplitudes u 0 0 005ms 1 we repeated all previous experiments using tidal body forcing 15 the model produced tidal ellipses perfectly coincided with those shown in figs 3 4 by blue colours 4 generation of internal waves by tides in stratified fluid analytical and numerical solutions two methods for settings the tidal forcing in ocean models presented above revealed inconsistency of their model outputs the better performance of the tidal body force procedure in comparison to the boundary forcing method for homogeneous water requires its further testing in case of stratified fluid when the tidal flow interacting with bottom topography generates internal waves the best way to validate a numerical model is to compare its outputs against any analytical solution in the present study we use the fourier transforms and complex analysis to derive a solution for internal waves generated by tide over an underwater ridge a

particular internal mode 32 note that the model predicted vertical velocity w field is a superposition of all generated internal modes i e w j 1 w j for the comparison analysis it is necessary to separate baroclinic modes in the model output and to compare the model predicted and analytical amplitudes of every particular mode separately the method of their separation is based on the orthogonality property of baroclinic modes the mathematical procedure of the amplitude calculation is briefly outlined below in terms of vertical velocity w the wave equation describing internal waves in three dimensions x y z reads 33 2 t 2 2 w f 2 2 w z 2 n 2 z 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 0 in a two dimensional case considered here the y direction is ignored and the periodic internal waves radiated from the ridge can be presented as follows 34 w x z t w z exp ı k x ω t substitution 34 into 33 results in ordinary differential equation for w 35 2 w z 2 k 2 n 2 z ω 2 ω 2 f 2 w 0 for internal waves the rigid

amplitudes of j mode propagating in both directions from the ridge and k j is the wave number of j th mode the orthogonality condition for internal modes reads 37 h 0 n 2 z ω 2 ω 2 f 2 w n z w l z d z 0 if n l multiplying 36 by n 2 z ω 2 ω 2 f 2 w j z and applying integration from the surface to the bottom with orthogonality condition 37 we have 38 a j exp ı k j x σ t h 0 n 2 z ω 2 ω 2 f 2 w x z t w j z d z h 0 n 2 z ω 2 ω 2 f 2 w j 2 z d z from this formula two methods for the definition of the wave amplitude a j are evident having a spatial distribution of the velocity w at a fixed moment of time t one can estimate the wave amplitude a j considering a spatial x transect of the w field from the ridge ideally without dissipation the spatial profile of the waves radiated from topography should be periodical at any distance from the source of generation having the same amplitude a j at all distances alternatively one can consider w time series at a fixed point taking the maximum value of oscillation as an amplitude 4 3 comparison of analytical and numerical solutions validation of the model settings with the tidal body force in the rhs of momentum balance equations was conducted for the following stratification parameters h p 30m δ h p 50 m and n p 0 02 s 1 fig 8 the bottom topography is the ridge specified by 16 with the height h max 70m in a basin with a total water depth h 0 200m the half width of the ridge l in the experiments varies from 2km to 65km depending on the latitude θ 0 30 60 for the considered model setting the parameter ϵ 0 0 043 is really small ϵ 0 1 so the analytical solution 30 is a good first guess for the model validation in the numerical model the horizontal resolution δ x 20m was small enough for replication of the generated waves and calculation of their amplitudes the method of the telescopic increase of the grid steps near the model domain boundaries described above was used in the vertical direction the grid resolution was δ z 1 m the amplitude of the water discharge ψ 0 in x and y directions was ψ 0 x 1m 2 s 1 u 0 x ψ 0 x h x and ψ 0 y 0 thus v 0 0 and there was no phase lag ϕ in 12 ϕ 0 theory predicts that the generation mechanism of internal waves by a tidal flow over the ridge 16 has a resonance nature really the analytical solution for the amplitudes of the generated internal modes 31 32 includes the following periodical term sin k j l k j l 2 π 2 it predicts zero j mode wave amplitude when k j l n π for n 2 3 however the amplitude of j th generated mode is maximal for n 1 when l π k j because lim k j l π sin k j l k j l 2 π 2 1 fig 9 shows the analytical dependence of the wave amplitude on the ridge width for the first three baroclinic modes 32 solid lines and the model predicted values presented by the dots of the corresponding colour they were calculated using model time series of the vertical velocity recorded at some distance from the ridge using 37 the dependencies a j l j 1 2 3 are shown for three latitudes θ 0 30 60 it is seen from the graphs that the amplitude of the first baroclinic mode dominates over all other modes for wide ridge however for narrow ridges the amplitudes of the higher modes are larger this is the case when the topography is getting near critical in terms of the bottom inclination critical conditions d h d x α h note also that the generation efficiency decreases with the increase of rotation compare maximum amplitudes in all three graphs analysis of fig 9 shows also that the numerical model captures all properties of the analytical solution very well the coincidence of the model predicted wave amplitudes with the analytical solution is relatively good in the whole range of the bottom width and considered latitudes the largest discrepancy between the wave amplitudes does not exceed 10 4 4 setting the tidal forcing in the considered above experiments the body force terms f u and f v in the rhs of the momentum balance equations were used in the form as they stand in 15 i e including compensating terms the balanced forcing case in the present section we address the question what would be the model output in the unbalanced forcing case i e when compensating terms v 0 x y f sin ω t in f u and u 0 x y f sin ω t ϕ in f v are ignored the difference between the balanced and unbalanced forcing cases is illustrated here for the same stratification parameters as that used in the previous subsection the width of the ridge for two rotational experiments with θ 30 and θ 60 was taken in such a way that only first baroclinic mode is generated which makes our analysis simpler these two cases for l 21km latitude θ 30 and l 40km latitude θ 60 are marked in fig 9 by black circles apart from the fact that the first mode predominates in the model and analytical solutions important is that with these widths of the ridge the coincidence between numerically obtained and the analytical amplitudes is just perfect see fig 9 there was no meridional forcing in these experiments i e v 0 0 and ϕ 0 fig 10 is based on the model predicted time series recorded at a distance x p 3km from the ridge during 20 tidal periods 240 h of the model time for θ 30 the balanced and unbalanced forcing cases are given in black and magenta colours respectively applying orthogonality condition 37 to the time series of vertical velocity w we calculated a 1 cos k 1 x p σ t according to formula 38 fig 10 a it is seen that the amplitudes of vertical velocity in the unbalanced case magenta line exceed those obtained with the balanced forcing black line and the analytically derived amplitude 32 figs 10 b and c present the time series of vertically integrated horizontal velocities u t 1 h h 0 u t d z v t 1 h h 0 v t d z in fact the horizontal velocities produced by the model include both barotropic and baroclinic signals the vertical integration removes internal waves from the model output thus figs 10 b and c illustrate the difference between balanced and unbalanced cases for barotropic tidal motions the model output without rotational compensation in the body force reveal intermittency in the u t velocity signal fig 10 b with the generation of the v t velocity component fig 10 c which initially was not set in the model black horizontal line in panel c it is essential that being unbalanced the tidal forcing leads to a generation of inertial oscillations the energy spectrum in fig 10 d clearly shows their presence for low latitudes the difference between model produced w velocities in balanced and unbalanced cases can be not significant for instance this inconsistency accounts for only 25 at θ 30 latitude black and magenta lines in fig 10 a the contribution of spurious inertial oscillations to the model velocities strengthens with the increase of the latitude as an example fig 11 shows the model time series recorded near the ridge with l 40km width located at θ 60 latitude it is clear from fig 11 that unbalanced terms in the model forcing 15 at high latitude θ 60 lead to 2 5 times increase of the amplitude of vertical velocity panel a and enormously high level of the spurious inertial oscillations in the horizontal velocity time series panels b and c quantitatively this result is confirmed by the spectral level calculated from the model output the energy spectrum level of the inertial frequency can even exceed the energy level at tidal frequency fig 11 d figs 10 and 11 show that in case of unbalanced body force the numerical model produces both tidal and inertial oscillations their superposition in complex form can be presented as follows 39 u t u 1 exp ı ω t u 2 exp ı f t v t v 1 exp ı ω t v 2 exp ı f t here the amplitudes u 1 u 2 v 1 and v 2 can be both real or complex values introducing the new frequencies δ ω ω f and ω m e a n ω f 2 solution 39 can be rewritten as follows 40 u t exp ı ω m e a n t u 1 exp ı δ ω t 2 u 2 exp ı δ ω t 2 v t exp ı ω m e a n t v 1 exp ı δ ω t 2 v 2 exp ı δ ω t 2 formula 40 shows that both velocities u and v are present in the solution the high frequency carrier wave with frequency ω m e a n is modulated by a low frequency envelope wave with frequency δ ω t 2 thus in case of unbalanced body force the model does not reproduce precisely tidal ellipses the velocity vectors in the model domain exhibit variations of amplitude and phase in space and time the superposition of two waves with slightly different frequencies results in high frequency wave with modulation at the lower frequency it is clearly seen from fig 11 when the coriolis parameter f 1 2627 1 0 4 s 1 is close to the m2 tide frequency ω 1 4053 1 0 4 s 1 this superposition creates a beat envelope around the original sine wave in the previous examples the northward velocity was not activated in the body force v 0 0 to generalize the obtained results let us investigate how the forcing compensation works in three dimensions in doing so in the next series of experiments the parameters v 0 and ϕ in 15 are taken as non zero the bottom topography 16 is still two dimensional extended in the meridional direction shown as shaded area in fig 12 a although the major axis of tidal ellipses is not perpendicular to izobaths now but inclined as shown in panel a with the correct compensation of the spurious inertial oscillation in the forcing terms 14 the model should produce meridional tidal velocity identical to those set in 15 it was found that the body force method with compensation of inertial oscillations works well in three dimensions both for the homogeneous and continuously stratified fluids an example of the model application for the case of a stratified fluid is shown in figs 12 b d the input parameters for this run were u 0 v 0 0 005ms 1 ϕ π 3 l 21 km and the latitude θ 30 it was expected that for the chosen model parameters the first mode should be dominant fig 9 b this fact is confirmed also in the present case the cross ridge transect of the vertical velocity generated after ten tidal periods shows evidence of the first baroclinic mode fig 12 b as theory predicts section 4 1 its amplitude beyond the ridge was close to the theoretical value 1 2 1 0 3 ms 1 fig 12 c shows the time series of the barotropic velocities at a distance x p 3000m from the ridge the baroclinic signal was removed from the records by the vertical integration procedure discussed above blue and red curves in fig 12 c reveal perfect sinusoidal periodicity with the consistent phase lag between them no sign of spurious inertial oscillations is evident this consistency was recorded also at all points of the model grid the model predicted barotropic tidal ellipses in fig 12 d are pretty stable in the whole model domain and their shape is identical to the theoretical ellipses set by 15 and shown in fig 12 a 5 summary and conclusions two methods for setting tidal currents in numerical models aimed at replication of internal tides are considered in this paper the tpxo model predictions egbert and erofeeva 2002 can be used in both methods for setting the tidal forcing to describe the internal tide response generated over regional size domains several hundred kilometres horizontal scale tidal currents in the numerical model can be initiated in two ways a traditional method is to prescribe periodic oscillations at the domain boundaries this procedure works well in some cases although it requires controlling free radiation of the generated waves through the model boundaries which is not always granted an alternative way is to introduce a periodic body force in the rhs of the momentum balance equations such forcing initiates the tidal oscillations providing same generation conditions in all grid points the comparison of these two methods is in the focus of the present study the main conclusion from this paper is that tidal forcing from boundaries is not the best option for achieving the consistency of the wave signal in the whole area figs 3 shows some possible side effects specifically the tidal ellipses are not identical in the central part and at the periphery of the model domain the rotation introduces another uncontrolled effect it generates an additional spurious signal that is spatially variable and can completely change the tidal dynamics in the area figs 4 5 the principal outcome of our study is that using a tidal body force in the rhs of the momentum balance equations 15 is free from any side effects and provides same generation conditions in all points of the model domain we believe that the suggested method works well for regional modelling of internal tidal waves in restricted domains with horizontal scales of tens or hundreds of kilometres the generation conditions can be considered as spatially consistent however the applicability of this method to the larger oceanic scales must be reconsidered note that in this paper tidal forcing 15 was checked not only in the barotropic case it was also verified comparing the model predicted internal wave amplitudes a j 38 with the analytical solution 32 obtained for the internal waves generated in a stratified ocean a schematic diagram of the generation of the internal tides over a localized bottom topography is shown in fig 8 a realistic continuous fluid stratification 26 was used in this analysis which allowed analytical solution for internal modes the comparison analysis conducted for a wide range of the bottom topography width and latitudes from θ 0 to 60 has shown a consistency of numerical and analytical solutions fig 9 it is worth mentioning that tidal forcing 15 assumes a linear problem statement generally speaking the consistency of numerical and analytical solutions in the considered case does not necessarily assume that this method can be extended to all oceanographic conditions specifically the question remains to what extent it is good enough for setting tidal forcing when the froude number is comparable or larger than 1 a more detailed analysis for finding the answer is required however some heuristic speculations can be given considering the time variation of the tidal forcing f which is assumed to be the water discharge in the euler variables the time variations of f can be expressed as follows d f d t f t u 0 f x v 0 f y for linear applications it is formally required that f t u 0 f x v 0 f y specifying this condition in terms of the tidal discharge the following estimate can be considered 41 ω 1 h x y 2 ψ 0 x h x y x ψ 0 y h x y y this condition is normally valid for the principal part of the world ocean although it can be not obvious in some hot spots where nonlinear internal waves are generated nonlinear conditions for the generation of internal waves by tides are less evident for the analytical analysis one of the options for understanding the efficiency of the proposed method in the nonlinear applications is its comparison with observations the method of setting a periodic body force in the rhs of the momentum balance equations was validated for the variety of oceanic conditions the results are reported in stashchuk et al 2014 vlasenko et al 2013 2014 2016 and vlasenko and stashchuk 2015 for the celtic sea in stashchuk et al 2017 and stashchuk and vlasenko 2017 for the malin shelf and in vlasenko et al 2018 and stashchuk and vlasenko 2018 for the anton dohrn seamount north atlanic a general conclusion from all these studies is that the consistency was relatively good and the method can be

23913,we describe a numerical treatment for a two layer coupled model developed for the investigation of submarine landslides and resulting tsunami generation over irregular bathymetry the landslide model is formulated in a cartesian coordinate system oriented with the still water level in order to facilitate coupling between water and ground motions motions in the upper water layer are simulated using the 3d non hydrostatic wave model nhwave governing equations for the lower layer landslide are integrated over the slide thickness and include options for choosing either newtonian viscous or granular rheology closures the lower layer equations retain the effects of non hydrostatic pressure allowing the model to simulate motions over arbitrary and locally steep bathymetry the model equations are solved using a runge kutta scheme for time integration and a godunov type finite volume scheme for spatial derivatives with non conservative terms formulated using a finite difference scheme the resulting model is verified in comparison to two laboratory experiments involving granular slide motion and compared to observations for a field event during the 1964 alaska earthquake keywords submarine landslide two layer non hydrostatic model tsunami propagation well balanced finite volume method 1 introduction in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 hereafter referred to as z21a we have described a new two layer coupled model for simulating the motion of submarine mass failures smf and generating tsunami waves over irregular bathymetry upper layer tsunami wave generation and propagation is simulated by a three dimensional non hydrostatic wave model nhwave ma et al 2012 the lower layer smf is modeled using a depth integrated model employing either viscous or granular flow rheologies the model includes the effect of non hydrostatic pressure which allows for the description of vertical acceleration of slide within the framework of a horizontally oriented coordinate system z21a demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of these modifications to the governing equations in comparison to the analytic dam break solution of mangeney et al 2000 and to computations in slope oriented coordinates ma et al 2015 the reader is referred to z21a for a description of the context for these developments and the examination of their effectiveness here we recast the lower layer equations in a consistent form for both viscous and granular flows and describe their mathematical properties the numerical discretization techniques and model validation against experimental data and field observations the classical shallow water equations for an inviscid fluid can be written as hyperbolic conservation laws and solved effectively by finite volume methods of the godunov type with appropriate riemann solvers toro 2001 leveque 2002 when simulating landslides using this approach previous researchers have generally treated the landslides as mixture of solid and fluid phases and the presence of the solid phase and the interaction effects were embodied in the mixture stress iverson and denlinger 2001 iverson and george 2014 ma et al 2015 mathematically employing different rheology closures in shallow water type landslide models can change the eigenstructure of the equations and cause the loss of the hyperbolicity due to the appearance of complex eigenvalues in particular flow regimes the majority of previous models of this type have been proven to be hyperbolic and the riemann technique commonly used for a hyperbolic pde system can be readily applied denlinger and iverson 2001 demonstrated that the conventional savage and hutter 1989 type granular flow model was fully hyperbolic because the jacobian matrices of the model had real eigenvalues george and iverson 2014 further established hyperbolicity for their more complex model equations incorporating dilatancy effects in this paper we show that the model introduced in z21a with new algorithms for the rheology closure preserves hyperbolicity the paper is organized as follows in section 2 a consistent and conservative form of the governing equations for both granular flow and newtonian viscous flow is given and the parameters for different rheology closures are discussed criteria for maintaining the hyperbolic structure of the equations are established section 3 describes the numerical treatments of the lower layer landslide model section 4 compares the model to several laboratory results and field observations and examines model sensitivity to choices of parameters conclusions and future model improvements are discussed in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations for the landslide the lower layer landslide model describes either a mud flow by a single fluid flow with an increased viscosity and density or a granular flow by a two phase flow mixture with coulomb friction rheology the governing equations are derived in cartesian coordinates with x and y orthogonal and tangent to the still water level and z directed upward fig 1 equations 2 13 2 20 in z21a are written in semi conservative form with both horizontal components expressed as

z21a a dispersion correction s d c and a portion of stress terms s τ α l from the rheology closures the term s τ α l and the remaining portions of the stress terms s τ depend on the choice of rheology closure as described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 the coefficient n indicates the non hydrostatic model if n 1 and the hydrostatic model if n 0 the dispersion correction s d c 1 3 h β h s β g is

equations 2 10 and 2 11 in z21a and depth integrated mass conservation see equation 2 13 in z21a and we approximate horizontal velocity components at surface and bottom by their depth averaged counterparts 2 2 rheology closures eq 2 1 gives a consistent form of the governing equations for both viscous and granular flow models these two models are distinguished by different rheology closures and embodied by the different expressions of s τ α l in c α and s τ in source terms section 3 in z21a gives theoretical descriptions of these two types of slide rheology this section describes their numerical treatments by specifying s τ α l and s τ for each corresponding rheology 2 2 1 newtonian viscous flow model for the case of newtonian viscous flow the stress term s τ α l in the flux

granular flow model two sets of solid stresses are used in the granular flow model the first one is the deviatoric solid stresses used in governing equation and the second one is the solid effective stresses following the definition of soil mechanics their relation is 2 9 t e t s i p s where p s ϕ ρ s g d q s is the total pressure from solid phase and q s is non hydrostatic pressure contributed by the solid phase the solid effective stresses are estimated from the z momentum equation 3 18 in z21a this equation can be simplified by assuming that vertical normal solid stress is dominant and by having momentum correction coefficients γ z x γ z y 1 corresponding to weak vertical variations of horizontal velocity components within the slide after which the equation may be rewritten as 2 10 τ e

ρ d to avoid negative values of the total pressure p s of the solid phase at the bed the range of q s is set to be ϕ ρ s g d ϕ ρ s g d the lower bound corresponds to the status that the grains do not push each other loss of gravity where the intergranular pressure which is transmitted through grain to grain at the contact points is vanished the negative p s is not realistic since the grains are solid and do not draw each other the upper bound is an ad hoc limit letting the value falls in a range symmetric about zero non hydrostatic pressure of the solid phase 2 3 hyperbolicity of the governing equations to find the characteristics of the equations a simplified one dimensional problem is considered 2 17 e t f x s τ s p u s p l where e d u d w d t and f u d γ x x u u d c x d 2 2 γ x

subscripts l r and m represent the left right and middle characteristic field respectively to guarantee the hyperbolicity of the system we have to ensure that the argument of the square root in λ l r is 0 a sufficient condition for this is that γ x x 1 and c x 0 non negativity of the flux coefficients will be proved in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 2 3 1 newtonian viscous flow model for the hydrostatic model c α g is always positive and hyperbolicity is guaranteed as γ x x is always 1 for the non hydrostatic model the range of s d c is artificially set to g g to ensure hyperbolicity of the system under this assumption an ad hoc limit of h β h s β 3 is applied to the bathymetry for a 2d open channel flow where the slide surface is parallel to the bed the maximum slope angle can be up to 60 to ensure s d c in the range of g g 2 3 2 granular flow model for the case of granular flow we examine eqs 2 13 and 2 14 for c α term by term the first term in c α is non negative as long as c x x c z z 0 and c y y c z z 0 we rewrite the expression for c z z in equation c 9 of z21a as 2 20 c z z c 33 c 13 tan ϕ b e d 2 c 13 2 k x a c t p a s tan 2 ϕ b e d c 23 2 k y a c t p a s x a c t p a s where c z z is non negative whenever k x a c t p a s tan 2 ϕ b e d the same conclusion is true for c x x and c y y fig 2 shows a shaded region where k x a c t p a s tan 2 ϕ b e d we find that in all cases where the mohr circle law is applicable i e ϕ i n t ϕ b e d the hyperbolicity is guaranteed the second term in c α is non negative as the expression of the mixture density ρ ρ s ϕ ρ f 1 ϕ leads to 1 ϕ ρ s ρ 0 in the non hydrostatic model where n 1 including the third and the last terms may cause the loss of hyperbolicity in certain extreme cases in certain locations where c x x c z z 0 1 a large value of the non hydrostatic pressure q s ρ g d 1 c x x c z z ϕ ρ s g d could make c α 0 this may only happen when bed slope is quite small i e c x x c z z is small for example when the bed is flat c x x c z z 0 q s has to be smaller than 1 ϕ ρ f g d i e hydrostatic pressure from pore fluid when slope is mild however the non hydrostatic pressure in a shallow water type model that accounts for the vertical acceleration is small and most likely in the range where hyperbolicity is guaranteed a locally large value of s d c g could also lead to c α 0 but it only happens when very steep slopes included as we discussed in section 2 3 1 in such cases c α is artificially set to zero to ensure the system hyperbolicity 3 numerical methods the landslide model is developed here both with and without non hydrostatic pressure corrections in the hydrostatic model the governing equation 2 1 is solved using a finite volume tvd scheme in space and a runge kutta scheme in time for the non hydrostatic model a two step projection method is used for the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic components of the governing equations in the first step the governing equations with the coefficient n 1 but without non hydrostatic pressure are solved using the same approach as for the hydrostatic model then the non hydrostatic pressure correction is determined by solving a poisson equation and u v and w are updated accordingly the fortran 95 code is parallelized using openmpi https www open mpi org and the linear system resulting from the poisson equation is solved using hypre http www llnl gov casc hypre we employ the wetting drying treatment in nhwave ma et al 2012 for horizontal moving boundaries 3 1 time integration integration of the equations in time is carried out using the second order nonlinear strong stability preserving runge kutta scheme introduced by gottlieb et al 2001 the first stage of the second order runge kutta algorithm is 3 1 e 1 e n δ t f x g y n s τ n s p u n s

value of conserved variable with eqs 3 1 3 3 a two step projection method is then necessary to obtain the solution at the n 1 time level with non hydrostatic pressure as 3 4 e n 1 e δ t s q the time step δ t is allowed to vary in time and is controlled by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion 3 5 δ t c f l min min δ x u i j c x d i j min δ y v i j c y d i j where c f l is the courant number which is set to 0 5 throughout simulations to ensure stability of the computations this numerical scheme is different from the approach used for the upper layer wave model nhwave where the two step projection method is applied in each runge kutta stage in a one layer model with the strategy of nhwave even if in each intermediate runge kutta stage the velocity is divergence free the updated final velocity calculated under this structure may still violate the divergence free condition for example after the second step of the projection method in the first stage of the second order runge kutta algorithm 3 6 u 1 x v 1 y w t 1 w b 1 d 1 0 and after the second step of the projection method in the second stage of the second order runge kutta algorithm 3 7 u 2 x v 2 y w t 2 w b 2 d 2 0 the

d 2 0 using the time integration algorithm from eq 3 1 3 4 can avoid this divergence free violation 3 2 spatial discretization eqs 3 1 and 3 2 are discretized using a godunov type finite volume method leveque 2002 based on a hll riemann solver toro 2001 and a second order reconstruction operator the pvm hll method introduced by castro díaz and fernández nieto 2012 is used combined with a muscl reconstruction method pvm polynomial viscosity matrix can be seen as a generalization of many well known solvers e g lax friedrichs force gforce and hll toro 2013 with well balanced numerical schemes this method is adopted in our model because of its well balanced property escalante et al 2018 the well balanced property of our model is demonstrated in appendix b where appendix b 1 shows the analytical solutions and appendix b 2 shows the numerical test results eq 2 17 is discretized as 3 9 e i n 1 e i n δ t δ x f i 1 2 hll f i 1 2 hll δ t δ x s p l i 1 2 s p l i 1 2 δ t s t i s b i s τ i s p u i where f hll is the flux at the cell interface calculated by hll riemann solver of which the implementations are same to the ones in nhwave ma et al 2012 2015 to achieve second order spatial accuracy the conservative variables on the left and right sides of cell faces are reconstructed from cell center data by the muscl reconstruction method with minmod limiter the variables of bed surface at cell interfaces are h s i 1 2 l d i 1 2 l h i 1 2 l and h s i 1 2 r d i 1 2 r h i 1 2 r hll riemann solver is employed to approach the wave speed s l and s r at cell faces and the flux f hll can be written as 3 10 f hll e l e r 1 2 1 α 1 f e l 1 2 1 α 1 f e r 1 2 α 0 e r e l where 3 11 α 0 s r s l s l s r s r s l α 1 s r s l s r s l the dispersion correction s d c in fluxes f e l and

by a central difference scheme in this model the pvm method is used to avoid source term causing numerical instability instead of the surface gradient method sgm zhou et al 2001 used in nhwave we found that when bed slope is large sgm may lead to negative depth as demonstrated next in sgm the cell face value of slide depth is obtained by d i 1 2 l h s i 1 2 h i 1 2 l and d i 1 2 r h s i 1 2 h i 1 2 r where h s i 1 2 is discretized by a central difference scheme and h i 1 2 l r is reconstructed by the muscl reconstruction method in certain cases δ h i in the expression of h i 1 2 l can be 3 14 δ h i avg h i 1 h i δ x h i h i 1 δ x 0 since 3 15 h s i 1 2 h s i 1 2 δ x h s i 1 h s i δ x we have 3 16 d i 1 2 l h s i 1 2 h i 1 2 l d i 1 2 h s i 1 h s i when the bed slope is so large that h s i h s i 1 2 d i the slide depth at the cell center d i 1 2 l is negative 3 3 numerical treatment for cessation of granular flow for granular flow a special treatment introduced by mangeney castlenau

than the critical shear stress τ c τ e b z z tan ϕ b e d τ e b z z c z z tan ϕ b e d the slide is stationary since v is always zero in the local coordinate system the momentum equation in the x

without coulomb shear stress effect this can be rewritten as 3 18 t ρ δ t q ρ δ t q where t τ s b z x and q u d this equation is plotted in fig 3 as a dashed line if ρ δ t u d τ c and ρ δ t u d τ c i

scheme we add a step after each stage of runge kutta algorithm according to 3 23 e e 1 δ t s τ b n 3 24 e e 2 δ t s τ b 1 where 3 25 s τ b 1 ρ 0 c z x c z z τ e b z z c z y c z z τ e b z z 0 if u d δ

hydrostatic part of the governing eqs 3 4 using finite difference method on a staggered grid as shown in fig 4 in horizontal the non hydrostatic pressure at slide surface is defined at i j to align with the grid in nhwave while the pressure at the bed is defined at i 1 2 j 1 2 to avoid numerical oscillation in finite difference scheme due to odd even decoupling in vertical the non hydrostatic pressure are defined at vertical cell faces as in the keller box method stelling and zijlema 2003 the expressions for updated velocity components u v and w at their corresponding locations are 3 28 u

difference scheme in space and a runge kutta scheme for time integration a set of cases are simulated with a range of grid size as in appendix c the overall model accuracy is shown to be in between first order and second order 4 numerical tests 4 1 tsunami generation by a 2d submarine landslide this test is based on 2d laboratory experiments described in grilli et al 2017 and further utilized as a benchmark for the us national tsunami hazard mitigation program nthmp landslide tsunami benchmark workshop kirby et al 2018 the experiments were performed in a tank of width 0 25 m and working length 6 27 m fitted with a slope at an angle of 35 to the horizontal the experiment described here was performed with an initial water depth of 0 33 m slide material consisted of glass beads with density ρ b 2500 kg m 3 and diameter d 4 mm the slide material was placed initially on the slope as a triangular deposit held in place behind a sluice gate and was released by raising the gate waves were generated by the motion of the slide and time series of free surface elevations were measured at 4 gauges wg1 wg4 fig 5 grilli et al 2017 shows pictures and sketches of the experimental setup 4 1 1 numerical setup and results both the viscous and granular slide models were tested against this benchmark a sensitivity study of this case was performed by grilli et al 2017 following grilli et al 2017 we discretized the computational domain into 552 grid cells in the along flume direction and 24 grid cells in the cross flume direction with grid size of 0 01 m and 9 vertical sigma layers were used in the water layer the computed landslide shapes were compared with the experimental measurements and time series of generated waves computed at four gauges were compared with measured data in the simulations with the viscous slide model a bulk density of ρ 1951 kg m 3 was used as suggested by grilli et al 2017 several values of the effective kinematic viscosity were tested for the value of dynamic viscosity around the range of 0 0213 0 0489 kg m s estimated by grilli et al 2017 with theoretical expressions proposed by eilers 1941 frankel and acrivos 1967 and quemada 1977 the value of ν e μ e ρ 0 00001 m 2 s provided the best fit to the slide motion and shape this value is larger than that used in grilli et al 2017 and closer to the theoretical range it should be noted that unlike in the previous study we do not use an additional bottom friction term in the viscous model whereas grilli et al 2017 used a manning friction coefficient n 0 04 hence this provided an additional source of energy dissipation in their model figs 6 shows the comparisons between laboratory observations and numerical results computed by the viscous slide model blue lines with non hydrostatic pressure the non hydrostatic model is able to capture the bulge at the slide front that was not well simulated by the hydrostatic model figure 8 in grilli et al 2017 in the simulations with the granular slide model as in grilli et al 2017 the solid density is ρ s 2500 kg m 3 and the solid concentration is set to ϕ 63 4 giving the same mixture density as used for the viscous slide section 4 1 2 explains the physical basis for using relatively low values for these parameters and section 4 1 3 shows the sensitivity to these parameters as shown in fig 6 with red lines the observed slide motions are also well simulated by the non hydrostatic granular model the left panel of fig 7 shows the slide center of mass motion with respect to time s t velocity u t d s d t and acceleration a t d u d t and we see a similar motion manner in between two rheology models the time series of the generated wave surface elevations computed by nhwave coupling with viscous model and granular model are compared to those observed at the four wave gauges wg1 wg4 in right panel of fig 7 as expected the results from both models match the experimental data well and show no significant differences with each other 4 1 2 reduced friction angles in the experiment presented by grilli et al 2017 the internal and basal friction angles were measured as ϕ i n t 3 4 and ϕ b e d 2 4 these two coefficients represent the ability of the slide material to withstand a shear stress subaerially however the particles in a moving submarine mass are affected by the water buoyancy and complicated hydrodynamic force in the version of coupled granular flow and wave model developed in ma et al 2015 the liquefaction effect from the buoyancy and hydrodynamic force was solely represented by a liquefaction parameter which was prescribed empirically in the present granular model only the water buoyancy effect was included and embodied as a reduced gravity 1 ϕ ρ s ρ g in eqs 2 13 and 2 14 for c x and c y by considering the buoyancy effect only the results from the current granular model and the model based on a slope oriented coordinate system ma et al 2015 were comparable using the liquefaction parameter 1 ϕ ρ s ρ in this case we have 1 ϕ ρ s ρ 0 1876 and measured friction angles were used in the model see grilli et al 2017 fig 8 shows a comparison of slide motions using the model in ma et al 2015 and the present model we see that the granular slides move at the same speed in both simulations albeit with slightly different shapes our model applied a special treatment introduced in section 3 3 of the mechanism used to stop the landslide and this treatment might lead to the observed differences the simulated slides based on the above parameters moved slower than in the experiments apart from the buoyancy the hydrodynamic force is from solid water interactions in 3d and is hard to be analytically predicted in a depth averaged model to consider the hydrodynamic force grilli et al 2017 used 0 5 as the liquefaction parameter and obtained results in good agreement with observations this larger value of the parameter can reduce the coulomb friction and speed up the motion of the slide on the slope this treatment was equivalent to using smaller internal and basal friction angles in future work we will try to find a relationship between the hydrodynamic force and the submarine friction angles in the present work however for simplicity we empirically set the friction angles to the listed constant values 4 1 3 sensitivity to material parameters sensitivity of model results to material properties was examined by varying parameters including the effective viscosity in the viscous slide model and the basal as well as internal friction angles in the granular slide model we investigate how changes in the parameters result in not only to changes in slide motion but also changes in wave generation the viscous slide model was tested with kinematic viscosities ν e 0 00001 0 00002 and 0 00003 m 2 s which turn out to be for the slide density here around the range of 0 0213 μ e 0 0489 kg m s estimated by grilli et al 2017 fig 9 shows the slide motions for the three cases overall as would be expected increasing slide viscosity reduces its velocity although changing this parameter for landslide wave generation there is a simple rule of thumb by which the smaller the initial volume and initial acceleration and the larger submergence depth of the slide the smaller the resultant waves grilli et al 2017 here the left panel of fig 10 shows the slide center of mass motion and we see that the larger value of effective viscosity leads to a smaller initial acceleration albeit not obvious in the tests with such a small variation of the parameter the right panel of fig 10 shows time series of wave elevations generated by the corresponding slide motions at four gauges as expected the simulated free surface elevations with larger viscosity at wave gauges shows a small reduction in wave generation the effects of the two friction angles in the granular slide model were examined separately the sensitivity study for the basal friction angle was performed first in which the basal friction angle was varied as ϕ b e d 4 6 and 8 and the internal friction angle was constant at ϕ i n t 8 in all simulations as shown in fig 11 the slide with larger basal friction angles moved more slowly down the slope than the slides with smaller values especially in the tail when the slides reached the flat bottom of the tank the slide mass with the smaller parameter traveled a longer distance compared to its counterparts consistent with earlier results fig 12 shows that the slide mass accelerated more quickly and larger tsunami waves were generated by the slides with smaller basal friction angles the sensitivity on the internal friction angle was tested by setting ϕ i n t 8 12 and 16 with the basal friction angle was fixed at ϕ i n t 4 in the tests fig 13 and the left panel of fig 14 showed that the slides with different internal friction angles generally moved in a similar manner both on the plane slope and on the flat bottom this parameter however slightly affected the shapes of the slides which subsequently influenced the resulting tsunami waves as shown in right panels of fig 14 4 1 4 importance of non hydrostatic pressure in section 4 of z21a we demonstrated the importance of non hydrostatic effects in modeling the motion of a subaerial landslide on a steep slope in order to illustrate non hydrostatic effects on the submarine slide motion and resultant waves we re ran the case with the hydrostatic version of the slide model the comparisons shown in fig 15 a f illustrate the influence of the non hydrostatic pressure on the viscous slide motion while the comparison in fig 16 a f shows its effect on the granular slide motion the slide without local non hydrostatic pressure red lines collapses at a faster speed than the slide with this pressure blue lines the retention of non hydrostatic pressure contributions reduces the speed of slide motion and generates the bulge at the slide front that was observed in the experiment this demonstrates that only including hydrostatic pressure within the submarine slide model leads to a loss of detail of the smf processes the inclusion of the non hydrostatic correction in the slide motion also significantly alters the resultant waves as shown in the right panels of fig 15 for the viscous case and fig 16 for the granular case the hydrostatic model overpredicts the wave height and also shows a slight overprediction of wave phase speed leading to an earlier arrival of the leading wave at each wave gauge 4 2 3d subaerial granular landslide the second validation test is based on the experiment conducted by mohammed and fritz 2012 this experimental data set was provided as benchmark 6 for the nthmp landslide tsunami benchmark workshop kirby et al 2018 the three dimensional experiments were performed in the tsunami wave basin at oregon state university in corvallis measuring 48 40 m in length and 26 54 m in width with varying still water depths from 0 3 to 1 2 m the landslides were generated on a plane slope with angle ϕ s l o p e 27 1 to the horizontal built on one end of the wave basin as shown in fig 17 slide material consisted of naturally rounded river gravel with the particle size d 50 13 77 mm and density ρ s 2556 kg m 3 the slides were launched from a box moving at a prescribed initial velocity they continuously accelerated down the slope impacted the water surface and traveled underwater the generated waves were measured by 25 wave gauges located at x y locations slide moving direction and lateral direction in the basin with reference to the hill slope toe of which 9 wave gauges were used for comparison shown in fig 17 and table 1 in this section we reproduced one of the experiments by our model with both rheologies where the slide in a box measured 1 05 m 1 2 m 0 3 m with maximum box velocity of 2 2 m s and the still water depth h was 0 6 m the computational domain is 48 m in length and 28 m in width which was discretized into 960 grid cells with grid size of 0 05 m three vertical sigma layers were used in the water layer the slides in both simulations had bulk density of ρ 1760 kg m 3 in the simulation with granular rheology the internal and basal friction angles were set to be ϕ i n t 4 1 and ϕ b e d 2 3 which are same to the measured values in experiments the effective viscosity for subaerial dry granular flow cannot be estimated by the theoretical method in grilli et al 2017 for submarine landslide midi 2004 demonstrated that in a dry granular flow the shear stress is proportional to the normal stress with a local friction coefficient which is only function of a dimensionless parameter called the inertial number i this so called μ i rheology which is a nonlinear viscous law with a strain rate invariant and pressure dependent viscosity could be used to quantitatively predict the main viscous properties of granular flows forterre 2006 proposed a formula for the effective viscosity of dry granular flow over an inclined plane based on μ i rheology for his shallow water type avalanche equations the expression is as 4 1 μ e 2 ρ s d 50 2 ϕ s l o p e i 2 u 2 d where u and d are the velocity and flow depth along the slope respectively and the inertial number 4 2 i 5 β d 50 2 ϕ ℒ tan ϕ s l o p e tan ϕ b e d tan ϕ i n t tan ϕ s l o p e because of lack of experimental data on specific granular material properties we use basal friction angle and internal friction angle to approach two critical inclination angles where the flow is stationary when the bed slope is smaller than the lower critical inclination angle and the flow accelerates when the bed slope is larger than the higher critical inclination angle the dimensionless empirical constant β was set to be 0 136 which was measured for glass beads pouliquen 1999 while the length parameter ℒ represents the depth of flow over which a transition between the angles two critical inclination angles occurs was set to be the value of d 50 the effective viscosity was measured based on the measured velocity and maximum flow depth as shown in the upper two plots in fig 18 with black circles the estimated range of the effective viscosity is 0 5630 4 8419 kg m s and we choose μ e 1 408 kg m s to best fit the results to laboratory data on the wave generation it should be noted that the viscosity is varying with time and space in μ i rheology and we just give a rough approximation of the value in this simulation three characteristics of computed landslide motions were compared with the observations i e slide front velocity v s and maximum slide thickness along the slope and the extent of the maximum slide spread on the slope in the lateral direction in addition time series of generated waves computed at the wave gauges were compared with measured data we first compare the simulated slide motion with the observations before the slide plunges into the water fig 18 shows that the slide front velocity from both rheology models matches the observations well the granular model provides a good agreement of both the slide thickness and width compared with the measurement the small discrepancy is likely due to the lack of constraint from the box carrying the slide in our simulations in the experiment the lateral walls of the box containing the slide confined the instantaneous lateral movement of the slide after it was released on the other hand the viscous slide exhibits a larger slide thickness along the slope and more extensive spreading of the slide in lateral direction considering the intention of the experiments for granular flow this is not an unacceptable discrepancy though the difference in slide shapes is apparent the most dominant parameter with respect to the tsunami wave characteristics i e slide froude number at impact v s g h was well predicted leading to a quite similar wave form from the granular model and viscous model fig 19 generally the both models simulate the tsunami waves well although some small free surface oscillations at the stations in the centerline wave gauge 1 to 4 were not captured and a phase lag showed in between simulations and observations at the stations with 60 to the centerline wave gauge 8 and 9 4 3 field case slide at port valdez ak during 1964 alaska earthquake we finally consider a field case based on the historical submarine landslide event in port valdez ak during the 1964 alaska earthquake the earthquake triggered two main submarine landslides one of which occurred at the head of port valdez hpv slide with a slide volume of about 5 5 1 0 6 m 3 and the second occurring at the shoup bay moraine sbm slide with volume of about 2 5 1 0 8 m 3 nicolsky et al 2013 fig 20 shows a schematic view of port valdez with location and thickness of two slides the tsunami generated by the two massive smfs inundated valdez old town and shorelines around the semi enclosed water body causing severe damage and many fatalities the event has previously been used as part of a landslide tsunami benchmarking exercise described fully in kirby et al 2018 which provides a comprehensive overview of various groups simulations of the event and associated uncertainties in the range of model results obtained the total simulation time of the case was 1200 s a uniform grid size of 13 2689 m 8 9 arc seconds in x direction longitude and 16 4735 m 8 15 arc seconds in y direction latitude was used to discretize the computation domain of port valdez in 2316 570 cells three vertical layers are evenly distributed at the open boundary near valdez arm an extra computational domain with a width of 823 672 m is attached to the main domain as a sponge layer to damp the outgoing waves we modeled the scenarios that hpv and sbm slides occurred simultaneously though no evidence supports or rejects this hypothesis it is highly probable that both slides failed in same time under such a severe earthquake nicolsky et al 2013 the slide bulk density is assumed to be ρ 2000 kg m 3 based on the subsurface geotechnical investigation of material near the site conducted by shannon and hilts 1973 the grain density in granular landslide simulation was assumed to be ρ s 2556 kg m 3 and the internal and basal friction angles were set to be ϕ i n t 2 0 and ϕ b e d 4 similar to that used by macias 2017 who applied their two layer coulomb friction model landslide hysea to the case the effective kinematic viscosity in viscous landslide simulation was set to be ν e 0 5 m s 2 which is in the range of viscosity for mudslide and debris flows proposed by jiang and leblond 1993 each simulation took about 15 hours in wall clock time with 240 intel xeon e5 2692 processors and the simulation results were compared to eye witness observations of the event and observed runup distribution near the old town the hpv slide generated huge tsunami waves the backwash inundated the mckinley street on the northeast side of town and reached two blocks inland the extent of inundation from the simulated waves generally covers the observed inundation area in 1964 for both rheology models fig 21 the time series of wave elevations are shown in fig 22 a c at three locations which were flooded during the event point 37 38 and valdez hotel in fig 21 surface elevation time series computed for both rheologies at points 37 and 38 show overall a good agreement with each other particularly around the leading waves however the viscous slide causes significantly larger wave trough at point 37 about 2 min than the granular slide which appears to result from the different behavior of the slide material with different landslide rheologies at valdez hotel the wave about 0 5 m generated by the hpv slide meets the eyewitness report different from the granular model results a second wave generated by sbm slide was observed at valdez hotel with the viscous model which is more close to the real event situation table 2 provides a comparison of modeled runup to field observations collected by plafker et al 1969 at a number of locations around the perimeter of port valdez overall there is a good agreement between the observed and simulated runup at all locations both models predict the maximum wave height near the cliff mine point 1 in fig 23 where a maximum runup of 50 m was observed on the opposite shore near anderson bay points 13 15 in fig 23 and table 2 the modeled runup ranges between 20 to 30 m which is roughly in agreement with the reported runup values ranging between 20 to 24 m during the event a navigation light with a top elevation 8 m above the water level was overtopped and destroyed at the entrance to valdez narrows fig 22 d shows the wave elevation time series from two models at the light and both models provide a similar wave pattern the modeled tsunami waves over 9 m at the location are sufficient to ruin the light as was done for the laboratory case in section 4 1 4 calculations were performed using the hydrostatic versions of the viscous and granular flow models in order to show the importance of retaining non hydrostatic effects in the field case the results for hydrostatic and non hydrostatic slide simulations are compared for each rheology in figs 24 and 25 fig 24 shows the collapse process of the granular slides at different times in side views and the slide deposit at 120 s the transects cross the peak of each slide sbm and hpv and are oriented in the steepest down slope direction from the transect at sbm left one can see that the part of the slide that sits on the cliff in the range of 0 m to 500 m in x direction failed over a short time during which the most significant deviation between hydrostatic and non hydrostatic results is observed the remaining part of the slide sits on a nearly flat bed and there is no significant difference in slide motion for both model results from the transect at hpv right one sees that the slides move at a similar pace in both models the vertical acceleration effects are not strong here because of the mild slope under the slide the plan views of the two slides at 120 s show a longer extent of the landslide runout and deposit spreading in the hydrostatic simulations similar observations can be made in fig 25 for the viscous slide even though the differences in slide motion for the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic models are not as distinct as in the laboratory case in section 4 1 4 one can still see the effect of the non hydrostatic contribution on the generated waves surface elevation time series at valdez narrows navigation light which has the only offshore observation records are first used to show this effect fig 26 a b with both rheology closures the slides without non hydrostatic pressure generate larger waves especially at the second and third crests and these waves arrive slightly earlier than their counterparts from the slide with non hydrostatic pressure this observation is consistent with what was observed in the laboratory case the effect of slide non hydrostatic pressure on the generated tsunami is more obvious when looking at the time series of wave height at valdez hotel in the old town fig 26 c d the first wave from the backwash generated by the hpv slide is captured in all model configurations except the hydrostatic granular case and the wave height is consistent with the eyewitness record the viscous model also predicts a second wave generated by the sbm slide the non hydrostatic viscous simulation produces a reasonable wave height of about 0 5 m at the hotel whereas the hydrostatic simulation gives a significantly overestimated runup height of about 2 m at that location the wave height difference of the second wave is determined by the first wave generated by the sbm slide if one looks at the transect of the sbm slide at t 10 in fig 25 the peak of the slide collapses faster in the hydrostatic simulations leading to the generation of a larger leading wave crest and trough the wave height comparison in fig 26 shows that even in some cases the slide non hydrostatic pressure has minor effect on the slide motion it has significant effect on the slide induced wave in this field case the initial slide shape and bathymetry constrain the importance of the slide non hydrostatic pressure on the slide motion 5 discussions and conclusions in the companion paper z21a we propose a new two layer non hydrostatic model to simulate tsunami waves generated by smfs over irregular bathymetry and derive the governing equations for the lower layer landslide model in this paper a consistent form of the equations is generalized for the models with a granular or a newtonian viscous rheology closure and these two models are distinguished by parameters of flux coefficients and source terms regarding stresses we analyze the mathematical systems of the landslide models and prove that the system of newtonian viscous model is fully hyperbolic and the system of granular model is hyperbolic in the case where the mohr circle law is applicable i e ϕ i n t ϕ b e d that means that standard finite volume schemes are applicable to the system of governing partial differential equations then the numerical discretization of the model is presented the governing equations for the landslide model are solved using the second order tvd scheme with hll riemann solver in space and the ssp runge kutta scheme in time the non hydrostatic pressure correction is calculated by solving a poisson equation derived from mass conservation and a two step projection method is used to update velocity the well balanced property of the model for both rheology closures is proved and validated by an analytical solution two laboratory benchmarks were tested against the models and these tests involved steep slopes varying from 20 to 40 the companion paper illustrates the importance of the local non hydrostatic pressure in the slide and its vertical profile is quadratic and advection of vertical velocity in z momentum equation the simulation results in this paper show that the non hydrostatic pressure from the upper layer model to the lower layer landslide model is important too because the dynamic processes near the slide front generate high non hydrostatic pressure not only in landslide but also in water furthermore we find that in general the motion of the landslide predicted by the model with newtonian viscous rheology and coulomb friction rheology were not as different as expected if appropriate material parameters were defined a field event is investigated by our model to show its capability on real smf tsunami applications with irregular bathymetry the non hydrostatic model with two rheologies show similar results for wave amplitudes and forms and both reproduce the main tsunami characteristics observed in the event the importance of the non hydrostatic correction provided by the present model has also been shown in our simulations for a more recent tsunami event occurring at the anak krakatau volcano in 2018 grilli et al 2019a compared to the previously published results of grilli et al 2019b who applied the hydrostatic version of the present model simulations using the non hydrostatic model improved the agreement of near field runups with observations these results will be reported more extensively in a separate paper several avenues for further improvement of the present model can be envisioned the model in this paper provides a tool to reproduce past field tsunami events or potential events have not occurred but the geophysical connection between parameters used in the both rheology models to mechanical properties of the slides is not so clear in the laboratory the material properties of the idealized slide can be directly measured or estimated by analytical expression while the material properties in field case is hard to determine leading to a more arbitrary choice of model parameters a more systematic method will be developed to determine physical parameters for field events to improve the predictive capabilities of the model additional improvements and extensions to the scope of physical processes simulated by the model are also possible erosion and deposition processes can effect slide mass and motion as well as deposition pattern and overall morphology change entrainment of ambient water leads to dilation effects altering slide density and motion leading to a more extensive model with additional equations to track the entrainment and alteration of slide density iverson and george 2014 george and iverson 2014 finally a more realistic model will need to address the nonuniform particle size distribution ranging from fine particles to large blocks and boulders that are present in real slides pudesaini and mergili 2019 there are thus a number of avenues for further development and improvement for models of smf behavior for real

b 6 h s x m a x 0 0 25 5 x 0 5 2 the slide depth over the flat bottom was different in these two cases in the first case the slide depth was d 0 3 m and the hump was completely covered by the slide

23913,we describe a numerical treatment for a two layer coupled model developed for the investigation of submarine landslides and resulting tsunami generation over irregular bathymetry the landslide model is formulated in a cartesian coordinate system oriented with the still water level in order to facilitate coupling between water and ground motions motions in the upper water layer are simulated using the 3d non hydrostatic wave model nhwave governing equations for the lower layer landslide are integrated over the slide thickness and include options for choosing either newtonian viscous or granular rheology closures the lower layer equations retain the effects of non hydrostatic pressure allowing the model to simulate motions over arbitrary and locally steep bathymetry the model equations are solved using a runge kutta scheme for time integration and a godunov type finite volume scheme for spatial derivatives with non conservative terms formulated using a finite difference scheme the resulting model is verified in comparison to two laboratory experiments involving granular slide motion and compared to observations for a field event during the 1964 alaska earthquake keywords submarine landslide two layer non hydrostatic model tsunami propagation well balanced finite volume method 1 introduction in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 hereafter referred to as z21a we have described a new two layer coupled model for simulating the motion of submarine mass failures smf and generating tsunami waves over irregular bathymetry upper layer tsunami wave generation and propagation is simulated by a three dimensional non hydrostatic wave model nhwave ma et al 2012 the lower layer smf is modeled using a depth integrated model employing either viscous or granular flow rheologies the model includes the effect of non hydrostatic pressure which allows for the description of vertical acceleration of slide within the framework of a horizontally oriented coordinate system z21a demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of these modifications to the governing equations in comparison to the analytic dam break solution of mangeney et al 2000 and to computations in slope oriented coordinates ma et al 2015 the reader is referred to z21a for a description of the context for these developments and the examination of their effectiveness here we recast the lower layer equations in a consistent form for both viscous and granular flows and describe their mathematical properties the numerical discretization techniques and model validation against experimental data and field observations the classical shallow water equations for an inviscid fluid can be written as hyperbolic conservation laws and solved effectively by finite volume methods of the godunov type with appropriate riemann solvers toro 2001 leveque 2002 when simulating landslides using this approach previous researchers have generally treated the landslides as mixture of solid and fluid phases and the presence of the solid phase and the interaction effects were embodied in the mixture stress iverson and denlinger 2001 iverson and george 2014 ma et al 2015 mathematically employing different rheology closures in shallow water type landslide models can change the eigenstructure of the equations and cause the loss of the hyperbolicity due to the appearance of complex eigenvalues in particular flow regimes the majority of previous models of this type have been proven to be hyperbolic and the riemann technique commonly used for a hyperbolic pde system can be readily applied denlinger and iverson 2001 demonstrated that the conventional savage and hutter 1989 type granular flow model was fully hyperbolic because the jacobian matrices of the model had real eigenvalues george and iverson 2014 further established hyperbolicity for their more complex model equations incorporating dilatancy effects in this paper we show that the model introduced in z21a with new algorithms for the rheology closure preserves hyperbolicity the paper is organized as follows in section 2 a consistent and conservative form of the governing equations for both granular flow and newtonian viscous flow is given and the parameters for different rheology closures are discussed criteria for maintaining the hyperbolic structure of the equations are established section 3 describes the numerical treatments of the lower layer landslide model section 4 compares the model to several laboratory results and field observations and examines model sensitivity to choices of parameters conclusions and future model improvements are discussed in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations for the landslide the lower layer landslide model describes either a mud flow by a single fluid flow with an increased viscosity and density or a granular flow by a two phase flow mixture with coulomb friction rheology the governing equations are derived in cartesian coordinates

z21a a dispersion correction s d c and a portion of stress terms s τ α l from the rheology closures the term s τ α l and the remaining portions of the stress terms s τ depend on the choice of rheology closure as described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 the coefficient n indicates the non hydrostatic model if n 1 and the hydrostatic model if n 0 the dispersion correction s d c 1 3 h β h s β g is

equations 2 10 and 2 11 in z21a and depth integrated mass conservation see equation 2 13 in z21a and we approximate horizontal velocity components at surface and bottom by their depth averaged counterparts 2 2 rheology closures eq 2 1 gives a consistent form of the governing equations for both viscous and granular flow models these two models are distinguished by different rheology closures and embodied by the different expressions of s τ α l in c α and s τ in source terms section 3 in z21a gives theoretical descriptions of these two types of slide rheology this section describes their numerical treatments by specifying s τ α l and s τ for each corresponding rheology 2 2 1 newtonian viscous flow model for the case of newtonian viscous flow the stress term s τ α l in the flux coefficients c α is zero and thus c α g n s d c the source term s τ expressing the laminar viscous stresses on the right hand side of eq 2 1 is given by 2 8 s τ 1 ρ 0 τ β x d β τ t β x h β τ t z x τ b

granular flow model two sets of solid stresses are used in the granular flow model the first one is the deviatoric solid stresses used in governing equation and the second one is the solid effective stresses following the definition of soil mechanics their relation is 2 9 t e t s i p s where p s ϕ ρ s g d q s is the total pressure from solid phase and q s is non hydrostatic pressure contributed by the solid phase the solid effective stresses are estimated from the z momentum equation 3 18 in z21a this equation can be simplified by assuming that vertical normal solid stress is dominant and by having momentum correction coefficients γ z x γ z y 1 corresponding to weak vertical variations of horizontal velocity components within the slide after which the equation may be rewritten as 2 10 τ e b z z ρ d w d t d ϕ ρ s g d q s q t q b where d w d t denotes the total time derivative d d t t u x v y of the depth averaged vertical velocity w in non hydrostatic model all terms in this equation should be retained and the total pressure from solid phase p s in 2 9 should include non hydrostatic pressure when the hydrostatic model is used the vertical acceleration effect the terms ρ d w d t d q s q t q b in 2 10 is not considered and τ e b z z contains only the hydrostatic pressure from the solid phase i e p s ϕ ρ s g d to give consistent equations for both hydrostatic and non hydrostatic models eq 2 10 and the expression for p s can be written as 2 11 τ e b z z ϕ ρ s g d n ρ d w d t d q s q t q b 2 12 p s ϕ ρ s g d n q s all other stress components at the bed z h s may be expressed in terms of τ e b z z using equations 3 29 and 3 30 in z21a for the coulomb friction model the flux coefficients and s τ α l in eq 2 1 are 2 13 c x c x x c z z ϕ ρ s ρ g 1 ϕ ρ s ρ g n c x x c z z d w d t

ρ d to avoid negative values of the total pressure p s of the solid phase at the bed the range of q s is set to be ϕ ρ s g d ϕ ρ s g d the lower bound corresponds to the status that the grains do not push each other loss of gravity where the intergranular pressure which is transmitted through grain to grain at the contact points is vanished the negative p s is not realistic since the grains are solid and do not draw each other the upper bound is an ad hoc limit letting the value falls in a range symmetric about zero non hydrostatic pressure of the solid phase 2 3 hyperbolicity of the governing equations to find the characteristics of the equations a simplified one dimensional problem is considered 2 17 e t f x s τ s p u s p l where e d u d w d t and f u d γ x x u u d c x d 2 2 γ x z w d t the jacobian matrix of the system is 2 18 a 0 1 0 γ x x u 2 c x d 2 γ x x u u 0 γ x z u w γ x z w γ x z u with eigenvalues 2 19 λ l r γ x x u γ x x γ x x 1 u 2 c x d and λ m γ x z u where the subscripts l r and m represent the left right and middle characteristic field respectively to guarantee the hyperbolicity of the system we have to ensure that the argument of the square root in λ l r is 0 a sufficient condition for this is that γ x x 1 and c x 0 non negativity of the flux coefficients will be proved in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 2 3 1 newtonian viscous flow model for the hydrostatic model c α g is always positive and hyperbolicity is guaranteed as γ x x is always 1 for the non hydrostatic model the range of s d c is artificially set to g g to ensure hyperbolicity of the system under this assumption an ad hoc limit of h β h s β 3 is applied to the bathymetry for a 2d open channel flow where the slide surface is parallel to the bed the maximum slope angle can be up to 60 to ensure s d c in the range of g g 2 3 2 granular flow model for the case of granular flow we examine eqs 2 13 and 2 14 for c α term by term the first term in c α is non negative as long as c x x c z z 0 and c y y c z z 0 we rewrite the expression for c z z in equation c 9 of z21a as 2 20 c z z c 33 c 13 tan ϕ b e d 2 c 13 2 k x a c t p a s tan 2 ϕ b e d c 23 2 k y a c t p a s x a c t p a s where c z z is non negative whenever k x a c t p a s tan 2 ϕ b e d the same conclusion is true for c x x and c y y fig 2 shows a shaded region where k x a c t p a s tan 2 ϕ b e d we find that in all cases where the mohr circle law is applicable i e ϕ i n t ϕ b e d the hyperbolicity is guaranteed the second term in c α is non negative as the expression of the mixture density ρ ρ s ϕ ρ f 1 ϕ leads to 1 ϕ ρ s ρ 0 in the non hydrostatic model where n 1 including the third and the last terms may cause the loss of hyperbolicity in certain extreme cases in certain locations where c x x c z z 0 1 a large value of the non hydrostatic pressure q s ρ g d 1 c x x c z z ϕ ρ s g d could make c α 0 this may only happen when bed slope is quite small i e c x x c z z is small for example when the bed is flat c x x c z z 0 q s has to be smaller than 1 ϕ ρ f g d i e hydrostatic pressure from pore fluid when slope is mild however the non hydrostatic pressure in a shallow water type model that accounts for the vertical acceleration is small and most likely in the range where hyperbolicity is guaranteed a locally large value of s d c g could also lead to c α 0 but it only happens when very steep slopes included as we discussed in section 2 3 1 in such cases c α is artificially set to zero to ensure the system hyperbolicity 3 numerical methods the landslide model is developed here both with and without non hydrostatic pressure corrections in the hydrostatic model the governing equation 2 1 is solved using a finite volume tvd scheme in space and a runge kutta scheme in time for the non hydrostatic model a two step projection method is used for the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic components of the governing equations in the first step the governing equations with the coefficient n 1 but without non hydrostatic pressure are solved using the same approach as for the hydrostatic model then the non hydrostatic pressure correction is determined by solving a poisson equation and u v and w are updated accordingly the fortran 95 code is parallelized using openmpi https www open mpi org and the linear system resulting from the poisson equation is solved using hypre http www llnl gov casc hypre we employ the wetting drying treatment in nhwave ma et al 2012 for horizontal moving boundaries 3 1 time integration integration of the equations in time is carried out using the second order nonlinear strong stability preserving runge kutta scheme introduced by gottlieb et al 2001 the first stage of the second order runge kutta algorithm is 3 1 e 1 e n δ t f x g y n s τ n s p u n s

2 e n 1 2 e 2 e is the final value of the conserved variable for the hydrostatic model i e e n 1 e when using the non hydrostatic model we set coefficient n to one and calculate this intermediate value of conserved variable with eqs 3 1 3 3 a two step projection method is then necessary to obtain the solution at the n 1 time level with non hydrostatic pressure as 3 4 e n 1 e δ t s q the time step δ t is allowed to vary in time and is controlled by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion 3 5 δ t c f l min min δ x u i j c x d i j min δ y v i j c y d i j where c f l is the courant number which is set to 0 5 throughout simulations to ensure stability of the computations this numerical scheme is different from the approach used for the upper layer wave model nhwave where the two step projection method is applied in each runge kutta stage in a one layer model with the strategy of nhwave even if in each intermediate runge kutta stage the velocity is divergence free the updated final velocity calculated under this structure may still violate the divergence free condition for example after the second step of the projection method in the first stage of the second order runge kutta algorithm 3 6 u 1 x v 1 y w t 1 w b 1 d 1 0 and after the second step of the projection method in the second stage of the second order runge kutta algorithm 3 7 u 2 x v 2 y w t 2 w b 2 d 2 0 the velocity at the final stage of the runge kutta algorithm however gives 3 8 u n 1 x v n 1 y w t n 1 w b n 1 d n 1 1 2 u n 1 2 u 2 x 1 2 v n 1 2 v 2 y 1 2 w t n 1 2 w t 2 1 2 w b n 1 2 w b 2 1 2 d n 1 2 d 2 0 using the time integration algorithm from eq 3 1 3 4 can avoid this divergence free violation 3 2 spatial discretization eqs 3 1 and 3 2 are discretized using a godunov type finite volume method leveque 2002 based on a hll riemann solver toro 2001 and a second order reconstruction operator the pvm hll method introduced by castro díaz and fernández nieto 2012 is used combined with a muscl reconstruction method pvm polynomial viscosity matrix can be seen as a generalization of many well known solvers e g lax friedrichs force gforce and hll toro 2013 with well balanced numerical schemes this method is adopted in our model because of its well balanced property escalante et al 2018 the well balanced property of our model is demonstrated in appendix b where appendix b 1 shows the analytical solutions and appendix b 2 shows the numerical test results eq 2 17 is discretized as 3 9 e i n 1 e i n δ t δ x f i 1 2 hll f i 1 2 hll δ t δ x s p l i 1 2 s p l i 1 2 δ t s t i s b i s τ i s p u i where f hll is the flux at the cell interface calculated by hll riemann solver of which the implementations are same to the ones in nhwave ma et al 2012 2015 to achieve second order spatial accuracy the conservative variables on the left and right sides of cell faces are reconstructed from cell center data by the muscl reconstruction method with minmod limiter the variables of bed surface at cell interfaces are h s i 1 2 l d i 1 2 l h i 1 2 l and h s i 1 2 r d i 1 2 r h i 1 2 r hll riemann solver is employed to approach the wave speed s l and s r at cell faces and the flux f hll can be written as 3 10 f hll e l e r 1 2 1 α 1 f e l 1 2 1 α 1 f e r 1 2 α 0 e r e l where 3 11 α 0 s r s l s l s r s r s l α 1 s r s l s r s l the dispersion correction s d c in fluxes f e l and f e r is discretized by central difference scheme and then solved by finite volume method as a part of fluxes in eq 3 9 s p l i 1 2 and s p l i 1 2 are fluxes of the source term at cell faces discretized by a well balanced upwind scheme as 3 12 s p l i 1 2 1 2 α 0 g c x i 1 2 h s i 1 2 r h s i 1 2 l 1 2 α 1 1 g d i 1 2 l d i 1 2 r h s i 1 2 r h s i 1 2 l 1 2 g d i 1 2 l d i 1 2 r h s i 1 2

by a central difference scheme in this model the pvm method is used to avoid source term causing numerical instability instead of the surface gradient method sgm zhou et al 2001 used in nhwave we found that when bed slope is large sgm may lead to negative depth as demonstrated next in sgm the cell face value of slide depth is obtained by d i 1 2 l h s i 1 2 h i 1 2 l and d i 1 2 r h s i 1 2 h i 1 2 r where h s i 1 2 is discretized by a central difference scheme and h i 1 2 l r is reconstructed by the muscl reconstruction method in certain cases δ h i in the expression of h i 1 2 l can be 3 14 δ h i avg h i 1 h i δ x h i h i 1 δ x 0 since 3 15 h s i 1 2 h s i 1 2 δ x h s i 1 h s i δ x we have 3 16 d i 1 2 l h s i 1 2 h i 1 2 l d i 1 2 h s i 1 h s i when the bed slope is so large that h s i h s i 1 2 d i the slide depth at the cell center d i 1 2 l is negative 3 3 numerical treatment for cessation of granular flow for granular flow a special treatment introduced by mangeney castlenau

than the critical shear stress τ c τ e b z z tan ϕ b e d τ e b z z c z z tan ϕ b e d the slide is stationary since v is always zero in the local coordinate system the momentum equation in the x

without coulomb shear stress effect this can be rewritten as 3 18 t ρ δ t q ρ δ t q where t τ s b z x and q u d this equation is plotted in fig 3 as a dashed line if ρ δ t u d τ c and ρ δ t u d τ c i

hydrostatic part of the governing eqs 3 4 using finite difference method on a staggered grid as shown in fig 4 in horizontal the non hydrostatic pressure at slide surface is defined at i j to align with the grid in nhwave while the pressure at the bed is defined at i 1 2 j 1 2 to avoid numerical oscillation in finite difference scheme due to odd even decoupling in vertical the non hydrostatic pressure are defined at vertical cell faces as in the keller box method stelling and zijlema 2003 the expressions for updated velocity components u v and w at their corresponding locations are 3 28 u

bottom which is used to update u n 1 v n 1 and w n 1 with eqs 3 28 3 29 and 3 30 to test the convergence property of the model which is solved by both a godunov type finite volume scheme and a finite difference scheme in space and a runge kutta scheme for time integration a set of cases are simulated with a range of grid size as in appendix c the overall model accuracy is shown to be in between first order and second order 4 numerical tests 4 1 tsunami generation by a 2d submarine landslide this test is based on 2d laboratory experiments described in grilli et al 2017 and further utilized as a benchmark for the us national tsunami hazard mitigation program nthmp landslide tsunami benchmark workshop kirby et al 2018 the experiments were performed in a tank of width 0 25 m and working length 6 27 m fitted with a slope at an angle of 35 to the horizontal the experiment described here was performed with an initial water depth of 0 33 m slide material consisted of glass beads with density ρ b 2500 kg m 3 and diameter d 4 mm the slide material was placed initially on the slope as a triangular deposit held in place behind a sluice gate and was released by raising the gate waves were generated by the motion of the slide and time series of free surface elevations were measured at 4 gauges wg1 wg4 fig 5 grilli et al 2017 shows pictures and sketches of the experimental setup 4 1 1 numerical setup and results both the viscous and granular slide models were tested against this benchmark a sensitivity study of this case was performed by grilli et al 2017 following grilli et al 2017 we discretized the computational domain into 552 grid cells in the along flume direction and 24 grid cells in the cross flume direction with grid size of 0 01 m and 9 vertical sigma layers were used in the water layer the computed landslide shapes were compared with the experimental measurements and time series of generated waves computed at four gauges were compared with measured data in the simulations with the viscous slide model a bulk density of ρ 1951 kg m 3 was used as suggested by grilli et al 2017 several values of the effective kinematic viscosity were tested for the value of dynamic viscosity around the range of 0 0213 0 0489 kg m s estimated by grilli et al 2017 with theoretical expressions proposed by eilers 1941 frankel and acrivos 1967 and quemada 1977 the value of ν e μ e ρ 0 00001 m 2 s provided the best fit to the slide motion and shape this value is larger than that used in grilli et al 2017 and closer to the theoretical range it should be noted that unlike in the previous study we do not use an additional bottom friction term in the viscous model whereas grilli et al 2017 used a manning friction coefficient n 0 04 hence this provided an additional source of energy dissipation in their model figs 6 shows the comparisons between laboratory observations and numerical results computed by the viscous slide model blue lines with non hydrostatic pressure the non hydrostatic model is able to capture the bulge at the slide front that was not well simulated by the hydrostatic model figure 8 in grilli et al 2017 in the simulations with the granular slide model as in grilli et al 2017 the solid density is ρ s 2500 kg m 3 and the solid concentration is set to ϕ 63 4 giving the same mixture density as used for the viscous slide section 4 1 2 explains the physical basis for using relatively low values for these parameters and section 4 1 3 shows the sensitivity to these parameters as shown in fig 6 with red lines the observed slide motions are also well simulated by the non hydrostatic granular model the left panel of fig 7 shows the slide center of mass motion with respect to time s t velocity u t d s d t and acceleration a t d u d t and we see a similar motion manner in between two rheology models the time series of the generated wave surface elevations computed by nhwave coupling with viscous model and granular model are compared to those observed at the four wave gauges wg1 wg4 in right panel of fig 7 as expected the results from both models match the experimental data well and show no significant differences with each other 4 1 2 reduced friction angles in the experiment presented by grilli et al 2017 the internal and basal friction angles were measured as ϕ i n t 3 4 and ϕ b e d 2 4 these two coefficients represent the ability of the slide material to withstand a shear stress subaerially however the particles in a moving submarine mass are affected by the water buoyancy and complicated hydrodynamic force in the version of coupled granular flow and wave model developed in ma et al 2015 the liquefaction effect from the buoyancy and hydrodynamic force was solely represented by a liquefaction parameter which was prescribed empirically in the present granular model only the water buoyancy effect was included and embodied as a reduced gravity 1 ϕ ρ s ρ g in eqs 2 13 and 2 14 for c x and c y by considering the buoyancy effect only the results from the current granular model and the model based on a slope oriented coordinate system ma et al 2015 were comparable using the liquefaction parameter 1 ϕ ρ s ρ in this case we have 1 ϕ ρ s ρ 0 1876 and measured friction angles were used in the model see grilli et al 2017 fig 8 shows a comparison of slide motions using the model in ma et al 2015 and the present model we see that the granular slides move at the same speed in both simulations albeit with slightly different shapes our model applied a special treatment introduced in section 3 3 of the mechanism used to stop the landslide and this treatment might lead to the observed differences the simulated slides based on the above parameters moved slower than in the experiments apart from the buoyancy the hydrodynamic force is from solid water interactions in 3d and is hard to be analytically predicted in a depth averaged model to consider the hydrodynamic force grilli et al 2017 used 0 5 as the liquefaction parameter and obtained results in good agreement with observations this larger value of the parameter can reduce the coulomb friction and speed up the motion of the slide on the slope this treatment was equivalent to using smaller internal and basal friction angles in future work we will try to find a relationship between the hydrodynamic force and the submarine friction angles in the present work however for simplicity we empirically set the friction angles to the listed constant values 4 1 3 sensitivity to material parameters sensitivity of model results to material properties was examined by varying parameters including the effective viscosity in the viscous slide model and the basal as well as internal friction angles in the granular slide model we investigate how changes in the parameters result in not only to changes in slide motion but also changes in wave generation the viscous slide model was tested with kinematic viscosities ν e 0 00001 0 00002 and 0 00003 m 2 s which turn out to be for the slide density here around the range of 0 0213 μ e 0 0489 kg m s estimated by grilli et al 2017 fig 9 shows the slide motions for the three cases overall as would be expected increasing slide viscosity reduces its velocity although changing this parameter for landslide wave generation there is a simple rule of thumb by which the smaller the initial volume and initial acceleration and the larger submergence depth of the slide the smaller the resultant waves grilli et al 2017 here the left panel of fig 10 shows the slide center of mass motion and we see that the larger value of effective viscosity leads to a smaller initial acceleration albeit not obvious in the tests with such a small variation of the parameter the right panel of fig 10 shows time series of wave elevations generated by the corresponding slide motions at four gauges as expected the simulated free surface elevations with larger viscosity at wave gauges shows a small reduction in wave generation the effects of the two friction angles in the granular slide model were examined separately the sensitivity study for the basal friction angle was performed first in which the basal friction angle was varied as ϕ b e d 4 6 and 8 and the internal friction angle was constant at ϕ i n t 8 in all simulations as shown in fig 11 the slide with larger basal friction angles moved more slowly down the slope than the slides with smaller values especially in the tail when the slides reached the flat bottom of the tank the slide mass with the smaller parameter traveled a longer distance compared to its counterparts consistent with earlier results fig 12 shows that the slide mass accelerated more quickly and larger tsunami waves were generated by the slides with smaller basal friction angles the sensitivity on the internal friction angle was tested by setting ϕ i n t 8 12 and 16 with the basal friction angle was fixed at ϕ i n t 4 in the tests fig 13 and the left panel of fig 14 showed that the slides with different internal friction angles generally moved in a similar manner both on the plane slope and on the flat bottom this parameter however slightly affected the shapes of the slides which subsequently influenced the resulting tsunami waves as shown in right panels of fig 14 4 1 4 importance of non hydrostatic pressure in section 4 of z21a we demonstrated the importance of non hydrostatic effects in modeling the motion of a subaerial landslide on a steep slope in order to illustrate non hydrostatic effects on the submarine slide motion and resultant waves we re ran the case with the hydrostatic version of the slide model the comparisons shown in fig 15 a f illustrate the influence of the non hydrostatic pressure on the viscous slide motion while the comparison in fig 16 a f shows its effect on the granular slide motion the slide without local non hydrostatic pressure red lines collapses at a faster speed than the slide with this pressure blue lines the retention of non hydrostatic pressure contributions reduces the speed of slide motion and generates the bulge at the slide front that was observed in the experiment this demonstrates that only including hydrostatic pressure within the submarine slide model leads to a loss of detail of the smf processes the inclusion of the non hydrostatic correction in the slide motion also significantly alters the resultant waves as shown in the right panels of fig 15 for the viscous case and fig 16 for the granular case the hydrostatic model overpredicts the wave height and also shows a slight overprediction of wave phase speed leading to an earlier arrival of the leading wave at each wave gauge 4 2 3d subaerial granular landslide the second validation test is based on the experiment conducted by mohammed and fritz 2012 this experimental data set was provided as benchmark 6 for the nthmp landslide tsunami benchmark workshop kirby et al 2018 the three dimensional experiments were performed in the tsunami wave basin at oregon state university in corvallis measuring 48 40 m in length and 26 54 m in width with varying still water depths from 0 3 to 1 2 m the landslides were generated on a plane slope with angle ϕ s l o p e 27 1 to the horizontal built on one end of the wave basin as shown in fig 17 slide material consisted of naturally rounded river gravel with the particle size d 50 13 77 mm and density ρ s 2556 kg m 3 the slides were launched from a box moving at a prescribed initial velocity they continuously accelerated down the slope impacted the water surface and traveled underwater the generated waves were measured by 25 wave gauges located at x y locations slide moving direction and lateral direction in the basin with reference to the hill slope toe of which 9 wave gauges were used for comparison shown in fig 17 and table 1 in this section we reproduced one of the experiments by our model with both rheologies where the slide in a box measured 1 05 m 1 2 m 0 3 m with maximum box velocity of 2 2 m s and the still water depth h was 0 6 m the computational domain is 48 m in length and 28 m in width which was discretized into 960 grid cells with grid size of 0 05 m three vertical sigma layers were used in the water layer the slides in both simulations had bulk density of ρ 1760 kg m 3 in the simulation with granular rheology the internal and basal friction angles were set to be ϕ i n t 4 1 and ϕ b e d 2 3 which are same to the measured values in experiments the effective viscosity for subaerial dry granular flow cannot be estimated by the theoretical method in grilli et al 2017 for submarine landslide midi 2004 demonstrated that in a dry granular flow the shear stress is proportional to the normal stress with a local friction coefficient which is only function of a dimensionless parameter called the inertial number i this so called μ i rheology which is a nonlinear viscous law with a strain rate invariant and pressure dependent viscosity could be used to quantitatively predict the main viscous properties of granular flows forterre 2006 proposed a formula for the effective viscosity of dry granular flow over an inclined plane based on μ i rheology for his shallow water type avalanche equations the expression is as 4 1 μ e 2 ρ s d 50 2 ϕ s l o p e i 2 u 2 d where u and d are the velocity and flow depth along the slope respectively and the inertial number 4 2 i 5 β d 50 2 ϕ ℒ tan ϕ s l o p e tan ϕ b e d tan ϕ i n t tan ϕ s l o p e because of lack of experimental data on specific granular material properties we use basal friction angle and internal friction angle to approach two critical inclination angles where the flow is stationary when the bed slope is smaller than the lower critical inclination angle and the flow accelerates when the bed slope is larger than the higher critical inclination angle the dimensionless empirical constant β was set to be 0 136 which was measured for glass beads pouliquen 1999 while the length parameter ℒ represents the depth of flow over which a transition between the angles two critical inclination angles occurs was set to be the value of d 50 the effective viscosity was measured based on the measured velocity and maximum flow depth as shown in the upper two plots in fig 18 with black circles the estimated range of the effective viscosity is 0 5630 4 8419 kg m s and we choose μ e 1 408 kg m s to best fit the results to laboratory data on the wave generation it should be noted that the viscosity is varying with time and space in μ i rheology and we just give a rough approximation of the value in this simulation three characteristics of computed landslide motions were compared with the observations i e slide front velocity v s and maximum slide thickness along the slope and the extent of the maximum slide spread on the slope in the lateral direction in addition time series of generated waves computed at the wave gauges were compared with measured data we first compare the simulated slide motion with the observations before the slide plunges into the water fig 18 shows that the slide front velocity from both rheology models matches the observations well the granular model provides a good agreement of both the slide thickness and width compared with the measurement the small discrepancy is likely due to the lack of constraint from the box carrying the slide in our simulations in the experiment the lateral walls of the box containing the slide confined the instantaneous lateral movement of the slide after it was released on the other hand the viscous slide exhibits a larger slide thickness along the slope and more extensive spreading of the slide in lateral direction considering the intention of the experiments for granular flow this is not an unacceptable discrepancy though the difference in slide shapes is apparent the most dominant parameter with respect to the tsunami wave characteristics i e slide froude number at impact v s g h was well predicted leading to a quite similar wave form from the granular model and viscous model fig 19 generally the both models simulate the tsunami waves well although some small free surface oscillations at the stations in the centerline wave gauge 1 to 4 were not captured and a phase lag showed in between simulations and observations at the stations with 60 to the centerline wave gauge 8 and 9 4 3 field case slide at port valdez ak during 1964 alaska earthquake we finally consider a field case based on the historical submarine landslide event in port valdez ak during the 1964 alaska earthquake the earthquake triggered two main submarine landslides one of which occurred at the head of port valdez hpv slide with a slide volume of about 5 5 1 0 6 m 3 and the second occurring at the shoup bay moraine sbm slide with volume of about 2 5 1 0 8 m 3 nicolsky et al 2013 fig 20 shows a schematic view of port valdez with location and thickness of two slides the tsunami generated by the two massive smfs inundated valdez old town and shorelines around the semi enclosed water body causing severe damage and many fatalities the event has previously been used as part of a landslide tsunami benchmarking exercise described fully in kirby et al 2018 which provides a comprehensive overview of various groups simulations of the event and associated uncertainties in the range of model results obtained the total simulation time of the case was 1200 s a uniform grid size of 13 2689 m 8 9 arc seconds in x direction longitude and 16 4735 m 8 15 arc seconds in y direction latitude was used to discretize the computation domain of port valdez in 2316 570 cells three vertical layers are evenly distributed at the open boundary near valdez arm an extra computational domain with a width of 823 672 m is attached to the main domain as a sponge layer to damp the outgoing waves we modeled the scenarios that hpv and sbm slides occurred simultaneously though no evidence supports or rejects this hypothesis it is highly probable that both slides failed in same time under such a severe earthquake nicolsky et al 2013 the slide bulk density is assumed to be ρ 2000 kg m 3 based on the subsurface geotechnical investigation of material near the site conducted by shannon and hilts 1973 the grain density in granular landslide simulation was assumed to be ρ s 2556 kg m 3 and the internal and basal friction angles were set to be ϕ i n t 2 0 and ϕ b e d 4 similar to that used by macias 2017 who applied their two layer coulomb friction model landslide hysea to the case the effective kinematic viscosity in viscous landslide simulation was set to be ν e 0 5 m s 2 which is in the range of viscosity for mudslide and debris flows proposed by jiang and leblond 1993 each simulation took about 15 hours in wall clock time with 240 intel xeon e5 2692 processors and the simulation results were compared to eye witness observations of the event and observed runup distribution near the old town the hpv slide generated huge tsunami waves the backwash inundated the mckinley street on the northeast side of town and reached two blocks inland the extent of inundation from the simulated waves generally covers the observed inundation area in 1964 for both rheology models fig 21 the time series of wave elevations are shown in fig 22 a c at three locations which were flooded during the event point 37 38 and valdez hotel in fig 21 surface elevation time series computed for both rheologies at points 37 and 38 show overall a good agreement with each other particularly around the leading waves however the viscous slide causes significantly larger wave trough at point 37 about 2 min than the granular slide which appears to result from the different behavior of the slide material with different landslide rheologies at valdez hotel the wave about 0 5 m generated by the hpv slide meets the eyewitness report different from the granular model results a second wave generated by sbm slide was observed at valdez hotel with the viscous model which is more close to the real event situation table 2 provides a comparison of modeled runup to field observations collected by plafker et al 1969 at a number of locations around the perimeter of port valdez overall there is a good agreement between the observed and simulated runup at all locations both models predict the maximum wave height near the cliff mine point 1 in fig 23 where a maximum runup of 50 m was observed on the opposite shore near anderson bay points 13 15 in fig 23 and table 2 the modeled runup ranges between 20 to 30 m which is roughly in agreement with the reported runup values ranging between 20 to 24 m during the event a navigation light with a top elevation 8 m above the water level was overtopped and destroyed at the entrance to valdez narrows fig 22 d shows the wave elevation time series from two models at the light and both models provide a similar wave pattern the modeled tsunami waves over 9 m at the location are sufficient to ruin the light as was done for the laboratory case in section 4 1 4 calculations were performed using the hydrostatic versions of the viscous and granular flow models in order to show the importance of retaining non hydrostatic effects in the field case the results for hydrostatic and non hydrostatic slide simulations are compared for each rheology in figs 24 and 25 fig 24 shows the collapse process of the granular slides at different times in side views and the slide deposit at 120 s the transects cross the peak of each slide sbm and hpv and are oriented in the steepest down slope direction from the transect at sbm left one can see that the part of the slide that sits on the cliff in the range of 0 m to 500 m in x direction failed over a short time during which the most significant deviation between hydrostatic and non hydrostatic results is observed the remaining part of the slide sits on a nearly flat bed and there is no significant difference in slide motion for both model results from the transect at hpv right one sees that the slides move at a similar pace in both models the vertical acceleration effects are not strong here because of the mild slope under the slide the plan views of the two slides at 120 s show a longer extent of the landslide runout and deposit spreading in the hydrostatic simulations similar observations can be made in fig 25 for the viscous slide even though the differences in slide motion for the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic models are not as distinct as in the laboratory case in section 4 1 4 one can still see the effect of the non hydrostatic contribution on the generated waves surface elevation time series at valdez narrows navigation light which has the only offshore observation records are first used to show this effect fig 26 a b with both rheology closures the slides without non hydrostatic pressure generate larger waves especially at the second and third crests and these waves arrive slightly earlier than their counterparts from the slide with non hydrostatic pressure this observation is consistent with what was observed in the laboratory case the effect of slide non hydrostatic pressure on the generated tsunami is more obvious when looking at the time series of wave height at valdez hotel in the old town fig 26 c d the first wave from the backwash generated by the hpv slide is captured in all model configurations except the hydrostatic granular case and the wave height is consistent with the eyewitness record the viscous model also predicts a second wave generated by the sbm slide the non hydrostatic viscous simulation produces a reasonable wave height of about 0 5 m at the hotel whereas the hydrostatic simulation gives a significantly overestimated runup height of about 2 m at that location the wave height difference of the second wave is determined by the first wave generated by the sbm slide if one looks at the transect of the sbm slide at t 10 in fig 25 the peak of the slide collapses faster in the hydrostatic simulations leading to the generation of a larger leading wave crest and trough the wave height comparison in fig 26 shows that even in some cases the slide non hydrostatic pressure has minor effect on the slide motion it has significant effect on the slide induced wave in this field case the initial slide shape and bathymetry constrain the importance of the slide non hydrostatic pressure on the slide motion 5 discussions and conclusions in the companion paper z21a we propose a new two layer non hydrostatic model to simulate tsunami waves generated by smfs over irregular bathymetry and derive the governing equations for the lower layer landslide model in this paper a consistent form of the equations is generalized for the models with a granular or a newtonian viscous rheology closure and these two models are distinguished by parameters of flux coefficients and source terms regarding stresses we analyze the mathematical systems of the landslide models and prove that the system of newtonian viscous model is fully hyperbolic and the system of granular model is hyperbolic in the case where the mohr circle law is applicable i e ϕ i n t ϕ b e d that means that standard finite volume schemes are applicable to the system of governing partial differential equations then the numerical discretization of the model is presented the governing equations for the landslide model are solved using the second order tvd scheme with hll riemann solver in space and the ssp runge kutta scheme in time the non hydrostatic pressure correction is calculated by solving a poisson equation derived from mass conservation and a two step projection method is used to update velocity the well balanced property of the model for both rheology closures is proved and validated by an analytical solution two laboratory benchmarks were tested against the models and these tests involved steep slopes varying from 20 to 40 the companion paper illustrates the importance of the local non hydrostatic pressure in the slide and its vertical profile is quadratic and advection of vertical velocity in z momentum equation the simulation results in this paper show that the non hydrostatic pressure from the upper layer model to the lower layer landslide model is important too because the dynamic processes near the slide front generate high non hydrostatic pressure not only in landslide but also in water furthermore we find that in general the motion of the landslide predicted by the model with newtonian viscous rheology and coulomb friction rheology were not as different as expected if appropriate material parameters were defined a field event is investigated by our model to show its capability on real smf tsunami applications with irregular bathymetry the non hydrostatic model with two rheologies show similar results for wave amplitudes and forms and both reproduce the main tsunami characteristics observed in the event the importance of the non hydrostatic correction provided by the present model has also been shown in our simulations for a more recent tsunami event occurring at the anak krakatau volcano in 2018 grilli et al 2019a compared to the previously published results of grilli et al 2019b who applied the hydrostatic version of the present model simulations using the non hydrostatic model improved the agreement of near field runups with observations these results will be reported more extensively in a separate paper several avenues for further improvement of the present model can be envisioned the model in this paper provides a tool to reproduce past field tsunami events or potential events have not occurred but the geophysical connection between parameters used in the both rheology models to mechanical properties of the slides is not so clear in the laboratory the material properties of the idealized slide can be directly measured or estimated by analytical expression while the material properties in field case is hard to determine leading to a more arbitrary choice of model parameters a more systematic method will be developed to determine physical parameters for field events to improve the predictive capabilities of the model additional improvements and extensions to the scope of physical processes simulated by the model are also possible erosion and deposition processes can effect slide mass and motion as well as deposition pattern and overall morphology change entrainment of ambient water leads to dilation effects altering slide density and motion leading to a more extensive model with additional equations to track the entrainment and alteration of slide density iverson and george 2014 george and iverson 2014 finally a more realistic model will need to address the nonuniform particle size distribution ranging from fine particles to large blocks and boulders that are present in real slides pudesaini and mergili 2019 there are thus a number of avenues for further development and improvement for models of smf behavior for real

dissipation numerical models 1 introduction the flow in the bottom boundary layer bbl of lakes and coastal oceans is typically oscillating due to surface waves internal waves along the thermocline and tides the dynamics of oscillating turbulent bbls are of significant importance to understand mixing and transport processes strong turbulence production and mixing in turbulent bbls results in enhanced vertical transport of mass and momentum on basin scales munk 1966 imberger 1998 ivey and nokes 1989 the ability to characterize bbls is required to parameterize the bottom drag in

show that in the case of low current velocities turbulence in an oscillatory bbl can become intermittent and unsteady and consequently the log law does not always apply for example ackerman et al 2001

2001 and the bbl forced by low speed oscillatory currents in lake alpnach lorke et al 2002 has significant scatter of both friction velocity and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation relative to log law predictions the non equilibrium turbulence associated with an oscillatory flow likely causes the deviation from log law behavior lorke et al 2002 mellor 2002 on the other hand stokes second problem applies to laminar flow applying it to characterize turbulent environmental bbls results in inaccuracies in modeling the velocity distribution and turbulent viscosity lorke et al 2002 furthermore the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy in field studies which enables parameterization of turbulent mixing and biogeochemical fluxes e g lorke 2007 bouffard and lemmin 2013 is typically calculated from the theoretical methods such as inertial dissipation method idm or the temperature microstructure method tmm using batchelor fitting these methods rely on the assumption of steady isotropic and homogeneous turbulence that do not apply in the boundary layers jabbari et al 2015 2016 therefore in addition to measurement errors the estimation from these methods can include methodological errors hence there remains a need to investigate comprehensively the applicability of the analytical and theoretical models to predict the kinematics of oscillating bbls in lakes and coastal oceans and evaluate existing and new models that allow the prediction of flow characteristics based on readily observed flow variables computational models have contributed widely to the understanding of oscillating flows direct numerical simulations dns e g spalart and baldwin 1988 have focused on the disturbed laminar and intermittently turbulent regimes and presented a high reynolds number theory for wall stress and freestream velocity profiles large eddy simulations les have extended oscillating flow studies to higher reynolds numbers in the fully turbulent regime radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 hsu et al 2000 captured the transition to the intermittent turbulent regime as well as the phase lag between the wall shear stress and the freestream oscillations for turbulent oscillating flows many other numerical studies e g salon et al 2007 have reproduced the oscillating bbl experiments by jensen et al 1989 rather than model the bbl with a reynolds averaged model requiring turbulence closure and a bottom drag parameterization e g umlauf et al 2015 we apply wall resolved les and dns the present study focuses on the difficulty in measuring and analytically modeling the kinematics of oscillating turbulent bbls in lakes and coastal oceans the objectives are to i assess the accuracy of the analytical models log law and stokes second problem for the prediction of turbulent oscillating geophysical bbls boundary layer thickness turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and reynolds shear stresses against a high fidelity dns and les database of oscillating boundary layer flows ranging from laminar to fully turbulent and ii develop new nondimensional models from the dns and les data which may be used to characterize oscillating turbulent bbls at geophysically relevant reynolds numbers 2 methodology 2 1 problem formulation and nondimensionalization the major physical processes providing energy to the currents that force oscillating turbulent bbls are surface waves in shallow zones internal waves along the thermocline and basin scale internal waves in lakes or tides in the ocean while the periods of surface waves are of the order of a few seconds internal waves evolve over time scales of 10 20 min with velocities of 0 1 m s 1 helfrich and melville 2006 boegman 2009 lorke and maclntyre 2009 near bottom currents in lakes are primarily generated by basin scale internal waves with typical periods of 1 10 days superimposed with other modes of oscillation similarly in coastal oceans the predominant tides have periods of 12 to 24 h therefore turbulent bbl oscillations can be a result of typical current velocities of 0 1 m s 1 and time scales of seconds to current velocities of a few cm s 1 and time scales of several hours to days lorke and maclntyre 2009 during storm conditions increased velocities are expected o 1 m s 1 these oscillations fig 1 can be characterized by the freestream velocity amplitude u 0 m and period t here asterisks denote dimensional variables this work focuses on the idealized case of a uniform zero mean freestream currents on a smooth flat wall with an oscillatory freestream velocity u u 0 m s i n where ω t represents the phase angle and ω 2 π t is the angular frequency of the oscillation the typical reynolds number in oscillating boundary layers studies is defined from a combination of three parameters u 0 m ω and ν the kinematic viscosity of the fluid as 1 r e δ s δ s u 0 m ν where δ s 2 ν ω is the stokes layer thickness spalart and baldwin 1988 the thus defined reynolds number eq 1 includes the amplitude of the freestream velocity and period of oscillation which define the flow regime of the oscillating bbl the δ s based reynolds number equals 2 r e a where r e a a u 0 m ν is the amplitude of the freestream motion a u 0 m ω in the laminar regime the deviation of velocity profiles from the steady case is confined to δ s previous research e g hino et al 1976 jensen et al 1989 spalart and baldwin 1988 verzicco and vittori 1996 has identified four flow regimes on the basis of the stokes reynolds number i fully laminar r e δ s 100 ii disturbed laminar characterized by the presence of small amplitude perturbations superimposed on the base stokes flow 100 r e δ s 550 iii intermittent turbulent where bursts are created during the deceleration phase of the cycle 550 r e δ s 1800 and iv fully developed turbulent where turbulence is present during most of the cycle 1800 r e δ s 3500 for r e δ s 3500 jensen et al 1989 observed a fully developed turbulent flow throughout the cycle fully developed turbulent regimes are characteristic of oceanographic environments e g thorpe 2005 flows with equal stokes reynolds numbers and similar bottom roughness i e equal non dimensional roughness a k s where k s is the nikuradse equivalent sand roughness possess the same turbulent properties therefore a solution for a specific reynolds number is relevant to a variety of flows with different velocities and periods fig 1 an oscillating flow driven by a high frequency internal wave with high velocity e g lake constance lorke 2007 is dynamically similar to one driven by an internal wave with low velocity and long period provided they have the same reynolds number e g lake alpnach bryant et al 2010 2 2 governing equations and numerical method we solved the dimensionless equations of conservation of mass and momentum 2 u j x j 0 3 u i t x j u i u j p x i 1 r e δ s 2 u i x j 2 δ i 1 f where x 1 x 2 and x 3 or x y and z are respectively the streamwise wall normal and spanwise or z directions and u i or u v w are the velocity components in those directions p is the pressure normalized by the density ρ and δ i j is the kronecker delta the flow was driven by a periodic pressure gradient f which resulted in a sinusoidal variation of the freestream in eqs 2 and 3 the velocities were normalized by u 0 m lengths by δ s and the time by δ s u 0 m here all unstarred quantities are nondimensional e g u u u 0 m and y y δ s for les the governing equations 2 3 were filtered leonard 1974 consequently the velocity and pressure were replaced by their filtered counterparts u i and p the contribution of the unresolved eddies to the momentum transport appears through the divergence of the subgrid scale stresses τ i j x i where τ i j u i u j u i u j a tilde represents the filtering operation used to separate the resolved from unresolved scales this term was modeled using an eddy viscosity approximation 4 τ i j δ i j 3 τ k k 2 ν t s i j in which ν t c e v

procedure germano et al 1991 lilly 1992 and δ δ x δ y δ z 1 3 is the filter width where δ x δ y and δ z are the grid spacings in the three coordinate directions simulations were carried out for r e δ s 20 800 1000 1800 and 3600 spanning the range from fully laminar flow to fully developed turbulent including the intermittent regime fig 1 the governing equations 2 and 3 were solved in a cartesian domain fig 2 the boundary conditions were periodic in the x and z directions with smooth top and the bottom boundaries that were free and no slip respectively the numerical model used to compute the flow is a well validated finite difference code based on a staggered grid e g keating et al 2004a b scalo et al 2012 yuan and piomelli 2014 second order central differences were used for both convective and diffusive terms with a crank nicolson time advancement scheme for the wall normal diffusive term and a low storage third order runge kutta for the other terms the parameters used in this study are summarized in table 1 the superscript indicates normalization by ν u τ where u τ τ w ρ is the friction velocity ρ is the density and τ w is the wall shear stress 2 3 logarithmic law of the wall log law the log law for the mean velocity profile is one of the most commonly adopted models for steady turbulent bbls 6 u l 1 κ l n y b l where κ 0 41 is the von karman constant b l 5 1 is a constant and y y u τ ν eq 6 is for smooth flows the log law is commonly applied to recover mean flow and dissipation profiles lorke and maclntyre 2009 in this study the error of this steady state model due to the intermittent and unsteady nature of turbulence in an oscillating bbl was assessed by comparing the dissipation and velocity distribution obtained from the log law with those obtained directly from les 2 4 stokes second problem for low reynolds numbers the solution to stokes second problem is often used to derive velocity profiles this is the solution of the navier stokes equations for the case of an infinite plate in which the freestream is subjected to a sinusoidal oscillation with frequency ω and maximum velocity u 0 m the resulting velocity profile is 7 u s u s u 0 m e y δ s c o s ω t y δ s c o s ω t although this solution is strictly for laminar flows it has been applied to oscillating bbls in lakes lorke et al 2002 in the following the accuracy of the velocity profile eq 7 over a range of r e δ s was quantified 2 5 boundary layer thickness to investigate the development of the boundary layer thickness for different reynolds numbers the edge of the boundary layer at each phase δ was defined as the point where u u 0 01 u 0 m note that u is the freestream velocity at each phase which equals u 0 m at 90 scotti and piomelli 2001 proposed the use of a turbulent stokes length 8 δ t 2 ν ν t ω 1 2 in which the turbulent eddy viscosity was added to the kinematic viscosity to include the effects of the turbulent transport on the development of the bbl thickness ω ω δ s u 0 m this definition has the obvious advantage that the resulting thickness is time dependent through the effect of the eddy viscosity while the stokes length δ is not to verify whether turbulent transport is sufficient to account for the bbl thickness development it was tested by replacing the eddy viscosity with its exact value obtained from the les or dns 9 ν t e x u v u y which was averaged over the bbl thickness known from the simulation while this test is not predictive it helps highlight whether the important mechanisms that govern the bbl development can be accounted for with a simple eddy viscosity concept 2 6 dissipation and production of turbulent kinetic energy the dissipation and production p from the numerical data were computed directly from the definitions 10 ε 2 ν u i x j u i x j p u i u j u i y where u i are the velocity fluctuations and ε and p are normalized by u 0 m 3 δ s for the les ν is replaced by the total viscosity ν ν t here the angled brackets denote averaging over the homogeneous directions x and z we compare the direct calculation of dissipation from les with log law and idm estimates that are commonly applied to field data and require an assumption that the flow is steady homogeneous and isotropic e g doron et al 2001 lorke et al 2003 lorke 2007 log law assumes a balance between production and dissipation 11 ε u τ 3 κ y the idm is based on fitting the energy spectrum e to the theoretical form within the inertial subrange at high reynolds number where the turbulence is isotropic kolmogorov s universal equilibrium hypothesis the one dimensional energy spectrum takes the form 12 e β β α β β ε 2 3 k 5 3 where β β 1 2 3 represents the streamwise spanwise and vertical directions k is the wavenumber and α β β 0 5 is the canonical kolmogorov 5 3 constant monina and yagloma 1975 here we apply the idm on the streamwise velocity components using the canonical constant 3 dns and les model results 3 1 bottom boundary layer evolution the ratio of boundary layer thickness to stokes layer δ δ s increases with the reynolds number from 18 for r e δ s 800 to 42 for r e δ s 3600 fig 3 the bbl grows until the later stages of deceleration 150 ϕ 170 where the turbulent layer reaches the maximum thickness gayen et al 2010 comparison of the turbulent stokes length with a proportionality constant of 4 5 obtained by fitting 8 to the exact value with the boundary layer thickness from velocity profiles fig 3 indicates that the eddy viscosity concept can be useful in explaining the bbl development as the temporal variations of its thickness were captured with generally 10 error 3 2 turbulent production and dissipation contours of non dimensional dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy ε eq 10 and the ratio of turbulent production to dissipation ε p eq 10 are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively with increasing reynolds number the production and dissipation of turbulent energy occur at greater distances from the wall due to dispersion of the strong turbulence originating near the bottom boundary hino et al 1983 salon et al 2007 as a result the thickness of the turbulent boundary layer increases with increased r e δ s in accordance with previous experimental observations hino et al 1983 sleath 1987 akhavan et al 1991a and numerical results akhavan et al 1991b vittori and verzicco 1998 the strongest turbulent production and dissipation occur in the early phases of deceleration close to the bed at lower reynolds numbers e g 90 for r e δ s 800 at y 5 while strong turbulence generation occurs during the entire cycle for highly turbulent flows for r e δ s 3600 at y 5 turbulent production and dissipation begin from the early phase of acceleration 25 and continue until the last phase of deceleration 170 fig 4 a balance between shear production and dissipation is a common assumption in geophysical flows for calculating parameters such as bed shear stress and diapycnal diffusivity from observed data osborn 1980 ivey and imberger 1991 holtappels and lorke 2011 local equilibrium between dissipation and production close to the wall fig 5 was limited to phases immediately after the beginning of the acceleration and the late stages of deceleration figs 4 and 5 show an appreciable vertical inhomogeneity in turbulent dissipation due to this phase difference in the water column which results from turbulent energy dispersion generated at the bottom the local equilibrium between dissipation and production happens at later away from the wall compared to closer to the bottom boundary for earlier phases e g 180 at y 10 for r e δ s 800 fig 5a for fully turbulent flows the magnitude of turbulent production can be as high as twice the dissipation fig 5 high ratios of production to dissipation in the late stages of acceleration and early stages of deceleration near the wall result from turbulent bursts akhavan et al 1991b therefore the equilibrium assumption is not valid for most phases of oscillation this can affect the accuracy of calculations of quantities such as bed shear stress perlin et al 2005 and diapycnal diffusivity lorke 2007 from field measurements 3 3 boundary layer integrated dissipation significant energy dissipation and diapycnal mixing occur in the oscillatory bbls of lakes and oceans e g munk 1966 polzin et al 1997 for example observations show that 70 of the internal kelvin wave energy in lake geneva bouffard and lemmin 2013 72 of the internal poincaré wave energy in lake erie bouffard et al 2012 and 90 of the basin scale internal wave energy in lake alpnach wüest et al 2000 and lake biwa imberger 1998 happens in bbls tracer studies in coastal seas holtermann et al 2012 and oceanic basins ledwell and bratkovich 1995a ledwell and hickey 1995b also indicate that diapycnal mixing is greater near the boundary therefore there is a need to model and parameterize this turbulence to close energy budgets wüest et al 2000 bouffard et al 2012 fig 6a and b show the dissipation integrated over the bbl at different phases of oscillation and the integrated dissipation over the bbl through one cycle e ρ t 0 360 0 δ ε d y d φ respectively for different reynolds numbers as expected tennekes and lumley 1972 the integrated dissipation increases with reynolds number and the regression fig 6b r 2 0 84 provides a measure to estimate dissipation in an oscillating geophysical boundary layer table 2 the present simulations were limited to r e δ s 4000 however the model predictions compare well with field observations at higher reynolds number e g the integrated dissipation from the viscous sublayer to logarithmic layer thickness in lake alpnach 1 5 10 4 w m 2 wüest et al 2000 is within 20 of that predicted from fig 6a 1 26 10 4 w m 2 and e 2 1 10 4 w m 2 through the thermocline and hypolimnion of central lake erie r e δ s 28000 over one poincaré wave period bouffard et al 2012 is comparable with 1 1 10 4 w m 2 from the linear regression prediction fig 6b table 2 4 analytical model validation 4 1 logarithmic law of the wall log law in field studies mean flow profiles are often measured and bbl turbulence is then modeled using the log law e g lueck and lu 1998 lorke et al 2002 wu et al 2011 which provides bed shear stress and dissipation it was however recognized by jensen et al 1989 that the logarithmic law only holds through part of the oscillatory cycle which increases with reynolds number hino et al 1983 showed experimentally that turbulence is generated following the violent collapse of a shear layer near the boundary this is shown in fig 7a in which the rms deviation of the velocity profile from the log law e l eq 6 is within 50 y 110 in agreement with jensen et al 1989 for low reynolds number oscillating flows r e δ s 550 the logarithmic profile was more accurate in the later stage of the acceleration phase ϕ 70 to 110 with error greater than 5 throughout the cycle fig 7a highly turbulent flows r e δ s 3000 follow the log law with error less than 2 and the agreement is best for the highest reynolds number r e δ s 3600 jensen et al 1989 radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 4 2 stokes second problem the solution to stokes second problem eq 7 has also been used to infer the velocity profile from field measurements e g lorke et al 2002 the rms error with height for stokes second problem e s was evaluated in fig 7b the error was less than 10 for r e δ s 500 and approached 40 through the intermittent turbulent regime r e δ s 1000 for turbulent flows r e δ s 2000 stokes second problem became inapplicable through most of the cycle due to the predominance of turbulent transport over molecular transport the latter of which is the only mechanism accounted for in eq 7 5 application of models to field data field instruments have limitations in spatial and temporal sampling of bbls e g jabbari et al 2020 consequently models e g log law and stokes second problem have been applied to calculate indirectly the kinematics of bbls and interpolate observed results in space and time e g lorke et al 2002 mcginnis et al 2014 jabbari et al 2019 to test the applicability of models used in the literature to predict oscillatory bbl dynamics at field scale the simulation results from this work were compared to those from the models the goal was not to validate the model with published field data but rather to design an idealized companion dns les to determine model veracity this allowed for the generation of self consistent and geophysically relevant data to assist the development of algebraic models of bbl dynamics which are needed in field scale applications 5 1 lake currents lake alpnach is elliptical in shape and is a medium sized 4 76 km2 sub basin of lake lucerne located in central switzerland the les model used in this study has been shown to be successful in reproducing the oscillating flow in lake alpnach scalo et al 2013 accurately reproduced the observed current 10 cm above the bed in 2007 observations at r e δ s 2200 bryant et al 2010 here we compare to current velocities measured by lorke et al 2003 and lorke and wüest 2005 at a mid lake site with a local depth of 32 2 m for 25 h on 13 14 august 2002 using a four beam rdi workhorse adcp with a bin size of 0 1 m enabling a measurement range from 0 6 to 8 1 m above the bed and a three beam nortek ndp with a vertical bin size of 0 04 m resolving the range from 0 05 to 2 2 m above the sediment due to the surrounding mountainous topography there was a diurnal wind stress lake breeze along the main axis that causes strong seiching that generated an oscillatory bbl münnich et al 1992 gloor et al 2000 consequently lake alpnach has been an ideal site for research on internal waves bbl dynamics turbulence and mixing lorke et al 2002 2003 2005 lorke and wüest 2005 bryant et al 2010 becherer and umlauf 2011 the seiche driven horizontal currents exhibited a period of 18 h and the maximum measured velocity at 1 m above the bed was 27 mm s 1 this period is associated with the first horizontal second vertical mode internal seiche in the lake münnich et al 1992 from the period of the current and the velocity profiles figs 8a and 9 r e δ s 3880 which is close to the highest reynolds number computed in this study hence the field measurements were compared with the les results for r e δ s 3600 our simulations and those by scalo et al 2013 assumed a hydraulically smooth bed as is typical in the literature for geophysical les dns e g diamessis and redekopp 2006 aghsaee et al 2010 arthur and fringer 2014 lamb 2014 xu and stastna 2020 this computational simplification will introduce error considering that k s 0 014 m lorke et al 2002 and u τ m a x 1 3 10 3 ms 1 lorke et al 2003 giving a roughness reynolds number k s k s u τ m a x ν was 18 which is in the transitionally rough regime but not the fully rough regime i e k s 30 while it is beyond the scope of the present study to investigate the errors associated with using a smooth boundary for modeling a transitional regime future research should consider bottom roughness effects e g radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 the time series of observed mean current speeds 1 m above the bed were evaluated against the simulations fig 8a current measurements revealed higher levels of variance during periods of high velocity associated with enhanced turbulence this may be due to the differences between the simulations and the observed conditions i the forcing the current velocity fig 8a used in the simulations was only an approximate match of the observations ii the simulations were performed for a large number of cycles until periodic steady state whereas the field measurements represent a single cycle preceded by a different history and iii turbulence fig 8b and velocity fig 9 measurements have large uncertainties as will be discussed later fig 9 compares velocity profiles obtained from adcp measurements and les at two different times there are distinct current maxima typical of an oscillatory stokes velocity profile lorke et al 2003 the amplitude of these maxima decreases gradually with distance from the bed schlichting 1962 this feature is more obvious in the profile measured at 09 30 h fig 9b from the observations reproduced in fig 9b lorke et al 2002 estimated that the logarithmic boundary layer was restricted to the lowest 0 5 m above the sediment les velocity profiles were compared with log law extracted from the les fig 9 the logarithmic region was 1 m from the bed during strong turbulence ϕ 270 fig 9b whereas during weak turbulence ϕ 220 fig 9a the logarithmic region was 0 25 m from the bed during the earlier phases of oscillation the logarithmic layer does not exist since the boundary layer is not sufficiently thick to house the log layer jensen et al 1989 the log layer grows during the later phases when the flow reaches a fully turbulent state baroclinic and barotropic flows are believed to cause deviation from log law behavior outside the bbl lorke et al 2002 valipour et al 2015 consequently as initially reported in jensen et al 1989 application of the log law at greater heights is not valid the log law substantially over predicts the velocity profile obtained from the les away from the bed and predicts monotonic behavior that does not match the flow physics during the acceleration phase jensen et al 1989 jabbari et al 2020 5 2 rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy methods to compute energy dissipation from field data usually require assumptions that flow is steady homogeneous and isotropic doron et al 2001 lorke et al 2003 lorke 2007 jabbari et al 2015 2016 since these assumptions rarely apply in realistic cases the results may be inaccurate by applying several methods to compute dissipation from field data in the bottom boundary layer of lake erie jabbari et al 2020 showed that depending on the method used variations in the observed ε can be 1 or 2 orders of magnitude here we employ les fig 8c to assess error in computing ε using observational methods and compare these calculations to published dissipation observations from lake alpnach lorke and wüest 2005 the methods to compute ε from observations include fitting temperature microstructure profiles to the batchelor spectrum tmm or wavenumber time series to the kolmogorov spectrum in the inertial subrange idm density stratification may suppress turbulent overturns greater than the ozmidov scale becherer and umlauf 2011 umlauf et al 2015 however the field measurements from lake alpnach were during weak stratification n 2 10 5 s 2 average n 2 3 10 6 s 2 where n is the buoyancy frequency considering an average dissipation 10 9 w kg 1 fig 8c the ratio of the ozmidov length scale l 0 ε n 3 1 2 to kolmogorov length scale η ν 3 ε 1 4 i l 0 η ε ν n 2 3 4 was 80 which is much less than the 3000 required for stratification to impact turbulence bluteau et al 2011 fig 8b compares time series of ε 1 m above the sediment from i the three published experimental methods tmm and idm from 2 adcps lorke and wüest 2005 ii the log law based estimation eq 11 in which the dissipation was calculated using u τ from the les iii the dissipation was computed applying the idm method to the les time series eq 12 and iv the dissipation was calculated directly from the les eq 10 in all methods the turbulence followed the same periodic structure as the current velocity fig 8a and b there was a phase lag of 1 to 2 h between the seiche induced current and the turbulent energy dissipation in the les fig 8a and b which was also observed by lorke et al 2002 resulting from the seiche induced periodicity of the flow causing a local temporal imbalance between production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation from the field measurements and les calculations wascompared with those obtained from the log law computed from the les data figs 8b and 10 the tmm had very low dissipation 10 11 and 10 10 w kg 1 during the weak turbulence phases fig 10a and c these are at the noise floor for tmm measurements lorke et al 2003 and indicate nearly laminar flow lorke and wüest 2005 also give a noise floor detection limit of the automated estimation procedure for the rdi computed idm dissipation at 4 10 10 w kg 1 therefore the majority of the rdi dissipation estimates in fig 10c are noise with the exception of those near the bed the dissipation computed from log law was reasonable 47 error at 1 m fig 8b during the turbulent phases agreement was poorer in comparison to both observations and the direct les dissipation during the flow reversal and in the early phases of acceleration e g log law underestimates the dissipation by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude between 06 00 and 08 30 at 1 m above the bed fig 8b this was because the flow condition did not satisfy the idealized assumptions of stationary and fully developed turbulence these results were similar to observations from lakes with similar boundary layer dynamics for example in lake michigan near bed turbulence agreed with log law on average but individual estimates deviated substantially cannon and troy 2018 in lake erie dissipation from log law typically exceeded that from other methods particularly near the bed and during peak current velocities jabbari et al 2020 and in lake alpnach log law and tmm dissipation estimates both showed the same temporal pattern but that from log law was 2 orders of magnitude greater and 1 5 h ahead in phase relative to tmm lorke et al 2002 to assess the accuracy of the idm the dissipation was also calculated by applying the idm to wavenumber spectra of the streamwise velocity component from the les figs 8b and 10 the idm is ideally applied to homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows with high reynolds number bluteau et al 2011 jabbari et al 2020 these conditions were not fulfilled during all phases of the oscillatory cycle resulting considerable error in prediction of dissipation e g over 0 ϕ 20 fig 10c the idm dissipation at 1 m above the bed is 2 times less than the les there was a better agreement between les and idm when the oscillation was in the turbulent phases e g at ϕ 270 in fig 10b in general the idm was more accurate than log law in computing ε even through the strong turbulence phases e g at 09 30 h fig 10b this error indicates that despite the high reynolds number and the long forcing period 18 h the assumption of local equilibrium between production and dissipation does not hold by assuming a quasi steady state significant error results the idm also assumes that the flow is homogeneous and isotropic therefore one would expect similar errors to occur however when using the les data the idm is more accurate than the log law estimate this may be due to the log law being based on an equilibrium between dissipation and production which occurs in larger eddies near the boundary large eddies are more anisotropic and so equilibrium is rare the idm on the other hand is based on the spectrum in the inertial subrange which considers eddies much smaller than the integral scale whose timescales are shorter making them more likely to be homogeneous and isotropic than the larger energy containing eddies responsible for production by applying different methods to compute dissipation we may evaluate methodological and measurements error as well as uncertainties in the idealized simulations figs 8b and 10 in general the errors between les vs idm dissipation and even les vs log law i e methodological errors were significantly smaller than the scatter of the field data using the same method i e measurement errors e g 1 to 2 order of magnitude difference between idm applied to rdi and nortek measurements fig 8b specifically the uncertainty between field observations measurement errors methodological errors was 2 order of magnitude during the early phases of acceleration before the turbulent phase e g 3 order of magnitude difference between tmm and idm applied to rdi and nortek at 07 30 fig 8b this was noticeably greater than the difference between the direct les dissipation and the average field measurements generally 1 order of magnitude fig 8b that can be attributed to the differences between the idealized numerical setup and the observational conditions i e currents in fig 8a the periodic steady state nature of les and or measurement error in the field 6 conclusions idealized dns and les of oscillating bbl flows that occur in lakes and coastal oceans were performed to test the applicability of bbls models log law and stokes second problem to reproduce the associated flow kinematics for laminar oscillating flows r e δ s 550 the applicability of the log law in reproducing velocity profiles was limited to the early turbulent phases whereas for fully turbulent flows r e δ s 3000 the log law was reasonably accurate in most phases with 2 error the laminar solution of stokes second problem was only applicable in reproducing velocity profiles in the laminar regimes and gave errors 40 for r e δ s 1000 application of different models to lake currents shows that the dissipation obtained from the log law was similar to the les data at 1 m above the bed during turbulent phases but the errors were large 1 order of magnitude when the flow reverses the idm applied to the les data showed better accuracy than the log law especially during the weak turbulence of the acceleration phase in an oscillatory bbl cycle when homogeneous and isotropic conditions are less likely to occur the error associated with applying the equilibrium assumption to an oscillatory flow is therefore more significant than those resulting from anisotropy the error in computing dissipation when applying log law and idm to les data methodological error significantly less than the large scatter in dissipation from different observational methods and instruments suggesting that measurement error as opposed to methodological error predominates when computing observed dissipation in oscillatory bbl flows thus more research is required to assess the accuracy of acoustic

23914,oscillating turbulent bottom boundary layers bbls occur in lakes and coastal oceans at the mesoscale level their kinematics are usually characterized by assuming either laminar or steady turbulent flow and applying analytical solutions or semi empirical correlations e g log law stokes second problem inertial dissipation method idm batchelor fitting to temperature microstructure method tmm to investigate the ability of these models to capture oscillating turbulent bbls we have performed large eddy simulations les and direct numerical simulations dns for reynolds numbers r e δ s based on the stokes layer thickness between 20 and 3600 the velocity profiles showed logarithmic behavior throughout the cycle in fully turbulent flows error less than 2 for r e δ s 3000 but the log law was only accurate during turbulent bursts in the later stage of the acceleration phase for r e δ s 550 stokes second problem predicted the velocity profile in laminar or disturbed laminar flow errors less than 10 for r e δ s 500 at high reynolds number r e δ s 3600 les shows that the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy from the idm is more accurate than that from the log law particularly during changes in flow direction the difference between the dissipation estimated from field observations using idm and tmm and from idealized les however suggest that measurement errors may predominate over uncertainties in simulation of boundary conditions and methodological errors in field applications keywords water currents flow measurement bottom boundary layer turbulence energy dissipation numerical models 1 introduction the flow in the bottom boundary layer bbl of lakes and coastal oceans is typically oscillating due to surface waves internal waves along the thermocline and tides the dynamics of oscillating turbulent bbls are of significant importance to understand mixing and transport processes strong turbulence production and mixing in turbulent bbls results in enhanced vertical transport of mass and momentum on basin scales munk 1966 imberger 1998 ivey and nokes 1989 the ability to characterize bbls is required to parameterize the bottom drag in hydrodynamic models boegman et al 2001 bourgault et al 2014 the turbulent bbl thickness in energy budgets wüest et al 2000 bouffard et al 2012 the occurrence of sediment re suspension hosegood and van haren 2004 valipour et al 2017 boegman and stastna 2019 and the mass flux across the sediment water interface scalo et al 2013 mcginnis et al 2014 however there are no analytical models for oscillating turbulent bbls and direct measurement of the kinematics such as bbl thickness velocity profile and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy ε of turbulent bbls in lakes and coastal oceans remains difficult lorke et al 2002 scalo et al 2013 jabbari et al 2015 2016 2020 the kinematics of oscillating bbls may be analytically derived from field data by assuming i steady turbulent logarithmic law of the wall log law behavior or ii oscillating laminar stokes second problem behavior however field observations lorke 2007 mellor 2002 and laboratory experiments jensen et al 1989 show that in the case of low current velocities turbulence in an oscillatory bbl can become intermittent and unsteady and consequently the log law does not always apply for example ackerman et al 2001 were only able to fit the log law to observed velocity profiles in western lake erie 1 5 1 7 of the time where a log law flow was expected from the strong barotropic seiche currents e g boegman et al 2001 and the bbl forced by low speed oscillatory currents in lake alpnach lorke et al 2002 has significant scatter of both friction velocity and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation relative to log law predictions the non equilibrium turbulence associated with an oscillatory flow likely causes the deviation from log law behavior lorke et al 2002 mellor 2002 on the other hand stokes second problem applies to laminar flow applying it to characterize turbulent environmental bbls results in inaccuracies in modeling the velocity distribution and turbulent viscosity lorke et al 2002 furthermore the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy in field studies which enables parameterization of turbulent mixing and biogeochemical fluxes e g lorke 2007 bouffard and lemmin 2013 is typically calculated from the theoretical methods such as inertial dissipation method idm or the temperature microstructure method tmm using batchelor fitting these methods rely on the assumption of steady isotropic and homogeneous turbulence that do not apply in the boundary layers jabbari et al 2015 2016 therefore in addition to measurement errors the estimation from these methods can include methodological errors hence there remains a need to investigate comprehensively the applicability of the analytical and theoretical models to predict the kinematics of oscillating bbls in lakes and coastal oceans and evaluate existing and new models that allow the prediction of flow characteristics based on readily observed flow variables computational models have contributed widely to the understanding of oscillating flows direct numerical simulations dns e g spalart and baldwin 1988 have focused on the disturbed laminar and intermittently turbulent regimes and presented a high reynolds number theory for wall stress and freestream velocity profiles large eddy simulations les have extended oscillating flow studies to higher reynolds numbers in the fully turbulent regime radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 hsu et al 2000 captured the transition to the intermittent turbulent regime as well as the phase lag between the wall shear stress and the freestream oscillations for turbulent oscillating flows many other numerical studies e g salon et al 2007 have reproduced the oscillating bbl experiments by jensen et al 1989 rather than model the bbl with a reynolds averaged model requiring turbulence closure and a bottom drag parameterization e g umlauf et al 2015 we apply wall resolved les and dns the present study focuses on the difficulty in measuring and analytically modeling the kinematics of oscillating turbulent bbls in lakes and coastal oceans the objectives are to i assess the accuracy of the analytical models log law and stokes second problem for the prediction of turbulent oscillating geophysical bbls boundary layer thickness turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and reynolds shear stresses against a high fidelity dns and les database of oscillating boundary layer flows ranging from laminar to fully turbulent and ii develop new nondimensional models from the dns and les data which may be used to characterize oscillating turbulent bbls at geophysically relevant reynolds numbers 2 methodology 2 1 problem formulation and nondimensionalization the major physical processes providing energy to the currents that force oscillating turbulent bbls are surface waves in shallow zones internal waves along the thermocline and basin scale internal waves in lakes or tides in the ocean while the periods of surface waves are of the order of a few seconds internal waves evolve over time scales of 10 20 min with velocities of 0 1 m s 1 helfrich and melville 2006 boegman 2009 lorke and maclntyre 2009 near bottom currents in lakes are primarily generated by basin scale internal waves with typical periods of 1 10 days superimposed with other modes of oscillation similarly in coastal oceans the predominant tides have periods of 12 to 24 h therefore turbulent bbl oscillations can be a result of typical current velocities of 0 1 m s 1 and time scales of seconds to current velocities of a few cm s 1 and time scales of several hours to days lorke and maclntyre 2009 during storm conditions increased velocities are expected o 1 m s 1 these oscillations fig 1 can be characterized by the freestream velocity amplitude u 0 m and period t here asterisks denote dimensional variables this work focuses on the idealized case of a uniform zero mean freestream currents on a smooth flat wall with an oscillatory freestream velocity u u 0 m s i n where ω t represents the phase angle and ω 2 π t is the angular frequency of the oscillation the typical reynolds number in oscillating boundary layers studies is defined from a combination of three parameters u 0 m ω and ν the kinematic viscosity of the fluid as 1 r e δ s δ s u 0 m ν where δ s 2 ν ω is the stokes layer thickness spalart and baldwin 1988 the thus defined reynolds number eq 1 includes the amplitude of the freestream velocity and period of oscillation which define the flow regime of the oscillating bbl the δ s based reynolds number equals 2 r e a where r e a a u 0 m ν is the amplitude of the freestream motion a u 0 m ω in the laminar regime the deviation of velocity profiles from the steady case is confined to δ s previous research e g hino et al 1976 jensen et al 1989 spalart and baldwin 1988 verzicco and vittori 1996 has identified four flow regimes on the basis of the stokes reynolds number i fully laminar r e δ s 100 ii disturbed laminar characterized by the presence of small amplitude perturbations superimposed on the base stokes flow 100 r e δ s 550 iii intermittent turbulent where bursts are created during the deceleration phase of the cycle 550 r e δ s 1800 and iv fully developed turbulent where turbulence is present during most of the cycle 1800 r e δ s 3500 for r e δ s 3500 jensen et al 1989 observed a fully developed turbulent flow throughout the cycle fully developed turbulent regimes are characteristic of oceanographic environments e g thorpe 2005 flows with equal stokes reynolds numbers and similar bottom roughness i e equal non dimensional roughness a k s where k s is the nikuradse equivalent sand roughness possess the same turbulent properties therefore a solution for a specific reynolds number is relevant to a variety of flows with different velocities and periods fig 1 an oscillating flow driven by a high frequency internal wave with high velocity e g lake constance lorke 2007 is dynamically similar to one driven by an internal wave with low velocity and long period provided they have the same reynolds number e g lake alpnach bryant et al 2010 2 2 governing equations and numerical method we solved the dimensionless equations of conservation of mass and momentum 2 u j x j 0 3 u i t x j u i u j p x i 1 r e δ s 2 u i x j 2 δ i 1 f where x 1 x 2 and x 3 or x y and z are respectively the streamwise wall normal and spanwise or z directions and u i or u v w are the velocity components in those directions p is the pressure normalized by the density ρ and δ i j is the kronecker delta the flow was driven by a periodic pressure gradient f which resulted in a sinusoidal variation of the freestream in eqs 2 and 3 the velocities were normalized by u 0 m lengths by δ s and the time by δ s u 0 m here all unstarred quantities are nondimensional e g u u u 0 m and y y δ s for les the governing equations 2 3 were filtered leonard 1974 consequently the velocity and pressure were replaced by their filtered counterparts u i and p the contribution of the unresolved eddies to the momentum transport appears through the divergence of the subgrid scale stresses τ i j x i where τ i j u i u j u i u j a tilde represents the filtering operation used to separate the resolved from unresolved scales this term was modeled using an eddy viscosity approximation 4 τ i j δ i j 3 τ k k 2 ν t s i j in which ν t c e v δ 2 s is the eddy viscosity s i j is the filtered strain rate tensor 5 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and s 2 s i j s i j 1 2 is its magnitude the coefficient c e v was evaluated using the dynamic procedure germano et al 1991 lilly 1992 and δ δ x δ y δ z 1 3 is the filter width where δ x δ y and δ z are the grid spacings in the three coordinate directions simulations were carried out for r e δ s 20 800 1000 1800 and 3600 spanning the range from fully laminar flow to fully developed turbulent including the intermittent regime fig 1 the governing equations 2 and 3 were solved in a cartesian domain fig 2 the boundary conditions were periodic in the x and z directions with smooth top and the bottom boundaries that were free and no slip respectively the numerical model used to compute the flow is a well validated finite difference code based on a staggered grid e g keating et al 2004a b scalo et al 2012 yuan and piomelli 2014 second order central differences were used for both convective and diffusive terms with a crank nicolson time advancement scheme for the wall normal diffusive term and a low storage third order runge kutta for the other terms the parameters used in this study are summarized in table 1 the superscript indicates normalization by ν u τ where u τ τ w ρ is the friction velocity ρ is the density and τ w is the wall shear stress 2 3 logarithmic law of the wall log law the log law for the mean velocity profile is one of the most commonly adopted models for steady turbulent bbls 6 u l 1 κ l n y b l where κ 0 41 is the von karman constant b l 5 1 is a constant and y y u τ ν eq 6 is for smooth flows the log law is commonly applied to recover mean flow and dissipation profiles lorke and maclntyre 2009 in this study the error of this steady state model due to the intermittent and unsteady nature of turbulence in an oscillating bbl was assessed by comparing the dissipation and velocity distribution obtained from the log law with those obtained directly from les 2 4 stokes second problem for low reynolds numbers the solution to stokes second problem is often used to derive velocity profiles this is the solution of the navier stokes equations for the case of an infinite plate in which the freestream is subjected to a sinusoidal oscillation with frequency ω and maximum velocity u 0 m the resulting velocity profile is 7 u s u s u 0 m e y δ s c o s ω t y δ s c o s ω t although this solution is strictly for laminar flows it has been applied to oscillating bbls in lakes lorke et al 2002 in the following the accuracy of the velocity profile eq 7 over a range of r e δ s was quantified 2 5 boundary layer thickness to investigate the development of the boundary layer thickness for different reynolds numbers the edge of the boundary layer at each phase δ was defined as the point where u u 0 01 u 0 m note that u is the freestream velocity at each phase which equals u 0 m at 90 scotti and piomelli 2001 proposed the use of a turbulent stokes length 8 δ t 2 ν ν t ω 1 2 in which the turbulent eddy viscosity was added to the kinematic viscosity to include the effects of the turbulent transport on the development of the bbl thickness ω ω δ s u 0 m this definition has the obvious advantage that the resulting thickness is time dependent through the effect of the eddy viscosity while the stokes length δ is not to verify whether turbulent transport is sufficient to account for the bbl thickness development it was tested by replacing the eddy viscosity with its exact value obtained from the les or dns 9 ν t e x u v u y which was averaged over the bbl thickness known from the simulation while this test is not predictive it helps highlight whether the important mechanisms that govern the bbl development can be accounted for with a simple eddy viscosity concept 2 6 dissipation and production of turbulent kinetic energy the dissipation and production p from the numerical data were computed directly from the definitions 10 ε 2 ν u i x j u i x j p u i u j u i y where u i are the velocity fluctuations and ε and p are normalized by u 0 m 3 δ s for the les ν is replaced by the total viscosity ν ν t here the angled brackets denote averaging over the homogeneous directions x and z we compare the direct calculation of dissipation from les with log law and idm estimates that are commonly applied to field data and require an assumption that the flow is steady homogeneous and isotropic e g doron et al 2001 lorke et al 2003 lorke 2007 log law assumes a balance between production and dissipation 11 ε u τ 3 κ y the idm is based on fitting the energy spectrum e to the theoretical form within the inertial subrange at high reynolds number where the turbulence is isotropic kolmogorov s universal equilibrium hypothesis the one dimensional energy spectrum takes the form 12 e β β α β β ε 2 3 k 5 3 where β β 1 2 3 represents the streamwise spanwise and vertical directions k is the wavenumber and α β β 0 5 is the canonical kolmogorov 5 3 constant monina and yagloma 1975 here we apply the idm on the streamwise velocity components using the canonical constant 3 dns and les model results 3 1 bottom boundary layer evolution the ratio of boundary layer thickness to stokes layer δ δ s increases with the reynolds number from 18 for r e δ s 800 to 42 for r e δ s 3600 fig 3 the bbl grows until the later stages of deceleration 150 ϕ 170 where the turbulent layer reaches the maximum thickness gayen et al 2010 comparison of the turbulent stokes length with a proportionality constant of 4 5 obtained by fitting 8 to the exact value with the boundary layer thickness from velocity profiles fig 3 indicates that the eddy viscosity concept can be useful in explaining the bbl development as the temporal variations of its thickness were captured with generally 10 error 3 2 turbulent production and dissipation contours of non dimensional dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy ε eq 10 and the ratio of turbulent production to dissipation ε p eq 10 are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively with increasing reynolds number the production and dissipation of turbulent energy occur at greater distances from the wall due to dispersion of the strong turbulence originating near the bottom boundary hino et al 1983 salon et al 2007 as a result the thickness of the turbulent boundary layer increases with increased r e δ s in accordance with previous experimental observations hino et al 1983 sleath 1987 akhavan et al 1991a and numerical results akhavan et al 1991b vittori and verzicco 1998 the strongest turbulent production and dissipation occur in the early phases of deceleration close to the bed at lower reynolds numbers e g 90 for r e δ s 800 at y 5 while strong turbulence generation occurs during the entire cycle for highly turbulent flows for r e δ s 3600 at y 5 turbulent production and dissipation begin from the early phase of acceleration 25 and continue until the last phase of deceleration 170 fig 4 a balance between shear production and dissipation is a common assumption in geophysical flows for calculating parameters such as bed shear stress and diapycnal diffusivity from observed data osborn 1980 ivey and imberger 1991 holtappels and lorke 2011 local equilibrium between dissipation and production close to the wall fig 5 was limited to phases immediately after the beginning of the acceleration and the late stages of deceleration figs 4 and 5 show an appreciable vertical inhomogeneity in turbulent dissipation due to this phase difference in the water column which results from turbulent energy dispersion generated at the bottom the local equilibrium between dissipation and production happens at later away from the wall compared to closer to the bottom boundary for earlier phases e g 180 at y 10 for r e δ s 800 fig 5a for fully turbulent flows the magnitude of turbulent production can be as high as twice the dissipation fig 5 high ratios of production to dissipation in the late stages of acceleration and early stages of deceleration near the wall result from turbulent bursts akhavan et al 1991b therefore the equilibrium assumption is not valid for most phases of oscillation this can affect the accuracy of calculations of quantities such as bed shear stress perlin et al 2005 and diapycnal diffusivity lorke 2007 from field measurements 3 3 boundary layer integrated dissipation significant energy dissipation and diapycnal mixing occur in the oscillatory bbls of lakes and oceans e g munk 1966 polzin et al 1997 for example observations show that 70 of the internal kelvin wave energy in lake geneva bouffard and lemmin 2013 72 of the internal poincaré wave energy in lake erie bouffard et al 2012 and 90 of the basin scale internal wave energy in lake alpnach wüest et al 2000 and lake biwa imberger 1998 happens in bbls tracer studies in coastal seas holtermann et al 2012 and oceanic basins ledwell and bratkovich 1995a ledwell and hickey 1995b also indicate that diapycnal mixing is greater near the boundary therefore there is a need to model and parameterize this turbulence to close energy budgets wüest et al 2000 bouffard et al 2012 fig 6a and b show the dissipation integrated over the bbl at different phases of oscillation and the integrated dissipation over the bbl through one cycle e ρ t 0 360 0 δ ε d y d φ respectively for different reynolds numbers as expected tennekes and lumley 1972 the integrated dissipation increases with reynolds number and the regression fig 6b r 2 0 84 provides a measure to estimate dissipation in an oscillating geophysical boundary layer table 2 the present simulations were limited to r e δ s 4000 however the model predictions compare well with field observations at higher reynolds number e g the integrated dissipation from the viscous sublayer to logarithmic layer thickness in lake alpnach 1 5 10 4 w m 2 wüest et al 2000 is within 20 of that predicted from fig 6a 1 26 10 4 w m 2 and e 2 1 10 4 w m 2 through the thermocline and hypolimnion of central lake erie r e δ s 28000 over one poincaré wave period bouffard et al 2012 is comparable with 1 1 10 4 w m 2 from the linear regression prediction fig 6b table 2 4 analytical model validation 4 1 logarithmic law of the wall log law in field studies mean flow profiles are often measured and bbl turbulence is then modeled using the log law e g lueck and lu 1998 lorke et al 2002 wu et al 2011 which provides bed shear stress and dissipation it was however recognized by jensen et al 1989 that the logarithmic law only holds through part of the oscillatory cycle which increases with reynolds number hino et al 1983 showed experimentally that turbulence is generated following the violent collapse of a shear layer near the boundary this is shown in fig 7a in which the rms deviation of the velocity profile from the log law e l eq 6 is within 50 y 110 in agreement with jensen et al 1989 for low reynolds number oscillating flows r e δ s 550 the logarithmic profile was more accurate in the later stage of the acceleration phase ϕ 70 to 110 with error greater than 5 throughout the cycle fig 7a highly turbulent flows r e δ s 3000 follow the log law with error less than 2 and the agreement is best for the highest reynolds number r e δ s 3600 jensen et al 1989 radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 4 2 stokes second problem the solution to stokes second problem eq 7 has also been used to infer the velocity profile from field measurements e g lorke et al 2002 the rms error with height for stokes second problem e s was evaluated in fig 7b the error was less than 10 for r e δ s 500 and approached 40 through the intermittent turbulent regime r e δ s 1000 for turbulent flows r e δ s 2000 stokes second problem became inapplicable through most of the cycle due to the predominance of turbulent transport over molecular transport the latter of which is the only mechanism accounted for in eq 7 5 application of models to field data field instruments have limitations in spatial and temporal sampling of bbls e g jabbari et al 2020 consequently models e g log law and stokes second problem have been applied to calculate indirectly the kinematics of bbls and interpolate observed results in space and time e g lorke et al 2002 mcginnis et al 2014 jabbari et al 2019 to test the applicability of models used in the literature to predict oscillatory bbl dynamics at field scale the simulation results from this work were compared to those from the models the goal was not to validate the model with published field data but rather to design an idealized companion dns les to determine model veracity this allowed for the generation of self consistent and geophysically relevant data to assist the development of algebraic models of bbl dynamics which are needed in field scale applications 5 1 lake currents lake alpnach is elliptical in shape and is a medium sized 4 76 km2 sub basin of lake lucerne located in central switzerland the les model used in this study has been shown to be successful in reproducing the oscillating flow in lake alpnach scalo et al 2013 accurately reproduced the observed current 10 cm above the bed in 2007 observations at r e δ s 2200 bryant et al 2010 here we compare to current velocities measured by lorke et al 2003 and lorke and wüest 2005 at a mid lake site with a local depth of 32 2 m for 25 h on 13 14 august 2002 using a four beam rdi workhorse adcp with a bin size of 0 1 m enabling a measurement range from 0 6 to 8 1 m above the bed and a three beam nortek ndp with a vertical bin size of 0 04 m resolving the range from 0 05 to 2 2 m above the sediment due to the surrounding mountainous topography there was a diurnal wind stress lake breeze along the main axis that causes strong seiching that generated an oscillatory bbl münnich et al 1992 gloor et al 2000 consequently lake alpnach has been an ideal site for research on internal waves bbl dynamics turbulence and mixing lorke et al 2002 2003 2005 lorke and wüest 2005 bryant et al 2010 becherer and umlauf 2011 the seiche driven horizontal currents exhibited a period of 18 h and the maximum measured velocity at 1 m above the bed was 27 mm s 1 this period is associated with the first horizontal second vertical mode internal seiche in the lake münnich et al 1992 from the period of the current and the velocity profiles figs 8a and 9 r e δ s 3880 which is close to the highest reynolds number computed in this study hence the field measurements were compared with the les results for r e δ s 3600 our simulations and those by scalo et al 2013 assumed a hydraulically smooth bed as is typical in the literature for geophysical les dns e g diamessis and redekopp 2006 aghsaee et al 2010 arthur and fringer 2014 lamb 2014 xu and stastna 2020 this computational simplification will introduce error considering that k s 0 014 m lorke et al 2002 and u τ m a x 1 3 10 3 ms 1 lorke et al 2003 giving a roughness reynolds number k s k s u τ m a x ν was 18 which is in the transitionally rough regime but not the fully rough regime i e k s 30 while it is beyond the scope of the present study to investigate the errors associated with using a smooth boundary for modeling a transitional regime future research should consider bottom roughness effects e g radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 the time series of observed mean current speeds 1 m above the bed were evaluated against the simulations fig 8a current measurements revealed higher levels of variance during periods of high velocity associated with enhanced turbulence this may be due to the differences between the simulations and the observed conditions i the forcing the current velocity fig 8a used in the simulations was only an approximate match of the observations ii the simulations were performed for a large number of cycles until periodic steady state whereas the field measurements represent a single cycle preceded by a different history and iii turbulence fig 8b and velocity fig 9 measurements have large uncertainties as will be discussed later fig 9 compares velocity profiles obtained from adcp measurements and les at two different times there are distinct current maxima typical of an oscillatory stokes velocity profile lorke et al 2003 the amplitude of these maxima decreases gradually with distance from the bed schlichting 1962 this feature is more obvious in the profile measured at 09 30 h fig 9b from the observations reproduced in fig 9b lorke et al 2002 estimated that the logarithmic boundary layer was restricted to the lowest 0 5 m above the sediment les velocity profiles were compared with log law extracted from the les fig 9 the logarithmic region was 1 m from the bed during strong turbulence ϕ 270 fig 9b whereas during weak turbulence ϕ 220 fig 9a the logarithmic region was 0 25 m from the bed during the earlier phases of oscillation the logarithmic layer does not exist since the boundary layer is not sufficiently thick to house the log layer jensen et al 1989 the log layer grows during the later phases when the flow reaches a fully turbulent state baroclinic and barotropic flows are believed to cause deviation from log law behavior outside the bbl lorke et al 2002 valipour et al 2015 consequently as initially reported in jensen et al 1989 application of the log law at greater heights is not valid the log law substantially over predicts the velocity profile obtained from the les away from the bed and predicts monotonic behavior that does not match the flow physics during the acceleration phase jensen et al 1989 jabbari et al 2020 5 2 rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy methods to compute energy dissipation from field data usually require assumptions that flow is steady homogeneous and isotropic doron et al 2001 lorke et al 2003 lorke 2007 jabbari et al 2015 2016 since these assumptions rarely apply in realistic cases the results may be inaccurate by applying several methods to compute dissipation from field data in the bottom boundary layer of lake erie jabbari et al 2020 showed that depending on the method used variations in the observed ε can be 1 or 2 orders of magnitude here we employ les fig 8c to assess error in computing ε using observational methods and compare these calculations to published dissipation observations from lake alpnach lorke and wüest 2005 the methods to compute ε from observations include fitting temperature microstructure profiles to the batchelor spectrum tmm or wavenumber time series to the kolmogorov spectrum in the inertial subrange idm density stratification may suppress turbulent overturns greater than the ozmidov scale becherer and umlauf 2011 umlauf et al 2015 however the field measurements from lake alpnach were during weak stratification n 2 10 5 s 2 average n 2 3 10 6 s 2 where n is the buoyancy frequency considering an average dissipation 10 9 w kg 1 fig 8c the ratio of the ozmidov length scale l 0 ε n 3 1 2 to kolmogorov length scale η ν 3 ε 1 4 i l 0 η ε ν n 2 3 4 was 80 which is much less than the 3000 required for stratification to impact turbulence bluteau et al 2011 fig 8b compares time series of ε 1 m above the sediment from i the three published experimental methods tmm and idm from 2 adcps lorke and wüest 2005 ii the log law based estimation eq 11 in which the dissipation was calculated using u τ from the les iii the dissipation was computed applying the idm method to the les time series eq 12 and iv the dissipation was calculated directly from the les eq 10 in all methods the turbulence followed the same periodic structure as the current velocity fig 8a and b there was a phase lag of 1 to 2 h between the seiche induced current and the turbulent energy dissipation in the les fig 8a and b which was also observed by lorke et al 2002 resulting from the seiche induced periodicity of the flow causing a local temporal imbalance between production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation from the field measurements and les calculations wascompared with those obtained from the log law computed from the les data figs 8b and 10 the tmm had very low dissipation 10 11 and 10 10 w kg 1 during the weak turbulence phases fig 10a and c these are at the noise floor for tmm measurements lorke et al 2003 and indicate nearly laminar flow lorke and wüest 2005 also give a noise floor detection limit of the automated estimation procedure for the rdi computed idm dissipation at 4 10 10 w kg 1 therefore the majority of the rdi dissipation estimates in fig 10c are noise with the exception of those near the bed the dissipation computed from log law was reasonable 47 error at 1 m fig 8b during the turbulent phases agreement was poorer in comparison to both observations and the direct les dissipation during the flow reversal and in the early phases of acceleration e g log law underestimates the dissipation by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude between 06 00 and 08 30 at 1 m above the bed fig 8b this was because the flow condition did not satisfy the idealized assumptions of stationary and fully developed turbulence these results were similar to observations from lakes with similar boundary layer dynamics for example in lake michigan near bed turbulence agreed with log law on average but individual estimates deviated substantially cannon and troy 2018 in lake erie dissipation from log law typically exceeded that from other methods particularly near the bed and during peak current velocities jabbari et al 2020 and in lake alpnach log law and tmm dissipation estimates both showed the same temporal pattern but that from log law was 2 orders of magnitude greater and 1 5 h ahead in phase relative to tmm lorke et al 2002 to assess the accuracy of the idm the dissipation was also calculated by applying the idm to wavenumber spectra of the streamwise velocity component from the les figs 8b and 10 the idm is ideally applied to homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows with high reynolds number bluteau et al 2011 jabbari et al 2020 these conditions were not fulfilled during all phases of the oscillatory cycle resulting considerable error in prediction of dissipation e g over 0 ϕ 20 fig 10c the idm dissipation at 1 m above the bed is 2 times less than the les there was a better agreement between les and idm when the oscillation was in the turbulent phases e g at ϕ 270 in fig 10b in general the idm was more accurate than log law in computing ε even through the strong turbulence phases e g at 09 30 h fig 10b this error indicates that despite the high reynolds number and the long forcing period 18 h the assumption of local equilibrium between production and dissipation does not hold by assuming a quasi steady state significant error results the idm also assumes that the flow is homogeneous and isotropic therefore one would expect similar errors to occur however when using the les data the idm is more accurate than the log law estimate this may be due to the log law being based on an equilibrium between dissipation and production which occurs in larger eddies near the boundary large eddies are more anisotropic and so equilibrium is rare the idm on the other hand is based on the spectrum in the inertial subrange which considers eddies much smaller than the integral scale whose timescales are shorter making them more likely to be homogeneous and isotropic than the larger energy containing eddies responsible for production by applying different methods to compute dissipation we may evaluate methodological and measurements error as well as uncertainties in the idealized simulations figs 8b and 10 in general the errors between les vs idm dissipation and even les vs log law i e methodological errors were significantly smaller than the scatter of the field data using the same method i e measurement errors e g 1 to 2 order of magnitude difference between idm applied to rdi and nortek measurements fig 8b specifically the uncertainty between field observations measurement errors methodological errors was 2 order of magnitude during the early phases of acceleration before the turbulent phase e g 3 order of magnitude difference between tmm and idm applied to rdi and nortek at 07 30 fig 8b this was noticeably greater than the difference between the direct les dissipation and the average field measurements generally 1 order of magnitude fig 8b that can be attributed to the differences between the idealized numerical setup and the observational conditions i e currents in fig 8a the periodic steady state nature of les and or measurement error in the field 6 conclusions idealized dns and les of oscillating bbl flows that occur in lakes and coastal oceans were performed to test the applicability of bbls models log law and stokes second problem to reproduce the associated flow kinematics for laminar oscillating flows r e δ s 550 the applicability of the log law in reproducing velocity profiles was limited to the early turbulent phases whereas for fully turbulent flows r e δ s 3000 the log law was reasonably accurate in most phases with 2 error the laminar solution of stokes second problem was only applicable in reproducing velocity profiles in the laminar regimes and gave errors 40 for r e δ s 1000 application of different models to lake currents shows that the dissipation obtained from the log law was similar to the les data at 1 m above the bed during turbulent phases but the errors were large 1 order of magnitude when the flow reverses the idm applied to the les data showed better accuracy than the log law especially during the weak turbulence of the acceleration phase in an oscillatory bbl cycle when homogeneous and isotropic conditions are less likely to occur the error associated with applying the equilibrium assumption to an oscillatory flow is therefore more significant than those resulting from anisotropy the error in computing dissipation when applying log law and idm to les data methodological error significantly less than the large scatter in dissipation from different observational methods and instruments suggesting that measurement error as opposed to methodological error predominates when computing observed dissipation in oscillatory bbl flows thus more research is required to assess the accuracy of acoustic
