7950,study region santa river basin peru study focus in the andes of peru climate change and socio economic development are expected to jeopardize future water availability however little is known about the interplay of multiple climatic and non climatic stressors and related processes driving water resource changes we developed an integrated model that analyzes different trajectories of water availability including hydro climatic water supply and socio economic water demand variables with consistent multi descriptor future scenarios until 2050 new hydrological insights for the region at the lower basin outflow of condorcerro mean annual water availability is projected to increase by 10 12 by 2050 this gain is mainly driven by an increase in annual precipitation amounts of about 14 rcp2 6 and 18 rcp8 5 respectively which was computed using a global climate multi model ensemble in contrast mean dry season water availability is projected to substantially decrease by 33 and 36 24 by 2050 for rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 respectively this decline is driven by a combination of diminishing glacier discharge and increasing water demand both of which adopt a major role in the absence of considerable precipitation inputs these seasonal differences highlight the need to adequately consider spatiotemporal scales within multi scenario water balance models to support local decision making our results elucidate the need for improvements in water management and infrastructure to counteract diminishing dry season water availability and to reduce future risks of water scarcity graphical abstract ga1 keywords water supply water demand socio hydrology socio economic scenarios santa river peru 1 introduction in the tropical andes water resources play a fundamental role for societies and ecosystems where the mountain cryosphere is an important source of freshwater in the mountains themselves and in downstream regions buytaert et al 2017 mark and seltzer 2003 vuille et al 2018 climate change impacts on glacier fed river basins have altered annual and seasonal river runoff in some catchments the point of peak water has already passed baraer et al 2012 huss and hock 2018 and water runoff is since decreasing and posing considerable risks of water scarcity for households agriculture and hydropower drenkhan et al 2015 hagen et al 2022 hock et al 2019 vuille et al 2018 recent studies such as immerzeel et al 2020 and viviroli et al 2020 recognize that impacts on the world s water towers are driven by both socio economic factors and climate change which are expected to exacerbate water scarcity conditions in the future veldkamp et al 2016 future water availability and scarcity are not only driven by population growth but also by other drivers such as coping capacity infrastructure financial resources capability of governmental structures portfolio of economic activities dependent on water resources which can increase the vulnerability to water scarcity veldkamp et al 2016 there is growing understanding that human catchment interventions and increasing water demand considerably shape current and particularly future water availability worldwide immerzeel et al 2020 veldkamp et al 2016 including the tropical andes buytaert et al 2017 carey et al 2017 drenkhan et al 2019 vuille et al 2018 as water demand is driven by more than population growth and water use per capita future water demand models are challenged to go beyond these estimates more socio hydrological approaches are needed that integrate actions of societies governments and politics including how they manage available water as societies and how politics influence the hydrological cycle linton and budds 2014 paerregaard 2018 pande et al 2022 as water is regulated through local institutions the modeling of future water systems is more complex due to the current structures with multiple competing water uses multiple actors formal and informal rules both temporally and spatially that might outweigh local climate change impacts this challenge needs to be addressed by more interdisciplinary and holistic approaches reynard et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 zimmer et al 2021 the cordillera blanca in peru is recognized as a global hotspot in terms of impacts from glacier melt on water resources huss and hock 2018 local studies have addressed the potential outcomes of multi variable climate change on water resources van soesbergen and mulligan 2018 and human vulnerabilities buytaert and bievre 2012 lynch 2012 the santa river catchment draining the cordillera blanca to the pacific is also a site where socio hydrological studies have started to emerge underyling the importance of the social realm for water resources in the region carey et al 2014 however quantitative studies integrating both water supply and demand based on rigorous climatic and socio economic scenarios are rare in the andes region only a few studies have investigated current and future water supply at monthly scale in the santa river catchment ana 2015 condom et al 2012 vergara et al 2011 but further insights particularly on patterns of current and future water demand remain both temporally and spatially not sufficiently quantified and understood comprehensive quantitative analyses of water resources including supply and demand in climate sensitive mountain regions are often limited by data scarcity and the complexity of climate change drivers rasul and molden 2019 global and regional studies are not detailed enough to show the causes and impacts of water deficit at the local level nevertheless there is a strong demand from policy makers for projections about the potential impacts of climate change on water resources within integrated environmental models combining climatic and hydrologic models buytaert et al 2009 despite considerable uncertainties related to future development and data scarcity current and future water management and robust adaptation planning require future water modeling outputs by developing meaningful scenarios for the mid next decades and long term beyond 2050 recognizing the importance of the santa river catchment in a regional andes context this study aims at developing an interdisciplinary model framework for assessing future water supply and demand until 2050 by combining hydro climatic modelling and socio economic scenarios for the santa river catchment in the andes of peru our model framework is intended to represent a useful tool for the analysis of the different components determining current and future water availability and thus supporting local decision making of mid term future water management under limited data availability and associated uncertainties in the following we use the term water supply and water demand to refer to the hydro climatic and socio economic components respectively and water availability to point to the integrated function of combined water supply and demand 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the santa river catchment in central peru which drains parts of the glaciated cordillera blanca in the western andes more specifically we divide the santa river catchment into two sub catchments down to the gauge stations la balsa 1880 m asl 4800 km² and condorcerro 477 m asl which together cover about 90 of the entire santa river catchment 10 400 km² following strong precipitation seasonality the santa river shows high discharge variability with up to 300 m³ s in the wet season november april and down to 25 m³ s during the dry season june september at condorcerro with a total glacier area of about 280 km² the upper sub catchment la balsa covers a major part of the cordillera blanca glaciers which have lost about 38 of their area from 726 km² in 1962 449 km² in 2016 inaigem 2018 particularly in headwaters and during the dry season glacial meltwater has an important role with a relative contribution to river discharge of up to 67 at la balsa condom et al 2012 peak water i e the point at which long term river runoff is decreasing and streamflow variability is increasing due to subsequently vanishing glaciers has likely been passed in several sub catchments of la balsa baraer et al 2012 the decline in meltwater contribution and acid rock drainage from recently exposed glacial sediments have triggered deterioration of water quality in some sub catchments of the santa river santofimia et al 2017 zimmer et al 2021 and might thus exacerbate water scarcity and pressure over water resource use in the catchment carey et al 2014 drenkhan et al 2015 the upper santa river catchment is home to about 650 000 people with huaraz 119 000 inhabitants being by far the largest city and most important center for local markets and mountain tourism inei 2017 furthermore about half 49 of all inhabitants in the region do not have access to secure drinking water via the public network which considerably exceeds the national average of 34 inei 2018 low socioeconomic development and water insecurity in the santa river catchment can be translated into high vulnerabilities and exposure of people and assets particularly in remote regions with weak infrastructure and governmental incidence drenkhan et al 2015 condorcerro represents the control gauge station for the large scale agricultural export industry at the dry pacific coast chinecas áncash region and chavimochic la libertad region which are mostly supplied by santa water via huge interbasin transfers in the order of 35 45 m³ s both projects compete over limited water allocation from the santa river and represent an important regional employer for instance chavimochic hosts 46 9 km² of high value export crops and offers 66 000 jobs in the region drenkhan et al 2015 its current production scheme requires around 597 million m3 of annual water resources from which 87 is covered by the santa river via a single intake canal at 412 m asl below condorcerro future projections of water demand considering crop area extension of 66 km² towards 2050 suggest potentially severe water deficit aste cannock 2018 related to economic growth the total installed energy capacity in peru has nearly doubled from 8 0 gw in 2009 to 15 2 gw in 2019 and is to a large extent sustained by hydropower which has grown from 3 3 gw to 5 4 gw in the same period minem 2020 the total installed hydropower capacity in the santa river catchment includes around 401 mw which is mainly backed by cañon del pato 263 mw and quitaracsa plants 118 mw in peru several hydropower plant extensions are underway but their planning and construction is highly contentious and might be unfeasible in several cases for instance lake parón situated in the la balsa catchment has been subject to an emblematic social conflict where multiple water users e g the community cruz de mayo and the cañon del pato operator duke energy compete over water control due to a lack of governmental water governance and exclusion from decision making carey et al 2012 peru s water governance framework is in a transition with the implementation of the new water resources law in 2009 which aims at integrated water resources management iwrm on the long term drenkhan et al 2015 this fundamental paradigm change consists of a stepwise decentralization of water management functions and an integration of multiple stakeholders by means of regional water resources basin councils nonetheless institutional fragilities exclusion of water users from decision making and ongoing water conflicts hamper these efforts carey et al 2012 drenkhan et al 2015 lynch 2012 this is also true for the santa river catchment where until date no water resources basin council has been implemented owed to the complex situation of weak water governance and ongoing social conflicts despite of considerable financial and institutional efforts drenkhan et al 2015 mark et al 2017 data scarcity and inconsistencies coupled with complex process interactions and thus limited knowledge and process understanding are challenging climate change and water related studies in the andes condom et al 2020 huggel et al 2015 the above outlined complex interplay of highly seasonal water availability data limitations and cascading effects from climate change impacts and socioeconomic development confers to the santa river catchment a crucial role to explore future water availability for coupled social environmental systems under consideration of high uncertainties and the need for climate change adaptation 2 2 hydro climatic data and climate scenarios the study is based on an interdisciplinary approach combining the key variables of water supply hydro climatic data and demand socio economic data in order to assess the future development of water availability of the santa river due to the data scarcity in the study area we had to make a number of assumptions and simplifications for the input data and the development of the integrated water balance model for example data for irrigation water demand was only available on administrative units for individual years with no further information on specific abstraction points this also applies to the modelling of hydrological processes as reliable discharge time series are only available for the two gauges in the study area preventing a more detailed analysis in smaller sub catchments for this reason the socio economic water demand scenarios and corresponding quantifications are developed for la balsa and condorcerro catchments the hydrological modelling is carried out using a lumped conceptual model the data basis for the socio economic and hydro climatic scenarios and the implementation of these data in the model are described in the following sections 2 2 1 historical observations 1981 2015 for the model calibration for the period from 1981 to 2015 gridded historical data for temperature and precipitation of the peruvian interpolated data of the senamhi s climatological and hydrological observations pisco was used the data is available on a 0 1 10 km resolution on a daily and monthly time scale the gridded dataset represents the only spatially and temporally continuous climatic database at this scale available in peru it is based on three different data sources which all exhibit certain weaknesses aybar et al 2020 the in situ gauges have large data gaps and inconsistencies and the remote sensing precipitation estimates from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps show biases especially on shorter time scales aybar et al 2020 mantas et al 2015 rivera et al 2018 scheel et al 2011 furthermore only seven rain gauges used for the pisco dataset are situated within the santa catchment which is insufficient for capturing the full detail of spatio temporal precipitation variability on a daily basis because of these shortages there are concerns about pisco precipitation data being used for precipitation trends extreme events or other applications related to e g climate change aybar et al 2020 nevertheless this data set has been successfully used in other studies in peru e g imfeld et al 2020 laudien et al 2020 in our study we are interested in the monthly water balance rather than short term extremes aybar et al 2020 asseses the dataset as suitable for water balance evaluations in this area the mean monthly temperature was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration etp using the method from oudin et al 2005 for each pisco grid cell within the catchment in situ discharge measurements provided by local hydropower agencies are available for the gauges la balsa and condorcerro the time series cover the years 1981 2015 however the data is incomplete for some years especially for the gauge la balsa therefore missing data was infilled using a copula based approach which was presented by bárdossy and pegram 2014 this approach depends on correlation between neighboring observations and uses copulas to infill missing hydro meteorological data based on a conditional distribution that gives the interval in which the missing value is expected to lay the infilling method showed reliable results for monthly discharges with a nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 86 and 0 89 for la balsa and condorcerro respectively table 1 gives an overview of the data used for historical and future time periods 2 2 2 future climate scenarios downscaling and disaggregation for simulating future discharge fig 4 we used precipitation and temperature data from the cordex simulations for south america cordex org with an ensemble of five driving general circulation models gcms ichec ec earth miroc miroc5 mpi m mpi esm lr ncc noresm1 m mohc hadgem2 es that were used by the regional climate model rca4 at 0 5 spatial resolution future projections were modelled for the representative concentration pathways rcps rcp2 6 and 8 5 as these indicate the low and high end of global temperature increase cordex data is available on daily and monthly time scale daily historic climate scenarios for the catchment area are not capable of adequately reproducing the quantity and temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation whereas the monthly data were found more reliable however the monthly data also showed bias and needed to be bias corrected before further use we bias corrected and downscaled future monthly precipitation and temperature data to the pisco grid cells 0 1 using a quantile quantile transformation qq transformation piani et al 2010 for this method the quantiles are formed from both the observed and the simulated data and plotted against each other this allows to derive a transfer function which can be used to correct the modeled data since our integrated water balance model runs on a daily resolution to account for the hydrological processes the monthly precipitation and temperature cordex data was disaggregated to daily data to account for the high temporal and spatial precipitation variability in the study region mourre et al 2015 seidel et al 2019 a stochastic approach for disaggregation of the monthly precipitation data using a first order markov chain model was applied for each pisco grid cell a day with precipitation 1 mm is considered wet otherwise it is defined as dry the transition probabilities for wet and dry days were calculated based on the daily pisco precipitation dataset to account for the distinct annual cycle in precipitation the transition probabilities for each grid cell were calculated for each day using a linear weighted 31 day moving window based on these transition probabilities the markov model was used to generate sequences of wet and dry days for each pisco grid cell in order to preserve a certain spatial correlation a cholesky decomposition was applied to create spatially correlated random numbers for the markov model for disaggregating the cordex precipitation data we assume that these transitions probabilities will remain constant for the time period 2021 2050 the disaggregation of the monthly cordex precipitation is based on the number of wet days generated from the markov model precipitation values for these wet days drawn from the distribution function based on daily pisco data for each month and a scaling factor k with which the precipitation values are adjusted to the monthly sum the scaling factor k is calculated as follows k i j 0 n f i x j m i where f i x is the distribution function of precipitation values for the month i based on the pisco data from 1981 2015 n i are number of wet days simulated from the markov model for the month i and m i is the monthly precipitation from cordex for 2021 2050 the daily precipitation values for each month are then adjusted with the scaling ki factor such that pcp i j f i x j k i for j 1 n where pcp i j is the adjusted value for day j since temperatures and potential evapotranspiration have much less spatio temporal variability than precipitation the disaggregation was performed by distributing the monthly values equally over all days fig 2 shows the projected temperature and precipitation based on the above described process on average the gcms used for the cordex runs indicate a mean annual temperature increase by 2 c over pre industrial levels rcp2 6 and by 3 c rcp8 5 and an increase of annual precipitation sum by 14 rcp2 6 and by 18 rcp8 5 by 2040 2050 as compared to 2005 2015 the historic and future glacier runoff was simulated using the gsm model from rs minerve garcía hernández et al 2016 gsm is a temperature index glacier melt model that uses precipitation temperature and glacier surface to simulate glacier runoff the model uses different temperature thresholds to separate solid and liquid precipitation and snow and ice melting in addition a sinusoidal function allows to simulate the snow and ice melt seasonality which is highly important in the tropical andes the model results were assessed by looking at both the seasonal melting maximum glacier runoff around december and minimum values around august and mass balance which was compared with estimations from dussaillant et al 2019 for the historic period we used the pisco data and historic glacier outlines see table 1 while for the future period we used the biased corrected cordex data and the glacier outlines based on the method proposed by schauwecker et al 2017 gcms are apt to provide a broad perspective vuille et al 2008 but some important aspects need to be considered although the simulation of large scale patterns of precipitation has improved since the ipcc 4th assessment report in 2007 gcms continue to perform less well for precipitation than for surface temperature at regional scales assessment of precipitation simulations often remains difficult due to observational uncertainties flato et al 2013 further gcms show inconsistencies in the sign and magnitude of precipitation change including for many parts of the tropical andes where they widely disagree on the direction and magnitude of the change in precipitation buytaert et al 2010 2009 wijngaard et al 2018 in order to eliminate the variability of the precipitation signals from the gcms we added an additional scenario with the same future precipitation patterns and totals as the current precipitation for this individual years from the pisco daily precipitation data were randomly assigned to a year in the future simulation period 2021 2050 and only the temperature was taken from the cordex data 2 3 socio economic data and methodology domestic water use small and large scale agriculture hydropower and mining are the main drivers of water demand in the santa valley drenkhan et al 2015 in this study we particularly focus on the future development of domestic and agricultural demand which are the largest and most important drivers of human water demand in the basin and the related impact on water availability we started by using basic parameters that describe the water demand for domestic and agricultural purposes therefore we used data of population domestic water consumption and agricultural area as well as agricultural water demand population data was derived from the census data of the peruvian statistics institute inei for the years 1993 2007 and 2017 inei 2017 2007 1993 which provides the number of inhabitants for the districts as well as population projections until 2025 for the ancash region the average current water consumption of the population of huaraz and caraz is around 180 l capita day this number of domestic water demand is derived from the local water provider eps chavin for the year 2016 and also based on data of drenkhan et al 2019 agricultural area was taken from the inei census at district level for 1994 and 2012 inei 2012 1994 noting that for some districts the spatial delimitations of administrative districts does not match with the catchment area agricultural demand is based on ana 2012 which estimates the demand for the santa river catchment in the order of 526 million m3 of water for the year 2012 this data was used to estimate the historical water demand from 1981 to 2015 at a monthly time step then the historical water demand simulation was included in the hydrological model to simulate the total runoff 2 3 1 socio economic scenarios the future water demand is based on socio economic scenarios in order to evaluate the possible future tendencies of water demand we developed scenarios of societal and technological change to understand the complex interplay between these fields and to describe possible future developments of society political factors infrastructure and the environment for the future water situation in the santa river basin in 2050 these scenarios are developed using cross impact balance analysis cib www cross impact org offering a basis to discuss the robustness of concepts transformation pathways interventions and technology assessments as well as risks and uncertainties weimer jehle 2006 cib is a qualitative method of system analysis a system is qualitatively described and evaluated by key drivers and their interdependencies among themselves using cross impact judgments cib ensures internal consistency of the results and therefore the analysis provides consistent scenarios this method has been used successfully within various sectors including climate change e g schweizer and lazurko 2020 energy e g pregger et al 2020 water e g sharma et al 2020 waste e g saner et al 2011 and others in the water sector in lima peru kosow and león 2015 miranda sara and baud 2014 cib scenarios were used as a basis to formulate an action plan for sustainable urban water management schütze et al 2019 the cib method consists of the following process steps 1 definition of key drivers descriptors 2 description of driver states sub scenarios 3 assessments of interrelations between each driver state cib matrix 4 identification of internally consistent scenarios following this process the first step was to define the socio economic key drivers for the water management of the santa river watershed these key drivers describe the main influencing factors for future water demand in the santa river watershed we refer to them as descriptors these descriptors were identified by consulting relevant documents and by interviewing 15 local experts and stakeholders from different agencies connected to local and regional water management academia public administration from water agriculture business sectors and ngos 1 1 local agencies involved are the peruvian national water authority autoridad nacional del agua ana local water administration administración local del agua ala glaciers and ecosystems research national institute instituto nacional de investigación en glaciares y ecosistemas de montaña inagem ancash chamber of commerce industry and tourism cámara de comercio industria y turismo de ancash water users association of the callejón de huaylas junta de usuarios del callejón de huaylas independencia

provider of sanitation services for drinking water and sewerage chavín prestadora de servicios de saneamiento de agua potable y alcantarillado chavín eps chavin care peru huascarán national park parque nacional huascarán ombudsman office defensoría del pueblo the stakeholder interviews were conducted in january february and august 2017 in huaraz the second step was to describe possible future developments of each of the descriptors sub scenarios in total 15 descriptors linked to different sub scenarios between 2 and 3 for each descriptor were identified as shown in table 2 their detailed description can be found in table 1 in the supplement in order to systematically analyze the interdependencies between each of the sub scenarios an evaluation was performed using a qualitative concept of cross impact judgments weimer jehle 2006 this method utilizes expert knowledge to assess interrelations between sub scenarios this evaluation took place by conducting interviews with local stakeholders from the study area as described above the interviewees were asked how a certain sub scenario of one descriptor would promote or inhibit the sub scenario of another descriptor this was done for all descriptor sub scenarios and later transformed quantitatively using an impact scale from 3 strongly inhibiting to 3 strongly promoting as a result a cross impact matrix was built see supplement table 3 the water demand descriptors descriptors k l m n were defined as passive descriptors as they receive but do not exert impact onto other descriptor sub scenarios finally to identify internally consistent future scenarios based on the cib algorithm weimer jehle 2006 the free cib software scenariowizard www cross impact org english cib e scw htm was used the software examines all possible combinations of sub scenarios 6 4 million combinations in this case and balances the supports and hindrances indicated by the cross impact matrix that the sub scenarios generate among themselves for each combination the software selects the nash optimal combinations as scenarios nash 1951 i e those combinations in which no descriptor can further improve its net support from the other descriptors by switching to another sub scenario thus each of these scenarios describes a network of self reinforcing developments weimer jehle et al 2020 suppl mat the results of the performed cib analysis are described in chapter 3 2 to validate the scenario analysis results a stakeholder workshop socio economic scenarios for the adaptation and sustainable management of water resources in the santa river basin was organized in august 2018 in huaraz and involved 30 experts and stakeholders from different agencies 2 2 participants ala huaraz ana ugrh eps chavin ancash regional government inaigem indeci mountain institute three basins commonwealth waraq commonwealth huaraz municipality sernanp sunass unasam wayintsik the objectives of the workshop were to i inform about possible future scenarios in the santa river basin by 2050 ii evaluate and discuss the configuration of the scenarios and iii to propose robust adaptation and management initiatives for the scenarios 2 3 2 integration of socio economic and hydro climatic scenarios to combine the socio economic and hydro climatic data we had to convert qualitative socio economic scenarios into time series of water use as the socio economic descriptors are interdependent we quantified and translated them into the hydrological model by using the parameters that define water demand i e population domestic demand agriculture and water infrastructure which are further explained below the interdependencies and likelihood of the socio economic scenarios are expressed by the cib values the likelihood of each development assumed in a socio economic scenario is measured in a semi qualitative way by the impact sum of the respective development while these values will be explained in detail in the result section they allow us to translate the socio economic descriptors into integrated scenarios by using the following parameters population the population change 2021 2050 is based on the population growth for the ancash region provided by inei 2017 which is only provided until 2025 whereas the population change estimation until 2050 is needed in order to fit the data and model we assume that the growth rate after 2025 decreases by 0 01 point corresponding to the rate of increase between 2020 and 2025 after all the population increases for all socio economic scenarios in the model domestic water demand the domestic demand was calculated based on the population we assumed a current state of 180 l capita day and a future state for 2050 of 250 l capita day 20 l for increasing and 120 l capita day 20 l decreasing water corresponding to data from the local water provider for the upper santa eps chavin and drenkhan et al 2019 the cib values are transferred into probabilities for the occurrence of that future development and distribution values were generated into time series until 2050 agriculture depending on the socio economic scenario the agricultural area could increase decrease or stay constant constant refers to the state in the year 2015 for increasing and decreasing development the agriculture areas were changed increased decreased in 5 year steps 2020 2045 the areas are based on the irrigated area provided by inei 1994 and 2012 the growth rate between those years was used to calculate the historical extent of 1980 as well as future extent until 2050 although the growth rate then is projected to be much less than observed for the past years and decades we also distinguished the growth of irrigated area in the glaciated main santa valley down to la balsa which is between 5 and 1 assuming growth rate will decrease for the 5 year steps and in the non glaciated northern part north of la balsa which is between 1 and 2 assuming growth rate will increase as this area is less accessible and populated this results in a different distribution of irrigated agricultural area between the north and the south of the catchment the resulting irrigated area was then multiplied by an irrigation amount of 1 34 mm day which corresponds to 4900 m3 ha year as provided for the santa catchment by ana 2012 consistent with the gridded resolution of temperature and precipitation the spatial irrigation data were used to get a lumped time series note we added a simulation with agricultural water demand of 3 mm day in order to account for increase in agricultural demand or unaccounted non measured water usage results can be found in the supplement water infrastructure water infrastructure such as water channels pipes and water treatment plants is critical for the amount of water that reaches the end user domestic or agricultural consumer however infrastructure in the study region is rather poor we consider water leakages in the order of 45 for the current situation drenkhan et al 2019 kosow et al 2013 liemberger and wyatt 2019 for the future we assume an improvement of infrastructure with reduced leakages at 35 or a deteriorated infrastructure with increased leakages at 55 additionally we assume an uncertainty range of 5 these percentages apply both for domestic and agricultural use for all parameters a time series has been calculated according to possible changes over time the interpolation methods and time steps for interpolation are shown in table 3 depending on the tendencies given in the cib scenarios the model chooses which future development decrease constant increase will be generated in the time series this means the higher the impact sum the higher the probability for the associated future development to occur if constant and increasing have both the same positive impact sum and decreasing has a negative impact sum constant and increasing both have the same probability to occur while decreasing will not occur after the model defined the future development it randomly draws a number for the end point of future development from the given range e g 250 20 l capita the start and end value of the time series is known and with a given function e g linear or a step function the time series are interpolated between start and end value next to the scenarios generated by the cib we added a business as usual scenario bau as baseline in this scenario the demand parameters for the descriptors stay the same for the future as for current i e domestic demand is kept at 180 l capita person population remains constant and agricultural area for the catchment is around 123 000 ha and water demand equivalent to 1 34 mm day we use this scenario to first show the effects of changes of the hydro climatic parameters as related to the gcms and underlying emission scenarios rcps later on we compare it to the socio economic scenarios of the cibs except for the bau scenario all scenario model runs were repeated 50 times for each model run a new possible time series for domestic demand and water infrastructure was generated as described above this allows us to address the uncertainty of the future water demand 2 4 integrated water balance model for the integration of the hydro climatic and socio economic data and scenarios we build an integrated water balance model to simulate water discharge as an integrated function of both water supply and demand the model is based on a variation of the conceptual daily rainfall runoff model hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning bergström 1992 1976 which models the discharge of a catchment using precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration since the hbv model does not simulate runoff from glacier areas the runoff from these areas was simulated separately using the gsm model from rs minerve modelling framework as described above garcía hernández et al 2016 and added as input to the hbv model additionally routines to simulate water demand based on agricultural and domestic water consumption data were included the hbv model is set up with two separate hydrological response units hrus fig 2 in each sub catchment to account for irrigated agricultural areas on the one hand and rain fed agricultural and non agricultural areas on the other the total daily water demand is subtracted from the runoff and fed back into the model by means of two feedback loops one feedback loop simulates the agricultural demand for irrigation and is included in hru 2 the irrigation water is added as additional soil moisture with time lapse of one day from here it is either entering the reservoirs of the model or leaving the system over evapotranspiration the second feedback loop for domestic demand is included in hru 1 since waste water is usually drained into the river most of the demand water in the model is flowing back to the discharge with a modeled time lapse of one day for both agriculture and domestic demand a portion of the water is lost through the infrastructure with a time lapse of one day due to leakage or inefficiency into the upper reservoir two time periods were simulated a historical period from 1981 to 2015 and a future period from 2021 to 2050 using the climate rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 and socio economic scenarios the model is running on daily time step but the final results were assessed on a monthly basis the model was cross validated for the two periods 1981 1995 and 2000 2014 the calibration was done simultaneously for both sub catchments for the period 1981 1995 and validated with the period 2000 2014 and vice versa for calibration the differential evolution de optimization method was used storn and price 1997 the results of the calibration were assessed for monthly discharge time series using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and the log nash sutcliffe model efficiency lognse coefficient the model performance results and calibration parameters are shown in table 4 as well as in the supplement table 2 and supplement figs 1 and 2 respectively the calibrated parameters are listed in supplement table 2 3 results 3 1 climate change scenarios historic and future water supply first we report on the hydro climatic part and related water supply without considering the socio economic water demand part fig 4 shows the mean annual discharge for the historic 1981 2015 and future 2021 2050 time periods for annual dry season and wet season for rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 based on the bau socio economic scenario we noticed a lag of response of one month in the discharge values as compared to the wet and dry seasons of precipitation therefore we used the months july august and september jas representative for the dry season discharge and january february and march jfm for the wet season discharge our results show important differences between the middle and lower catchment parts la balsa and condorcerro respectively in terms of changes in water availability for the entire catchments represented by the condorcerro gauge mean annual discharge is projected to increase until 2050 as compared to the historic baseline which is mainly driven by increasing precipitation fig 2 and an increase in runoff in the wet season jfm figs 4 and 5 in contrast model results indicate a strong decrease of discharge for the dry season in condorcerro the variability among the different gcm s is considerable for annual wet and dry season discharge for the upper santa catchment la balsa the picture is different annual discharge is projected to decrease over the next decades while the wet season shows a tendency towards discharge decrease but with a pronounced variability among climate models the dry season however shows a very strong decrease in discharge which is consistent across climate models fig 6 for la balsa we also analyzed glacial meltwater changes in absolute terms and relative to total discharge supplement table 4 at annual scale glacial meltwater decreases both in absolute and relative terms as compared to current 4 and historic 8 conditions the same is true for the wet season and in both cases for rcp8 5 meltwater decrease is slightly stronger compared to current 5 and historic 10 conditions than for rcp2 6 4 and 9 respectively for the dry season glacial meltwater decreases in absolute terms however due to projected decreasing precipitation inputs relative contribution of glacial meltwater would increase by 29 rcp2 6 to 35 rcp8 5 compared to current conditions hence the reliance on glacier meltwater during the dry season becomes even more important in the next decades 3 2 socio economic scenarios the cib analysis generated 29 consistent scenarios s1 to s29 that represent the possible alternative pathways of future socio economic development as a function of water governance regime and temperature and precipitation change see supplement table 5 in the condorcerro catchment from a total of 29 scenarios five were selected for the subsequent modelling because these are the most diverging scenarios that differ within the relevant descriptors see table 3 finally only four scenarios were chosen for the integrated modelling as s8 has overlapping input parameters with s12 see table 3 nevertheless we wanted to highlight the scenario as it has a difference to s12 regarding socio political factors s8 s12 s23 and s28 were discussed in detail in the stakeholder workshop in 2018 in huaraz while s22 was added due to its different sub scenario where the agricultural demand is decreasing the different combinations of descriptor sub scenarios for each of the selected five scenarios can be seen in table 5 as mentioned previously the descriptors may influence each other and some are interdependent this means that they can have either a promoting positive or an inhibiting negative effect for example whether domestic water demand descriptor k is decreasing constant or increasing depends on population welfare and inequality water policies water pricing and cultural awareness furthermore these different socio economic descriptor developments all together can either foster or hinder the tendency of how future demand would develop assuming for example that as shown in scenario s28 domestic water demand would increase k1 emigration b3 could potentially offset that increase as could a decline in gdp and increasing inequality c3 weak sectorial water policies f2 a water pricing scheme that doesn t include investment and operational costs g3 and low cultural awareness within the population for saving water h3 on the other hand would increase water demand however as there are fostering and hindering impacts towards domestic water demand development this does not only depend on one descriptor impact but on the sum of positive and negative impacts these tendencies are described in the cib algorithm by impact sums since the individual descriptors in the socio economic scenarios influence each other it allows to focus on certain descriptors k l the impact sum provides an indicator whether a sub scenario is likely or not it further allows to quantify the socio economic scenarios therefore we use the descriptors that can be quantified such as domestic and agricultural demand population and water infrastructure where we can find quantitative data table 5 chapter 3 2 a closer look at the scenarios s8 and s12 indicates that some descriptors have the same tendency this certainly leads to similar results for the discharge generated by the integrated water balance model however the underlying descriptors are different even though the descriptor sub scenarios of welfare government agriculture and cultural awareness differ it leads to the same discharge results due to the domestic and agricultural demand input and therefore the future water availability this just leads to a difference in likelihood of the sub scenario but does not change that the demand of agriculture tends to remain constant that is why s8 is not included in the integrated balance model but shows that future water availability is dependent on different socio economic descriptors 3 3 integrated water balance model in the following we focus on current discharge 2005 2015 and future discharge 2040 2050 changes for the entire catchment condorcerro in the integrated water balance model in contrast to the results in section 3 1 discharge is a function of water supply and demand and hence represents water availability in the catchment from the comparison of the bau scenario in fig 4 we can see that the used gcms show a rather broad range of future changes for both rcp scenarios fig 5 shows the mean annual discharge for the different socio economic and climate scenarios separated by the five gcms on the one hand we compare the mean monthly discharge in m3 s and on the other hand the cumulative monthly discharge volume in km3 there is no common trend among the gcms based cordex model runs some of the underlying gcms show a large range of values others do not except for one model scenario ichec ec earth the cumulative volume of the gcms and scenarios for one year is above the current time and in the order of 4 6 km3 fig 5 the differences of the mean annual discharge between the gcms are rather large and in the order of around 50 m3 s difference the mean annual discharge of the gcms shows a general increase in discharge at condorcerro for the future scenarios ichec ec earth and miroc miroc5 indicate lower values for the rcp8 5 compared to the current discharge and rcp2 6 mpi m mpi esm lr ncc noresm1 m and mohc hadgem2 es on the other hand show an increase from the current levels while ncc noresm1 m and mohc hadgem2 es also show an increase from rcp2 6 to rcp8 5 whereas the other three scenarios show a decrease from rcp2 6 to rcp8 5 table 6 presents the results of the multi year mean of annual and seasonal discharge at condorcerro based on the 5 gcms and 5 socio economic scenarios for the period 2040 2050 including their change to the current discharge minimum and maximum values are shown for the multi year mean and for single years and seasons for the two rcps on average the gcms indicate increased annual discharge by 15 m3 s 11 in rcp2 6 and by 13 m3 s 9 in rcp8 5 compared to the current baseline 2005 2015 whereas mean dry season discharge decreases by 14 m3 s 33 rcp2 6 and by 15 m3 s 36 rcp8 5 respectively mean wet season discharge increases by 43 m3 s 18 and by 39 m3 s 17 respectively another space of possible future development is sketched by socio economic development and related scenarios interestingly compared to the hydro climatic projections the socio economic scenarios show a smaller range on variability of water availability as seen in fig 6 the four selected socio economic scenarios have similar impacts on total runoff within the individual climate scenario differences in descriptors shown in fig 6 are based on the four quantitative descriptors implemented in the modelling from table 5 urban population water infrastructure domestic demand and agricultural demand the bau scenario is not based on the socio economic scenarios than rather on the current trend and is generally related to the highest discharge nevertheless we expect the other socio economic scenarios to be more representative of future development as they show possible future pathways including socio economic factors such as increase or decrease of demand connected to a wholesome study of descriptors as the descriptors determine potential increasing unchanged or decreasing domestic and agricultural water use their tendencies have considerable influence on future water availability s12 and s23 behave very similar while s22 and s28 show a slightly different discharge compared to s12 and s23 figs 6 and 7 scenario s22 reports the highest water availability the large export oriented agriculture foster the improvement and expansion of water infrastructure with high efficiencies and limited losses even with immigration from other regions the improved water infrastructure linked with high cultural awareness and water prices that support infrastructure domestic water use remains low as a result the total water demand can still be supported by the reduced water supply the opposite would be true for s28 where the discharge is slightly lower due to the higher demand of agriculture as traditional small scale agriculture is inefficient due to high losses in infiltration caused by flooding from gravitational irrigation and poorly preserved channels agriculture demands almost 54 of total water demand ana 2015 and therefore is a controlling factor of water availability further the population has little to now environmental awareness e g to conserve water combined with weak organizations that implement water policies there are no fees for water usage the interests of the actors in the relevant sector industry energy agriculture etc guide water policy with no coordination and cooperation over water usage which results in conflicts over the use of water resources all of which result in a high domestic water demand s12 and s23 might have the same tendencies of the trajectory of domestic and agricultural water demand constant however if looked in more detail on the descriptors they are driven by differing socio economic developments as described the socio economic drivers of the five selected scenarios differ which results in the difference of water demand for domestic and agriculture and therefore in future water availability for a more detailed description of the tendencies of the descriptors see table 1 of the supplement the relative change for the future discharge 2040 2050 compared to current 2005 2015 levels shows that annual discharge as a function of water supply and demand based on the gcms and scenarios is generally increasing which is also true for the wet season discharge however the dry season discharge is decreasing substantially across all climatic and socio economic scenarios dry season discharge decreases by up to 60 s28 for condorcerro yet this has to be put in context as the dry season discharge is low due to very low precipitation input so relative changes are preponderate this implies that for a mean discharge of 20 m3 s this would result in 12 m3 s less water available in the percentage comparison we can also see the differences among the socio economic scenario being smaller than among the climate scenarios driven by the different gcms the annual differences of the socio economic scenarios are only in the order of a few percent from the lowest to the highest discharge however for the dry season discharge the differences among socio economic scenarios substantially increase by up to 30 for the same climate model indicating the high sensitivity of the dry season to socio economic change related water demand taking a closer look at inter catchment differences we separated the mostly glacier dominated la balsa from the greater condorcerro catchment the differences in discharge and water availability between the larger condorcerro catchment and la balsa are significant see figs 6 and 7 even though the total discharge volume and mean annual discharge is about half of that of condorcerro la balsa shows a different pattern the future scenarios show a decrease of total discharge below the current level also mean annual discharge for all gcms is decreasing below the current discharge the annual wet and dry season discharge decreases with the dry season discharge showing the largest changes relative change for s28 is between 75 and 96 negative difference in dry season discharge compared to the current level in order to eliminate the variability of the precipitation signals of the gcms we added a scenario that assumed precipitation to be unchanging precipitation patterns and volume for the future scenarios and only changed temperature according to the gcms this implies a higher relative importance of temperature dependent drivers of river runoff such as glacier melt or evapotranspiration our results see supplement fig 3 show that there would be no significant change for annual discharge for the condorcerro catchment however wet season discharge would slightly increase while the dry season discharge would decrease discharge for la balsa however shows a decrease in annual discharge due to the greater glaciated basin extent as well as a decrease in wet and dry season discharge decrease of dry season water availability is driven by a combination of diminishing glacier discharge and increasing water demand both of which adopt a major role in the absence of considerable precipitation inputs in this simulation however the signal of the socio economic scenarios is more pronounced with differences in decreases of up to 9 wet season and up to 20 dry season 4 discussion the objectives of our study were i to develop an interdisciplinary model framework for assessing future water supply and demand for the santa river catchment in peru which should ii represent a useful tool for the analysis of the different components determining water availability i e water supply and demand capable to support local water management and iii to determine future water availability in the santa river catchment to aid leveraging actions for adaptation in the water sector conceptually and in its simplest form a model framework for water supply and demand is straightforward a certain quantity of water needs to be extracted from the hydrological model at certain points in the catchment in practice and reality however things are much more complex the interactions between water supply and demand are dynamic over space and time for instance whether to what extent and over which time extracted water enters again runoff generating ground and surface water depends among other on the type of water use domestic agricultural industrial these processes are insufficiently measured and understood in particular for data scarce and poorly monitored regions in the developing world another major challenge is missing information and data on the amount and location of water demand and extraction furthermore a model framework that is able to assess future water supply and demand needs to rely on plausible scenarios for the future integrating both climatic and socio economic conditions for the next decades here we have put major efforts into collection and analysis of available data and co development of future socio economic scenarios with stakeholders our model results quantify the effect of different socio economic drivers and their tendencies for future water availability as we use different key variables such as governmental structures welfare water policies and cultural awareness in our cib analysis to develop our future projections our approach aligns with efforts of socio hydrology facilitating a more holistic perspective of water supply and demand carey et al 2017 wesselink et al 2017 the stakeholder workshop in 2018 allowed a validation of the initial results a key aspect in socio hydrological theory di baldassarre et al 2016 even more the workshop did not only identify possible future scenarios but also captured the expectations and perspectives of stakeholders and policymakers about feasible scenarios a main challenge thereby is the translation of qualitative data from approaches like ours to quantitative data that can be used as input to hydrological models important information such as related to welfare and inequality government or cultural awareness was not directly included in the model but represents explanatory factors for the changes in water demand although other approaches in socio hydrology like agent based modelling wens et al 2019 or multi agent network dermody et al 2018 cover feedbacks and other factors related to decision making the high diversity of stakeholders and cultural approaches on water management represent a limitation for large scale simulations of these models in the last years several studies have used a combination of the ssps shared socioeconomic pathways and rcps to comprehensively evaluate climatic and socioeconomic scenarios bijl et al 2016 mouratiadou et al 2016 wada et al 2016 however the ssps were developed without explicit assumptions for the water sector graham et al 2018 in addition the ssps work on a global or regional scale therefore their downscaling on catchment scale requests assumptions that incorporate additional uncertainties in this context consistency between climate and socio economic scenarios becomes relevant our socio economic scenarios include a climate change descriptor a1 a3 related to extremes flood drought which was an important aspect for the stakeholders during the workshop and represents a complementary aspect as compared to the climate scenarios which were analyzed for annual and seasonal changes but not short term extremes overall we think that our model framework combining a lumped hydrological model and the cib method for socio economic scenario development a in a region of societal diversity and scarce hydroclimatic data availability can be a viable option in similar regions the limited amount and quality of data available was in fact one of the major challenges to implement our model framework and put it in value for support of local water management considering that many regions in the world with similar current and future problems of water scarcity suffer from similar issues viviroli et al 2020 su et al 2022 we analyze this aspect here in more detail one of our major concerns regarding data scarcity is for example that observed discharge data contains gaps in the measurements and had to be infilled thus inevitably introducing some degree of error for the future we had to deal with uncertainties concerning timing and quantity of precipitation given by the underlying climate models for instance some of the scenarios in our integrated water balance model show a decrease of water availability from rcp2 6 to rcp8 5 while others indicate an increase large divergence of rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 mainly occurs post 2050 and therefore greater changes are expected under rcp8 5 until 2100 the variability of the hydro climatic signal is still rather high and does not show a common trend this is possibly due to the fact that rcms at cordex type resolution can still exhibit biases such as the underestimation of temperature at different altitudes of mountains and the overestimation of precipitation over mountain regions in association with unresolved topographic forcing which remains too smoothed over the complex terrain of the andes pabón caicedo et al 2020 gcms have very limited ability to adequately simulate precipitation variability and trends due to the distinct small scaled topographic features that are not adequately resolved because of the poor resolution of the gcms and the complex dynamic influence on local climate buytaert et al 2010 minvielle and garreaud 2011 vuille et al 2008 therefore higher resolution regional climate models coupled with glacier models are necessary to better project future climate changes and their impacts on tropical andean glaciers and associated runoff vuille et al 2008 while variability and uncertainty in precipitation projections for this region can currently hardly be substantially reduced the projections for temperature bear less uncertainty and translate directly into relatively robust glacier melt and loss water demand quantification is also affected by limited availability of data and across the different users domestic agriculture mining and industry this challenges the water supply and demand interaction as we cannot say with high precision how much water is being consumed more government and research efforts therefore should be directed to water demand measurements monitoring and analysis as the water demand is important for the local policy level to determine where actions can be taken in line with this for future research adaptation planning and policy initiatives we suggest strong capacity building and investments into hydro climatic and water demand monitoring including participatory approaches such as citizen science initiatives these have an increasing application potential in the region particularly to deal with high uncertainties by increasing spatio temporal data availability and reduce conflict potentials by including local communities and stakeholders into research and water management practices buytaert et al 2014 muñoz et al 2021 overall while this analysis to our knowledge represents the most comprehensive assessment available so far for the region there is a need for further development and evaluation of such methods many of these data limited regions have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to climate change due to human natural vulnerabilities such as sensitive ecosystems poor and marginalized people and livelihoods depending on local climate immerzeel et al 2020 mcdowell et al 2019 notwithstanding the data limitations our model framework and study is able to provide key information regarding current and future water availability and their controlling factors in order to support local water management and adaptation first our results show that the model simulates the observed seasonal cycle of river discharge reasonably well with increasing water availability at annual scale until 2050 for the condorcerro catchment where runoff is more rainfall dominated for the dry season however we observe a decline in water availability correlated with decreasing glacier discharge and an exacerbated seasonal hydrological cycle positive future precipitation trends as suggested in our study based on cordex data for the wet season are in line with other studies analyzing regional climate models for peru and the tropical andes region olsson et al 2017 urrutia and vuille 2009 van soesbergen and mulligan 2018 vera et al 2006 trends for the past decades 1983 2012 based on station data confirm increasing precipitation trends in the order of 60 mm decade for the cordillera blanca since the 1980 s schauwecker et al 2014 however as seen the topography of the andes poses a major challenge to precipitation projections and other studies reported decreasing precipitation trends for the 21st century chou et al 2014 neukom et al 2015 an important result is that climate change exerts a higher influence on future water availability than socio economic changes this result however is specific for the study catchment and cannot be generalized for other catchments in the andes or beyond as it is a result of the characteristic water supply and demand dynamics of the santa river area to gain further insights into the socio economic drivers we performed model simulations where we removed the precipitation change signal the scenarios then show a pronounced divergence and water availability and runoff are reduced by increasing domestic and especially agricultural water demand given the inconsistencies in agricultural water demand numbers we found as reported by different state agencies we ran model simulations with up to 3 mm day water demand corresponding to about 12 000 m3 ha year as an estimated upper bound value this results in future discharge volumes being significantly lower and below the current volumes the mean annual discharge would decrease then for simulations with 4 out of 5 gcms the dry season discharge would decrease by up to 80 for condorcerro and would be very sensitive to the increasing agricultural demand see supplement figs 4 and 5 for the la balsa catchment and the local water availability this could have severe consequences with half the water volume available and more severe dry season conditions overall hence all scenario combinations indicate a substantial decrease in water availability for the dry season and importantly show that the conditions in the dry season are very sensitive to either climatic or socio economic changes in the future juen et al 2007 motschmann et al 2020 the drivers of change are diverse and interdependent and hence there is no single driver of socio economic change water availability and scarcity but rather a combination of many water demand from agricultural or domestic use can be driven by factors such as governmental long term strategies and water policies or cultural awareness of the population we provided a list of key hydro climatic and socio economic drivers in the glacierized santa catchment and elaborated on future developments of these key drivers using a participatory scenario construction and validation method that integrates a diverse group of stakeholders including local water use and decision making aspects and scientific expert knowledge we expect those socio economic scenarios to cover a realistic image of future water availability this participatory approach allows for discussing socio economic scenarios with local actors and involves them within the research process this first effort to co produce integrated water resource scenarios identifying key drivers of change should be further used for the development of locally tailored and feasible adaptation strategies to meet the challenges of future water problems the conditions of the santa river are comparable to many other regions of the tropical andes with importance of glacial meltwater contribution for downstream water use e g buytaert et al 2017 and substantial changes in socio economic development such as in several high andean catchments of bolivia e g water availability for la paz soruco et al 2015 and ecuador e g water supply for quito pouget et al 2015 therefore our results suggest that efforts in integrated water resource management to avoid severe conditions of water scarcity need to be substantially increased in the region water governance plays a central role in the catchment but faces important challenges related to diverse interests and perceptions and power inequalities of and among actors and stakeholders drenkhan et al 2015 lynch 2012 in fact water allocation and water usage have been identified as the main factors driving water scarcity carey et al 2017 drenkhan et al 2015 mark et al 2017 paerregaard 2018 vuille et al 2018 water infrastructure requires important investments to reduce water losses in the future particularly during drought conditions and to counteract increases in water demand finally in consideration of the projected increasing imbalance between wet season and dry season water availability development of new water storage capacities could be a feasible option however additional water storage needs to be carefully planned to avoid further social conflicts and the fact that an over reliance on water infrastructure might increase human vulnerabilities and even lead to increased water shortage often referred to the reservoir effect di baldassarre et al 2018 recent studies have pointed to the potential synergies between water users and decision makers integrating water management flood disaster prevention and hydropower generation in overarching projects with important co benefits such water reservoirs require participatory planning and implementation as multi purpose infrastructure drenkhan et al 2019 haeberli et al 2016 haeberli and drenkhan 2022 5 conclusion in this study we present an approach of interdisciplinary water resource research combining hydro climatic modelling with socio economic scenarios to deal with the complexity of coupled human natural systems the model aims to develop integrative scenarios by exploring the uncertainty of future hydrological climatic social economic and political change in the highly glaciated santa river catchment by 2050 these drivers are then combined into consistent descriptions of possible future developments results show an increase of water availability at annual scale by 2050 consistent across several gcms and for both low rcp 2 6 and high rcp8 5 emission scenarios and for different socio economic scenarios the increase is mainly driven by higher precipitation inputs during the wet season in contrast dry season water availability is projected to substantially decrease by more than 50 mainly due to reduced glacier melt in combination with increasing water demand and an enhanced seasonal hydrological cycle at annual scale results suggest that the hydro climatic factors have a higher effect on water availability than socioeconomic factors in the study region yet this has to be put in context as low dry season discharge is controlled by very low precipitation inputs at annual scale the differences among the socio economic scenarios are mainly within a few percent of discharge value however for dry season discharge the differences among socio economic scenarios substantially increase by up to 30 within each climate model indicating high sensitivity to changing water demand during the dry season this underlines the importance of investments and improvement in water management and climate change adaptation to avoid seasonal periods of water scarcity in the future in data scarce regions such as the andes of peru limited quality and availability of data introduces additional uncertainty to model results and projections it is important to distinguish between data and model derived uncertainties on the one hand and the scenario related range of possible future outcomes on the other hand the range of projected water availability is a function of the different emission climate and socio economic scenarios uncertainties derive from missing or low quality measurements of climatic and hydrologic variables complex topography that climate models cannot adequately resolve and from unavailable or inconsistent water use data based on our model results we suggest strong capacity building and investments into hydro climatic and water demand monitoring which should include more participatory approaches such as citizen science initiatives the projected reinforcement in seasonal water availability found in this study highlights the need to adequately consider spatio temporal scales within multi scenario water balance models to support local decision making our results elucidate the urgent need for improvements in water infrastructure and related efficiencies future water storage planning and implementation should consider an integrated inclusive and participatory process where synergies can be generated between water reservoir management disaster risk reduction and energy production this is likely a robust finding and claim not only for our study region in the andes of peru

7950,study region santa river basin peru study focus in the andes of peru climate change and socio economic development are expected to jeopardize future water availability however little is known about the interplay of multiple climatic and non climatic stressors and related processes driving water resource changes we developed an integrated model that analyzes different trajectories of water availability including hydro climatic water supply and socio economic water demand variables with consistent multi descriptor future scenarios until 2050 new hydrological insights for the region at the lower basin outflow of condorcerro mean annual water availability is projected to increase by 10 12 by 2050 this gain is mainly driven by an increase in annual precipitation amounts of about 14 rcp2 6 and 18 rcp8 5 respectively which was computed using a global climate multi model ensemble in contrast mean dry season water availability is projected to substantially decrease by 33 and 36 24 by 2050 for rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 respectively this decline is driven by a combination of diminishing glacier discharge and increasing water demand both of which adopt a major role in the absence of considerable precipitation inputs these seasonal differences highlight the need to adequately consider spatiotemporal scales within multi scenario water balance models to support local decision making our results elucidate the need for improvements in water management and infrastructure to counteract diminishing dry season water availability and to reduce future risks of water scarcity graphical

per capita future water demand models are challenged to go beyond these estimates more socio hydrological approaches are needed that integrate actions of societies governments and politics including how they manage available water as societies and how politics influence the hydrological cycle linton and budds 2014 paerregaard 2018 pande et al 2022 as water is regulated through local institutions the modeling of future water systems is more complex due to the current structures with multiple competing water uses multiple actors formal and informal rules both temporally and spatially that might outweigh local climate change impacts this challenge needs to be addressed by more interdisciplinary and holistic approaches reynard et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 zimmer et al 2021 the cordillera

climate change on water resources van soesbergen and mulligan 2018 and human vulnerabilities buytaert and bievre 2012 lynch 2012 the santa river catchment draining the cordillera blanca to the pacific is also a site where socio hydrological studies have started to emerge underyling the importance of the social realm for water resources in the region carey et al 2014 however quantitative studies integrating both water supply and demand based on rigorous climatic and socio economic scenarios are rare in the andes region only a few studies have investigated current and future water supply at monthly scale in the santa river catchment ana 2015 condom et al 2012 vergara et al 2011 but further insights particularly on patterns of current and future water demand remain both temporally and spatially not sufficiently quantified and understood comprehensive quantitative analyses of water resources including supply and demand in climate sensitive mountain regions are often limited by data scarcity and the complexity of climate change drivers rasul and molden 2019 global and regional studies are not detailed enough to show the causes and impacts of water deficit at the local level nevertheless there is a strong demand from policy makers for projections about the potential impacts of climate change on water resources within integrated environmental models combining climatic and hydrologic models buytaert et al 2009 despite considerable uncertainties related to future development and data scarcity current and future water management and robust adaptation planning require future water modeling outputs by developing meaningful scenarios for the mid next decades and long term beyond 2050 recognizing the importance of the santa river catchment in a regional andes context this study aims at developing an interdisciplinary model framework for assessing future water supply and demand until 2050 by combining hydro climatic modelling and socio economic scenarios for the santa river catchment in the andes of peru our model framework is intended to represent a useful tool for the analysis of the different components determining current and future water availability and thus supporting local decision making of mid term future water management under limited data availability and associated uncertainties in the following we use the term water supply and water demand to refer to the hydro climatic and socio economic components respectively and water availability to point to the integrated function of combined water supply and demand 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the santa river catchment in central peru which drains parts of the glaciated cordillera blanca in the western andes more specifically we divide the santa river catchment into two sub catchments down to the gauge stations la balsa 1880 m asl 4800 km² and condorcerro 477 m asl which together cover about 90 of the entire santa river catchment 10 400 km² following strong precipitation seasonality the santa river shows high discharge variability with up to 300 m³ s in the wet season november april and down to 25 m³ s during the dry season june september at condorcerro with a total glacier area of about 280 km² the upper sub catchment la balsa covers a major part of the cordillera blanca glaciers which have lost about 38 of their area from 726 km² in 1962 449 km² in 2016 inaigem 2018 particularly in headwaters and during the dry season glacial meltwater has an important role with a relative contribution to river discharge of up to 67 at la balsa condom et al 2012 peak water i e the point at which long term river runoff is decreasing and streamflow variability is increasing due to subsequently vanishing glaciers has likely been passed in several sub catchments of la balsa baraer et al 2012 the decline in meltwater contribution and acid rock drainage from recently exposed glacial sediments have triggered deterioration of water quality in some sub catchments of the santa river santofimia et al 2017 zimmer et al 2021 and might thus exacerbate water scarcity and pressure over water resource use in the catchment carey et al 2014 drenkhan et al 2015 the upper santa river catchment is home to about 650 000 people with huaraz 119 000 inhabitants being by far the largest city and most important center for local markets and mountain tourism inei 2017 furthermore about half 49 of all inhabitants in the region do not have access to secure drinking water via the public network which considerably exceeds the national average of 34 inei 2018 low socioeconomic development and water insecurity in the santa river catchment can be translated into high vulnerabilities and exposure of people and assets particularly in remote regions with weak infrastructure and governmental incidence drenkhan et al 2015 condorcerro represents the control gauge station for the large scale agricultural export industry at the dry pacific coast chinecas áncash region and chavimochic la libertad region which are mostly supplied by santa water via huge interbasin transfers in the order of 35 45 m³ s both projects compete over limited water allocation from the santa river and represent an important regional employer for instance chavimochic hosts 46 9 km² of high value export crops and offers 66 000 jobs in the region drenkhan et al 2015 its current production scheme requires around 597 million m3 of annual water resources from which 87 is covered by the santa river via a single intake canal at 412 m asl below condorcerro future projections of water demand considering crop area extension of 66 km² towards 2050 suggest potentially severe water deficit aste cannock 2018 related to economic growth the total installed energy capacity in peru has nearly doubled from 8 0 gw in 2009 to 15 2 gw in 2019 and is to a large extent sustained by hydropower which has grown from 3 3 gw to 5 4 gw in the same period minem 2020 the total installed hydropower capacity in the santa river catchment includes around 401 mw which is mainly backed by cañon del pato 263 mw and quitaracsa plants 118 mw in peru several hydropower plant extensions are underway but their planning and construction is highly contentious and might be unfeasible in several cases for instance lake parón situated in the la balsa catchment has been subject to an emblematic social conflict where multiple water users e g the community cruz de mayo and the cañon del pato operator duke energy compete over water control due to a lack of governmental water governance and exclusion from decision making carey et al 2012 peru s water governance framework is in a transition with the implementation of the new water resources law in 2009 which aims at integrated water resources management iwrm on the long term drenkhan et al 2015 this fundamental paradigm change consists of a stepwise decentralization of water management functions and an integration of multiple stakeholders by means of regional water resources basin councils nonetheless institutional fragilities exclusion of water users from decision making and ongoing water conflicts hamper these efforts carey et al 2012 drenkhan et al 2015 lynch 2012 this is also true for the santa river catchment where until date no water resources basin council has been implemented owed to the complex situation of weak water governance and ongoing social conflicts despite of considerable financial and institutional efforts drenkhan et al 2015 mark et al 2017 data scarcity and inconsistencies coupled with complex process interactions and thus limited knowledge and process understanding are challenging climate change and water related studies in the andes condom et al 2020 huggel et al 2015 the above outlined complex interplay of highly seasonal water availability data limitations and cascading effects from climate change impacts and socioeconomic development confers to the santa river catchment a crucial role to explore future water availability for coupled social environmental systems under consideration of high uncertainties and the need for climate change adaptation 2 2 hydro climatic data and climate scenarios the study is based on an interdisciplinary approach combining the key variables of water supply hydro climatic data and demand socio economic data in order to assess the future development of water availability of the santa river due to the data scarcity in the study area we had to make a number of assumptions and simplifications for the input data and the development of the integrated water balance model for example data for irrigation water demand was only available on administrative units for individual years with no further information on specific abstraction points this also applies to the modelling of hydrological processes as reliable discharge time series are only available for the two gauges in the study area preventing a more detailed analysis in smaller sub catchments for this reason the socio economic water demand scenarios and corresponding quantifications are developed for la balsa and condorcerro catchments the hydrological modelling is carried out using a lumped conceptual model the data basis for the socio economic and hydro climatic scenarios and the implementation of these data in the model are described in the following sections 2 2 1 historical observations 1981 2015 for the model calibration for the period from 1981 to 2015 gridded historical data for temperature and precipitation of the peruvian interpolated data of the senamhi s climatological and hydrological observations pisco was used the data is available on a 0 1 10 km resolution on a daily and monthly time scale the gridded dataset represents the only spatially and temporally continuous climatic database at this scale available in peru it is based on three different data sources which all exhibit certain weaknesses aybar et al 2020 the in situ gauges have large data gaps and inconsistencies and the remote sensing precipitation estimates from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps show biases especially on shorter time scales aybar et al 2020 mantas et al 2015 rivera et al 2018 scheel et al 2011 furthermore only seven rain gauges used for the pisco dataset are situated within the santa catchment which is insufficient for capturing the full detail of spatio temporal precipitation variability on a daily basis because of these shortages there are concerns about pisco precipitation data being used for precipitation trends extreme events or other applications related to e g climate change aybar et al 2020 nevertheless this data set has been successfully used in other studies in peru e g imfeld et al 2020 laudien et al 2020 in our study we are interested in the monthly water balance rather than short term extremes aybar et al 2020 asseses the dataset as suitable for water balance evaluations in this area the mean monthly temperature was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration etp using the method from oudin et al 2005 for each pisco grid cell within the catchment in situ discharge measurements provided by local hydropower agencies are available for the gauges la balsa and condorcerro the time series cover the years 1981 2015 however the data is incomplete for some years especially for the gauge la balsa therefore missing data was infilled using a copula based approach which was presented by bárdossy and pegram 2014 this approach depends on correlation between neighboring observations and uses copulas to infill missing hydro meteorological data based on a conditional distribution that gives the interval in which the missing value is expected to lay the infilling method showed reliable results for monthly discharges with a nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 86 and 0 89 for la balsa and condorcerro respectively table 1 gives an overview of the data used for historical and future time periods 2 2 2 future climate scenarios downscaling and disaggregation for simulating future discharge fig 4 we used precipitation and temperature data from the cordex simulations for south america cordex org with an ensemble of five driving general circulation models gcms ichec ec earth miroc miroc5 mpi m mpi esm lr ncc noresm1 m mohc hadgem2 es that were used by the regional climate model rca4 at 0 5 spatial resolution future projections were modelled for the representative concentration pathways rcps rcp2 6 and 8 5 as these indicate the low and high end of global temperature increase cordex data is available on daily and monthly time scale daily historic climate scenarios for the catchment area are not capable of adequately reproducing the quantity and temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation whereas the monthly data were found more reliable however the monthly data also showed bias and needed to be bias corrected before further use we bias corrected and downscaled future monthly precipitation and temperature data to the pisco grid cells 0 1 using a quantile quantile transformation qq transformation piani et al 2010 for this method the quantiles are formed from both the observed and the simulated data and plotted against each other this allows to derive a transfer function which can be used to correct the modeled data since our integrated water balance model runs on a daily resolution to account for the hydrological processes the monthly precipitation and temperature cordex data was disaggregated to daily data to account for the high temporal and spatial precipitation variability in the study region mourre et al 2015 seidel et al 2019 a stochastic approach for disaggregation of the monthly precipitation data using a first order markov chain model was applied for each pisco grid cell a day with precipitation 1 mm is considered wet otherwise it is defined as dry the transition probabilities for wet and dry days were calculated based on the daily pisco precipitation dataset to account for the distinct annual cycle in precipitation the transition probabilities for each grid cell were calculated for each day using a linear weighted 31 day moving window based on these transition probabilities the markov model was used to generate sequences of wet and dry days for each pisco grid cell in order to preserve a certain spatial correlation a cholesky decomposition was applied to create spatially correlated random numbers for the markov model for disaggregating the cordex precipitation data we assume that these transitions probabilities will remain constant for the time period 2021 2050 the disaggregation of the monthly cordex precipitation is based on the number of wet days generated from the markov model precipitation values for these wet days drawn from the distribution function based on daily pisco data for each month and a scaling factor k with which the precipitation values are adjusted to the monthly sum the scaling factor k is calculated as follows k i j 0 n f i x j m i where f i x is the distribution function of precipitation values for the month i based on the pisco data from 1981 2015 n i are number of wet days simulated from the markov model for the month i and m i is the monthly precipitation from cordex for 2021 2050 the daily precipitation values for each month are then adjusted with the scaling ki factor such that pcp i j f i x j k i for j 1 n where pcp i j is the adjusted value for day j since temperatures and potential evapotranspiration have much less spatio temporal variability than precipitation the disaggregation was performed by distributing the monthly values equally over all days fig 2 shows the projected temperature and precipitation based on the above described process on average the gcms used for the cordex runs indicate a mean annual temperature increase by 2 c over pre industrial levels rcp2 6 and by 3 c rcp8 5 and an increase of annual precipitation sum by 14 rcp2 6 and by 18 rcp8 5 by 2040 2050 as compared to 2005 2015 the historic and future glacier runoff was simulated using the gsm model from rs minerve garcía hernández et al 2016 gsm is a temperature index glacier melt model that uses precipitation temperature and glacier surface to simulate glacier runoff the model uses different temperature thresholds to separate solid and liquid precipitation and snow and ice melting in addition a sinusoidal function allows to simulate the snow and ice melt seasonality which is highly important in the tropical andes the model results were assessed by looking at both the seasonal melting maximum glacier runoff around december and minimum values around august and mass balance which was compared with estimations from dussaillant et al 2019 for the historic period we used the pisco data and historic glacier outlines see table 1 while for the future period we used the biased corrected cordex data and the glacier outlines based on the method proposed by schauwecker et al 2017 gcms are apt to provide a broad perspective vuille et al 2008 but some important aspects need to be considered although the simulation of large scale patterns of precipitation has improved since the ipcc 4th assessment report in 2007 gcms continue to perform less well for precipitation than for surface temperature at regional scales assessment of precipitation simulations often remains difficult due to observational uncertainties flato et al 2013 further gcms show inconsistencies in the sign and magnitude of precipitation change including for many parts of the tropical andes where they widely disagree on the direction and magnitude of the change in precipitation buytaert et al 2010 2009 wijngaard et al 2018 in order to eliminate the variability of the precipitation signals from the gcms we added an additional scenario with the same future precipitation patterns and totals as the current precipitation for this individual years from the pisco daily precipitation data were randomly assigned to a year in the future simulation period 2021 2050 and only the temperature was taken from the cordex data 2 3 socio economic data and methodology domestic water use small and large scale agriculture hydropower and mining are the main drivers of water demand in the santa valley drenkhan et al 2015 in this study we particularly focus on the future development of domestic and agricultural demand which are the largest and most important drivers of human water demand in the basin and the related impact on water availability we started by using basic parameters that describe the water demand for domestic and agricultural purposes therefore we used data of population domestic water consumption and agricultural area as well as agricultural water demand population data was derived from the census data of the peruvian statistics institute inei for the years 1993 2007 and 2017 inei 2017 2007 1993 which provides the number of inhabitants for the districts as well as population projections until 2025 for the ancash region the average current water consumption of the population of huaraz and caraz is around 180 l capita day this number of domestic water demand is derived from the local water provider eps chavin for the year 2016 and also based on data of drenkhan et al 2019 agricultural area was taken from the inei census at district level for 1994 and 2012 inei 2012 1994 noting that for some districts the spatial delimitations of administrative districts does not match with the catchment area agricultural demand is based on ana 2012 which estimates the demand for the santa river catchment in the order of 526 million m3 of water for the year 2012 this data was used to estimate the historical water demand from 1981 to 2015 at a monthly time step then the historical water demand simulation was included in the hydrological model to simulate the total runoff 2 3 1 socio economic scenarios the future water demand is based on socio economic scenarios in order to evaluate the possible future tendencies of water demand we developed scenarios of societal and technological change to understand the complex interplay between these fields and to describe possible future developments of society political factors infrastructure and the environment for the future water situation in the santa river basin in 2050 these scenarios are developed using cross impact balance analysis cib www cross impact org offering a basis to discuss the robustness of concepts transformation pathways interventions and technology assessments as well as risks and uncertainties weimer jehle 2006 cib is a qualitative method of system analysis a system is qualitatively described and evaluated by key drivers and their interdependencies among themselves using cross impact judgments cib ensures internal consistency of the results and therefore the analysis provides consistent scenarios this method has been used successfully within various sectors including climate change e g schweizer and lazurko 2020 energy e g pregger et al 2020 water e g sharma et al 2020 waste e g saner et al 2011 and others in the water sector in lima peru kosow and león 2015 miranda sara and baud 2014 cib scenarios were used as a basis to formulate an action plan for sustainable urban water management schütze et al 2019 the cib method consists of the following process steps 1 definition of key drivers descriptors 2 description of driver states sub scenarios 3 assessments of interrelations between each driver state cib matrix 4 identification of internally consistent scenarios following this process the first step was to define the socio economic key drivers for the water management of the santa river watershed these key drivers describe the main influencing factors for future water demand in the santa river watershed we refer to them as descriptors these descriptors were identified by consulting relevant documents and by interviewing 15 local experts and stakeholders from different agencies connected to local and regional water management academia public administration from water agriculture business sectors and ngos 1 1 local agencies involved are the peruvian national water authority autoridad nacional del agua ana local water administration administración local del agua ala glaciers and ecosystems research national institute instituto nacional de investigación en glaciares y ecosistemas de montaña inagem ancash

provider of sanitation services for drinking water and sewerage chavín prestadora de servicios de saneamiento de agua potable y alcantarillado chavín eps chavin care peru huascarán national park parque nacional huascarán ombudsman office defensoría del pueblo the stakeholder interviews were conducted in january february and august 2017 in huaraz the second step was to describe possible future developments of each of the descriptors sub scenarios in total 15 descriptors linked to different sub scenarios between 2 and 3 for each descriptor were identified as shown in table 2 their detailed description can be found in table 1 in the supplement in order to systematically analyze the interdependencies between each of the sub scenarios an evaluation was performed using a qualitative concept of cross impact judgments weimer jehle 2006 this method utilizes expert knowledge to assess interrelations between sub scenarios this evaluation took place by conducting interviews with local stakeholders from the study area as described above the interviewees were asked how a certain sub scenario of one descriptor would promote or inhibit the sub scenario of another descriptor this was done for all descriptor sub scenarios and later transformed quantitatively using an impact scale from 3 strongly inhibiting to 3 strongly promoting as a result a cross impact matrix was built see supplement table 3 the water demand descriptors descriptors k l m n were defined as passive descriptors as they receive but do not exert impact onto other descriptor sub scenarios finally to identify internally consistent future scenarios based on the cib algorithm weimer jehle 2006 the free cib software scenariowizard www cross impact org english cib e scw htm was used the software examines all possible combinations of sub scenarios 6 4 million combinations in this case and balances the supports and hindrances indicated by the cross impact matrix that the sub scenarios generate among themselves for each combination the software selects the nash optimal combinations as scenarios nash 1951 i e those combinations in which no descriptor can further improve its net support from the other descriptors by switching to another sub scenario thus each of these scenarios describes a network of self reinforcing developments weimer jehle et al 2020 suppl mat the results of the performed cib analysis are described in chapter 3 2 to validate the scenario analysis results a stakeholder workshop socio economic scenarios for the adaptation and sustainable management of water resources in the santa river basin was organized in august 2018 in huaraz and involved 30 experts and stakeholders from different agencies 2 2 participants ala huaraz ana ugrh eps chavin ancash regional government inaigem indeci mountain institute three basins commonwealth waraq commonwealth huaraz municipality sernanp sunass unasam wayintsik the objectives of the workshop were to i inform about possible future scenarios in the santa river basin by 2050 ii evaluate and discuss the configuration of the scenarios and iii to propose robust adaptation and management initiatives for the scenarios 2 3 2 integration of socio economic and hydro climatic scenarios to combine the socio economic and hydro climatic data we had to convert qualitative socio economic scenarios into time series of water use as the socio economic descriptors are interdependent we quantified and translated them into the hydrological model by using the parameters that define water demand i e population domestic demand agriculture and water infrastructure which are further explained below the interdependencies and likelihood of the socio economic scenarios are expressed by the cib values the likelihood of each development assumed in a socio economic scenario is measured in a semi qualitative way by the impact sum of the respective development while these values will be explained in detail in the result section they allow us to translate the socio economic descriptors into integrated scenarios by using the following parameters population the population change 2021 2050 is based on the population growth for the ancash region provided by inei 2017 which is only provided until 2025 whereas the population change estimation until 2050 is needed in order to fit the data and model we assume that the growth rate after 2025 decreases by 0 01 point corresponding to the rate of increase between 2020 and 2025 after all the population increases for all socio economic scenarios in the model domestic water demand the domestic demand was calculated based on the population we assumed a current state of 180 l capita day and a future state for 2050 of 250 l capita day 20 l for increasing and 120 l capita day 20 l decreasing water corresponding to data from the local water provider for the upper santa eps chavin and drenkhan et al 2019 the cib values are transferred into probabilities for the occurrence of that future development and distribution values were generated into time series until 2050 agriculture depending on the socio economic scenario the agricultural area could increase decrease or stay constant constant refers to the state in the year 2015 for increasing and decreasing development the agriculture areas were changed increased decreased in 5 year steps 2020 2045 the areas are based on the irrigated area provided by inei 1994 and 2012 the growth rate between those years was used to calculate the historical extent of 1980 as well as future extent until 2050 although the growth rate then is projected to be much less than observed for the past years and decades we also distinguished the growth of irrigated area in the glaciated main santa valley down to la balsa which is between 5 and 1 assuming growth rate will decrease for the 5 year steps and in the non glaciated northern part north of la balsa which is between 1 and 2 assuming growth rate will increase as this area is less accessible and populated this results in a different distribution of irrigated agricultural area between the north and the south of the catchment the resulting irrigated area was then multiplied by an irrigation amount of 1 34 mm day which corresponds to 4900 m3 ha year as provided for the santa catchment by ana 2012 consistent with the gridded resolution of temperature and precipitation the spatial irrigation data were used to get a lumped time series note we added a simulation with agricultural water demand of 3 mm day in order to account for increase in agricultural demand or unaccounted non measured water usage results can be found in the supplement water infrastructure water infrastructure such as water channels pipes and water treatment plants is critical for the amount of water that reaches the end user domestic or agricultural consumer however infrastructure in the study region is rather poor we consider water leakages in the order of 45 for the current situation drenkhan et al 2019 kosow et al 2013 liemberger and wyatt 2019 for the future we assume an improvement of infrastructure with reduced leakages at 35 or a deteriorated infrastructure with increased leakages at 55 additionally we assume an uncertainty range of 5 these percentages apply both for domestic and agricultural use for all parameters a time series has been calculated according to possible changes over time the interpolation methods and time steps for interpolation are shown in table 3 depending on the tendencies given in the cib scenarios the model chooses which future development decrease constant increase will be generated in the time series this means the higher the impact sum the higher the probability for the associated future development to occur if constant and increasing have both the same positive impact sum and decreasing has a negative impact sum constant and increasing both have the same probability to occur while decreasing will not occur after the model defined the future development it randomly draws a number for the end point of future development from the given range e g 250 20 l capita the start and end value of the time series is known and with a given function e g linear or a step function the time series are interpolated between start and end value next to the scenarios generated by the cib we added a business as usual scenario bau as baseline in this scenario the demand parameters for the descriptors stay the same for the future as for current i e domestic demand is kept at 180 l capita person population remains constant and agricultural area for the catchment is around 123 000 ha and water demand equivalent to 1 34 mm day we use this scenario to first show the effects of changes of the hydro climatic parameters as related to the gcms and underlying emission scenarios rcps later on we compare it to the socio economic scenarios of the cibs except for the bau scenario all scenario model runs were repeated 50 times for each model run a new possible time series for domestic demand and water infrastructure was generated as described above this allows us to address the uncertainty of the future water demand 2 4 integrated water balance model for the integration of the hydro climatic and socio economic data and scenarios we build an integrated water balance model to simulate water discharge as an integrated function of both water supply and demand the model is based on a variation of the conceptual daily rainfall runoff model hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning bergström 1992 1976 which models the discharge of a catchment using precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration since the hbv model does not simulate runoff from glacier areas the runoff from these areas was simulated separately using the gsm model from rs minerve modelling framework as described above garcía hernández et al 2016 and added as input to the hbv model additionally routines to simulate water demand based on agricultural and domestic water consumption data were included the hbv model is set up with two separate hydrological response units hrus fig 2 in each sub catchment to account for irrigated agricultural areas on the one hand and rain fed agricultural and non agricultural areas on the other the total daily water demand is subtracted from the runoff and fed back into the model by means of two feedback loops one feedback loop simulates the agricultural demand for irrigation and is included in hru 2 the irrigation water is added as additional soil moisture with time lapse of one day from here it is either entering the reservoirs of the model or leaving the system over evapotranspiration the second feedback loop for domestic demand is included in hru 1 since waste water is usually drained into the river most of the demand water in the model is flowing back to the discharge with a modeled time lapse of one day for both agriculture and domestic demand a portion of the water is lost through the infrastructure with a time lapse of one day due to leakage or inefficiency into the upper reservoir two time periods were simulated a historical period from 1981 to 2015 and a future period from 2021 to 2050 using the climate rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 and socio economic scenarios the model is running on daily time step but the final results were assessed on a monthly basis the model was cross validated for the two periods 1981 1995 and 2000 2014 the calibration was done simultaneously for both sub catchments for the period 1981 1995 and validated with the period 2000 2014 and vice versa for calibration the differential evolution de optimization method was used storn and price 1997 the results of the calibration were assessed for monthly discharge time series using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and the log nash sutcliffe model efficiency lognse coefficient the model performance results and calibration parameters are shown in table 4 as well as in the supplement table 2 and supplement figs 1 and 2 respectively the calibrated parameters are listed in supplement table 2 3 results 3 1 climate change scenarios historic and future water supply first we report on the hydro climatic part and related water supply without considering the socio economic water demand part fig 4 shows the mean annual discharge for the historic 1981 2015 and future 2021 2050 time periods for annual dry season and wet season for rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 based on the bau socio economic scenario we noticed a lag of response of one month in the discharge values as compared to the wet and dry seasons of precipitation therefore we used the months july august and september jas representative for the dry season discharge and january february and march jfm for the wet season discharge our results show important differences between the middle and lower catchment parts la balsa and condorcerro respectively in terms of changes in water availability for the entire catchments represented by the condorcerro gauge mean annual discharge is projected to increase until 2050 as compared to the historic baseline which is mainly driven by increasing precipitation fig 2 and an increase in runoff in the wet season jfm figs 4 and 5 in contrast model results indicate a strong decrease of discharge for the dry season in condorcerro the variability among the different gcm s is considerable for annual wet and dry season discharge for the upper santa catchment la balsa the picture is different annual discharge is projected to decrease over the next decades while the wet season shows a tendency towards discharge decrease but with a pronounced variability among climate models the dry season however shows a very strong decrease in discharge which is consistent across climate models fig 6 for la balsa we also analyzed glacial meltwater changes in absolute terms and relative to total discharge supplement table 4 at annual scale glacial meltwater decreases both in absolute and relative terms as compared to current 4 and historic 8 conditions the same is true for the wet season and in both cases for rcp8 5 meltwater decrease is slightly stronger compared to current 5 and historic 10 conditions than for rcp2 6 4 and 9 respectively for the dry season glacial meltwater decreases in absolute terms however due to projected decreasing precipitation inputs relative contribution of glacial meltwater would increase by 29 rcp2 6 to 35 rcp8 5 compared to current conditions hence the reliance on glacier meltwater during the dry season becomes even more important in the next decades 3 2 socio economic scenarios the cib analysis generated 29 consistent scenarios s1 to s29 that represent the possible alternative pathways of future socio economic development as a function of water governance regime and temperature and precipitation change see supplement table 5 in the condorcerro catchment from a total of 29 scenarios five were selected for the subsequent modelling because these are the most diverging scenarios that differ within the relevant descriptors see table 3 finally only four scenarios were chosen for the integrated modelling as s8 has overlapping input parameters with s12 see table 3 nevertheless we wanted to highlight the scenario as it has a difference to s12 regarding socio political factors s8 s12 s23 and s28 were discussed in detail in the stakeholder workshop in 2018 in huaraz while s22 was added due to its different sub scenario where the agricultural demand is decreasing the different combinations of descriptor sub scenarios for each of the selected five scenarios can be seen in table 5 as mentioned previously the descriptors may influence each other and some are interdependent this means that they can have either a promoting positive or an inhibiting negative effect for example whether domestic water demand descriptor k is decreasing constant or increasing depends on population welfare and inequality water policies water pricing and cultural awareness furthermore these different socio economic descriptor developments all together can either foster or hinder the tendency of how future demand would develop assuming for example that as shown in scenario s28 domestic water demand would increase k1 emigration b3 could potentially offset that increase as could a decline in gdp and increasing inequality c3 weak sectorial water policies f2 a water pricing scheme that doesn t include investment and operational costs g3 and low cultural awareness within the population for saving water h3 on the other hand would increase water demand however as there are fostering and hindering impacts towards domestic water demand development this does not only depend on one descriptor impact but on the sum of positive and negative impacts these tendencies are described in the cib algorithm by impact sums since the individual descriptors in the socio economic scenarios influence each other it allows to focus on certain descriptors k l the impact sum provides an indicator whether a sub scenario is likely or not it further allows to quantify the socio economic scenarios therefore we use the descriptors that can be quantified such as domestic and agricultural demand population and water infrastructure where we can find quantitative data table 5 chapter 3 2 a closer look at the scenarios s8 and s12 indicates that some descriptors have the same tendency this certainly leads to similar results for the discharge generated by the integrated water balance model however the underlying descriptors are different even though the descriptor sub scenarios of welfare government agriculture and cultural awareness differ it leads to the same discharge results due to the domestic and agricultural demand input and therefore the future water availability this just leads to a difference in likelihood of the sub scenario but does not change that the demand of agriculture tends to remain constant that is why s8 is not included in the integrated balance model but shows that future water availability is dependent on different socio economic descriptors 3 3 integrated water balance model in the following we focus on current discharge 2005 2015 and future discharge 2040 2050 changes for the entire catchment condorcerro in the integrated water balance model in contrast to the results in section 3 1 discharge is a function of water supply and demand and hence represents water availability in the catchment from the comparison of the bau scenario in fig 4 we can see that the used gcms show a rather broad range of future changes for both rcp scenarios fig 5 shows the mean annual discharge for the different socio economic and climate scenarios separated by the five gcms on the one hand we compare the mean monthly discharge in m3 s and on the other hand the cumulative monthly discharge volume in km3 there is no common trend among the gcms based cordex model runs some of the underlying gcms show a large range of values others do not except for one model scenario ichec ec earth the cumulative volume of the gcms and scenarios for one year is above the current time and in the order of 4 6 km3 fig 5 the differences of the mean annual discharge between the gcms are rather large and in the order of around 50 m3 s difference the mean annual discharge of the gcms shows a general increase in discharge at condorcerro for the future scenarios ichec ec earth and miroc miroc5 indicate lower values for the rcp8 5 compared to the current discharge and rcp2 6 mpi m mpi esm lr ncc noresm1 m and mohc hadgem2 es on the other hand show an increase from the current levels while ncc noresm1 m and mohc hadgem2 es also show an increase from rcp2 6 to rcp8 5 whereas the other three scenarios show a decrease from rcp2 6 to rcp8 5 table 6 presents the results of the multi year mean of annual and seasonal discharge at condorcerro based on the 5 gcms and 5 socio economic scenarios for the period 2040 2050 including their change to the current discharge minimum and maximum values are shown for the multi year mean and for single years and seasons for the two rcps on average the gcms indicate increased annual discharge by 15 m3 s 11 in rcp2 6 and by 13 m3 s 9 in rcp8 5 compared to the current baseline 2005 2015 whereas mean dry season discharge decreases by 14 m3 s 33 rcp2 6 and by 15 m3 s 36 rcp8 5 respectively mean wet season discharge increases by 43 m3 s 18 and by 39 m3 s 17 respectively another space of possible future development is sketched by socio economic development and related scenarios interestingly compared to the hydro climatic projections the socio economic scenarios show a smaller range on variability of water availability as seen in fig 6 the four selected socio economic scenarios have similar impacts on total runoff within the individual climate scenario differences in descriptors shown in fig 6 are based on the four quantitative descriptors implemented in the modelling from table 5 urban population water infrastructure domestic demand and agricultural demand the bau scenario is not based on the socio economic scenarios than rather on the current trend and is generally related to the highest discharge nevertheless we expect the other socio economic scenarios to be more representative of future development as they show possible future pathways including socio economic factors such as increase or decrease of demand connected to a wholesome study of descriptors as the descriptors determine potential increasing unchanged or decreasing domestic and agricultural water use their tendencies have considerable influence on future water availability s12 and s23 behave very similar while s22 and s28 show a slightly different discharge compared to s12 and s23 figs 6 and 7 scenario s22 reports the highest water availability the large export oriented agriculture foster the improvement and expansion of water infrastructure with high efficiencies and limited losses even with immigration from other regions the improved water infrastructure linked with high cultural awareness and water prices that support infrastructure domestic water use remains low as a result the total water demand can still be supported by the reduced water supply the opposite would be true for s28 where the discharge is slightly lower due to the higher demand of agriculture as traditional small scale agriculture is inefficient due to high losses in infiltration caused by flooding from gravitational irrigation and poorly preserved channels agriculture demands almost 54 of total water demand ana 2015 and therefore is a controlling factor of water availability further the population has little to now environmental awareness e g to conserve water combined with weak organizations that implement water policies there are no fees for water usage the interests of the actors in the relevant sector industry energy agriculture etc guide water policy with no coordination and cooperation over water usage which results in conflicts over the use of water resources all of which result in a high domestic water demand s12 and s23 might have the same tendencies of the trajectory of domestic and agricultural water demand constant however if looked in more detail on the descriptors they are driven by differing socio economic developments as described the socio economic drivers of the five selected scenarios differ which results in the difference of water demand for domestic and agriculture and therefore in future water availability for a more detailed description of the tendencies of the descriptors see table 1 of the supplement the relative change for the future discharge 2040 2050 compared to current 2005 2015 levels shows that annual discharge as a function of water supply and demand based on the gcms and scenarios is generally increasing which is also true for the wet season discharge however the dry season discharge is decreasing substantially across all climatic and socio economic scenarios dry season discharge decreases by up to 60 s28 for condorcerro yet this has to be put in context as the dry season discharge is low due to very low precipitation input so relative changes are preponderate this implies that for a mean discharge of 20 m3 s this would result in 12 m3 s less water available in the percentage comparison we can also see the differences among the socio economic scenario being smaller than among the climate scenarios driven by the different gcms the annual differences of the socio economic scenarios are only in the order of a few percent from the lowest to the highest discharge however for the dry season discharge the differences among socio economic scenarios substantially increase by up to 30 for the same climate model indicating the high sensitivity of the dry season to socio economic change related water demand taking a closer look at inter catchment differences we separated the mostly glacier dominated la balsa from the greater condorcerro catchment the differences in discharge and water availability between the larger condorcerro catchment and la balsa are significant see figs 6 and 7 even though the total discharge volume and mean annual discharge is about half of that of condorcerro la balsa shows a different pattern the future scenarios show a decrease of total discharge below the current level also mean annual discharge for all gcms is decreasing below the current discharge the annual wet and dry season discharge decreases with the dry season discharge showing the largest changes relative change for s28 is between 75 and 96 negative difference in dry season discharge compared to the current level in order to eliminate the variability of the precipitation signals of the gcms we added a scenario that assumed precipitation to be unchanging precipitation patterns and volume for the future scenarios and only changed temperature according to the gcms this implies a higher relative importance of temperature dependent drivers of river runoff such as glacier melt or evapotranspiration our results see supplement fig 3 show that there would be no significant change for annual discharge for the condorcerro catchment however wet season discharge would slightly increase while the dry season discharge would decrease discharge for la balsa however shows a decrease in annual discharge due to the greater glaciated basin extent as well as a decrease in wet and dry season discharge decrease of dry season water availability is driven by a combination of diminishing glacier discharge and increasing water demand both of which adopt a major role in the absence of considerable precipitation inputs in this simulation however the signal of the socio economic scenarios is more pronounced with differences in decreases of up to 9 wet season and up to 20 dry season 4 discussion the objectives of our study were i to develop an interdisciplinary model framework for assessing future water supply and demand for the santa river catchment in peru which should ii represent a useful tool for the analysis of the different components determining water availability i e water supply and demand capable to support local water management and iii to determine future water availability in the santa river catchment to aid leveraging actions for adaptation in the water sector conceptually and in its simplest form a model framework for water supply and demand is straightforward a certain quantity of water needs to be extracted from the hydrological model at certain points in the catchment in practice and reality however things are much more complex the interactions between water supply and demand are dynamic over space and time for instance whether to what extent and over which time extracted water enters again runoff generating ground and surface water depends among other on the type of water use domestic agricultural industrial these processes are insufficiently measured and understood in particular for data scarce and poorly monitored regions in the developing world another major challenge is missing information and data on the amount and location of water demand and extraction furthermore a model framework that is able to assess future water supply and demand needs to rely on plausible scenarios for the future integrating both climatic and socio economic conditions for the next decades here we have put major efforts into collection and analysis of available data and co development of future socio economic scenarios with stakeholders our model results quantify the effect of different socio economic drivers and their tendencies for future water availability as we use different key variables such as governmental structures welfare water policies and cultural awareness in our cib analysis to develop our future projections our approach aligns with efforts of socio hydrology facilitating a more holistic perspective of water supply and demand carey et al 2017 wesselink et al 2017 the stakeholder workshop in 2018 allowed a validation of the initial results a key aspect in socio hydrological theory di baldassarre et al 2016 even more the workshop did not only identify possible future scenarios but also captured the expectations and perspectives of stakeholders and policymakers about feasible scenarios a main challenge thereby is the translation of qualitative data from approaches like ours to quantitative data that can be used as input to hydrological models important information such as related to welfare and inequality government or cultural awareness was not directly included in the model but represents explanatory factors for the changes in water demand although other approaches in socio hydrology like agent based modelling wens et al 2019 or multi agent network dermody et al 2018 cover feedbacks and other factors related to decision making the high diversity of stakeholders and cultural approaches on water management represent a limitation for large scale simulations of these models in the last years several studies have used a combination of the ssps shared socioeconomic pathways and rcps to comprehensively evaluate climatic and socioeconomic scenarios bijl et al 2016 mouratiadou et al 2016 wada et al 2016 however the ssps were developed without explicit assumptions for the water sector graham et al 2018 in addition the ssps work on a global or regional scale therefore their downscaling on catchment scale requests assumptions that incorporate additional uncertainties in this context consistency between climate and socio economic scenarios becomes relevant our socio economic scenarios include a climate change descriptor a1 a3 related to extremes flood drought which was an important aspect for the stakeholders during the workshop and represents a complementary aspect as compared to the climate scenarios which were analyzed for annual and seasonal changes but not short term extremes overall we think that our model framework combining a lumped hydrological model and the cib method for socio economic scenario development a in a region of societal diversity and scarce hydroclimatic data availability can be a viable option in similar regions the limited amount and quality of data available was in fact one of the major challenges to implement our model framework and put it in value for support of local water management considering that many regions in the world with similar current and future problems of water scarcity suffer from similar issues viviroli et al 2020 su et al 2022 we analyze this aspect here in more detail one of our major concerns regarding data scarcity is for example that observed discharge data contains gaps in the measurements and had to be infilled thus inevitably introducing some degree of error for the future we had to deal with uncertainties concerning timing and quantity of precipitation given by the underlying climate models for instance some of the scenarios in our integrated water balance model show a decrease of water availability from rcp2 6 to rcp8 5 while others indicate an increase large divergence of rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 mainly occurs post 2050 and therefore greater changes are expected under rcp8 5 until 2100 the variability of the hydro climatic signal is still rather high and does not show a common trend this is possibly due to the fact that rcms at cordex type resolution can still exhibit biases such as the underestimation of temperature at different altitudes of mountains and the overestimation of precipitation over mountain regions in association with unresolved topographic forcing which remains too smoothed over the complex terrain of the andes pabón caicedo et al 2020 gcms have very limited ability to adequately simulate precipitation variability and trends due to the distinct small scaled topographic features that are not adequately resolved because of the poor resolution of the gcms and the complex dynamic influence on local climate buytaert et al 2010 minvielle and garreaud 2011 vuille et al 2008 therefore higher resolution regional climate models coupled with glacier models are necessary to better project future climate changes and their impacts on tropical andean glaciers and associated runoff vuille et al 2008 while variability and uncertainty in precipitation projections for this region can currently hardly be substantially reduced the projections for temperature bear less uncertainty and translate directly into relatively robust glacier melt and loss water demand quantification is also affected by limited availability of data and across the different users domestic agriculture mining and industry this challenges the water supply and demand interaction as we cannot say with high precision how much water is being consumed more government and research efforts therefore should be directed to water demand measurements monitoring and analysis as the water demand is important for the local policy level to determine where actions can be taken in line with this for future research adaptation planning and policy initiatives we suggest strong capacity building and investments into hydro climatic and water demand monitoring including participatory approaches such as citizen science initiatives these have an increasing application potential in the region particularly to deal with high uncertainties by increasing spatio temporal data availability and reduce conflict potentials by including local communities and stakeholders into research and water management practices buytaert et al 2014 muñoz et al 2021 overall while this analysis to our knowledge represents the most comprehensive assessment available so far for the region there is a need for further development and evaluation of such methods many of these data limited regions have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to climate change due to human natural vulnerabilities such as sensitive ecosystems poor and marginalized people and livelihoods depending on local climate immerzeel et al 2020 mcdowell et al 2019 notwithstanding the data limitations our model framework and study is able to provide key information regarding current and future water availability and their controlling factors in order to support local water management and adaptation first our results show that the model simulates the observed seasonal cycle of river discharge reasonably well with increasing water availability at annual scale until 2050 for the condorcerro catchment where runoff is more rainfall dominated for the dry season however we observe a decline in water availability correlated with decreasing glacier discharge and an exacerbated seasonal hydrological cycle positive future precipitation trends as suggested in our study based on cordex data for the wet season are in line with other studies analyzing regional climate models for peru and the tropical andes region olsson et al 2017 urrutia and vuille 2009 van soesbergen and mulligan 2018 vera et al 2006 trends for the past decades 1983 2012 based on station data confirm increasing precipitation trends in the order of 60 mm decade for the cordillera blanca since the 1980 s schauwecker et al 2014 however as seen the topography of the andes poses a major challenge to precipitation projections and other studies reported decreasing precipitation trends for the 21st century chou et al 2014 neukom et al 2015 an important result is that climate change exerts a higher influence on future water availability than socio economic changes this result however is specific for the study catchment and cannot be generalized for other catchments in the andes or beyond as it is a result of the characteristic water supply and demand dynamics of the santa river area to gain further insights into the socio economic drivers we performed model simulations where we removed the precipitation change signal the scenarios then show a pronounced divergence and water availability and runoff are reduced by increasing domestic and especially agricultural water demand given the inconsistencies in agricultural water demand numbers we found as reported by different state agencies we ran model simulations with up to 3 mm day water demand corresponding to about 12 000 m3 ha year as an estimated upper bound value this results in future discharge volumes being significantly lower and below the current volumes the mean annual discharge would decrease then for simulations with 4 out of 5 gcms the dry season discharge would decrease by up to 80 for condorcerro and would be very sensitive to the increasing agricultural demand see supplement figs 4 and 5 for the la balsa catchment and the local water availability this could have severe consequences with half the water volume available and more severe dry season conditions overall hence all scenario combinations indicate a substantial decrease in water availability for the dry season and importantly show that the conditions in the dry season are very sensitive to either climatic or socio economic changes in the future juen et al 2007 motschmann et al 2020 the drivers of change are diverse and interdependent and hence there is no single driver of socio economic change water availability and scarcity but rather a combination of many water demand from agricultural or domestic use can be driven by factors such as governmental long term strategies and water policies or cultural awareness of the population we provided a list of key hydro climatic and socio economic drivers in the glacierized santa catchment and elaborated on future developments of these key drivers using a participatory scenario construction and validation method that integrates a diverse group of stakeholders including local water use and decision making aspects and scientific expert knowledge we expect those socio economic scenarios to cover a realistic image of future water availability this participatory approach allows for discussing socio economic scenarios with local actors and involves them within the research process this first effort to co produce integrated water resource scenarios identifying key drivers of change should be further used for the development of locally tailored and feasible adaptation strategies to meet the challenges of future water problems the conditions of the santa river are comparable to many other regions of the tropical andes with importance of glacial meltwater contribution for downstream water use e g buytaert et al 2017 and substantial changes in socio economic development such as in several high andean catchments of bolivia e g water availability for la paz soruco et al 2015 and ecuador e g water supply for quito pouget et al 2015 therefore our results suggest that efforts in integrated water resource management to avoid severe conditions of water scarcity need to be substantially increased in the region water governance plays a central role in the catchment but faces important challenges related to diverse interests and perceptions and power inequalities of and among actors and stakeholders drenkhan et al 2015 lynch 2012 in fact water allocation and water usage have been identified as the main factors driving water scarcity carey et al 2017 drenkhan et al 2015 mark et al 2017 paerregaard 2018 vuille et al 2018 water infrastructure requires important investments to reduce water losses in the future particularly during drought conditions and to counteract increases in water demand finally in consideration of the projected increasing imbalance between wet season and dry season water availability development of new water storage capacities could be a feasible option however additional water storage needs to be carefully planned to avoid further social conflicts and the fact that an over reliance on water infrastructure might increase human vulnerabilities and even lead to increased water shortage often referred to the reservoir effect di baldassarre et al 2018 recent studies have pointed to the potential synergies between water users and decision makers integrating water management flood disaster prevention and hydropower generation in overarching projects with important co benefits such water reservoirs require participatory planning and implementation as multi purpose infrastructure drenkhan et al 2019 haeberli et al 2016 haeberli and drenkhan 2022 5 conclusion in this study we present an approach of interdisciplinary water resource research combining hydro climatic modelling with socio economic scenarios to deal with the complexity of coupled human natural systems the model aims to develop integrative scenarios by exploring the uncertainty of future hydrological climatic social economic and political change in the highly glaciated santa river catchment by 2050 these drivers are then combined into consistent descriptions of possible future developments results show an increase of water availability at annual scale by 2050 consistent across several gcms and for both low rcp 2 6 and high rcp8 5 emission scenarios and for different socio economic scenarios the increase is mainly driven by higher precipitation inputs during the wet season in contrast dry season water availability is projected to substantially decrease by more than 50 mainly due to reduced glacier melt in combination with increasing water demand and an enhanced seasonal hydrological cycle at annual scale results suggest that the hydro climatic factors have a higher effect on water availability than socioeconomic factors in the study region yet this has to be put in context as low dry season discharge is controlled by very low precipitation inputs at annual scale the differences among the socio economic scenarios are mainly within a few percent of discharge value however for dry season discharge the differences among socio economic scenarios substantially increase by up to 30 within each climate model indicating high sensitivity to changing water demand during the dry season this underlines the importance of investments and improvement in water management and climate change adaptation to avoid seasonal periods of water scarcity in the future in data scarce regions such as the andes of peru limited quality and availability of data introduces additional uncertainty to model results and projections it is important to distinguish between data and model derived uncertainties on the one hand and the scenario related range of possible future outcomes on the other hand the range of projected water availability is a function of the different emission climate and socio economic scenarios uncertainties derive from missing or low quality measurements of climatic and hydrologic variables complex topography that climate models cannot adequately resolve and from unavailable or inconsistent water use data based on our model results we suggest strong capacity building and investments into hydro climatic and water demand monitoring which should include more participatory approaches such as citizen science initiatives the projected reinforcement in seasonal water availability found in this study highlights the need to adequately consider spatio temporal scales within multi scenario water balance models to support local decision making our results elucidate the urgent need for improvements in water infrastructure and related efficiencies future water storage planning and implementation should consider an integrated inclusive and participatory process where synergies can be generated between water reservoir management disaster risk reduction and energy production this is likely a robust finding and claim not only for our study region in the andes of peru

7951,study region north eastern tasmania australia study focus two quantitative methods for determining the bankfull stage of alluvial rivers from plotted channel cross sections were assessed bankfull stage estimates determined using the minimum width to depth ratio and the first maximum of the bench index were compared and then evaluated against qualitative estimates of bankfull stage using data from 89 cross sectional surveys along nine alluvial river reaches in north eastern tasmania new hydrological insights for the region the minimum width to depth ratio was found to provide lower estimates of bankfull stage than the bench index with an overall mean ratio between the two methods of 0 84 qualitative estimates of bankfull stage generally fell between those provided by the two models with the minimum width to depth ratio performing better when assessed against qualitative estimates these results show that while neither method provides a suitable stand alone means for estimating bankfull stage in combination they provide an effective means to approximate the range of bankfull stage the high variability in bankfull stage found along a reach in this study indicates that where possible bankfull stage is best determined at the reach rather than single cross sectional scale bankfull stage should be presented as a range of values with associated confidence intervals rather than as a finite result with definition of bankfull stage estimates and sample number also reported keywords river channel cross section river reach bankfull stage tasmania australia 1 introduction bankfull is a fundamental concept in fluvial geomorphology with significant applications in relation to hydrological and ecological processes knighton 1998 wohl 2010 navratil et al 2010 lindroth et al 2020 it is also an important parameter in river rehabilitation habitat creation and river management projects he and wilkerson 2011 tedford and ellison 2018 the elevation or depth at which bankfull occurs known as the bankfull stage is a widely used measure of river flow and it is commonly applied in three ways firstly bankfull stage marks the point above which the river channel becomes connected with the floodplain when discharge exceeds bankfull stage biotic and abiotic elements including aquatic organisms vegetation sediment and nutrients are transferred and redistributed bouwman et al 2013 consequently the frequency and extent with which flow exceeds the channel has important ecological and geomorphological consequences and is also of importance to infrastructure design flood mapping and insurance risk dutta et al 2003 richards 2004 secondly the discharge which occurs at bankfull stage is linked to channel formation in a highly influential work wolman and miller 1960 showed that while discharge events of varying magnitude frequency and temporal structure influence channel form the channel morphology of alluvial rivers appears to be associated with flows at or near the bankfull stage the relationship between channel shape and bankfull discharge has since been widely debated particularly in australia pickup and warner 1976 australian rivers have important differences to those in other continents having more variable flow regimes finlayson and mcmahon 1988 additionally they have sediment loads dominated by fine suspended particles and with reduced coarse sediment load relative to other continents because of tectonic stability and the almost complete absence of quaternary glaciations tooth and nanson 1995 however concepts of a channel forming discharge to which the channel geometry becomes adjusted continue to be central to fluvial geomorphology studies doyle et al 2007 monegaglia and tubino 2019 the third common bankfull stage application is its use as a reference level which can reasonably be defined amongst the complexity of river morphology knighton 1998 in this role bankfull is widely used to compare spatial and temporal variations in river metrics powell et al 2006 buraas et al 2014 lindroth et al 2020 bankfull parameters such as bankfull stage bankfull width and bankfull discharge are extensively used in hydrological and geomorphic studies as well as in river channel classification rosgen 1994 kasprak et al 2016 river health assessment systems ausrivas 2020 and applications in remote sensing of river discharge bjerklie 2007 bjerklie et al 2018 1 1 definitions of bankfull stage the variety of bankfull stage applications have led to several definitions williams 1978 radecki pawlik 2002 which can give conflicting results he 2019 in some studies bankfull stage has been defined in a theoretical sense attained when water reaches a point not necessarily associated with the physical top of the banks stream systems technology center 1993 these theoretical definitions commonly equate bankfull stage with an abstract discharge such as bankfull stage corresponds to the discharge at which channel maintenance is the most effective dunne and leopold 1978 or relate it to the recurrence frequency of a flood event such as the stage occupied by the 1 58 year flood on the annual series dury et al 1963 pickup 1976 in contrast to the theoretical definitions a range of physical definitions of bankfull stage have been made based on recognition of sedimentary surfaces observation or measurement of boundary features or geometrical properties williams 1978 malik and pal 2020 among many of these physical definitions differences exist on the particular stage at which bankfull occurs definitions range from the stage at which discharge just fills the river channel without overflowing onto the floodplain williams 1978 gordon et al 2004 gomez et al 2007 the stage at which discharge just overflows the banks of the channel onto the floodplain page 1988 or the elevation of the active floodplain wolman and leopold 1957 wolman and miller 1960 fig 1 although the differences in elevation between these various definitions may be small at the point of bankfull minor increases in depth are often accompanied by large increases in width and a slight difference in interpreting bankfull stage elevation can lead to significantly different values in other bankfull parameters leopold et al 1964 wilkerson 2008 a comparison of bankfull methods on 16 river reaches across france found morphological definitions more relevant and a combination of methods best used navratil et al 2006 1 2 determination of bankfull stage using qualitative methods the most frequently used method to determine bankfull stage is based on qualitative field observations of evidence such as scour lines vegetation limits changes between bed and banks material abrupt changes in slope or most commonly the active floodplain however floodplains are not always present they may be difficult to identify and they may not relate to the current river form for example in eastern australia many rivers show a channel geometry and planform fundamentally altered from natural conditions with many apparent floodplains flooded relatively infrequently and not in adjustment with the present river regime iea 1987 brierley et al 1999 fryirs et al 2018 incised rivers in both queensland dury et al 1963 and new south wales woodyer 1968 show an active floodplain which is rather a bench contained within the channel while the apparent floodplain is in fact a terrace additionally within a river several benches may be present woodyer 1968 and bankfull stage may not always be associated with the same bench along a river reach radecki pawlik 2002 bankfull stage can be particularly difficult to identify in unstable rivers simon et al 2004 where there has been channel disconnection from the floodplain brierley et al 1999 fryirs et al 2018 or where the river is adjusting to a new equilibrium despite many detailed definitions of bankfull stage being developed in recognition of the difficulty in identifying the active floodplain gippel 1985 page 1988 de rose et al 2008 harman et al 2008 identifying bankfull stage in the field continues to rely on subjective judgment and may result in inconsistent estimates if observers do not have sufficient training or experience rosgen 2009 1 3 determination of bankfull stage using quantitative methods methods to develop more objective and repeatable methods for determining bankfull stage arose as fluvial geomorphology moved from qualitative to more quantitative techniques quantitative methods for determining bankfull stage offer considerable benefits over qualitative methods they do not rely on the presence of an active floodplain or other often subjective field evidence and they enable bankfull stage to be determined without field observations or expert assessment this allows the use of remotely sensed data or other data collected for purposes other than identifying bankfull stage in addition quantitative techniques generally use fewer resources than field based methods and are more objective williams 1978 however some studies have found that quantitative methods inadequately define bankfull stage riley 1972 gregory 1976 they do not provide significantly greater accuracy then visual field inspection williams 1978 or they are less relevant than morphological definitions navratil et al 2006 the two most commonly used quantitative methods are the minimum width to depth ratio and the first maximum of the bench index radecki pawlik 2002 finnegan et al 2005 simon and darby 1997 navratil et al 2006 yanites et al 2010 he 2019 conesa garcía et al 2020 few studies have previously directly compared the methods using a large regional dataset 1 3 1 width to depth ratio the ratio of the channel width w to mean channel depth d fig 2 has been extensively used as a measure of channel shape fig 1 and is determined according to eq 1 1 r wd w d the use of the width to depth ratio to determine bankfull stage is attributed to wolman 1955 defining bankfull as that stage at a given cross section at which in a plot of the width to depth ratio against stage the curve breaks sharply and the width becomes exceedingly large fig 2 however rather than associate this stage with the physical top of the channel banks wolman found that above this point the channel begins to flare out and depart from the more rectangular shape prevailing below this stage wolman 1955 this point may correspond with the bank inflection point fig 1 which corresponds to the main change in bank slope or the end of the abrupt part of the bank navratil et al 2006 several subsequent works have departed from wolman s methods and associated a top of bank bankfull with the stage at which the width to depth ratio is at a minimum harvey 1969 riley 1972 pickup and warner 1976 pickup 1976 johnson and heil 1996 copeland et al 2000 gordon et al 2004 gomez et al 2007 despite several studies showing that the minimum width to depth ratio generally underestimates bankfull stage riley 1972 williams 1978 navratil et al 2004 2006 this method continues to be used for determining bankfull stage from channel geometries conesa garcía et al 2020 lindroth et al 2020 1 3 2 bench index to develop a method for identifying bankfull stage that was less dependent on subjective judgment and more amenable to computer operations riley 1972 defined a bench index bi as 2 bi w i w i 1 d i d i 1 where i 1 2 3 x and x is the number of unique width and depth measurements available ranked in ascending value i e the greater the value of i the closer to the channel bed fig 2 the bench index measures the relative slope of a segment of channel profile with high values indicating relatively horizontal channel segments and low values defining relatively vertical segments riley 1972 fig 2 based on the results from 20 river sites in north western new south wales with a wide range of cross sectional areas and profile shapes riley found that when plotted against depth the bench index showed a marked peaked value near the bankfull stage indicating that bankfull stage was equivalent to the first maximum of the bench index when measured in descending elevations decreasing depth however several subsequent studies have found that the first maximum of the bi significantly overestimated bankfull stage on some reaches williams 1978 radecki pawlik 2002 navratil et al 2004 2006 from 7 cross sections across two polish rivers radecki pawlik 2002 rather found riley s bench index the more useful of several bankful parameters which is best defined as a discharge which appears within a certain range of discharges 1 4 aims this study uses data from 89 cross sectional surveys undertaken at nine river reaches in different catchments in north eastern tasmanian rivers a part of the world that is lesser known to the fluvial research community to compare the minimum width to depth ratio and the first maximum of the bench index against qualitative estimates of bankfull stage the study aims are to 1 evaluate two quantitative methods for determining bankfull stage from plotted cross sections 2 provide guidance on the determination and reporting of bankfull stage 2 methodology 2 1 environmental context the fluvial geomorphology of the rivers of tasmania a continental island located 41 43os has significant differences from those of mainland australia to the north the highly variable tasmanian landscape includes areas which have experienced relatively recent tectonic activity and glaciation sharples 1996 which combined with the large variations in hydrology and lithology has resulted in a wide variety of channel and floodplain forms across tasmanian catchments jerie et al 2003 north eastern tasmania is a region geologically and geomorphologically distinct sharples 1996 its marine turbidite rocks were initially deposited at some distance from the rest of tasmania then tectonically transported to their present position much of the region was subsequently uplifted with thin sequences of permian sedimentary rock then being deposited in the present highland areas before being intruded by extensive sheets of dolerite magma during the mid jurassic a temperate marine climate drives the dominant fluvial processes with occasional intense and sustained rainfall events which can cause major flooding in the north east keast and ellison 2013 despite some anthropogenic impacts including alluvial mining forestry agriculture and irrigation ellison et al 2019 and in contrast to much of south eastern australia the majority of rivers in north eastern tasmania remain largely unmodified and unregulated the nine study reaches were located on eight rivers across six catchments in north eastern tasmania fig 3 table 1 ranging in size from third river at paling track a first order river with an upstream catchment area of just 4 4 km2 to the south esk river at ormley a sixth order river with a catchment area of over 1360 km2 sites were either in unconfined or partially confined valley settings all sites were set in unconsolidated sediments with a river channel largely free to adjust to discharge this can be evidenced in the meandering planform of rivers fig 3 table 1 2 2 data channel cross sectional survey data for eight of the nine river reaches table 1 were obtained from the tasmanian department of primary industries parks water and environment dpipwe these survey data were collected for a variety of purposes including the establishment of environmental flow levels for each reach 5 12 cross sections were surveyed spaced 15 40 m apart surveys were undertaken using leica levels which provide depth accuracy estimated to be within 0 01 m and horizontal accuracy to be within 0 1 m the number of cross sections and their separation was generally based on the complexity of the physical form of the river channel as recommended by edwards et al 2019 more cross sections were undertaken on more variable channels to minimize error in bankfull stage parameter estimation harman et al 2008 rather than using prescriptive measures to identify site location and the number and location of cross sectional surveys place based understanding brierley et al 2013 was adopted where contextual considerations are used to detect important local differences allowing transferability of insights between locations and representative sample sites brierley et al 2013 third river at paling track table 1 for example was a relatively small upper catchment river with a simple channel that displayed little variability in channel morphology along the reach based on the relatively homogenous channel morphology 5 cross sectional surveys were considered sufficient to capture reach morphological variability additional cross sectional survey data collected from some sites were later excluded from the study due to the presence of bedrock outcrops or an anabranching channel making bankfull channel impossible to identify cross sections targeted a range of channel forms pool riffle run where they existed and included a range of channel types from simple channels to complex channels with features including in channel benches overbank terraces and flood chutes cross sectional surveys extended from above obvious bankfull flow levels on one bank to a similar elevation on the opposite river bank but focused on the proportion of the channel at and below the bankfull flow thresholds therefore at most sites surveying of the extended floodplain if present was not undertaken dpipwe 2010 all sites were surveyed at low flow conditions the software package win xspro grant et al 1992 was used to plot each cross section and to model cross sectional channel parameters at 0 01 m increments in stage from the deepest point of the channel to well above the maximum elevation of the lowest channel bank of the survey plots were modified in some instances by removing features such as flood chutes to ensure that only a single channel was considered at each increment all statistical analyses were undertaken using the software package r 2 3 minimum width to depth ratio wd the ratio of channel width to depth was calculated at 0 01 m stage increments for each cross section by dividing the channel width w by the mean depth d eq 1 following common practice this study defined mean depth as cross sectional area a divided by width w bankfull using the wd method was defined as the stage at which the minimum of the width to depth ratio occurred a lower limit of 50 of the maximum elevation of the lowest channel bank was set to eliminate low width to depth values which occurred at very low stages due to irregularities on the channel bed 2 4 first maximum of the bench index bi bankfull stage using the bench index was determined largely according to the methods of riley 1972 however as channel parameters were modelled at equal increments 0 01 m d i d i 1 remains constant and may be removed from eq 2 to produce 3 bench index bi w i w i 1 where i 1 2 3 x and x is the number of unique width and depth measurements available ranked in ascending value i e the greater the value of i the closer to the channel bed following riley 1972 the stage that corresponded with the first maximum of the bench index from upper the maximum elevation of the lowest channel bank to lower elevation was bankfull stage neither riley nor subsequent studies explained the method used to identify the maximum and in this study maxima were identified using a simple algorithm if bi i 1 bi i let bi i bi i 1 if bi i 1 bi i go to bi i 2 continue to repeat through to i 5 if bi i 5 bi i then bi i is equivalent to bankfull stage if bi i 1 bi i then bi i is equivalent to bankfull stage where consecutive increments had equivalent values the upper increment was determined to be equivalent to bankfull stage as this was thought to be more in line with the methods of riley 1972 2 5 qualitative estimates of bankfull stage this study adopted the physical definition of bankfull used by riley 1972 as the stage above which flow would exceed the active channel banks this was chosen as it provided the most objective and consistent definition for quantitative comparisons definitions based on floodplain elevation were rejected as being often subjective and because floodplains were not always present ideally bankfull stage models should be compared with the true bankfull stage however the chances of being present to measure bankfull parameters just at bankfull are extremely small williams 1978 and consequently bankfull stage values can only ever be an estimate in this study bankfull stage was estimated at each cross section by interpretation of plotted channel profiles with particular attention paid to channel morphological features which could be observed across several cross sections along a reach field observations and notes were used to assist this process where available a 3d multiple cross section plot was also created in some instances to ensure that the estimated bankfull elevation at each cross section was consistent along a reach 2 6 model evaluation this study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the performance of the two quantitative bankfull stage models it first compares the ratio between bankfull stage estimates derived using the minimum width to depth ratio wd and those determined using the first maxima of the bench index bi and conducts paired t tests to consider the differences between the two methods in comparison to the overall and within a reach variability this study also evaluates estimates of bankfull stage from the two quantitative bankfull stage models against qualitative estimates of bankfull stage using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr the combination of these three measures provides a comprehensive and relevant model assessment method moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a dimensionless statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance in comparison to the measured data variance moriasi et al 2007 nse is calculated using eq 4 4 nse 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y i mean 2 where y i obs is the ith observation for the constituent being evaluated y i s im is the ith simulated value for the constituent being evaluated y mean is the mean of observed data for the constituent being evaluated and n is the total number of observations moriasi et al 2007 nse values range between and 1 0 with nse 1 being the optimal value and values between 0 0 and 1 0 generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance values 0 0 indicate that the residual variance is larger than the data variance which indicates unacceptable performance moriasi et al 2007 to assist in identifying true outliers and assessing the relevance of calculated nse values z scores which are commonly used to provide a standardized measure of the distance of an observation from the mean were also determined for each qualitative estimate of bankfull stage bf using sample mean and standard deviation percent bias pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observed data and can indicate poor model performance gupta et al 1999 pbias is determined using eq 5 5 pbias i 1 n y i obs y i sim 100 i 1 n y i obs where pbias is the deviation of data being evaluated expressed as a percentage the optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values indicate model underestimation bias and negative values indicate model overestimation bias gupta et al 1999 the root mean square error rmse to the standard deviation of the measured data rsr is calculated by eq 6 6 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 rsr incorporates the commonly used error index statistic rmse with a scaling normalization factor that is based on the standard deviation of the observations rsr varies from the optimal value of 0 which indicates zero rmse or residual variation and therefore perfect model simulation to a large positive value the lower the rsr the lower the rmse and the better the model simulation performance moriasi et al 2007 bankfull stage model estimates were judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 following general model evaluation standards moriasi et al 2007 performance ratings for pbias depend on the application and in this study were set at 15 the results are also presented graphically as a plot of mean reach bankfull stage values with associated 95 confidence intervals ci non parametric confidence intervals were constructed using a bootstrap resampling method in r canty and ripley 2014 with 2000 iterations diciccio and efron 1996 3 results the mean ratios between bankfull stage values determined using the minimum width to depth ratio wd and those determined using the first maxima of the bench index bi for each reach as well as for the combined 89 individual cross sections along with the results of the paired t tests are shown in table 2 the results of bankfull stage model evaluation against qualitative estimates using nse rsr and pbias are shown in table 3 along with co efficient of variation cv values and graphs of reach averaged bankfull stage parameters and 95 confidence intervals calculated from bootstrapped samples for estimated and model derived bankfull stage are shown in fig 4 the mean ratio between wd and bi derived estimates across all 89 individual cross sections was 0 84 with a range of 0 56 0 96 for mean reach ratios between wd and bi derived estimates there was a significant overall difference between wd and bi derived estimates of bankfull stage t 10 35 df 88 p 0 0000 for the combined eighty nine cross sections and for seven of the nine reaches no significant difference for site 3 and site 7 table 2 bankfull stage values determined using the wd method were generally less than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage bf with an overall pbias value of 6 59 across all 89 cross sections and positive pbias values underestimation on eight of the nine reaches ranging from 1 22 to 29 50 table 3 pbias values fell below 15 on eight of the nine reaches nse values ranged from 1 97 to 0 96 with four reaches having nse values less than or equal to 0 50 rsr values ranged from 0 20 to 1 72 with four reaches having values greater than or equal to 0 70 four of the nine reaches fell outside satisfactory model performance based on the evaluation of moriasi et al 2007 the wd derived mean reach bankfull stage fell within the 95 confidence intervals for bf on all reaches apart from sites 6 and 8 and the 95 confidence intervals for wd derived mean reach bankfull stage overlapped the 95 confidence intervals for bf on all reaches apart from site 6 fig 4 bankfull stage values determined using the bi method were generally greater than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage bf with an overall pbias value of 9 55 across all 89 cross sections and negative pbias values overestimation on all nine reaches ranging from 0 58 to 56 84 table 3 pbias values were less than 15 from bf values on four of the nine reaches nse values ranged from 2 52 0 97 with six reaches having nse values less than or equal to 0 50 rsr values ranged from 0 16 to 1 88 with six reaches having values greater than or equal to 0 70 six of the nine reaches fell outside satisfactory model performance moriasi et al 2007 the bi derived mean reach bankfull stage fell within the 95 ci for bf on all reaches apart from site 1 fig 4 several reaches had individual bf values which may be considered outliers with five of the eighty nine cross sections having z scores exceeding 1 75 however there was not a strong correlation between reaches with bf outliers and those which had low nse values for either bi or wd the range of values between the upper and lower 95 ci of bf was fully contained between the upper 95 ci of bi and the lower 95 ci of wd for each site the co efficient of variation cv for qualitative estimates of bankfull stage bf along a reach ranged from 0 06 to 0 44 table 3 while the cv for the minimum width to depth ratio wd ranged from 0 09 to 0 41 and the cv for first maxima of the bench index estimates of bankfull stage bi along a reach ranged from 0 05 to 0 30 table 3 there was similarity in the patterns of cv variability between sites for wd bi and bf variation between bankfull stage bf width to depth ratio wd and bench index bi bankfull stage values for individual cross sections along three example reaches third river at paling track site 1 the nile river at nile site 5 and isis the river at isis site 6 are shown in figs 5 7 and 9 respectively channel profiles for selected cross sections from each of the three examples are shown in figs 6 8 and 10 bankfull estimates at third river at paling track fig 5 varied both between methods and along the reach there was also considerable variation in the way the three estimates differed between cross sections at cross section 1 the wd estimate was close to the bf estimate both of which were below bf mean reach bankfull stage with the bi estimate well above these fig 5 the river at this cross section had a sloping channel bank on one side and a relatively vertical bank on the other side with rounded top of channel banks and a poorly defined floodplain fig 6 cross section 4 of third river at paling track had quite closely clustered bf wd and bi estimates fig 5 and the river channel at this cross section had more vertical banks breaking to a horizontal section of floodplain on one side fig 6 nile river at nile had relatively low variability in estimates of bankfull stage from cross section 1 to 8 but cross sections 9 12 showed a strong rise and fall in bankfull stage fig 7 cross section 3 of nile river at nile had a bi estimate equal to the bf estimate with the wd estimate well below these and outside the 95 ci of mean reach bf the river at this cross section had slightly sloping channel banks and rounded top of channel banks fig 8 cross section 8 of nile river at nile had both wd and bi estimates equal to bf estimates fig 7 the channel at this cross section had a clearly defined break between river channel and floodplain with the floodplain angling downwards away from the top of channel fig 8 cross section 11 of the nile river at nile had wd estimates similar to bf estimates with bi estimates well above both fig 7 the river channel at this location had a well defined break between channel and floodplain but the floodplain angled upwards away from the channel fig 8 there were no strong trends in bankfull estimates along the reach at the isis river at isis fig 9 cross section 2 from the isis river at isis had large differences between bf wd and bi estimates the channel at this location had sloping banks and a floodplain that sloped upwards away from the river channel fig 10 the river channel at cross section 8 had a very different shape with more vertical banks and a well defined horizontal section of floodplain between the main channel and a flood chute fig 10 and had closely clustered bf wd and bi estimates fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 minimum width to depth ratio wd results showed that the minimum width to depth ratio provided smaller mean reach estimates of bankfull stage than the bench index on all study reaches with significantly smaller estimates occurring on seven of the nine reaches table 2 minimum width to depth ratio estimates were rated as unsatisfactory for four of the nine reaches when assessed against qualitative estimates being generally smaller than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage table 3 these results support the outcomes of previous studies which have found that the minimum width to depth ratio often underestimates bankfull stage riley 1972 williams 1978 navratil et al 2004 2006 results showed that the wd performed better on channel cross sections with rectangular channel profiles for example it identified a mean reach bankfull stage almost identical to that of qualitative estimates at site 7 ringarooma river at the wetlands with a largely rectangular channel profile but performed poorly against qualitative estimates at site 6 isis river at isis with a complex channel with benches on several cross sections and a large flood chute across the floodplain riley 1972 found the minimum width to depth ratio to be dependent on channel shape close to the actual bankfull stage for channels with rectangular profiles but nearer the channel bed for channels with shallow profiles and gently sloping banks the minimum width to depth ratio identifies the point above which the channel begins to flare out and depart from the more rectangular shape below wolman 1955 and comparisons of width to depth plots with channel profiles from many of the cross sections in this study supported this view fig 11 4 2 first maximum of the bench index bi the bi method provided larger mean reach estimates of bankfull stage than the minimum width to depth ratio on all study reaches with a significant difference occurring on seven of the nine reaches table 2 the bi method performed less well against qualitative estimates than the wd method overall with only three of the nine reaches rated satisfactory however on the reaches where the performance of the bi method was satisfactory nse rsr and pbias values were better than those of the wd method the bi method provided bankfull stage values much higher than the estimated bankfull stage on some reaches with pbias values ranging up to 56 84 table 3 these results support those of previous studies which have found that the first maximum of the bench index significantly overestimated bankfull stage on some reaches williams 1978 radecki pawlik 2002 navratil et al 2004 2006 the bi method generally performed poorly where the channel had a sloping bank on one or both sides of the river channel breaking into a sloping floodplain and best where the channel banks were more perpendicular and the floodplain more horizontal figs 5 10 the results from this study highlight areas where the bench index method may be improved meeting the suggestions of williams 1978 firstly a maximum of the bi other than the first often occurred at a stage equivalent to qualitative estimates of bankfull stage fig 11 the location of the first maximum of the bench index is dependent on the upper limit of the cross sectional profile to which it is applied riley 1972 and in this study where plotted channel profiles extended well above the bankfull channel the first maximum often occurred at a stage well above the qualitative estimate of bankfull several studies have also found that the first maxima corresponded with an elevation above bankfull navratil et al 2004 and that maxima other than the first are equivalent to bankfull stage radecki pawlik 2002 navratil et al 2006 this supports findings of riley 1972 that subjective judgment is still required to define the traverse limits around the approximate bankfull channel to ensure the correct bench index maxima is identified secondly bench index maxima often occurred at an increment above qualitative estimates of bankfull stage e g table 4 maxima of the bench index occur where there are large increases in width relative to increase in stage riley 1972 and many cross sections in this study showed large increases in width just above the top of the channel bank fig 11 resulting in a large peak in the bench index as bankfull is defined as the stage above which the flow exceeds the active channel banks riley 1972 the increment prior at a lower elevation to a maximum of the bench index was often equivalent to the best estimate of bankfull stage differences in elevation between these two stages were small 0 01 m but near bankfull small increases in stage can result in large increases in other parameters gordon et al 2004 wilkerson 2008 in this study a single 0 01 m increment in stage resulted in an increase in channel width of more than 3 m for some sites a channel cross section from the nile river at nile for example showed a qualitative estimate of bankfull stage of 2 65 m with a width of 22 91 m while the bi estimate of bankfull stage was 2 67 m with a width of 27 54 fig 12 table 4 an increase in stage of just 0 02 m resulting in a difference of 4 63 m in bankfull width estimated bankfull stage for this cross section using wd was 2 68 m with a width of 27 65 m these results reflect the geometry of the channel at this location where discharge at around bankfull levels resulted in the channel becoming connected with the floodplain via a floodchute fig 12 4 3 reach variability results showed no clear relationship between the success or failure of wd or bi estimates and observed reach variability table 3 the similarity in the patterns of coefficient of variation cv variability between sites table 3 for each of the three methods indicate that the variability in bankfull stage is due to natural variability rather than model error or bias while the high individual cv values for all estimates of bankfull stage along a reach wd bi and bf table 3 strongly support the view radecki pawlik 2002 that bankfull stage should be defined as a range of values rather than as a single number related strictly to the geometry of a particular cross section to investigate the potential influence of landscape setting on bankfull stage estimation and bankfull stage variability further three sites were examined in more detail third river at paling track site 1 is partially confined table 1 set in a landscape of moderately steep hills ridges and spurs with flat alluvial valleys in many reaches the channel is trapezoidal in shape fig 6 and showed the highest cv for bf estimates along a reach for all sites table 3 and fig 5 the wd method was assessed to have performed satisfactorily on this reach while bi performance was assessed as unsatisfactory table 3 bi generally performed poorly on those cross sections which had sloping channel banks and best where the channel banks were more vertical figs 5 and 6 nile river at nile site 5 has a trapezoidal channel morphology fig 8 and is located on an unconfined reach set in a low relief landscape table 1 composed of broad valleys on tertiary sediment the site has poor riparian vegetation the reach experiences reasonably high stream power values with a slope of 0 005 m m it had a low cv along a reach for all three methods of estimating bankfull stage but significant differences existed between mean reach estimates of wd and bi table 3 and fig 7 wd estimates performed satisfactory against bf estimates but bi fell outside satisfactory model performances isis river at isis site 6 is a narrow channel fig 10 of an unconfined reach set in a low relief landscape table 1 composed of broad valleys on tertiary sediments there is little riparian vegetation along the channel banks and stock have unrestricted access to the river the channel along this reach is highly variable and quite complex with a well developed flood chute or smaller secondary channel present in some parts stream power is relatively small at this reach due to the low slope it showed quite a high cv for bf and both wd and bi model performances were outside satisfactory model performances table 3 and fig 9 these case studies illustrate the high variability in a range of hydrological and morphological parameters within a region and indicate that variability in bankfull stage along a reach is not necessarily associated with river type sites with partially confined river types included the two sites with the highest variability in reach bankfull stage and the two sites with the lowest variability tables 1 and 3 4 4 defining and reporting bankfull stage 4 4 1 defining bankfull stage the results of this study provide two contributions to the definition of bankfull stage first high variability in bankfull stage estimates found along a reach support that an individual cross section is insufficient to define bankfull stage bankfull stage should be reported as a mean reach value using cross sections based on contextual considerations of place based understanding brierley et al 2013 second results found that small increments in stage can bring about significant variability in process responses such as within channel and channel floodplain linkages at bankfull level a very small increment in stage can result in significant differences in the width of the water surface as discharge in the main channel becomes connected with the floodplain due to the natural variability in channel morphology the river channel generally becomes connected with the floodplain via smaller flood chutes along the reach while discharge is still constrained within the banks at other points on the same reach the high variability in bankfull parameters as discharge approaches bankfull stage is illustrated in the north esk river site fig 13 prior to bankfull stage discharge is fully constrained within the river channel banks as discharge nears bankfull stage discharge overflows the banks at lower points along the reach flowing into flood chutes which direct discharge onto the floodplain and create a wide water surface however even after the flood chutes have substantial flow the reach channel banks constrain the discharge to the main channel at many points 4 4 2 reporting bankfull stage results from this study show that bankfull stage is best reported as a mean reach value as values determined from a single cross section are misleading bankfull stage should be defined using an expected range with a measure of the level of confidence that the result falls within the actual value of population mean confidence intervals consider the sample size as well as the variability standard deviation of the sample it is therefore recommended that estimates of mean bankfull stage are reported with confidence intervals generally 95 as well as the number of observations used it is also recommended to follow navratil 2006 that the bankfull definitions used should be specified in detail when reporting bankfull stage estimates as an example of this reporting method the estimated mean reach bankfull stage for the nile river at nile using the definition of riley 1972 is 2 54 m n 12 95 ci 2 30 2 77 however it should be noted that confidence intervals only communicate uncertainty associated with sampling error and cannot describe or control non sampling error walshe et al 2007 any method not using complex statistical techniques will necessarily include uncertainty based on sample representativeness observer or method error and measurement error tayfur and singh 2011 5 conclusions the two most frequently used quantitative methods for determining bankfull stage were evaluated on 89 channel cross sections on eight rivers in north eastern tasmania across a range of channel sizes and cross sectional shapes these evaluation measures demonstrated that neither the minimum width to depth ratio nor the first maximum of the bench index provided a satisfactory accurate objective and repeatable method to determine bankfull stage from plotted channel geometries across all study reaches the minimum width to depth ratio provided lower mean reach values of bankfull stage than the first maximum of the bench index for all sites and generally provided lower values than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage but was the best performed of the two models overall when assessed against qualitative estimates this study supports previous understanding that the minimum width to depth ratio approximates to the stage above which increases in width becomes more rapid than increases in mean depth harvey 1969 rather than identifying bankfull stage consequently the performance of this method is dependent on channel shape the first maximum of the bench index provided larger values than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage on all reaches and performed less well when compared against qualitative estimates than the minimum width to depth ratio it performed best when channel banks were relatively perpendicular and there was a sudden transition to a horizontal floodplain the accuracy of the bench index method may be significantly improved by either limiting the range of analysis to the approximate bankfull stage or considering a maximum other than the first and by equating bankfull stage with the increment below maxima of the bench index while these results support views that there is no precise analytical method for determining bankfull value radecki pawlik 2002 they also show that these two methods provide a useful adjunct in the subjective determination of bankfull stage as the true value generally lies between the values provided by these two methods whilst the best method for the determination of bankfull stage at any particular location is dependent on a wide range of factors including objectives available resources type of waterway and setting based on the results from this study a number of recommendations are made 1 bankfull stage should be considered at the reach rather than cross sectional scale this is supported by the high variability in bankfull stage estimates along a reach found in the study 2 the determination of bankfull stage should incorporate multiple lines of evidence where possible as the true bankfull stage value generally lies between the minimum width to depth ratio and the first maxima of the bench index the use of these two methods can provide a useful check for estimates determined from field observations hydrological models or other methods 3 bankfull stage should be presented as a range of values with associated confidence intervals rather than as a finite result the number of samples and the definition of bankfull stage estimates should also be reported as an example the estimated mean reach bankfull stage using the definition of riley 1972 for the nile river at nile using field based observations in conjunction with plotted channel geometries is 2 54 m n 12 95 ci 2 30 2 77 4 where a single automated method for estimating bankfull stage from plotted channel geometries or digital terrain models is required the minimum width to depth ratio provides

7951,study region north eastern tasmania australia study focus two quantitative methods for determining the bankfull stage of alluvial rivers from plotted channel cross sections were assessed bankfull stage estimates determined using the minimum width to depth ratio and the first maximum of the bench index were compared and then evaluated against qualitative estimates of bankfull stage using data from 89 cross sectional surveys along nine alluvial river reaches in north eastern tasmania new hydrological insights for the region the minimum width to depth ratio was found to provide lower estimates of bankfull stage than the bench index with an overall mean ratio between the two methods of 0 84 qualitative estimates of bankfull stage generally fell between those provided by the two models with the minimum width to depth ratio performing better when assessed against qualitative estimates these results show that while neither method provides a suitable stand alone means for estimating bankfull stage in combination they provide an effective means to approximate the range of bankfull stage the high variability in bankfull stage found along a reach in this study indicates that where possible bankfull stage is best determined at the reach rather than single cross sectional scale bankfull stage should be presented as a range of values with associated confidence intervals rather than as a finite result with definition of bankfull stage estimates and sample number also reported keywords river channel cross section river reach bankfull stage tasmania australia 1 introduction bankfull is a fundamental concept in fluvial geomorphology with significant applications in relation to hydrological and ecological processes knighton 1998 wohl 2010 navratil et al 2010 lindroth et al 2020 it is also an important parameter in river rehabilitation habitat creation and river management projects he and wilkerson 2011 tedford and ellison 2018 the elevation or depth at which bankfull occurs known as the bankfull stage is a widely used measure of river flow and it is commonly applied in three ways firstly bankfull stage marks the point above which the river channel becomes connected with the floodplain when discharge exceeds bankfull stage biotic and abiotic elements including aquatic organisms vegetation sediment and nutrients are transferred and redistributed bouwman et al 2013 consequently the frequency and extent with which flow exceeds the channel has important ecological and geomorphological consequences and is also of importance to infrastructure design flood mapping and insurance risk dutta et al 2003 richards 2004 secondly the discharge which occurs at bankfull stage is linked to channel formation in a highly influential work wolman and miller 1960 showed that while discharge events of varying magnitude frequency and temporal structure influence channel form the channel morphology of alluvial rivers appears to be associated with flows at or near the bankfull stage the relationship between channel shape and bankfull discharge has since been widely debated particularly in australia pickup and warner 1976 australian rivers have important differences to those in other continents having more variable flow regimes finlayson and mcmahon 1988 additionally they have sediment loads dominated by fine suspended particles and with reduced coarse sediment load relative to other continents because of tectonic stability and the almost complete absence of quaternary glaciations tooth and nanson 1995 however concepts of a channel forming discharge to which the channel geometry becomes adjusted continue to be central to fluvial geomorphology studies doyle et al 2007 monegaglia and tubino 2019 the third common bankfull stage application is its use as a reference level which can reasonably be defined amongst the complexity of river morphology knighton 1998 in this role bankfull is widely used to compare spatial and temporal variations in river metrics powell et al 2006 buraas et al 2014 lindroth et al 2020 bankfull parameters such as bankfull stage bankfull width and bankfull discharge are extensively used in hydrological and geomorphic studies as well as in river channel classification rosgen 1994 kasprak et al 2016 river health assessment systems ausrivas 2020 and applications in remote sensing of river discharge bjerklie 2007 bjerklie et al 2018 1 1 definitions of bankfull stage the variety of bankfull stage applications have led to several definitions williams 1978 radecki pawlik 2002 which can give conflicting results he 2019 in some studies bankfull stage has been defined in a theoretical sense attained when water reaches a point not necessarily associated with the physical top of the banks stream systems technology center 1993 these theoretical definitions commonly equate bankfull stage with an abstract discharge such as bankfull stage corresponds to the discharge at which channel maintenance is the most effective dunne and leopold 1978 or relate it to the recurrence frequency of a flood event such as the stage occupied by the 1 58 year flood on the annual series dury et al 1963 pickup 1976 in contrast to the theoretical definitions a range of physical definitions of bankfull stage have been made based on recognition of sedimentary surfaces observation or measurement of boundary features or geometrical properties williams 1978 malik and pal 2020 among many of these physical definitions differences exist on the particular stage at which bankfull occurs definitions range from the stage at which discharge just fills the river channel without overflowing onto the floodplain williams 1978 gordon et al 2004 gomez et al 2007 the stage at which discharge just overflows the banks of the channel onto the floodplain page 1988 or the elevation of the active floodplain wolman and leopold 1957 wolman and miller 1960 fig 1 although the differences in elevation between these various definitions may be small at the point of bankfull minor increases in depth are often accompanied by large increases in width and a slight difference in interpreting bankfull stage elevation can lead to significantly different values in other bankfull parameters leopold et al 1964 wilkerson 2008 a comparison of bankfull methods on 16 river reaches across france found morphological definitions more relevant and a combination of methods best used navratil et al 2006 1 2 determination of bankfull stage using qualitative methods the most frequently used method to determine bankfull stage is based on qualitative field observations of evidence such as scour lines vegetation limits changes between bed and banks material abrupt changes in slope or most commonly the active floodplain however floodplains are not always present they may be difficult to identify and they may not relate to the current river form for example in eastern australia many rivers show a channel geometry and planform fundamentally altered from natural conditions with many apparent floodplains flooded relatively infrequently and not in adjustment with the present river regime iea 1987 brierley et al 1999 fryirs et al 2018 incised rivers in both queensland dury et al 1963 and new south wales woodyer 1968 show an active floodplain which is rather a bench contained within the channel while the apparent floodplain is in fact a terrace additionally within a river several benches may be present woodyer 1968 and bankfull stage may not always be associated with the same bench along a river reach radecki pawlik 2002 bankfull stage can be particularly difficult to identify in unstable rivers simon et al 2004 where there has been channel disconnection from the floodplain brierley et al 1999 fryirs et al 2018 or where the river is adjusting to a new equilibrium despite many detailed definitions of bankfull stage being developed in recognition of the difficulty in identifying the active floodplain gippel 1985 page 1988 de rose et al 2008 harman et al 2008 identifying bankfull stage in the field continues to rely on subjective judgment and may result in inconsistent estimates if observers do not have sufficient training or experience rosgen 2009 1 3 determination of bankfull stage using quantitative methods methods to develop more objective and repeatable methods for determining bankfull stage arose as fluvial geomorphology moved from qualitative to more quantitative techniques quantitative methods for determining bankfull stage offer considerable benefits over qualitative methods they do not rely on the presence of an active floodplain or other often subjective field evidence and they enable bankfull stage to be determined without field observations or expert assessment this allows the use of remotely sensed data or other data collected for purposes other than identifying bankfull stage in addition quantitative techniques generally use fewer resources than field based methods and are more objective williams 1978 however some studies have found that quantitative methods inadequately define bankfull stage riley 1972 gregory 1976 they do not provide significantly greater accuracy then visual field inspection williams 1978 or they are less relevant than morphological definitions navratil et al 2006 the two most commonly used quantitative methods are the minimum width to depth ratio and the first maximum of the bench index radecki pawlik 2002 finnegan et al 2005 simon and darby 1997 navratil et al 2006 yanites et al 2010 he 2019 conesa garcía et al 2020 few studies have previously directly compared the methods using a large regional dataset 1 3 1 width to depth ratio the ratio of the channel width w to mean channel depth d fig 2 has been extensively used as a measure of channel shape fig 1 and is determined according to eq 1 1 r wd w d the use of the width to depth ratio to determine bankfull stage is attributed to wolman 1955 defining bankfull as that stage at a given cross section at which in a plot of the width to depth ratio against stage the curve breaks sharply and the width becomes exceedingly large fig 2 however rather than associate this stage with the physical top of the channel banks wolman found that above this point the channel begins to flare out and depart from the more rectangular shape prevailing below this stage wolman 1955 this point may correspond with the bank inflection point fig 1 which corresponds to the main change in bank slope or the end of the abrupt part of the bank navratil et al 2006 several subsequent works have departed from wolman s methods and associated a top of bank bankfull with the stage at which the width to depth ratio is at a minimum harvey 1969 riley 1972 pickup and warner 1976 pickup 1976 johnson and heil 1996 copeland et al 2000 gordon et al 2004 gomez et al 2007 despite several studies showing that the minimum width to depth ratio generally underestimates bankfull stage riley 1972 williams 1978 navratil et al 2004 2006 this method continues to be used for determining bankfull stage from channel geometries conesa garcía et al 2020 lindroth et al 2020 1 3 2 bench index to develop a method for identifying bankfull stage that was less dependent on subjective judgment and more amenable to computer operations riley 1972 defined a bench index bi as 2 bi w i w i 1 d i d i 1 where i 1 2 3 x and x is the number of unique width and depth measurements available ranked in ascending value i e the greater the value of i the closer to the channel bed fig 2 the bench index measures the relative slope of a segment of channel profile with high values indicating relatively horizontal channel segments and low values defining relatively vertical segments riley 1972 fig 2 based on the results from 20 river sites in north western new south wales with a wide range of cross sectional areas and profile shapes riley found that when plotted against depth the bench index showed a marked peaked value near the bankfull stage indicating that bankfull stage was equivalent to the first maximum of the bench index when measured in descending elevations decreasing depth however several subsequent studies have found that the first maximum of the bi significantly overestimated bankfull stage on some reaches williams 1978 radecki pawlik 2002 navratil et al 2004 2006 from 7 cross sections across two polish rivers radecki pawlik 2002 rather found riley s bench index the more useful of several bankful parameters which is best defined as a discharge which appears within a certain range of discharges 1 4 aims this study uses data from 89 cross sectional surveys undertaken at nine river reaches in different catchments in north eastern tasmanian rivers a part of the world that is lesser known to the fluvial research community to compare the minimum width to depth ratio and the first maximum of the bench index against qualitative estimates of bankfull stage the study aims are to 1 evaluate two quantitative methods for determining bankfull stage from plotted cross sections 2 provide guidance on the determination and reporting of bankfull stage 2 methodology 2 1 environmental context the fluvial geomorphology of the rivers of tasmania a continental island located 41 43os has significant differences from those of mainland australia to the north the highly variable tasmanian landscape includes areas which have experienced relatively recent tectonic activity and glaciation sharples 1996 which combined with the large variations in hydrology and lithology has resulted in a wide variety of channel and floodplain forms across tasmanian catchments jerie et al 2003 north eastern tasmania is a region geologically and geomorphologically distinct sharples 1996 its marine turbidite rocks were initially deposited at some distance from the rest of tasmania then tectonically transported to their present position much of the region was subsequently uplifted with thin sequences of permian sedimentary rock then being deposited in the present highland areas before being intruded by extensive sheets of dolerite magma during the mid jurassic a temperate marine climate drives the dominant fluvial processes with occasional intense and sustained rainfall events which can cause major flooding in the north east keast and ellison 2013 despite some anthropogenic impacts including alluvial mining forestry agriculture and irrigation ellison et al 2019 and in contrast to much of south eastern australia the majority of rivers in north eastern tasmania remain largely unmodified and unregulated the nine study reaches were located on eight rivers across six catchments in north eastern tasmania fig 3 table 1 ranging in size from third river at paling track a first order river with an upstream catchment area of just 4 4 km2 to the south esk river at ormley a sixth order river with a catchment area of over 1360 km2 sites were either in unconfined or partially confined valley settings all sites were set in unconsolidated sediments with a river channel largely free to adjust to discharge this can be evidenced in the meandering planform of rivers fig 3 table 1 2 2 data channel cross sectional survey data for eight of the nine river reaches table 1 were obtained from the tasmanian department of primary industries parks water and environment dpipwe these survey data were collected for a variety of purposes including the establishment of environmental flow levels for each reach 5 12 cross sections were surveyed spaced 15 40 m apart surveys were undertaken using leica levels which provide depth accuracy estimated to be within 0 01 m and horizontal accuracy to be within 0 1 m the number of cross sections and their separation was generally based on the complexity of the physical form of the river channel as recommended by edwards et al 2019 more cross sections were undertaken on more variable channels to minimize error in bankfull stage parameter estimation harman et al 2008 rather than using prescriptive measures to identify site location and the number and location of cross sectional surveys place based understanding brierley et al 2013 was adopted where contextual considerations are used to detect important local differences allowing transferability of insights between locations and representative sample sites brierley et al 2013 third river at paling track table 1 for example was a relatively small upper catchment river with a simple channel that displayed little variability in channel morphology along the reach based on the relatively homogenous channel morphology 5 cross sectional surveys were considered sufficient to capture reach morphological variability additional cross sectional survey data collected from some sites were later excluded from the study due to the presence of bedrock outcrops or an anabranching channel making bankfull channel impossible to identify cross sections targeted a range of channel forms pool riffle run where they existed and included a range of channel types from simple channels to complex channels with features including in channel benches overbank terraces and flood chutes cross sectional surveys extended from above obvious bankfull flow levels on one bank to a similar elevation on the opposite river bank but focused on the proportion of the channel at and below the bankfull flow thresholds therefore at most sites surveying of the extended floodplain if present was not undertaken dpipwe 2010 all sites were surveyed at low flow conditions the software package win xspro grant et al 1992 was used to plot each cross section and to model cross sectional channel parameters at 0 01 m increments in stage from the deepest point of the channel to well above the maximum elevation of the lowest channel bank of the survey plots were modified in some instances by removing features such as flood chutes to ensure that only a single channel was considered at each increment all statistical analyses were undertaken using the software package r 2 3 minimum width to depth ratio wd the ratio of channel width to depth was calculated at 0 01 m stage increments for each cross section by dividing the channel width w by the mean depth d eq 1 following common practice this study defined mean depth as cross sectional area a divided by width w bankfull using the wd method was defined as the stage at which the minimum of the width to depth ratio occurred a lower limit of 50 of the maximum elevation of the lowest channel bank was set to eliminate low width to depth values which occurred at very low stages due to irregularities on the channel bed 2 4 first maximum of the bench index bi bankfull stage using the bench index was determined largely according to the methods of riley 1972 however as channel parameters were modelled at equal increments 0 01 m d i d i 1 remains constant and may be removed from eq 2 to produce 3 bench index bi w i w i 1 where i 1 2 3 x and x is the number of unique width and depth measurements available ranked in ascending value i e the greater the value of i the closer to the channel bed following riley 1972 the stage that corresponded with the first maximum of the bench index from upper the maximum elevation of the lowest channel bank to lower elevation was bankfull stage neither riley nor subsequent studies explained the method used to identify the maximum and in this study maxima were identified using a simple algorithm if bi i 1 bi i let bi i bi i 1 if bi i 1 bi i go to bi i 2 continue to repeat through to i 5 if bi i 5 bi i then bi i is equivalent to bankfull stage if bi i 1 bi i then bi i is equivalent to bankfull stage where consecutive increments had equivalent values the upper increment was determined to be equivalent to bankfull stage as this was thought to be more in line with the methods of riley 1972 2 5 qualitative estimates of bankfull stage this study adopted the physical definition of bankfull used by riley 1972 as the stage above which flow would exceed the active channel banks this was chosen as it provided the most objective and consistent definition for quantitative comparisons definitions based on floodplain elevation were rejected as being often subjective and because floodplains were not always present ideally bankfull stage models should be compared with the true bankfull stage however the chances of being present to measure bankfull parameters just at bankfull are extremely small williams 1978 and consequently bankfull stage values can only ever be an estimate in this study bankfull stage was estimated at each cross section by interpretation of plotted channel profiles with particular attention paid to channel morphological features which could be observed across several cross sections along a reach field observations and notes were used to assist this process where available a 3d multiple cross section plot was also created in some instances to ensure that the estimated bankfull elevation at each cross section was consistent along a reach 2 6 model evaluation this study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the performance of the two quantitative bankfull stage models it first compares the ratio between bankfull stage estimates derived using the minimum width to depth ratio wd and those determined using the first maxima of the bench index bi and conducts paired t tests to consider the differences between the two methods in comparison to the overall and within a reach variability this study also evaluates estimates of bankfull stage from the two quantitative bankfull stage models against qualitative estimates of bankfull stage using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr the combination of these three measures provides a comprehensive and relevant model assessment method moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a dimensionless statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance in comparison to the measured data variance moriasi et al 2007 nse is calculated using eq 4 4 nse 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y i mean 2 where y i obs is the ith observation for the constituent being evaluated y i s im is the ith simulated value for the constituent being evaluated y mean is the mean of observed data for the constituent being evaluated and n is the total number of observations moriasi et al 2007 nse values range between and 1 0 with nse 1 being the optimal value and values between 0 0 and 1 0 generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance values 0 0 indicate that the residual variance is larger than the data variance which indicates unacceptable performance moriasi et al 2007 to assist in identifying true outliers and assessing the relevance of calculated nse values z scores which are commonly used to provide a standardized measure of the distance of an observation from the mean were also determined for each qualitative estimate of bankfull stage bf using sample mean and standard deviation percent bias pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observed data and can indicate poor model performance gupta et al 1999 pbias is determined using eq 5 5 pbias i 1 n y i obs y i sim 100 i 1 n y i obs where pbias is the deviation of data being evaluated expressed as a percentage the optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values indicate model underestimation bias and negative values indicate model overestimation bias gupta et al 1999 the root mean square error rmse to the standard deviation of the measured data rsr is calculated by eq 6 6 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 rsr incorporates the commonly used error index statistic rmse with a scaling normalization factor that is based on the standard deviation of the observations rsr varies from the optimal value of 0 which indicates zero rmse or residual variation and therefore perfect model simulation to a large positive value the lower the rsr the lower the rmse and the better the model simulation performance moriasi et al 2007 bankfull stage model estimates were judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 following general model evaluation standards moriasi et al 2007 performance ratings for pbias depend on the application and in this study were set at 15 the results are also presented graphically as a plot of mean reach bankfull stage values with associated 95 confidence intervals ci non parametric confidence intervals were constructed using a bootstrap resampling method in r canty and ripley 2014 with 2000 iterations diciccio and efron 1996 3 results the mean ratios between bankfull stage values determined using the minimum width to depth ratio wd and those determined using the first maxima of the bench index bi for each reach as well as for the combined 89 individual cross sections along with the results of the paired t tests are shown in table 2 the results of bankfull stage model evaluation against qualitative estimates using nse rsr and pbias are shown in table 3 along with co efficient of variation cv values and graphs of reach averaged bankfull stage parameters and 95 confidence intervals calculated from bootstrapped samples for estimated and model derived bankfull stage are shown in fig 4 the mean ratio between wd and bi derived estimates across all 89 individual cross sections was 0 84 with a range of 0 56 0 96 for mean reach ratios between wd and bi derived estimates there was a significant overall difference between wd and bi derived estimates of bankfull stage t 10 35 df 88 p 0 0000 for the combined eighty nine cross sections and for seven of the nine reaches no significant difference for site 3 and site 7 table 2 bankfull stage values determined using the wd method were generally less than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage bf with an overall pbias value of 6 59 across all 89 cross sections and positive pbias values underestimation on eight of the nine reaches ranging from 1 22 to 29 50 table 3 pbias values fell below 15 on eight of the nine reaches nse values ranged from 1 97 to 0 96 with four reaches having nse values less than or equal to 0 50 rsr values ranged from 0 20 to 1 72 with four reaches having values greater than or equal to 0 70 four of the nine reaches fell outside satisfactory model performance based on the evaluation of moriasi et al 2007 the wd derived mean reach bankfull stage fell within the 95 confidence intervals for bf on all reaches apart from sites 6 and 8 and the 95 confidence intervals for wd derived mean reach bankfull stage overlapped the 95 confidence intervals for bf on all reaches apart from site 6 fig 4 bankfull stage values determined using the bi method were generally greater than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage bf with an overall pbias value of 9 55 across all 89 cross sections and negative pbias values overestimation on all nine reaches ranging from 0 58 to 56 84 table 3 pbias values were less than 15 from bf values on four of the nine reaches nse values ranged from 2 52 0 97 with six reaches having nse values less than or equal to 0 50 rsr values ranged from 0 16 to 1 88 with six reaches having values greater than or equal to 0 70 six of the nine reaches fell outside satisfactory model performance moriasi et al 2007 the bi derived mean reach bankfull stage fell within the 95 ci for bf on all reaches apart from site 1 fig 4 several reaches had individual bf values which may be considered outliers with five of the eighty nine cross sections having z scores exceeding 1 75 however there was not a strong correlation between reaches with bf outliers and those which had low nse values for either bi or wd the range of values between the upper and lower 95 ci of bf was fully contained between the upper 95 ci of bi and the lower 95 ci of wd for each site the co efficient of variation cv for qualitative estimates of bankfull stage bf along a reach ranged from 0 06 to 0 44 table 3 while the cv for the minimum width to depth ratio wd ranged from 0 09 to 0 41 and the cv for first maxima of the bench index estimates of bankfull stage bi along a reach ranged from 0 05 to 0 30 table 3 there was similarity in the patterns of cv variability between sites for wd bi and bf variation between bankfull stage bf width to depth ratio wd and bench index bi bankfull stage values for individual cross sections along three example reaches third river at paling track site 1 the nile river at nile site 5 and isis the river at isis site 6 are shown in figs 5 7 and 9 respectively channel profiles for selected cross sections from each of the three examples are shown in figs 6 8 and 10 bankfull estimates at third river at paling track fig 5 varied both between methods and along the reach there was also considerable variation in the way the three estimates differed between cross sections at cross section 1 the wd estimate was close to the bf estimate both of which were below bf mean reach bankfull stage with the bi estimate well above these fig 5 the river at this cross section had a sloping channel bank on one side and a relatively vertical bank on the other side with rounded top of channel banks and a poorly defined floodplain fig 6 cross section 4 of third river at paling track had quite closely clustered bf wd and bi estimates fig 5 and the river channel at this cross section had more vertical banks breaking to a horizontal section of floodplain on one side fig 6 nile river at nile had relatively low variability in estimates of bankfull stage from cross section 1 to 8 but cross sections 9 12 showed a strong rise and fall in bankfull stage fig 7 cross section 3 of nile river at nile had a bi estimate equal to the bf estimate with the wd estimate well below these and outside the 95 ci of mean reach bf the river at this cross section had slightly sloping channel banks and rounded top of channel banks fig 8 cross section 8 of nile river at nile had both wd and bi estimates equal to bf estimates fig 7 the channel at this cross section had a clearly defined break between river channel and floodplain with the floodplain angling downwards away from the top of channel fig 8 cross section 11 of the nile river at nile had wd estimates similar to bf estimates with bi estimates well above both fig 7 the river channel at this location had a well defined break between channel and floodplain but the floodplain angled upwards away from the channel fig 8 there were no strong trends in bankfull estimates along the reach at the isis river at isis fig 9 cross section 2 from the isis river at isis had large differences between bf wd and bi estimates the channel at this location had sloping banks and a floodplain that sloped upwards away from the river channel fig 10 the river channel at cross section 8 had a very different shape with more vertical banks and a well defined horizontal section of floodplain between the main channel and a flood chute fig 10 and had closely clustered bf wd and bi estimates fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 minimum width to depth ratio wd results showed that the minimum width to depth ratio provided smaller mean reach estimates of bankfull stage than the bench index on all study reaches with significantly smaller estimates occurring on seven of the nine reaches table 2 minimum width to depth ratio estimates were rated as unsatisfactory for four of the nine reaches when assessed against qualitative estimates being generally smaller than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage table 3 these results support the outcomes of previous studies which have found that the minimum width to depth ratio often underestimates bankfull stage riley 1972 williams 1978 navratil et al 2004 2006 results showed that the wd performed better on channel cross sections with rectangular channel profiles for example it identified a mean reach bankfull stage almost identical to that of qualitative estimates at site 7 ringarooma river at the wetlands with a largely rectangular channel profile but performed poorly against qualitative estimates at site 6 isis river at isis with a complex channel with benches on several cross sections and a large flood chute across the floodplain riley 1972 found the minimum width to depth ratio to be dependent on channel shape close to the actual bankfull stage for channels with rectangular profiles but nearer the channel bed for channels with shallow profiles and gently sloping banks the minimum width to depth ratio identifies the point above which the channel begins to flare out and depart from the more rectangular shape below wolman 1955 and comparisons of width to depth plots with channel profiles from many of the cross sections in this study supported this view fig 11 4 2 first maximum of the bench index bi the bi method provided larger mean reach estimates of bankfull stage than the minimum width to depth ratio on all study reaches with a significant difference occurring on seven of the nine reaches table 2 the bi method performed less well against qualitative estimates than the wd method overall with only three of the nine reaches rated satisfactory however on the reaches where the performance of the bi method was satisfactory nse rsr and pbias values were better than those of the wd method the bi method provided bankfull stage values much higher than the estimated bankfull stage on some reaches with pbias values ranging up to 56 84 table 3 these results support those of previous studies which have found that the first maximum of the bench index significantly overestimated bankfull stage on some reaches williams 1978 radecki pawlik 2002 navratil et al 2004 2006 the bi method generally performed poorly where the channel had a sloping bank on one or both sides of the river channel breaking into a sloping floodplain and best where the channel banks were more perpendicular and the floodplain more horizontal figs 5 10 the results from this study highlight areas where the bench index method may be improved meeting the suggestions of williams 1978 firstly a maximum of the bi other than the first often occurred at a stage equivalent to qualitative estimates of bankfull stage fig 11 the location of the first maximum of the bench index is dependent on the upper limit of the cross sectional profile to which it is applied riley 1972 and in this study where plotted channel profiles extended well above the bankfull channel the first maximum often occurred at a stage well above the qualitative estimate of bankfull several studies have also found that the first maxima corresponded with an elevation above bankfull navratil et al 2004 and that maxima other than the first are equivalent to bankfull stage radecki pawlik 2002 navratil et al 2006 this supports findings of riley 1972 that subjective judgment is still required to define the traverse limits around the approximate bankfull channel to ensure the correct bench index maxima is identified secondly bench index maxima often occurred at an increment above qualitative estimates of bankfull stage e g table 4 maxima of the bench index occur where there are large increases in width relative to increase in stage riley 1972 and many cross sections in this study showed large increases in width just above the top of the channel bank fig 11 resulting in a large peak in the bench index as bankfull is defined as the stage above which the flow exceeds the active channel banks riley 1972 the increment prior at a lower elevation to a maximum of the bench index was often equivalent to the best estimate of bankfull stage differences in elevation between these two stages were small 0 01 m but near bankfull small increases in stage can result in large increases in other parameters gordon et al 2004 wilkerson 2008 in this study a single 0 01 m increment in stage resulted in an increase in channel width of more than 3 m for some sites a channel cross section from the nile river at nile for example showed a qualitative estimate of bankfull stage of 2 65 m with a width of 22 91 m while the bi estimate of bankfull stage was 2 67 m with a width of 27 54 fig 12 table 4 an increase in stage of just 0 02 m resulting in a difference of 4 63 m in bankfull width estimated bankfull stage for this cross section using wd was 2 68 m with a width of 27 65 m these results reflect the geometry of the channel at this location where discharge at around bankfull levels resulted in the channel becoming connected with the floodplain via a floodchute fig 12 4 3 reach variability results showed no clear relationship between the success or failure of wd or bi estimates and observed reach variability table 3 the similarity in the patterns of coefficient of variation cv variability between sites table 3 for each of the three methods indicate that the variability in bankfull stage is due to natural variability rather than model error or bias while the high individual cv values for all estimates of bankfull stage along a reach wd bi and bf table 3 strongly support the view radecki pawlik 2002 that bankfull stage should be defined as a range of values rather than as a single number related strictly to the geometry of a particular cross section to investigate the potential influence of landscape setting on bankfull stage estimation and bankfull stage variability further three sites were examined in more detail third river at paling track site 1 is partially confined table 1 set in a landscape of moderately steep hills ridges and spurs with flat alluvial valleys in many reaches the channel is trapezoidal in shape fig 6 and showed the highest cv for bf estimates along a reach for all sites table 3 and fig 5 the wd method was assessed to have performed satisfactorily on this reach while bi performance was assessed as unsatisfactory table 3 bi generally performed poorly on those cross sections which had sloping channel banks and best where the channel banks were more vertical figs 5 and 6 nile river at nile site 5 has a trapezoidal channel morphology fig 8 and is located on an unconfined reach set in a low relief landscape table 1 composed of broad valleys on tertiary sediment the site has poor riparian vegetation the reach experiences reasonably high stream power values with a slope of 0 005 m m it had a low cv along a reach for all three methods of estimating bankfull stage but significant differences existed between mean reach estimates of wd and bi table 3 and fig 7 wd estimates performed satisfactory against bf estimates but bi fell outside satisfactory model performances isis river at isis site 6 is a narrow channel fig 10 of an unconfined reach set in a low relief landscape table 1 composed of broad valleys on tertiary sediments there is little riparian vegetation along the channel banks and stock have unrestricted access to the river the channel along this reach is highly variable and quite complex with a well developed flood chute or smaller secondary channel present in some parts stream power is relatively small at this reach due to the low slope it showed quite a high cv for bf and both wd and bi model performances were outside satisfactory model performances table 3 and fig 9 these case studies illustrate the high variability in a range of hydrological and morphological parameters within a region and indicate that variability in bankfull stage along a reach is not necessarily associated with river type sites with partially confined river types included the two sites with the highest variability in reach bankfull stage and the two sites with the lowest variability tables 1 and 3 4 4 defining and reporting bankfull stage 4 4 1 defining bankfull stage the results of this study provide two contributions to the definition of bankfull stage first high variability in bankfull stage estimates found along a reach support that an individual cross section is insufficient to define bankfull stage bankfull stage should be reported as a mean reach value using cross sections based on contextual considerations of place based understanding brierley et al 2013 second results found that small increments in stage can bring about significant variability in process responses such as within channel and channel floodplain linkages at bankfull level a very small increment in stage can result in significant differences in the width of the water surface as discharge in the main channel becomes connected with the floodplain due to the natural variability in channel morphology the river channel generally becomes connected with the floodplain via smaller flood chutes along the reach while discharge is still constrained within the banks at other points on the same reach the high variability in bankfull parameters as discharge approaches bankfull stage is illustrated in the north esk river site fig 13 prior to bankfull stage discharge is fully constrained within the river channel banks as discharge nears bankfull stage discharge overflows the banks at lower points along the reach flowing into flood chutes which direct discharge onto the floodplain and create a wide water surface however even after the flood chutes have substantial flow the reach channel banks constrain the discharge to the main channel at many points 4 4 2 reporting bankfull stage results from this study show that bankfull stage is best reported as a mean reach value as values determined from a single cross section are misleading bankfull stage should be defined using an expected range with a measure of the level of confidence that the result falls within the actual value of population mean confidence intervals consider the sample size as well as the variability standard deviation of the sample it is therefore recommended that estimates of mean bankfull stage are reported with confidence intervals generally 95 as well as the number of observations used it is also recommended to follow navratil 2006 that the bankfull definitions used should be specified in detail when reporting bankfull stage estimates as an example of this reporting method the estimated mean reach bankfull stage for the nile river at nile using the definition of riley 1972 is 2 54 m n 12 95 ci 2 30 2 77 however it should be noted that confidence intervals only communicate uncertainty associated with sampling error and cannot describe or control non sampling error walshe et al 2007 any method not using complex statistical techniques will necessarily include uncertainty based on sample representativeness observer or method error and measurement error tayfur and singh 2011 5 conclusions the two most frequently used quantitative methods for determining bankfull stage were evaluated on 89 channel cross sections on eight rivers in north eastern tasmania across a range of channel sizes and cross sectional shapes these evaluation measures demonstrated that neither the minimum width to depth ratio nor the first maximum of the bench index provided a satisfactory accurate objective and repeatable method to determine bankfull stage from plotted channel geometries across all study reaches the minimum width to depth ratio provided lower mean reach values of bankfull stage than the first maximum of the bench index for all sites and generally provided lower values than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage but was the best performed of the two models overall when assessed against qualitative estimates this study supports previous understanding that the minimum width to depth ratio approximates to the stage above which increases in width becomes more rapid than increases in mean depth harvey 1969 rather than identifying bankfull stage consequently the performance of this method is dependent on channel shape the first maximum of the bench index provided larger values than qualitative estimates of bankfull stage on all reaches and performed less well when compared against qualitative estimates than the minimum width to depth ratio it performed best when channel banks were relatively perpendicular and there was a sudden transition to a horizontal floodplain the accuracy of the bench index method may be significantly improved by either limiting the range of analysis to the approximate bankfull stage or considering a maximum other than the first and by equating bankfull stage with the increment below maxima of the bench index while these results support views that there is no precise analytical method for determining bankfull value radecki pawlik 2002 they also show that these two methods provide a useful adjunct in the subjective determination of bankfull stage as the true value generally lies between the values provided by these two methods whilst the best method for the determination of bankfull stage at any particular location is dependent on a wide range of factors including objectives available resources type of waterway and setting based on the results from this study a number of recommendations are made 1 bankfull stage should be considered at the reach rather than cross sectional scale this is supported by the high variability in bankfull stage estimates along a reach found in the study 2 the determination of bankfull stage should incorporate multiple lines of evidence where possible as the true bankfull stage value generally lies between the minimum width to depth ratio and the first maxima of the bench index the use of these two methods can provide a useful check for estimates determined from field observations hydrological models or other methods 3 bankfull stage should be presented as a range of values with associated confidence intervals rather than as a finite result the number of samples and the definition of bankfull stage estimates should also be reported as an example the estimated mean reach bankfull stage using the definition of riley 1972 for the nile river at nile using field based observations in conjunction with plotted channel geometries is 2 54 m n 12 95 ci 2 30 2 77 4 where a single automated method for estimating bankfull stage from plotted channel geometries or digital terrain models is required the minimum width to depth ratio provides better estimates that the first maxima of the bench index credit authorship contribution statement david keast conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data

7952,study region the dongting lake dtl wetland china study focus at present there are few studies on ecohydrological assessments based on the collaborative study of flow and water level the focus of this study is to use ecologically meaningful indicators environmental flow components method and range of variability approach method to evaluate the dynamic process of flow and water level components whose changes have a negative impact on the dtl wetland ecosystem in addition we quantitatively expressed the ecological response process of flow and water level under changing environments and proposed to use the underlying surface parameters to further clarify the impact of human activities and climate change evaporation and rainfall on runoff in different time periods new hydrological insights for the region after the construction of the three gorges dam the components of environmental flow in dtl were reduced and the overall change of the flow and water level of the dtl was 37 and 36 respectively the results of the wetland ecological response coincided with the trend of habitat fragmentation and miniaturization of fish individuals in dtl the underlying surface parameters show that the weight of the impact of climate change on runoff is increasing and the contribution rate of driving forces human activities evaporation and rainfall to runoff are 49 32 20 88 and 29 80 respectively and to water levels are 60 00 21 3 and 18 7 respectively keywords ecohydrology hydrological regime ecological response flow and water level dongting lake 1 introduction the natural and reasonable fluctuation of wetland hydrological process is one of the important driving forces to maintain the wetland hydrological environment and its biodiversity ecohydrological regime is the coupling process between biological and hydrological process fan et al 2014 gabiri et al 2018 quantitative assessment of wetland ecohydrology regimes is a prerequisite for understanding the health status of wetland ecosystem finding a management paradigm for sustainable regulation of wetland water resources and comprehensively improving the service function of wetland ecosystem zhang et al 2016 for lake wetlands flow and water level relationships are the focus of consideration in hydrology habitat relationship studies through the qualitative and quantitative description of the relationship between the hydrological regime indicators and the ecological indicators the response law of the ecosystem to different hydrological regimes can be obtained the hydrological regime change mechanism and ecological response process of wetlands in changing environments are complex and diverse in the change of hydrological regimes the runoff water level directly acts on the vertical and horizontal structure of the wetland ecosystem therefore clarifying the contribution of different factors to the change of runoff and water level is an essential link for the in depth understanding of the interaction mechanism between wetland ecology and hydrology and wetland ecohydrology assessment liu et al 2020 human activities and climate change are important factors affecting the hydrological regime changes of wetlands however at present most studies analyze the impact of runoff and water level on the study area separately and also no detailed classification of climatic factors there as one of the 200 critical ecological regions globally dongting lake dtl wetland plays a vital role in water conservation regional climate regulation and biodiversity maintenance at the same time dtl wetland is an essential support for the sustainable economic development of hunan province china geng et al 2020 salimi et al 2021 the ecohydrological processes of dtl change due to human activities and climate change thus having an impact on the ecosystem cyclical changes in runoff and water levels for example are reducing the dtl habitat area dong and zhang 2011 zhu et al 2021 yu et al 2018 found that the changes of water sediment in dtl from 1951 to 2014 could be divided into four main phases under the influence of the three factors of jingjiang cutoffs jc gezhou dam gd and three gorges dam tgd the water sediment is decreasing step by step the factors affecting the water level change in the dtl basin are different from water sediment compared with water sediment affected by many factors the factors affecting water level change can be divided into two categories the first category is the direct influence of the hydrological regime of the mainstream of the yangtze river the second category is the joint influence of the runoff into the lake and the mainstream of the yangtze river cheng et al 2017 some scholars quantitatively evaluated the change degree of the above hydrological regimes for example wang et al 2021 used the indicators of hydrological alteration range of variability approach iha rva method to assess the daily water level of dtl from 1959 to 2016 the water level from 1959 to 2002 is the natural water level series and from 2003 to 2016 is the post anthropogenic influence series the change of water level in dtl was 50 yu et al 2020 used eight methods for attribution analysis of runoff changes in dtl they found that climate change played a dominant role in runoff changes during 1984 2004 and human activities played a dominant role in runoff changes during 2005 2019 using 1961 1983 as the base period therefore we conducted a quantitative assessment of changes in the flow and water level of dtl using ecological indicators and shannon index to reflect ecological response processes under variability in the ecohydrological regimes of dtl took 2003 as the changing point the budyko coupled water energy balance theory and the slope change ratio of accumulative quantity method were used to clarify the contribution rate of anthropogenic disturbance and important components of climate precipitation and evaporation to the runoff and the water level and to quantitatively analyze the specific change process of the underlying surface of dtl wetland the results of this research will be a valuable reference for objectively understanding the driving forces in dtl and the results will provide guidance to the decision maker on regional ecological restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dtl 111 14 113 10 e 28 30 30 23 n is not only the second largest freshwater lake in china but also the natural storage lake of the yangtze river fig 1 the area of dtl was reduced from 6 000 km2 before 1825 to 2 651 km2 in 1999 the water level of chenglingji hydrographic stations was 33 5 m it frequently exchanges with the river water of the yangtze river and the water exchange frequency is short about 18 2 d the lake area is located in the climate zone of transition from the central subtropics to the northern subtropics with an annual average temperature of 16 4 17 0 an average temperature of 4 0 4 5 in january and an average temperature of 29 0 in july the precipitation in the basin is ample and concentrated and the precipitation varies significantly from year to year the average annual precipitation is 1 100 mm to 1 400 mm and the rainfall from april to june accounts for more than 50 of the total precipitation in the whole year creeks on the outer edge of dtl are intertwined small lakes dotted embankment vertical and horizontal 2 2 data preparation the data of runoff water sediment and water level in this study are derived from the yangtze river water conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources of

xiangtan zishui taojiang yuanjiang taoyuan and lishui shimen the water level data came from chenglingji hydrographic station which is located at the only outlet of dtl the meteorological data are selected from the meteorological stations of yueyang nanxian changde and yuanjiang in the dtl basin all from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend free pre whitening mann kendall test tfpw mk the mann kendall mk trend test method is often used to test the trend of long time series which has the advantage of being independent of outliers and does not require satisfying a specific probability distribution jiang et al 2020 however this method is affected by the autocorrelation of data itself and needs improvement in this study the trend free pre whitening tfpw test was used to improve it zhang et al 2013 the specific calculation steps of tfpw mk method are as follows 1 β median x j x i j i 2 y t x t t t x t β t 3 y t y t r 1 y t 1 4 y t y t t t where j i β represents the linear trend of the sequence to be tested y t represents a sequence without trend terms r 1 means a correlation coefficient of y t y t means a sequence after removing autocorrelation terms t t is a reimbursement trend term y t is a new sequence without autocorrelation mk significance test was performed on the new sequences 5 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i wheresgn θ

conversely the sequence has no increasing or decreasing trend 2 3 2 environmental flow components efcs environmental flow components efcs are the flow and process needed to maintain the river s ecological environment it is composed of five flow events low flows 1 12 extreme low flows 13 16 high flow pulses 17 22 small floods 23 28 and large floods 29 34 with a total of 34 indicators as shown in table 1 the threshold division of related flow events are defined in the reference richter and thomas 2007 the coefficient of dispersion c d reflects the deviation degree of each index from the mean value and the deviation factor f d represents the deviation of each index value from the reference period before and after anthropogenic disturbance eappen et al 2020 which is calculated according to the following formula 8 c d h l m 9 f d d pre d post d pre where l m and h are the 25th percentile 50th percentile and 75th percentile of each hydrological sequence before and after the disturbance of anthropogenic disturbance d pre and d post represent the values of efcs indexes before and after anthropogenic disturbance respectively 2 3 3 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha richter et al 1996 proposed the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha to reflect the hydrological regime of rivers including indicators from four aspects flow event frequency and change rate as shown in table 2 2 3 4 range of variability approach rva richter et al 1997 proposed the range of variability approach rva method based on the iha to evaluate changes in the hydrological regime the degree of change d i for a single hydrological indicator is calculated as follows 10 d i p o p e p e 100 where p 0 denotes the frequency at which the hydrological parameters fall within the target range of flow management after hydrological variation p e represents the expectation which refers to the range of ecohydrology target interval the expectation in this study is 50 d i is a positive value indicating that the parameters of the hydrological series after variation fall in the target interval higher than expected if d i is negative it means that the parameters of the variant hydrological series fall lower than expected in the target interval when d i 67 the variation of hydrological parameters are considered to be high h when 34 d i 67 it is considered that the change degree of hydrological parameters is medium m when d i 34 the change degree of hydrological parameters is low l an overall degree of hydrological alteration d o is defined as follows 11 d o 1 33 i 1 33 d i 2 0 5 2 3 5 evaluation of ecological diversity in addition we used the fluvial biodiversity shannon indexes si to represent the ecological response process under the change of hydrological regime in dtl it is a regression equation based on iha indicators and genetic programming method h yang et al 2008 y yang et al 2008 the calculation formula is as follows 12 s i d min m i n 7 d min w 3 w 5 m i n 3 2 m a x 3 r r a t e where d min represents the julian date of minimum water level w 3 and w 5 mean the average flows in march and may respectively min3 and min7 denote annual minimum 3 d and 7 d average flow respectively max3 is the maximum yearly 3 d average flow r rate is the rate of overflowing 2 3 6 budyko coupled water energy balance theory for the attribution analysis of runoff change we used the budyko coupled water energy balance theory the basin s long term water balance can be expressed as 13 r p e δ s where r means the average runoff depth mm p means average precipitation mm e represents the average actual evaporation mm δs is water storage change mm in the long time scale runoff change δs is 0 based on budyko hypothesis choudhury 1999 and y yang et al 2008 h yang et al 2008 combined with the empirical formula of annual evaporation and applied the methods of dimensional analysis and mathematical statistics to deduce the water balance equation at the annual average scale namely 14 r p p e t 0 p n e t 0 1 n where et 0 means potential evapotranspiration n as characteristic parameters of the watershed underlying surface since p et 0 and n are independent variables it is known that r p and et 0 can deduce n the sensitivity of r to various factors can be expressed by the elastic coefficient as follows 15 ε x r x x r where x can be expressed as p et a or n according to the elastic coefficient of runoff to each influencing factor the change amount caused by the influencing factor to the runoff depth can be obtained finally the total change amount of runoff depth δ r can be obtained by summing up which is expressed as follows 16 δ r δ r p δ r e t 0 δ r n the contribution rate of each factor to runoff change is calculated according to the following formula 17 η p δ r p δ r 100 η e t 0 δ r e t 0 δ r 100 η n δ r n δ r 100 2 3 7 slope change ratio of accumulative quantity scraq we used the slope change ratio of accumulative quantity method to analyze the attribution of water level change wang et al 2012 according to the budyko coupled water energy balance theory the difference runoff depth between rainfall and actual evaporation was used to replace the evolution of water level the contribution rates of precipitation p actual evaporation e and human activities are quantified respectively the specific calculation steps are as follows 18 w x s x post s x pre s x pre where x represents r p e respectively s pre and s post represents the slope of the mutation before and after respectively the contribution rate of each factor can be written as 19 c p w p w r 100 c e w e w r 100 c h u m a n 1 c p c e 3 results 3 1 evolution characteristics of flow and water level the interannual trend of annual average flow and water level at chenglingji hydrological station of dtl from 1984 to 2019 is displayed in fig 2 the consequence shows that the average yearly flow and water level alteration is synchronous catastrophic floods in 1988 and severe droughts in 2011 had more significant impacts on runoff according to tfpw mk test results fig 3 the annual average discharge and annual average water level from 1984 to 2019 showed increasing and decreasing trends respectively the flow showed a significant upward trend from 1992 to 2002 still none of them passed the significance test zannual average flow 0 142 zannual average water level 0 284 z α 0 05 1 96 analysis of variation trend of flow and water level in the year fig 4 shows that the peak value of flow in the wet period after the construction of tgd was significantly weakened the water level was still synchronized with the flow in the wet period and there was an upward trend in the dry season the maximum upward appreciation was 0 87 m in early march 3 2 evaluation of environmental flow components efcs after the dam s construction the flow peak value of the small floods event decreases fig 5 extremely low flow and water level events no longer occur the composition of efcs declines the operation of the tgd has a strong peak cutting effect on the annual flow and the water level and eventually leads to a narrow range of flow and water levels the quantitative assessment of flow and water level of efcs in dtl pre and post construction of the tgd show that the deviation coefficient of the low flow flow reached 27 32 and 24 in february october and november while the deviation coefficients were smaller in the remaining months fig 6 the average duration index and peak index of the extreme low flow flow are greatly affected by dam construction and their deviation coefficients reach 68 and 100 respectively the deviation coefficient of the peak index of the high flow pulse flow is equivalent to that of the average duration index of the small flood flow and the deviation coefficient of the decline rate index of the major flood flow reaches 100 as for the deviation coefficient of water level the fluctuation of the low flow water level deviation coefficient from january to december is inconspicuous the average duration deviation coefficient of the extreme low flow water level has changed by 76 which is much higher than the 30 55 of the average duration and rise rate of the high flow pulse water level and the small flood water level the large flood water level disappears due to dam construction so zero deviation coefficient in general the greatly affected events include the extreme low flow flow and water level and the large and small floods flow and water level 3 3 quantitative assessment of hydrological regime change table 3 and fig 7 show the change quantification results of 31 hydrological indicators in 5 groups of all iha indicators flow only the median flow in may reached a high level of change 75 with 13 moderate indicators accounting for 42 among the water level indicators the median water level variation grade in july and september reaches a height change 84 and 68 respectively moderately changed indicators accounted for 29 after the construction of the tgd the overall flow and water level indicators of dongting lake showed moderate changes which were 37 and 36 respectively in addition the commonality analysis of the hydrological change degree of the flow rate and the water level shows that there are 4 same indicators that have a greater degree of change flow in february 60 water level 44 flow in october 58 water level 52 the occurrence time of the annual minimum flow 60 the occurrence time of the annual minimum water level 52 the number of annual flow fluctuations 58 and the number of annual water level fluctuations 63 the natural hydrological regime flow and water level of the wetland is being changed which may have more negative impact than positive on the habitat quality of dtl 3 4 quantitative assessment of ecological response fig 8 depicts the interannual variability of the shannon index of flow and water level in dtl from 1984 to 2019 indicating the volatility of the ecological response mechanism in dtl as hydrological circumstances vary according to the results of tfpw mk method the standardized test statistic zflow 0 739 zwater level 0 055 z 1 96 critical value at α 0 05 for the si of flow and water level show that the si of flow and water level present a decreasing trend from 1984 to 2019 still they all cannot pass the significance testing average the si of flow reduced by 9 after dam construction compared to pre dam construction and the si of water level decreased by 8 the similarity between the two shows that the negative impact of the construction of the tgd on the ecological environment can not be overlooked 3 5 analysis of diversified driving forces the calculated results of the elastic coefficients of various factors are shown in table 4 according to the calculation results the change process of underlying surface parameter n under the influence of human activities is further analyzed fig 8 the underlying surface parameters n before and after dam construction are 1 50 and 1 94 according to the outcome analysis of the underlying surface parameters in multiple periods the underlying surface parameters have been declining before the construction of the tgd indicating that the impact of human activities on runoff is decreasing and the effect of climate change on runoff is increasing after the dam was built the underlying surface parameters n increased abruptly from period 4 1999 2003 to 5 2004 2008 then started to decrease gradually afterwards fig 9 indicating that although the impact of climate change on runoff is increasing the impact of human activities on runoff is still at a relatively high level human activities have visible stage characteristics from the distribution of underlying surface parameters during periods 1 1984 1988 5 2004 2008 and 6 2009 2013 human activities have the most significant impact on runoff and least influence in periods 3 1994 1998 and 4 1999 2003 precipitation accumulation evaporation accumulation and water level accumulation pre and post construction of the dam are linearly correlated with years fig 10 therefore it is reasonable to distinguish the impacts of human activities and climate change on the hydrological regime of dtl by using the slope change ratio of the accumulative quantity method the contribution rates of different factors to dtl runoff and water level changes are shown in fig 10 the sensitivity of runoff to rainfall changes is stronger than that of water level and the contribution rate of rainfall to runoff changes is 29 8 which is 11 1 larger than the contribution rate of water level changes the water level is more sensitive to human activities than runoff and the contribution rate of human activities to water level changes is 60 which is 10 68 larger than the contribution rate to runoff changes therefore human activity is an important factor in the change of hydrological regimes in dtl and the contribution of evaporation to runoff change and water level change is almost equal which is 20 88 and 21 3 respectively fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 ecohydrological regimes and their drivers in this study the ecohydrological regime variation of dtl is quantitatively analyzed in terms of the annual variation of flow and water level the characteristics of efcs and the degree of hydrological change we found that the changes in parameter characteristics duration occurrence time and frequency of efcs and iha for flow and water level remained similar after 2003 the duration and occurrence time in particular plays a central role in sustaining native biodiversity and is one of the most influential regulators offish life history strategies and community structure fox and magoulick 2019 the plant community composition and productivity were closely related to submergence duration time and inundation frequency deng et al 2013 therefore the reduction of the above mentioned ecohydrological parameters in dtl has brought negative benefits to the fish community structure and plant community productivity although the drivers that cause changes in the above ecohydrological characteristics are classified into climate change rainfall and evaporation and human activities they can still be further differentiated for example human activities can be classified as dam operation land use change the operation of the tgd resulted in a decrease of 26 357 billion m3 17 228 billion m3 and 7 874 billion m3 in the annual runoff of in chenglingji jto and the four river respectively the contribution rates of jto and the four river to the inflow of dtl were 23 and 77 respectively our study confirmed that climate change precipitation and evaporation affects runoff and water level by 50 68 and 40 respectively and these findings support the conclusions of yuan et al 2016 but runoff is more sensitive to climate change and water levels are more sensitive to human activity the water level in dtl wetlands could regulate the hydrological environment and affect water conservation hu et al 2020 therefore on this basis the decision maker can use the sensitive characteristics of water level to human activities combined with the components in efcs flow and water level that are beneficial to habitat quality and conduct appropriate artificial regulation through reservoir group adjust the rising duration and falling speed of the flood peak in a timely manner to slow down the impact on aquatic organisms in addition the ecological environment of dtl wetlands was actually affected by human activities from 1984 to 1988 fig 9 but the fluctuations were not significant and the ecosystem quickly returned to balance after a short period of self regulation 4 2 ecological response to hydrological regime changes hydrological fluctuations under natural conditions are essential processes for maintaining lake ecological diversity and ecosystem health according to our assessment of the ecological response of dtl after the dam s construction the si of flow and water level decreased by 9 and 8 compared to the pre dam period respectively we further discussed the ecological response process of wetland suitability to dtl habitat fish and birds under the change of ecohydrological regime in terms of habitat the water quality of dtl has a deteriorating trend after the operation of the tgd the total nitrogen content has a significant upward trend and the total phosphorus content has a downward trend geng et al 2021a 2021b meanwhile the way wetlands covered dtl over the past 40 years 1978 2018 has changed since the operation of the tgd transitional areas of water and vegetation mudflats decreased vegetation area changed from an annual increase of 44 22 km2 to an annual decrease of 26 36 km2 and water area changed from an annual reduction of 37 23 km2 to an annual increase of 20 05 km2 yang et al 2020 changes in hydrological regime in the dtl basin resulted in the loss of fish habitat and changes in fish community structure resulting in a decline in fish diversity and individual miniaturization ru et al 2008 currently there are signs of an increase in the proportion of omnivorous fish and a decrease in the ratio of predatory and semi migratory fish in the dtl basin zhu et al 2014 the way that the hydrological situation affects the birds is to change the water and sand process to affect the bird s habitat quality which in turn affects the bird s habitat selection and feeding strategy huang et al 2019 about 80 of the migratory birds are concentrated in the east dtl like to concentrate around the lake water depth human disturbance and vegetation coverage are the key variables that affect the distribution of migratory birds zou et al 2019 the decrease of mudflat area fragmentation and water area in east dtl resulted in reducing the number of hooded crane white crane grey crane and white naped crane zhou et al 2019 under strong disturbance the ecological response process of dtl fluctuated greatly and the ecological system s structural stability and functional integrity were damaged the change degree of 31 ecohydrological indicators iha in 5 groups of dtl wetland also proved this conclusion every year from april to may the tgd releases water and the water level in the three gorges is progressively dropped to 145 m during the flood season before the water rises causing the water level in the downstream dtl to rise at the same time fig 4 flows in may and water levels in july and september tgd impoundment both reached high changes fig 7 and these changes affected water column photosynthesis including the lag effect of upstream reservoirs on water temperature it will bring negative benefits to the temperature and oxygen level of dtl thereby indirectly affecting the primary productivity the annual average extreme value and duration of runoff remained at a low change indicating that the channel morphology and physical habitat conditions of the dtl wetland remained relatively good under natural conditions the behavior of fish and other organisms entering special habitats to avoid predation during reproduction is closely related to the occurrence time of the extreme value of flow and water level moderate changes in the frequency of changes in flow and water levels rising caused some low elevation islands in the dtl wetlands to be submerged trapping the native organisms on the islands and subjecting them to extinction 5 conclusion in this study we conducted a quantitative assessment of the ecohydrology process of dtl and analyzed the diversified driving forces of the process the operation of the tgd not only reduced the composition of efcs in dtl but also changed various ecohydrological indicators of flow and water level the overall changes in flow and water level were 37 and 36 respectively the alterations in groups 1 monthly variation 2 annual average extreme value and duration and 3 occurrence time of annual extreme condition had a negative influence on dtl s species richness and habitat quality we also quantitatively differentiated the contribution of climate components precipitation and evaporation to changes in dtl runoff and water level and found that runoff and water level showed strong sensitivities to rainfall and human activities respectively among them the contribution of human activities to water level changes is 10 68 larger than that of runoff changes the contribution of rainfall to water level changes is 11 1 smaller than that of runoff changes and the contribution of evaporation to both is only 0 42 different the change of underlying surface parameters n in multiple periods shows that the influence weight of climate change on runoff pre and post construction of tgd has maintained an upward trend human activities and climate change are complicated issues and studying their influence on flow and water levels is a long term topic our research methodology could serve as a reference for assessing ecohydrological changes in other watersheds moreover our results could provide suitable insights for researchers and decision makers when developing an ecological restoration planning frameworks in dlt however to assess the flow and water level we used ecological indicators with a wide range of applicability in the future how to precisely choose relevant and easy to use ecological indicators for the dtl ecosystem will be the key to further research credit authorship contribution statement hongxiang wang conceptualization lintong huang formal analysis writing original draft writing review and

this study is to use ecologically meaningful indicators environmental flow components method and range of variability approach method to evaluate the dynamic process of flow and water level components whose changes have a negative impact on the dtl wetland ecosystem in addition we quantitatively expressed the ecological response process of flow and water level under changing environments and proposed to use the underlying surface parameters to further clarify the impact of human activities and climate change evaporation and rainfall on runoff in different time periods new hydrological insights for the region after the construction of the three gorges dam the components of environmental flow in dtl were reduced and the overall change of the flow and water level of the dtl was 37 and 36 respectively the results of the wetland ecological response coincided with the trend of habitat fragmentation and miniaturization of fish individuals in dtl the underlying surface parameters show that the weight of the impact of climate change on runoff is increasing and the contribution rate of driving forces human activities evaporation and rainfall to runoff are 49 32 20 88 and 29 80 respectively and to water levels are 60 00 21 3 and 18 7 respectively keywords ecohydrology hydrological regime ecological response flow and water level dongting lake 1 introduction the natural and reasonable fluctuation of wetland hydrological process is one of the important driving forces to maintain the wetland hydrological environment and its biodiversity ecohydrological regime is the coupling process between biological and hydrological process fan et al 2014 gabiri et al 2018 quantitative assessment of wetland ecohydrology regimes is a prerequisite for understanding the health status of wetland ecosystem finding a management paradigm for sustainable regulation of wetland water resources and comprehensively improving the service function of wetland ecosystem zhang et al 2016 for lake wetlands flow and water level relationships are the focus of consideration in hydrology habitat relationship studies through the qualitative and quantitative description of the relationship between the hydrological regime indicators and the ecological indicators the response law of the ecosystem to different hydrological regimes can be obtained the hydrological regime change mechanism and ecological response process of wetlands in changing environments are complex and diverse in the change of hydrological regimes the runoff water level directly acts on the vertical and horizontal structure of the wetland ecosystem therefore clarifying the contribution of different factors to the change of runoff and water level is an essential link for the in depth understanding of the interaction mechanism between wetland ecology and hydrology and wetland ecohydrology assessment liu et al 2020 human activities and climate change are important factors affecting the hydrological regime changes of wetlands however at present most studies analyze the impact of runoff and water level on the study area separately and also no detailed classification of climatic factors there as one of the 200 critical ecological regions globally dongting lake dtl wetland plays a vital role in water conservation regional climate regulation and biodiversity maintenance at the same time dtl wetland is an essential support for the sustainable economic development of hunan province china geng et al 2020 salimi et al 2021 the ecohydrological processes of dtl change due to human activities and climate change thus having an impact on the ecosystem cyclical changes in runoff and water levels for example are reducing the dtl habitat area dong and zhang 2011 zhu et al 2021 yu et al 2018 found that the changes of water sediment in dtl from 1951 to 2014 could be divided into four main phases under the influence of the three factors of jingjiang cutoffs jc gezhou dam gd and three gorges dam tgd the water sediment is decreasing step by step the factors affecting the water level change in the dtl basin are different from water sediment compared with water sediment affected by many factors the factors affecting water level change can be divided into two categories the first category is the direct influence of the hydrological regime of the mainstream of the yangtze river the second category is the joint influence of the runoff into the lake and the mainstream of the yangtze river cheng et al 2017 some scholars quantitatively evaluated the change degree of the above hydrological regimes for example wang et al 2021 used the indicators of hydrological alteration range of variability approach iha rva method to assess the daily water level of dtl from 1959 to 2016 the water level from 1959 to 2002 is the natural water level series and from 2003 to 2016 is the post anthropogenic influence series the change of water level in dtl was 50 yu et al 2020 used eight methods for attribution analysis of runoff changes in dtl they found that climate change played a dominant role in runoff changes during 1984 2004 and human activities played a dominant role in runoff changes during 2005 2019 using 1961 1983 as the base period therefore we conducted a quantitative assessment of changes in the flow and water level of dtl using ecological indicators and shannon index to reflect ecological response processes under variability in the ecohydrological regimes of dtl took 2003 as the changing point the budyko coupled water energy balance theory and the slope change ratio of accumulative quantity method were used to clarify the contribution rate of anthropogenic disturbance and important components of climate precipitation and evaporation to the runoff and the water level and to quantitatively analyze the specific change process of the underlying surface of dtl wetland the results of this research will be a valuable reference for objectively understanding the driving forces in dtl and the results will provide guidance to the decision maker on regional ecological restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dtl 111 14 113 10 e 28 30 30 23 n is not only the second largest freshwater lake in china but also the natural storage lake of the yangtze river fig 1 the area of dtl was reduced from 6 000 km2 before 1825 to 2 651 km2 in 1999 the water level of chenglingji hydrographic stations was 33 5 m it frequently exchanges with the river water of the yangtze river and the water exchange frequency is short about 18 2 d the lake area is located in the climate zone of transition from the central subtropics to the northern subtropics with an annual average temperature of 16 4 17 0 an average temperature of 4 0 4 5 in january and an average temperature of 29 0 in july the precipitation in the basin is ample and concentrated and the precipitation varies significantly from year to year the average annual precipitation is 1 100 mm to 1 400 mm and the rainfall from april to june accounts for more than 50 of the total precipitation in the whole year creeks on the outer edge of dtl are intertwined small lakes dotted embankment vertical and horizontal 2 2 data preparation the data of runoff water sediment and water level in this study are derived from the yangtze river water conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources of

selected from the meteorological stations of yueyang nanxian changde and yuanjiang in the dtl basin all from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend free pre whitening mann kendall test tfpw mk the mann kendall mk trend test method is often used to test the trend of long time series which has the advantage of being independent of outliers and does not require satisfying a specific probability distribution jiang et al 2020 however this method is affected by the autocorrelation of data itself and needs improvement in this study the trend free pre whitening tfpw test was used to improve it zhang et al 2013 the specific calculation steps of tfpw mk method are as follows 1 β median x j x i j i 2 y t x t t t x t β t 3 y t y t r 1 y t 1 4 y t y t t

s var s we use the bilateral test at the α significant indigenous level if z mk z 1 α 2 the sequence rejects the original hypothesis of no trend the sequence has an increasing or decreasing trend conversely the sequence has no increasing or decreasing trend 2 3 2 environmental flow components efcs environmental flow components efcs are the flow and process needed to maintain the river s ecological environment it is composed of five flow events low flows 1 12 extreme low flows 13 16 high flow pulses 17 22 small floods 23 28 and large floods 29 34 with a total of 34 indicators as shown in table 1 the threshold division of related flow events are defined in the reference richter and thomas 2007 the coefficient of dispersion c d reflects the deviation degree of each index from the mean value and the deviation factor f d represents the deviation of each index value from the reference period before and after anthropogenic disturbance eappen et al 2020 which is calculated according to the following formula 8 c d h l m 9 f d d pre d post d pre where l m and h are the 25th percentile 50th percentile and 75th percentile of each hydrological sequence before and after the disturbance of anthropogenic disturbance d pre and d post represent the values of efcs indexes before and after anthropogenic disturbance respectively 2 3 3 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha richter et al 1996 proposed the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha to reflect the hydrological regime of rivers including indicators from four aspects flow event frequency and change rate as shown in table 2 2 3 4 range of variability approach rva richter et al 1997 proposed the range of variability approach rva method based on the iha to evaluate changes in the hydrological regime the degree of change d i for a single hydrological indicator is calculated as follows 10 d i p o p e p e 100 where p 0 denotes the frequency at which the hydrological parameters fall within the target range of flow management after hydrological variation p e represents the expectation which refers to the range of ecohydrology target interval the expectation in this study is 50 d i is a positive value indicating that the parameters of the hydrological series after variation fall in the target interval higher than expected if d i is negative it means that the parameters of the variant hydrological series fall lower than expected in the target interval when d i 67 the variation of hydrological parameters are considered to be high h when 34 d i 67 it is considered that the change degree of hydrological parameters is medium m when d i 34 the change degree of hydrological parameters is low l an overall degree of hydrological alteration d o is defined as follows 11 d o 1 33 i 1 33 d i 2 0 5 2 3 5 evaluation of ecological diversity in addition we used the fluvial biodiversity shannon indexes si to represent the ecological response process under the change of hydrological regime in dtl it is a regression equation based on iha indicators and genetic programming method h yang et al 2008 y yang et al 2008 the calculation formula is as follows 12 s i d min m i n 7 d min w 3 w 5 m i n 3 2 m a x 3 r r a t e where d min represents the julian date of minimum water level w 3 and w 5 mean the average flows in march and may respectively min3 and min7 denote annual minimum 3 d and 7 d average flow respectively max3 is the maximum yearly 3 d average flow r rate is the rate of overflowing 2 3 6 budyko coupled water energy balance theory for the attribution analysis of runoff change we used the budyko coupled water energy balance theory the basin s long term water balance can be expressed as 13 r p e δ s where r means the average runoff depth mm p means average precipitation mm e represents the average actual evaporation mm δs is water storage change mm in the long time scale runoff change δs is 0 based on budyko hypothesis choudhury 1999 and y yang et al 2008 h yang et al 2008 combined with the empirical formula of annual evaporation and applied the methods of dimensional analysis and mathematical statistics to deduce the water balance equation at the annual average scale namely 14 r p p e t 0 p n e t 0 1 n where et 0 means potential evapotranspiration n as characteristic parameters of the watershed underlying surface since p et 0 and n are independent variables it is known that r p and et 0 can deduce n the sensitivity of r to various factors can be expressed by the elastic coefficient as follows 15 ε x r x x r where x can be expressed as p et a or n according to the elastic coefficient of runoff to each influencing factor the change amount caused by the influencing factor to the runoff depth can be obtained finally the total change amount of runoff depth δ r can be obtained by summing up which is expressed as follows 16 δ r δ r p δ r e t 0 δ r n the contribution rate of each factor to runoff change is calculated according to the following formula 17 η p δ r p δ r 100 η e t 0 δ r e t 0 δ r 100 η n δ r n δ r 100 2 3 7 slope change ratio of accumulative quantity scraq we used the slope change ratio of accumulative quantity method to analyze the attribution of water level change wang et al 2012 according to the budyko coupled water energy balance theory the difference runoff depth between rainfall and actual evaporation was used to replace the evolution of water level the contribution rates of precipitation p actual evaporation e and human activities are quantified respectively the specific calculation steps are as follows 18 w x s x post s x pre s x pre where x represents r p e respectively s pre and s post represents the slope of the mutation before and after respectively the contribution rate of each factor can be written as 19 c p w p w r 100 c e w e w r 100 c h u m a n 1 c p c e 3 results 3 1 evolution characteristics of flow and water level the interannual trend of annual average flow and water level at chenglingji hydrological station of dtl from 1984 to 2019 is displayed in fig 2 the consequence shows that the average yearly flow and water level alteration is synchronous catastrophic floods in 1988 and severe droughts in 2011 had more significant impacts on runoff according to tfpw mk test results fig 3 the annual average discharge and annual average water level from 1984 to 2019 showed increasing and decreasing trends respectively the flow showed a significant upward trend from 1992 to 2002 still none of them passed the significance test zannual average flow 0 142 zannual average water level 0 284 z α 0 05 1 96 analysis of variation trend of flow and water level in the year fig 4 shows that the peak value of flow in the wet period after the construction of tgd was significantly weakened the water level was still synchronized with the flow in the wet period and there was an upward trend in the dry season the maximum upward appreciation was 0 87 m in early march 3 2 evaluation of environmental flow components efcs after the dam s construction the flow peak value of the small floods event decreases fig 5 extremely low flow and water level events no longer occur the composition of efcs declines the operation of the tgd has a strong peak cutting effect on the annual flow and the water level and eventually leads to a narrow range of flow and water levels the quantitative assessment of flow and water level of efcs in dtl pre and post construction of the tgd show that the deviation coefficient of the low flow flow reached 27 32 and 24 in february october and november while the deviation coefficients were smaller in the remaining months fig 6 the average duration index and peak index of the extreme low flow flow are greatly affected by dam construction and their deviation coefficients reach 68 and 100 respectively the deviation coefficient of the peak index of the high flow pulse flow is equivalent to that of the average duration index of the small flood flow and the deviation coefficient of the decline rate index of the major flood flow reaches 100 as for the deviation coefficient of water level the fluctuation of the low flow water level deviation coefficient from january to december is inconspicuous the average duration deviation coefficient of the extreme low flow water level has changed by 76 which is much higher than the 30 55 of the average duration and rise rate of the high flow pulse water level and the small flood water level the large flood water level disappears due to dam construction so zero deviation coefficient in general the greatly affected events include the extreme low flow flow and water level and the large and small floods flow and water level 3 3 quantitative assessment of hydrological regime change table 3 and fig 7 show the change quantification results of 31 hydrological indicators in 5 groups of all iha indicators flow only the median flow in may reached a high level of change 75 with 13 moderate indicators accounting for 42 among the water level indicators the median water level variation grade in july and september reaches a height change 84 and 68 respectively moderately changed indicators accounted for 29 after the construction of the tgd the overall flow and water level indicators of dongting lake showed moderate changes which were 37 and 36 respectively in addition the commonality analysis of the hydrological change degree of the flow rate and the water level shows that there are 4 same indicators that have a greater degree of change flow in february 60 water level 44 flow in october 58 water level 52 the occurrence time of the annual minimum flow 60 the occurrence time of the annual minimum water level 52 the number of annual flow fluctuations 58 and the number of annual water level fluctuations 63 the natural hydrological regime flow and water level of the wetland is being changed which may have more negative impact than positive on the habitat quality of dtl 3 4 quantitative assessment of ecological response fig 8 depicts the interannual variability of the shannon index of flow and water level in dtl from 1984 to 2019 indicating the volatility of the ecological response mechanism in dtl as hydrological circumstances vary according to the results of tfpw mk method the standardized test statistic zflow 0 739 zwater level 0 055 z 1 96 critical value at α 0 05 for the si of flow and water level show that the si of flow and water level present a decreasing trend from 1984 to 2019 still they all cannot pass the significance testing average the si of flow reduced by 9 after dam construction compared to pre dam construction and the si of water level decreased by 8 the similarity between the two shows that the negative impact of the construction of the tgd on the ecological environment can not be overlooked 3 5 analysis of diversified driving forces the calculated results of the elastic coefficients of various factors are shown in table 4 according to the calculation results the change process of underlying surface parameter n under the influence of human activities is further analyzed fig 8 the underlying surface parameters n before and after dam construction are 1 50 and 1 94 according to the outcome analysis of the underlying surface parameters in multiple periods the underlying surface parameters have been declining before the construction of the tgd indicating that the impact of human activities on runoff is decreasing and the effect of climate change on runoff is increasing after the dam was built the underlying surface parameters n increased abruptly from period 4 1999 2003 to 5 2004 2008 then started to decrease gradually afterwards fig 9 indicating that although the impact of climate change on runoff is increasing the impact of human activities on runoff is still at a relatively high level human activities have visible stage characteristics from the distribution of underlying surface parameters during periods 1 1984 1988 5 2004 2008 and 6 2009 2013 human activities have the most significant impact on runoff and least influence in periods 3 1994 1998 and 4 1999 2003 precipitation accumulation evaporation accumulation and water level accumulation pre and post construction of the dam are linearly correlated with years fig 10 therefore it is reasonable to distinguish the impacts of human activities and climate change on the hydrological regime of dtl by using the slope change ratio of the accumulative quantity method the contribution rates of different factors to dtl runoff and water level changes are shown in fig 10 the sensitivity of runoff to rainfall changes is stronger than that of water level and the contribution rate of rainfall to runoff changes is 29 8 which is 11 1 larger than the contribution rate of water level changes the water level is more sensitive to human activities than runoff and the contribution rate of human activities to water level changes is 60 which is 10 68 larger than the contribution rate to runoff changes therefore human activity is an important factor in the change of hydrological regimes in dtl and the contribution of evaporation to runoff change and water level change is almost equal which is 20 88 and 21 3 respectively fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 ecohydrological regimes and their drivers in this study the ecohydrological regime variation of dtl is quantitatively analyzed in terms of the annual variation of flow and water level the characteristics of efcs and the degree of hydrological change we found that the changes in parameter characteristics duration occurrence time and frequency of efcs and iha for flow and water level remained similar after 2003 the duration and occurrence time in particular plays a central role in sustaining native biodiversity and is one of the most influential regulators offish life history strategies and community structure fox and magoulick 2019 the plant community composition and productivity were closely related to submergence duration time and inundation frequency deng et al 2013 therefore the reduction of the above mentioned ecohydrological parameters in dtl has brought negative benefits to the fish community structure and plant community productivity although the drivers that cause changes in the above ecohydrological characteristics are classified into climate change rainfall and evaporation and human activities they can still be further differentiated for example human activities can be classified as dam operation land use change the operation of the tgd resulted in a decrease of 26 357 billion m3 17 228 billion m3 and 7 874 billion m3 in the annual runoff of in chenglingji jto and the four river respectively the contribution rates of jto and the four river to the inflow of dtl were 23 and 77 respectively our study confirmed that climate change precipitation and evaporation affects runoff and water level by 50 68 and 40 respectively and these findings support the conclusions of yuan et al 2016 but runoff is more sensitive to climate change and water levels are more sensitive to human activity the water level in dtl wetlands could regulate the hydrological environment and affect water conservation hu et al 2020 therefore on this basis the decision maker can use the sensitive characteristics of water level to human activities combined with the components in efcs flow and water level that are beneficial to habitat quality and conduct appropriate artificial regulation through reservoir group adjust the rising duration and falling speed of the flood peak in a timely manner to slow down the impact on aquatic organisms in addition the ecological environment of dtl wetlands was actually affected by human activities from 1984 to 1988 fig 9 but the fluctuations were not significant and the ecosystem quickly returned to balance after a short period of self regulation 4 2 ecological response to hydrological regime changes hydrological fluctuations under natural conditions are essential processes for maintaining lake ecological diversity and ecosystem health according to our assessment of the ecological response of dtl after the dam s construction the si of flow and water level decreased by 9 and 8 compared to the pre dam period respectively we further discussed the ecological response process of wetland suitability to dtl habitat fish and birds under the change of ecohydrological regime in terms of habitat the water quality of dtl has a deteriorating trend after the operation of the tgd the total nitrogen content has a significant upward trend and the total phosphorus content has a downward trend geng et al 2021a 2021b meanwhile the way wetlands covered dtl over the past 40 years 1978 2018 has changed since the operation of the tgd transitional areas of water and vegetation mudflats decreased vegetation area changed from an annual increase of 44 22 km2 to an annual decrease of 26 36 km2 and water area changed from an annual reduction of 37 23 km2 to an annual increase of 20 05 km2 yang et al 2020 changes in hydrological regime in the dtl basin resulted in the loss of fish habitat and changes in fish community structure resulting in a decline in fish diversity and individual miniaturization ru et al 2008 currently there are signs of an increase in the proportion of omnivorous fish and a decrease in the ratio of predatory and semi migratory fish in the dtl basin zhu et al 2014 the way that the hydrological situation affects the birds is to change the water and sand process to affect the bird s habitat quality which in turn affects the bird s habitat selection and feeding strategy huang et al 2019 about 80 of the migratory birds are concentrated in the east dtl like to concentrate around the lake water depth human disturbance and vegetation coverage are the key variables that affect the distribution of migratory birds zou et al 2019 the decrease of mudflat area fragmentation and water area in east dtl resulted in reducing the number of hooded crane white crane grey crane and white naped crane zhou et al 2019 under strong disturbance the ecological response process of dtl fluctuated greatly and the ecological system s structural stability and functional integrity were damaged the change degree of 31 ecohydrological indicators iha in 5 groups of dtl wetland also proved this conclusion every year from april to may the tgd releases water and the water level in the three gorges is progressively dropped to 145 m during the flood season before the water rises causing the water level in the downstream dtl to rise at the same time fig 4 flows in may and water levels in july and september tgd impoundment both reached high changes fig 7 and these changes affected water column photosynthesis including the lag effect of upstream reservoirs on water temperature it will bring negative benefits to the temperature and oxygen level of dtl thereby indirectly affecting the primary productivity the annual average extreme value and duration of runoff remained at a low change indicating that the channel morphology and physical habitat conditions of the dtl wetland remained relatively good under natural conditions the behavior of fish and other organisms entering special habitats to avoid predation during reproduction is closely related to the occurrence time of the extreme value of flow and water level moderate changes in the frequency of changes in flow and water levels rising caused some low elevation islands in the dtl wetlands to be submerged trapping the native organisms on the islands and subjecting them to extinction 5 conclusion in this study we conducted a quantitative assessment of the ecohydrology process of dtl and analyzed the diversified driving forces of the process the operation of the tgd not only reduced the composition of efcs in dtl but also changed various ecohydrological indicators of flow and water level the overall changes in flow and water level were 37 and 36 respectively the alterations in groups 1 monthly variation 2 annual average extreme value and duration and 3 occurrence time of annual extreme condition had a negative influence on dtl s species richness and habitat quality we also quantitatively differentiated the contribution of climate components precipitation and evaporation to changes in dtl runoff and water level and found that runoff and water level showed strong sensitivities to rainfall and human activities respectively among them the contribution of human activities to water level changes is 10 68 larger than that of runoff changes the contribution of rainfall to water level changes is 11 1 smaller than that of runoff changes and the contribution of evaporation to both is only 0 42 different the change of underlying surface parameters n in multiple periods shows that the influence weight of climate change on runoff pre and post construction of tgd has maintained an upward trend human activities and climate change are complicated issues and studying their influence on flow and water levels is a long term topic our research methodology could serve as a reference for assessing ecohydrological changes in other watersheds moreover our results could provide suitable insights for researchers and decision makers when developing an ecological restoration planning frameworks in dlt however to assess the flow and water level we used ecological indicators with a wide range of applicability in the future how to precisely choose relevant and easy to use ecological indicators for the dtl ecosystem will be the key to further research credit authorship contribution statement hongxiang wang conceptualization lintong huang formal analysis writing original draft writing review and

7953,study region a riparian zone within the songhua river basin in northeast china characterized by a continental monsoon semi humid climate study focus river infiltration is an important part of groundwater recharge at riverbank filtration rbf sites and largely depends on the riverbed hydraulic conductivity rhc the influence of river scouring and deposition on rhc is not completely clear resulting in calculation inaccuracies in the rate of river water infiltration to the aquifer thus the study determined the relationship between rhc and sediment particle size using stepwise regression analysis and a genetic algorithm a hydrodynamic and sediment transport model delft3d was used to simulate the spatial distribution of sediment particle sizes a numerical groundwater flow model was also established using visual modflow in which the river boundary was generalized into a third type of boundary condition and rhc zoning was performed to improve the accuracy of the simulation new hydrological insights the findings showed that accurate prediction of rhc is essential for the assessment of groundwater resources in riparian zones this is crucial for rbf managers as they will be

considering the non equilibrium characteristics of sediment transport particularly under unsteady flow conditions the traditional sediment transport modeling approach has been gradually improved and altered to include non equilibrium behavior armanini and di silvio 1988 rahuel et al 1989 wu et al 2000 meeting the needs of engineering practices many newly developed models can simulate the transport of non cohesive and cohesive sediments local river channel scouring and channel widening and winding among others commercial and non commercial simulation softwares for hydrodynamics and

evolution salty tide uptrends environmental assessments waterway regulation flood evolution among others hu et al 2009 ramos et al 2019 waldman et al 2017 in general current research on changes in rhc during the scouring and deposition processes is mainly based on the theoretical understanding of field measurements and laboratory experiments ghysels et al 2018 newcomer et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 however few studies have focused on the relationship between spatiotemporal changes in rhc and river hydrodynamics arntzen et al 2006 this has led to inaccurate evaluations of groundwater recharge by surface water infiltration in an rbf system which limits the reasonable exploitation planning for groundwater resources in riparian zones nevertheless uncertainties in the interaction of surface water and groundwater were explored rassam et al 2013 however to the best of our knowledge when groundwater extraction results in the transformation of a gaining stream into a losing stream the effects of riverbed hydraulic conductivity on surface water groundwater exchange fluxes and groundwater flow modeling still remain largely unexplored the main objective of our study is to evaluate the aquifer exploitation potential at an rbf site by combining groundwater flow with sediment transport modeling our modeling approach specifically accounts for variations in riverbed hydraulic conductivity by using information from the distribution of riverbed sediment in particular to our knowledge this study is the first to use sediment transport modeling to generate spatially distributed rhc fields based on simulated grain size distributions additionally we were able to improve model simulation accuracy by generalizing how the river boundary is integrated into the groundwater flow model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we focused on an rbf site within the riparian zone located adjacent to the second songhua river in jilin province northeastern china at geographical coordinates 125 52 00 125 54 20 e 44 47 00 44 48 40 n fig 1 it covered an area of 4 71 km2 and provided cooling water for a corn deep processing plant the river is approximately 3200 m long and 500 m wide in the studied river section its average depth is 2 5 m and the riverbed sediment is mainly medium fine sand according to observational data collected at the songhua river hydrological station from 2007 to 2010 the average annual runoff is 156 108 m3 year and the average suspended load content is 0 051 kg m3 during the dry season and 0 115 kg m3 during the flood season major floods mostly occur in july august and september accounting for 60 70 of the total annual runoff riverbed sediments and bed topography have been discussed and analyzed in our previous work cui et al 2021 the strata in the study area are mainly composed of quaternary loose accumulation layers and cretaceous clastic rocks the quaternary strata are widely distributed without bedrock exposure the groundwater in the study area is mainly stored in a shallow unconfined aquifer in the quaternary sand and gravel layer with a thickness of 15 25 m it is the main target layer of the groundwater source and characterized by a binary structure with thin top and thick bottom and relatively high hydraulic conductivity fig 1 2 2 establishment of groundwater flow model a numerical model for groundwater flow at the rbf site was established eq 1 using the visual modflow vmod software version 4 2 waterloo hydrogeologic inc 2006 based on modflow 2005 which was originally developed by united states geological survey 1 x k h b h

km2 was equally divided into 120 rows and 140 columns with a total of 8350 effective grid cells each with an area of 560 m2 the medium in the study area was generalized as a single layer isotropic two dimensional unsteady flow aquifer with a thickness of 16 23 m the eastern boundary was generalized as a river boundary and the other boundaries were generalized as given head boundaries owing to the installation of observation wells fig s1 the simulation period extended from april to december 2016 with a total of eight stress periods and the time step for each stress period was one month the model identification period extended from april to august 2016 and the model validation period extended from august to december 2016 for the input data we applied the evt package and the river package the elevation data were obtained through field measurement of 400 points river stage and discharge data were collected from a nearby hydrological station songhuajiang station head data for a given head boundary were derived from monthly groundwater table measurements at the observation wells during the simulation period https doi pangaea de 10 1594 pangaea 937172 the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the aquifer were obtained through a pumping test table s1 precipitation and evapotranspiration data were obtained from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the groundwater extraction volumes were obtained from the corn deep processing plant and rhc was determined within the range of empirical values based on the riverbed sediment particle size table s1 the observed data were used to calculate the change in groundwater storage using eq 2 the product was then compared with the model simulation results to determine the error rate of model simulation under different boundary approaches 2 q μ f h where q is the change in groundwater storage μ is the specific yield of the aquifer dimensionless f is the study area m2 and h is the change in the groundwater table m positive value when rising negative value when falling 2 3 sensitivity analysis to improve the simulation accuracy of the vmod model and reduce the error caused by the uncertainty of the model parameters parameter sensitivity analysis of the groundwater flow numerical model was performed the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k specific yield μ rhc and recharge coefficient of precipitation α were selected as the main parameters for sensitivity analysis the parameters were increased and decreased by 10 20 and 30 when one parameter was changed the other parameters remained unchanged and the average change in the groundwater table in the observation well was used as a reference for sensitivity analysis 2 4 generalization of the river boundary in vmod the wide shallow river did not completely cut the aquifer which indicates that the bottom elevation of the river was higher than that of the aquifer in the northeastern part of the simulation area thus the river was generalized using the third type of boundary condition the interaction between the surface water and groundwater river leakage or groundwater recharge was generalized as a one dimensional vertical flow which was calculated using eq 3 in the river sub routine of the model 3 q r g b l k m h r h s where q r g is the amount of river water recharge or discharge to groundwater m3 d k m is the riverbed hydraulic conductivity m d b is the width of the river m l is the river length m h r is the river stage m h is the groundwater table m and s is the riverbed sediment thickness according to the observed data of the initial field investigation the particle size of the riverbed deeper than 50 cm is relatively stable while the particle size of the riverbed shallower than 50 cm changes greatly which has a significant impact on the rhc therefore s was set as 0 5 m in this study m to consider the effects of rhc on the results of the model the river boundary was addressed in different approaches fig s1 1 as a linear boundary given the average width bottom elevation and thickness of the riverbed and a homogenous empirical value for vertical rhc and 2 as a polygon boundary divided into different zones the vertical rhc riverbed bottom elevation and riverbed sediment thickness changed over time monthly zonation of the parameters that changed over time in the second approach was input to the polygon river boundary it was continuously iterated to the next month after calculation or simulation based on the delft3d model zone division of the polygon river boundary in the vmod model was performed manually we divided the riverbed into different zones according to the riverbed morphology main troughs sandbanks shoals and deep troughs thus river hydrodynamic conditions and rhc values were similar within each zone then the particle size data simulated by the delft3d model were used to calculate the rhc of each zone according to the rhc calculation formula obtained by the genetic algorithm ga method the rhc value of each zone is the average value of all sampling points within the zone the average value in each zone was then assigned to the vmod model 2 5 quantitative estimation of rhc stepwise regression analysis sra is used to reduce the degree of multi collinearity by eliminating variables that are the least important and highly related to other variables jennrich and sampson 1968 kabe 1963 the variables are introduced in the model one by one and an f test is performed after each explanatory variable is introduced the selected explanatory variables are tested one by one using a student s t test when the original explanatory variable is no longer significant owing to the introduction of a later explanatory variable it is deleted to ensure that only significant variables are included in the regression equation before introducing a new variable this is an iterative process wherein the final set of explanatory variables can be guaranteed to be optimal until neither significant explanatory variables are selected for the regression equation nor all insignificant explanatory variables are removed from the regression equation based on previous studies d10 d30 d50 d60 d90 cc cu are important physical characteristics to calculate hydraulic conductivity using grain size distribution in empirical equations odong 2007 additionally water depth and flow velocity often affect the distribution of sediment particles therefore in this study nine explanatory variables including d10 d30 d50 d60 d90 cc cu water depth and flow velocity were selected and sra were used to eliminate the highly interdependent multi collinear variables using spss software the selected explanatory variables are shown in the results section section 3 4 ga is a computational model that simulates the biological process of natural selection and the genetic mechanism of darwinian biological evolution theory the method determines the optimal solution by simulating a natural evolution process ga encodes the group of parameters to be calculated and uses the population to describe the parameter intervals mirjalili 2019 a set of optimal parameters is obtained through continuous selection crossover and mutation by adopting a probabilistic optimization method gobeyn et al 2017 zhang and xin 2017 in this study nsga ii was used to fit and quantitatively estimate the relationship between rhc and its main controlling parameters derived from the sra and thus obtain a quantitative formula for rhc the model fitted the mathematical relationship based on the observed data and determined the best fitting result was selected for the further analysis r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate the fitting effect the closer their values are to 1 the more accurate is the mathematical relationship 2 6 sediment sampling and water depth measurement eighteen sampling points numbered s1 s18 were arranged from both banks to the river center forming five cross sections from upstream to downstream and one longitudinal section along the main channel fig 2 the bed sediments were collected using a beeker sampler lm30 04 23 sa netherlands with a sampling depth range of 0 50 cm below the riverbed in may dry period july flood period and november discharge recession period in 2016 the sediments were then placed in pvc tubes or polymethyl methacrylate columns for analysis a total of 60 measurement points were arranged within the riverbed to measure the water depth using a homemade sounding weight and leveling device made of a 20 m long measuring rope and an 5 kg lead weight when the sounding weight sank to the bottom of the river the tick mark on the tight rope at the water s surface was read as the water depth dense measurements were obtained using a leveling instrument in locations where the topography fluctuated widely e g land areas such as sandbanks and beaches a constant head permeability test fig s2 and particle size analyses using the sieving method were conducted in the laboratory to determine the hydraulic conductivities d10 d30 d50 d60 d90 the coefficient of curvature cc and the coefficient of uniformity cu of the riverbed sediment moreover the water depth and velocity at each sampling point were measured using a sounding weight and a current meter fp211 global water usa the riverbed sediment samples were collected from the river using a beeker sampler and were directly loaded into darcy experimental columns with the same diameter 11 cm filling the column in the field minimizes the disturbance to the sediment sample allowing the initial layering to remain intact the rhc was then calculated using the following equation 4 k m ql h 1 h 2 a where k m is the rhc m d q is the flow rate m3 s h 1 and h 2 indicate the water head before and after passing through the sediment sample respectively m l is the length of the riverbed sediment sample along the flow direction m and a is the cross sectional area of the experimental column m2 2 7 prediction of the variable boundary conditions river stage river discharge and precipitation are important variable boundary conditions in the delft3d and vmod models in dry wet and normal years the hydrological frequency analysis method was used to predict the river stage and river discharge according to the statistical data of the river discharge we analyzed the quantitative relationship between the river discharge data from 2006 to 2017 and the frequency of occurrence according to table 1 the hydrological years were classified as dry wet and normal the discharge data of each hydrological year can be obtained according to the hydrologic frequency analysis moreover the historical river stage and river discharge in the study area showed a good correlation therefore river stage data that need to be input to the boundary in the delft3d or vmod model can be derived from the stage discharge correlation under different hydrological years table s2 hydrological conditions largely depend on atmospheric precipitation we chose the three years with measured discharge data closest to those of the three design frequencies namely 2014 for a wet year 2006 for a normal year and 2009 for a dry year the precipitation data of these three years were input to the vmod model as variable conditions for scenarios of wet normal and dry years 2 8 simulation and prediction of rhc based on the flow continuity equation horizontal momentum equation vertical velocity equation and three dimensional advection diffusion mass balance equation for suspended sediment an open source delft3d model was used to simulate and predict the temporal and spatial changes in the riverbed topography and the characteristic particle sizes of the riverbed sediments based on the particle size data temporal and spatial distributions of rhc were calculated using the quantitative formula mentioned in section 2 6 fig s3 this analysis provided the parameter basis for evaluating and predicting the groundwater resource quantity in this model we used the finite difference method dividing the riverbed in the study area into 1480 grid cells of 20 74 with minimum and maximum grid lengths of 2 m and 30 m respectively the simulation period extended from march 2016 to march 2017 the initial riverbed topography was interpolated according to the water depth data collected at 60 measurement points the daily river stage discharge and sediment concentration in the input data were obtained from hydrological stations located in the upper and lower reaches of the study area the upstream entrance boundary of the simulation area was a total discharge boundary whereas the downstream outlet boundary was a water level boundary the incoming and outgoing sediment conditions were set at the upper and lower boundaries the time step calculated by the model was 0 1 min combined with the distributions of riverbed sediment particle sizes and actual sediment transport the initial sediment load was set into four components table s3 the mud in component 1 was a wash load the sand in components 2 3 and 4 was a bed material load the thickness of the migration layer and the lower layer were set to 0 5 m and 2 m respectively based on the predicted river stage river discharge regional precipitation and rhc the groundwater exploitation potential under different hydrological years was predicted using the established groundwater flow numerical model 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation the parameter sensitivity analysis of the vmod model is shown in table 2 average groundwater table change is inversely proportional to the change in specific yield and directly proportional to the change in other parameters the influence of rhc on the model is much greater than that of other parameters therefore to improve simulation accuracy it is necessary to improve the accuracy of rhc input values in the calibration process when the river boundary was treated as a linear boundary the calibrated parameter values in the vmod model were determined as shown in table s3 under the best fitting effect of the vmod and delft3d model the simulated and observed values of the groundwater table in the observation well sediment particle size and riverbed elevation were fitted as shown in fig 3 3 2 riverbed sediment particle sizes and rhc based on the observed data of sediment particle size of 18 sampling points table s4 the validation of the delft3d model showed that the model was reliable for the simulation and prediction of sediment particle size and bed topography based on the simulation results of the delft3d model the evolution of the effective particle size d10 of the riverbed sediment is shown in fig s4 after the inflow process from the end of may to the beginning of june the d10 of the main channel sediment reached a maximum value of 0 22 mm owing to continuous scouring of the river s main channel under strong hydrodynamic conditions in other parts of the riverbed this value varied by an order of magnitude over time indicating that the main channel sediments were constantly moving owing to suspension saltation and traction the evolution of the d50 of riverbed sediment particles is shown in fig s5 the spatial distribution of d50 was characterized by a main channel larger than both its sides after the inflow process from the end of may to the beginning of june the sediment d50 on the left side of the sandbar and the beach in the middle river gradually increased from 0 25 mm to 0 35 mm and then stabilized indicating that the riverbed sediment was continuously washed away forming a deep groove and the particle size changed from fine to coarse 3 3 bed topography bed topography variation in the simulated river was the highest in may and june while the degree of topography variation decreased after july during the inflow process in may and june the beaches and sandbanks on the left and right sides of the riverbed were partially or completely submerged after the river stage rose then the edges near the main groove were partially washed away and the range was smaller than that before the inflow process fig 4 from the upstream to downstream regions the elevation of the riverbed in the main channel initially fluctuated sharply at 600 m and 1750 m fig 5 downstream from the entrance section during the simulation period scouring and deposition conditions changed over time the riverbed in the upstream area 0 800 m mainly exhibited scouring with a scouring thickness of up to 2 m from 800 2000 m the riverbed experienced alternating scouring and deposition conditions and the beach slowly moved downstream at 2000 m the effect of deposition on the riverbed was the strongest with a deposition thickness of up to 3 m the highest deposition rate occurred during the wet season may and june 3 4 estimation of rhc two regression models were obtained from the sra after two explanatory variables in the order of d10 and d50 were introduced and seven variables were eliminated this indicates that the linear regression model established using independent and dependent variables has enhanced statistical significance model b presented a better fit than model a table s5 in particular the multiple correlation coefficient of model b was greater than that of model a we concluded that the two independent variables d10 and d50 were the most important factors affecting changes in rhc table s6 the relationships between the independent variables d10 and d50 and the dependent variable rhc were quantitatively estimated and optimized using the ga yielding a quantitative estimation formula as follows eq 4 5 k 2287 8 d 10 2 2 18 d 50 3 the goodness of fit coefficient of determination r2 and nse were selected to evaluate the fitting and optimization effect of the estimation formula fig 6 in general the closer the nse is to 1 the better is the simulation accuracy of the model the values of r2 and nse were 0 96 and 0 95 respectively indicating that the quantitative estimation of rhc obtained using this formula was reliable 3 5 zone division of rhc as the attributes of riverbed sediments alter periodically within the year the rhc of normal wet and dry years were estimated based on the predicted riverbed sediment particle sizes and quantitative estimation formula of rhc subsequently rhc was partitioned into zones and assigned monthly values notably changes in rhc mainly occurred in april june august and november figs s6 s8 in which 0 m d represents a sandbar that is not submerged or a zone with an extremely low rhc at the edge of the riverbank 3 6 groundwater balance analysis the results of a groundwater balance analysis in the simulation area for the linear and polygon river boundary conditions using vmod are presented in table 3 groundwater is mainly recharged by river leakage lateral inflow and precipitation infiltration for the two river boundary conditions linear and polygon boundaries the total groundwater recharge amounts in the study area were 11 577 0 m3 d and 14 161 4 m3 d respectively while river leakage accounted for 49 5 and 63 1 of the total recharge respectively however groundwater is mainly discharged by direct groundwater evaporation from aquifer groundwater pumping and lateral inflow the total groundwater discharge amounts were 9820 4 m3 d and 12 131 4 m3 d and base flow accounted for 0 02 and 3 5 of the total amount respectively the simulation area was generally in a positive equilibrium state and the storage changes were 1756 6 m3 d and 2030 0 m3 d respectively indicating that the aquifer in the study area still has exploitation potential 3 7 prediction of groundwater exploitation potential at present the total groundwater pumping rate at the rbf site is far below the designed rate and the groundwater volume is in a positive equilibrium state indicating that the scale of groundwater exploitation can still be expanded therefore the groundwater exploitation potential must be evaluated the average thickness of the aquifer at the rbf site is 21 m using 1 3 of the thickness of the aquifer 7 m as the maximum allowable groundwater drawdown within the cone of groundwater depression except the location within the pumping well s radius of influence the groundwater table dynamics in the next 5 years under different pumping schemes can be predicted the prediction could be used to determine the relationship between the pumping rate and the maximum drawdown of the groundwater depression cone which facilitates the determination of the groundwater exploitation potential of the aquifer the groundwater in the rbf is currently pumped intermittently through 16 wells with a pumping rate of 5900 m3 d the average single well pumping rate is 368 8 m3 d which is far below the designed rate 2400 3000 m3 d thus to increase the total pumping rate there is no need to increase the number of pumping wells instead only the pumping rate of the existing single wells should be increased six different pumping schemes were set by multiplying the current total pumping rate by 2 7 times table s7 for the six pumping schemes the groundwater table at the center of the groundwater depression cone continued to decline under conditions of continuous wet normal and dry years and stabilized after one year the maximum drawdown of the cone increased with the pumping rate exhibiting a good positive linear correlation fig 7 according to the fit relationship between the pumping rate and maximum drawdown the maximum exploitation potentials of the rbf site aquifer for continuous wet normal and dry years were calculated as 41 200 m3 d 39 000 m3 d and 31 100 m3 d respectively when the actual drawdown of the cone center reached the allowable drawdown 7 m the simulated groundwater hydraulic heads in the three conditions are shown in fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 influence of spatiotemporal variations in rhc rhc may not be the most sensitive parameter in many groundwater simulation studies however the river leakage caused by the exploitation of groundwater in the riparian zone is a relatively important groundwater recharge parameter which is affected by rhc the sensitivity of rhc is then highlighted therefore more accurate rhc data are needed when establishing groundwater flow models in riparian zones the variation range of the rhc simulated in this study is from 0 3 to 55 8 m d a relevant study have shown that rhc exhibits a meter scale spatial variation and both horizontal and vertical rhc vary over several orders of magnitude ghysels et al 2018 in another study the rhc ranged from 0 08 to 2 7 m d and were closely related to the grain size thickness and the clogging of the riverbed matusiak et al 2021 the polygon river boundary approach improved the simulation accuracy of the vmod model with r2 increased by nearly 0 04 fig 9 compared with the linear boundary approach fig 3d as shown in table 3 when considering the spatial and temporal changes in rhc during scouring and deposition the amount of river leakage and base flow increased significantly thereby affecting the amount of lateral inflow and evaporation in contrast without considering the spatial and temporal changes in rhc the river leakage was underestimated during the groundwater resource quantity calculation indicating that spatiotemporal changes in rhc under different hydrodynamic conditions have profound effects on river leakage fig 10 groundwater table monitoring data indicate that the groundwater table in the study area increased by an average of 0 85 m from april to december 2016 the change in groundwater storage was calculated using eq 2 the specific yield μ was determined to be 0 13 through a pumping test and f was 4 71 106 m2 therefore q was calculated as 5 20 105 m3 the calculated aquifer storage change results were 4 29 105 and 4 95 105 m3 respectively during the 244 day simulation period under the two river boundary conditions liner and polygon boundaries the error rates between the change in groundwater storage calculated from the monitoring data and the storage change calculated using the numerical model were 17 5 and 4 8 respectively this indicates that the model objectively reflects the actual hydrogeological conditions in the study area when considering the spatiotemporal changes in rhc during scouring and deposition 4 2 assumptions and limitations riverbeds are transient several studies have addressed this topic and suggested methods to observe and quantify these variations gianni et al 2016 partington et al 2017 tang et al 2018 in this study it was assumed that the river aquifer interface was isotropic continuous and saturated and that the shallow layer of the riverbed was dominated by vertical flow the presence of unsaturated zones at the river aquifer interface has large implications for numerous hydraulic and chemical processes estimation of the upper bound of the spatial extent of unsaturated areas beneath a riverbed can help inform the choice of a suitable numerical simulator for river aquifer systems schilling et al 2017 additionally future studies could look into the use of more advanced parameter optimization methods to determine model uncertainty or handle correlated interdependent decision variables during parameter estimation the use of grain size analysis to estimate hydraulic conductivity has certain limitations grain size based methods may sometimes overestimate vertical hydraulic conductivity brunner et al 2017 while in a lot of rivers with gravel beds grain size analysis is simply not a suitable method as one could barely capture the entire grain size distribution through field sampling and thus probably underestimating k chen 2000 pointed out that estimation of hydraulic conductivity by grain size analysis precludes the consideration of anisotropy additionally grain size analysis cannot consider preferential pathways and those can be important in riverbeds therefore based on the assumption of isotropic and vertical flow determining the most relevant particle parameters to rhc is the prerequisite for the application of the grain size based method anisotropy is critical for the river sediment system as we assumed vertical flow in the riverbed we did not evaluate the anisotropy however the assumption of isotropic conditions can significantly undermine the credibility of model predictions anisotropy is strongly suggested to be included as an additional calibration parameter ideally using transient observation of hydraulic heads gianni et al 2019 this study determined the exploitation potential of riparian groundwater based on site monitoring and model simulations from a macro perspective however the increase in river infiltration rates driven by groundwater extraction causes clogging within the sediments and aquifer involving physical chemical and biological processes battin and sengschmitt 1999 jin et al 2019 song et al 2020 these processes and mechanisms will be better understood with microscopic experiments in the laboratory yang et al 2021 the changes in the sediment structure of the river bed in this study were mainly affected by the physical processes driven by the hydrodynamics of the river water however the approach may no longer be applicable when biological or chemical processes in the riverbed sediment dominates the permeability of the riverbed sediment 4 3 implications for riparian ecology groundwater plays an important role in riparian ecosystems groundwater discharge is the driving force of riparian patterns in plant species composition jansson et al 2007 kibler et al 2021 meanwhile riparian vegetation typically has a great influence on groundwater level and groundwater sustained stream baseflow gribovszki et al 2008 the interaction and feedback between groundwater and vegetation in the riparian zone is usually balanced different vegetation species have their optimum groundwater table range the exploitation of groundwater in the riparian zone should fully consider the river leakage and predict the fluctuation range of the groundwater table to exploit the groundwater within the optimum range of groundwater fluctuation which will contribute to the health of the riparian ecosystem 5 conclusions strong spatiotemporal variability was observed in rhc controlled by hydrodynamic conditions when pumping groundwater in riparian zones the temporal and spatial variation of rhc has great influence on the quantity of groundwater resources according to monthly rhc simulations and calculation results the rhc was partitioned into zones and assigned a monthly value that can more accurately reflect the rhc spatiotemporal changes and improve groundwater simulation accuracy in the study area when considering the spatiotemporal variability of rhc the simulation accuracy of the groundwater resource can also be improved to a certain extent the exploitation of groundwater in riparian zones should fully consider river leakage the improvement of the simulation accuracy of groundwater model can improve the calculation accuracy of river leakage thereby avoiding the overestimation and underestimation of groundwater resources caused by changes in the permeability of riverbed sediments to a certain extent therefore this is crucial for rbf managers as they will be able to adjust the pumping rate according to the hydrological conditions of the river to either access higher quantities water resources in wet years or avoid a series of ecological and geological problems caused by excessive groundwater exploitation in dry

7953,study region a riparian zone within the songhua river basin in northeast china characterized by a continental monsoon semi humid climate study focus river infiltration is an important part of groundwater recharge at riverbank filtration rbf sites and largely depends on the riverbed hydraulic conductivity rhc the influence of river scouring and deposition on rhc is not completely clear resulting in calculation inaccuracies in the rate of river water infiltration to the aquifer thus the study determined the relationship between rhc and sediment particle size using stepwise regression analysis and a genetic algorithm a hydrodynamic and sediment transport model delft3d was used to simulate the spatial distribution of sediment particle sizes a numerical groundwater flow model was also established using visual modflow in which the river boundary was generalized into a third type of boundary condition and rhc zoning was performed to improve the accuracy of the simulation new hydrological insights the findings showed that accurate prediction of rhc is essential for the assessment of groundwater resources in riparian zones this is crucial for rbf managers as they will be

et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 at an rbf site the interactions between surface water and groundwater have important impacts on regional groundwater resources they are particularly important when river water infiltrates into the aquifer driven by an increasing hydraulic gradient between the groundwater and the river during groundwater exploitation processes in the riparian zone house et al 2016 krause et al 2007 westbrook et al 2006 this river leakage is directly or indirectly affected by factors such as the hydraulic gradient between the groundwater table and river stage riverbed hydraulic conductivity rhc distribution of pumping wells temperature and pumping scheme doppler et al 2007 grischek and bartak 2016 ray et al 2002 owing to scouring and deposition processes during flooding and dry seasons strong temporal and spatial variations occur in rhc ghysels et al 2018 jin et al 2019 mutiti et al 2010 newcomer et al 2016 vasilevskiy et al 2019 which are often difficult to represent in a groundwater flow model river hydrodynamics and sediment transport are important factors that affect riverbed sediment characteristics naganna et al 2017 during the process of scouring and deposition sediment transport and deposition cause changes in the lithology structure and thickness of riverbeds also the redistribution of sediment particles with different sizes leads to changes in sediment porosity which fundamentally affects rhc levy et al 2011 mutiti and levy 2010 numerical simulations of river hydrodynamics and sediment transport began in the early 1950 s a wide range of models have been developed in recent decades each differing in complexity accuracy inputs and outputs approaches and spatial and temporal scales hajigholizadeh et al 2018 meselhe et al 2012 vercruysse et al 2017 considering the total non uniform sediment load current research on river sediment transport simulations has made considerable progress traditionally simulations of sediment transport particularly bed load transport were based on the assumption of local or instantaneous equilibrium spasojevic and holly 1993 given the temporal and spatial lags between sediment transport and water flow and considering the non equilibrium characteristics of sediment transport particularly under unsteady flow conditions the traditional sediment transport modeling approach has been gradually improved and altered to include non equilibrium behavior armanini and di silvio 1988 rahuel et al 1989 wu et al 2000 meeting the needs of engineering practices many newly developed models can simulate the transport of non cohesive and cohesive sediments local river channel scouring and channel widening and winding among others commercial and non commercial simulation softwares for hydrodynamics and

evolution salty tide uptrends environmental assessments waterway regulation flood evolution among others hu et al 2009 ramos et al 2019 waldman et al 2017 in general current research on changes in rhc during the scouring and deposition processes is mainly based on the theoretical understanding of field measurements and laboratory experiments ghysels et al 2018 newcomer et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 however few studies have focused on the relationship between spatiotemporal changes in rhc and river hydrodynamics arntzen et al 2006 this has led to inaccurate evaluations of groundwater recharge by surface water infiltration in an rbf system which limits the reasonable exploitation planning for groundwater resources in riparian zones nevertheless uncertainties in the interaction of surface water and groundwater were explored rassam et al 2013 however to the best of our knowledge when groundwater extraction results in the transformation of a gaining stream into a losing stream the effects of riverbed hydraulic conductivity on surface water groundwater exchange fluxes and groundwater flow modeling still remain largely unexplored the main objective of our study is to evaluate the aquifer exploitation potential at an rbf site by combining groundwater flow with sediment transport modeling our modeling approach specifically accounts for variations in riverbed hydraulic conductivity by using information from the distribution of riverbed sediment in particular to our knowledge this study is the first to use sediment transport modeling to generate spatially distributed rhc fields based on simulated grain size distributions additionally we were able to improve model simulation accuracy by generalizing how the river boundary is integrated into the groundwater flow model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we focused on an rbf site within the riparian zone located adjacent to the second songhua river in jilin province northeastern china at geographical coordinates 125 52 00 125 54 20 e 44 47 00 44 48 40 n fig 1 it covered an area of 4 71 km2 and provided cooling water for a corn deep processing plant the river is approximately 3200 m long and 500 m wide in the studied river section its average depth is 2 5 m and the riverbed sediment is mainly medium fine sand according to observational data collected at the songhua river hydrological station from 2007 to 2010 the average annual runoff is 156 108 m3 year and the average suspended load content is 0 051 kg m3 during the dry season and 0 115 kg m3 during the flood season major floods mostly occur in july august and september accounting for 60 70 of the total annual runoff riverbed sediments and bed topography have been discussed and analyzed in our previous work cui et al 2021 the strata in the study area are mainly composed of quaternary loose accumulation layers and cretaceous clastic rocks the quaternary strata are widely distributed without bedrock exposure the groundwater in the study area is mainly stored in a shallow unconfined aquifer in the quaternary sand and gravel layer with a thickness of 15 25 m it is the main target layer of the groundwater source and characterized by a binary structure with thin top and thick bottom and relatively high hydraulic conductivity fig 1 2 2 establishment of groundwater flow model a numerical model for groundwater flow at the rbf site was established eq 1 using the visual modflow vmod software version 4 2 waterloo hydrogeologic inc 2006 based on modflow 2005 which was originally developed by united states geological survey 1 x k h b h

km2 was equally divided into 120 rows and 140 columns with a total of 8350 effective grid cells each with an area of 560 m2 the medium in the study area was generalized as a single layer isotropic two dimensional unsteady flow aquifer with a thickness of 16 23 m the eastern boundary was generalized as a river boundary and the other boundaries were generalized as given head boundaries owing to the installation of observation wells fig s1 the simulation period extended from april to december 2016 with a total of eight stress periods and the time step for each stress period was one month the model identification period extended from april to august 2016 and the model validation period extended from august to december 2016 for the input data we applied the evt package and the river package the elevation data were obtained through field measurement of 400 points river stage and discharge data were collected from a nearby hydrological station songhuajiang station head data for a given head boundary were derived from monthly groundwater table measurements at the observation wells during the simulation period https doi pangaea de 10 1594 pangaea 937172 the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the aquifer were obtained through a pumping test table s1 precipitation and evapotranspiration data were obtained from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the groundwater extraction volumes were obtained from the corn deep processing plant and rhc was determined within the range of empirical values based on the riverbed sediment particle size table s1 the observed data were used to calculate the change in groundwater storage using eq 2 the product was then compared with the model simulation results to determine the error rate of model simulation under different boundary approaches 2 q μ f h where q is the change in groundwater storage μ is the specific yield of the aquifer dimensionless f is the study area m2 and h is the change in the groundwater table m positive value when rising negative value when falling 2 3 sensitivity analysis to improve the simulation accuracy of the vmod model and reduce the error caused by the uncertainty of the model parameters parameter sensitivity analysis of the groundwater flow numerical model was performed the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k specific yield μ rhc and recharge coefficient of precipitation α were selected as the main parameters for sensitivity analysis the parameters were increased and decreased by 10 20 and 30 when one parameter was changed the other parameters remained unchanged and the average change in the groundwater table in the observation well was used as a reference for sensitivity analysis 2 4 generalization of the river boundary in vmod the wide shallow river did not completely cut the aquifer which indicates that the bottom elevation of the river was higher than that of the aquifer in the northeastern part of the simulation area thus the river was generalized using the third type of boundary condition the interaction between the surface water and groundwater river leakage or groundwater recharge was generalized as a one dimensional vertical flow which was calculated using eq 3 in the river sub routine of the model 3 q r g b l k m h r h s where q r g is the amount of river water recharge or discharge to groundwater m3 d k m is the riverbed hydraulic conductivity m d b is the width of the river m l is the river length m h r is the river stage m h is the groundwater table m and s is the riverbed sediment thickness according to the observed data of the initial field investigation the particle size of the riverbed deeper than 50 cm is relatively stable while the particle size of the riverbed shallower than 50 cm changes greatly which has a significant impact on the rhc therefore s was set as 0 5 m in this study m to consider the effects of rhc on the results of the model the river boundary was addressed in different approaches fig s1 1 as a linear boundary given the average width bottom elevation and thickness of the riverbed and a homogenous empirical value for vertical rhc and 2 as a polygon boundary divided into different zones the vertical rhc riverbed bottom elevation and riverbed sediment thickness changed over time monthly zonation of the parameters that changed over time in the second approach was input to the polygon river boundary it was continuously iterated to the next month after calculation or simulation based on the delft3d model zone division of the polygon river boundary in the vmod model was performed manually we divided the riverbed into different zones according to the riverbed morphology main troughs sandbanks shoals and deep troughs thus river hydrodynamic conditions and rhc values were similar within each zone then the particle size data simulated by the delft3d model were used to calculate the rhc of each zone according to the rhc calculation formula obtained by the genetic algorithm ga method the rhc value of each zone is the average value of all sampling points within the zone the average value in each zone was then assigned to the vmod model 2 5 quantitative estimation of rhc stepwise regression analysis sra is used to reduce the degree of multi collinearity by eliminating variables that are the least important and highly related to other variables jennrich and sampson 1968 kabe 1963 the variables are introduced in the model one by one and an f test is performed after each explanatory variable is introduced the selected explanatory variables are tested one by one using a student s t test when the original explanatory variable is no longer significant owing to the introduction of a later explanatory variable it is deleted to ensure that only significant variables are included in the regression equation before introducing a new variable this is an iterative process wherein the final set of explanatory variables can be guaranteed to be optimal until neither significant explanatory variables are selected for the regression equation nor all insignificant explanatory variables are removed from the regression equation based on previous studies d10 d30 d50 d60 d90 cc cu are important physical characteristics to calculate hydraulic conductivity using grain size distribution in empirical equations odong 2007 additionally water depth and flow velocity often affect the distribution of sediment particles therefore in this study nine explanatory variables including d10 d30 d50 d60 d90 cc cu water depth and flow velocity were selected and sra were used to eliminate the highly interdependent multi collinear variables using spss software the selected explanatory variables are shown in the results section section 3 4 ga is a computational model that simulates the biological process of natural selection and the genetic mechanism of darwinian biological evolution theory the method determines the optimal solution by simulating a natural evolution process ga encodes the group of parameters to be calculated and uses the population to describe the parameter intervals mirjalili 2019 a set of optimal parameters is obtained through continuous selection crossover and mutation by adopting a probabilistic optimization method gobeyn et al 2017 zhang and xin 2017 in this study nsga ii was used to fit and quantitatively estimate the relationship between rhc and its main controlling parameters derived from the sra and thus obtain a quantitative formula for rhc the model fitted the mathematical relationship based on the observed data and determined the best fitting result was selected for the further analysis r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate the fitting effect the closer their values are to 1 the more accurate is the mathematical relationship 2 6 sediment sampling and water depth measurement eighteen sampling points numbered s1 s18 were arranged from both banks to the river center forming five cross sections from upstream to downstream and one longitudinal section along the main channel fig 2 the bed sediments were collected using a beeker sampler lm30 04 23 sa netherlands with a sampling depth range of 0 50 cm below the riverbed in may dry period july flood period and november discharge recession period in 2016 the sediments were then placed in pvc tubes or polymethyl methacrylate columns for analysis a total of 60 measurement points were arranged within the riverbed to measure the water depth using a homemade sounding weight and leveling device made of a 20 m long measuring rope and an 5 kg lead weight when the sounding weight sank to the bottom of the river the tick mark on the tight rope at the water s surface was read as the water depth dense measurements were obtained using a leveling instrument in locations where the topography fluctuated widely e g land areas such as sandbanks and beaches a constant head permeability test fig s2 and particle size analyses using the sieving method were conducted in the laboratory to determine the hydraulic conductivities d10 d30 d50 d60 d90 the coefficient of curvature cc and the coefficient of uniformity cu of the riverbed sediment moreover the water depth and velocity at each sampling point were measured using a sounding weight and a current meter fp211 global water usa the riverbed sediment samples were collected from the river using a beeker sampler and were directly loaded into darcy experimental columns with the same diameter 11 cm filling the column in the field minimizes the disturbance to the sediment sample allowing the initial layering to remain intact the rhc was then calculated using the following equation 4 k m ql h 1 h 2 a where k m is the rhc m d q is the flow rate m3 s h 1 and h 2 indicate the water head before and after passing through the sediment sample respectively m l is the length of the riverbed sediment sample along the flow direction m and a is the cross sectional area of the experimental column m2 2 7 prediction of the variable boundary conditions river stage river discharge and precipitation are important variable boundary conditions in the delft3d and vmod models in dry wet and normal years the hydrological frequency analysis method was used to predict the river stage and river discharge according to the statistical data of the river discharge we analyzed the quantitative relationship between the river discharge data from 2006 to 2017 and the frequency of occurrence according to table 1 the hydrological years were classified as dry wet and normal the discharge data of each hydrological year can be obtained according to the hydrologic frequency analysis moreover the historical river stage and river discharge in the study area showed a good correlation therefore river stage data that need to be input to the boundary in the delft3d or vmod model can be derived from the stage discharge correlation under different hydrological years table s2 hydrological conditions largely depend on atmospheric precipitation we chose the three years with measured discharge data closest to those of the three design frequencies namely 2014 for a wet year 2006 for a normal year and 2009 for a dry year the precipitation data of these three years were input to the vmod model as variable conditions for scenarios of wet normal and dry years 2 8 simulation and prediction of rhc based on the flow continuity equation horizontal momentum equation vertical velocity equation and three dimensional advection diffusion mass balance equation for suspended sediment an open source delft3d model was used to simulate and predict the temporal and spatial changes in the riverbed topography and the characteristic particle sizes of the riverbed sediments based on the particle size data temporal and spatial distributions of rhc were calculated using the quantitative formula mentioned in section 2 6 fig s3 this analysis provided the parameter basis for evaluating and predicting the groundwater resource quantity in this model we used the finite difference method dividing the riverbed in the study area into 1480 grid cells of 20 74 with minimum and maximum grid lengths of 2 m and 30 m respectively the simulation period extended from march 2016 to march 2017 the initial riverbed topography was interpolated according to the water depth data collected at 60 measurement points the daily river stage discharge and sediment concentration in the input data were obtained from hydrological stations located in the upper and lower reaches of the study area the upstream entrance boundary of the simulation area was a total discharge boundary whereas the downstream outlet boundary was a water level boundary the incoming and outgoing sediment conditions were set at the upper and lower boundaries the time step calculated by the model was 0 1 min combined with the distributions of riverbed sediment particle sizes and actual sediment transport the initial sediment load was set into four components table s3 the mud in component 1 was a wash load the sand in components 2 3 and 4 was a bed material load the thickness of the migration layer and the lower layer were set to 0 5 m and 2 m respectively based on the predicted river stage river discharge regional precipitation and rhc the groundwater exploitation potential under different hydrological years was predicted using the established groundwater flow numerical model 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation the parameter sensitivity analysis of the vmod model is shown in table 2 average groundwater table change is inversely proportional to the change in specific yield and directly proportional to the change in other parameters the influence of rhc on the model is much greater than that of other parameters therefore to improve simulation accuracy it is necessary to improve the accuracy of rhc input values in the calibration process when the river boundary was treated as a linear boundary the calibrated parameter values in the vmod model were determined as shown in table s3 under the best fitting effect of the vmod and delft3d model the simulated and observed values of the groundwater table in the observation well sediment particle size and riverbed elevation were fitted as shown in fig 3 3 2 riverbed sediment particle sizes and rhc based on the observed data of sediment particle size of 18 sampling points table s4 the validation of the delft3d model showed that the model was reliable for the simulation and prediction of sediment particle size and bed topography based on the simulation results of the delft3d model the evolution of the effective particle size d10 of the riverbed sediment is shown in fig s4 after the inflow process from the end of may to the beginning of june the d10 of the main channel sediment reached a maximum value of 0 22 mm owing to continuous scouring of the river s main channel under strong hydrodynamic conditions in other parts of the riverbed this value varied by an order of magnitude over time indicating that the main channel sediments were constantly moving owing to suspension saltation and traction the evolution of the d50 of riverbed sediment particles is shown in fig s5 the spatial distribution of d50 was characterized by a main channel larger than both its sides after the inflow process from the end of may to the beginning of june the sediment d50 on the left side of the sandbar and the beach in the middle river gradually increased from 0 25 mm to 0 35 mm and then stabilized indicating that the riverbed sediment was continuously washed away forming a deep groove and the particle size changed from fine to coarse 3 3 bed topography bed topography variation in the simulated river was the highest in may and june while the degree of topography variation decreased after july during the inflow process in may and june the beaches and sandbanks on the left and right sides of the riverbed were partially or completely submerged after the river stage rose then the edges near the main groove were partially washed away and the range was smaller than that before the inflow process fig 4 from the upstream to downstream regions the elevation of the riverbed in the main channel initially fluctuated sharply at 600 m and 1750 m fig 5 downstream from the entrance section during the simulation period scouring and deposition conditions changed over time the riverbed in the upstream area 0 800 m mainly exhibited scouring with a scouring thickness of up to 2 m from 800 2000 m the riverbed experienced alternating scouring and deposition conditions and the beach slowly moved downstream at 2000 m the effect of deposition on the riverbed was the strongest with a deposition thickness of up to 3 m the highest deposition rate occurred during the wet season may and june 3 4 estimation of rhc two regression models were obtained from the sra after two explanatory variables in the order of d10 and d50 were introduced and seven variables were eliminated this indicates that the linear regression model established using independent and dependent variables has enhanced statistical significance model b presented a better fit than model a table s5 in particular the multiple correlation coefficient of model b was greater than that of model a we concluded that the two independent variables d10 and d50 were the most important factors affecting changes in rhc table s6 the relationships between the independent variables d10 and d50 and the dependent variable rhc were quantitatively estimated and optimized using the ga yielding a quantitative estimation formula as follows eq 4 5 k 2287 8 d 10 2 2 18 d 50 3 the goodness of fit coefficient of determination r2 and nse were selected to evaluate the fitting and optimization effect of the estimation formula fig 6 in general the closer the nse is to 1 the better is the simulation accuracy of the model the values of r2 and nse were 0 96 and 0 95 respectively indicating that the quantitative estimation of rhc obtained using this formula was reliable 3 5 zone division of rhc as the attributes of riverbed sediments alter periodically within the year the rhc of normal wet and dry years were estimated based on the predicted riverbed sediment particle sizes and quantitative estimation formula of rhc subsequently rhc was partitioned into zones and assigned monthly values notably changes in rhc mainly occurred in april june august and november figs s6 s8 in which 0 m d represents a sandbar that is not submerged or a zone with an extremely low rhc at the edge of the riverbank 3 6 groundwater balance analysis the results of a groundwater balance analysis in the simulation area for the linear and polygon river boundary conditions using vmod are presented in table 3 groundwater is mainly recharged by river leakage lateral inflow and precipitation infiltration for the two river boundary conditions linear and polygon boundaries the total groundwater recharge amounts in the study area were 11 577 0 m3 d and 14 161 4 m3 d respectively while river leakage accounted for 49 5 and 63 1 of the total recharge respectively however groundwater is mainly discharged by direct groundwater evaporation from aquifer groundwater pumping and lateral inflow the total groundwater discharge amounts were 9820 4 m3 d and 12 131 4 m3 d and base flow accounted for 0 02 and 3 5 of the total amount respectively the simulation area was generally in a positive equilibrium state and the storage changes were 1756 6 m3 d and 2030 0 m3 d respectively indicating that the aquifer in the study area still has exploitation potential 3 7 prediction of groundwater exploitation potential at present the total groundwater pumping rate at the rbf site is far below the designed rate and the groundwater volume is in a positive equilibrium state indicating that the scale of groundwater exploitation can still be expanded therefore the groundwater exploitation potential must be evaluated the average thickness of the aquifer at the rbf site is 21 m using 1 3 of the thickness of the aquifer 7 m as the maximum allowable groundwater drawdown within the cone of groundwater depression except the location within the pumping well s radius of influence the groundwater table dynamics in the next 5 years under different pumping schemes can be predicted the prediction could be used to determine the relationship between the pumping rate and the maximum drawdown of the groundwater depression cone which facilitates the determination of the groundwater exploitation potential of the aquifer the groundwater in the rbf is currently pumped intermittently through 16 wells with a pumping rate of 5900 m3 d the average single well pumping rate is 368 8 m3 d which is far below the designed rate 2400 3000 m3 d thus to increase the total pumping rate there is no need to increase the number of pumping wells instead only the pumping rate of the existing single wells should be increased six different pumping schemes were set by multiplying the current total pumping rate by 2 7 times table s7 for the six pumping schemes the groundwater table at the center of the groundwater depression cone continued to decline under conditions of continuous wet normal and dry years and stabilized after one year the maximum drawdown of the cone increased with the pumping rate exhibiting a good positive linear correlation fig 7 according to the fit relationship between the pumping rate and maximum drawdown the maximum exploitation potentials of the rbf site aquifer for continuous wet normal and dry years were calculated as 41 200 m3 d 39 000 m3 d and 31 100 m3 d respectively when the actual drawdown of the cone center reached the allowable drawdown 7 m the simulated groundwater hydraulic heads in the three conditions are shown in fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 influence of spatiotemporal variations in rhc rhc may not be the most sensitive parameter in many groundwater simulation studies however the river leakage caused by the exploitation of groundwater in the riparian zone is a relatively important groundwater recharge parameter which is affected by rhc the sensitivity of rhc is then highlighted therefore more accurate rhc data are needed when establishing groundwater flow models in riparian zones the variation range of the rhc simulated in this study is from 0 3 to 55 8 m d a relevant study have shown that rhc exhibits a meter scale spatial variation and both horizontal and vertical rhc vary over several orders of magnitude ghysels et al 2018 in another study the rhc ranged from 0 08 to 2 7 m d and were closely related to the grain size thickness and the clogging of the riverbed matusiak et al 2021 the polygon river boundary approach improved the simulation accuracy of the vmod model with r2 increased by nearly 0 04 fig 9 compared with the linear boundary approach fig 3d as shown in table 3 when considering the spatial and temporal changes in rhc during scouring and deposition the amount of river leakage and base flow increased significantly thereby affecting the amount of lateral inflow and evaporation in contrast without considering the spatial and temporal changes in rhc the river leakage was underestimated during the groundwater resource quantity calculation indicating that spatiotemporal changes in rhc under different hydrodynamic conditions have profound effects on river leakage fig 10 groundwater table monitoring data indicate that the groundwater table in the study area increased by an average of 0 85 m from april to december 2016 the change in groundwater storage was calculated using eq 2 the specific yield μ was determined to be 0 13 through a pumping test and f was 4 71 106 m2 therefore q was calculated as 5 20 105 m3 the calculated aquifer storage change results were 4 29 105 and 4 95 105 m3 respectively during the 244 day simulation period under the two river boundary conditions liner and polygon boundaries the error rates between the change in groundwater storage calculated from the monitoring data and the storage change calculated using the numerical model were 17 5 and 4 8 respectively this indicates that the model objectively reflects the actual hydrogeological conditions in the study area when considering the spatiotemporal changes in rhc during scouring and deposition 4 2 assumptions and limitations riverbeds are transient several studies have addressed this topic and suggested methods to observe and quantify these variations gianni et al 2016 partington et al 2017 tang et al 2018 in this study it was assumed that the river aquifer interface was isotropic continuous and saturated and that the shallow layer of the riverbed was dominated by vertical flow the presence of unsaturated zones at the river aquifer interface has large implications for numerous hydraulic and chemical processes estimation of the upper bound of the spatial extent of unsaturated areas beneath a riverbed can help inform the choice of a suitable numerical simulator for river aquifer systems schilling et al 2017 additionally future studies could look into the use of more advanced parameter optimization methods to determine model uncertainty or handle correlated interdependent decision variables during parameter estimation the use of grain size analysis to estimate hydraulic conductivity has certain limitations grain size based methods may sometimes overestimate vertical hydraulic conductivity brunner et al 2017 while in a lot of rivers with gravel beds grain size analysis is simply not a suitable method as one could barely capture the entire grain size distribution through field sampling and thus probably underestimating k chen 2000 pointed out that estimation of hydraulic conductivity by grain size analysis precludes the consideration of anisotropy additionally grain size analysis cannot consider preferential pathways and those can be important in riverbeds therefore based on the assumption of isotropic and vertical flow determining the most relevant particle parameters to rhc is the prerequisite for the application of the grain size based method anisotropy is critical for the river sediment system as we assumed vertical flow in the riverbed we did not evaluate the anisotropy however the assumption of isotropic conditions can significantly undermine the credibility of model predictions anisotropy is strongly suggested to be included as an additional calibration parameter ideally using transient observation of hydraulic heads gianni et al 2019 this study determined the exploitation potential of riparian groundwater based on site monitoring and model simulations from a macro perspective however the increase in river infiltration rates driven by groundwater extraction causes clogging within the sediments and aquifer involving physical chemical and biological processes battin and sengschmitt 1999 jin et al 2019 song et al 2020 these processes and mechanisms will be better understood with microscopic experiments in the laboratory yang et al 2021 the changes in the sediment structure of the river bed in this study were mainly affected by the physical processes driven by the hydrodynamics of the river water however the approach may no longer be applicable when biological or chemical processes in the riverbed sediment dominates the permeability of the riverbed sediment 4 3 implications for riparian ecology groundwater plays an important role in riparian ecosystems groundwater discharge is the driving force of riparian patterns in plant species composition jansson et al 2007 kibler et al 2021 meanwhile riparian vegetation typically has a great influence on groundwater level and groundwater sustained stream baseflow gribovszki et al 2008 the interaction and feedback between groundwater and vegetation in the riparian zone is usually balanced different vegetation species have their optimum groundwater table range the exploitation of groundwater in the riparian zone should fully consider the river leakage and predict the fluctuation range of the groundwater table to exploit the groundwater within the optimum range of groundwater fluctuation which will contribute to the health of the riparian ecosystem 5 conclusions strong spatiotemporal variability was observed in rhc controlled by hydrodynamic conditions when pumping groundwater in riparian zones the temporal and spatial variation of rhc has great influence on the quantity of groundwater resources according to monthly rhc simulations and calculation results the rhc was partitioned into zones and assigned a monthly value that can more accurately reflect the rhc spatiotemporal changes and improve groundwater simulation accuracy in the study area when considering the spatiotemporal variability of rhc the simulation accuracy of the groundwater resource can also be improved to a certain extent the exploitation of groundwater in riparian zones should fully consider river leakage the improvement of the simulation accuracy of groundwater model can improve the calculation accuracy of river leakage thereby avoiding the overestimation and underestimation of groundwater resources caused by changes in the permeability of riverbed sediments to a certain extent therefore this is crucial for rbf managers as they will be able to adjust the pumping rate according to the hydrological conditions of the river to either access higher quantities water resources in wet years or avoid a series of ecological and geological problems caused by excessive groundwater exploitation in dry

however the sm2rasc and cmorph crt products tended to underestimate the gauged precipitation and provided unsatisfactory performance in streamflow simulation overall our findings suggest that srp products can be a priori alternative sources of precipitation data suitable for hydrological applications in poorly gauged areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords data scarcity hydrological modeling satellite precipitation sensitivity analysis swat model 1 introduction precipitation is a key component of hydrological cycles and land atmosphere interactions and plays an important role in a range of applications such as hydrological modeling understanding water balances and climate change prediction jiang et al 2012 talchabhadel et al 2021 accurate and reliable information on the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation is therefore crucial for many fields of study the acquisition of precipitation data is often limited to ground based observations such as precipitation gauges and weather radars behrangi et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 although such precipitation acquisition techniques may provide relatively accurate and real time precipitation information le et al 2020 they are frequently prone to large missing values wind effects and uneven spatial distribution maggioni et al 2016 moreover radar systems are often not feasible for developing countries mainly due to economic and technological constraints le et al 2020 satgé et al 2020 limited availability of precipitation information is one of the factors that significantly restricts the accuracy of hydrological models cortés et al 2011 as a result several recent studies have focused on utilizing different precipitation datasets to support hydrological modeling in poorly gauged or ungauged catchments because of the low cost and high spatial coverage satellite based and reanalysis based estimates are among the most attractive approaches for obtaining continuous and spatially distributed precipitation datasets with high spatial and temporal resolutions to provide improved support for hydrological models amorim et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 algorithms to estimate precipitation from satellite observations are based on infrared radiation microwave radiation or a combination of the two the infrared sensors carried by geostationary earth orbiting satellites provide precipitation indirectly from the tops of clouds based on the relationship between the infrared cloud top temperature and the precipitation probability at the ground prigent 2010 in contrast microwave based estimates are based on the principle that precipitation at the surface is related to microwave emission from raindrops in low frequency channels and microwave scattering from ice at high frequency channels hong et al 2019 both passive radiometer and active radar microwave observations are currently available from satellites in low earth orbit reanalysis precipitation products have also become an attractive alternative source for hydrological applications the reanalysis based approach combines field observation data and climate model predictions using a data assimilation system to estimate surface precipitation lakew et al 2020 lockhoff et al 2019 although satellite and reanalysis based precipitation srp estimates provide precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolutions their performances are often constrained by estimation biases and errors yin et al 2021 advances in blending programs such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp have recently enabled integration of srp estimates with gauge observations to yield more reliable precipitation information for hydrological studies the srp products that are currently available to the public include precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks from climate data record persiann cdr hsu et al 1997 integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2007 climate prediction center morphing technique with corrected bias cmorph crt joyce et al 2004 and soil moisture to rain derived from the advanced scatterometer sm2rasc brocca et al 2014 the european center for medium range weather forecast ecmwf reanalysis 5th generation product era5 hersbach et al 2019 is among the reanalysis based precipitation datasets being used in a wide range of applications because of their indirect retrieval of precipitation values the srp products contain various sources of inherent error satellite precipitation estimates contain inevitable errors that result from sampling uncertainties and sensor shortcomings hussain et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the reanalysis precipitation products also contain significant uncertainties that arise from model errors and observation errors in the data assimilation system nie et al 2015 moreover the performance of srp products can vary between regions topographical conditions and products amjad et al 2020 wei et al 2017 therefore it is essential to quantitatively assess the quality of precipitation from different sources before using the data in hydrological and hydro climatic studies amjad et al 2020 to date some studies have been done to evaluate the performance of srp products and the effect of this performance on hydrological simulations amorim et al 2020 le et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wedajo et al 2021 the existing studies have mainly focused on evaluating a single product or a few products in some cases different versions of the same product e g wang et al 2017 su et al 2019 and for limited periods so their estimated errors may not reflect long term conditions moreover most of the studies were completed before the release of the latest versions of products such as era5 and imerg v06 hence there is a notable gap in the literature associated with evaluating the accuracy of multiple and long term srp products for hydrological simulations and this gap was an important motivation for the present study the specific aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the performance of srp products and their utility in hydrological modeling the study consists of two main parts 1 evaluating the performance of srp products against ground observations at different timescales and 2 assessing the hydrological utility of the srp products for simulating streamflow processes and states we hypothesized that the products we evaluated would differ in their performance within a given study area and that these differences would affect their ability to reliably support hydrological modeling 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the porijõgi catchment is located 5 10 km south of tartu estonia and lies between 26 32 e and 26 54 e and between 58 7 n and 58 17 n with an area of 258 km2 fig 1 the catchment is one of the tributaries of the emajõgi river which flows into lake peipsi a major part of the catchment is located on the otepää heights with a fragmented landscape mander et al 2010 agriculture and forest are the dominant land use types in the basin and cover 45 and 49 of the total area respectively mander et al 2000 the catchment is characterized by undulating topography with elevations ranging from 31 to 188 m above sea level a s l and a mean elevation of 95 8 m the upland soils are mainly podzoluvisols planosols and podzols with a loamy sand or fine sandy loam texture and a surface soil organic matter content of 1 6 1 9 kmoch et al 2021 peatlands and gleysols dominate the valleys and lower parts of the basin the mean annual temperature is 6 4 c with mean monthly temperatures ranging from 4 5 c in january to 18 3 c in july and the mean annual precipitation is 678 mm 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 gauge observations the hydrometeorological data required to evaluate the performance of the srp products and initialize hydrological simulation in the swat model discussed in section 2 3 2 were obtained from the estonian weather service database we used daily precipitation data from three stations i e tõravere piigaste and otepää fig 1 other necessary climate data were the daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the daily streamflow m3 s 1 records from 2007 to 2020 were obtained from the reola hydrological station at the outlet of the catchment 2 2 2 satellite based and reanalysis precipitation products we chose five srp products sm2rasc imerg persiann cdr era5 and cmorph crt that provided data from 2007 to 2020 for the performance evaluation basic information about these products is summarized in table s1 sm2rasc is a global scale precipitation product derived from soil moisture through the application of the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2019 it is a new product based on an innovative bottom up approach for retrieving precipitation from soil moisture observations based on the inversion of the hydrological water balance equation brocca et al 2013 while other satellite based instantaneous precipitation rates are estimated based on a top down approach the algorithm provides cumulative daily precipitation products we used the most recently released version 1 4 of sm2rasc with 0 1 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution imerg is an extension of trmm that provides an improved capability to measure light precipitation and snowfall huffman et al 2007 it uses inter calibrated estimates from the international constellation of satellites that provide precipitation relevant data and other data sources moazami and najafi 2021 imerg products are bias corrected using monthly precipitation reanalysis results from the global precipitation climate center gpcc fang et al 2019 we used the recently released v06 imerg product with 0 1 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution persiann cdr is the product of the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing and employs artificial neural networks to estimate precipitation rates from cloud top temperatures measured using gridded satellite infrared data gridsat b1 le et al 2020 the estimated precipitation is then adjusted using the gpcc monthly product wang et al 2017 we used the persiann cdr product with 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution era5 is the latest fifth generation global atmospheric reanalysis precipitation dataset developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf jiao et al 2021 era5 combines vast amounts of historical observations into global estimates using four dimensional variational data assimilation and modeling systems jiang et al 2021 we used the product with a spatial resolution of 0 75 and daily temporal resolution cmorph crt products are generated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center s cpc s morphing technique joyce et al 2004 the technique applies passive microwave sensors to estimate precipitation and uses infrared data to propagate the estimated products when no microwave data are available joyce et al 2004 this product uses the probability density function pdf matching technique for bias correction using the cpc daily data we used the most recent product version 1 0 of cmorph crt with 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution fig 2 presents the spatial distribution of the grid cells and daily precipitation intensities 21 august 2019 for our study area 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 evaluation of srp products we adopted a point to grid pairwise evaluation approach to assess the performance of the five products at each precipitation gauge station to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the products we used four continuous and three categorical metrics the continuous statistical metrics were pearson s correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse relative bias rb and mean absolute error mae the lower the rmse mae and rb and the higher the r the better the agreement between the srp product and the gauge observations the categorical metrics were the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi the higher the pod and csi and the lower the far the more reliable the performance of a product table s2 provides the equations used to calculate the statistical metrics we used to evaluate the srp products we calculated the categorical statistical metrics using a 2 2 contingency table table 1 for different daily precipitation threshold values to better understand the detection ability of the srp products at various levels of precipitation intensity using the categorical measures we arbitrarily classified the dominantly occurring precipitation events pr between 0 01 and 10 mm day into three intensity classes low pr 1 mm moderate 1 pr 5 mm and high 5 pr 10 mm we also used the pdf technique to quantify the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation in distinct intensity ranges pdf is the ratio of the frequency of occurrence in specific intervals to the overall number of events shen et al 2021 moreover we used a taylor diagram taylor 2001 to compare the products in terms of their r rmse and standard deviation 2 3 2 swat model and input data the soil and water assessment tool swat is a physical based semi distributed model that calculates daily and monthly hydrological balance parameters in a watershed arnold et al 1998 swat lets users modify the physical parameters to better represent the real conditions of the modeled watershed the model centers on the principle that the water balance equation is a proxy for all processes that occur in the watershed system araza et al 2021 sw sw 0 i 1 t r sr et p rf where sw is the final soil water content at time t sw 0 is the initial soil water content r is the amount of precipitation precipitation sr is surface runoff et is evapotranspiration p is percolation water that passes below the soil profile and rf is the groundwater return flow we used the merit digital elevation model dem yamazaki et al 2019 for elevation data the estonian topographic database estonian land board for land use data and the harmonized world soil database fischer et al 2008 for soil data fig 3 the hydrometeorological datasets used for model simulation are described in section 2 2 1 and table s3 we used version 1 1 of the qswat3 plug in for version 3 16 5 of the qgis software to set up the model and generate watershed networks subbasins and hydrologic response units hrus based on the dem we applied a drainage contributing area larger than a threshold of 5 km2 to discretize the watershed into 37 sub basins for discretizing hrus we considered a threshold parameter of 10 for land use soil and slope resulting in 357 hrus 2 3 3 model parameters and sensitivity analysis process based hydrological models like swat are generally characterized by a multitude of parameters because of spatial variability measurement errors and complexity in hydrological processes the values of many parameters are not exactly known holvoet et al 2005 a parameter sensitivity analysis provides insights on which parameters contribute most to the output variance due to input variability holvoet et al 2005 we performed an lh oat sensitivity analysis in swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup which combines the latin hypercube lh sampling and one factor at a time oat design techniques van griensven et al 2006 based on the swat input output documentation and previous studies abbaspour et al 2015 we selected 19 parameters to support a sensitivity analysis using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 in swat cup we found nine parameters table 2 with sufficient sensitivity for use in calibration and validation we defined the sensitivity by ranking the parameters in order of decreasing sensitivity then using pairwise t tests to identify pairs that differed significantly p 0 05 2 3 4 model calibration and validation the entire period of the simulation was from 1 january 2008 31 december 2019 the first two years 2008 and 2009 were used as a warm up period the next five years 2010 2014 and the last five years 2015 2019 were used for calibration and validation respectively the calibration process was carried out in two steps according to abbaspour et al 2017 parameters that introduce water into the system such as snow parameters and canopy storage parameters should be calibrated independently from other parameters and excluded from further calibration because they will cause identifiability problems therefore we performed the first calibration for seven snow and canopy storage related parameters and excluded them from further calibration after adjusting them and fixing them at their best values the second calibration was done for the main parameters indicated in table 2 sufi 2 is an interactive procedure that does not require many runs to attain a reasonable result abbaspour et al 2017 thus we performed 500 2000 simulations with 5 10 iterations until we achieved a reasonable nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse for validation we ran the model with the input parameters set during the calibration process 2 3 5 model performance evaluation the performance of the models in simulating the monthly streamflow was evaluated using nse as the objective function based on the recommendation by moriasi et al 2007 we divided the model performance into four categories unsatisfactory nse 0 50 satisfactory 0 50 nse 0 65 good 0 65 nse 0 75 and very good nse 0 75 we used the coefficient of determination r 2 the percent bias pbias the r factor and the p factor as complementary indicators in the performance evaluation p and r are measures of the uncertainty of the model prediction p indicates the fraction of the observed data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu and r implies the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu band and the standard deviation of the measured variable abbaspour et al 2015 table s4 summarizes the statistical metrics used to evaluate the performance of the swat model we evaluated the effect of each precipitation dataset on monthly streamflow simulation by developing six models one per spr product and one for the precipitation gauge data with all other swat inputs held constant the gauge simulated model was used as an evaluation benchmark fig 4 shows the workflow of our study 3 results 3 1 evaluation of srp products 3 1 1 daily evaluation the amount of the daily precipitation showed a similar distribution pattern across the three precipitation gauge stations fig 5a table s5 for all products more than 60 of precipitation fell within the low intensity range 1 mm day and the occurrence frequency decreased with increasing intensity fig 5b imerg era5 and persiann cdr slightly underestimated the occurrence frequency of low intensity precipitation and overestimated the next higher intensities in contrast cmorph crt and sm2rasc overestimated low intensity precipitation and underestimated the next higher intensity ranges we also evaluated the daily performance of the srp products using scatterplots and the continuous statistical metrics defined in section 2 3 1 fig s1 the results showed weak performance of the srp products on a daily scale with low correlation values r 0 22 0 39 and high deviation from the observed mean rb of 18 73 fig 6 presents the performance of the srp products according to the detection based indices the median values of pod and csi for all products at all intensity classes were less than 0 5 whereas the median values of far were greater than 0 5 except for imerg and era5 at low intensity indicating the low quality of srp products for detecting daily precipitation events in the study area the median values of pod and csi increased with increasing precipitation intensity whereas far decreased or did not change among the five srp products imerg and cmorph crt show the best or close to the best and the worst or close to the worst performance respectively more information on the detection capability of the srp products at various precipitation thresholds can be found in fig s2 3 1 2 monthly evaluation based on the monthly cumulative precipitation fig 7a all srp products followed a trend similar to the gauge observations and the slope of the curve increased with time however the products exhibited substantial divergence from the gauged precipitation with significant overestimation by imerg era5 and persiann cdr and significant underestimation by sm2rasc and cmorph crt the monthly mean precipitation from 2007 to 2020 fig 7b indicates that the maximum precipitation occurred during the summer months june to august which agrees with the results for all products the mean monthly precipitation for era5 imerg and persiann cdr agreed better with the gauged values with slight overestimation during the winter and autumn months but sm2rasc and cmorph crt exhibited substantial underestimation during the winter and spring months we used scatterplots and continuous statistical metrics fig 8 to further assess the agreement between the monthly srp products and the gauge observations imerg showed the best correlation with gauge observations r 0 84 followed by era5 r 0 74 the other srp datasets exhibited moderate r scores ranging from 0 61 to 0 70 overall increasing the temporal scale from daily to monthly resulted in a better correlation between the gauged and srp products the mae and rmse parameters supported these results 3 1 3 seasonal evaluation all products except sm2rasc showed the highest occurrence frequency 50 in the low intensity class 1 mm day in all seasons fig 9 the pdfs of imerg and era5 exhibited good performance at all precipitation intensities in contrast sm2rasc showed weaker agreement with gauge observations in all seasons with significant overestimation of the moderate intensity and significant underestimation of low and high intensities overall the srp products showed better performance in summer and weaker performance in winter in the taylor diagrams fig 10 the srp products closer to the gauge observations indicate better performance whereas the products lying below and above the reference line suggest lower and higher variability of the products relative to the gauge observations respectively nourani et al 2021 taylor 2001 all srp products showed the best performance in summer and the worst performance in winter imerg and era5 showed variability closest to that of the gauge observations in all seasons indicating the better performance of these products these two products also had better performance in terms of r with values ranging from 0 42 to 0 49 and 0 21 0 40 respectively 3 2 hydrological modeling sensitivity and uncertainty evaluation our results indicated that the model parameters cn2 esco alpha bnk and sol bd were the most sensitive parameters in all models and most strongly influenced streamflow in the study area the remaining five parameters gwqmn rchrg dp sol z sol awc and ch n2 were either still sensitive for some models or had no significant effect on streamflow simulations table s6 these parameters were the primary sources of uncertainty in streamflow simulation in the catchment fig 11 summarizes the uncertainty distribution for the nine parameters used for the streamflow simulations we have only shown the parameter uncertainty during the calibration period because we observed the same behavior during the validation period data not shown 3 3 streamflow simulation evaluation all precipitation products except sm2rasc and cmorph crt showed very good nse 0 75 and good 0 65 nse 0 75 performance for calibration and validation respectively fig 12 table 3 fig s3 although cmorph crt achieved satisfactory performance during the calibration period it was unsatisfactory during validation the sm2rasc model failed to achieve satisfactory performance for both calibration and validation nse 0 5 although most of the models underestimated the peak flows especially sm2rasc and cmorph crt they performed better in capturing the low flows fig 12 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the srp products all srp products exhibited low detection accuracies at a daily scale with low pod and csi values and a high far value the performance improved with increasing precipitation intensity the r values ranged from 0 22 to 0 39 which also indicates a poor correlation between the daily srp products and gauge observations however the monthly scale showed better performance with higher r values 0 61 0 84 and lower rmse values 21 35 mm month which agrees with the results of previous studies anjum et al 2019 ghozat et al 2021 several factors could explain this inconsistency between the daily and monthly performance the first relates to the gauge based information time step used to calibrate the srp products most of the srp products utilized in this study were calibrated using the gpcc precipitation data at a monthly scale which reduces monthly systematic errors but may not correctly capture the rapidly changing precipitation at time steps shorter than a month anjum et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 second this can be explained by the fact that the errors at the daily scale were nearly symmetrical fig s1 which could cancel each other after the aggregation liu et al 2015 it is worth mentioning that the low detection capability achieved by all srp products at the daily scale is also partly related to the precipitation intensity as reported in previous studies chen et al 2020 islam et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 both passive microwave and infrared sensors tend to detect high intensity precipitation events better and miss low intensities this is due to the higher signal to noise ratio and the favorable convective system particularly for microwave based measurements tan et al 2015 wu et al 2018 chen et al 2013 and satgé et al 2020 found that the better performance of srp products at higher intensity levels can be explained in three ways 1 rainfall collected during low intensity precipitation events that are correctly detected by infrared and passive microwave sensors might evaporate before they are recorded at the gauging stations 2 the gauges are not sufficiently sensitive to low intensity precipitation events and 3 the algorithms may be deficient the gauge observations used as ground truth values for performance evaluation are inherently subject to several errors related to wind effects and wetting evaporation losses peng et al 2020 therefore the effects of gauge observation uncertainties on evaluation performance cannot be neglected it has been widely reported lei et al 2021 tang et al 2018 tian et al 2018 that evaluating srp products using a high density of grid cells and gauging networks could enable more robust assessment results in the present study we used only three grid cells that corresponded to the three gauging stations in our study area which is likely to be a significant source of uncertainty all products except for sm2rasc tended to show better performance in summer and weaker performance in winter which is consistent with previous studies wei et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 we also observed relatively higher biases for the sm2rasc and cmorph crt products in winter and lower biases in summer data not shown chen et al 2019 suggested that the large bias for these products is closely related to the interference to passive microwave and advanced scatterometer ascat sensors created by precipitation sized ice particles or frozen surfaces the evaporation of low intensity precipitation before it reaches the land surface constitutes an additional factor that leads to the higher biases observed during the dry season beck et al 2017 the product comparison showed the best performance by imerg for all statistical indicators and all temporal scales previous studies also confirmed the superior performance of imerg in various parts of the world chen et al 2020 fang et al 2019 wei et al 2018 this can be attributed to the product s ability to integrate satellites and precipitation gauges combined with its higher spatial and temporal resolution unlike the other products imerg is also equipped with two sensors dual frequency precipitation radar and the gpm microwave imager that are highly sensitive to precipitation at a range of intensity levels chen et al 2020 tan and santo 2018 the sm2rasc and cmorph crt products showed the weakest agreement with gauge observations the inferior performance of sm2rasc is related to the weakness of the ascat sensor in terms of its lower ability to derive soil moisture variations when the surface moisture is nearly constant brocca et al 2014 2013 ciabatta et al 2015 the soils in the porijõgi catchment are more likely to experience saturation due to the frequent precipitation and relatively flat topography in such soils the soil moisture values remain roughly constant for any precipitation amount fereidoon et al 2019 in winter sm2rasc tends to underestimate precipitation at the low intensity and high intensity levels due to signal loss induced by the presence of spurious drizzle or noisy soil moisture brocca et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 the weaker performance of cmorph crt is possibly related to its dependence on a passive microwave sensor which is highly sensitive to the impacts of seasonal variability and has several problems associated with distinguishing between precipitation and frozen surfaces wei et al 2018 in general all srp products showed the best performance in summer and the worst performance in winter lei et al 2022 qin et al 2014 and tian et al 2009 also pointed out a seasonal difference in the performance of srp products with better performance in summer and weaker in winter these studies suggested that the poor performance of the products in winter is attributed to complex background emissivity from cold surface and snow cover subsequently producing high false precipitation events moreover kidd et al 2012 found that the failure of the satellites to accurately retrieve precipitation in winter is closely related to a greater occurrence of low intensity precipitation and the influence of frozen surface on passive microwave retrievals 4 2 hydrological modeling performance evaluation the srp products that performed well in precipitation validation also performed well in streamflow simulation the imerg model performed better than the other models including the gauge simulated model we attribute this strong performance to the generally high data quality and its ability to capture the spatial variability of precipitation in the catchment well in contrast the slightly weaker performance of the gauge simulated model is associated with the sparse and uneven distribution of the rainfall gauges which makes it difficult to accurately represent the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation goshime et al 2019 and wedajo et al 2021 also reported better performance of srp simulated monthly streamflow compared with gauge simulations in data scarce areas the models for the gauged imerg era5 and persiann cdr datasets slightly overestimated streamflow during the calibration period a negative pbias whereas sm2rasc and cmorph crt significantly underestimated the calibrated streamflow such disparities are mainly associated with the intrinsic variations in precipitation wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 our sensitivity analysis showed that cn2 esco alpha bnk and sol bd were the most sensitive parameters in all models suggesting that accurately assessing these parameters could significantly improve the model s ability to simulate monthly streamflow in the study area this finding agrees with previous studies leng et al 2020 singh and jha 2021 which found high sensitivity and a significant role of these parameters in maximizing model calibration accuracy cn2 lets the model govern the amount of surface runoff generated from each hru based on the relationship between precipitation the hydrologic soil group and land use donmez et al 2020 hence greater sensitivity of cn2 can be expected for most watersheds a high cn2 value indicates reduced infiltration whereas a low value corresponds to low surface runoff and high subsoil percolation donmez et al 2020 du et al 2020 our calibration results showed a 15 50 decrease in cn2 values for all models except sm2rasc and cmorph crt the initial value of cn2 in the models was 87 which is high for the land use and soil types in the study area therefore a large decrease in cn2 values can be attributed to the high initial cn2 values in the swat model raihan et al 2020 strauch et al 2012 moreover the low intensity precipitation physical soil properties and soil management practices in the study area might not be accurately reflected by the initial cn2 value thus leading to lower calibrated cn2 values decreasing cn2 improved the agreement between the measured and simulated hydrographs and increased infiltration which contributes to baseflow and recharge esco is used to modify the soil depth distribution needed to meet the evaporative demands of the water balance model therefore a change in esco affects the entire water balance component of the catchment cibin et al 2010 a lower esco value lets the model extract more of the evaporative demand from lower soil layers to compensate for a water deficit in upper layers malagò et al 2015 however a higher esco value represents increased baseflow tile drainage and surface runoff cibin et al 2010 according to arnold et al 2000 esco values between 0 75 and 1 0 are recommended however our results show that esco values lower than 0 6 tended to yield higher values of nse this indicates that soil water from deeper soil layers can be used to meet the evaporative demand a lower value of esco for the gauge simulated model than for the srp driven simulations suggests that the evapotranspiration demand is higher in the gauged simulation sol bd is closely related to soil infiltration and defines the relative amount of pore space in each soil layer odusanya et al 2021 the initial infiltration rate of the soil decreases with increasing bulk density leng et al 2020 li et al 2009 the high sensitivity of sol bd in the present study suggests that the lateral and vertical movement of water in the soil layers of the catchment significantly affected hydrological processes leng et al 2020 our calibration results indicated a small but significant tendency to increase sol bd values across the catchment by 5 15 leading to lower soil porosity in the model about 66 of the catchment is covered by histosols which are composed mainly of organic materials eagle and olander 2012 this originally leads to very low sol bd values in the catchment however the harmonized world soil database soil data provides the same numerical input values for most of the catchment area such as sol bd values of 1 6 mg cm3 and the same soil hydrological group d high runoff potential low infiltration rate neitsch et al 2011 which does not reflect the diversity of soils in the catchment in addition hydraulic conductivity k 6 793 and soil organic carbon soc 0 83 in the topsoil versus k 2 4265 and soc 0 28 in the subsoil and these values can only serve as proxies for the abundance of peatland and wetlands in the catchment alpha bnk characterizes the bank storage recession curve a large value approximately 1 indicates a smooth recession whereas a low value approximately 0 indicates a steep recession arnold et al 2013 our findings revealed alpha bnk values less than 0 4 for most of the models such tendencies towards smaller alpha bnk values means an increased movement of a substantial portion of bank storage into the adjacent unsaturated zones especially during the water deficient periods doble et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 the maximum canopy storage canmx parameter which we calibrated in the initial stage and excluded from further calibration was sensitive for all models canmx represents the maximum amount of precipitation that can be trapped in the canopy when the canopy is fully developed and plays an important role in the hydrological cycle of humid temperate regions arnold et al 2013 li et al 2021 our results showed a calibrated value of canmx ranging from 51 mm gauged model to 69 mm imerg model indicating that the vegetation canopies in the catchment retain more precipitation and allow for higher vegetation evapotranspiration li et al 2021 sol awc represents the available water capacity in soil layers a higher value of sol awc means a higher capacity of soils to hold water and less water availability for surface runoff and percolation our results showed up to a 40 decrease in sol awc values suggesting a reduced ability of the soil to hold water and a subsequent increase in the surface runoff and streamflow the high tendency of all models to extract water from lower soil layers i e low esco values could be attributed to a low water holding capacity of the soils in the catchment ch n2 which represents the main streamflow channel in the watershed system also had a strong impact on the performance of our models we found that the values of ch n2 ranging from 0 06 to 0 18 tended to yield greater nse values the values of ch n2 in our study were higher than the values in previous research and this indicates that the main channel in the study area is a natural stream with heavy brush surrounding the channel arnold et al 2013 this is a reasonable interpretation given the ecological environment in the catchment the hydrological parameters that were less sensitive or not significantly sensitive in the models were mainly groundwater parameters such as the depth of water for return flow gwqmn the deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf the groundwater delay time gw delay and the groundwater revap coefficient gw revap this indicates that groundwater interactions and fluxes related to these parameters have less effect on streamflow in the catchment dakhlalla and parajuli 2019 in distributed models like swat parameter sensitivity and uncertainty are strongly influenced by parameter interdependence and the nonlinear response of predictions to parameter changes which is referred to as parameter equifinality beven and binley 1992 the changes in some of the parameters may be compensated for by changes in others leading to different parameter sets that produce the same simulated results thus the uncertainties of some parameters observed in our models are likely to have been caused by the tradeoff effects between the parameters 5 conclusions the variation among the five srp products in their ability to estimate precipitation and the consequences for hydrological simulation accuracy confirmed our research hypotheses although none of the srp products provided high quality precipitation estimates at a daily scale most provided satisfactory performance at a monthly scale we also observed large discrepancies in the performance of the srp products between the different precipitation intensity classes our comparison among the five srp products at a daily scale showed particularly low performance for the sm2rasc and cmorph crt data and better performance for the imerg era5 and persiann cdr data the inferior performance of sm2rasc was related to the weakness of the ascat sensor s ability to derive soil moisture variations when the surface moisture is relatively constant whereas the limitations of cmorph crt were related to the weakness of the ability of the passive microwave sensors to correctly estimate precipitation we evaluated the performance of the precipitation products for streamflow simulation at a monthly scale using swat cup imerg performed best and cmorph crt performed worst among the selected products in both the statistical evaluations and the streamflow simulations we also observed that the optimal values for most parameters differed significantly among the models this shows a high degree of parameter uncertainty when different precipitation datasets are utilized our results confirmed a direct and significant impact of precipitation on the performance of streamflow simulations the sensitivity analysis showed that cn2 esco alpha bnk and sol bd were the most sensitive parameters for all models however other hydrological parameters related to groundwater gwqmn and rchrg dp the main channel ch n2 and the soil sol awc and sol z were less sensitive or had no significant effect on streamflow simulations for most of the models overall our results provide useful information about the application of srp products in streamflow simulation in data scarce areas at the basin scale since this study is the first attempt in estonia the best performance by imerg suggests the potential usefulness of this product for hydrological modeling applications the approach we described can also help researchers and managers identify suitable srp products that can be used in other basins along with the efforts to improve the srp products it will be important to develop more effective daily scale bias adjustment techniques credit authorship contribution statement evelyn uuemaa conceptualization resources supervision

7954,study region the porijõgi catchment in estonia northern europe study focus the lack of adequate precipitation gauges has long been a major obstacle for hydrological modeling to date the global availability of satellite and reanalysis precipitation srp products at an increasingly high spatiotemporal resolution has made their use in hydrological applications possible this study focuses on a comprehensive evaluation of the hydrological applicability of five srp products the evaluations were carried out in two parts 1 evaluating the quality of satellite and reanalysis based precipitation products relative to gauge observations and 2 comparing gauge simulated streamflow with srp based simulations using the swat model new hydrological insights for the region our results show moderate variation in the detection capability of srp products and in their influence on streamflow simulations none of the products performed well with daily scale predictions the imerg era5 and persiann cdr products showed the best detection capability for the monthly precipitation and demonstrated reliable performance to simulate the monthly streamflow 0 65 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient 0 75 however the sm2rasc and cmorph crt products tended to underestimate the gauged precipitation and provided unsatisfactory performance in streamflow simulation overall our findings suggest that srp products can be a priori alternative sources of precipitation data suitable for hydrological applications in poorly gauged areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords data scarcity hydrological modeling satellite precipitation sensitivity analysis swat model 1 introduction precipitation is a key component of hydrological cycles and land atmosphere interactions and plays an important role in a range of applications such as hydrological modeling understanding water balances and climate change prediction jiang et al 2012 talchabhadel et al 2021 accurate and reliable information on the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation is therefore crucial for many fields of study the acquisition of precipitation data is often limited to ground based observations such as precipitation gauges and weather radars behrangi et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 although such precipitation acquisition techniques may provide relatively accurate and real time precipitation information le et al 2020 they are frequently prone to large missing values wind effects and uneven spatial distribution maggioni et al 2016 moreover radar systems are often not feasible for developing countries mainly due to economic and technological constraints le et al 2020 satgé et al 2020 limited availability of precipitation information is one of the factors that significantly restricts the accuracy of hydrological models cortés et al 2011 as a result several recent studies have focused on utilizing different precipitation datasets to support hydrological modeling in poorly gauged or ungauged catchments because of the low cost and high spatial coverage satellite based and reanalysis based estimates are among the most attractive approaches for obtaining continuous and spatially distributed precipitation datasets with high spatial and temporal resolutions to provide improved support for hydrological models amorim et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 algorithms to estimate precipitation from satellite observations are based on infrared radiation microwave radiation or a combination of the two the infrared sensors carried by geostationary earth orbiting satellites provide precipitation indirectly from the tops of clouds based on the relationship between the infrared cloud top temperature and the precipitation probability at the ground prigent 2010 in contrast microwave based estimates are based on the principle that precipitation at the surface is related to microwave emission from raindrops in low frequency channels and microwave scattering from ice at high frequency channels hong et al 2019 both passive radiometer and active radar microwave observations are currently available from satellites in low earth orbit reanalysis precipitation products have also become an attractive alternative source for hydrological applications the reanalysis based approach combines field observation data and climate model predictions using a data assimilation system to estimate surface precipitation lakew et al 2020 lockhoff et al 2019 although satellite and reanalysis based precipitation srp estimates provide precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolutions their performances are often constrained by estimation biases and errors yin et al 2021 advances in blending programs such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp have recently enabled integration of srp estimates with gauge observations to yield more reliable precipitation information for hydrological studies the srp products that are currently available to the public include precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks from climate data record persiann cdr hsu et al 1997 integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2007 climate prediction center morphing technique with corrected bias cmorph crt joyce et al 2004 and soil moisture to rain derived from the advanced scatterometer sm2rasc brocca et al 2014 the european center for medium range weather forecast ecmwf reanalysis 5th generation product era5 hersbach et al 2019 is among the reanalysis based precipitation datasets being used in a wide range of applications because of their indirect retrieval of precipitation values the srp products contain various sources of inherent error satellite precipitation estimates contain inevitable errors that result from sampling uncertainties and sensor shortcomings hussain et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the reanalysis precipitation products also contain significant uncertainties that arise from model errors and observation errors in the data assimilation system nie et al 2015 moreover the performance of srp products can vary between regions topographical conditions and products amjad et al 2020 wei et al 2017 therefore it is essential to quantitatively assess the quality of precipitation from different sources before using the data in hydrological and hydro climatic studies amjad et al 2020 to date some studies have been done to evaluate the performance of srp products and the effect of this performance on hydrological simulations amorim et al 2020 le et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wedajo et al 2021 the existing studies have mainly focused on evaluating a single product or a few products in some cases different versions of the same product e g wang et al 2017 su et al 2019 and for limited periods so their estimated errors may not reflect long term conditions moreover most of the studies were completed before the release of the latest versions of products such as era5 and imerg v06 hence there is a notable gap in the literature associated with evaluating the accuracy of multiple and long term srp products for hydrological simulations and this gap was an important motivation for the present study the specific aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the performance of srp products and their utility in hydrological modeling the study consists of two main parts 1 evaluating the performance of srp products against ground observations at different timescales and 2 assessing the hydrological utility of the srp products for simulating streamflow processes and states we hypothesized that the products we evaluated would differ in their performance within a given study area and that these differences would affect their ability to reliably support hydrological modeling 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the porijõgi catchment is located 5 10 km south of tartu estonia and lies between 26 32 e and 26 54 e and between 58 7 n and 58 17 n with an area of 258 km2 fig 1 the catchment is one of the tributaries of the emajõgi river which flows into lake peipsi a major part of the catchment is located on the otepää heights with a fragmented landscape mander et al 2010 agriculture and forest are the dominant land use types in the basin and cover 45 and 49 of the total area respectively mander et al 2000 the catchment is characterized by undulating topography with elevations ranging from 31 to 188 m above sea level a s l and a mean elevation of 95 8 m the upland soils are mainly podzoluvisols planosols and podzols with a loamy sand or fine sandy loam texture and a surface soil organic matter content of 1 6 1 9 kmoch et al 2021 peatlands and gleysols dominate the valleys and lower parts of the basin the mean annual temperature is 6 4 c with mean monthly temperatures ranging from 4 5 c in january to 18 3 c in july and the mean annual precipitation is 678 mm 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 gauge observations the hydrometeorological data required to evaluate the performance of the srp products and initialize hydrological simulation in the swat model discussed in section 2 3 2 were obtained from the estonian weather service database we used daily precipitation data from three stations i e tõravere piigaste and otepää fig 1 other necessary climate data were the daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the daily streamflow m3 s 1 records from 2007 to 2020 were obtained from the reola hydrological station at the outlet of the catchment 2 2 2 satellite based and reanalysis precipitation products we chose five srp products sm2rasc imerg persiann cdr era5 and cmorph crt that provided data from 2007 to 2020 for the performance evaluation basic information about these products is summarized in table s1 sm2rasc is a global scale precipitation product derived from soil moisture through the application of the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2019 it is a new product based on an innovative bottom up approach for retrieving precipitation from soil moisture observations based on the inversion of the hydrological water balance equation brocca et al 2013 while other satellite based instantaneous precipitation rates are estimated based on a top down approach the algorithm provides cumulative daily precipitation products we used the most recently released version 1 4 of sm2rasc with 0 1 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution imerg is an extension of trmm that provides an improved capability to measure light precipitation and snowfall huffman et al 2007 it uses inter calibrated estimates from the international constellation of satellites that provide precipitation relevant data and other data sources moazami and najafi 2021 imerg products are bias corrected using monthly precipitation reanalysis results from the global precipitation climate center gpcc fang et al 2019 we used the recently released v06 imerg product with 0 1 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution persiann cdr is the product of the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing and employs artificial neural networks to estimate precipitation rates from cloud top temperatures measured using gridded satellite infrared data gridsat b1 le et al 2020 the estimated precipitation is then adjusted using the gpcc monthly product wang et al 2017 we used the persiann cdr product with 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution era5 is the latest fifth generation global atmospheric reanalysis precipitation dataset developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf jiao et al 2021 era5 combines vast amounts of historical observations into global estimates using four dimensional variational data assimilation and modeling systems jiang et al 2021 we used the product with a spatial resolution of 0 75 and daily temporal resolution cmorph crt products are generated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center s cpc s morphing technique joyce et al 2004 the technique applies passive microwave sensors to estimate precipitation and uses infrared data to propagate the estimated products when no microwave data are available joyce et al 2004 this product uses the probability density function pdf matching technique for bias correction using the cpc daily data we used the most recent product version 1 0 of cmorph crt with 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution fig 2 presents the spatial distribution of the grid cells and daily precipitation intensities 21 august 2019 for our study area 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 evaluation of srp products we adopted a point to grid pairwise evaluation approach to assess the performance of the five products at each precipitation gauge station to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the products we used four continuous and three categorical metrics the continuous statistical metrics were pearson s correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse relative bias rb and mean absolute error mae the lower the rmse mae and rb and the higher the r the better the agreement between the srp product and the gauge observations the categorical metrics were the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi the higher the pod and csi and the lower the far the more reliable the performance of a product table s2 provides the equations used to calculate the statistical metrics we used to evaluate the srp products we calculated the categorical statistical metrics using a 2 2 contingency table table 1 for different daily precipitation threshold values to better understand the detection ability of the srp products at various levels of precipitation intensity using the categorical measures we arbitrarily classified the dominantly occurring precipitation events pr between 0 01 and 10 mm day into three intensity classes low pr 1 mm moderate 1 pr 5 mm and high 5 pr 10 mm we also used the pdf technique to quantify the occurrence frequency of daily precipitation in distinct intensity ranges pdf is the ratio of the frequency of occurrence in specific intervals to the overall number of events shen et al 2021 moreover we used a taylor diagram taylor 2001 to compare the products in terms of their r rmse and standard deviation 2 3 2 swat model and input data the soil and water assessment tool swat is a physical based semi distributed model that calculates daily and monthly hydrological balance parameters in a watershed arnold et al 1998 swat lets users modify the physical parameters to better represent the real conditions of the modeled watershed the model centers on the principle that the water balance equation is a proxy for all processes that occur in the watershed system araza et al 2021 sw sw 0 i 1 t r sr et p rf where sw is the final soil water content at time t sw 0 is the initial soil water content r is the amount of precipitation precipitation sr is surface runoff et is evapotranspiration p is percolation water that passes below the soil profile and rf is the groundwater return flow we used the merit digital elevation model dem yamazaki et al 2019 for elevation data the estonian topographic database estonian land board for land use data and the harmonized world soil database fischer et al 2008 for soil data fig 3 the hydrometeorological datasets used for model simulation are described in section 2 2 1 and table s3 we used version 1 1 of the qswat3 plug in for version 3 16 5 of the qgis software to set up the model and generate watershed networks subbasins and hydrologic response units hrus based on the dem we applied a drainage contributing area larger than a threshold of 5 km2 to discretize the watershed into 37 sub basins for discretizing hrus we considered a threshold parameter of 10 for land use soil and slope resulting in 357 hrus 2 3 3 model parameters and sensitivity analysis process based hydrological models like swat are generally characterized by a multitude of parameters because of spatial variability measurement errors and complexity in hydrological processes the values of many parameters are not exactly known holvoet et al 2005 a parameter sensitivity analysis provides insights on which parameters contribute most to the output variance due to input variability holvoet et al 2005 we performed an lh oat sensitivity analysis in swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup which combines the latin hypercube lh sampling and one factor at a time oat design techniques van griensven et al 2006 based on the swat input output documentation and previous studies abbaspour et al 2015 we selected 19 parameters to support a sensitivity analysis using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 in swat cup we found nine parameters table 2 with sufficient sensitivity for use in calibration and validation we defined the sensitivity by ranking the parameters in order of decreasing sensitivity then using pairwise t tests to identify pairs that differed significantly p 0 05 2 3 4 model calibration and validation the entire period of the simulation was from 1 january 2008 31 december 2019 the first two years 2008 and 2009 were used as a warm up period the next five years 2010 2014 and the last five years 2015 2019 were used for calibration and validation respectively the calibration process was carried out in two steps according to abbaspour et al 2017 parameters that introduce water into the system such as snow parameters and canopy storage parameters should be calibrated independently from other parameters and excluded from further calibration because they will cause identifiability problems therefore we performed the first calibration for seven snow and canopy storage related parameters and excluded them from further calibration after adjusting them and fixing them at their best values the second calibration was done for the main parameters indicated in table 2 sufi 2 is an interactive procedure that does not require many runs to attain a reasonable result abbaspour et al 2017 thus we performed 500 2000 simulations with 5 10 iterations until we achieved a reasonable nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse for validation we ran the model with the input parameters set during the calibration process 2 3 5 model performance evaluation the performance of the models in simulating the monthly streamflow was evaluated using nse as the objective function based on the recommendation by moriasi et al 2007 we divided the model performance into four categories unsatisfactory nse 0 50 satisfactory 0 50 nse 0 65 good 0 65 nse 0 75 and very good nse 0 75 we used the coefficient of determination r 2 the percent bias pbias the r factor and the p factor as complementary indicators in the performance evaluation p and r are measures of the uncertainty of the model prediction p indicates the fraction of the observed data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu and r implies the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu band and the standard deviation of the measured variable abbaspour et al 2015 table s4 summarizes the statistical metrics used to evaluate the performance of the swat model we evaluated the effect of each precipitation dataset on monthly streamflow simulation by developing six models one per spr product and one for the precipitation gauge data with all other swat inputs held constant the gauge simulated model was used as an evaluation benchmark fig 4 shows the workflow of our study 3 results 3 1 evaluation of srp products 3 1 1 daily evaluation the amount of the daily precipitation showed a similar distribution pattern across the three precipitation gauge stations fig 5a table s5 for all products more than 60 of precipitation fell within the low intensity range 1 mm day and the occurrence frequency decreased with increasing intensity fig 5b imerg era5 and persiann cdr slightly underestimated the occurrence frequency of low intensity precipitation and overestimated the next higher intensities in contrast cmorph crt and sm2rasc overestimated low intensity precipitation and underestimated the next higher intensity ranges we also evaluated the daily performance of the srp products using scatterplots and the continuous statistical metrics defined in section 2 3 1 fig s1 the results showed weak performance of the srp products on a daily scale with low correlation values r 0 22 0 39 and high deviation from the observed mean rb of 18 73 fig 6 presents the performance of the srp products according to the detection based indices the median values of pod and csi for all products at all intensity classes were less than 0 5 whereas the median values of far were greater than 0 5 except for imerg and era5 at low intensity indicating the low quality of srp products for detecting daily precipitation events in the study area the median values of pod and csi increased with increasing precipitation intensity whereas far decreased or did not change among the five srp products imerg and cmorph crt show the best or close to the best and the worst or close to the worst performance respectively more information on the detection capability of the srp products at various precipitation thresholds can be found in fig s2 3 1 2 monthly evaluation based on the monthly cumulative precipitation fig 7a all srp products followed a trend similar to the gauge observations and the slope of the curve increased with time however the products exhibited substantial divergence from the gauged precipitation with significant overestimation by imerg era5 and persiann cdr and significant underestimation by sm2rasc and cmorph crt the monthly mean precipitation from 2007 to 2020 fig 7b indicates that the maximum precipitation occurred during the summer months june to august which agrees with the results for all products the mean monthly precipitation for era5 imerg and persiann cdr agreed better with the gauged values with slight overestimation during the winter and autumn months but sm2rasc and cmorph crt exhibited substantial underestimation during the winter and spring months we used scatterplots and continuous statistical metrics fig 8 to further assess the agreement between the monthly srp products and the gauge observations imerg showed the best correlation with gauge observations r 0 84 followed by era5 r 0 74 the other srp datasets exhibited moderate r scores ranging from 0 61 to 0 70 overall increasing the temporal scale from daily to monthly resulted in a better correlation between the gauged and srp products the mae and rmse parameters supported these results 3 1 3 seasonal evaluation all products except sm2rasc showed the highest occurrence frequency 50 in the low intensity class 1 mm day in all seasons fig 9 the pdfs of imerg and era5 exhibited good performance at all precipitation intensities in contrast sm2rasc showed weaker agreement with gauge observations in all seasons with significant overestimation of the moderate intensity and significant underestimation of low and high intensities overall the srp products showed better performance in summer and weaker performance in winter in the taylor diagrams fig 10 the srp products closer to the gauge observations indicate better performance whereas the products lying below and above the reference line suggest lower and higher variability of the products relative to the gauge observations respectively nourani et al 2021 taylor 2001 all srp products showed the best performance in summer and the worst performance in winter imerg and era5 showed variability closest to that of the gauge observations in all seasons indicating the better performance of these products these two products also had better performance in terms of r with values ranging from 0 42 to 0 49 and 0 21 0 40 respectively 3 2 hydrological modeling sensitivity and uncertainty evaluation our results indicated that the model parameters cn2 esco alpha bnk and sol bd were the most sensitive parameters in all models and most strongly influenced streamflow in the study area the remaining five parameters gwqmn rchrg dp sol z sol awc and ch n2 were either still sensitive for some models or had no significant effect on streamflow simulations table s6 these parameters were the primary sources of uncertainty in streamflow simulation in the catchment fig 11 summarizes the uncertainty distribution for the nine parameters used for the streamflow simulations we have only shown the parameter uncertainty during the calibration period because we observed the same behavior during the validation period data not shown 3 3 streamflow simulation evaluation all precipitation products except sm2rasc and cmorph crt showed very good nse 0 75 and good 0 65 nse 0 75 performance for calibration and validation respectively fig 12 table 3 fig s3 although cmorph crt achieved satisfactory performance during the calibration period it was unsatisfactory during validation the sm2rasc model failed to achieve satisfactory performance for both calibration and validation nse 0 5 although most of the models underestimated the peak flows especially sm2rasc and cmorph crt they performed better in capturing the low flows fig 12 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the srp products all srp products exhibited low detection accuracies at a daily scale with low pod and csi values and a high far value the performance improved with increasing precipitation intensity the r values ranged from 0 22 to 0 39 which also indicates a poor correlation between the daily srp products and gauge observations however the monthly scale showed better performance with higher r values 0 61 0 84 and lower rmse values 21 35 mm month which agrees with the results of previous studies anjum et al 2019 ghozat et al 2021 several factors could explain this inconsistency between the daily and monthly performance the first relates to the gauge based information time step used to calibrate the srp products most of the srp products utilized in this study were calibrated using the gpcc precipitation data at a monthly scale which reduces monthly systematic errors but may not correctly capture the rapidly changing precipitation at time steps shorter than a month anjum et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 second this can be explained by the fact that the errors at the daily scale were nearly symmetrical fig s1 which could cancel each other after the aggregation liu et al 2015 it is worth mentioning that the low detection capability achieved by all srp products at the daily scale is also partly related to the precipitation intensity as reported in previous studies chen et al 2020 islam et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 both passive microwave and infrared sensors tend to detect high intensity precipitation events better and miss low intensities this is due to the higher signal to noise ratio and the favorable convective system particularly for microwave based measurements tan et al 2015 wu et al 2018 chen et al 2013 and satgé et al 2020 found that the better performance of srp products at higher intensity levels can be explained in three ways 1 rainfall collected during low intensity precipitation events that are correctly detected by infrared and passive microwave sensors might evaporate before they are recorded at the gauging stations 2 the gauges are not sufficiently sensitive to low intensity precipitation events and 3 the algorithms may be deficient the gauge observations used as ground truth values for performance evaluation are inherently subject to several errors related to wind effects and wetting evaporation losses peng et al 2020 therefore the effects of gauge observation uncertainties on evaluation performance cannot be neglected it has been widely reported lei et al 2021 tang et al 2018 tian et al 2018 that evaluating srp products using a high density of grid cells and gauging networks could enable more robust assessment results in the present study we used only three grid cells that corresponded to the three gauging stations in our study area which is likely to be a significant source of uncertainty all products except for sm2rasc tended to show better performance in summer and weaker performance in winter which is consistent with previous studies wei et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 we also observed relatively higher biases for the sm2rasc and cmorph crt products in winter and lower biases in summer data not shown chen et al 2019 suggested that the large bias for these products is closely related to the interference to passive microwave and advanced scatterometer ascat sensors created by precipitation sized ice particles or frozen surfaces the evaporation of low intensity precipitation before it reaches the land surface constitutes an additional factor that leads to the higher biases observed during the dry season beck et al 2017 the product comparison showed the best performance by imerg for all statistical indicators and all temporal scales previous studies also confirmed the superior performance of imerg in various parts of the world chen et al 2020 fang et al 2019 wei et al 2018 this can be attributed to the product s ability to integrate satellites and precipitation gauges combined with its higher spatial and temporal resolution unlike the other products imerg is also equipped with two sensors dual frequency precipitation radar and the gpm microwave imager that are highly sensitive to precipitation at a range of intensity levels chen et al 2020 tan and santo 2018 the sm2rasc and cmorph crt products showed the weakest agreement with gauge observations the inferior performance of sm2rasc is related to the weakness of the ascat sensor in terms of its lower ability to derive soil moisture variations when the surface moisture is nearly constant brocca et al 2014 2013 ciabatta et al 2015 the soils in the porijõgi catchment are more likely to experience saturation due to the frequent precipitation and relatively flat topography in such soils the soil moisture values remain roughly constant for any precipitation amount fereidoon et al 2019 in winter sm2rasc tends to underestimate precipitation at the low intensity and high intensity levels due to signal loss induced by the presence of spurious drizzle or noisy soil moisture brocca et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 the weaker performance of cmorph crt is possibly related to its dependence on a passive microwave sensor which is highly sensitive to the impacts of seasonal variability and has several problems associated with distinguishing between precipitation and frozen surfaces wei et al 2018 in general all srp products showed the best performance in summer and the worst performance in winter lei et al 2022 qin et al 2014 and tian et al 2009 also pointed out a seasonal difference in the performance of srp products with better performance in summer and weaker in winter these studies suggested that the poor performance of the products in winter is attributed to complex background emissivity from cold surface and snow cover subsequently producing high false precipitation events moreover kidd et al 2012 found that the failure of the satellites to accurately retrieve precipitation in winter is closely related to a greater occurrence of low intensity precipitation and the influence of frozen surface on passive microwave retrievals 4 2 hydrological modeling performance evaluation the srp products that performed well in precipitation validation also performed well in streamflow simulation the imerg model performed better than the other models including the gauge simulated model we attribute this strong performance to the generally high data quality and its ability to capture the spatial variability of precipitation in the catchment well in contrast the slightly weaker performance of the gauge simulated model is associated with the sparse and uneven distribution of the rainfall gauges which makes it difficult to accurately represent the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation goshime et al 2019 and wedajo et al 2021 also reported better performance of srp simulated monthly streamflow compared with gauge simulations in data scarce areas the models for the gauged imerg era5 and persiann cdr datasets slightly overestimated streamflow during the calibration period a negative pbias whereas sm2rasc and cmorph crt significantly underestimated the calibrated streamflow such disparities are mainly associated with the intrinsic variations in precipitation wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 our sensitivity analysis showed that cn2 esco alpha bnk and sol bd were the most sensitive parameters in all models suggesting that accurately assessing these parameters could significantly improve the model s ability to simulate monthly streamflow in the study area this finding agrees with previous studies leng et al 2020 singh and jha 2021 which found high sensitivity and a significant role of these parameters in maximizing model calibration accuracy cn2 lets the model govern the amount of surface runoff generated from each hru based on the relationship between precipitation the hydrologic soil group and land use donmez et al 2020 hence greater sensitivity of cn2 can be expected for most watersheds a high cn2 value indicates reduced infiltration whereas a low value corresponds to low surface runoff and high subsoil percolation donmez et al 2020 du et al 2020 our calibration results showed a 15 50 decrease in cn2 values for all models except sm2rasc and cmorph crt the initial value of cn2 in the models was 87 which is high for the land use and soil types in the study area therefore a large decrease in cn2 values can be attributed to the high initial cn2 values in the swat model raihan et al 2020 strauch et al 2012 moreover the low intensity precipitation physical soil properties and soil management practices in the study area might not be accurately reflected by the initial cn2 value thus leading to lower calibrated cn2 values decreasing cn2 improved the agreement between the measured and simulated hydrographs and increased infiltration which contributes to baseflow and recharge esco is used to modify the soil depth distribution needed to meet the evaporative demands of the water balance model therefore a change in esco affects the entire water balance component of the catchment cibin et al 2010 a lower esco value lets the model extract more of the evaporative demand from lower soil layers to compensate for a water deficit in upper layers malagò et al 2015 however a higher esco value represents increased baseflow tile drainage and surface runoff cibin et al 2010 according to arnold et al 2000 esco values between 0 75 and 1 0 are recommended however our results show that esco values lower than 0 6 tended to yield higher values of nse this indicates that soil water from deeper soil layers can be used to meet the evaporative demand a lower value of esco for the gauge simulated model than for the srp driven simulations suggests that the evapotranspiration demand is higher in the gauged simulation sol bd is closely related to soil infiltration and defines the relative amount of pore space in each soil layer odusanya et al 2021 the initial infiltration rate of the soil decreases with increasing bulk density leng et al 2020 li et al 2009 the high sensitivity of sol bd in the present study suggests that the lateral and vertical movement of water in the soil layers of the catchment significantly affected hydrological processes leng et al 2020 our calibration results indicated a small but significant tendency to increase sol bd values across the catchment by 5 15 leading to lower soil porosity in the model about 66 of the catchment is covered by histosols which are composed mainly of organic materials eagle and olander 2012 this originally leads to very low sol bd values in the catchment however the harmonized world soil database soil data provides the same numerical input values for most of the catchment area such as sol bd values of 1 6 mg cm3 and the same soil hydrological group d high runoff potential low infiltration rate neitsch et al 2011 which does not reflect the diversity of soils in the catchment in addition hydraulic conductivity k 6 793 and soil organic carbon soc 0 83 in the topsoil versus k 2 4265 and soc 0 28 in the subsoil and these values can only serve as proxies for the abundance of peatland and wetlands in the catchment alpha bnk characterizes the bank storage recession curve a large value approximately 1 indicates a smooth recession whereas a low value approximately 0 indicates a steep recession arnold et al 2013 our findings revealed alpha bnk values less than 0 4 for most of the models such tendencies towards smaller alpha bnk values means an increased movement of a substantial portion of bank storage into the adjacent unsaturated zones especially during the water deficient periods doble et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 the maximum canopy storage canmx parameter which we calibrated in the initial stage and excluded from further calibration was sensitive for all models canmx represents the maximum amount of precipitation that can be trapped in the canopy when the canopy is fully developed and plays an important role in the hydrological cycle of humid temperate regions arnold et al 2013 li et al 2021 our results showed a calibrated value of canmx ranging from 51 mm gauged model to 69 mm imerg model indicating that the vegetation canopies in the catchment retain more precipitation and allow for higher vegetation evapotranspiration li et al 2021 sol awc represents the available water capacity in soil layers a higher value of sol awc means a higher capacity of soils to hold water and less water availability for surface runoff and percolation our results showed up to a 40 decrease in sol awc values suggesting a reduced ability of the soil to hold water and a subsequent increase in the surface runoff and streamflow the high tendency of all models to extract water from lower soil layers i e low esco values could be attributed to a low water holding capacity of the soils in the catchment ch n2 which represents the main streamflow channel in the watershed system also had a strong impact on the performance of our models we found that the values of ch n2 ranging from 0 06 to 0 18 tended to yield greater nse values the values of ch n2 in our study were higher than the values in previous research and this indicates that the main channel in the study area is a natural stream with heavy brush surrounding the channel arnold et al 2013 this is a reasonable interpretation given the ecological environment in the catchment the hydrological parameters that were less sensitive or not significantly sensitive in the models were mainly groundwater parameters such as the depth of water for return flow gwqmn the deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf the groundwater delay time gw delay and the groundwater revap coefficient gw revap this indicates that groundwater interactions and fluxes related to these parameters have less effect on streamflow in the catchment dakhlalla and parajuli 2019 in distributed models like swat parameter sensitivity and uncertainty are strongly influenced by parameter interdependence and the nonlinear response of predictions to parameter changes which is referred to as parameter equifinality beven and binley 1992 the changes in some of the parameters may be compensated for by changes in others leading to different parameter sets that produce the same simulated results thus the uncertainties of some parameters observed in our models are likely to have been caused by the tradeoff effects between the parameters 5 conclusions the variation among the five srp products in their ability to estimate precipitation and the consequences for hydrological simulation accuracy confirmed our research hypotheses although none of the srp products provided high quality precipitation estimates at a daily scale most provided satisfactory performance at a monthly scale we also observed large discrepancies in the performance of the srp products between the different precipitation intensity classes our comparison among the five srp products at a daily scale showed particularly low performance for the sm2rasc and cmorph crt data and better performance for the imerg era5 and persiann cdr data the inferior performance of sm2rasc was related to the weakness of the ascat sensor s ability to derive soil moisture variations when the surface moisture is relatively constant whereas the limitations of cmorph crt were related to the weakness of the ability of the passive microwave sensors to correctly estimate precipitation we evaluated the performance of the precipitation products for streamflow simulation at a monthly scale using swat cup imerg performed best and cmorph crt performed worst among the selected products in both the statistical evaluations and the streamflow simulations we also observed that the optimal values for most parameters differed significantly among the models this shows a high degree of parameter uncertainty when different precipitation datasets are utilized our results confirmed a direct and significant impact of precipitation on the performance of streamflow simulations the sensitivity analysis showed that cn2 esco alpha bnk and sol bd were the most sensitive parameters for all models however other hydrological parameters related to groundwater gwqmn and rchrg dp the main channel ch n2 and the soil sol awc and sol z were less sensitive or had no significant effect on streamflow simulations for most of the models overall our results provide useful information about the application of srp products in streamflow simulation in data scarce areas at the basin scale since this study is the first attempt in estonia the best performance by imerg suggests the potential usefulness of this product for hydrological modeling applications the approach we described can also help researchers and managers identify suitable srp products that can be used in other basins along with the efforts to improve the srp products it will be important to develop more effective daily scale bias adjustment techniques credit authorship contribution statement evelyn uuemaa conceptualization resources supervision
