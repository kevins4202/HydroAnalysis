8610,the impact of drying and temperature on the reduction of escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in stormwater bioretention systems with and without a submerged zone was assessed using 16 pilot scale bioretention columns under controlled laboratory conditions the experimental design enabled analysis of possible interactions between the factors first outflow and event based samples were collected outflow concentrations were independent of inflow concentrations and hence controlled by internal processes overall tss removal was high but sensitive to bacterial synthesis event based samples had significantly higher bacteria concentrations than first outflow samples suggesting that remaining surviving bacteria in the bioretention cells have little effect on initial peak outflow concentrations the effect of temperature varied between bacterial species and sample types long dry periods seemed beneficial for bacteria reduction but outflow bacteria concentrations peaked during the second watering after long dry periods submerged zones significantly reduced bacteria outflow concentrations however sudden temperature increases caused bioretention cells with a submerged zone to produce significantly higher bacteria outflow concentrations than before the temperature increase which was not the case for standard cells bioretention cells with submerged zones may thus be poor choices for reducing bacterial concentrations in stormwater runoff in areas experiencing winter conditions finally our results suggest that adsorption e g further enhanced by biofilm formation is the major mechanism governing bacteria reduction in bioretention systems keywords bacteria submerged zone stormwater bioretention winter performance wet and dry periods 1 introduction pathogens are found in urban stormwater runoff in all climates and geographical locations and both snow and sediment are considered non point sources of microbial pollution in urban stormwater runoff makepeace et al 1995 microorganism concentrations exhibit significant seasonal variation and are usually lowest during winter selvakumar and borst 2006 however most microorganisms can adapt to temperature changes and or enter dormancy to overcome unfavorable environmental conditions jones and lennon 2010 pathogenic bacteria transported in urban stormwater runoff can be hazardous to human health if stormwater is discharged into recreational waters and or water bodies used for drinking water supply or encounters shellfish beds strassler et al 1999 kloss 2008 epidemiological studies have linked waterborne illnesses to recreational waters receiving urban stormwater runoff haile et al 1999 these issues make it desirable to remove bacteria from urban stormwater runoff one technology for this purpose is stormwater bioretention which provides stormwater quality control by exploiting the chemical biological and physical properties of plants microbes and filter materials reductions in bacterial concentrations achieved in field scale bioretention facilities vary between facilities designs and bacterial species most studies in this area have focused on fecal coliforms and or e coli for which the reported log reductions range from 1 26 to 1 44 passeport et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 and 1 48 and 2 14 chandrasena et al 2016 hathaway et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 respectively laboratory and pilot scale studies have also yielded highly variable e coli log reductions ranging from 1 91 to 4 32 chandrasena et al 2012 chandrasena et al 2014 kim et al 2012 li et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 additionally li and davis 2009 observed differing median event mean concentration emc reductions for e coli 0 01 and 1 06 and fecal coliforms 0 32 and 0 6 in two different bioretention cells fewer studies have examined other bacterial species average log reductions of 0 003 and 0 98 were reported for enterococci in two bioretention cells hathaway et al 2011 and log reductions of 0 88 and 0 98 were measured for campylobacter at two facilities chandrasena et al 2016 another study reported highly efficient removal in excess of 3 log of c perfringens and f rna coliphages li et al 2012 various factors and design modifications have been shown to affect bacteria removal in bioretention one such modification originally developed to promote nitrogen removal is the inclusion of a submerged zone with a cellulose based carbon source szc in the lower part of the filter kim et al 2003 the szc has a significantly beneficial effect on e coli reduction chandrasena et al 2014 li et al 2012 and vegetation plays an important role in reducing bacterial loads by bioretention chandrasena et al 2014 kim et al 2012 overall bacteria e coli reduction improves as bioretention systems age chandrasena et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 and chandrasena et al 2014 and li et al 2012 showed that antecedent drying for up to 2 5 weeks decreased e coli reduction significantly however there is no consensus regarding possible dependency of bacteria reduction on inflow concentrations chandrasena et al 2012 li et al 2012 finally a low temperature 5 c favored the survival of e coli so bacterial survival can be expected to increase with decreasing temperature zhang et al 2012 most of the above mentioned studies focused on the commonly used indicator bacterium e coli efforts to evaluate the presence of harmful pathogens in stormwater runoff commonly use e coli and e faecalis as indicator bacteria strassler et al 1999 consequently these species were also examined in this work however stormwater sometimes has high concentrations of bacteria and other pathogenic microorganisms of non human and non enteric origin so measurements of fecal indicator species alone may be insufficient for accurate assessments of health risks o shea and field 1992 furthermore the shape stevik et al 2004 and or motility vater et al 2014 of bacteria may affect their reduction a non enteric bacterium was therefore included in our assessments based on a thorough examination of the literature p aeruginosa was selected p aeruginosa is an opportunistic non enteric pathogen that can survive for several days in water with no low nutrient content makepeace et al 1995 it is ubiquitous in water systems lutz and lee 2011 and is commonly associated with human illness mena and gerba 2009 among other things it is the primary cause of ear infections in swimmers otitis externa lutz and lee 2011 and a well established cause of ear and or skin infections in healthy non compromised hosts mena and gerba 2009 urban run off is thought to be a source of p aeruginosa mena and gerba 2009 and some consider its presence to be an indicator of contamination from surface runoff warburton et al 1994 despite a growing number of studies on the performance of bioretention systems microbial dynamics in bioretention cells are poorly understood chandrasena et al 2017 many studies on the environmental conditions and design parameters affecting bacteria reduction in such systems see above have examined individual factors in isolation only a few studies have evaluated the combined effects and interactions of multiple two factors e g chandrasena et al 2014 li et al 2012 to our knowledge the effect of seasonal variation in temperature in relation to the presence of a szc and intermittent dry periods has not been systematically evaluated under controlled conditions therefore the objective of this study was to examine the effects of environmental conditions antecedent drying and temperature bioretention system design szc and their potential interactions on indicator bacteria reduction to this end the reduction of e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa in pilot scale bioretention columns brcs with and without submerged zones was studied under controlled laboratory conditions at two different temperatures 2 and 25 c with dry periods of 2 37 days this was followed by a study on the effect of a temperature increase from 2 to 25 c on bacteria reduction to characterize the effects of these variables in the brcs between inflow events two subsamples were collected during each event the first liter of outflow the first outflow sample and 1 l of the remaining outflow the event based sample three bacterial species e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa were examined to gain a broader perspective than would be obtained by focusing solely on e coli 2 methods 2 1 experimental set up sixteen pilot scale brcs constructed from pvc pipes diameter 380 mm height 900 mm with sandblasted inner walls to prevent preferential flow were used in the experiments the columns had a ponding zone made of transparent plexiglas height 400 mm to provide light for plant growth the filter material consisted of four layers top filter layer height 400 mm 5 5 5 2 3 mixture of 0 2 0 5 mm dried sand 0 5 1 0 mm dried sand 1 0 2 0 mm dried sand 2 0 4 0 mm dried sand and topsoil d50 0

spruce wood shavings mixed randomly into the bottom layer corresponding to a soil organic matter content of 1 the brc design is summarized in fig s1 each brc was planted with nine native wet drought tolerant plants 82plants m2 adapted to nordic climates three plants each of juncus conglomeratus phalaris arundinacea and carex panacea after planting the columns were stored outside and watered twice weekly with unchlorinated tap water for three months half of the columns of each type were then placed in an indoor greenhouse and the other half were placed in a refrigerated container both environments had near constant air temperatures 25 1 0 3 c and 1 5 0 3 c ebro ebi310 temperature logger to ensure continuous plant growth after the columns were moved inside they were illuminated with high pressure sodium greenhouse lamps g power agro 400 w 55 000 lm for 12 h daily the columns were watered with unchlorinated tap water for another three months before stormwater dosing started 2 2 experimental procedures the experiment was divided into two parts with durations of 120 and 22 days fig 1 part 1 consisted of wet periods where the brcs were watered twice weekly with 15 l of semi synthetic stormwater and three dry periods of 6 17 and 37 days outflow water was sampled before a dry period and on the first and second waterings after a dry period part 2 was only performed using the brcs in the refrigerated container after sampling run 9 the temperature in the container was increased from 1 5c to 25 3c 0 4 c and allowed to adjust for a week during this period the brcs were continuously watered with 15 l of semi synthetic stormwater twice weekly and outflow samples were collected on days 128 135 and 142 fig 1 illustrates the experimental schedule 2 3 stormwater preparation semi synthetic stormwater was prepared 24 h before each dosing by adding 200 mg l natural stormwater sediment originating from a stormwater gully pot to 190 l of tap water to ensure homogeneity the water was continuously mixed nonpathogenic strains of e coli culti loops escherichia coli atcc 11775 thermo scientific e faecalis culti loops enterococcus faecaslis atcc 29212 thermo scientific and p aeruginosa culti loops pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145 thermo scientific were cultivated in trypton soya broth tsb oxoid tv 5002e lot 1429272 at 37 c for 24 h then 5 ml of each bacterial suspension was added to the stormwater 30 min before dosing the stormwater inflow characteristics are summarized in table 1 2 4 sampling at each dosing event a grab sample of one liter of inflow was collected in sterile pe bottles at each temperature immediately before watering began the first liter of outflow subsequently referred to as first outflow was collected in a sterile 1 l pe bottle allmost all of the subsequent outflow was collected in sterile 20 l pe buckets washed in 100 ethanol immediately before watering the columns were allowed to drain for approximately three hours so that only a minor proportion of the inflow water was retained in the columns a 1 l sub sample of this collected outflow was then collected in a sterile pe bottle these subsamples are henceforth referred to as event based samples while stirring the collected water samples were transported directly to a refrigerator 4 6 c and stored until analysis which was performed within two hours of sample collection samples were removed from the refrigerator one at a time 2 5 analytical methods all samples were analyzed for tss ph e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa tss was determined by filtration through whatman gf a 1 6 µm pore size glass microfibre filters ss en 872 2005 in one replicate ph was measured with a field ph meter ph330 wtw gmbh weilheim germany e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa were enumerated using colilert enterolert e and pseudalert test kits respectively and quantified using quanti tray 2000 idexx europe b v netherlands sample dilutions were performed when needed to adequately quantify bacteria concentrations the detection limits for all three methods are 1 cfu per 100 ml sample within 24 h blank tests using colilert the enterolert e test kit and the pseudalert test kit showed an absence of analyzed parameters 2 6 data analysis bacteria concentrations below the detection limit which occurred in 1 event based sample for e faecalis 19 first outflow samples for p aeruginosa and 8 event based samples for p aeruginosa were recorded as half of the detection limit bacteria concentrations too numerous to count which occurred in 11 first outflow and 13 event based samples for e coli 1 first outflow sample for p aeruginosa and 2 event based samples for p aeruginosa were excluded from subsequent analyses for tss analysis a 500 ml subsample was filtered 1 6 µm giving a detection limit of 4 mg l all tss results 4 mg l 129 samples were recorded as half of the detection limit the total number of samples per pollutant was 168 the normality of the data was tested by performing an individual distribution identification anderson darling test and goodness of fit test inflow series and outflow ph were found to be normally distributed bacteria and tss outflow concentrations were non normally distributed hence non parametric tests were used for comparisons involving non normally distributed datasets average bacteria concentrations are reported as geometric means and are plotted as logarithmic log10 values or with logarithmic y axes due to the large numbers involved reductions are expressed as log10 reduction values lrv i e log10 final concentration initial concentration to account for the standing water in brcs having a szc estimated to be approximately 20 l based on a filter material porosity of 0 4 and assuming plug flow log10 reduction values were calculated using inflow values from the previous watering for columns with a szc and inflow values from the same day for columns with no szc one way anova followed by tukey s test was used to determine whether the inflow concentrations differed between the two studied temperatures 1 5 c and 25 1 c the inflow ph and outflow ph at the two temperatures were compared using paired t tests spearman s rank correlation tests were performed to evaluate correlations between tss and bacteria levels in the inflow and outflow and between tss removal and bacterial lrvs this test was also used to evaluate correlations between inflow and outflow concentrations and between outflow concentrations of different species pearsońs correlation test was used to evaluate correlations between bacterial log10 reductions for first outflow and event based samples since no correlation was found between in and outflow concentrations these were compared using mood s median test despite the lack of independence first outflow and event based concentrations for individual bacterial species were compared using the wilcoxon signed rank test paired t tests were performed to determine whether log10 reductions differed between first outflow and event based samples log10 reductions for brcs with and without a szc at 25 1 c and 1 5 c neglecting antecedent drying were compared using one way anovas followed by tukey s test general linear models glm were run to examine the main effects of varying temperature brc designs with and without a szc varying lengths of antecedent dry days and their interactions on both outflow concentrations and log10 reductions main effect plots and interaction plots see supporting information were created to illustrate the observed effects and interactions of the glm because of their non normal distributions outflow concentrations were box cox transformed prior to analysis the kruskal wallis test was used to determine whether outflow concentrations before the temperature increase differed from those afterwards if a significant difference was found a mann whitney test was performed for all statistical tests significance was accepted at an α level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 inflow and outflow characteristics e coli inflow concentrations were significantly higher than e faecalis and p aeruginosa inflow concentrations at both temperatures and the inflow concentrations of the latter two species did not differ significantly at either temperature table 1 additionally the inflow concentrations of both e faecalis and p aeruginosa differed significantly between the two temperatures this indicates that e faecalis and p aeruginosa are more sensitive to temperature than e coli differences in inflow concentrations between species were expected due to their different living conditions and nutritional demands as well as interspecies competition no correlations spearman s rank between in and outflow concentrations were found for any bacterial species in either first outflow or event based samples separate tests were performed for non szc and szc columns the variation in the outflow concentrations was thus attributable to the studied factors rather than the relatively constant inflow concentrations previous field studies chandrasena et al 2016 li et al 2012 found positive correlations between in and outflow bacteria concentrations indicating that the studied bioretention systems had only limited capacities for bacterial retention this was attributed to the pronounced variation in the composition of real inflowing stormwater all inflow concentrations and ph values were significantly higher mood s median test than the corresponding outflow concentrations and ph values additionally event based samples had significantly higher concentrations of all three bacterial species than first outflow samples wilcoxon signed rank test fig 4 indicating that bacterial outflow concentrations do not peak during the first outflow this resulted in significant lrv differences with the lrvs of first outflow samples generally being higher than those of event based samples fig 3 this difference shows that relatively large variations can occur during single outflow events which are not fully captured by simply evaluating event mean concentrations the latter further suggests that remaining surviving bacteria in bioretention systems should not cause problematic initial peak outflow concentrations furthermore tss did not correlate with the concentrations of any bacterial species in the inflow or outflow this was expected since previous studies found the majority of e coli cells to exist in free suspension fries et al 2006 chandrasena et al 2012 and other studies found poor or no correlations between indicator bacteria concentrations and tss in urban stormwater runoff mccarthy et al 2012 galfi et al 2016 bacterial survival is sensitive to ph madigan et al 1997 extremely low or high ph conditions may strongly inactivate microbes but die off rates are low at neutral ph madigan et al 1997 although the ph was significantly lower in the outflow than the inflow at both temperatures ph did not affect the observed brc bacteria reductions because both the inflow ph 7 18 7 39 independently of temperature and outflow ph 6 13 7 39 independently of temperature and brc design were within the neutral range the latter result is consistent with an earlier study jewett et al 1995 that found bacterial transport to be ph independent at ph values between 5 5 and 7 0 3 2 total suspended solids tss removal was always above 95 for brcs with no szc and columns with a szc at 1 5 c fig 3 however at 25 1 c brcs with a szc had poor removal fig 3 resulting in significantly elevated tss outflow concentrations fig 2 this may be because the measured tss is excreted alginate a reddish brown powder produced by p aeruginosa to protect itself from adverse surroundings and enhance adhesion to solid surfaces boyd and chakrabarty 1995 this hypothesis is supported by the brownish red coloration of the tss obtained from brcs with a szc at 25 1 c and the significant effect of the temp szc interaction table 2 s1 no such effect of the presence of szc on tss removal was observed in earlier studies on stormwater bioretention that did not include p aeruginosa e g blecken et al 2009a b søberg et al 2017 similarly no effect of the presence of a szc on tss removal was observed at 1 5 c probably because micro biological processes are retarded at lower temperatures and so the outflow was free of alginate 3 3 escherichia coli independently of the studied factors and design configuration the lrv for e coli ranged from 1 33 to 6 66 and 0 2 to 4 32 for first outflow and event based samples respectively fig 3 with arithmetic means of 2 98 and 1 59 the average event based lrvs for brcs with no szc 0 73 and 0 99 at 1 5 and 25 1 c respectively for all lengths of antecedent dry days agreed well with previously reported average lrvs for brcs with no szc e g chandrasena et al 2014 kim et al 2012 likewise the event based lrvs for brcs with a szc 2 63 and 2 05 at 1 5 and 25 1 c respectively were similar to previously reported values for such systems chandrasena et al 2014 li et al 2012 conversely chandrasena et al 2016 reported a lrv of 1 23 for a field scale bioretention facility with a 200 mm deep szc this may have been due to challenging operational conditions at that specific facility first outflow samples had significantly higher average lrvs 2 45 and 3 04 with no szc and 2 98 and 3 43 with a szc at 1 5 and 25 1 c respectively than event based samples so their lrvs were higher than those reported previously for bioretention systems independently of their design e g chandrasena et al 2016 hathaway et al 2011 kim et al 2012 however previous studies did not measure first outflow separately making direct comparisons impossible the szc temperature and length of prior drying had significant effects on e coli reduction in the brcs table 2 s1 the inclusion of a szc was beneficial for e coli reduction table 2 s1 the latter has been shown previously chandrasena et al 2014 li et al 2012 increasing the number of antecedent dry days reduced e coli outflow concentrations significantly table 2 s1 so longer dry periods significantly increased lrvs table 2 s1 conversely chandrasena et al 2014 and li et al 2012 found that antecedent dry days had a significant negative effect on e coli reduction however the drying periods they examined did not exceed 2 5 weeks zhang et al 2011 examined the long term performance of bacteria removal in brcs incorporating some drying in the experimental setup their columns were watered once every second week for 18 months resulting in antecedent drying periods of 13 days however because of the constant dry period duration drying was not incorporated as a factor in their experiment temperature had opposite effects on e coli outflow concentrations for event based samples and first outflow samples table 2 s1 for first outflow samples e coli concentrations were significantly lower so the corresponding lrvs were higher at the warmer temperature whereas the opposite applied for event based samples table 2 s1 e coli is an intestinal bacterium so its optimum growth temperature is 37 c its growth rate increases with temperature from 21 to 37 c but declines outside this range neidhardt 1996 e coli growth was therefore expected to be higher at 25 1 c than at 1 5 c leading to higher outflow concentrations and lower lrvs at the higher temperature which was also the case for event based samples whereas the opposite was observed for first outflow samples zhang et al 2012 found temperature to have no significant influence on e coli transport and capture in conventional bioretention media but concluded that bacterial survival could be expected to increase with decreasing temperature this may be why the outflow concentrations in first outflow samples at 1 5 c were higher than at 25 1 c more bacterial cells survived at the lower temperature and when the brcs were re watered these surviving bacterial cells were rapidly transported out of the brc the temp szc interaction significantly affected outflow concentrations and event based lrvs table 2 interaction plots fig s2a b revealed that the differences in outflow concentrations and event based lrvs between brcs with and without a szc were smallest at 25 1 c for brcs with a szc at 1 5 c event based samples had lower outflow concentrations and higher lrvs than first outflow samples conversely for brcs with a szc at 25 1 c first outflow samples had lower outflow concentrations than event based samples the beneficial effect of a szc is thus more pronounced at 1 5 c furthermore a szc evens out variation in outflow concentrations and lrvs resulting from different lengths of antecedent dry days and significantly increases lrvs in cases with long antecedent dry periods table 2 s1 the temperature increase from 1 5 c to 25 3 c implemented in the second part of the experiment was expected to increase e coli outflow concentrations as discussed previously as expected the outflow concentrations from brcs with a szc were significantly higher after the temperature increase than before table 3 fig 4 however no significant effect was observed for brcs without a szc table 3 fig 4 this may be because brcs with a szc offer more favorable conditions for bacteria due to permanent water availability and low temperatures promote bacterial dormancy then when the temperature increases and conditions become more supportive of bacterial growth the e coli concentration increases rapidly leading to increased outflow concentrations 3 4 enterococcus faecalis independently of the studied factors and brc design configuration the lrvs for e faecalis ranged from 1 49 to 5 77 and 0 02 6 47 for first outflow and event based samples respectively with arithmetic means of 3 38 and 1 91 fig 3 the reduction of e faecalis in stormwater bioretention systems has not previously been examined however hathaway et al 2011 measured the reduction of enterococci from natural stormwater in two field scale bioretention facilities during different seasons and reported average lrvs of 0 003 for a shallow bioretention system 25 cm filter depth and 0 98 for a deeper facility 60 cm filter depth since e faecalis belongs to the genus enterococci and resembles other members of the genus in terms of morphology and nutritional requirements comparable reductions were expected in this study the average lrv of e faecalis for brcs without a szc at 25 1 c when not considering temperature and antecedent dry days was 1 16 this value is comparable to that reported by hathaway et al 2011 for a deep system that resembles our columns shallower systems performed worse kadam et al 2008 obtained lrvs of 2 11 1 22 and 2 44 for the reduction of e faecalis from municipal wastewater in three 70 cm deep soil filters despite differences in design and inflow water composition between the studied systems these results are comparable to those obtained for event based samples in this work brcs with a szc had significantly lower e faecalis outflow concentrations and thus higher lrvs than those without a szc table 2 s1 long drying periods had similar effects table 2 s1 as for e coli temperature had opposite effects on e faecalis outflow concentrations for event based samples and first outflow samples table 2 s1 for first outflow samples e faecalis concentrations were significantly lower so the corresponding lrvs were higher at the warmer temperature whereas the opposite applied for event based samples table 2 s1 e faecalis outflow concentrations was expected to be higher at high temperature as was the case for event based samples since e faecalis grows very slowly at 7 c and grows optimally at 37 c garcía de fernando et al 1991 1 5 c is on the low end of its temperature growth range and permits only minimal growth the observed higher outflow concentrations of e faecalis at low temperature for first outflow samples is probably explained by the same reasons as previously discussed for e coli the temp szc interaction had a significant effect on e faecalis outflow concentrations and lrvs for both first outflow and event based samples table 2 s1 interaction plots figure s3a b revealed that the differences in outflow concentrations and lrvs between brcs with and without a szc were smaller at 25 1 c than at 1 5 c however for brcs with a szc the lowest outflow concentrations and highest lrvs were observed in event based samples at 1 5 c and in first outflow samples at 25 1 c in systems with a szc longer dry periods significantly increased the lrvs of event based samples table 2 s1 however the presence of a szc evened out variation associated with dry periods of different durations conversely longer dry periods reduced outflow concentrations and thus increased the lrvs of first outflow samples table 2 s1 the presence of a szc enhanced the latter effect the temp add antecedent dry days interaction was not significant for event based samples but had a significant effect on both outflow concentrations and lrvs for first outflow samples table 2 short dry periods 2 or 3 days gave higher outflow concentrations at 25 1 c but intermediate length dry periods 4 6 or 17 days gave higher outflow concentrations at 1 5 c table s1 temperature had no detectable effect on outflow concentrations after 37 antecedent dry days fig s2a table s1 the lrvs for first outflow samples after short dry periods 2 or 3 days and long 37 days dry periods were temperature independent but were higher at 25 1 c than at 1 5 c after intermediate length dry periods 4 17 days table s1 the temperature increase from 1 5 c to 25 3 c was expected to increase e faecalis outflow concentrations for the same reasons as for e coli this expectation was validated for brcs with a szc table 3 fig 4 but no significant differences were found for brcs without a szc table 3 fig 4 potential explanations for the latter result are discussed in section 3 3 3 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa independently of the studied factors and design configuration the lrvs for p aeruginosa ranged from 0 94 to 6 57 and 0 47 to 6 55 for first outflow and event based samples respectively fig 3 with arithmetic means of 4 12 and 2 47 p aeruginosa reduction in stormwater bioretention systems has not been evaluated before however a study on pathogen removal from municipal wastewater in three constructed soil filters with filter depths of 70 cm found average lrvs for p aeruginosa of 1 64 1 88 and 1 37 kadam et al 2008 despite differences between the examined filters the results of kadam et al 2008 are in the same range as the lrvs for event based samples obtained in this work brcs with a szc had significantly lower outflow concentrations and thus higher lrvs of p aeruginosa than those with no szc only significant for event based samples table 2 s1 longer drying periods reduced outflow concentrations table 2 s1 and hence had a significant increasing effect on lrv table 2 s1 temperature had a significant effect on both event based and first outflow samples table 2 with significantly higher outflow concentrations and lower lrvs at the warmer temperature fig 3 table 2 s1 the latter observation was expected since p aeruginosa grows between 4 and 42 c with optimum growth at 37 c labauve and wargo 2005 its growth should thus be disfavored below 4 c despite this expected limitation the outflow concentrations of p aeruginosa at 1 5 c ranged from 0 5 to 24 499 mpn ml the temp add antecedent dry days interaction had no significant effect on lrvs for first outflow or event based samples table 2 however it did significantly decrease outflow concentrations for both sample types table 2 s1 interaction plots fig s4a b revealed that antecedent dry days had no effect at 1 5 c since no variations in outflow concentration existed the latter further supports the previously discussed effect of temperature on p aeruginosa however at 25 1 c longer drying periods yielded lower outflow concentrations which is consistent with the observations for e coli and e faecalis the add antecedent dry days szc interaction had a significant effect on both lrv and outflow concentrations table 2 for first outflow concentrations no difference existed between brcs with and without a szc but lrv varied in between both design and length of antecedent dry days fig s4a b for event based samples the presence of a szc evened out variations in outflow concentration caused by the different lengths of antecedent dry days and reduced outflow concentrations relative to those seen for brcs with no szc the presence of a szc also increased the lrvs for p aeruginosa but had no effect on the variation in lrv caused by different lengths of antecedent dry days the temp szc interaction had significant effects on lrvs and outflow concentrations for both designs table 2 for first outflow samples p aeruginosa outflow concentrations in brcs with and without a szc did not differ significantly at 1 5 c however at 25 1 c brcs with a szc yielded higher outflow concentrations than those with no szc table s1 the lrvs for brcs with and without a szc did not differ significantly at 25 1 c and were lower than those at 1 5 c additionally the presence of a szc resulted in higher lrvs at the lower temperature the opposite was observed for event based samples brcs with and without a szc had identical outflow concentrations at 1 5 c but at 25 1 c brcs with a szc had lower outflow concentrations than those without the presence of a szc reduced event based lrvs at both temperatures but this effect was most pronounced at 1 5 c no general conclusions can be readily drawn from the observed two way interactions for p aeruginosa however the outflow concentrations and lrvs for this species are clearly more sensitive to temperature than to variation in dry period duration or the presence of a szc this hypothesis is supported by the results obtained upon raising the temperature from 1 5 c to 25 3 c the outflow concentrations after the temperature increase were always significantly higher than before table 3 fig 4 the insensitivity of this effect to the presence of a szc or the number of antecedent dry days indicates that temperature governs p aeruginosa behavior rather than brc design and or dry period duration 3 6 correlations between bacterial species outflow concentrations of e coli and e faecalis correlated well with spearman s rank correlation coefficients r s of 0 89 and 0 84 for first outflow and event based samples respectively for first outflow samples no correlation between e coli and p aeruginosa r s 0 3 and e faecalis and p aeruginosa r s 0 26 existed however for event based samples moderately strong correlations between e coli and p aeruginosa r s 0 58 and e faecalis and p aeruginosa r s 0 61 were found despite their different origins in nature in addition the log10 reductions of e coli and e faecalis correlated well with pearson correlation coefficients r of 0 83 and 0 84 for first outflow and event based samples respectively there were no detectable correlations between the log10 reductions of e coli and p aeruginosa r 0 34 or e faecalis and p aeruginosa r 0 35 based on first outflow samples however analyses of event based samples revealed good correlations between the log10 reductions of e coli and p aeruginosa r 0 72 and e faecalis and p aeruginosa r 0 75 the relatively strong correlations between the bacterial species seen with event based samples support the use of the indicator bacteria e coli and e faecalis in contrast the lack of between species correlations in first outflow samples suggests that bacterial species with a diverse range of origins should be considered when evaluating bacteria reduction in stormwater bioretention systems instead of relying solely on e coli this conclusion inconsistent with the results of chandrasena et al 2016 who found no correlation between the log reductions of e coli and campylobacter spp based on event mean samples 3 7 possible retention mechanisms in porous media bacteria are immobilized by straining and or adsorption stevik et al 2004 straining depends on soil particle size the size and shape of the bacterial cells the degree of water saturation and the clogging of filter media stevik et al 2004 it is an important reduction mechanism when i the average bacterial cell size exceeds that of the smallest 5 of the particles constituting the porous material and ii the geometrical suffusion security calculated using eq 1 is 1 5 stevik et al 2004 1 η sg d p f s d k 1 5 here d p is the cell diameter and f s is the empirical transit factor for suffusion determined to be 0 6 by bolster et al 1999 the dk term represents the hydraulic equivalent diameter of pore canals and is computed as dk 0 2d 10 or 0 455 u 1 6 e d 17 where u is the uniformity coefficient d 60 d 10 e the void ratio and d 10 d 17 and d 60 are the 10th 17th and 60th percentile grain diameters e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa have cell diameters of 0 5 1 5 µm bronk et al 1992 0 5 4 µm kokkinos et al 1998 and 0 5 1 µm madigan et al 1997 respectively with lengths of 2 6 µm bronk et al 1992 0 5 4 µm kokkinos et al 1998 and 1 5 5 µm madigan et al 1997 respectively in both the top and bottom filter layers of the brcs examined in this work 1 of the particles had grain sizes 63 µm therefore the vast majority of the particles in both layers were larger than the average bacterial cell furthermore the calculated geometrical suffusion securities were below 1 5 even in worst case scenarios i e when assuming the biggest diameters lengths therefore criteria i and ii were both unsatisfied indicating that bacteria were not retained in the brcs by physical blocking in the filter material this is supported by the findings of chandrasena et al 2012 and stevik et al 2004 who argue that straining is unlikely to be relevant for most bacteria even when using coarse silt 0 02 0 06 mm grain size which is much finer than the smallest grains 0 2 mm of the filter material used in this work the pores of the brc filter material used in this work were larger than the bacteria so adsorption is likely to have been the dominant bacterial retention mechanism stevik et al 2004 rippy 2015 this is consistent with the conclusion of parker et al 2017 who found physicochemical filtration to be the most important variable when modelling bacteria reduction in stormwater bioretention systems adsorption may be reversible or irreversible stevik et al 2004 reversible adsorption involves weak interactions between bacteria and particle surfaces that allow bacteria to detach stevik et al 2004 irreversible adsorption is permanent depends on contact time and happens when bacterial polymers form bridges between bacteria and the filter material stevik et al 2004 bacterial adsorption can be influenced by physical chemical and or microbiological factors such as the properties of the filter material the presence of organic matter and biofilms temperature and ph stevik et al 2004 in this work ph had no influence on bacteria reduction section 3 1 and the effect of temperature differed strongly between bacterial species and sample types however low temperatures seemed to favor reduction e g by adsorption organic matter increases the filter material s cation exchange capacity and surface area and hence the number of adsorption sites stevik et al 2004 in this work brcs with a szc had 800 g of pine and spruce wood shavings mixed randomly into the bottom layer this added organic matter may partly explain the superior bacteria reduction achieved in brcs with a szc a szc retards infiltration leading to a longer retention time and thereby increasing bacteria reduction by enhancing processes like adsorption natural die off competition and predation chandrasena et al 2014 our results support the beneficial effects of szcs on bacteria reduction but also suggest that these effects are not due to natural die off additionally a recent review on bacteria reduction in brcs rippy 2015 argues that the increased retention time in brcs with a szc promotes adsorption and that this effect is more pronounced when coarser filter materials 1 mm are used enhanced adsorption may thus explain the superior bacteria reduction achieved in brcs with a szc another important factor to consider is that bacteria residing in soils often form biofilms chang 2005 as protection against unfavorable conditions madigan et al 1997 furthermore biofilm formation often accompanies bacterial attachment stevik et al 2004 and seems to be the most important factor for irreversible adherence costerton 1984 it also plays a significant role in controlling the initial attachment growth and survival of bacteria in porous media liu and li 2008 in this work bacteria were continuously exposed to conditions representing both optimal and non optimal environmental conditions it is therefore likely that the bacteria formed biofilms to cope with the continuously changing environment the possibility that biofilm formation may partially explain the beneficial effect of a szc is strengthened by the fact that it should be favored by the szc environment constant water availability and carbon amendments are likely to promote biofilm formation rippy 2015 and microbial activity madigan et al 1997 while the szc environment may be partly anoxic blecken et al 2009a b this would not prevent the growth activity of the bacterial species studied here because they are facultative anaerobes however anoxic conditions induce partly anaerobic respiration which provides less energy than aerobic respiration and thus tends to reduce microbial activity biofilm formation and reduced microbial activity may thus explain the higher bacteria reductions observed in brcs with a szc because biofilm formation was not investigated in the experiments these assumptions remain speculative further work based on these results and other recent work afrooz and boehm 2016 rippy 2015 is recommended to shed light on this issue a third possible explanation for the enhanced bacteria reduction in brcs with a szc is protozoan grazing rippy 2015 however this is inconsistent with the increased outflow concentrations of bacteria from brcs with a szc after a sudden temperature increase table 3 protozoan grazing would actively remove kill bacterial cells on the other hand this temperature increase is likely to increase microbial activity madigan et al 1997 and hence decomposition of organic matter increased levels of dissolved organic matter may reduce bacteria adsorption rippy 2015 increasing the concentration of bacteria in the outflow of brcs with a szc table 3 however the carbon amendments used in this work were wood chips which release only small quantities carbon rippy 2015 the biofilm based explanation for the effect of the szc is supported by the outcomes observed after a sudden increase in temperature such a temperature change would be expected to increase bacterial activity madigan et al 1997 leading to competition between cells and species that in turn would induce separation division destruction of biofilms and thus higher outflow concentrations of bacteria table 3 competition was shown to increase in parallel with saturation and so should be more pronounced in brcs with szcs than in those without rippy 2015 furthermore liu and li 2008 found biofilm detachment sloughing to be the main mechanism responsible for introducing bacteria into the bulk fluid from porous media long after the first observation of bacterial release this may also explain why outflow concentrations peaked during the second watering after a dry period and outflow concentrations from brcs with a szc rose significantly after a temperature increase it has previously been suggested that long rod shaped cells may be preferentially removed during transport through filter material stevik et al 2004 e coli and p aeruginosa have long rod shaped cells whereas e faecalis have spherical cells this implies that e coli and p aeruginosa should be reduced more efficiently than e faecalis no such difference was observed suggesting that cell shape has little effect on bacteria reduction differences in motility could also explain interspecies differences in reduction e coli have peritrichous flagella enabling movement using a swimming like motion vater et al 2014 e faecalis are non motile van horn et al 2002 and p aeruginosa are extremely mobile having monotrichous unipolar flagella that allow rapid swimming in one direction vater et al 2014 e coli and p aeruginosa thus have an advantage over e faecalis because they can move towards food and safety i e biofilms long dry periods seemed beneficial for bacteria reduction fig 3 table 2 this corroborates the findings of parker et al 2017 who identified antecedent drying for 1 week as the second most important variable when modeling bacteria reduction in stormwater bioretention however this conclusion is based on measurements representing the first watering after a dry period and so cannot explain the observation that bacteria outflow concentrations peaked during the second watering after a dry period fig 4 this observation could potentially be due to bacterial adaptation a slow drying rate could increase bacterial survival by increasing the time available to make metabolic adjustments needed to tolerate or prevent desiccation mediated cellular damage chang 2005 in this work the bacteria were continuously exposed to wet dry regimes with the length of the dry periods increasing gradually over time the bacteria thus had plenty of time to adjust on the first watering after a dry period the bacteria restart their metabolism and full activity is restored during the second watering this leads to competition between cells and species re adsorption and sloughing of biofilms and thus increased outflow concentrations the paragraphs above outline some plausible possible mechanisms explaining the observations of the present study however further research on these mechanisms is needed using methods that directly test the occurrence of these mechanisms and their importance for bacteria reduction in stormwater bioretention systems 4 conclusions the removal of e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa in brcs with and without szcs subject to drying and varying temperatures was evaluated under laboratory conditions using pilot scale brcs inflow and outflow concentrations are uncorrelated so internal brc processes control variations in outflow concentrations the studied brcs achieved acceptable overall tss removal but tss levels were found to be sensitive to bacterial biosynthetic activity analyses of first outflow and event based samples gave different results for the same bacterial species the event based outflow concentrations and lrvs of p aeruginosa correlated moderately well and strongly respectively with those of e coli and e faecalis however bacterial species origins have important effects on their behavior during brc bacteria reduction so it is not sufficient to focus exclusively on one species when trying to understand the mechanisms controlling this process bacteria reduction increased with the number of antecedent dry days however these results only represent the first watering after a dry period and bacterial outflow concentrations peaked on the second watering further research is thus needed to properly evaluate the effects of dry periods and underlying mechanisms the effect of temperature strongly depended on bacterial species and sample type but bacterial reduction appeared to be more effective at lower temperatures low temperatures should thus not be seen as an obstacle to the use of stormwater bioretention systems for reducing bacteria levels in stormwater runoff the inclusion of a szc improved bacteria reduction in brcs and weakened the possible negative effects of varying temperature and the duration of dry periods sudden temperature increases which may happen during winter and or spring significantly increased the outflow concentrations from brcs with a szc brcs with szcs may thus be inappropriate for bacteria reduction in such areas despite the szc s beneficial effects our results also strongly indicate that adsorption which may be enhanced by biofilm formation is the main mechanism of bacteria reduction in stormwater brcs the average lrv was above 1 6 for all inflow concentrations indicating that bioretention can be an effective method for reducing bacteria

8610,the impact of drying and temperature on the reduction of escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in stormwater bioretention systems with and without a submerged zone was assessed using 16 pilot scale bioretention columns under controlled laboratory conditions the experimental design enabled analysis of possible interactions between the factors first outflow and event based samples were collected outflow concentrations were independent of inflow concentrations and hence controlled by internal processes overall tss removal was high but sensitive to bacterial synthesis event based samples had significantly higher bacteria concentrations than first outflow samples suggesting that remaining surviving bacteria in the bioretention cells have little effect on initial peak outflow concentrations the effect of temperature varied between bacterial species and sample types long dry periods seemed beneficial for bacteria reduction but outflow bacteria concentrations peaked during the second watering after long dry periods submerged zones significantly reduced bacteria outflow concentrations however sudden temperature increases caused bioretention cells with a submerged zone to produce significantly higher bacteria outflow concentrations than before the temperature increase which was not the case for standard cells bioretention cells with submerged zones may thus be poor choices for reducing bacterial concentrations in stormwater runoff in areas experiencing winter conditions finally our results suggest that adsorption e g further enhanced by biofilm formation is the major mechanism governing bacteria reduction in bioretention systems keywords bacteria submerged zone stormwater bioretention winter performance wet and dry periods 1 introduction pathogens are found in urban stormwater runoff in all climates and geographical locations and both snow and sediment are considered non point sources of microbial pollution in urban stormwater runoff makepeace et al 1995 microorganism concentrations exhibit significant seasonal variation and are usually lowest during winter selvakumar and borst 2006 however most microorganisms can adapt to temperature changes and or enter dormancy to overcome unfavorable environmental conditions jones and lennon 2010 pathogenic bacteria transported in urban stormwater runoff can be hazardous to human health if stormwater is discharged into recreational waters and or water bodies used for drinking water supply or encounters shellfish beds strassler et al 1999 kloss 2008 epidemiological studies have linked waterborne illnesses to recreational waters receiving urban stormwater runoff haile et al 1999 these issues make it desirable to remove bacteria from urban stormwater runoff one technology for this purpose is stormwater bioretention which provides stormwater quality control by exploiting the chemical biological and physical properties of plants microbes and filter materials reductions in bacterial concentrations achieved in field scale bioretention facilities vary between facilities designs and bacterial species most studies in this area have focused on fecal coliforms and or e coli for which the reported log reductions range from 1 26 to 1 44 passeport et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 and 1 48 and 2 14 chandrasena et al 2016 hathaway et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 respectively laboratory and pilot scale studies have also yielded highly variable e coli log reductions ranging from 1 91 to 4 32 chandrasena et al 2012 chandrasena et al 2014 kim et al 2012 li et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 additionally li and davis 2009 observed differing median event mean concentration emc reductions for e coli 0 01 and 1 06 and fecal coliforms 0 32 and 0 6 in two different bioretention cells fewer studies have examined other bacterial species average log reductions of 0 003 and 0 98 were reported for enterococci in two bioretention cells hathaway et al 2011 and log reductions of 0 88 and 0 98 were measured for campylobacter at two facilities chandrasena et al 2016 another study reported highly efficient removal in excess of 3 log of c perfringens and f rna coliphages li et al 2012 various factors and design modifications have been shown to affect bacteria removal in bioretention one such modification originally developed to promote nitrogen removal is the inclusion of a submerged zone with a cellulose based carbon source szc in the lower part of the filter kim et al 2003 the szc has a significantly beneficial effect on e coli reduction chandrasena et al 2014 li et al 2012 and vegetation plays an important role in reducing bacterial loads by bioretention chandrasena et al 2014 kim et al 2012 overall bacteria e coli reduction improves as bioretention systems age chandrasena et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 and chandrasena et al 2014 and li et al 2012 showed that antecedent drying for up to 2 5 weeks decreased e coli reduction significantly however there is no consensus regarding possible dependency of bacteria reduction on inflow concentrations chandrasena et al 2012 li et al 2012 finally a low temperature 5 c favored the survival of e coli so bacterial survival can be expected to increase with decreasing temperature zhang et al 2012 most of the above mentioned studies focused on the commonly used indicator bacterium e coli efforts to evaluate the presence of harmful pathogens in stormwater runoff commonly use e coli and e faecalis as indicator bacteria strassler et al 1999 consequently these species were also examined in this work however stormwater sometimes has high concentrations of bacteria and other pathogenic microorganisms of non human and non enteric origin so measurements of fecal indicator species alone may be insufficient for accurate assessments of health risks o shea and field 1992 furthermore the shape stevik et al 2004 and or motility vater et al 2014 of bacteria may affect their reduction a non enteric bacterium was therefore included in our assessments based on a thorough examination of the literature p aeruginosa was selected p aeruginosa is an opportunistic non enteric pathogen that can survive for several days in water with no low nutrient content makepeace et al 1995 it is ubiquitous in water systems lutz and lee 2011 and is commonly associated with human illness mena and gerba 2009 among other things it is the primary cause of ear infections in swimmers otitis externa lutz and lee 2011 and a well established cause of ear and or skin infections in healthy non compromised hosts mena and gerba 2009 urban run off is thought to be a source of p aeruginosa mena and gerba 2009 and some consider its presence to be an indicator of contamination from surface runoff warburton et al 1994 despite a growing number of studies on the performance of bioretention systems microbial dynamics in bioretention cells are poorly understood chandrasena et al 2017 many studies on the environmental conditions and design parameters affecting bacteria reduction in such systems see above have examined individual factors in isolation only a few studies have evaluated the combined effects and interactions of multiple two factors e g chandrasena et al 2014 li et al 2012 to our knowledge the effect of seasonal variation in temperature in relation to the presence of a szc and intermittent dry periods has not been systematically evaluated under controlled conditions therefore the objective of this study was to examine the effects of environmental conditions antecedent drying and temperature bioretention system design szc and their potential interactions on indicator bacteria reduction to this end the reduction of e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa in pilot scale bioretention columns brcs with and without submerged zones was studied under controlled laboratory conditions at two different temperatures 2 and 25 c with dry periods of 2 37 days this was followed by a study on the effect of a temperature increase from 2 to 25 c on bacteria reduction to characterize the effects of these variables in the brcs between inflow events two subsamples were collected during each event the first liter of outflow the first outflow sample and 1 l of the remaining outflow the event based sample three bacterial species e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa were examined to gain a broader perspective than would be obtained by focusing solely on e coli 2 methods 2 1 experimental set up sixteen pilot scale brcs constructed from pvc pipes diameter 380 mm height 900 mm

spruce wood shavings mixed randomly into the bottom layer corresponding to a soil organic matter content of 1 the brc design is summarized in fig s1 each brc was planted with nine native wet drought tolerant plants 82plants m2 adapted to nordic climates three plants each of juncus conglomeratus phalaris arundinacea and carex panacea after planting the columns were stored outside and watered twice weekly with unchlorinated tap water for three months half of the columns of each type were then placed in an indoor greenhouse and the other half were placed in a refrigerated container both environments had near constant air temperatures 25 1 0 3 c and 1 5 0 3 c ebro ebi310 temperature logger to ensure continuous plant growth after the columns were moved inside they were illuminated with high pressure sodium greenhouse lamps g power agro 400 w 55 000 lm for 12 h daily the columns were watered with unchlorinated tap water for another three months before stormwater dosing started 2 2 experimental procedures the experiment was divided into two parts with durations of 120 and 22 days fig 1 part 1 consisted of wet periods where the brcs were watered twice weekly with 15 l of semi synthetic stormwater and three dry periods of 6 17 and 37 days outflow water was sampled before a dry period and on the first and second waterings after a dry period part 2 was only performed using the brcs in the refrigerated container after sampling run 9 the temperature in the container was increased from 1 5c to 25 3c 0 4 c and allowed to adjust for a week during this period the brcs were continuously watered with 15 l of semi synthetic stormwater twice weekly and outflow samples were collected on days 128 135 and 142 fig 1 illustrates the experimental schedule 2 3 stormwater preparation semi synthetic stormwater was prepared 24 h before each dosing by adding 200 mg l natural stormwater sediment originating from a stormwater gully pot to 190 l of tap water to ensure homogeneity the water was continuously mixed nonpathogenic strains of e coli culti loops escherichia coli atcc 11775 thermo scientific e faecalis culti loops enterococcus faecaslis atcc 29212 thermo scientific and p aeruginosa culti loops pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145 thermo scientific were cultivated in trypton soya broth tsb oxoid tv 5002e lot 1429272 at 37 c for 24 h then 5 ml of each bacterial suspension was added to the stormwater 30 min before dosing the stormwater inflow characteristics are summarized in table 1 2 4 sampling at each dosing event a grab sample of one liter of inflow was collected in sterile pe bottles at each temperature immediately before watering began the first liter of outflow subsequently referred to as first outflow was collected in a sterile 1 l pe bottle allmost all of the subsequent outflow was collected in sterile 20 l pe buckets washed in 100 ethanol immediately before watering the columns were allowed to drain for approximately three hours so that only a minor proportion of the inflow water was retained in the columns a 1 l sub sample of this collected outflow was then collected in a sterile pe bottle these subsamples are henceforth referred to as event based samples while stirring the collected water samples were transported directly to a refrigerator 4 6 c and stored until analysis which was performed within two hours of sample collection samples were removed from the refrigerator one at a time 2 5 analytical methods all samples were analyzed for tss ph e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa tss was determined by filtration through whatman gf a 1 6 µm pore size glass microfibre filters ss en 872 2005 in one replicate ph was measured with a field ph meter ph330 wtw gmbh weilheim germany e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa were enumerated using colilert enterolert e and pseudalert test kits respectively and quantified using quanti tray 2000 idexx europe b v netherlands sample dilutions were performed when needed to adequately quantify bacteria concentrations the detection limits for all three methods are 1 cfu per 100 ml sample within 24 h blank tests using colilert the enterolert e test kit and the pseudalert test kit showed an absence of analyzed parameters 2 6 data analysis bacteria concentrations below the detection limit which occurred in 1 event based sample for e faecalis 19 first outflow samples for p aeruginosa and 8 event based samples for p aeruginosa were recorded as half of the detection limit bacteria concentrations too numerous to count which occurred in 11 first outflow and 13 event based samples for e coli 1 first outflow sample for p aeruginosa and 2 event based samples for p aeruginosa were excluded from subsequent analyses for tss analysis a 500 ml subsample was filtered 1 6 µm giving a detection limit of 4 mg l all tss results 4 mg l 129 samples were recorded as half of the detection limit the total number of samples per pollutant was 168 the normality of the data was tested by performing an individual distribution identification anderson darling test and goodness of fit test inflow series and outflow ph were found to be normally distributed bacteria and tss outflow concentrations were non normally distributed hence non parametric tests were used for comparisons involving non normally distributed datasets average bacteria concentrations are reported as geometric means and are plotted as logarithmic log10 values or with logarithmic y axes due to the large numbers involved reductions are expressed as log10 reduction values lrv i e log10 final concentration initial concentration to account for the standing water in brcs having a szc estimated to be approximately 20 l based on a filter material porosity of 0 4 and assuming plug flow log10 reduction values were calculated using inflow values from the previous watering for columns with a szc and inflow values from the same day for columns with no szc one way anova followed by tukey s test was used to determine whether the inflow concentrations differed between the two studied temperatures 1 5 c and 25 1 c the inflow ph and outflow ph at the two temperatures were compared using paired t tests spearman s rank correlation tests were performed to evaluate correlations between tss and bacteria levels in the inflow and outflow and between tss removal and bacterial lrvs this test was also used to evaluate correlations between inflow and outflow concentrations and between outflow concentrations of different species pearsońs correlation test was used to evaluate correlations between bacterial log10 reductions for first outflow and event based samples since no correlation was found between in and outflow concentrations these were compared using mood s median test despite the lack of independence first outflow and event based concentrations for individual bacterial species were compared using the wilcoxon signed rank test paired t tests were performed to determine whether log10 reductions differed between first outflow and event based samples log10 reductions for brcs with and without a szc at 25 1 c and 1 5 c neglecting antecedent drying were compared using one way anovas followed by tukey s test general linear models glm were run to examine the main effects of varying temperature brc designs with and without a szc varying lengths of antecedent dry days and their interactions on both outflow concentrations and log10 reductions main effect plots and interaction plots see supporting information were created to illustrate the observed effects and interactions of the glm because of their non normal distributions outflow concentrations were box cox transformed prior to analysis the kruskal wallis test was used to determine whether outflow concentrations before the temperature increase differed from those afterwards if a significant difference was found a mann whitney test was performed for all statistical tests significance was accepted at an α level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 inflow and outflow characteristics e coli inflow concentrations were significantly higher than e faecalis and p aeruginosa inflow concentrations at both temperatures and the inflow concentrations of the latter two species did not differ significantly at either temperature table 1 additionally the inflow concentrations of both e faecalis and p aeruginosa differed significantly between the two temperatures this indicates that e faecalis and p aeruginosa are more sensitive to temperature than e coli differences in inflow concentrations between species were expected due to their different living conditions and nutritional demands as well as interspecies competition no correlations spearman s rank between in and outflow concentrations were found for any bacterial species in either first outflow or event based samples separate tests were performed for non szc and szc columns the variation in the outflow concentrations was thus attributable to the studied factors rather than the relatively constant inflow concentrations previous field studies chandrasena et al 2016 li et al 2012 found positive correlations between in and outflow bacteria concentrations indicating that the studied bioretention systems had only limited capacities for bacterial retention this was attributed to the pronounced variation in the composition of real inflowing stormwater all inflow concentrations and ph values were significantly higher mood s median test than the corresponding outflow concentrations and ph values additionally event based samples had significantly higher concentrations of all three bacterial species than first outflow samples wilcoxon signed rank test fig 4 indicating that bacterial outflow concentrations do not peak during the first outflow this resulted in significant lrv differences with the lrvs of first outflow samples generally being higher than those of event based samples fig 3 this difference shows that relatively large variations can occur during single outflow events which are not fully captured by simply evaluating event mean concentrations the latter further suggests that remaining surviving bacteria in bioretention systems should not cause problematic initial peak outflow concentrations furthermore tss did not correlate with the concentrations of any bacterial species in the inflow or outflow this was expected since previous studies found the majority of e coli cells to exist in free suspension fries et al 2006 chandrasena et al 2012 and other studies found poor or no correlations between indicator bacteria concentrations and tss in urban stormwater runoff mccarthy et al 2012 galfi et al 2016 bacterial survival is sensitive to ph madigan et al 1997 extremely low or high ph conditions may strongly inactivate microbes but die off rates are low at neutral ph madigan et al 1997 although the ph was significantly lower in the outflow than the inflow at both temperatures ph did not affect the observed brc bacteria reductions because both the inflow ph 7 18 7 39 independently of temperature and outflow ph 6 13 7 39 independently of temperature and brc design were within the neutral range the latter result is consistent with an earlier study jewett et al 1995 that found bacterial transport to be ph independent at ph values between 5 5 and 7 0 3 2 total suspended solids tss removal was always above 95 for brcs with no szc and columns with a szc at 1 5 c fig 3 however at 25 1 c brcs with a szc had poor removal fig 3 resulting in significantly elevated tss outflow concentrations fig 2 this may be because the measured tss is excreted alginate a reddish brown powder produced by p aeruginosa to protect itself from adverse surroundings and enhance adhesion to solid surfaces boyd and chakrabarty 1995 this hypothesis is supported by the brownish red coloration of the tss obtained from brcs with a szc at 25 1 c and the significant effect of the temp szc interaction table 2 s1 no such effect of the presence of szc on tss removal was observed in earlier studies on stormwater bioretention that did not include p aeruginosa e g blecken et al 2009a b søberg et al 2017 similarly no effect of the presence of a szc on tss removal was observed at 1 5 c probably because micro biological processes are retarded at lower temperatures and so the outflow was free of alginate 3 3 escherichia coli independently of the studied factors and design configuration the lrv for e coli ranged from 1 33 to 6 66 and 0 2 to 4 32 for first outflow and event based samples respectively fig 3 with arithmetic means of 2 98 and 1 59 the average event based lrvs for brcs with no szc 0 73 and 0 99 at 1 5 and 25 1 c respectively for all lengths of antecedent dry days agreed well with previously reported average lrvs for brcs with no szc e g chandrasena et al 2014 kim et al 2012 likewise the event based lrvs for brcs with a szc 2 63 and 2 05 at 1 5 and 25 1 c respectively were similar to previously reported values for such systems chandrasena et al 2014 li et al 2012 conversely chandrasena et al 2016 reported a lrv of 1 23 for a field scale bioretention facility with a 200 mm deep szc this may have been due to challenging operational conditions at that specific facility first outflow samples had significantly higher average lrvs 2 45 and 3 04 with no szc and 2 98 and 3 43 with a szc at 1 5 and 25 1 c respectively than event based samples so their lrvs were higher than those reported previously for bioretention systems independently of their design e g chandrasena et al 2016 hathaway et al 2011 kim et al 2012 however previous studies did not measure first outflow separately making direct comparisons impossible the szc temperature and length of prior drying had significant effects on e coli reduction in the brcs table 2 s1 the inclusion of a szc was beneficial for e coli reduction table 2 s1 the latter has been shown previously chandrasena et al 2014 li et al 2012 increasing the number of antecedent dry days reduced e coli outflow concentrations significantly table 2 s1 so longer dry periods significantly increased lrvs table 2 s1 conversely chandrasena et al 2014 and li et al 2012 found that antecedent dry days had a significant negative effect on e coli reduction however the drying periods they examined did not exceed 2 5 weeks zhang et al 2011 examined the long term performance of bacteria removal in brcs incorporating some drying in the experimental setup their columns were watered once every second week for 18 months resulting in antecedent drying periods of 13 days however because of the constant dry period duration drying was not incorporated as a factor in their experiment temperature had opposite effects on e coli outflow concentrations for event based samples and first outflow samples table 2 s1 for first outflow samples e coli concentrations were significantly lower so the corresponding lrvs were higher at the warmer temperature whereas the opposite applied for event based samples table 2 s1 e coli is an intestinal bacterium so its optimum growth temperature is 37 c its growth rate increases with temperature from 21 to 37 c but declines outside this range neidhardt 1996 e coli growth was therefore expected to be higher at 25 1 c than at 1 5 c leading to higher outflow concentrations and lower lrvs at the higher temperature which was also the case for event based samples whereas the opposite was observed for first outflow samples zhang et al 2012 found temperature to have no significant influence on e coli transport and capture in conventional bioretention media but concluded that bacterial survival could be expected to increase with decreasing temperature this may be why the outflow concentrations in first outflow samples at 1 5 c were higher than at 25 1 c more bacterial cells survived at the lower temperature and when the brcs were re watered these surviving bacterial cells were rapidly transported out of the brc the temp szc interaction significantly affected outflow concentrations and event based lrvs table 2 interaction plots fig s2a b revealed that the differences in outflow concentrations and event based lrvs between brcs with and without a szc were smallest at 25 1 c for brcs with a szc at 1 5 c event based samples had lower outflow concentrations and higher lrvs than first outflow samples conversely for brcs with a szc at 25 1 c first outflow samples had lower outflow concentrations than event based samples the beneficial effect of a szc is thus more pronounced at 1 5 c furthermore a szc evens out variation in outflow concentrations and lrvs resulting from different lengths of antecedent dry days and significantly increases lrvs in cases with long antecedent dry periods table 2 s1 the temperature increase from 1 5 c to 25 3 c implemented in the second part of the experiment was expected to increase e coli outflow concentrations as discussed previously as expected the outflow concentrations from brcs with a szc were significantly higher after the temperature increase than before table 3 fig 4 however no significant effect was observed for brcs without a szc table 3 fig 4 this may be because brcs with a szc offer more favorable conditions for bacteria due to permanent water availability and low temperatures promote bacterial dormancy then when the temperature increases and conditions become more supportive of bacterial growth the e coli concentration increases rapidly leading to increased outflow concentrations 3 4 enterococcus faecalis independently of the studied factors and brc design configuration the lrvs for e faecalis ranged from 1 49 to 5 77 and 0 02 6 47 for first outflow and event based samples respectively with arithmetic means of 3 38 and 1 91 fig 3 the reduction of e faecalis in stormwater bioretention systems has not previously been examined however hathaway et al 2011 measured the reduction of enterococci from natural stormwater in two field scale bioretention facilities during different seasons and reported average lrvs of 0 003 for a shallow bioretention system 25 cm filter depth and 0 98 for a deeper facility 60 cm filter depth since e faecalis belongs to the genus enterococci and resembles other members of the genus in terms of morphology and nutritional requirements comparable reductions were expected in this study the average lrv of e faecalis for brcs without a szc at 25 1 c when not considering temperature and antecedent dry days was 1 16 this value is comparable to that reported by hathaway et al 2011 for a deep system that resembles our columns shallower systems performed worse kadam et al 2008 obtained lrvs of 2 11 1 22 and 2 44 for the reduction of e faecalis from municipal wastewater in three 70 cm deep soil filters despite differences in design and inflow water composition between the studied systems these results are comparable to those obtained for event based samples in this work brcs with a szc had significantly lower e faecalis outflow concentrations and thus higher lrvs than those without a szc table 2 s1 long drying periods had similar effects table 2 s1 as for e coli temperature had opposite effects on e faecalis outflow concentrations for event based samples and first outflow samples table 2 s1 for first outflow samples e faecalis concentrations were significantly lower so the corresponding lrvs were higher at the warmer temperature whereas the opposite applied for event based samples table 2 s1 e faecalis outflow concentrations was expected to be higher at high temperature as was the case for event based samples since e faecalis grows very slowly at 7 c and grows optimally at 37 c garcía de fernando et al 1991 1 5 c is on the low end of its temperature growth range and permits only minimal growth the observed higher outflow concentrations of e faecalis at low temperature for first outflow samples is probably explained by the same reasons as previously discussed for e coli the temp szc interaction had a significant effect on e faecalis outflow concentrations and lrvs for both first outflow and event based samples table 2 s1 interaction plots figure s3a b revealed that the differences in outflow concentrations and lrvs between brcs with and without a szc were smaller at 25 1 c than at 1 5 c however for brcs with a szc the lowest outflow concentrations and highest lrvs were observed in event based samples at 1 5 c and in first outflow samples at 25 1 c in systems with a szc longer dry periods significantly increased the lrvs of event based samples table 2 s1 however the presence of a szc evened out variation associated with dry periods of different durations conversely longer dry periods reduced outflow concentrations and thus increased the lrvs of first outflow samples table 2 s1 the presence of a szc enhanced the latter effect the temp add antecedent dry days interaction was not significant for event based samples but had a significant effect on both outflow concentrations and lrvs for first outflow samples table 2 short dry periods 2 or 3 days gave higher outflow concentrations at 25 1 c but intermediate length dry periods 4 6 or 17 days gave higher outflow concentrations at 1 5 c table s1 temperature had no detectable effect on outflow concentrations after 37 antecedent dry days fig s2a table s1 the lrvs for first outflow samples after short dry periods 2 or 3 days and long 37 days dry periods were temperature independent but were higher at 25 1 c than at 1 5 c after intermediate length dry periods 4 17 days table s1 the temperature increase from 1 5 c to 25 3 c was expected to increase e faecalis outflow concentrations for the same reasons as for e coli this expectation was validated for brcs with a szc table 3 fig 4 but no significant differences were found for brcs without a szc table 3 fig 4 potential explanations for the latter result are discussed in section 3 3 3 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa independently of the studied factors and design configuration the lrvs for p aeruginosa ranged from 0 94 to 6 57 and 0 47 to 6 55 for first outflow and event based samples respectively fig 3 with arithmetic means of 4 12 and 2 47 p aeruginosa reduction in stormwater bioretention systems has not been evaluated before however a study on pathogen removal from municipal wastewater in three constructed soil filters with filter depths of 70 cm found average lrvs for p aeruginosa of 1 64 1 88 and 1 37 kadam et al 2008 despite differences between the examined filters the results of kadam et al 2008 are in the same range as the lrvs for event based samples obtained in this work brcs with a szc had significantly lower outflow concentrations and thus higher lrvs of p aeruginosa than those with no szc only significant for event based samples table 2 s1 longer drying periods reduced outflow concentrations table 2 s1 and hence had a significant increasing effect on lrv table 2 s1 temperature had a significant effect on both event based and first outflow samples table 2 with significantly higher outflow concentrations and lower lrvs at the warmer temperature fig 3 table 2 s1 the latter observation was expected since p aeruginosa grows between 4 and 42 c with optimum growth at 37 c labauve and wargo 2005 its growth should thus be disfavored below 4 c despite this expected limitation the outflow concentrations of p aeruginosa at 1 5 c ranged from 0 5 to 24 499 mpn ml the temp add antecedent dry days interaction had no significant effect on lrvs for first outflow or event based samples table 2 however it did significantly decrease outflow concentrations for both sample types table 2 s1 interaction plots fig s4a b revealed that antecedent dry days had no effect at 1 5 c since no variations in outflow concentration existed the latter further supports the previously discussed effect of temperature on p aeruginosa however at 25 1 c longer drying periods yielded lower outflow concentrations which is consistent with the observations for e coli and e faecalis the add antecedent dry days szc interaction had a significant effect on both lrv and outflow concentrations table 2 for first outflow concentrations no difference existed between brcs with and without a szc but lrv varied in between both design and length of antecedent dry days fig s4a b for event based samples the presence of a szc evened out variations in outflow concentration caused by the different lengths of antecedent dry days and reduced outflow concentrations relative to those seen for brcs with no szc the presence of a szc also increased the lrvs for p aeruginosa but had no effect on the variation in lrv caused by different lengths of antecedent dry days the temp szc interaction had significant effects on lrvs and outflow concentrations for both designs table 2 for first outflow samples p aeruginosa outflow concentrations in brcs with and without a szc did not differ significantly at 1 5 c however at 25 1 c brcs with a szc yielded higher outflow concentrations than those with no szc table s1 the lrvs for brcs with and without a szc did not differ significantly at 25 1 c and were lower than those at 1 5 c additionally the presence of a szc resulted in higher lrvs at the lower temperature the opposite was observed for event based samples brcs with and without a szc had identical outflow concentrations at 1 5 c but at 25 1 c brcs with a szc had lower outflow concentrations than those without the presence of a szc reduced event based lrvs at both temperatures but this effect was most pronounced at 1 5 c no general conclusions can be readily drawn from the observed two way interactions for p aeruginosa however the outflow concentrations and lrvs for this species are clearly more sensitive to temperature than to variation in dry period duration or the presence of a szc this hypothesis is supported by the results obtained upon raising the temperature from 1 5 c to 25 3 c the outflow concentrations after the temperature increase were always significantly higher than before table 3 fig 4 the insensitivity of this effect to the presence of a szc or the number of antecedent dry days indicates that temperature governs p aeruginosa behavior rather than brc design and or dry period duration 3 6 correlations between bacterial species outflow concentrations of e coli and e faecalis correlated well with spearman s rank correlation coefficients r s of 0 89 and 0 84 for first outflow and event based samples respectively for first outflow samples no correlation between e coli and p aeruginosa r s 0 3 and e faecalis and p aeruginosa r s 0 26 existed however for event based samples moderately strong correlations between e coli and p aeruginosa r s 0 58 and e faecalis and p aeruginosa r s 0 61 were found despite their different origins in nature in addition the log10 reductions of e coli and e faecalis correlated well with pearson correlation coefficients r of 0 83 and 0 84 for first outflow and event based samples respectively there were no detectable correlations between the log10 reductions of e coli and p aeruginosa r 0 34 or e faecalis and p aeruginosa r 0 35 based on first outflow samples however analyses of event based samples revealed good correlations between the log10 reductions of e coli and p aeruginosa r 0 72 and e faecalis and p aeruginosa r 0 75 the relatively strong correlations between the bacterial species seen with event based samples support the use of the indicator bacteria e coli and e faecalis in contrast the lack of between species correlations in first outflow samples suggests that bacterial species with a diverse range of origins should be considered when evaluating bacteria reduction in stormwater bioretention systems instead of relying solely on e coli this conclusion inconsistent with the results of chandrasena et al 2016 who found no correlation between the log reductions of e coli and campylobacter spp based on event mean samples 3 7 possible retention mechanisms in porous media bacteria are immobilized by straining and or adsorption stevik et al 2004 straining depends on soil particle size the size and shape of the bacterial cells the degree of water saturation and the clogging of filter media stevik et al 2004 it is an important reduction mechanism when i the average bacterial cell size exceeds that of the smallest 5 of the particles constituting the porous material and ii the geometrical suffusion security calculated using eq 1 is 1 5 stevik et al 2004 1 η sg d p f s d k 1 5 here d p is the cell diameter and f s is the empirical transit factor for suffusion determined to be 0 6 by bolster et al 1999 the dk term represents the hydraulic equivalent diameter of pore canals and is computed as dk 0 2d 10 or 0 455 u 1 6 e d 17 where u is the uniformity coefficient d 60 d 10 e the void ratio and d 10 d 17 and d 60 are the 10th 17th and 60th percentile grain diameters e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa have cell diameters of 0 5 1 5 µm bronk et al 1992 0 5 4 µm kokkinos et al 1998 and 0 5 1 µm madigan et al 1997 respectively with lengths of 2 6 µm bronk et al 1992 0 5 4 µm kokkinos et al 1998 and 1 5 5 µm madigan et al 1997 respectively in both the top and bottom filter layers of the brcs examined in this work 1 of the particles had grain sizes 63 µm therefore the vast majority of the particles in both layers were larger than the average bacterial cell furthermore the calculated geometrical suffusion securities were below 1 5 even in worst case scenarios i e when assuming the biggest diameters lengths therefore criteria i and ii were both unsatisfied indicating that bacteria were not retained in the brcs by physical blocking in the filter material this is supported by the findings of chandrasena et al 2012 and stevik et al 2004 who argue that straining is unlikely to be relevant for most bacteria even when using coarse silt 0 02 0 06 mm grain size which is much finer than the smallest grains 0 2 mm of the filter material used in this work the pores of the brc filter material used in this work were larger than the bacteria so adsorption is likely to have been the dominant bacterial retention mechanism stevik et al 2004 rippy 2015 this is consistent with the conclusion of parker et al 2017 who found physicochemical filtration to be the most important variable when modelling bacteria reduction in stormwater bioretention systems adsorption may be reversible or irreversible stevik et al 2004 reversible adsorption involves weak interactions between bacteria and particle surfaces that allow bacteria to detach stevik et al 2004 irreversible adsorption is permanent depends on contact time and happens when bacterial polymers form bridges between bacteria and the filter material stevik et al 2004 bacterial adsorption can be influenced by physical chemical and or microbiological factors such as the properties of the filter material the presence of organic matter and biofilms temperature and ph stevik et al 2004 in this work ph had no influence on bacteria reduction section 3 1 and the effect of temperature differed strongly between bacterial species and sample types however low temperatures seemed to favor reduction e g by adsorption organic matter increases the filter material s cation exchange capacity and surface area and hence the number of adsorption sites stevik et al 2004 in this work brcs with a szc had 800 g of pine and spruce wood shavings mixed randomly into the bottom layer this added organic matter may partly explain the superior bacteria reduction achieved in brcs with a szc a szc retards infiltration leading to a longer retention time and thereby increasing bacteria reduction by enhancing processes like adsorption natural die off competition and predation chandrasena et al 2014 our results support the beneficial effects of szcs on bacteria reduction but also suggest that these effects are not due to natural die off additionally a recent review on bacteria reduction in brcs rippy 2015 argues that the increased retention time in brcs with a szc promotes adsorption and that this effect is more pronounced when coarser filter materials 1 mm are used enhanced adsorption may thus explain the superior bacteria reduction achieved in brcs with a szc another important factor to consider is that bacteria residing in soils often form biofilms chang 2005 as protection against unfavorable conditions madigan et al 1997 furthermore biofilm formation often accompanies bacterial attachment stevik et al 2004 and seems to be the most important factor for irreversible adherence costerton 1984 it also plays a significant role in controlling the initial attachment growth and survival of bacteria in porous media liu and li 2008 in this work bacteria were continuously exposed to conditions representing both optimal and non optimal environmental conditions it is therefore likely that the bacteria formed biofilms to cope with the continuously changing environment the possibility that biofilm formation may partially explain the beneficial effect of a szc is strengthened by the fact that it should be favored by the szc environment constant water availability and carbon amendments are likely to promote biofilm formation rippy 2015 and microbial activity madigan et al 1997 while the szc environment may be partly anoxic blecken et al 2009a b this would not prevent the growth activity of the bacterial species studied here because they are facultative anaerobes however anoxic conditions induce partly anaerobic respiration which provides less energy than aerobic respiration and thus tends to reduce microbial activity biofilm formation and reduced microbial activity may thus explain the higher bacteria reductions observed in brcs with a szc because biofilm formation was not investigated in the experiments these assumptions remain speculative further work based on these results and other recent work afrooz and boehm 2016 rippy 2015 is recommended to shed light on this issue a third possible explanation for the enhanced bacteria reduction in brcs with a szc is protozoan grazing rippy 2015 however this is inconsistent with the increased outflow concentrations of bacteria from brcs with a szc after a sudden temperature increase table 3 protozoan grazing would actively remove kill bacterial cells on the other hand this temperature increase is likely to increase microbial activity madigan et al 1997 and hence decomposition of organic matter increased levels of dissolved organic matter may reduce bacteria adsorption rippy 2015 increasing the concentration of bacteria in the outflow of brcs with a szc table 3 however the carbon amendments used in this work were wood chips which release only small quantities carbon rippy 2015 the biofilm based explanation for the effect of the szc is supported by the outcomes observed after a sudden increase in temperature such a temperature change would be expected to increase bacterial activity madigan et al 1997 leading to competition between cells and species that in turn would induce separation division destruction of biofilms and thus higher outflow concentrations of bacteria table 3 competition was shown to increase in parallel with saturation and so should be more pronounced in brcs with szcs than in those without rippy 2015 furthermore liu and li 2008 found biofilm detachment sloughing to be the main mechanism responsible for introducing bacteria into the bulk fluid from porous media long after the first observation of bacterial release this may also explain why outflow concentrations peaked during the second watering after a dry period and outflow concentrations from brcs with a szc rose significantly after a temperature increase it has previously been suggested that long rod shaped cells may be preferentially removed during transport through filter material stevik et al 2004 e coli and p aeruginosa have long rod shaped cells whereas e faecalis have spherical cells this implies that e coli and p aeruginosa should be reduced more efficiently than e faecalis no such difference was observed suggesting that cell shape has little effect on bacteria reduction differences in motility could also explain interspecies differences in reduction e coli have peritrichous flagella enabling movement using a swimming like motion vater et al 2014 e faecalis are non motile van horn et al 2002 and p aeruginosa are extremely mobile having monotrichous unipolar flagella that allow rapid swimming in one direction vater et al 2014 e coli and p aeruginosa thus have an advantage over e faecalis because they can move towards food and safety i e biofilms long dry periods seemed beneficial for bacteria reduction fig 3 table 2 this corroborates the findings of parker et al 2017 who identified antecedent drying for 1 week as the second most important variable when modeling bacteria reduction in stormwater bioretention however this conclusion is based on measurements representing the first watering after a dry period and so cannot explain the observation that bacteria outflow concentrations peaked during the second watering after a dry period fig 4 this observation could potentially be due to bacterial adaptation a slow drying rate could increase bacterial survival by increasing the time available to make metabolic adjustments needed to tolerate or prevent desiccation mediated cellular damage chang 2005 in this work the bacteria were continuously exposed to wet dry regimes with the length of the dry periods increasing gradually over time the bacteria thus had plenty of time to adjust on the first watering after a dry period the bacteria restart their metabolism and full activity is restored during the second watering this leads to competition between cells and species re adsorption and sloughing of biofilms and thus increased outflow concentrations the paragraphs above outline some plausible possible mechanisms explaining the observations of the present study however further research on these mechanisms is needed using methods that directly test the occurrence of these mechanisms and their importance for bacteria reduction in stormwater bioretention systems 4 conclusions the removal of e coli e faecalis and p aeruginosa in brcs with and without szcs subject to drying and varying temperatures was evaluated under laboratory conditions using pilot scale brcs inflow and outflow concentrations are uncorrelated so internal brc processes control variations in outflow concentrations the studied brcs achieved acceptable overall tss removal but tss levels were found to be sensitive to bacterial biosynthetic activity analyses of first outflow and event based samples gave different results for the same bacterial species the event based outflow concentrations and lrvs of p aeruginosa correlated moderately well and strongly respectively with those of e coli and e faecalis however bacterial species origins have important effects on their behavior during brc bacteria reduction so it is not sufficient to focus exclusively on one species when trying to understand the mechanisms controlling this process bacteria reduction increased with the number of antecedent dry days however these results only represent the first watering after a dry period and bacterial outflow concentrations peaked on the second watering further research is thus needed to properly evaluate the effects of dry periods and underlying mechanisms the effect of temperature strongly depended on bacterial species and sample type but bacterial reduction appeared to be more effective at lower temperatures low temperatures should thus not be seen as an obstacle to the use of stormwater bioretention systems for reducing bacteria levels in stormwater runoff the inclusion of a szc improved bacteria reduction in brcs and weakened the possible negative effects of varying temperature and the duration of dry periods sudden temperature increases which may happen during winter and or spring significantly increased the outflow concentrations from brcs with a szc brcs with szcs may thus be inappropriate for bacteria reduction in such areas despite the szc s beneficial effects our results also strongly indicate that adsorption which may be enhanced by biofilm formation is the main mechanism of bacteria reduction in stormwater brcs the average lrv was above 1 6 for all inflow concentrations indicating that bioretention can be an effective method for reducing bacteria

8611,this study evaluates the hypothesis that increased organic contaminant sorption and hence residence time in urban riverbed deposits may occur due to the presence of highly sorbing sediment components of anthropogenic origin that contain thermally altered carbonaceous materials tacm the hypothesis was confirmed through laboratory batch studies examining tetrachloroethene pce sorption on riverbed sediment samples from the highly urbanised river tame headwaters catchment birmingham uk and the river tern shropshire providing a nearby rural benchmark urban riverbed sorption was elevated with observed organic carbon partition coefficient koc values over an order of magnitude greater than rural values the latter compare to the widely used us epa geometric mean koc and attributed to absorption dominated partitioning into recent natural organic matter use of that mean is inappropriate for the urban riverbed potentially underestimating retardation by an order of magnitude organic petrography confirmed the urban riverbed contained a high proportion of tacm rich organic matter particles to which significant adsorption might be expected furthermore elevated urban koc values were consistent with tacm rich sediment literature estimates the tacm source appears to be riverine transport of particulate matter from historical industrial urban or coal mining processing activities prevalent upstream since the industrial revolution consequences of the increased urban riverbed residence time on attenuation and bioavailability assumption sensitivities were modelled under the standard assumption of sorbed contaminant being non bioavailable rapid rates of aqueous phase biodegradation are necessary for complete attenuation within a riverbed conversely if adsorbed contaminant is bioavailable then complete attenuation is probable where highly adsorbing anthropocene urban riverbed sediments are present even for long half lives therefore anthropocene sediment occurrence may significantly influence modern day contaminant fate within the urban riverbed the principal implication being greatly increased sorption and residence times may occur in urban riverbeds than conventionally assumed further research should focus upon whether adsorbed contaminants have any bioavailability causing increased contaminant flux attenuation and surface water quality protection keywords urban riverbed sediments sorption bioavailability anthropocene chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs 1 introduction the residence time of groundwater organic contaminants in riverbed

cahs that include the notorious groundwater contaminants trichloroethene tce and tetrachloroethene pce prominence of these solvents not only relates to their ubiquitous historical use for degreasing but also their dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl properties resulting in deep aquifer penetration and subsurface persistence rivett et al 2014 yang et al 2018 this persistence coupled with often

associated laboratory studies have often focused upon biodegradation the key mass loss attenuation process atashgahi et al 2017 freitas et al 2015 lee and lee 2015 weatherill et al 2018 we however contend that sorption of discharging cah plumes in urban riverbeds demands closer scrutiny urban anthropogenic influences over decades or even centuries of the anthropocene will have led to modification of the riverbed deposits potentially causing them to have different sorption properties from those present under pre urban conditions sorption predominantly occurs to organic matter om within the riverbed sediments this material may be comprised of natural organic matter nom as well as anthropogenic organic matter aom arising from anthropogenic activities allen king et al 2002 cornelissen and gustafsson 2004 cornelissen et al 2005 grathwohl 1990 jeong et al 2008 kleineidam et al 1999 smith and lerner 2008 nom within a riverbed setting may include gelified or non gelified woody phytoclast tissues and structureless humic fulvic detritus peat seed coatings bark root pollen spores lignin and fungal material whilst such materials may exist in ancient sediments within riverbed settings nom is typically of recent origin due to its labile nature definition of aom is more contentious it includes om whose nature has changed due to anthropogenic activity notably heating to produce thermally altered carbonaceous material tacm allen king et al 2002 jeong et al 2008 it is also taken herein to include om that occurs in the riverbed as a consequence of anthropogenic influence typically urban industrial historical activity coal particles arising from mining activity exemplify the latter aom may thus include hard coals coke mostly formed from coal carbonisation soot from traffic or oil combustion char mostly from coal combustion residues from coal carbonisation and coal and petroleum derived fluorescent materials tar oils and lubricants organic contaminated sediments and globules of dense non aqueous phase liquids napls grathwohl 1990 cornelissen et al 2005 sources include poorly controlled industrial effluent mining and sewage discharges urban runoff illegal dumping and contaminated baseflows sorption includes both partitioning absorption and adsorption of organic contaminants on the various forms of om in the sediment allen king et al 2002 wang et al 2013 the absorption domain consists of amorphous organic matter such as humic and fulvic substances and lignin the absorption process is conceptualised as contaminant hydrophobic phase partitioning into the om phase and is characterised by linear isotherms karickhoff et al 1979 in contrast adsorption occurs to more condensed organic matter with in particular tacm exhibiting very strong non linear adsorption allen king et al 2002 cornelissen and gustafsson 2004 allen king et al 2002 define tacm to encompass non carbonate carbon containing matter that includes carbonaceous matter cm forms created by combustion and pyrolysis processes such as soot and char as well as by geological processes diagenesis and catagenesis such as coal and kerogen allen king et al 2002 wang et al 2013 tacm is particularly hydrophobic and rich in adsorption sites due to its very high surface area micro porosity greater aromaticity and lower o c and h c ratios compared to non thermally altered parent material allen king et al 2002 cornelissen et al 2005 wang et al 2013 critically tacm is prevalent within the aom category but often near absent from recent nom recognising the exception of tacm arising from the erosion of near surface coal seams karapanagioti et al 2000 tacm that may occur naturally in some near surface sediments or sedimentary rocks e g kleineidam et al 1999 or deposition of fire related particulates thus the aom rich urban riverbed is expected to be tacm rich and increased contaminant sorption and therefore residence times occur compared to pre urban conditions the potential significance of this but not specifically within riverbed settings is underlined by wang et al 2013 who collate pce sorption literature that indicates much higher koc organic carbon partition coefficient values may be justified in na assessment when tacm is present and contaminant concentrations are low i e in the case of the conceptual model we are proposing wang et al 2013 and others allen king et al 2002 arp et al 2009 confirm tacm influenced koc values may be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the empirically determined very widely used us epa 1996 geometric mean koc of 265 l kg a value that better characterises the much lower absorption interaction wang et al 2013 a further consequence of increased sorption is that assumptions on contaminant bioavailability become more critical cornelissen et al 2005 semple et al 2003 contaminants are typically modelled as bioavailable and able to biodegrade when present in the dissolved phase but not when in the sorbed phase hence although increased sorption causes increased riverbed residence time time spent within the dissolved phase remains unaltered resulting in no increase in time opportunity for biodegradation some bioavailability of sorbed contaminant could however lead to much increased timeframes for biodegradation we consider the sensitivity of bioavailability assumptions in the urban riverbed setting we aim to evaluate our hypothesis that increased organic contaminant sorption and therefore residence time occurs in urban riverbed deposits due to the presence of highly sorbing sediment components of anthropogenic origin the influence of the anthropocene is hence proposed significant price et al 2011 our approach involves laboratory batch sorption experiments and sediment organic matter characterisation from a well studied cah groundwater plume discharge zone freitas et al 2015 the study site is located in birmingham the uk s second largest city and one that has a significant industrial heritage the site lies in the headwaters of the river tame arguably the uk s most urbanised catchment lawler et al 2006 similar data were obtained from the river tern which lies about 60 km to the northwest of birmingham in order to provide a rural benchmark against which to compare the urban system data a semi analytical model of riverbed solute transport is then used to explore the implications of the findings 2 study sites 2 1 urban site setting the study reach is located in north west birmingham on the river tame headwaters the catchment covering much of the greater west midlands conurbation fig 1 it is near the western boundary of the triassic sandstone aquifer that underlies birmingham and the upper carboniferous deltaic coal measures sequence that underlies much of the highly urbanised black country region to the west the tame arises in the urban carboniferous and flows eastwards across birmingham the coal measures comprise a complex heavily faulted discontinuous geology with thin c 1 m discrete coal bands often mined out set within a much greater rock mass of layered fractured sandstones siltstones mudstones and conglomerate overlying superficial deposits comprise alluvium with sands and gravels mostly around the river and tributary channels with a wider more extensive coverage of low permeability till in the upper tributary area except in the west around bradley and tipton fig 1 mean flow of the tame at the study site is c 200 ml d with a catchment area upstream of c 220 km2 it is a relatively high energy flashy river

engineering manufacturing underpinned by coal limestone iron ore extraction and smelting in the black country coal mining in the bilston darlaston area upstream present since the 14th century rapidly

has largely focused upon the spatially variable biodegradation of the tce plume occurring within the riverbed freitas et al 2015 2 2 rural comparison site a rural site on the river tern shropshire was selected to provide benchmark comparison with the urban site the tern located 60 km north west of birmingham is a predominantly agricultural catchment of about 880 km2 adams et al 2003 it has many similarities to the tame being a small lowland river in an area of gently rolling topography underlain by and in receipt of baseflow from the east shropshire permo triassic sandstone with a variable covering of quaternary tills sands and alluvium and an annual rainfall of around 700 mm cuthbert et al 2010 the sampling site is at helshaw grange where the river is about 6 m wide with generally steep vegetated banks and is underlain by alluvium and quaternary deposits weatherill et al 2014 riverbed deposits are predominantly fine to medium grained sands with very little gravel but some woody debris flow is about 70 ml d from a catchment of about 93 km2 equivalent to about a third of the flow of the tame site 3 methods 3 1 tame urban catchment riverbed sampling the multilevel sampler network and other study reach infrastructure and sampling methods are detailed by freitas et al 2015 and rivett et al 2008 we describe only the riverbed sediment sampling relevant to the present study retrieval of riverbed samples was challenging due to the well armoured firm and densely packed riverbed nature and frequency of large pebbles and cobbles freitas et al 2015 riverbed sediment samples for foc fraction of organic carbon content and kd sorption soil water partition coefficient determination and for organic matter characterisation in the laboratory were obtained by manual coring and grab sampling cores were obtained using a stainless steel tube 4 6 cm diameter containing a pvc liner tube this was driven into the riverbed using a sledgehammer a rubber bung was inserted into the top of the steel tube and the tubes withdrawn together the plastic tube insert was then removed cut to size and tube ends sealed with wax the success rate of coring was poor although five successful cores were obtained these involved careful selection of locations in areas of softer partially consolidated sediment with few cobbles as such representation of the entirety of sediment types in the tame was not achieved though later freeze coring reported in freitas et al 2015 did provide increased opportunity for inspection of in situ sediment heterogeneity and is exemplified later herein a total of 16 grab samples were taken from the river tame for batch sorption experiments during sediment characterisation and mapping of the riverbed deposits grab samples were obtained of a representative selection of hummock and armoured bedforms also supporting grab samples were obtained with depth in the vicinity of the core sites grab samples were excavated by spade from discrete depth intervals and bagged in containers as rapidly as possible to minimise loss in the flowing water column 3 2 tern rural catchment riverbed sampling seven riverbed cores two of which were used in the current study for kd determination were obtained from the river tern cores were taken from a reach close to that detailed by weatherill et al 2014 and characterised by low flow woody debris materials settled on soft predominantly sandy sediments an eijkelkamp beeker sampler for soft sediments was used to extract cores of sediment where possible for firmer sediments 1 m lengths of plastic tubing 5 cm diameter were driven into the sediment using a fence post driver and core withdrawn under suction by use of a rubber bung inserted at the tubing top around 90 recovery was achieved 3 3 laboratory methods 3 3 1 foc fraction of organic carbon content measurement the foc of sediment samples was measured using the solid sample module of a shimadzu total organic carbon analyser ssm 5000a infrared is used to measure co2 given off during sample combustion to determine sample carbon the solid sample module contains one furnace at 900 c to combust all carbon organic and inorganic and a second at 200 c to combust sample pre treated with phosphoric acid and determine the inorganic carbon fraction the organic carbon is determined by difference prior to analysis the sediments were oven dried for 24 h at 105 c and pulverized using a teema mill until they passed through a 250 μm sieve separate calibrations were performed for total and inorganic carbon tc and ic using respectively glucose 40 c over a range of 0 8 to 30 mg c and sodium carbonate 11 3 c over a range of 0 4 to 20 mg c samples of c 0 1 g were weighed into combustion boats and analysis done in triplicate for both total carbon and inorganic carbon 3 3 2 batch sorption experiments pce was used for batch sorption studies in preference to tce due to its greater hydrophobicity allowing easier measurement and due to the larger literature base e g allen king et al 1995 1998 ball and roberts 1991 rivett and allen king 2003 sediment samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and pulverised using a mortar and pestle until fine enough to pass a 250 μm sieve this reduces the time to reach equilibrium without influencing overall sorption magnitude ball and roberts 1991 sediments were then homogenised using a riffle splitter and divided for use in the batch experiments a series of 40 ml glass vials with ptfe silicone septa closures were filled with a known mass of sediment and synthetic groundwater designed to mimic typical ionic strength and cation proportions of the sandstone groundwaters in birmingham na 13 0 mg l ca2 72 9 mg l mg2 28 0 mg l cl 149 5 mg l so4 2 110 7 mg l vials were completely filled to prevent volatilisation losses and then spiked with a known mass of pce and left to equilibrate after equilibration pce concentrations remaining in the aqueous phase were measured and the amount of pce sorption calculated by difference care was taken to adjust the sediment water ratio so that predicted sorption based on foc would reduce the dissolved concentration by between 20 and 80 thus reducing the relative error in concentration measurements pce stock solutions were prepared by dilution in methanol with spikes below a mole fraction of 10 4 in the aqueous phase to avoid co solvency affects each individual experiment to determine sediment sorption at a given concentration was run as a set of three replicates with one set of vials containing sediment and synthetic groundwater and another two sets containing only synthetic groundwater one set of blank vials was analysed on the day of spiking to determine initial mass injected and the other was analysed along with the sorption vials at the end of the equilibration period 3 days to determine non sediment sorption mass loss day 1 blanks and calibration vials were placed on an orbital shaker table set at 450 motions minute 1 for 30 min before analysis day 3 blanks and sorption vials were placed on a shaker table shaking at 100 motions minute 1 for 3 days vials were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 30 min prior to extraction of the equilibrated aqueous phase pce concentration was determined by head space gc ms batch sorption tests were performed on 6 sediment samples taken from two cores from the rural tern site with each sample split to 3 sub samples to evaluate repeatability on 6 samples taken from two multilevel ml core sites on the urban tame with each sample split to 6 sub samples and 6 grab samples from two urban tame sites pebbly sand and hummock sediments again each sample split to 6 sub samples a single concentration spot wise sorption kd was determined on each sub sample from an initial spike dissolved phase concentration of c 800 µg l pce the value was selected to allow common comparison on samples and multiple sub samples at a moderately elevated concentration of regulatory concern within a discharging plume and was comparable to higher tce concentrations at the tame site an approach that is acknowledged to not permit investigation of sorption linearity proposed in future work pce diffusion into and through the vial septum was deemed the most significant non sorption mass loss that was quantified via the sediment free control vials spiked at c 8 80 and 800 μg l pce concentrations septum mass loss was calculated from the equilibrium rather than initial concentrations similar to allen king et al 1995 following their observation that equilibration of that loss occurs rapidly this loss was subtracted from the initial mass injected into the vial to calculate a new initial mass m 0 sorption was then calculated using allen king et al 1995 1 q m 0 c w v w m s where q is the sorbed concentration mm 1 cw is the aqueous equilibrium concentration vw is the volume of water and ms is the dry mass of solids it is acknowledged that assigning losses to diffusion into the septum may be disputed if sorption to substrates is very rapid and the main sink our sorption parameter estimation is hence regarded conservative but recognises a future work preference for glass ampoule based batch sorption measurements to avoid such uncertainties the sorption soil water partition coefficient kd l3m 1 was then determined using 2 k d q c w recognising sorption of hydrophobic contaminants occurs principally to organic matter distribution coefficients may be normalised by the laboratory measured fraction of organic carbon in the sediment foc to calculate the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient koc karickhoff et al 1979 3 k oc k d f oc for the river tame sediments kd was determined for the 6 grab samples taken from different locations across the river to represent the different sediment types pebbly sand and hummocks and another 6 samples taken with depth at two locations within a silty sandy area of the riverbed that was thought to be a potential location for enhanced na ml1 for the river tern kd samples were selected from different depths of two cores sub sectioned based on their lithology 3 3 3 petrographical characterisation of organic matter the om present in three shallow grab samples from the tame riverbed sediments was petrographically characterised the work was undertaken by a commercial specialist laboratory laop consulting and research tübingen germany laop and is based on methodologies described by jeong et al 2008 kiem et al 2003 and ligouis et al 2005 it is necessary for identifying condensed carbonaceous materials i e tacm for example yang et al 2008a b used similar techniques to investigate the transport of coal derived particle bound hydrophobic pahs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in floodplain soils quantitative microscopical analysis was conducted on polished mounts of organic concentrate produced from hcl and hf acid pre treatment of 90 g of non crushed riverbed sediment sample the analysis was undertaken with a leitz dmrx mpvsp microscope photometer in both reflected white light and uv plus violet light illumination fluorescence mode using an oil immersion objective of 50 magnification and a total magnification of 500 photographs were taken with a wild mps48 photoautomat using a 20 and a 50 oil immersion objective 50 total range of magnification 200 to 500 a scale bar of 20 µm or 50 µm is indicated within the images the analysis permits a quantitative measure of organic matter type with a broad division between nom in recent and ancient sediments and aom as defined earlier 4 results and discussion 4 1 urban study reach riverbed inspection fig 2 shows a map of the tame urban reach riverbed deposits along with sampling locations and relevant site photographs the riverbed predominantly comprises a well armoured cobbly and pebbly sand however from spring to autumn the growth of macrophytes can locally modify the bedform hummocks of fine sandy sediments and organic matter build up under trailing strands of macrophytes such as ranunculus due to the reduced water velocities described by cotton et al 2006 for a site elsewhere sand hummocks were observed up to several metres in length with thicknesses of up to 50 cm their upstream boundaries are curved fig 2 green areas but downstream areas are actively eroding with disconnected eddying often including entrained carbon rich particles the sand is usually grey or buff in colour contrasting with the more oxidised appearance of much of the pebbly sand between hummocks with a centimetre thick darker rim to the upper surface in contrast water flowing around the macrophyte patches is accelerated and flow channels are created where coarser sediments dominate found elsewhere by sand jensen and pedersen 1999 in addition to this increased spatial heterogeneity the seasonal nature of the macrophyte growth leads to a temporal heterogeneity in sediment structure and retention of organic matter even within seasons the sediment distribution can vary with hummocks eroding as well as forming fig 2 photograph bottom left our grab sediment sampling obtained a representative collection of the hummock sediment and the cobbly and pebbly sand because the cobbles were discarded after sampling the cobbly and pebbly sand samples will subsequently be termed the pebbly sand samples further grab riverbed sampling but with depth fig 2 was undertaken adjacent to the location of the ml3 ml6 and ml1 cores the samples obtained being used for determination of foc and kd some of the freeze cores later retrieved from the site freitas et al 2015 are shown in fig 2 and illustrate the significant heterogeneity of the riverbed deposits the cores display an array of poorly sorted deposits albeit with some layering obvious in places with grain size varying from fine silt to cobbles the observation of barbed wire in rusted degraded state at 30 cm below the current riverbed in freeze core fc2 demonstrates the relatively recent age of the deposits sampled for foc and kd determination our infrequent observations spanning around a decade have observed changes in the reach bedform locally due to accumulation of both natural and anthropogenic debris and flood scouring further indicating the dynamic nature of this urban riverbed environment 4 2 foc data table 1 summarises foc data obtained comprising a total of 5 cores and 16 grab samples for the urban tame site and 7 cores for the rural tern the data indicate means and ranges for the various sediment types that broadly accord with the relative expectation of foc contents for the sediment types sampled for example the pebbly sands of the tame and sands of the tern have low foc values often 1 whilst the hummock sediments under the tame macrophyte stands and the tern organic rich units have the highest values up to 21 for each sediment type the arithmetic mean and geometric mean foc are reasonably comparable the means of all river tern samples is somewhat misleading as the estimates are drawn from two contrasting populations i e low foc sands to which the geometric mean tends and high foc organic rich units to which the arithmetic mean tends the mean foc values for the various sediment types table 1 are generally within or approaching the range reported by clarke and wharton 2001 for other lowland english rivers 0 6 to 9 1 observed riverbed foc values are much larger than adjoining aquifer values the triassic sandstone that underlies both the tame and tern exhibits a typical range of 0 01 to 0 15 steventon barnes 2001 thornton et al 2000 shepherd et al 2002 the riverbed deposit foc values are hence 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater than the sandstones and confirm the general expectation given a preliminary assumption similar koc values apply of much greater retardation occurring in the riverbed sediments vertical profiles of tame riverbed indicate foc was quite elevated at 0 5 to 7 fig 3 the core profiles which cover a depth interval from 0 to 20 25 cm below the riverbed show some significant differences despite their relative proximity fig 2 ml6 has low foc throughout c 0 6 whilst both ml1 and ml3 exhibit higher values declining with depth from 4 to 2 and 6 5 to 1 5 respectively the shallowest 0 10 cm depth ml1 sample is described as soft brown grey fine grained sand and silt with visible organic matter particles present that are well degraded and dark brown black in colour as well as some woody debris this contrasts with the shallowest ml6 sample described as mainly pebbles 60 with medium coarse grained brown sand and gravel and no visible organic matter the 2 cm increment ml3 data illustrate the foc heterogeneity whilst not all high foc strata are always obvious visually the organic rich unit seen at 10 15 cm depth in the photo log of ml3 in fig 3 corresponds with the foc 7 peak this compares to the shallow pebbly sand grab samples table 1 with little obvious organic content that had foc values of 0 3 to 1 7 and arithmetic and geometric means of around 0 8 this sample material with cobbles removed represents the very shallow armoured pebble cobble deposit evident across much of the reach see fig 2 incl photograph samples of hummock sediment exhibited foc spanning the riverbed range 1 6 table 1 the field description of the 6 sample included visible well degraded consolidated organic matter as well as larger fragments of organic detritus the foc range accords with our observation of organic rich rims especially and less organic parts of the hummocks and also sand sized particles of coal like material deposited in the eddying downstream wakes of the hummocks the rural tern core samples used subsequently for laboratory determination of kd were from the mid to high range of foc values table 1 for core 1 7 15 19 and 6 and for core 2 15 and 16 with increasing depths these samples are organic rich units of what appear to be relatively recent depositional origin 4 3 pce batch sorption studies 4 3 1 kd and koc estimates results of the pce batch sorption studies are summarised in the fig 4 plot of experimentally observed sample kd values versus foc gradients representing the sediment koc eq 3 an approximately linear increase of kd with foc was observed for each sample type except ml6 that showed too little variation in foc to make a meaningful evaluation in this regard koc was greatest for sample ml1 at 7370 l kg corresponding to a fine grained sand and silt a softer sediment area below an overhanging tree partially protected from the main river flow fig 2 whilst the pebbly sand has a low foc compared to some of the high foc hummock sediments data for both display similar gradients in fig 3 with comparable koc calculated of 1530 l kg and 1950 l kg koc similarity suggests these sediments both from the shallow riverbed and certainly very recently deposited in the case of the hummock samples contain similar organic material fig 5 shows calculated koc values eq 3 plotted against foc for the urban tame and rural tern samples including sub sample open symbol and mean sample filled symbol estimates discussion below focuses upon the mean data but noting that sub sample variation is shown to be least for the ml1 and ml6 tame riverbed core with a standard deviation of 5 59 of the mean compared to 15 5 for the rural tern samples and 24 3 for the pebbly sand and hummock tame samples the fig 5 plot adopts a similar format to the second figure in wang et al 2013 including reference koc lines for the us epa 1996 geometric mean 265 l kg alongside empirical solubility and kow octanol water partition coefficient based estimates of koc these latter estimates are calculated using the approach of wang et al 2013 derived from linear solvation energy or hydrophobic partitioning theory schwarzenbach et al 2003 with the exception of some pebbly sand samples all of the tame riverbed sample koc mean estimates are at least double the us epa 1996 koc at over 500 l kg with most samples over 1000 l kg the koc values for the low foc content ml6 samples are elevated at c 2000 4000 l kg approaching the maximum study values of c 7000 l kg found for ml1 in contrast to the elevated urban sample koc values fig 5 shows a clustering of the rural river tern samples close to the us epa geometric mean tern data for cores 1 and 2 have sample based koc arithmetic and geometric means of 241 and 245 l kg respectively drawing on the discussion of wang et al 2013 the us epa geometric mean of 265 l kg is expected to be valid when applied to modern sediments that have quite high foc and or when high pce concentrations tending to solubility are present studies that contributed to the us epa value tended to accord with these criteria under these conditions absorption partitioning is dominant since any of the limited adsorption sites will have become saturated the us epa value compares well to the koc derived from both solubility and kow this consistency endorses the us epa value for sediments where absorption partitioning is dominant for pce it is concluded from the similarity of the tern sample koc estimates with the us epa koc estimates that absorption is predominant this is entirely reasonable based on of the fact that the rural tern samples are unlikely to contain significant quantities of tacm and are likely to be dominated by recent nom unlike the rural sediments most of the urban sediments have koc estimates well above the us epa mean fig 5 providing strong evidence of adsorption contributions our urban koc values are similar to the pce estimates of wang et al 2013 that show that the majority of tacm samples plot in the 1000 10 000 l kg koc range comparing to wang et al s figure 2a b plots of 5 and 5000 µg l pce data bracketing our concentrations we conclude our urban riverbed sediments exhibit significant and varying adsorption contributions that are highly likely to be attributable to the variable presence and or type of tacm due to the variability in the urban koc calculated arithmetic and geometric mean koc values for all the urban tame data of 2840 and 1770 l kg respectively somewhat differ fig 5 greater sample numbers are necessary to more fully comment on the statistical nature of the urban distribution 4 3 2 r estimates fig 6 plots calculated retardation factor r estimates for pce from the batch kd data as a function of sediment foc based on the standard relationship 4 r 1 ρ b k d η where ρ b is the dry bulk density of the sediment and η its porosity to which nominal representative values are respectively allocated of 1 855 kg l and 0 3 reference r lines are calculated for the sample arithmetic and geometric means of the tame and tern data and for the us epa geometric mean koc point kd mean and the trend line for the rural tern data lie very close to the us epa estimate fig 6 r ranges from 80 for the low foc 5 5 up to 400 for the maximum foc 19 the only tame sample close to the us epa trend line is a pebbly sand sample this yields the study minimum r of just 4 6 arising from its low foc 0 3 these r estimates relate to sediments where sorption appears to be dominated by absorption to recent nom the agreement supports that use of the us epa geometric mean koc combined with a measured tern riverbed foc should provide a reliable prediction of retardation occurring in these rural riverbed sediments the geometric mean for the full tern foc dataset generates an r estimate of 24 the arithmetic mean influenced by some elevated foc values realises an r of 71 and the maximum tern foc yields an r of 340 the variation is illustrative of the sensitivity of retardation to the magnitude and spatial variability of foc within the riverbed by way of comparison the triassic sandstone aquifer foc range reported earlier of 0 01 to 0 15 generates very low r estimates of 1 2 to 3 5 pce velocities through the rural tern riverbed sediments are hence 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those in the adjoining sandstone aquifer it is obvious from fig 6 that the us epa koc forms a very poor basis for the prediction of the observed r estimates for the urban samples it would generally lead to very significant underestimation of the urban sample r the seven samples that have foc in the range 0 3 to 0 9 are illustrative of the poor predictability of r from foc data using a single literature koc the us epa koc would predict r in the range 6 to 16 for these sediments yet actual r estimates from laboratory kd data range from 4 6 to 155 the arithmetic and geometric mean tame sediment r lines are around an order of magnitude above the us epa r estimate the greatest r values for the ml1 samples which had a moderate foc of 2 to 4 less than tern samples were estimated at 715 to 1620 for which the us epa trend line would have returned r values of 34 to 67 the underestimation of r when using the us epa koc values suggests a greater degree of sorption an observation consistent with the presence of tacm review of all the urban points in fig 6 is suggestive of a broadly increasing r with increasing foc emerging from lower values of foc and r being relatively close to us epa trendline this observation is the basis of using a simple mixing model to describe the relationship whereby sorption is assumed to occur to a mix of recent nom and tacm sorption to the nom proportion of the foc is characterised by assuming the us epa koc applies and to the remaining proportion of tacm of the foc that the koc observed to fit the maximum foc values applies a mixed kd may hence be calculated and substituted into eq 4 to calculate the trend in r with foc based upon 5 k d f oc n o m k oc n o m f oc t a c m k oc t a c m two mixing relationship lines are shown in fig 6 that encompass the urban samples a lower line approximately fits the hummock sediment samples and assumes foc nom is fixed at 0 7 point of departure from the us epa trend line and foc tacm fully accounts for the increased foc value above this point with the koc tacm assumed to be 1800 l kg and is close the tame geometric mean koc also plotted to which it approximately converges the higher mixing line that approximates the deeper riverbed more sorbing ml1 and ml6 sediment samples assumes a fixed foc nom of 0 4 and a koc tacm of 8000 l kg that provides an estimation of the koc applicable to the tacm whilst it is arguable as to the assigned foc proportions the foc nom may be underestimated the mixed line profiles do nevertheless provide a valid descriptor of the observed urban r variations fig 7 adopts a similar style to fig 6 but focuses on the ml3 dataset for which only foc and no kd data were obtained fig 3 various koc can be assigned to estimate a kd and r the figure shows trend lines for r and the individual ml3 data points that reflect the foc variability in the core based on i the us epa 1996 koc representing an absorption dominated sediment ii geometric mean urban tame koc and iii maximum urban tame koc within each of these estimates the arithmetic and geometric mean r estimates for the ml3 profile are highlighted the plot illustrates the vast range in r that may result for these different bounding koc assumptions it highlights not only the greater than an order of magnitude variation in r that may result from different selection of koc but also for a given koc that the range in r also approaches an order of magnitude due to the variability of foc cf fig 3 the absence of any ml3 kd data is a significant handicap to confidently predicting the riverbed deposit properties here the prudent choice would probably be the selection of the geometric mean tame urban koc retardation of the lesser chlorinated cahs often present at sites including the study site freitas et al 2015 will be reduced compared to pce due to their lower hydrophobicity and sorption potential as a first approximation indicative r or kd or koc estimates may be generated based on solubility scaling methods as used by rivett and allen king 2003 to account for their reduced hydrophobicity tce is around a factor of 5 and cdce cis dichloroethene and vc vinyl chloride around an order of magnitude more soluble than pce r estimates for the lesser chlorinated cahs may be anticipated to be reduced by around these factors as a crude first estimate relative sorption may also be made from studies examining sorption for several cah for example lu et al 2011 provide kd for the above cah on clayey tills that approximately scale with hydrophobicity commensurate with the above expectations noting their dataset foc 0 02 0 08 and pce kd 0 84 2 45 l kg are around the minima of data reported herein 4 4 organic petrography the three shallow grab samples from the tame riverbed sediments examined using organic petrographic techniques laop were obtained from deposits with the following characteristics a brown grey fine grained ml1 sand and silt with visible om fragments present such as leaves and woody debris less well degraded than found in the upper 10 cm sample ml1 10 15 cm a brown grey fine medium grained hummock sand and silt with visible well degraded consolidated om as well as larger fragments of organic detritus grab sample 5 a yellow brown pebbly sand from the armoured riverbed with no visible om grab sample 8 before organic petrographic examination any large clasts organic or otherwise were removed from the sample leaving the granular matrix this procedure avoided the possibility of for example a large woody fragment dominating any given sample table 2 summarises the much more detailed tabulation of data provided by laop the table subdivides to the general categories of recent nom and aom the latter includes significant tacm it may be construed arguable as to whether all items under aom are truly anthropogenic for example hard coal variously elevated in table 2 samples may potentially have some natural geogenic origin arising from river or run off erosion of near surface coal seams most seams will however be either protected by alluvial or glacial sediments within or near the tame or else mined long ago due to their shallowness and ease of access coal related om found in the riverbed has much more likely arisen from coal particle release associated with the recent centuries of intense mining operations spoil tip leaching and abandoned workings and rebounding mine water overflows as well as more general industrial urban anthropogenic activity although a rural catchment overlying coal measures may provide a more rigorous background comparator to assess relative influence of anthropogenic versus geogenic natural release of coal particles most if not all such catchments in the uk are highly urbanised and extensively mined table 2 confirms that the proportion of nom within the greater sediment om was small ranging from 5 2 to 14 7 with the majority being gelified or non gelified woody phytoclast material tissues structureless humic detritus the hummock sand sample is almost certainly negatively biased as larger om fragments described above were omitted and the sample largely reflects the macrophyte filtered riverine sediment all sediments are dominated by the aom comprising 85 95 of the om table 2 nearly all types of anthropogenic particles in laop s classification system were found to be present suggesting a diversity of om input to the tame the principal sources of the om particles found appear to be from coal mining or coal processing cokes residues and solids produced during coal hydrogenation processes hard coal accounts for 28 53 alongside high levels of residues of coal hydrogenation at 23 37 contribution to the former from natural erosion of coal is possible but likely very limited relative to the anthropogenic mediated contribution from the historic coal mining activity parker 2015 the residue percentages are probably an overestimate table 2 footnote as they also include soot from traffic and oil combustion which are likely to be present due to the high density of major and minor roads in the vicinity of the river there is some evidence of coal and petroleum derived fluorescent materials at 1 9 these will include tar oils and lubricants the greatest quantity being found in the pebbly sand i e the shallow armoured riverbed deposit a selection of petrographic images is shown for the hummock and pebbly sand samples in fig 8 and fig 9 see crelling and rimmer 2015 for relevant terminology these again are from a database of many images provided by laop and are selected to provide an illustration of the diversity of om types encountered but do not provide comprehensive coverage with the exception of the lower right images in both figures of nom examples the other images illustrate the diversity of the tacm dominated organic matter aom found the images cover various forms of coal coke char and soots added to these are several images of coal tar a viscous napl produced in the past at town gas or coal carbonisation works aka manufactured gas plants not infrequently located in the vicinity of rivers or canals and a key target of land remediation programmes in the past two decades the size of most anthropogenic particles observed is relatively large and is speculatively ascribed to potentially short transport distances from the sources most of the coal particles are described as very fresh with limited or no weathering the above observations are consistent with the catchment s mining related industrial past section 2 1 the organic petrography confirms the predominance of aom over nom in addition it demonstrates the significant occurrence of tacm essential to the argument of section 4 3 2 that the sorption properties observed are due to the presence of anthropogenic carbon the diversity of om shown by the images figs 8 and 9 in particular highlight that tacm based sorbents in the urban environment are heterogeneous with solid particulate and even liquid napl phases present of contrasting size surface area surface nature and anticipated microporosity of some tacm 5 illustrative modelling to explore implications 5 1 approach to investigate the implications of the modified description of riverbed sediment sorption some illustrative modelling has been undertaken using pce as the example contaminant the aims of the work were to investigate the residence time effect on na using our revised understanding of sorption behaviour in urban riverbed deposits for the modelled riverbed sections a common porosity and groundwater flux was specified dissolved phase pce solute was injected continuously the selected flow and transport parameters are given in table 3 these values are appropriate for saturated groundwater discharge from an underlying aquifer up into a river as encountered in the tame and the tern the values are based on data obtained for the study site freitas et al 2015 and the greater reach study by ellis and rivett 2007 the layered heterogeneity of kd is represented directly for the urban tame cores ml1 and ml6 based on the profile data presented in fig 3 a similar approach is taken for the rural tern core 1 with kd data for 4 discrete intervals the urban tame core ml3 foc results 13 discrete intervals fig 3 were used as a basis for illustrating the sensitivity of residence times to koc selection arithmetic average koc values from the tern core 1 269 l kg similar to the us epa 1996 geometric mean and from the tame 2844 l kg were used the conventional advection dispersion retardation degradation approach was used with a linear equilibrium isotherm r eq 4 biodegradation sensitivity was assessed through a range of nominal degradation rates half life 10 100 1000 d and no decay reflecting the site specific nature of biodegradation model runs were undertaken to evaluate bioavailability influence by assuming i biodegradation only occurred when in the dissolved phase i e the sorbed phase contaminant was not bioavailable and ii biodegradation occurred in both dissolved and sorbed phases case i was accomplished simply by scaling the aqueous half life by r case ii is recognised as probably not realistic but nevertheless permits simulation of a maximum degradation extreme scenario there are no exact solutions for the layered system even in 1 d and so either numerical modelling or semi analytical approaches are required a numerical modelling approach would be computationally intensive to ensure fully converged solutions we have instead used a laplace transform approach with numerical inversion of the solution to the resulting ordinary differential equation ode robinson and hodgkinson 1987 we have evaluated the solution at the end of the sediment core profile for selected times to construct the breakthrough curve the inversion is accomplished using talbot s 1979 method utilising his recommended contour shape parameters and ensuring convergence of the integration scheme by checking a 128 point integration scheme against the 64 point solution used each discrete section in the profile can be solved in laplace transform space simply as a second order ode with an exponentially growing and declining term we select the exponentially declining term which is suitable for the requirement that concentration would tend to zero at infinity in a semi infinite section the output flux from each layer is passed as the inlet flux to the subsequent layer and the output flux from the final layer converted back to a concentration this leads to an extremely efficient scheme for simulating layered heterogeneous one dimensional systems it does not allow for back dispersion between adjacent sections which is not unphysical for systems such as considered here where concentration gradients are always negative the approach is implemented in an excel spreadsheet tool using visual basic for applications vba for the function evaluations in s space and the numerical integration in the complex plane case 2014 5 2 simulations evaluating sorption influence upon residence times the contrast between urban tame and rural tern riverbed deposit pce sorption behaviour is illustrated in fig 10 all simulations adopt a half life of degradation of 10 d that is only active when the contaminant is present in the dissolved phase simulated profiles with symbol markers are for the riverbed core having laboratory kd based sorption parameter values these show earliest breakthrough for the urban tame ml6 core this is largely a consequence of the low foc of the profile out weighing the effects of its relatively high koc the next breakthrough is predicted to be for the rural tern core 1 which in contrast with the tame core has a high foc and a low koc though the breakthrough is delayed relative to the tame ml6 core the travel distance is around 50 longer and the pce velocities are similar the tern core contrasts with the tame core in having a high foc but low koc the most retarded breakthrough of the cases using the laboratory parameter values is for the tame ml1 core in this case breakthrough to c co 0 5 takes around 2300 d and to equilibrium breakthrough about 5000 d compared to around 500 d for the ml6 core both these profiles ultimately plateau around the same concentration which is a consequence of degradation just occurring in the dissolved phase where they spend similar times the significant retardation of the ml1 case is due to its very high koc and moderately high foc resulting in r values over 1000 fig 6 the pce breakthrough over this thin 19 cm riverbed deposit occurs over a period of 2 to 14 years from the arrival of the pce at the base of the deposit this is much greater than the groundwater travel time of 2 days it is quite probable that the ml1 deposits have a hydraulic conductivity up to at least an order of magnitude lower than modelled thus making the residence times even greater it is clear that pce residence within even thin 20 cm riverbed sediments may be measured in decades though this presumes that the sediment and solid phase om lifetimes are also at least similarly large the dashed curves lacking markers in fig 10 are for tame core ml3 which has a variable foc fig 3 the curves presented are for a range of koc values that might be used in practice the sensitivity to koc is seen to be significant in that the curves presented include breakthrough times both faster rural tern koc us epa koc and slower tame ml1 arithmetic mean koc than any of the systems so far discussed the simulations show clearly the significant error in residence times predicted when using the us epa 1996 koc inappropriately where tacm is a significant contributor to the foc 5 3 simulations evaluating bioavailability assumptions fig 11 illustrates the sensitivity to the bioavailability assumption using the ml3 core length 28 cm four of the curves lacking markers are for the low koc absorption dominant case with different decay constants the fifth is for decay in the aqueous phase only breakthrough is rapid for the no decay and aqueous only decay cases the latter rising nearly to input concentrations c co 1 despite a half life of only 10d it is clear that for the system studied decay occurring only in the aqueous phase is unlikely to affect attenuation significantly the other 3 curves lacking markers show however the significant influence of allowing contaminant decay of the sorbed pce even a long half life of 1000 d causes the equilibrium concentration to drop to 0 9c co a 100 d half life results in an equilibrium concentration of 0 4c co and no breakthrough i e complete attenuation is seen in the case of a 10d half life the latter result is in complete contrast to the 10 d half life case where decay occurs only in the aqueous phase and equilibrium relative concentrations were close to unity c co 0 98 the significance of the bioavailability assumption is hence clear the curves with markers in fig 11 are for the high koc adsorption dominant case and show delayed breakthrough in all cases due to the increased sorption rise to c co 1 for the no decay case now requires about 4000 d compared to 400 d for the low koc case the 10 d half life applied to just the aqueous phase results in only modest attenuation with a 0 8c co plateau the influence of allowing biodegradation of the sorbed phase causes even a very long half life of 1000 d to attenuate the breakthrough to a 0 4c co plateau a 100 d half life was required to achieve this equilibrium concentration for the low koc case a 100 d half life results in complete attenuation and no breakthrough hence as expected the significance of the bioavailability assumption is even more apparent in the more highly sorbing case the models illustrate quantitatively that even quite a long half life may result in complete attenuation of breakthrough if a sorbed phase has bioavailability but even very short half lives may have very limited effects if degradation occurs only in the aqueous phase without resolution of this assumption predictions could range from complete breakthrough to none at all 6 conclusions greater pce sorption and therefore increased residence time occurred in the study s urban riverbed deposits than in the study s rural riverbed deposits this was shown to be due to the presence of highly sorbing sediments containing organic matter rich in tacm of anthropogenic origin the evidence for this was obtained from pce batch sorption experiments and om characterisation of riverbed sediments from urban and rural sites the implications of the findings were quantitatively investigated by modelling which showed the contrast that may occur between urban and rural riverbed deposit residence times and also the substantial sensitivity to bioavailability assumptions sorption in the rural riverbed sediments is controlled by the presence of recent om to which absorption partitioning may occur this process is very well predicted using the us epa 1996 empirical koc e for pce whilst koc values are relatively low due to the presence of natural organic matter sorption in this lowland low velocity rural river is relatively high due to the sediment s high foc in contrast the urban riverbed sediments were found to exhibit much more variable but often significantly higher koc than the rural sediment and us epa koc values koc values in the urban deposits are typically around an order of magnitude or more greater than in the rural deposits and are similar to literature koc values for tacm where sorption is attributed to adsorption rather than absorption this presence of tacm was confirmed by organic petrography analysis that showed that the urban riverbed sediment om was dominated by a diversity of tacm materials with a high proportion of coal coke and coal hydrogenation residue this material can be attributed to river transport of particles released from extensive up catchment coal mining coal mining related industry e g coal gasification smelting and road discharges amongst other potential urban inputs it is concluded from the sorption data and modelling results that the presence of tacm in urban riverbed deposits may result in order of magnitude increases in pce residence times this would mean that years to a decade or more may be required for pce to breakthrough through even thin c 25 cm riverbed deposits where groundwater requires only days under the standard assumption that the sorbed contaminant is not bioavailable biodegardation in the dissolved phase occurs for such a limited proportion of time in highly sorbing sediments that attenuation of breakthrough is insignificant unless the half life is very low in such highly sorbing systems the assumptions on bioavailability become critical if biodegradation occurs in the sorbed phase even moderate to quite long half lives may cause complete attenuation of a discharging contaminant plume overall contaminant residence times within urban riverbed environments may be expected to vary greatly with significant sensitivity to sorption and biodegradation occurrence and bioavailability controls whilst the catchment is one of the most urbanised in the uk it is reasonably anticipated that many catchments around the world will be sufficiently urbanised that similar enhanced sorption of cah and other organic contaminants may be occurring due to the presence of tacm longer histories of anthropogenic activity perhaps dating back to the 18th century industrial revolution or prior may generate greater accumulated thicknesses of tacm within a riverbed the anthropocene period may hence be expected to have a considerable influence upon modern day contaminant residence time and fate within an urban riverbed sediments impacted by urban pollution or activities that have a significant presence of tacm cannot be assumed to have the property values usually assigned to other quaternary sediments a yet further consequence of contaminant accumulation in high sorption potential sediments is that sudden release of this stored pollutant may occur with sediment re suspension during flood events resulting in particle facilitated contaminant transport and possible significant influence upon river water quality schwientek et al 2013 rügner et al 2013 2019 future research is needed to determine how tacm amounts can be estimated in a practicable way in riverbed deposits to delineate the spatial distribution and depth in the riverbed of the elevated tacm high sorption layer and its dynamic movement during flood events and to establish the bioavailability of contaminants sorbed to both nom and tacm related system complexities also require assessment including non linearity of sorption with concentration and sorptive partitioning interactions with bacterial cell compartments and or exopolymeric substances of varying hydrophobicity leitner et al 2018 renpenning et al 2015 whilst tacm is relatively recalcitrant and not expected to act as an electron donor in cah biodegradation it can clearly cause significant increases in contaminant residence times it is hence necessary to establish if prolonged residence times coupled with supply of labile dom electron donors from surface water penetration of the sediments freitas et al 2015 alongside some labile nom already present in the sediments is sufficient to result in biodegradation of adsorbed and or absorbed contaminants

8611,this study evaluates the hypothesis that increased organic contaminant sorption and hence residence time in urban riverbed deposits may occur due to the presence of highly sorbing sediment components of anthropogenic origin that contain thermally altered carbonaceous materials tacm the hypothesis was confirmed through laboratory batch studies examining tetrachloroethene pce sorption on riverbed sediment samples from the highly urbanised river tame headwaters catchment birmingham uk and the river tern shropshire providing a nearby rural benchmark urban riverbed sorption was elevated with observed organic carbon partition coefficient koc values over an order of magnitude greater than rural values the latter compare to the widely used us epa geometric mean koc and attributed to absorption dominated partitioning into recent natural organic matter use of that mean is inappropriate for the urban riverbed potentially underestimating retardation by an order of magnitude organic petrography confirmed the urban riverbed contained a high proportion of tacm rich organic matter particles to which significant adsorption might be expected furthermore elevated urban koc values were consistent with tacm rich sediment literature estimates the tacm source appears to be riverine transport of particulate matter from historical industrial urban or coal mining processing activities prevalent upstream since the industrial revolution consequences of the increased urban riverbed residence time on attenuation and bioavailability assumption sensitivities were modelled under the standard assumption of sorbed contaminant being non bioavailable rapid rates of aqueous phase biodegradation are necessary for complete attenuation within a riverbed conversely if adsorbed contaminant is bioavailable then complete attenuation is probable where highly adsorbing anthropocene urban riverbed sediments are present even for long half lives therefore anthropocene sediment occurrence may significantly influence modern day contaminant fate within the urban riverbed the principal implication being greatly increased sorption and residence times may occur in urban riverbeds than conventionally assumed further research should focus upon whether adsorbed contaminants have any bioavailability causing increased contaminant flux attenuation and surface water quality protection keywords urban riverbed sediments sorption bioavailability anthropocene chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs 1 introduction the residence time of groundwater organic contaminants in riverbed

krause et al 2017 represents a key research focal point within the greater subsurface hydrological system residence de dreuzy and ginn 2016 our study focuses upon chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs that include the notorious groundwater contaminants trichloroethene tce and tetrachloroethene pce prominence of these solvents not only relates to their ubiquitous historical use for degreasing but also their dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl properties resulting in deep aquifer penetration and subsurface persistence rivett et al 2014 yang et al 2018 this persistence coupled with often limited na may result in continuous discharge of plumes to surface waters ellis and rivett 2007 mcguire et al 2004 rønde et al 2017 weatherill et al 2014 site studies on these discharging plumes and associated laboratory studies have often focused upon biodegradation the key mass loss attenuation process atashgahi et al 2017 freitas et al 2015 lee and lee 2015 weatherill et al 2018 we however contend that sorption of discharging cah plumes in urban riverbeds demands closer scrutiny urban anthropogenic influences over decades or even centuries of the anthropocene will have led to modification of the riverbed deposits potentially causing them to have different sorption properties from those present under pre urban conditions sorption predominantly occurs to organic matter om within the riverbed sediments this material may be comprised of natural organic matter nom as well as anthropogenic organic matter aom arising from anthropogenic activities allen king et al 2002 cornelissen and gustafsson 2004 cornelissen et al 2005 grathwohl 1990 jeong et al 2008 kleineidam et al 1999 smith and lerner 2008 nom within a riverbed setting may include gelified or non gelified woody phytoclast tissues and structureless humic fulvic detritus peat seed coatings bark root pollen spores lignin and fungal material whilst such materials may exist in ancient sediments within riverbed settings nom is typically of recent origin due to its labile nature definition of aom is more contentious it includes om whose nature has changed due to anthropogenic activity notably heating to produce thermally altered carbonaceous material tacm allen king et al 2002 jeong et al 2008 it is also taken herein to include om that occurs in the riverbed as a consequence of anthropogenic influence typically urban industrial historical activity coal particles arising from mining activity exemplify the latter aom may thus include hard coals coke mostly formed from coal carbonisation soot from traffic or oil combustion char mostly from coal combustion residues from coal carbonisation and coal and petroleum derived fluorescent materials tar oils and lubricants organic contaminated sediments and globules of dense non aqueous phase liquids napls grathwohl 1990 cornelissen et al 2005 sources include poorly controlled industrial effluent mining and sewage discharges urban runoff illegal dumping and contaminated baseflows sorption includes both partitioning absorption and adsorption of organic contaminants on the various forms of om in the sediment allen king et al 2002 wang et al 2013 the absorption domain consists of amorphous organic matter such as humic and fulvic substances and lignin the absorption process is conceptualised as contaminant hydrophobic phase partitioning into the om phase and is characterised by linear isotherms karickhoff et al 1979 in contrast adsorption occurs to more condensed organic matter with in particular tacm exhibiting very strong non linear adsorption allen king et al 2002 cornelissen and gustafsson 2004 allen king et al 2002 define tacm to encompass non carbonate carbon containing matter that includes carbonaceous matter cm forms created by combustion and pyrolysis processes such as soot and char as well as by geological processes diagenesis and catagenesis such as coal and kerogen allen king et al 2002 wang et al 2013 tacm is particularly hydrophobic and rich in adsorption sites due to its very high surface area micro porosity greater aromaticity and lower o c and h c ratios compared to non thermally altered parent material allen king et al 2002 cornelissen et al 2005 wang et al 2013 critically tacm is prevalent within the aom category but often near absent from recent nom recognising the exception of tacm arising from the erosion of near surface coal seams karapanagioti et al 2000 tacm that may occur naturally in some near surface sediments or sedimentary rocks e g kleineidam et al 1999 or deposition of fire related particulates thus the aom rich urban riverbed is expected to be tacm rich and increased contaminant sorption and therefore residence times occur compared to pre urban conditions the potential significance of this but not specifically within riverbed settings is underlined by wang et al 2013 who collate pce sorption literature that indicates much higher koc organic carbon partition coefficient values may be justified in na assessment when tacm is present and contaminant concentrations are low i e in the case of the conceptual model we are proposing wang et al 2013 and others allen king et al 2002 arp et al 2009 confirm tacm influenced koc values may be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the empirically determined very widely used us epa 1996 geometric mean koc of 265 l kg a value that better characterises the much lower absorption interaction wang et al 2013 a further consequence of increased sorption is that assumptions on contaminant bioavailability become more critical cornelissen et al 2005 semple et al 2003 contaminants are typically modelled as bioavailable and able to biodegrade when present in the dissolved phase but not when in the sorbed phase hence although increased sorption causes increased riverbed residence time time spent within the dissolved phase remains unaltered resulting in no increase in time opportunity for biodegradation some bioavailability of sorbed contaminant could however lead to much increased timeframes for biodegradation we consider the sensitivity of bioavailability assumptions in the urban riverbed setting we aim to evaluate our hypothesis that increased organic contaminant sorption and therefore residence time occurs in urban riverbed deposits due to the presence of highly sorbing sediment components of anthropogenic origin the influence of the anthropocene is hence proposed significant price et al 2011 our approach involves laboratory batch sorption experiments and sediment organic matter characterisation from a well studied cah groundwater plume discharge zone freitas et al 2015 the study site is located in birmingham the uk s second largest city and one that has a significant industrial heritage the site lies in the headwaters of the river tame arguably the uk s most urbanised catchment lawler et al 2006 similar data were obtained from the river tern which lies about 60 km to the northwest of birmingham in order to provide a rural benchmark against which to compare the urban system data a semi analytical model of riverbed solute transport is then used to explore the implications of the findings 2 study sites 2 1 urban site setting the study reach is located in north west birmingham on the river tame headwaters the catchment covering much of the greater west midlands conurbation fig 1 it is near the western boundary of the triassic sandstone aquifer that underlies birmingham and the upper carboniferous deltaic coal measures sequence that underlies much of the highly urbanised black country region to the west the tame arises in the urban carboniferous and flows eastwards across birmingham the coal measures comprise a complex heavily faulted discontinuous geology with thin c 1 m discrete coal bands often mined out set within a much greater rock mass of layered fractured sandstones siltstones mudstones and conglomerate overlying superficial deposits comprise alluvium with sands and gravels mostly around the river and tributary channels with a wider more extensive coverage of low permeability till in the upper tributary area except in the west around bradley and tipton fig 1 mean flow of the tame at the study site is c 200 ml d with a catchment area upstream of c 220 km2 it is a relatively high energy flashy river frequently engineered to drain the west midlands more efficiently 2 1 1 urban influence upon riverbed sediments the study area has been subject to significant urban influence with the industrial revolution foundational to the diverse industrial urban landscape that emerged over the 18th to 20th centuries thomas and tellam 2006 birmingham was internationally renowned as a centre of metals and engineering manufacturing underpinned by coal limestone iron ore extraction and smelting in the black country coal mining in the bilston darlaston area upstream present since the 14th century rapidly expanded in the 17th 18th centuries before declining in the 19th century with over 130 mines closing during 1860 to 1928 in bilston alone lawler et al 2006 coal exploitation left not only a significant abandoned mines legacy but considerable contaminated land from smelting coal carbonisation coking gasworks and heavy industry activity parker 2015 heavy industry decline to a more service based economy has occurred since the 1960s with significant land remediation activity and re development following surface water quality has been impacted by this heritage ellis and rivett 2007

decades later rosenthal 2007 around 80 of the tame dry weather flow in the late 20th century was attributed to effluent discharge nra 1996 whilst industrial effluent pipe discharges to the tame have

abandoned coal mine discharges anthropogenic contamination of riverbed sediments in the study reach is inevitable regarding groundwater plume discharges widespread and persistent contamination of the birmingham aquifer by cahs has been observed since the 1980s but may stem from releases dating back to the 1930s rivett et al 2012 our 50 m long study reach forms the most upstream reach on the tame observed to be contaminated by cah groundwater plume discharges in the survey by ellis and rivett 2007 of the 7 km of river reach crossing the birmingham unconfined sandstone fig 1 work at the site has largely focused upon the spatially variable biodegradation of the tce plume occurring within the riverbed freitas et al 2015 2 2 rural comparison site a rural site on the river tern shropshire was selected to provide benchmark comparison with the urban site the tern located 60 km north west of birmingham is a predominantly agricultural catchment of about 880 km2 adams et al 2003 it has many similarities to the tame being a small lowland river in an area of gently rolling topography underlain by and in receipt of baseflow from the east shropshire permo triassic sandstone with a variable covering of quaternary tills sands and alluvium and an annual rainfall of around 700 mm cuthbert et al 2010 the sampling site is at helshaw grange where the river is about 6 m wide with generally steep vegetated banks and is underlain by alluvium and quaternary deposits weatherill et al 2014 riverbed deposits are predominantly fine to medium grained sands with very little gravel but some woody debris flow is about 70 ml d from a catchment of about 93 km2 equivalent to about a third of the flow of the tame site 3 methods 3 1 tame urban catchment riverbed sampling the multilevel sampler network and other study reach infrastructure and sampling methods are detailed by freitas et al 2015 and rivett et al 2008 we describe only the riverbed sediment sampling relevant to the present study retrieval of riverbed samples was challenging due to the well armoured firm and densely packed riverbed nature and frequency of large pebbles and cobbles freitas et al 2015 riverbed sediment samples for foc fraction of organic carbon content and kd sorption soil water partition coefficient determination and for organic matter characterisation in the laboratory were obtained by manual coring and grab sampling cores were obtained using a stainless steel tube 4 6 cm diameter containing a pvc liner tube this was driven into the riverbed using a sledgehammer a rubber bung was inserted into the top of the steel tube and the tubes withdrawn together the plastic tube insert was then removed cut to size and tube ends sealed with wax the success rate of coring was poor although five successful cores were obtained these involved careful selection of locations in areas of softer partially consolidated sediment with few cobbles as such representation of the entirety of sediment types in the tame was not achieved though later freeze coring reported in freitas et al 2015 did provide increased opportunity for inspection of in situ sediment heterogeneity and is exemplified later herein a total of 16 grab samples were taken from the river tame for batch sorption experiments during sediment characterisation and mapping of the riverbed deposits grab samples were obtained of a representative selection of hummock and armoured bedforms also supporting grab samples were obtained with depth in the vicinity of the core sites grab samples were excavated by spade from discrete depth intervals and bagged in containers as rapidly as possible to minimise loss in the flowing water column 3 2 tern rural catchment riverbed sampling seven riverbed cores two of which were used in the current study for kd determination were obtained from the river tern cores were taken from a reach close to that detailed by weatherill et al 2014 and characterised by low flow woody debris materials settled on soft predominantly sandy sediments an eijkelkamp beeker sampler for soft sediments was used to extract cores of sediment where possible for firmer sediments 1 m lengths of plastic tubing 5 cm diameter were driven into the sediment using a fence post driver and core withdrawn under suction by use of a rubber bung inserted at the tubing top around 90 recovery was achieved 3 3 laboratory methods 3 3 1 foc fraction of organic carbon content measurement the foc of sediment samples was measured using the solid sample module of a shimadzu total organic carbon analyser ssm 5000a infrared is used to measure co2 given off during sample combustion to determine sample carbon the solid sample module contains one furnace at 900 c to combust all carbon organic and inorganic and a second at 200 c to combust sample pre treated with phosphoric acid and determine the inorganic carbon fraction the organic carbon is determined by difference prior to analysis the sediments were oven dried for 24 h at 105 c and pulverized using a teema mill until they passed through a 250 μm sieve separate calibrations were performed for total and inorganic carbon tc and ic using respectively glucose 40 c over a range of 0 8 to 30 mg c and sodium carbonate 11 3 c over a range of 0 4 to 20 mg c samples of c 0 1 g were weighed into combustion boats and analysis done in triplicate for both total carbon and inorganic carbon 3 3 2 batch sorption experiments pce was used for batch sorption studies in preference to tce due to its greater hydrophobicity allowing easier measurement and due to the larger literature base e g allen king et al 1995 1998 ball and roberts 1991 rivett and allen king 2003 sediment samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and pulverised using a mortar and pestle until fine enough to pass a 250 μm sieve this reduces the time to reach equilibrium without influencing overall sorption magnitude ball and roberts 1991 sediments were then homogenised using a riffle splitter and divided for use in the batch experiments a series of 40 ml glass vials with ptfe silicone septa closures were filled with a known mass of sediment and synthetic groundwater designed to mimic typical ionic strength and cation proportions of the sandstone groundwaters in birmingham na 13 0 mg l ca2 72 9 mg l mg2 28 0 mg l cl 149 5 mg l so4 2 110 7 mg l vials were completely filled to prevent volatilisation losses and then spiked with a known mass of pce and left to equilibrate after equilibration pce concentrations remaining in the aqueous phase were measured and the amount of pce sorption calculated by difference care was taken to adjust the sediment water ratio so that predicted sorption based on foc would reduce the dissolved concentration by between 20 and 80 thus reducing the relative error in concentration measurements pce stock solutions were prepared by dilution in methanol with spikes below a mole fraction of 10 4 in the aqueous phase to avoid co solvency affects each individual experiment to determine sediment sorption at a given concentration was run as a set of three replicates with one set of vials containing sediment and synthetic groundwater and another two sets containing only synthetic groundwater one set of blank vials was analysed on the day of spiking to determine initial mass injected and the other was analysed along with the sorption vials at the end of the equilibration period 3 days to determine non sediment sorption mass loss day 1 blanks and calibration vials were placed on an orbital shaker table set at 450 motions minute 1 for 30 min before analysis day 3 blanks and sorption vials were placed on a shaker table shaking at 100 motions minute 1 for 3 days vials were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 30 min prior to extraction of the equilibrated aqueous phase pce concentration was determined by head space gc ms batch sorption tests were performed on 6 sediment samples taken from two cores from the rural tern site with each sample split to 3 sub samples to evaluate repeatability on 6 samples taken from two multilevel ml core sites on the urban tame with each sample split to 6 sub samples and 6 grab samples from two urban tame sites pebbly sand and hummock sediments again each sample split to 6 sub samples a single concentration spot wise sorption kd was determined on each sub sample from an initial spike dissolved phase concentration of c 800 µg l pce the value was selected to allow common comparison on samples and multiple sub samples at a moderately elevated concentration of regulatory concern within a discharging plume and was comparable to higher tce concentrations at the tame site an approach that is acknowledged to not permit investigation of sorption linearity proposed in future work pce diffusion into and through the vial septum was deemed the most significant non sorption mass loss that was quantified via the sediment free control vials spiked at c 8 80 and 800 μg l pce concentrations septum mass loss was calculated from the equilibrium rather than initial concentrations similar to allen king et al 1995 following their observation that equilibration of that loss occurs rapidly this loss was subtracted from the initial mass injected into the vial to calculate a new initial mass m 0 sorption was then calculated using allen king et al 1995 1 q m 0 c w v w m s where q is the sorbed concentration mm 1 cw is the aqueous equilibrium concentration vw is the volume of water and ms is the dry mass of solids it is acknowledged that assigning losses to diffusion into the septum may be disputed if sorption to substrates is very rapid and the main sink our sorption parameter estimation is hence regarded conservative but recognises a future work preference for glass ampoule based batch sorption measurements to avoid such uncertainties the sorption soil water partition coefficient kd l3m 1 was then determined using 2 k d q c w recognising sorption of hydrophobic contaminants occurs principally to organic matter distribution coefficients may be normalised by the laboratory measured fraction of organic carbon in the sediment foc to calculate the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient koc karickhoff et al 1979 3 k oc k d f oc for the river tame sediments kd was determined for the 6 grab samples taken from different locations across the river to represent the different sediment types pebbly sand and hummocks and another 6 samples taken with depth at two locations within a silty sandy area of the riverbed that was thought to be a potential location for enhanced na ml1 for the river tern kd samples were selected from different depths of two cores sub sectioned based on their lithology 3 3 3 petrographical characterisation of organic matter the om present in three shallow grab samples from the tame riverbed sediments was petrographically characterised the work was undertaken by a commercial specialist laboratory laop consulting and research tübingen germany laop and is based on methodologies described by jeong et al 2008 kiem et al 2003 and ligouis et al 2005 it is necessary for identifying condensed carbonaceous materials i e tacm for example yang et al 2008a b used similar techniques to investigate the transport of coal derived particle bound hydrophobic pahs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in floodplain soils quantitative microscopical analysis was conducted on polished mounts of organic concentrate produced from hcl and hf acid pre treatment of 90 g of non crushed riverbed sediment sample the analysis was undertaken with a leitz dmrx mpvsp microscope photometer in both reflected white light and uv plus violet light illumination fluorescence mode using an oil immersion objective of 50 magnification and a total magnification of 500 photographs were taken with a wild mps48 photoautomat using a 20 and a 50 oil immersion objective 50 total range of magnification 200 to 500 a scale bar of 20 µm or 50 µm is indicated within the images the analysis permits a quantitative measure of organic matter type with a broad division between nom in recent and ancient sediments and aom as defined earlier 4 results and discussion 4 1 urban study reach riverbed inspection fig 2 shows a map of the tame urban reach riverbed deposits along with sampling locations and relevant site photographs the riverbed predominantly comprises a well armoured cobbly and pebbly sand however from spring to autumn the growth of macrophytes can locally modify the bedform hummocks of fine sandy sediments and organic matter build up under trailing strands of macrophytes such as ranunculus due to the reduced water velocities described by cotton et al 2006 for a site elsewhere sand hummocks were observed up to several metres in length with thicknesses of up to 50 cm their upstream boundaries are curved fig 2 green areas but downstream areas are actively eroding with disconnected eddying often including entrained carbon rich particles the sand is usually grey or buff in colour contrasting with the more oxidised appearance of much of the pebbly sand between hummocks with a centimetre thick darker rim to the upper surface in contrast water flowing around the macrophyte patches is accelerated and flow channels are created where coarser sediments dominate found elsewhere by sand jensen and pedersen 1999 in addition to this increased spatial heterogeneity the seasonal nature of the macrophyte growth leads to a temporal heterogeneity in sediment structure and retention of organic matter even within seasons the sediment distribution can vary with hummocks eroding as well as forming fig 2 photograph bottom left our grab sediment sampling obtained a representative collection of the hummock sediment and the cobbly and pebbly sand because the cobbles were discarded after sampling the cobbly and pebbly sand samples will subsequently be termed the pebbly sand samples further grab riverbed sampling but with depth fig 2 was undertaken adjacent to the location of the ml3 ml6 and ml1 cores the samples obtained being used for determination of foc and kd some of the freeze cores later retrieved from the site freitas et al 2015 are shown in fig 2 and illustrate the significant heterogeneity of the riverbed deposits the cores display an array of poorly sorted deposits albeit with some layering obvious in places with grain size varying from fine silt to cobbles the observation of barbed wire in rusted degraded state at 30 cm below the current riverbed in freeze core fc2 demonstrates the relatively recent age of the deposits sampled for foc and kd determination our infrequent observations spanning around a decade have observed changes in the reach bedform locally due to accumulation of both natural and anthropogenic debris and flood scouring further indicating the dynamic nature of this urban riverbed environment 4 2 foc data table 1 summarises foc data obtained comprising a total of 5 cores and 16 grab samples for the urban tame site and 7 cores for the rural tern the data indicate means and ranges for the various sediment types that broadly accord with the relative expectation of foc contents for the sediment types sampled for example the pebbly sands of the tame and sands of the tern have low foc values often 1 whilst the hummock sediments under the tame macrophyte stands and the tern organic rich units have the highest values up to 21 for each sediment type the arithmetic mean and geometric mean foc are reasonably comparable the means of all river tern samples is somewhat misleading as the estimates are drawn from two contrasting populations i e low foc sands to which the geometric mean tends and high foc organic rich units to which the arithmetic mean tends the mean foc values for the various sediment types table 1 are generally within or approaching the range reported by clarke and wharton 2001 for other lowland english rivers 0 6 to 9 1 observed riverbed foc values are much larger than adjoining aquifer values the triassic sandstone that underlies both the tame and tern exhibits a typical range of 0 01 to 0 15 steventon barnes 2001 thornton et al 2000 shepherd et al 2002 the riverbed deposit foc values are hence 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater than the sandstones and confirm the general expectation given a preliminary assumption similar koc values apply of much greater retardation occurring in the riverbed sediments vertical profiles of tame riverbed indicate foc was quite elevated at 0 5 to 7 fig 3 the core profiles which cover a depth interval from 0 to 20 25 cm below the riverbed show some significant differences despite their relative proximity fig 2 ml6 has low foc throughout c 0 6 whilst both ml1 and ml3 exhibit higher values declining with depth from 4 to 2 and 6 5 to 1 5 respectively the shallowest 0 10 cm depth ml1 sample is described as soft brown grey fine grained sand and silt with visible organic matter particles present that are well degraded and dark brown black in colour as well as some woody debris this contrasts with the shallowest ml6 sample described as mainly pebbles 60 with medium coarse grained brown sand and gravel and no visible organic matter the 2 cm increment ml3 data illustrate the foc heterogeneity whilst not all high foc strata are always obvious visually the organic rich unit seen at 10 15 cm depth in the photo log of ml3 in fig 3 corresponds with the foc 7 peak this compares to the shallow pebbly sand grab samples table 1 with little obvious organic content that had foc values of 0 3 to 1 7 and arithmetic and geometric means of around 0 8 this sample material with cobbles removed represents the very shallow armoured pebble cobble deposit evident across much of the reach see fig 2 incl photograph samples of hummock sediment exhibited foc spanning the riverbed range 1 6 table 1 the field description of the 6 sample included visible well degraded consolidated organic matter as well as larger fragments of organic detritus the foc range accords with our observation of organic rich rims especially and less organic parts of the hummocks and also sand sized particles of coal like material deposited in the eddying downstream wakes of the hummocks the rural tern core samples used subsequently for laboratory determination of kd were from the mid to high range of foc values table 1 for core 1 7 15 19 and 6 and for core 2 15 and 16 with increasing depths these samples are organic rich units of what appear to be relatively recent depositional origin 4 3 pce batch sorption studies 4 3 1 kd and koc estimates results of the pce batch sorption studies are summarised in the fig 4 plot of experimentally observed sample kd values versus foc gradients representing the sediment koc eq 3 an approximately linear increase of kd with foc was observed for each sample type except ml6 that showed too little variation in foc to make a meaningful evaluation in this regard koc was greatest for sample ml1 at 7370 l kg corresponding to a fine grained sand and silt a softer sediment area below an overhanging tree partially protected from the main river flow fig 2 whilst the pebbly sand has a low foc compared to some of the high foc hummock sediments data for both display similar gradients in fig 3 with comparable koc calculated of 1530 l kg and 1950 l kg koc similarity suggests these sediments both from the shallow riverbed and certainly very recently deposited in the case of the hummock samples contain similar organic material fig 5 shows calculated koc values eq 3 plotted against foc for the urban tame and rural tern samples including sub sample open symbol and mean sample filled symbol estimates discussion below focuses upon the mean data but noting that sub sample variation is shown to be least for the ml1 and ml6 tame riverbed core with a standard deviation of 5 59 of the mean compared to 15 5 for the rural tern samples and 24 3 for the pebbly sand and hummock tame samples the fig 5 plot adopts a similar format to the second figure in wang et al 2013 including reference koc lines for the us epa 1996 geometric mean 265 l kg alongside empirical solubility and kow octanol water partition coefficient based estimates of koc these latter estimates are calculated using the approach of wang et al 2013 derived from linear solvation energy or hydrophobic partitioning theory schwarzenbach et al 2003 with the exception of some pebbly sand samples all of the tame riverbed sample koc mean estimates are at least double the us epa 1996 koc at over 500 l kg with most samples over 1000 l kg the koc values for the low foc content ml6 samples are elevated at c 2000 4000 l kg approaching the maximum study values of c 7000 l kg found for ml1 in contrast to the elevated urban sample koc values fig 5 shows a clustering of the rural river tern samples close to the us epa geometric mean tern data for cores 1 and 2 have sample based koc arithmetic and geometric means of 241 and 245 l kg respectively drawing on the discussion of wang et al 2013 the us epa geometric mean of 265 l kg is expected to be valid when applied to modern sediments that have quite high foc and or when high pce concentrations tending to solubility are present studies that contributed to the us epa value tended to accord with these criteria under these conditions absorption partitioning is dominant since any of the limited adsorption sites will have become saturated the us epa value compares well to the koc derived from both solubility and kow this consistency endorses the us epa value for sediments where absorption partitioning is dominant for pce it is concluded from the similarity of the tern sample koc estimates with the us epa koc estimates that absorption is predominant this is entirely reasonable based on of the fact that the rural tern samples are unlikely to contain significant quantities of tacm and are likely to be dominated by recent nom unlike the rural sediments most of the urban sediments have koc estimates well above the us epa mean fig 5 providing strong evidence of adsorption contributions our urban koc values are similar to the pce estimates of wang et al 2013 that show that the majority of tacm samples plot in the 1000 10 000 l kg koc range comparing to wang et al s figure 2a b plots of 5 and 5000 µg l pce data bracketing our concentrations we conclude our urban riverbed sediments exhibit significant and varying adsorption contributions that are highly likely to be attributable to the variable presence and or type of tacm due to the variability in the urban koc calculated arithmetic and geometric mean koc values for all the urban tame data of 2840 and 1770 l kg respectively somewhat differ fig 5 greater sample numbers are necessary to more fully comment on the statistical nature of the urban distribution 4 3 2 r estimates fig 6 plots calculated retardation factor r estimates for pce from the batch kd data as a function of sediment foc based on the standard relationship 4 r 1 ρ b k d η where ρ b is the dry bulk density of the sediment and η its porosity to which nominal representative values are respectively allocated of 1 855 kg l and 0 3 reference r lines are calculated for the sample arithmetic and geometric means of the tame and tern data and for the us epa geometric mean koc point kd mean and the trend line for the rural tern data lie very close to the us epa estimate fig 6 r ranges from 80 for the low foc 5 5 up to 400 for the maximum foc 19 the only tame sample close to the us epa trend line is a pebbly sand sample this yields the study minimum r of just 4 6 arising from its low foc 0 3 these r estimates relate to sediments where sorption appears to be dominated by absorption to recent nom the agreement supports that use of the us epa geometric mean koc combined with a measured tern riverbed foc should provide a reliable prediction of retardation occurring in these rural riverbed sediments the geometric mean for the full tern foc dataset generates an r estimate of 24 the arithmetic mean influenced by some elevated foc values realises an r of 71 and the maximum tern foc yields an r of 340 the variation is illustrative of the sensitivity of retardation to the magnitude and spatial variability of foc within the riverbed by way of comparison the triassic sandstone aquifer foc range reported earlier of 0 01 to 0 15 generates very low r estimates of 1 2 to 3 5 pce velocities through the rural tern riverbed sediments are hence 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those in the adjoining sandstone aquifer it is obvious from fig 6 that the us epa koc forms a very poor basis for the prediction of the observed r estimates for the urban samples it would generally lead to very significant underestimation of the urban sample r the seven samples that have foc in the range 0 3 to 0 9 are illustrative of the poor predictability of r from foc data using a single literature koc the us epa koc would predict r in the range 6 to 16 for these sediments yet actual r estimates from laboratory kd data range from 4 6 to 155 the arithmetic and geometric mean tame sediment r lines are around an order of magnitude above the us epa r estimate the greatest r values for the ml1 samples which had a moderate foc of 2 to 4 less than tern samples were estimated at 715 to 1620 for which the us epa trend line would have returned r values of 34 to 67 the underestimation of r when using the us epa koc values suggests a greater degree of sorption an observation consistent with the presence of tacm review of all the urban points in fig 6 is suggestive of a broadly increasing r with increasing foc emerging from lower values of foc and r being relatively close to us epa trendline this observation is the basis of using a simple mixing model to describe the relationship whereby sorption is assumed to occur to a mix of recent nom and tacm sorption to the nom proportion of the foc is characterised by assuming the us epa koc applies and to the remaining proportion of tacm of the foc that the koc observed to fit the maximum foc values applies a mixed kd may hence be calculated and substituted into eq 4 to calculate the trend in r with foc based upon 5 k d f oc n o m k oc n o m f oc t a c m k oc t a c m two mixing relationship lines are shown in fig 6 that encompass the urban samples a lower line approximately fits the hummock sediment samples and assumes foc nom is fixed at 0 7 point of departure from the us epa trend line and foc tacm fully accounts for the increased foc value above this point with the koc tacm assumed to be 1800 l kg and is close the tame geometric mean koc also plotted to which it approximately converges the higher mixing line that approximates the deeper riverbed more sorbing ml1 and ml6 sediment samples assumes a fixed foc nom of 0 4 and a koc tacm of 8000 l kg that provides an estimation of the koc applicable to the tacm whilst it is arguable as to the assigned foc proportions the foc nom may be underestimated the mixed line profiles do nevertheless provide a valid descriptor of the observed urban r variations fig 7 adopts a similar style to fig 6 but focuses on the ml3 dataset for which only foc and no kd data were obtained fig 3 various koc can be assigned to estimate a kd and r the figure shows trend lines for r and the individual ml3 data points that reflect the foc variability in the core based on i the us epa 1996 koc representing an absorption dominated sediment ii geometric mean urban tame koc and iii maximum urban tame koc within each of these estimates the arithmetic and geometric mean r estimates for the ml3 profile are highlighted the plot illustrates the vast range in r that may result for these different bounding koc assumptions it highlights not only the greater than an order of magnitude variation in r that may result from different selection of koc but also for a given koc that the range in r also approaches an order of magnitude due to the variability of foc cf fig 3 the absence of any ml3 kd data is a significant handicap to confidently predicting the riverbed deposit properties here the prudent choice would probably be the selection of the geometric mean tame urban koc retardation of the lesser chlorinated cahs often present at sites including the study site freitas et al 2015 will be reduced compared to pce due to their lower hydrophobicity and sorption potential as a first approximation indicative r or kd or koc estimates may be generated based on solubility scaling methods as used by rivett and allen king 2003 to account for their reduced hydrophobicity tce is around a factor of 5 and cdce cis dichloroethene and vc vinyl chloride around an order of magnitude more soluble than pce r estimates for the lesser chlorinated cahs may be anticipated to be reduced by around these factors as a crude first estimate relative sorption may also be made from studies examining sorption for several cah for example lu et al 2011 provide kd for the above cah on clayey tills that approximately scale with hydrophobicity commensurate with the above expectations noting their dataset foc 0 02 0 08 and pce kd 0 84 2 45 l kg are around the minima of data reported herein 4 4 organic petrography the three shallow grab samples from the tame riverbed sediments examined using organic petrographic techniques laop were obtained from deposits with the following characteristics a brown grey fine grained ml1 sand and silt with visible om fragments present such as leaves and woody debris less well degraded than found in the upper 10 cm sample ml1 10 15 cm a brown grey fine medium grained hummock sand and silt with visible well degraded consolidated om as well as larger fragments of organic detritus grab sample 5 a yellow brown pebbly sand from the armoured riverbed with no visible om grab sample 8 before organic petrographic examination any large clasts organic or otherwise were removed from the sample leaving the granular matrix this procedure avoided the possibility of for example a large woody fragment dominating any given sample table 2 summarises the much more detailed tabulation of data provided by laop the table subdivides to the general categories of recent nom and aom the latter includes significant tacm it may be construed arguable as to whether all items under aom are truly anthropogenic for example hard coal variously elevated in table 2 samples may potentially have some natural geogenic origin arising from river or run off erosion of near surface coal seams most seams will however be either protected by alluvial or glacial sediments within or near the tame or else mined long ago due to their shallowness and ease of access coal related om found in the riverbed has much more likely arisen from coal particle release associated with the recent centuries of intense mining operations spoil tip leaching and abandoned workings and rebounding mine water overflows as well as more general industrial urban anthropogenic activity although a rural catchment overlying coal measures may provide a more rigorous background comparator to assess relative influence of anthropogenic versus geogenic natural release of coal particles most if not all such catchments in the uk are highly urbanised and extensively mined table 2 confirms that the proportion of nom within the greater sediment om was small ranging from 5 2 to 14 7 with the majority being gelified or non gelified woody phytoclast material tissues structureless humic detritus the hummock sand sample is almost certainly negatively biased as larger om fragments described above were omitted and the sample largely reflects the macrophyte filtered riverine sediment all sediments are dominated by the aom comprising 85 95 of the om table 2 nearly all types of anthropogenic particles in laop s classification system were found to be present suggesting a diversity of om input to the tame the principal sources of the om particles found appear to be from coal mining or coal processing cokes residues and solids produced during coal hydrogenation processes hard coal accounts for 28 53 alongside high levels of residues of coal hydrogenation at 23 37 contribution to the former from natural erosion of coal is possible but likely very limited relative to the anthropogenic mediated contribution from the historic coal mining activity parker 2015 the residue percentages are probably an overestimate table 2 footnote as they also include soot from traffic and oil combustion which are likely to be present due to the high density of major and minor roads in the vicinity of the river there is some evidence of coal and petroleum derived fluorescent materials at 1 9 these will include tar oils and lubricants the greatest quantity being found in the pebbly sand i e the shallow armoured riverbed deposit a selection of petrographic images is shown for the hummock and pebbly sand samples in fig 8 and fig 9 see crelling and rimmer 2015 for relevant terminology these again are from a database of many images provided by laop and are selected to provide an illustration of the diversity of om types encountered but do not provide comprehensive coverage with the exception of the lower right images in both figures of nom examples the other images illustrate the diversity of the tacm dominated organic matter aom found the images cover various forms of coal coke char and soots added to these are several images of coal tar a viscous napl produced in the past at town gas or coal carbonisation works aka manufactured gas plants not infrequently located in the vicinity of rivers or canals and a key target of land remediation programmes in the past two decades the size of most anthropogenic particles observed is relatively large and is speculatively ascribed to potentially short transport distances from the sources most of the coal particles are described as very fresh with limited or no weathering the above observations are consistent with the catchment s mining related industrial past section 2 1 the organic petrography confirms the predominance of aom over nom in addition it demonstrates the significant occurrence of tacm essential to the argument of section 4 3 2 that the sorption properties observed are due to the presence of anthropogenic carbon the diversity of om shown by the images figs 8 and 9 in particular highlight that tacm based sorbents in the urban environment are heterogeneous with solid particulate and even liquid napl phases present of contrasting size surface area surface nature and anticipated microporosity of some tacm 5 illustrative modelling to explore implications 5 1 approach to investigate the implications of the modified description of riverbed sediment sorption some illustrative modelling has been undertaken using pce as the example contaminant the aims of the work were to investigate the residence time effect on na using our revised understanding of sorption behaviour in urban riverbed deposits for the modelled riverbed sections a common porosity and groundwater flux was specified dissolved phase pce solute was injected continuously the selected flow and transport parameters are given in table 3 these values are appropriate for saturated groundwater discharge from an underlying aquifer up into a river as encountered in the tame and the tern the values are based on data obtained for the study site freitas et al 2015 and the greater reach study by ellis and rivett 2007 the layered heterogeneity of kd is represented directly for the urban tame cores ml1 and ml6 based on the profile data presented in fig 3 a similar approach is taken for the rural tern core 1 with kd data for 4 discrete intervals the urban tame core ml3 foc results 13 discrete intervals fig 3 were used as a basis for illustrating the sensitivity of residence times to koc selection arithmetic average koc values from the tern core 1 269 l kg similar to the us epa 1996 geometric mean and from the tame 2844 l kg were used the conventional advection dispersion retardation degradation approach was used with a linear equilibrium isotherm r eq 4 biodegradation sensitivity was assessed through a range of nominal degradation rates half life 10 100 1000 d and no decay reflecting the site specific nature of biodegradation model runs were undertaken to evaluate bioavailability influence by assuming i biodegradation only occurred when in the dissolved phase i e the sorbed phase contaminant was not bioavailable and ii biodegradation occurred in both dissolved and sorbed phases case i was accomplished simply by scaling the aqueous half life by r case ii is recognised as probably not realistic but nevertheless permits simulation of a maximum degradation extreme scenario there are no exact solutions for the layered system even in 1 d and so either numerical modelling or semi analytical approaches are required a numerical modelling approach would be computationally intensive to ensure fully converged solutions we have instead used a laplace transform approach with numerical inversion of the solution to the resulting ordinary differential equation ode robinson and hodgkinson 1987 we have evaluated the solution at the end of the sediment core profile for selected times to construct the breakthrough curve the inversion is accomplished using talbot s 1979 method utilising his recommended contour shape parameters and ensuring convergence of the integration scheme by checking a 128 point integration scheme against the 64 point solution used each discrete section in the profile can be solved in laplace transform space simply as a second order ode with an exponentially growing and declining term we select the exponentially declining term which is suitable for the requirement that concentration would tend to zero at infinity in a semi infinite section the output flux from each layer is passed as the inlet flux to the subsequent layer and the output flux from the final layer converted back to a concentration this leads to an extremely efficient scheme for simulating layered heterogeneous one dimensional systems it does not allow for back dispersion between adjacent sections which is not unphysical for systems such as considered here where concentration gradients are always negative the approach is implemented in an excel spreadsheet tool using visual basic for applications vba for the function evaluations in s space and the numerical integration in the complex plane case 2014 5 2 simulations evaluating sorption influence upon residence times the contrast between urban tame and rural tern riverbed deposit pce sorption behaviour is illustrated in fig 10 all simulations adopt a half life of degradation of 10 d that is only active when the contaminant is present in the dissolved phase simulated profiles with symbol markers are for the riverbed core having laboratory kd based sorption parameter values these show earliest breakthrough for the urban tame ml6 core this is largely a consequence of the low foc of the profile out weighing the effects of its relatively high koc the next breakthrough is predicted to be for the rural tern core 1 which in contrast with the tame core has a high foc and a low koc though the breakthrough is delayed relative to the tame ml6 core the travel distance is around 50 longer and the pce velocities are similar the tern core contrasts with the tame core in having a high foc but low koc the most retarded breakthrough of the cases using the laboratory parameter values is for the tame ml1 core in this case breakthrough to c co 0 5 takes around 2300 d and to equilibrium breakthrough about 5000 d compared to around 500 d for the ml6 core both these profiles ultimately plateau around the same concentration which is a consequence of degradation just occurring in the dissolved phase where they spend similar times the significant retardation of the ml1 case is due to its very high koc and moderately high foc resulting in r values over 1000 fig 6 the pce breakthrough over this thin 19 cm riverbed deposit occurs over a period of 2 to 14 years from the arrival of the pce at the base of the deposit this is much greater than the groundwater travel time of 2 days it is quite probable that the ml1 deposits have a hydraulic conductivity up to at least an order of magnitude lower than modelled thus making the residence times even greater it is clear that pce residence within even thin 20 cm riverbed sediments may be measured in decades though this presumes that the sediment and solid phase om lifetimes are also at least similarly large the dashed curves lacking markers in fig 10 are for tame core ml3 which has a variable foc fig 3 the curves presented are for a range of koc values that might be used in practice the sensitivity to koc is seen to be significant in that the curves presented include breakthrough times both faster rural tern koc us epa koc and slower tame ml1 arithmetic mean koc than any of the systems so far discussed the simulations show clearly the significant error in residence times predicted when using the us epa 1996 koc inappropriately where tacm is a significant contributor to the foc 5 3 simulations evaluating bioavailability assumptions fig 11 illustrates the sensitivity to the bioavailability assumption using the ml3 core length 28 cm four of the curves lacking markers are for the low koc absorption dominant case with different decay constants the fifth is for decay in the aqueous phase only breakthrough is rapid for the no decay and aqueous only decay cases the latter rising nearly to input concentrations c co 1 despite a half life of only 10d it is clear that for the system studied decay occurring only in the aqueous phase is unlikely to affect attenuation significantly the other 3 curves lacking markers show however the significant influence of allowing contaminant decay of the sorbed pce even a long half life of 1000 d causes the equilibrium concentration to drop to 0 9c co a 100 d half life results in an equilibrium concentration of 0 4c co and no breakthrough i e complete attenuation is seen in the case of a 10d half life the latter result is in complete contrast to the 10 d half life case where decay occurs only in the aqueous phase and equilibrium relative concentrations were close to unity c co 0 98 the significance of the bioavailability assumption is hence clear the curves with markers in fig 11 are for the high koc adsorption dominant case and show delayed breakthrough in all cases due to the increased sorption rise to c co 1 for the no decay case now requires about 4000 d compared to 400 d for the low koc case the 10 d half life applied to just the aqueous phase results in only modest attenuation with a 0 8c co plateau the influence of allowing biodegradation of the sorbed phase causes even a very long half life of 1000 d to attenuate the breakthrough to a 0 4c co plateau a 100 d half life was required to achieve this equilibrium concentration for the low koc case a 100 d half life results in complete attenuation and no breakthrough hence as expected the significance of the bioavailability assumption is even more apparent in the more highly sorbing case the models illustrate quantitatively that even quite a long half life may result in complete attenuation of breakthrough if a sorbed phase has bioavailability but even very short half lives may have very limited effects if degradation occurs only in the aqueous phase without resolution of this assumption predictions could range from complete breakthrough to none at all 6 conclusions greater pce sorption and therefore increased residence time occurred in the study s urban riverbed deposits than in the study s rural riverbed deposits this was shown to be due to the presence of highly sorbing sediments containing organic matter rich in tacm of anthropogenic origin the evidence for this was obtained from pce batch sorption experiments and om characterisation of riverbed sediments from urban and rural sites the implications of the findings were quantitatively investigated by modelling which showed the contrast that may occur between urban and rural riverbed deposit residence times and also the substantial sensitivity to bioavailability assumptions sorption in the rural riverbed sediments is controlled by the presence of recent om to which absorption partitioning may occur this process is very well predicted using the us epa 1996 empirical koc e for pce whilst koc values are relatively low due to the presence of natural organic matter sorption in this lowland low velocity rural river is relatively high due to the sediment s high foc in contrast the urban riverbed sediments were found to exhibit much more variable but often significantly higher koc than the rural sediment and us epa koc values koc values in the urban deposits are typically around an order of magnitude or more greater than in the rural deposits and are similar to literature koc values for tacm where sorption is attributed to adsorption rather than absorption this presence of tacm was confirmed by organic petrography analysis that showed that the urban riverbed sediment om was dominated by a diversity of tacm materials with a high proportion of coal coke and coal hydrogenation residue this material can be attributed to river transport of particles released from extensive up catchment coal mining coal mining related industry e g coal gasification smelting and road discharges amongst other potential urban inputs it is concluded from the sorption data and modelling results that the presence of tacm in urban riverbed deposits may result in order of magnitude increases in pce residence times this would mean that years to a decade or more may be required for pce to breakthrough through even thin c 25 cm riverbed deposits where groundwater requires only days under the standard assumption that the sorbed contaminant is not bioavailable biodegardation in the dissolved phase occurs for such a limited proportion of time in highly sorbing sediments that attenuation of breakthrough is insignificant unless the half life is very low in such highly sorbing systems the assumptions on bioavailability become critical if biodegradation occurs in the sorbed phase even moderate to quite long half lives may cause complete attenuation of a discharging contaminant plume overall contaminant residence times within urban riverbed environments may be expected to vary greatly with significant sensitivity to sorption and biodegradation occurrence and bioavailability controls whilst the catchment is one of the most urbanised in the uk it is reasonably anticipated that many catchments around the world will be sufficiently urbanised that similar enhanced sorption of cah and other organic contaminants may be occurring due to the presence of tacm longer histories of anthropogenic activity perhaps dating back to the 18th century industrial revolution or prior may generate greater accumulated thicknesses of tacm within a riverbed the anthropocene period may hence be expected to have a considerable influence upon modern day contaminant residence time and fate within an urban riverbed sediments impacted by urban pollution or activities that have a significant presence of tacm cannot be assumed to have the property values usually assigned to other quaternary sediments a yet further consequence of contaminant accumulation in high sorption potential sediments is that sudden release of this stored pollutant may occur with sediment re suspension during flood events resulting in particle facilitated contaminant transport and possible significant influence upon river water quality schwientek et al 2013 rügner et al 2013 2019 future research is needed to determine how tacm amounts can be estimated in a practicable way in riverbed deposits to delineate the spatial distribution and depth in the riverbed of the elevated tacm high sorption layer and its dynamic movement during flood events and to establish the bioavailability of contaminants sorbed to both nom and tacm related system complexities also require assessment including non linearity of sorption with concentration and sorptive partitioning interactions with bacterial cell compartments and or exopolymeric substances of varying hydrophobicity leitner et al 2018 renpenning et al 2015 whilst tacm is relatively recalcitrant and not expected to act as an electron donor in cah biodegradation it can clearly cause significant increases in contaminant residence times it is hence necessary to establish if prolonged residence times coupled with supply of labile dom electron donors from surface water penetration of the sediments freitas et al 2015 alongside some labile nom already present in the sediments is sufficient to result in biodegradation of adsorbed and or absorbed contaminants

lengths these model versions are then compared to a detailed hec ras model set up with 620 locally surveyed cross sections in the itajaí açu basin in brazil all models are run with calibrated rainfall runoff parameters so that effects of non calibrated runoff fields or uncertain forcing data are not taken into consideration to assist interpretation three main requirements to define estimates from a river hydrodynamic model as locally relevant are defined the model errors should be equal or smaller i than the accuracy requirement for a particular application and location ii than typical local reach scale models errors and iii than observation uncertainties results then indicate that the regional and local mgb versions and to a lesser extent the global one could estimate locally relevant discharges and water level anomalies for many parts of the basin for absolute water levels all models failed to provide rmse smaller than 0 4 m basin wide although the local mgb model yields an average 2 1 m rmse in comparison to 4 4 m regional and 26 1 m global for flood extent all model versions generally yielded unsatisfactory results with average fit metric values smaller than 65 lastly different setups of the regional mgb model were run to investigate the role of different factors in improving model estimates results showed that a coarse reach length 15 km is unable to capture flood dynamics and water level variations in the basin while a smaller 1 km long reach improves discharges water level and flood extent a locally derived dem did not lead to significant improvements in relation to a global dem in turn the smallest water level errors would be attained by using information from the in situ cross sections in the regional models this study s outcomes are encouraging for the future development of regional to global hydrodynamic models with new remote sensing techniques and higher computational power improving cross section estimation and model discretization keywords

role in national to basin scale water resources management on the other hand local hydrodynamic models have a much higher degree of customization since their applications e g development of detailed

resolution and high accuracy data sets are available for river reaches under flood risk grimaldi et al 2018 providing more locally relevant estimates a cross scale comparison is therefore needed the recent developments of regional to global hydrodynamic models mentioned above naturally invoke the question on whether and to which extent those models can approach local detailed hydrodynamic models and what is the appropriate model complexity altenau et al 2017 to which extent can we use regional to continental models to map and estimate local flood hazard to which degree can we trust discharge and water level estimates from coarse resolution models while the effects of errors in input data and parameterization on hydrodynamic models outputs have been somehow studied in recent literature for both local and regional and for 1d and 2d models altenau et al 2017 cook and merwade 2009 dimitriadis et al 2016 fewtrell et al 2011 hoch et al 2017 horritt and bates 2002 jung and merwade 2015 liu

global regional local are still not understood this comprehension is fundamental for the development and understanding of current regional to continental and global models may mateo et al 2017 de paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2013 so that they ultimately move toward more locally relevant hydrodynamic estimates de moel et al 2015 in this context this paper presents to the knowledge of the authors a first cross scale comparison between global regional and local 1d hydrodynamic modeling strategies a local hec ras model application usace 2010 set up with 850 km of simulated river reaches and over 600 in situ cross sections is compared with different local regional and global applications based on the large scale mgb model pontes et al 2017 multiple tests are performed to address different levels of customization in hydrodynamic modeling varying cross section shape floodplain topography and length computations 2 methods 2 1 methodology overview and experimental design this study is divided in two main parts i a cross scale hydrodynamic model intercomparison and ii an analysis of the drivers of the differences in model performance in the first part three different model configurations are set up based on the mgb hydrologic hydrodynamic model with increasing scale modeling approaches called henceforth global regional and local mgb models these three configurations are compared to a locally based hec ras hydrodynamic model for the itajaí açu river basin in southern brazil for which there was availability of 620 in situ surveyed cross sections and a locally developed digital elevation model dem the goal of this part is to assess how locally relevant are the different model configurations considering the locally developed hec ras model as a reference benchmark as assumed in many practical hydraulic engineering studies the compared hydrodynamic models are forced with the same calibrated rainfall runoff parameters so that uncertainties related to hydrological inputs e g simulated runoff fields were not considered the three mgb model configurations are based on typically adopted approaches for the respective scales as summarized by table 1 three main factors were defined to differ hydrodynamic modeling approaches at the different scales i spatial discretization given by river reach length ii adopted dem to estimate floodplain topography and channel bank elevations and iii cross section geometry reach length refers to the equal distance segments in which the drainage network is divided and ultimately affects the length and number of computational units in the simulated domain and the estimated bank elevation which is computed from the average pixel elevations above the reach see siqueira et al 2018 supplementary material for description of the method the adopted dem is used to define floodplain topography and the reach bank elevation in turn the mgb cross section geometry is set as a rectangular cross section as typically adopted in regional to global models and thus channel bankfull depth and width values are required as model parameters the global model version uses a global database of cross section geometry andreadis et al 2013 srtm dem at 500 m spatial resolution and a reach length of 15 km this is analogous to the mgb continental application by siqueira et al 2018 the regional model adopts a basin scale derived geomorphic relationship between cross section bankfull width and depth and drainage area 30 m srtm dem and a reach length of 5 km finally in the local model the 620 cross sections parameters estimated bankfull width bankfull depth and bank elevation are directly inserted into the respective model reaches where they are located while for those reaches without surveyed cross sections the basin scale geomorphic relationship is used a locally developed dem hereforth called sds see dem description in 2 3 datasets section at 30 m is used together with 1 km long reaches the hec ras model was defined as the local truth and was developed by directly including the 620 cross sections within the model domain which covered the most important river reaches across the itajaí açu basin the second part of the study aims at understanding which factors drive the differences found among the three models configurations then the regional mgb model is set as a reference and different configurations are evaluated alone by varying reach length dem and cross section geometry for all tests the different mgb model configurations were run with the same rainfall runoff model parameters and the hec ras model was forced with mgb model discharges derived from the regional model version the models were run for the extreme 1983 flood in the itajaí açu river basin and the predicted discharge water level water level anomaly and flood extent were analyzed 2 2 study area the itajaí açu river basin in southern brazil fig 1 was used as a case study due to its contrasting floodplain geomorphology types and its size being of a suitable spatial scale for regional scale evaluation drainage area of 15 000 km2 and with a large range of slopes and channel width and depths fig 3 a large number of surveyed river cross sections are available together with a locally developed high quality dem the itajaí açu river is formed by three main tributaries the itajaí do oeste itajaí do norte and itajaí do sul rivers there are relevant floodplains throughout the whole basin varying from laterally constrained floodplains with terraces crops as rice to non constrained ones in its most downstream reaches in some reaches river rapids and waterfalls occur and define local hydraulic controls downstream of reaches with river floodplain interactions such as downstream of rio do sul city fig 1a the basin has a long history of damaging floods and today 1 5 million people live within it with most cities located around river floodplains during the extreme 1983 flood which is used for simulations in this study over 90 cities were affected throughout the basin and around 200 000 people were displaced leading to an estimated impairment of r 1 1 billion brazilian currency ceped ufsc 2015 frank 2003 to cope with such disasters three large flood control dams are located in the river three main tributaries recent flood events have also pushed new efforts to improve basin wide flood control including the proposal of new levees and flood control dams making the basin a relevant case study for improving our comprehension of hydrodynamic modeling estimates 2 3 datasets three different dem s were used for the global regional and local mgb model configurations and the hec ras setup table 1 the global and regional ones use the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem farr et al 2007 available at http srtm csi cgiar org at 500 m and 30 m spatial resolutions respectively the local mgb and hec ras models used a dem sds dem developed for the whole santa catarina state in brazil by the states s secretary of sustainable economic development sds 2013 available at http sigsc sds sc gov br the dem has a 1 m spatial resolution and an estimated vertical accuracy of 0 39 m to allow data management it was upscaled to 10 m for hec ras and to 30 m for the mgb local model version to be comparable with srtm spatial resolution all dem s were converted to brazilian sirgas2000 mapgeo2015 geoid model ibge 2015 because sds dem and in situ cross sections were referenced to it differences between mapgeo2015 and egm96 srtm s datum data in the region ranged from around 0 6 to 0 6 m fig 2 presents hand height above nearest drainage rennó et al 2008 terrain maps derived from the srtm 500 m srtm 30 m and sds 30 m for the locations of rio do sul and itajaí cities see fig 1 for location these maps highlight the extensive floodplains occurring along these areas as well as the large differences between the dem s it is noticeable the better description of terrain elements such as roads and urban areas in the sds dem in comparison to srtm 30 m which features a pronounced speckle noise a total of 620 locally surveyed river cross sections were used which are displayed in fig 1b a post processing was performed to complement all sections that did not cover the full lateral extent of the river floodplains with the sds dem at 10 m spatial resolution channel bankfull width and depth values were required for the mgb runs which adopts a rectangular cross section for simulation for the global model configuration the global database developed by andreadis et al 2013 was used fig 3 which was based on regressions between these variables and average annual discharge the regional model used a basin scale i e regional regression between these variables and drainage area based on the 620 locally surveyed cross sections and by adjusting a rectangular cross section to each section i e bankfull depth estimated by dividing wetted area by bankfull width examples of the adjusted rectangular cross sections are presented in fig 4 finally the local model used average cross sections values for the model river reaches where the sections were located while for the basin areas without cross sections the regional regression was adopted fig 3 presents the estimates with 95 confidence intervals for global and basin scale regressions which show that the global estimates include the local based ones within the 95 interval for bankfull width but underestimate bankfull depth values 2 4 mgb hydrologic hydrodynamic model the mgb model collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 is a semi distributed hydrologic hydrodynamic model developed for large scale basins the basin is divided into unit catchments that are further split into hydrologic response units hru s for which vertical hydrological processes are computed evapotranspiration soil infiltration and surface subsurface and groundwater flow generation runoff generated within each unit catchment is routed along the drainage network with the local inertial approximation of saint venant equations proposed by bates et al 2010 in this section the hydrodynamic module is focused and the reader is referred to pontes et al 2017 and siqueira et al 2018 for a more detailed explanation of rainfall runoff model conceptualization and parameters in the current version of the model siqueira et al 2018 supp material unit catchments are defined as the local drainage area of river segments for this the drainage network is segmented into constant length reaches which varied from 1 km to 15 km in the performed tests then for the model configurations based on the 30 m spatial resolution dem s the 1 km based model led to 4444 unit catchments while the 5 km 15 km one had 1118 614 units for the 500 m dem model run the drainage network slightly differed from the 30 m one so that the number of unit catchments changed to 573 for 5 km and 945 for 15 km long reaches one rectangular cross section is defined for each unit catchment reach with bank elevation channel bankfull width and depth and manning s coefficient as main parameters hydraulic geometry theory leopold and maddock 1953 is used to estimate bankfull width and depth based on simple geomorphic relationships e g by relating these values to local drainage area in this study this strategy was adopted by using different relationships of cross section geometry with drainage area based on global or regional estimates see section 2 3 datasets for details for each unit catchment average bankfull elevation was estimated from a linear regression of all dem pixels above the unit catchment river pixels floodplain topography i e level area relationships for each unit catchment was extracted with a hand rennó et al 2008 based algorithm these pre processing steps are described in siqueira et al 2018 supplementary material the explicit inertial numerical scheme bates et al 2010 is run at a time step defined by courant friedrichs lewy condition with a stability alpha parameter set to 0 2 in this application downstream boundary condition in the basin outlet to atlantic ocean was set as a zero elevation to be consistent with the hec ras application mgb model rainfall runoff parameters were adjusted with observed discharges and are not presented here for brevity for the tests performed in this study the july 1983 flood event was selected due to its extreme nature and the simulated discharges at hourly time step during the event simulation period from 1st june 1982 to 1st august 1983 to include spin up period were used to force the hec ras model 2 5 detailed hydraulic model the 1d hec ras hydrodynamic model usace 2010 outputs were adopted as a proxy of locally relevant variables due to the software s widespread use in hydraulic engineering applications the software solves the full saint venant equations with a preissmann four point implicit scheme a model application including 620 in situ surveyed cross sections was set up covering 863 km of river reaches in the itajaí açu river basin and including all the main basin tributaries fig 1b a post processing was performed to complement the sections to the whole floodplain area with the sds 10 m for those sections that did not cover the whole floodplain in river reaches with low cross section density the sections were linearly interpolated to improve numerical representation fig 4 presents three cross sections located in different parts of the itajaí açu mainstem as an example the adjusted rectangular cross sections used to derive the regional scale geomorphic relationship are also displayed as boundary conditions hec ras was forced with mgb regional model simulated discharges as contributing upstream hydrographs for upstream sections as contributing lateral inflow for the tributaries not represented in hec ras and as local runoff generated for the mgb unit catchments located within each cross section at the downstream boundary condition sea level was adopted at elevation zero manning s roughness coefficient was set as 0 035 for channel and 0 1 for floodplains basin wide following general river hydrodynamic applications chow 1959 usace 2016 2 6 performance metrics four main hydrodynamic variables were evaluated in this study discharge water level i e absolute water level water level anomaly i e hourly level subtracted from long term average level and maximum flood extent for the first three ones the global regional and local mgb model versions were compared to hec ras at each river cross section with the metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse it ranges from to 1 where 1 is the optimum value for discharge and root mean square error rmse it ranges from 0 to where 0 is the optimum value for water levels the 620 cross sections enabled then a basin scale comparison of the models different runs of the regional model are performed in section 3 2 by changing reach length dem and cross sections to evaluate the difference between mean values and to create a performance ranking for each factor a paired student s t test was performed between each pair of boxplots at a 95 significance level following the method for two samples with different variances described by naghettini 2017 maximum flood extent was evaluated with the fit metric f bates and de roo 2000 sometimes referred to as critical success index eq 1 1 f 100 a b a b where a and b are the observed i e hec ras and simulated i e mgb global regional and local model configurations flood extents for a given area f ranges from 0 to 100 where 100 is the optimum value the metric was computed for each unit catchment with maximum flood fraction higher than 10 in the hec ras simulation located within two main floodable areas rio do sul and itajaí city locations fig 1b in order to compare models with different spatial resolution global 500 m regional and local 30 m hec ras 10 m all flood maps were resampled to 10 m with a nearest neighbor algorithm 3 results 3 1 cross scale comparison simulated maximum water level longitudinal profiles for two rivers itajaí açu mainstem and trombudo see fig 1 for location with high cross section density are presented in fig 5 results are displayed for hec ras and the global regional and local mgb model configurations the global one is very limited to estimate absolute water level in comparison to the regional and local ones its coarse resolution 15 km is also evident in contrast to 5 km 1 km for regional local models a detail with a zoom in the itajaí açu middle reaches 60 120 km is also provided and further stresses the differences between the local with local insertion of cross sections and regional models and the closer results between local and hec ras estimates fig 6 shows discharge water level and water level anomaly time series at rio do sul indaial and blumenau cities along itajaí açu mainstem see fig 1 for location peak discharge delay and reduction by the global model are associated with exaggerated floodplain attenuation while local and regional ones are much closer to hec ras for example peak discharge differences are 2 and 12 for local and global models for rio do sul and 3 and 20 for blumenau locations the global setup overestimates absolute water level in the three locations indicating that its coarse resolution and reach length may hamper its use for precise local water level estimation it is interesting to note how satisfactory were the regional and local simulations in rio do sul especially considering the rapids and hydraulic controls existent downstream of it which are represented in hec ras but not in mgb on the other hand in terms of water level anomaly in indaial all models are relatively satisfactory while in rio do sul and blumenau the amplitude is smaller in the global model due to excessive floodplain the performance for discharge nse metric water level rmse and water level anomaly rmse variables is summarized in the boxplots of fig 7 which plot for each model configuration the performance of all 620 cross sections average and standard deviation including all outliers values of the metrics are displayed below each model name the local model outperforms the regional one only on the absolute water level estimates while the differences to global estimates are significantly high and suggest that the latter s water levels are unsatisfactory for local scale usage as observed in fig 6 with water level time series for this variable the local model also leads to less dispersion on its estimates for discharge and water level anomaly estimation both regional and local models provide similar results boxplots related to flood extent f metric are presented in fig 7 for all unit catchments and separately for itajaí and rio do sul locations which present different floodplain geomorphologies in rio do sul the floodplain features a highly constrained lateral extent following the description by hunter et al 2007 which could be understood as similar to a two stage compound channel in turn the lower itajaí açu around itajaí city has a more unconstrained lateral extent where a binary flood extent map would be more difficult to estimate all model versions have similar performance in itajaí with f averages between 36 and 43 while the local mgb outperforms the others in rio do sul with 52 against 39 and 34 f values the regional model has a larger interquartile range than the others in both areas to further understand the spatial differences between the models the performance of discharge water level and water level anomaly variables for each cross section is presented in the fig 8 maps the colors represent different performance classes ranging from blue satisfactory to red unsatisfactory and allows interpretation of where each model could provide a locally relevant estimate which are defined here as a class with discharge nse 0 9 or water level rmse 0 4 m see discussion in section 4 1 firstly it is clear that the global model performs poorly for both discharge and water level variables while for water level anomaly the three model configurations are reasonable major areas of poor global discharge estimation are the upstream headwaters and the lower itajaí açu which are coincident with steep reaches and areas subjected to major flooding respectively also most cross sections present discharge nse 0 9 and water level anomaly rmse 0 4 m for regional and local models indicating that for these two variables there would be a satisfactory confidence in the predictions in many points only a few isolated locations present discharge estimates with nse 0 6 red points in many cases due to bifurcation channels which were represented in the hec ras model in turn for absolute water level only in a few isolated cross sections does the local model perform well rmse 0 4 m stressing its general difficulty of accurately estimating levels along the itajaí açu mainstem reaches at chainage 100 150 km see water level longitudinal profile in fig 5 present the worst absolute water level estimations red to orange cross sections what can be explained by the steep channels that occur in this part in the lower itajaí açu near its mouth i e reaches subjected to backwater effects by the downstream boundary condition the model provided satisfactory estimates of water level anomaly rmse 0 4 m and relatively good absolute water level rmse 1 m maximum flood extent maps are presented in fig 9 for the locations of rio do sul and itajaí cities fig 1b f values are presented for the whole area extent and represent how accurate are the mgb runs in comparison to hec ras for rio do sul the local mgb model f 45 performed better than both regional f 35 and global f 26 ones in accordance with fig 7 boxplots in itajaí city all model versions had similar performance ranging from 38 regional to 42 global and 44 local flooded areas in itajaí were also much larger than rio do sul ones the relatively low values 50 suggest a difficulty in all mgb model configurations to estimate this variable what could be improved by calibrating channel depth for example the next section will address the relative effects of cross section geometry dem and reach length on these results 3 2 on the drivers of cross scale differences in order to understand the differences between global regional and local model runs from the previous section 3 1 here a set of simulations is performed by considering the regional mgb model as a reference and by changing its main components i e reach length dem and cross section geometry fig 10 summarizes the results for discharge water level absolute and anomaly and flood extent by presenting boxplots for each model configuration considering the mgb model performance in relation to hec ras simulations for the ensembles of cross sections discharge and water level and unit catchments flood extent itajaí and rio do sul regions are plotted together in this analysis in contrast to the previous 3 1 section discharge results indicate a model improvement by using 1 km long reaches in comparison to 5 and 15 km while for dem and cross sections the regional and local configurations are similar i e srtm 30 and sds 30 and regional and local geometries respectively and perform better than the global one differences between srtm and sds at 30 m do not seem to be relevant in terms of stored volume in the river floodplains system even considering the higher speckle noise in srtm hand maps in fig 2 in the global application both dem srtm 500 m and global geometry with smaller bankfull depths led to higher flooding and thus discharge underestimation and smaller nse for water level the 1 km long reach and the local geometry configurations i e the local approaches improved model estimates while regional dem srtm 30 m performed better than the local one sds 30 m the 15 km length seems to be inadequate to represent the flood dynamics in the itajaí açu river basin especially if considered some steep reaches with relevant changes in river bed elevation moving from 15 km to 5 km lengths water level rmse would be improved from 15 8 m to 4 4 m the smallest water level rmse 2 7 m would be obtained by improving regional model cross sections towards more local estimates the behavior of water level anomaly was different from the other variables since all evaluated model configurations showed a similar performance for this variable the global modelling approach performed worse than the regional and local ones only when analyzing cross section geometry local geometry led to significantly smaller water level anomaly average rmse than the regional one although the values were relatively similar 0 8 and 0 7 m flood extent boxplots indicate that the 1 km reach would lead to better average f values 51 37 and 26 while both srtm 30 m 37 and sds 30 m 34 dem s would outperform srtm 500 m 24 the global based cross section geometry obtained the best performance 68 in comparison to regional 27 and local 40 estimates although this result may be somehow surprising it may be explained by the relatively smaller global bankfull depths if compared to local ones fig 3 what led to much more flooding and a better f metric however as observed in fig 6 the global model tends to exaggerate discharge attenuation with too much flooding basin wide global model flood extent extended to the whole floodplain domain i e behaving as a laterally constrained floodplain and water depth maps not presented here for brevity showed that floodplain depths were indeed higher in the global model than hec ras estimates this indicates that the optimum flooding estimation would be attained by adopting an intermediate bankfull depth value i e between local and global estimates in such laterally constrained floodplains flood extent may not be a suitable metric to be evaluated in such cases hunter et al 2007 4 discussion 4 1 on the definition of locally relevant estimates in the context of regional global hydrodynamic models regional to global hydrodynamic models are now a reality and have been proven to yield better estimates than non hydrodynamic ones for variables as discharge water surface elevation and flood extent in many locations siqueira et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 although global models should be used for the purposes they were designed for de moel et al 2015 ward et al 2018 it is a major and open question whether their estimates could be deemed as locally relevant or to which scale could they be trusted the goal of attaining locally relevant estimates everywhere with global models have been recently discussed in the literature bierkens 2015 bierkens et al 2015 döll et al 2016 pau et al 2016 wada 2016 however a precise definition of what a locally relevant variable is and how it could be used as a measure of model performance is not yet available the variable of interest itself depends on the model application e g in flood related studies water depths are more relevant for evaluating damage to buildings while velocity are interesting for bridges and time and duration of flooding for agricultural crops de moel et al 2015 three main requirements for attaining locally relevant estimates in the context of river hydrodynamic models are then proposed table 2 the errors of a regional to global model should be equal or smaller i than the accuracy requirement for a particular application and location ii than typical local reach scale models errors and iii than observation uncertainties even more if there is no information available for a particular location e g absence of in situ data or local models a global model will naturally be locally relevant although it may present large yet possibly unknown errors the first is more subjective and depends on the local landscape e g channel slope floodplain geomorphology and river water level amplitude and social factors e g floodplain occupation and local water agencies stakeholders community perception of the river system pappenberger et al 2007 and thus it is not straightforward to define a general threshold of locally relevance for flood forecasting very short term forecasts e g within hours may require high accuracy estimates at the centimeter scale while longer leading times e g a few days may accept errors at the meter scale since each forecast will have a different role in the disaster management if deterministic thresholds are adopted e g warning alert flood level todini 2018 these may be used to define the required accuracy in flood damage estimation e g for flood insurance companies or flood risk estimation by governmental agencies sensitivity of damage to different water levels in level damage relationships could be used to define thresholds above which errors are not acceptable the expected accuracy should also take into consideration that higher uncertainties may exist to define exposure and vulnerability than hazard itself apel et al 2009 jongman et al 2012 schröter et al 2014 in the case of river structures such as reservoirs and levees acceptable estimation errors tend to be small i e few centimeters in the united states for example levees are only allowed to be constructed if a local water level increase smaller than 30 5 cm 1 feet is estimated for a 100 year flood heine and pinter 2012 in turn for studies related to water quality and biogeochemical cycles carbon nitrogen phosphorus it is understood that important retention occurs in very small water bodies as lakes reservoirs and wetlands bouwman et al 2013 so that this small scale features should be well represented in hydrodynamic models the same occurs when analyzing sediments with relevant small scale processes such as sediment trapping river bank erosion and bed load transport bierkens et al 2015 for water quality and sediments small bias 10 and a satisfactory dynamics e g by adopting correlation coefficient values 0 8 of discharge velocity and residence time should be pursued for climatic and environmental impacts studies the models should attain errors smaller than the magnitude of changes e g smaller than the estimated increase in discharge under climate change for studies focusing on comprehension of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes fleischmann et al 2018 de paiva et al 2013 models should have errors smaller than the physical signals e g smaller than water level amplitude along a floodplain if analyzing this variable the second requirement is related to the capacity of locally developed hydrodynamic models i e state of the art models as 1d or 2d hec ras set up with detailed cross sections in representing local features this would be the maximum attainable performance for global models studies in the literature suggest that reach scale models obtain water level errors rmse typically between 0 1 and 0 4 m adams et al 2018 altenau et al 2017 apel et al 2009 bermúdez et al 2017 fewtrell et al 2011 matgen et al 2007 rudorff et al 2014 what may differ if the assessed rmse metric refers to at a station water level series water depth level maps or longitudinal level profiles for flood extent the f fit metric has typical values above 65 altenau et al 2017 horritt and bates 2002 tayefi et al 2007 depending on the floodplain geomorphology hunter et al 2007 the assessment of simulated discharge performance depends on the goal of the study minimum mean maximum flows but using the commonly adopted nash sutcliffe metric one could argue that a 0 9 value could be a locally relevant threshold bermúdez et al 2017 moriasi et al 2015 suggest a very good nse above 0 8 lastly global regional model errors should be at the same magnitude of observation uncertainties since it is not possible to reduce model errors for values below observation errors i e models should be accepted within a range of observation uncertainty mcmillan et al 2018 schumann et al 2008 it is typically accepted that water level observation errors are much smaller than discharge ones typically less than a few centimeters di baldassarre and montanari 2009 todini 2018 in turn discharge observation errors depend on the employed method velocity area methods may have 8 20 errors in relation to the discharge value pelletier 1988 or errors below 5 with adcp measurements herschy 2014 high uncertainty estimated at 6 2 42 8 by di baldassarre and montanari 2009 occurs when using rating curves to estimate discharge from observed water level especially when high flow extrapolation is performed di baldassarre and montanari 2009 domeneghetti et al 2012 dottori et al 2009 in turn flood extent mapping is subjected to errors associated with image processing and classification methods the physical principle itself e g optical passive and active microwave sensors and the image spatial temporal resolution schumann et al 2009 and the necessity of including the uncertainty of binary flood maps in model calibration validation e g through a fuzzy membership approach for image classification pappenberger et al 2006 has been discussed in the literature horritt 2006 pappenberger et al 2007 2006 schumann et al 2009 2008 classification accuracies usually defined as the percentage of total area with omission errors rarely exceed 90 for synthetic aperture radar sar datasets schumann and moller 2015 hess et al 2003 reported for a classification of jers sar images in the amazon basin accuracies higher than 90 for open water but between 56 and 87 for vegetated flooded areas and clement et al 2018 presented a sar classification technique validated for floods in yorkshire uk with an accuracy higher than 71 5 from the above discussion it is rather complicate to define a threshold for locally relevant estimates being an open and interesting discussion in the scientific community however it is proposed here that water level rmse values above 0 4 m discharge nse above 0 9 and f values above 65 may be suitable thresholds to evaluate global regional models especially for flood studies 4 2 how locally relevant are the regional to global hydrodynamic model estimates assuming the hec ras model as a reference benchmark it was compared to the global regional and local mgb versions in order to understand to which degree can these models estimates be trusted since calibrated rainfall runoff parameters were adopted and not global or regional runoff fields which are typically not calibrated and present important biases siqueira et al 2018 results point to the maximum potentiality of the current hydrodynamic models the global mgb model has limitations in accurately estimating discharge and water levels absolute values and anomalies due to the coarse dem srtm 500 m the adopted reach length 15 km and the cross section with relatively small bankfull depth values from the global database these factors had different effects on each variable water level anomaly was mainly improved with better cross sections locally relevant estimates nse 0 9 rmse 0 4 m and f 65 could only be attained with the global approach for water level anomalies in certain sections along the basin while this was not the case for discharge absolute water level and flood extent on the other hand its performance was relatively satisfactory for discharges and water level anomalies from a global model perspective i e for global assessment of water fluxes with nse 0 6 for most cross sections along itajaí açu mainstem peak discharge differences between local and global models and hec ras ranged from 2 to 12 in rio do sul and 3 20 in blumenau location what may be deemed satisfactory if compared to 5 40 uncertainties in observed discharges and rating curves di baldassarre and montanari 2009 domeneghetti et al 2012 dottori et al 2009 pelletier 1988 moving towards regional modeling approaches i e higher resolution dem regionally derived cross section parameters and finer resolution computation units and reach lengths results outperformed the global model for most analyzed variables although only discharge could be deemed as locally relevant basin wide with the regional model nse 0 9 in turn the local mgb model satisfactorily represented the water longitudinal profile or water slope in the analyzed itajaí açu and trombudo rivers fig 5 which is an interesting signature of river hydrodynamics garambois et al 2017 but it also could not lead to estimates with local relevance rmse of 2 1 m smaller than the proposed threshold of 0 4 m none of the mgb model versions yielded locally relevant estimates of flood extent improving reach lengths to 1 km led to the best f values of 51 on average despite the global cross section scenario which led to exaggerated water depths and flooding but a satisfactory yet meaningless f that may indicate the necessity of better representing local hydrodynamic features moving towards 2d modeling may also be relevant altenau et al 2017 comparisons between global hazard models estimates with locally developed hazard maps reported f values between 45 and 65 for european rivers alfieri et al 2013 59 65 for canadian rivers smith et al 2015 50 55 for united states nationwide fema flood hazard maps wing et al 2017 and 51 90 for selected high quality united states usgs flood hazard maps wing et al 2017 a reach length of 15 km yields poor results of water level profile in the itajaí açu basin global hydrodynamic models use reach lengths even higher than this value yamazaki et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 while large lengths could increase numerical instabilities or numerical diffusion their decrease would lead to much more computational units what may be soon feasible under increasing computation power an interesting conclusion of this study is that the dem source sds 0 39 m vertical accuracy and srtm 6 2 m at 90 m resolution rodríguez et al 2006 was less important than dem spatial resolution 30 m and 500 m and reach length especially for larger reach lengths as 15 km speckhann et al 2018 obtained similar conclusions for the sds hand based map in some cities of the itajaí açu basin this may be explained by the 1d nature of the simulations performed in this study which integrate for each unit catchment the dem based floodplain topography in turn 2d simulations tend to be more sensitive to dem quality and to local scale features smith et al 2018 an important hydrodynamic factor that differentiates the local hec ras model from the mgb versions is the representation of hydraulic controls such as rapids waterfalls or channel constraints in the former what may play an important role even in large rivers hydrodynamics frasson et al 2017 garambois et al 2017 o loughlin et al 2013 in the itajaí açu basin for example important controls occur downstream of rio do sul city and along most of the basin generating backwater effects and controlling upstream hydrodynamic processes in regional modeling approaches such local features i e at scales smaller than a 1 km reach are not fully represented in this context further research could be developed to infer the optimum reach length for regional models that best represents local features similar to the hydraulic visibility concept proposed by garambois et al 2017 which aimed to assess the potential of satellite altimetry tracks to describe local hydraulic features e g changes in water level slopes it could also build upon the guidelines by samuels 1990 and castellarin et al 2009 on the optimal location and spacing of cross sections or on the suggestion by grimaldi et al 2018 for estimating river width values from remote sensing imagery near particular geomorphologic features the local mgb modelling approach involved inserting the surveyed cross sections through their bankfull width effective bankfull depth i e wetted area divided by bankfull width and bank elevation values the approximation of rectangular cross sections was adopted which is a common assumption in large scale hydrodynamic models neal et al 2012 de paiva et al 2013 schumann et al 2016 trigg et al 2009 and this seemed to be satisfactory to estimate water levels indeed many itajaí açu sections tend to be relatively rectangular fig 4 and recent studies have showed the capacity of rectangular channels to simulate flooding processes fewtrell et al 2011 grimaldi et al 2018 trigg et al 2009 one further possibility would be to use the cross section hydraulic radius within the model neal et al 2012 or by using an effective channel shape parameter grimaldi et al 2018 neal et al 2015 for locally relevant estimates a correct cross section shape plays a major role on flood wave propagation and definition of the outflow hydrograph shape in general collischonn et al 2017 mejia and reed 2011 in the case of regional and global models the global database by andreadis et al 2013 provided a satisfactory bankfull width estimate but an underestimated depth which lowered the global model performance while the regional based one proved reasonable for both variables also bank elevation estimation from average srtm pixels above river pixels implies that bankfull depth becomes an effective parameter since the estimated elevation represents the water level at the moment of srtm shuttle passage this explains why an intermediate bankfull depth between global and local estimates led to an optimum flood extent assuming the 1d hec ras simulations as a proxy of locally relevant hydrodynamic variables is reasonable given the widespread use of this software in practical reach scale engineering studies the large number of surveyed cross sections 620 used in the itajaí açu basin and the high density in some relevant urban centers e g rio do sul and itajaí cities points to a higher confidence in the hec ras estimates in the case of itajaí açu basin flow tends to be 1d with storage zone floodplains along the channel mainstem for most basin but the downstream itajaí city region in the urban areas of the lower itajaí açu floods occur rather in a 2d flow pattern and current modeling developments point towards efficient 2d numerical simulations with new software s like hec ras 2d and lisflood fp bates and de roo 2000 neal et al 2012 although this is not still the reality in practical hydrologic engineering especially in developing countries on the other hand studies diverge on the comparison between 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models and 1d models have been proven to perform satisfactorily if detailed topography is available cook and merwade 2009 horritt and bates 2002 hodges 2013 suggests that a complementary strategy between 1d 2d and 3d approaches should be pursued furthermore model structure differences between mgb and hec ras did not seem very relevant i e active hec ras floodplain manning s n set as 0 1 and inactive floodplains mgb and full saint venant hec ras and inertial equations mgb based on bates et al 2010 floodplain attenuation with mgb local version was very similar to hec ras when discharges were compared and indeed past studies showed small hydrodynamic model sensitivity to floodplain friction in 2d models horritt and bates 2002 differences between the two numerical solutions were evaluated by fan et al 2014 in a variety of channel geometries and were also considered small 4 3 perspectives on the improvement of regional global hydrodynamic models this study outcomes can be used to suggest directions for the improvement of regional and continental models in hydrodynamic modeling i e open channel and floodplain flows the physics is relatively well known hodges 2013 but the use of regional to continental models for local scale estimates is still hampered by many difficulties as highlighted in this study e g imperfect cross sections and coarse resolutions on the other hand to a certain spatial scale all models will be rejected schumann et al 2008 and there must be taken into account the tradeoff between resolution and accuracy in hyper resolution models bierkens et al 2015 dottori et al 2013 and the epistemic uncertainty that arises when moving towards local scales cross section parameterization from this study s results the largest gain towards locally relevant water levels would be obtained by using better cross sections parameters with more correct estimates of bankfull width and depth and bank elevation values at the basin scale an interesting perspective in this context relates to low cost remote sensing datasets bates et al 2014 schumann et al 2009 yan et al 2015 and its assimilation in hydrodynamic models to estimate cross section geometry and water levels durand et al 2008 tourian et al 2017 yoon et al 2012 as well as for model calibration and validation fleischmann et al 2018 de paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 future missions such as swot biancamaria et al 2016 and ice sat 2 abdalati et al 2010 promise to bring more valuable altimetry information to models satellite imagery processing and classification of water masks seem to be the natural way forward to estimate basin scale river widths pavelsky and smith 2008 pekel et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2014a alternatively new robust methods for estimating regional geomorphic relationships are welcome in this case one should be careful when selecting in situ cross sections to derive these relations for example in many ungauged basins there is availability of local cross sections only for the locations of water level gauges which tend to be located in incised valleys and may not be representative of the whole reach meyer et al 2018 trigg et al 2009 and domeneghetti 2016 present hec ras based comparisons and suggestions of regional like estimates of channel cross section with better bathymetry datasets computational power improving simulation time e g for floor forecasting and computational storage capacity for instance to allow the simulated reach lengths to be decreased is also a major concern to foster regional to continental hydrodynamic models today it is extremely tough to use high resolution products as the 1 m sds dem for a whole basin due to insufficient computational power and the community should move toward new methods that can deal with too much topographic data gomes et al 2015 hodges 2013 on the other hand the presented hec ras model application at large basin scale with 600 in situ cross sections is uncommon in literature with recent computational power there a few examples of hec ras applications at large scales in contrast to typical reach scale ones with complex drainage network which are encouraging for improved flood estimation these include hec ras applications in the ohio river basin for flood forecasting with over 3100 cross sections and a large number of lateral structures and storage areas adams et al 2018 and simulation of the brazilian pantanal and the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta in bangladesh with 340 bravo et al 2012 paz et al 2010 and 226 locally surveyed cross sections siddique e akbor et al 2011 respectively recent advances now enable the control of hec ras inputs runs and output post processing with automated routines in matlab leon and goodell 2016 and other programming languages avoiding the time consuming process to deal with hundreds of cross sections in hec ras paz et al 2010 digital elevation models although in this study the 1d model outputs proved the srtm dem to be satisfactory in comparison to sds dem higher quality dem s are required for local scale flood mapping and recent advances are encouraging e g yamazaki et al 2017 in turn while flood defenses are not common in the itajaí açu basin it is recognized that the incorporation of flood defenses is a major challenge for global models to provide local estimates de moel et al 2015 and there is a demand for improving global datasets of such structures regarding model structure moving towards 2d simulation at continental to global scales is very promising especially for flood hazard estimation while coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes seems to be relevant in region with intense feedbacks between them e g wetland evapotranspiration and regional climate feedbacks in large wetlands bierkens 2015 semi arid basins fleischmann et al 2018 necessity of cross scale comparisons cross scale assessments are required together with comparisons between global models and local inundations maps alfieri et al 2013 sampson et al 2015 wing et al 2017 while in hydrologic modeling such comparisons and discussions are common archfield et al 2015 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 hattermann et al 2017 kumar et al 2013 samaniego et al 2017 this is not the case among river hydrodynamic models hodges 2013 certainly because continental hydrodynamic models are still in their infancy ward et al 2018 the importance of comparing global flood models were highlighted by the global flood partnership trigg et al 2016a and recently hoch and trigg 2018 proposed a general framework to consistently evaluate global flood models considering different model validation and benchmarking strategies in a near future global models could adopt the regional approaches presented in this study largely improving its estimates toward locally relevant ones methods to upscale local estimates of river hydrodynamic parameters e g cross section and roughness to coarse scale models in order to achieve coherent fluxes at all scales are also welcome e g samaniego et al 2017 a recent comparison between six global flood models by trigg et al 2016b and bernhofen et al 2018 showed major mismatches between them in estimating flood extent in africa discrepancies occurred mainly due to different model structures while spatial resolution was not a major driver more cross scale evaluations could improve our understanding of the factors driving the differences among these models for example by comparing global and local models results at the unit catchment cross section local scale with this study it was possible to understand in which parts of the basin there was higher confidence in the local level estimates which is important since certain locations in the floodplain e g an industrial park will be more relevant for a particular evaluation pappenberger et al 2007 in terms of modeling strategy siqueira et al 2018 compared a bottom up approach i e applying a model initially developed for basin scales to a whole continent domain with a top down one i e evaluating continental scale estimates from global models and discussed the complementary strategies that could be used towards more satisfactory estimates e g by using regional expert knowledge from the bottom up approach into the top down one in this study a first of its kind comparison was performed between local detailed hec ras or local based mgb hydrodynamic model and regional continental models global and regional based mgb models to investigate the limits of each model 5 conclusion this study presented a cross scale comparison of continental regional and local hydrodynamic modeling approaches based on the mgb large scale hydrologic hydrodynamic model a detailed hec ras model with 620 in situ cross sections and covering over 900 km of river reaches in the itajaí açu river basin in southern brazil was firstly set up then it was used as a reference to evaluate how much those model configurations can represent hec ras estimates discharge water levels and flood extent three main requirements were proposed to define whether a hydrodynamic model yields locally relevant estimates which may be used for future regional global model evaluations the model errors should be equal or smaller i than the accuracy requirement for a particular application and location ii than typical local reach scale models errors and iii than observation uncertainties then main conclusions of this study are global river hydrodynamic models have important limitations in attaining locally relevant estimates but by moving toward more regional methods e g regionally based cross sections they can provide satisfactory water level amplitude and discharge at local scales investing in locally based methods of cross section estimation e g with satellite altimetry assimilation is interesting to improve global hydrodynamic models and seems to be more interesting than improving dem quality especially for 1d models moving towards local approaches by refining reach lengths and dem and by using locally surveyed cross sections could improve water level estimates basin wide average rmse of 2 1 m in comparison to 4 4 m with regional approach and 26 1 m with the global one long reach lengths e g 15 km may be unsuitable to represent discharges and water levels in basins like the itajaí açu river basin 15 000 km2 especially for steep reaches and adopting 1 km and 5 km lengths are preferable for estimating flood extent the local model yielded better estimates for the rio do sul city location average f 52 while for itajaí city global regional and local models led to similar results f between 36 and 41 the overall low f values suggest a difficulty of continental and regional models to infer flood extent at local scales the assessment of global regional models at cross section unit catchment scale as performed in this study provides an interesting picture of the model capacity to represent local hydrodynamic features as backwater effects and evaluation of longitudinal water level profiles may assist this analysis finally cross scale comparisons are fundamental to understand how far can current state of the art river hydrodynamic models go and to which direction should we move to in future developments we hope this study provides new insights on the ways forward for regional to global models declaration of interests none acknowledgements the first author would like to thank cnpq for

8612,regional to global river hydrodynamic models are now a reality and have largely improved in the recent years due to increasing computation power remote sensing datasets and new modeling methods it is fundamental then to understand to which extent these models can provide locally relevant estimates of variables as discharge and water levels it is addressed here by setting up three different versions of the large scale mgb hydrologic hydrodynamic model with increasing spatial scale global regional and local based on different topography datasets cross section parameterization and reach lengths these model versions are then compared to a detailed hec ras model set up with 620 locally surveyed cross sections in the itajaí açu basin in brazil all models are run with calibrated rainfall runoff parameters so that effects of non calibrated runoff fields or uncertain forcing data are not taken into consideration to assist interpretation three main requirements to define estimates from a river hydrodynamic model as locally relevant are defined the model errors should be equal or smaller i than the accuracy requirement for a particular application and location ii than typical local reach scale models errors and iii than observation uncertainties results then indicate that the regional and local mgb versions and to a lesser extent the global one could estimate locally relevant discharges and water level anomalies for many parts of the basin for absolute water levels all models failed to provide rmse smaller than 0 4 m basin wide although the local mgb model yields an average 2 1 m rmse in comparison to 4 4 m regional and 26 1 m global for flood extent all model versions generally yielded unsatisfactory results with average fit metric values smaller than 65 lastly different setups of the regional mgb model were run to investigate the role of different factors in improving model estimates results showed that a coarse reach length 15 km is unable to capture flood dynamics and water level variations in the basin while a smaller 1 km long reach improves discharges water level and flood extent a locally derived dem did not lead to significant improvements in relation to a global dem in turn the smallest water level errors would be attained by using information from the in situ cross sections in the regional models this study s outcomes are encouraging for the future development of regional to global hydrodynamic models with new remote sensing techniques and higher computational power improving cross section estimation and model discretization keywords 1d hydrodynamic modeling regional scale continental scale modeling cross scale comparison hec ras 1 introduction large scale river hydrodynamic models are powerful tools for water resources studies

reproduce streamflows archfield et al 2015 siqueira et al 2018 and other variables that are locally relevant since they are often forced with non calibrated runoff fields or applied with non locally adjusted hydrodynamic parameters model improvements in this direction involve the inclusion of human induced changes and water uses in global hydrologic models döll et al 2009 and better hydrodynamic

possibility of modeling flow bifurcations and complex drainage network patterns which tend to be simplified in global models with both 1d or 2d hydrodynamic approaches altenau et al 2017 fleischmann

role in national to basin scale water resources management on the other hand local hydrodynamic models have a much higher degree of customization since their applications e g development of detailed

typically use locally surveyed cross sections and represent detailed river engineering structures e g bridges and levees fewtrell et al 2011 heine and pinter 2012 in many cases worldwide high resolution and high accuracy data sets are available for river reaches under flood risk grimaldi et al 2018 providing more locally relevant estimates a cross scale comparison is therefore needed the recent developments of regional to global hydrodynamic models mentioned above naturally invoke the question on whether and to which extent those models can approach local detailed hydrodynamic models and what is the appropriate model complexity altenau et al 2017 to which extent can we use regional to continental models to map and estimate local flood hazard to which degree can we trust discharge and water level estimates from coarse resolution models while the effects of errors in input data and parameterization on hydrodynamic models outputs have been somehow studied in recent literature for both local and regional and for 1d and 2d models altenau et al 2017 cook and merwade 2009 dimitriadis et al 2016 fewtrell et al 2011 hoch et al 2017 horritt and bates 2002 jung and merwade 2015 liu

global regional local are still not understood this comprehension is fundamental for the development and understanding of current regional to continental and global models may mateo et al 2017 de paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2013 so that they ultimately move toward more locally relevant hydrodynamic estimates de moel et al 2015 in this context this paper presents to the knowledge of the authors a first cross scale comparison between global regional and local 1d hydrodynamic modeling strategies a local hec ras model application usace 2010 set up with 850 km of simulated river reaches and over 600 in situ cross sections is compared with different local regional and global applications based on the large scale mgb model pontes et al 2017 multiple tests are performed to address different levels of customization in hydrodynamic modeling varying cross section shape floodplain topography and length computations 2 methods 2 1 methodology overview and experimental design this study is divided in two main parts i a cross scale hydrodynamic model intercomparison and ii an analysis of the drivers of the differences in model performance in the first part three different model configurations are set up based on the mgb hydrologic hydrodynamic model with increasing scale modeling approaches called henceforth global regional and local mgb models these three configurations are compared to a locally based hec ras hydrodynamic model for the itajaí açu river basin in southern brazil for which there was availability of 620 in situ surveyed cross sections and a locally developed digital elevation model dem the goal of this part is to assess how locally relevant are the different model configurations considering the locally developed hec ras model as a reference benchmark as assumed in many practical hydraulic engineering studies the compared hydrodynamic models are forced with the same calibrated rainfall runoff parameters so that uncertainties related to hydrological inputs e g simulated runoff fields were not considered the three mgb model configurations are based on typically adopted approaches for the respective scales as summarized by table 1 three main factors were defined to differ hydrodynamic modeling approaches at the different scales i spatial discretization given by river reach length ii adopted dem to estimate floodplain topography and channel bank elevations and iii cross section geometry reach length refers to the equal distance segments in which the drainage network is divided and ultimately affects the length and number of computational units in the simulated domain and the estimated bank elevation which is computed from the average pixel elevations above the reach see siqueira et al 2018 supplementary material for description of the method the adopted dem is used to define floodplain topography and the reach bank elevation in turn the mgb cross section geometry is set as a rectangular cross section as typically adopted in regional to global models and thus channel bankfull depth and width values are required as model parameters the global model version uses a global database of cross section geometry andreadis et al 2013 srtm dem at 500 m spatial resolution and a reach length of 15 km this is analogous to the mgb continental application by siqueira et al 2018 the regional model adopts a basin scale derived geomorphic relationship between cross section bankfull width and depth and drainage area 30 m srtm dem and a reach length of 5 km finally in the local model the 620 cross sections parameters estimated bankfull width bankfull depth and bank elevation are directly inserted into the respective model reaches where they are located while for those reaches without surveyed cross sections the basin scale geomorphic relationship is used a locally developed dem hereforth called sds see dem description in 2 3 datasets section at 30 m is used together with 1 km long reaches the hec ras model was defined as the local truth and was developed by directly including the 620 cross sections within the model domain which covered the most important river reaches across the itajaí açu basin the second part of the study aims at understanding which factors drive the differences found among the three models configurations then the regional mgb model is set as a reference and different configurations are evaluated alone by varying reach length dem and cross section geometry for all tests the different mgb model configurations were run with the same rainfall runoff model parameters and the hec ras model was forced with mgb model discharges derived from the regional model version the models were run for the extreme 1983 flood in the itajaí açu river basin and the predicted discharge water level water level anomaly and flood extent were analyzed 2 2 study area the itajaí açu river basin in southern brazil fig 1 was used as a case study due to its contrasting floodplain geomorphology types and its size being of a suitable spatial scale for regional scale evaluation drainage area of 15 000 km2 and with a large range of slopes and channel width and depths fig 3 a large number of surveyed river cross sections are available together with a locally developed high quality dem the itajaí açu river is formed by three main tributaries the itajaí do oeste itajaí do norte and itajaí do sul rivers there are relevant floodplains throughout the whole basin varying from laterally constrained floodplains with terraces crops as rice to non constrained ones in its most downstream reaches in some reaches river rapids and waterfalls occur and define local hydraulic controls downstream of reaches with river floodplain interactions such as downstream of rio do sul city fig 1a the basin has a long history of damaging floods and today 1 5 million people live within it with most cities located around river floodplains during the extreme 1983 flood which is used for simulations in this study over 90 cities were affected throughout the basin and around 200 000 people were displaced leading to an estimated impairment of r 1 1 billion brazilian currency ceped ufsc 2015 frank 2003 to cope with such disasters three large flood control dams are located in the river three main tributaries recent flood events have also pushed new efforts to improve basin wide flood control including the proposal of new levees and flood control dams making the basin a relevant case study for improving our comprehension of hydrodynamic modeling estimates 2 3 datasets three different dem s were used for the global regional and local mgb model configurations and the hec ras setup table 1 the global and regional ones use the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem farr et al 2007 available at http srtm csi cgiar org at 500 m and 30 m spatial resolutions respectively the local mgb and hec ras models used a dem sds dem developed for the whole santa catarina state in brazil by the states s secretary of sustainable economic development sds 2013 available at http sigsc sds sc gov br the dem has a 1 m spatial resolution and an estimated vertical accuracy of 0 39 m to allow data management it was upscaled to 10 m for hec ras and to 30 m for the mgb local model version to be comparable with srtm spatial resolution all dem s were converted to brazilian sirgas2000 mapgeo2015 geoid model ibge 2015 because sds dem and in situ cross sections were referenced to it differences between mapgeo2015 and egm96 srtm s datum data in the region ranged from around 0 6 to 0 6 m fig 2 presents hand height above nearest drainage rennó et al 2008 terrain maps derived from the srtm 500 m srtm 30 m and sds 30 m for the locations of rio do sul and itajaí cities see fig 1 for location these maps highlight the extensive floodplains occurring along these areas as well as the large differences between the dem s it is noticeable the better description of terrain elements such as roads and urban areas in the sds dem in comparison to srtm 30 m which features a pronounced speckle noise a total of 620 locally surveyed river cross sections were used which are displayed in fig 1b a post processing was performed to complement all sections that did not cover the full lateral extent of the river floodplains with the sds dem at 10 m spatial resolution channel bankfull width and depth values were required for the mgb runs which adopts a rectangular cross section for simulation for the global model configuration the global database developed by andreadis et al 2013 was used fig 3 which was based on regressions between these variables and average annual discharge the regional model used a basin scale i e regional regression between these variables and drainage area based on the 620 locally surveyed cross sections and by adjusting a rectangular cross section to each section i e bankfull depth estimated by dividing wetted area by bankfull width examples of the adjusted rectangular cross sections are presented in fig 4 finally the local model used average cross sections values for the model river reaches where the sections were located while for the basin areas without cross sections the regional regression was adopted fig 3 presents the estimates with 95 confidence intervals for global and basin scale regressions which show that the global estimates include the local based ones within the 95 interval for bankfull width but underestimate bankfull depth values 2 4 mgb hydrologic hydrodynamic model the mgb model collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 is a semi distributed hydrologic hydrodynamic model developed for large scale basins the basin is divided into unit catchments that are further split into hydrologic response units hru s for which vertical hydrological processes are computed evapotranspiration soil infiltration and surface subsurface and groundwater flow generation runoff generated within each unit catchment is routed along the drainage network with the local inertial approximation of saint venant equations proposed by bates et al 2010 in this section the hydrodynamic module is focused and the reader is referred to pontes et al 2017 and siqueira et al 2018 for a more detailed explanation of rainfall runoff model conceptualization and parameters in the current version of the model siqueira et al 2018 supp material unit catchments are defined as the local drainage area of river segments for this the drainage network is segmented into constant length reaches which varied from 1 km to 15 km in the performed tests then for the model configurations based on the 30 m spatial resolution dem s the 1 km based model led to 4444 unit catchments while the 5 km 15 km one had 1118 614 units for the 500 m dem model run the drainage network slightly differed from the 30 m one so that the number of unit catchments changed to 573 for 5 km and 945 for 15 km long reaches one rectangular cross section is defined for each unit catchment reach with bank elevation channel bankfull width and depth and manning s coefficient as main parameters hydraulic geometry theory leopold and maddock 1953 is used to estimate bankfull width and depth based on simple geomorphic relationships e g by relating these values to local drainage area in this study this strategy was adopted by using different relationships of cross section geometry with drainage area based on global or regional estimates see section 2 3 datasets for details for each unit catchment average bankfull elevation was estimated from a linear regression of all dem pixels above the unit catchment river pixels floodplain topography i e level area relationships for each unit catchment was extracted with a hand rennó et al 2008 based algorithm these pre processing steps are described in siqueira et al 2018 supplementary material the explicit inertial numerical scheme bates et al 2010 is run at a time step defined by courant friedrichs lewy condition with a stability alpha parameter set to 0 2 in this application downstream boundary condition in the basin outlet to atlantic ocean was set as a zero elevation to be consistent with the hec ras application mgb model rainfall runoff parameters were adjusted with observed discharges and are not presented here for brevity for the tests performed in this study the july 1983 flood event was selected due to its extreme nature and the simulated discharges at hourly time step during the event simulation period from 1st june 1982 to 1st august 1983 to include spin up period were used to force the hec ras model 2 5 detailed hydraulic model the 1d hec ras hydrodynamic model usace 2010 outputs were adopted as a proxy of locally relevant variables due to the software s widespread use in hydraulic engineering applications the software solves the full saint venant equations with a preissmann four point implicit scheme a model application including 620 in situ surveyed cross sections was set up covering 863 km of river reaches in the itajaí açu river basin and including all the main basin tributaries fig 1b a post processing was performed to complement the sections to the whole floodplain area with the sds 10 m for those sections that did not cover the whole floodplain in river reaches with low cross section density the sections were linearly interpolated to improve numerical representation fig 4 presents three cross sections located in different parts of the itajaí açu mainstem as an example the adjusted rectangular cross sections used to derive the regional scale geomorphic relationship are also displayed as boundary conditions hec ras was forced with mgb regional model simulated discharges as contributing upstream hydrographs for upstream sections as contributing lateral inflow for the tributaries not represented in hec ras and as local runoff generated for the mgb unit catchments located within each cross section at the downstream boundary condition sea level was adopted at elevation zero manning s roughness coefficient was set as 0 035 for channel and 0 1 for floodplains basin wide following general river hydrodynamic applications chow 1959 usace 2016 2 6 performance metrics four main hydrodynamic variables were evaluated in this study discharge water level i e absolute water level water level anomaly i e hourly level subtracted from long term average level and maximum flood extent for the first three ones the global regional and local mgb model versions were compared to hec ras at each river cross section with the metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse it ranges from to 1 where 1 is the optimum value for discharge and root mean square error rmse it ranges from 0 to where 0 is the optimum value for water levels the 620 cross sections enabled then a basin scale comparison of the models different runs of the regional model are performed in section 3 2 by changing reach length dem and cross sections to evaluate the difference between mean values and to create a performance ranking for each factor a paired student s t test was performed between each pair of boxplots at a 95 significance level following the method for two samples with different variances described by naghettini 2017 maximum flood extent was evaluated with the fit metric f bates and de roo 2000 sometimes referred to as critical success index eq 1 1 f 100 a b a b where a and b are the observed i e hec ras and simulated i e mgb global regional and local model configurations flood extents for a given area f ranges from 0 to 100 where 100 is the optimum value the metric was computed for each unit catchment with maximum flood fraction higher than 10 in the hec ras simulation located within two main floodable areas rio do sul and itajaí city locations fig 1b in order to compare models with different spatial resolution global 500 m regional and local 30 m hec ras 10 m all flood maps were resampled to 10 m with a nearest neighbor algorithm 3 results 3 1 cross scale comparison simulated maximum water level longitudinal profiles for two rivers itajaí açu mainstem and trombudo see fig 1 for location with high cross section density are presented in fig 5 results are displayed for hec ras and the global regional and local mgb model configurations the global one is very limited to estimate absolute water level in comparison to the regional and local ones its coarse resolution 15 km is also evident in contrast to 5 km 1 km for regional local models a detail with a zoom in the itajaí açu middle reaches 60 120 km is also provided and further stresses the differences between the local with local insertion of cross sections and regional models and the closer results between local and hec ras estimates fig 6 shows discharge water level and water level anomaly time series at rio do sul indaial and blumenau cities along itajaí açu mainstem see fig 1 for location peak discharge delay and reduction by the global model are associated with exaggerated floodplain attenuation while local and regional ones are much closer to hec ras for example peak discharge differences are 2 and 12 for local and global models for rio do sul and 3 and 20 for blumenau locations the global setup overestimates absolute water level in the three locations indicating that its coarse resolution and reach length may hamper its use for precise local water level estimation it is interesting to note how satisfactory were the regional and local simulations in rio do sul especially considering the rapids and hydraulic controls existent downstream of it which are represented in hec ras but not in mgb on the other hand in terms of water level anomaly in indaial all models are relatively satisfactory while in rio do sul and blumenau the amplitude is smaller in the global model due to excessive floodplain the performance for discharge nse metric water level rmse and water level anomaly rmse variables is summarized in the boxplots of fig 7 which plot for each model configuration the performance of all 620 cross sections average and standard deviation including all outliers values of the metrics are displayed below each model name the local model outperforms the regional one only on the absolute water level estimates while the differences to global estimates are significantly high and suggest that the latter s water levels are unsatisfactory for local scale usage as observed in fig 6 with water level time series for this variable the local model also leads to less dispersion on its estimates for discharge and water level anomaly estimation both regional and local models provide similar results boxplots related to flood extent f metric are presented in fig 7 for all unit catchments and separately for itajaí and rio do sul locations which present different floodplain geomorphologies in rio do sul the floodplain features a highly constrained lateral extent following the description by hunter et al 2007 which could be understood as similar to a two stage compound channel in turn the lower itajaí açu around itajaí city has a more unconstrained lateral extent where a binary flood extent map would be more difficult to estimate all model versions have similar performance in itajaí with f averages between 36 and 43 while the local mgb outperforms the others in rio do sul with 52 against 39 and 34 f values the regional model has a larger interquartile range than the others in both areas to further understand the spatial differences between the models the performance of discharge water level and water level anomaly variables for each cross section is presented in the fig 8 maps the colors represent different performance classes ranging from blue satisfactory to red unsatisfactory and allows interpretation of where each model could provide a locally relevant estimate which are defined here as a class with discharge nse 0 9 or water level rmse 0 4 m see discussion in section 4 1 firstly it is clear that the global model performs poorly for both discharge and water level variables while for water level anomaly the three model configurations are reasonable major areas of poor global discharge estimation are the upstream headwaters and the lower itajaí açu which are coincident with steep reaches and areas subjected to major flooding respectively also most cross sections present discharge nse 0 9 and water level anomaly rmse 0 4 m for regional and local models indicating that for these two variables there would be a satisfactory confidence in the predictions in many points only a few isolated locations present discharge estimates with nse 0 6 red points in many cases due to bifurcation channels which were represented in the hec ras model in turn for absolute water level only in a few isolated cross sections does the local model perform well rmse 0 4 m stressing its general difficulty of accurately estimating levels along the itajaí açu mainstem reaches at chainage 100 150 km see water level longitudinal profile in fig 5 present the worst absolute water level estimations red to orange cross sections what can be explained by the steep channels that occur in this part in the lower itajaí açu near its mouth i e reaches subjected to backwater effects by the downstream boundary condition the model provided satisfactory estimates of water level anomaly rmse 0 4 m and relatively good absolute water level rmse 1 m maximum flood extent maps are presented in fig 9 for the locations of rio do sul and itajaí cities fig 1b f values are presented for the whole area extent and represent how accurate are the mgb runs in comparison to hec ras for rio do sul the local mgb model f 45 performed better than both regional f 35 and global f 26 ones in accordance with fig 7 boxplots in itajaí city all model versions had similar performance ranging from 38 regional to 42 global and 44 local flooded areas in itajaí were also much larger than rio do sul ones the relatively low values 50 suggest a difficulty in all mgb model configurations to estimate this variable what could be improved by calibrating channel depth for example the next section will address the relative effects of cross section geometry dem and reach length on these results 3 2 on the drivers of cross scale differences in order to understand the differences between global regional and local model runs from the previous section 3 1 here a set of simulations is performed by considering the regional mgb model as a reference and by changing its main components i e reach length dem and cross section geometry fig 10 summarizes the results for discharge water level absolute and anomaly and flood extent by presenting boxplots for each model configuration considering the mgb model performance in relation to hec ras simulations for the ensembles of cross sections discharge and water level and unit catchments flood extent itajaí and rio do sul regions are plotted together in this analysis in contrast to the previous 3 1 section discharge results indicate a model improvement by using 1 km long reaches in comparison to 5 and 15 km while for dem and cross sections the regional and local configurations are similar i e srtm 30 and sds 30 and regional and local geometries respectively and perform better than the global one differences between srtm and sds at 30 m do not seem to be relevant in terms of stored volume in the river floodplains system even considering the higher speckle noise in srtm hand maps in fig 2 in the global application both dem srtm 500 m and global geometry with smaller bankfull depths led to higher flooding and thus discharge underestimation and smaller nse for water level the 1 km long reach and the local geometry configurations i e the local approaches improved model estimates while regional dem srtm 30 m performed better than the local one sds 30 m the 15 km length seems to be inadequate to represent the flood dynamics in the itajaí açu river basin especially if considered some steep reaches with relevant changes in river bed elevation moving from 15 km to 5 km lengths water level rmse would be improved from 15 8 m to 4 4 m the smallest water level rmse 2 7 m would be obtained by improving regional model cross sections towards more local estimates the behavior of water level anomaly was different from the other variables since all evaluated model configurations showed a similar performance for this variable the global modelling approach performed worse than the regional and local ones only when analyzing cross section geometry local geometry led to significantly smaller water level anomaly average rmse than the regional one although the values were relatively similar 0 8 and 0 7 m flood extent boxplots indicate that the 1 km reach would lead to better average f values 51 37 and 26 while both srtm 30 m 37 and sds 30 m 34 dem s would outperform srtm 500 m 24 the global based cross section geometry obtained the best performance 68 in comparison to regional 27 and local 40 estimates although this result may be somehow surprising it may be explained by the relatively smaller global bankfull depths if compared to local ones fig 3 what led to much more flooding and a better f metric however as observed in fig 6 the global model tends to exaggerate discharge attenuation with too much flooding basin wide global model flood extent extended to the whole floodplain domain i e behaving as a laterally constrained floodplain and water depth maps not presented here for brevity showed that floodplain depths were indeed higher in the global model than hec ras estimates this indicates that the optimum flooding estimation would be attained by adopting an intermediate bankfull depth value i e between local and global estimates in such laterally constrained floodplains flood extent may not be a suitable metric to be evaluated in such cases hunter et al 2007 4 discussion 4 1 on the definition of locally relevant estimates in the context of regional global hydrodynamic models regional to global hydrodynamic models are now a reality and have been proven to yield better estimates than non hydrodynamic ones for variables as discharge water surface elevation and flood extent in many locations siqueira et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 although global models should be used for the purposes they were designed for de moel et al 2015 ward et al 2018 it is a major and open question whether their estimates could be deemed as locally relevant or to which scale could they be trusted the goal of attaining locally relevant estimates everywhere with global models have been recently discussed in the literature bierkens 2015 bierkens et al 2015 döll et al 2016 pau et al 2016 wada 2016 however a precise definition of what a locally relevant variable is and how it could be used as a measure of model performance is not yet available the variable of interest itself depends on the model application e g in flood related studies water depths are more relevant for evaluating damage to buildings while velocity are interesting for bridges and time and duration of flooding for agricultural crops de moel et al 2015 three main requirements for attaining locally relevant estimates in the context of river hydrodynamic models are then proposed table 2 the errors of a regional to global model should be equal or smaller i than the accuracy requirement for a particular application and location ii than typical local reach scale models errors and iii than observation uncertainties even more if there is no information available for a particular location e g absence of in situ data or local models a global model will naturally be locally relevant although it may present large yet possibly unknown errors the first is more subjective and depends on the local landscape e g channel slope floodplain geomorphology and river water level amplitude and social factors e g floodplain occupation and local water agencies stakeholders community perception of the river system pappenberger et al 2007 and thus it is not straightforward to define a general threshold of locally relevance for flood forecasting very short term forecasts e g within hours may require high accuracy estimates at the centimeter scale while longer leading times e g a few days may accept errors at the meter scale since each forecast will have a different role in the disaster management if deterministic thresholds are adopted e g warning alert flood level todini 2018 these may be used to define the required accuracy in flood damage estimation e g for flood insurance companies or flood risk estimation by governmental agencies sensitivity of damage to different water levels in level damage relationships could be used to define thresholds above which errors are not acceptable the expected accuracy should also take into consideration that higher uncertainties may exist to define exposure and vulnerability than hazard itself apel et al 2009 jongman et al 2012 schröter et al 2014 in the case of river structures such as reservoirs and levees acceptable estimation errors tend to be small i e few centimeters in the united states for example levees are only allowed to be constructed if a local water level increase smaller than 30 5 cm 1 feet is estimated for a 100 year flood heine and pinter 2012 in turn for studies related to water quality and biogeochemical cycles carbon nitrogen phosphorus it is understood that important retention occurs in very small water bodies as lakes reservoirs and wetlands bouwman et al 2013 so that this small scale features should be well represented in hydrodynamic models the same occurs when analyzing sediments with relevant small scale processes such as sediment trapping river bank erosion and bed load transport bierkens et al 2015 for water quality and sediments small bias 10 and a satisfactory dynamics e g by adopting correlation coefficient values 0 8 of discharge velocity and residence time should be pursued for climatic and environmental impacts studies the models should attain errors smaller than the magnitude of changes e g smaller than the estimated increase in discharge under climate change for studies focusing on comprehension of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes fleischmann et al 2018 de paiva et al 2013 models should have errors smaller than the physical signals e g smaller than water level amplitude along a floodplain if analyzing this variable the second requirement is related to the capacity of locally developed hydrodynamic models i e state of the art models as 1d or 2d hec ras set up with detailed cross sections in representing local features this would be the maximum attainable performance for global models studies in the literature suggest that reach scale models obtain water level errors rmse typically between 0 1 and 0 4 m adams et al 2018 altenau et al 2017 apel et al 2009 bermúdez et al 2017 fewtrell et al 2011 matgen et al 2007 rudorff et al 2014 what may differ if the assessed rmse metric refers to at a station water level series water depth level maps or longitudinal level profiles for flood extent the f fit metric has typical values above 65 altenau et al 2017 horritt and bates 2002 tayefi et al 2007 depending on the floodplain geomorphology hunter et al 2007 the assessment of simulated discharge performance depends on the goal of the study minimum mean maximum flows but using the commonly adopted nash sutcliffe metric one could argue that a 0 9 value could be a locally relevant threshold bermúdez et al 2017 moriasi et al 2015 suggest a very good nse above 0 8 lastly global regional model errors should be at the same magnitude of observation uncertainties since it is not possible to reduce model errors for values below observation errors i e models should be accepted within a range of observation uncertainty mcmillan et al 2018 schumann et al 2008 it is typically accepted that water level observation errors are much smaller than discharge ones typically less than a few centimeters di baldassarre and montanari 2009 todini 2018 in turn discharge observation errors depend on the employed method velocity area methods may have 8 20 errors in relation to the discharge value pelletier 1988 or errors below 5 with adcp measurements herschy 2014 high uncertainty estimated at 6 2 42 8 by di baldassarre and montanari 2009 occurs when using rating curves to estimate discharge from observed water level especially when high flow extrapolation is performed di baldassarre and montanari 2009 domeneghetti et al 2012 dottori et al 2009 in turn flood extent mapping is subjected to errors associated with image processing and classification methods the physical principle itself e g optical passive and active microwave sensors and the image spatial temporal resolution schumann et al 2009 and the necessity of including the uncertainty of binary flood maps in model calibration validation e g through a fuzzy membership approach for image classification pappenberger et al 2006 has been discussed in the literature horritt 2006 pappenberger et al 2007 2006 schumann et al 2009 2008 classification accuracies usually defined as the percentage of total area with omission errors rarely exceed 90 for synthetic aperture radar sar datasets schumann and moller 2015 hess et al 2003 reported for a classification of jers sar images in the amazon basin accuracies higher than 90 for open water but between 56 and 87 for vegetated flooded areas and clement et al 2018 presented a sar classification technique validated for floods in yorkshire uk with an accuracy higher than 71 5 from the above discussion it is rather complicate to define a threshold for locally relevant estimates being an open and interesting discussion in the scientific community however it is proposed here that water level rmse values above 0 4 m discharge nse above 0 9 and f values above 65 may be suitable thresholds to evaluate global regional models especially for flood studies 4 2 how locally relevant are the regional to global hydrodynamic model estimates assuming the hec ras model as a reference benchmark it was compared to the global regional and local mgb versions in order to understand to which degree can these models estimates be trusted since calibrated rainfall runoff parameters were adopted and not global or regional runoff fields which are typically not calibrated and present important biases siqueira et al 2018 results point to the maximum potentiality of the current hydrodynamic models the global mgb model has limitations in accurately estimating discharge and water levels absolute values and anomalies due to the coarse dem srtm 500 m the adopted reach length 15 km and the cross section with relatively small bankfull depth values from the global database these factors had different effects on each variable water level anomaly was mainly improved with better cross sections locally relevant estimates nse 0 9 rmse 0 4 m and f 65 could only be attained with the global approach for water level anomalies in certain sections along the basin while this was not the case for discharge absolute water level and flood extent on the other hand its performance was relatively satisfactory for discharges and water level anomalies from a global model perspective i e for global assessment of water fluxes with nse 0 6 for most cross sections along itajaí açu mainstem peak discharge differences between local and global models and hec ras ranged from 2 to 12 in rio do sul and 3 20 in blumenau location what may be deemed satisfactory if compared to 5 40 uncertainties in observed discharges and rating curves di baldassarre and montanari 2009 domeneghetti et al 2012 dottori et al 2009 pelletier 1988 moving towards regional modeling approaches i e higher resolution dem regionally derived cross section parameters and finer resolution computation units and reach lengths results outperformed the global model for most analyzed variables although only discharge could be deemed as locally relevant basin wide with the regional model nse 0 9 in turn the local mgb model satisfactorily represented the water longitudinal profile or water slope in the analyzed itajaí açu and trombudo rivers fig 5 which is an interesting signature of river hydrodynamics garambois et al 2017 but it also could not lead to estimates with local relevance rmse of 2 1 m smaller than the proposed threshold of 0 4 m none of the mgb model versions yielded locally relevant estimates of flood extent improving reach lengths to 1 km led to the best f values of 51 on average despite the global cross section scenario which led to exaggerated water depths and flooding but a satisfactory yet meaningless f that may indicate the necessity of better representing local hydrodynamic features moving towards 2d modeling may also be relevant altenau et al 2017 comparisons between global hazard models estimates with locally developed hazard maps reported f values between 45 and 65 for european rivers alfieri et al 2013 59 65 for canadian rivers smith et al 2015 50 55 for united states nationwide fema flood hazard maps wing et al 2017 and 51 90 for selected high quality united states usgs flood hazard maps wing et al 2017 a reach length of 15 km yields poor results of water level profile in the itajaí açu basin global hydrodynamic models use reach lengths even higher than this value yamazaki et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 while large lengths could increase numerical instabilities or numerical diffusion their decrease would lead to much more computational units what may be soon feasible under increasing computation power an interesting conclusion of this study is that the dem source sds 0 39 m vertical accuracy and srtm 6 2 m at 90 m resolution rodríguez et al 2006 was less important than dem spatial resolution 30 m and 500 m and reach length especially for larger reach lengths as 15 km speckhann et al 2018 obtained similar conclusions for the sds hand based map in some cities of the itajaí açu basin this may be explained by the 1d nature of the simulations performed in this study which integrate for each unit catchment the dem based floodplain topography in turn 2d simulations tend to be more sensitive to dem quality and to local scale features smith et al 2018 an important hydrodynamic factor that differentiates the local hec ras model from the mgb versions is the representation of hydraulic controls such as rapids waterfalls or channel constraints in the former what may play an important role even in large rivers hydrodynamics frasson et al 2017 garambois et al 2017 o loughlin et al 2013 in the itajaí açu basin for example important controls occur downstream of rio do sul city and along most of the basin generating backwater effects and controlling upstream hydrodynamic processes in regional modeling approaches such local features i e at scales smaller than a 1 km reach are not fully represented in this context further research could be developed to infer the optimum reach length for regional models that best represents local features similar to the hydraulic visibility concept proposed by garambois et al 2017 which aimed to assess the potential of satellite altimetry tracks to describe local hydraulic features e g changes in water level slopes it could also build upon the guidelines by samuels 1990 and castellarin et al 2009 on the optimal location and spacing of cross sections or on the suggestion by grimaldi et al 2018 for estimating river width values from remote sensing imagery near particular geomorphologic features the local mgb modelling approach involved inserting the surveyed cross sections through their bankfull width effective bankfull depth i e wetted area divided by bankfull width and bank elevation values the approximation of rectangular cross sections was adopted which is a common assumption in large scale hydrodynamic models neal et al 2012 de paiva et al 2013 schumann et al 2016 trigg et al 2009 and this seemed to be satisfactory to estimate water levels indeed many itajaí açu sections tend to be relatively rectangular fig 4 and recent studies have showed the capacity of rectangular channels to simulate flooding processes fewtrell et al 2011 grimaldi et al 2018 trigg et al 2009 one further possibility would be to use the cross section hydraulic radius within the model neal et al 2012 or by using an effective channel shape parameter grimaldi et al 2018 neal et al 2015 for locally relevant estimates a correct cross section shape plays a major role on flood wave propagation and definition of the outflow hydrograph shape in general collischonn et al 2017 mejia and reed 2011 in the case of regional and global models the global database by andreadis et al 2013 provided a satisfactory bankfull width estimate but an underestimated depth which lowered the global model performance while the regional based one proved reasonable for both variables also bank elevation estimation from average srtm pixels above river pixels implies that bankfull depth becomes an effective parameter since the estimated elevation represents the water level at the moment of srtm shuttle passage this explains why an intermediate bankfull depth between global and local estimates led to an optimum flood extent assuming the 1d hec ras simulations as a proxy of locally relevant hydrodynamic variables is reasonable given the widespread use of this software in practical reach scale engineering studies the large number of surveyed cross sections 620 used in the itajaí açu basin and the high density in some relevant urban centers e g rio do sul and itajaí cities points to a higher confidence in the hec ras estimates in the case of itajaí açu basin flow tends to be 1d with storage zone floodplains along the channel mainstem for most basin but the downstream itajaí city region in the urban areas of the lower itajaí açu floods occur rather in a 2d flow pattern and current modeling developments point towards efficient 2d numerical simulations with new software s like hec ras 2d and lisflood fp bates and de roo 2000 neal et al 2012 although this is not still the reality in practical hydrologic engineering especially in developing countries on the other hand studies diverge on the comparison between 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models and 1d models have been proven to perform satisfactorily if detailed topography is available cook and merwade 2009 horritt and bates 2002 hodges 2013 suggests that a complementary strategy between 1d 2d and 3d approaches should be pursued furthermore model structure differences between mgb and hec ras did not seem very relevant i e active hec ras floodplain manning s n set as 0 1 and inactive floodplains mgb and full saint venant hec ras and inertial equations mgb based on bates et al 2010 floodplain attenuation with mgb local version was very similar to hec ras when discharges were compared and indeed past studies showed small hydrodynamic model sensitivity to floodplain friction in 2d models horritt and bates 2002 differences between the two numerical solutions were evaluated by fan et al 2014 in a variety of channel geometries and were also considered small 4 3 perspectives on the improvement of regional global hydrodynamic models this study outcomes can be used to suggest directions for the improvement of regional and continental models in hydrodynamic modeling i e open channel and floodplain flows the physics is relatively well known hodges 2013 but the use of regional to continental models for local scale estimates is still hampered by many difficulties as highlighted in this study e g imperfect cross sections and coarse resolutions on the other hand to a certain spatial scale all models will be rejected schumann et al 2008 and there must be taken into account the tradeoff between resolution and accuracy in hyper resolution models bierkens et al 2015 dottori et al 2013 and the epistemic uncertainty that arises when moving towards local scales cross section parameterization from this study s results the largest gain towards locally relevant water levels would be obtained by using better cross sections parameters with more correct estimates of bankfull width and depth and bank elevation values at the basin scale an interesting perspective in this context relates to low cost remote sensing datasets bates et al 2014 schumann et al 2009 yan et al 2015 and its assimilation in hydrodynamic models to estimate cross section geometry and water levels durand et al 2008 tourian et al 2017 yoon et al 2012 as well as for model calibration and validation fleischmann et al 2018 de paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 future missions such as swot biancamaria et al 2016 and ice sat 2 abdalati et al 2010 promise to bring more valuable altimetry information to models satellite imagery processing and classification of water masks seem to be the natural way forward to estimate basin scale river widths pavelsky and smith 2008 pekel et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2014a alternatively new robust methods for estimating regional geomorphic relationships are welcome in this case one should be careful when selecting in situ cross sections to derive these relations for example in many ungauged basins there is availability of local cross sections only for the locations of water level gauges which tend to be located in incised valleys and may not be representative of the whole reach meyer et al 2018 trigg et al 2009 and domeneghetti 2016 present hec ras based comparisons and suggestions of regional like estimates of channel cross section with better bathymetry datasets computational power improving simulation time e g for floor forecasting and computational storage capacity for instance to allow the simulated reach lengths to be decreased is also a major concern to foster regional to continental hydrodynamic models today it is extremely tough to use high resolution products as the 1 m sds dem for a whole basin due to insufficient computational power and the community should move toward new methods that can deal with too much topographic data gomes et al 2015 hodges 2013 on the other hand the presented hec ras model application at large basin scale with 600 in situ cross sections is uncommon in literature with recent computational power there a few examples of hec ras applications at large scales in contrast to typical reach scale ones with complex drainage network which are encouraging for improved flood estimation these include hec ras applications in the ohio river basin for flood forecasting with over 3100 cross sections and a large number of lateral structures and storage areas adams et al 2018 and simulation of the brazilian pantanal and the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta in bangladesh with 340 bravo et al 2012 paz et al 2010 and 226 locally surveyed cross sections siddique e akbor et al 2011 respectively recent advances now enable the control of hec ras inputs runs and output post processing with automated routines in matlab leon and goodell 2016 and other programming languages avoiding the time consuming process to deal with hundreds of cross sections in hec ras paz et al 2010 digital elevation models although in this study the 1d model outputs proved the srtm dem to be satisfactory in comparison to sds dem higher quality dem s are required for local scale flood mapping and recent advances are encouraging e g yamazaki et al 2017 in turn while flood defenses are not common in the itajaí açu basin it is recognized that the incorporation of flood defenses is a major challenge for global models to provide local estimates de moel et al 2015 and there is a demand for improving global datasets of such structures regarding model structure moving towards 2d simulation at continental to global scales is very promising especially for flood hazard estimation while coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes seems to be relevant in region with intense feedbacks between them e g wetland evapotranspiration and regional climate feedbacks in large wetlands bierkens 2015 semi arid basins fleischmann et al 2018 necessity of cross scale comparisons cross scale assessments are required together with comparisons between global models and local inundations maps alfieri et al 2013 sampson et al 2015 wing et al 2017 while in hydrologic modeling such comparisons and discussions are common archfield et al 2015 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 hattermann et al 2017 kumar et al 2013 samaniego et al 2017 this is not the case among river hydrodynamic models hodges 2013 certainly because continental hydrodynamic models are still in their infancy ward et al 2018 the importance of comparing global flood models were highlighted by the global flood partnership trigg et al 2016a and recently hoch and trigg 2018 proposed a general framework to consistently evaluate global flood models considering different model validation and benchmarking strategies in a near future global models could adopt the regional approaches presented in this study largely improving its estimates toward locally relevant ones methods to upscale local estimates of river hydrodynamic parameters e g cross section and roughness to coarse scale models in order to achieve coherent fluxes at all scales are also welcome e g samaniego et al 2017 a recent comparison between six global flood models by trigg et al 2016b and bernhofen et al 2018 showed major mismatches between them in estimating flood extent in africa discrepancies occurred mainly due to different model structures while spatial resolution was not a major driver more cross scale evaluations could improve our understanding of the factors driving the differences among these models for example by comparing global and local models results at the unit catchment cross section local scale with this study it was possible to understand in which parts of the basin there was higher confidence in the local level estimates which is important since certain locations in the floodplain e g an industrial park will be more relevant for a particular evaluation pappenberger et al 2007 in terms of modeling strategy siqueira et al 2018 compared a bottom up approach i e applying a model initially developed for basin scales to a whole continent domain with a top down one i e evaluating continental scale estimates from global models and discussed the complementary strategies that could be used towards more satisfactory estimates e g by using regional expert knowledge from the bottom up approach into the top down one in this study a first of its kind comparison was performed between local detailed hec ras or local based mgb hydrodynamic model and regional continental models global and regional based mgb models to investigate the limits of each model 5 conclusion this study presented a cross scale comparison of continental regional and local hydrodynamic modeling approaches based on the mgb large scale hydrologic hydrodynamic model a detailed hec ras model with 620 in situ cross sections and covering over 900 km of river reaches in the itajaí açu river basin in southern brazil was firstly set up then it was used as a reference to evaluate how much those model configurations can represent hec ras estimates discharge water levels and flood extent three main requirements were proposed to define whether a hydrodynamic model yields locally relevant estimates which may be used for future regional global model evaluations the model errors should be equal or smaller i than the accuracy requirement for a particular application and location ii than typical local reach scale models errors and iii than observation uncertainties then main conclusions of this study are global river hydrodynamic models have important limitations in attaining locally relevant estimates but by moving toward more regional methods e g regionally based cross sections they can provide satisfactory water level amplitude and discharge at local scales investing in locally based methods of cross section estimation e g with satellite altimetry assimilation is interesting to improve global hydrodynamic models and seems to be more interesting than improving dem quality especially for 1d models moving towards local approaches by refining reach lengths and dem and by using locally surveyed cross sections could improve water level estimates basin wide average rmse of 2 1 m in comparison to 4 4 m with regional approach and 26 1 m with the global one long reach lengths e g 15 km may be unsuitable to represent discharges and water levels in basins like the itajaí açu river basin 15 000 km2 especially for steep reaches and adopting 1 km and 5 km lengths are preferable for estimating flood extent the local model yielded better estimates for the rio do sul city location average f 52 while for itajaí city global regional and local models led to similar results f between 36 and 41 the overall low f values suggest a difficulty of continental and regional models to infer flood extent at local scales the assessment of global regional models at cross section unit catchment scale as performed in this study provides an interesting picture of the model capacity to represent local hydrodynamic features as backwater effects and evaluation of longitudinal water level profiles may assist this analysis finally cross scale comparisons are fundamental to understand how far can current state of the art river hydrodynamic models go and to which direction should we move to in future developments we hope this study provides new insights on the ways forward for regional to global models declaration of interests none acknowledgements the first author would like to thank cnpq for

8613,major restructuring including commercialisation of the water authorities in australia during the past several decades has resulted in the loss of much valuable information on dam infrastructure costs this paper sets out to provide an australian perspective on dam costs and dam cost overruns examine patterns of dam costs and cost overruns and develop a good predictor of costs and cost overruns for the australian situation several cost metrics dam costs and related data were collated for 98 dams constructed across australia since 1888 dam costs operation and maintenance o m costs and construction overrun costs were related to independent variables including dam site terrain characteristics and catchment and climate attributes each metric was related through multiple regression to mainly physical and climate attributes associated with the dam multiple correlation coefficients account for between 50 and 80 of the variance in the dependent variable the exceedance range defined as 75 exceedance to 25 exceedance of final dam costs 2016 aud 98 dams is from 393 per ml of reservoir storage to 2040 per ml annual o m costs 33 dams expressed as a of final dam cost varies from 0 14 to 0 35 though these o m costs do not include major upgrades the results of this study of australian dams are in keeping with international studies that have found the estimated costs of large infrastructure projects are systematically biased downwards in this study the median and mean cost overruns 40 dams expressed as a percentage of the dam cost estimated immediately prior to construction are 49 and 120 respectively with the smallest and largest cost overrun values being 48 and 825 respectively based on the available data dam cost overruns appear to be more prevalent in sedimentary rock than hard rock e g igneous and metamorphic rocks settings the strong likelihood of dam cost overruns occurring has implications to forecasted benefit cost ratios and supports assertions that large dam cost and contingency estimates should be checked at pre feasibility and feasibility stages by an independent organisation and by persons highly experienced in dam design construction and costing keywords operation and maintenance cost ancold water resource management reservoir yield multiple regression water supply 1 introduction following a brief hiatus in the late twentieth century there has been a resurgence of interest in the construction of large dams for energy biswas 2012 zarfl et al 2015 and food production pmc 2015 particularly in developing and emerging economies mcmahon and petheram submitted in australia and particularly in the tropical and sub tropical north of the continent the primary driver for government s interest in large dams is regional economic development in this sparsely populated region pmc 2015 however debate around the costs and benefits of large dams continues some observers point out that no country or region in a tropical or sub tropical climate has ever made significant economic progress without adequately harnessing it s water resources biswas 2012 on the other hand critics of large dams point to the high direct costs of constructing large water infrastructure projects and the unpredictable and difficult to quantify indirect environmental and social costs that may result another criticism of large dams and large infrastructure projects in general is that they often result in large cost overruns e g pickrell 1990 fouracre et al 1990 skamris and flyvbjerg 1996 ansar et al 2014 terrill et al 2016 with a number of authors concluding that estimated values were significantly biased below actual values e g bacon and besant jones 1988 ansar et al 2014 for example in a summary of cost overruns in large infrastructure assets from non australian countries ansar et al 2014 reported the mean cost overruns for construction projects of roads at 20 bridges and tunnels 34 rail 45 mega dams 96 and nuclear power plants 207 odeck and skjeseth 1995 observed that the uncertainties inherent in cost estimates are rarely brought to the attention of decision makers even as a sensitivity analysis information on dam costs and on dam cost overruns are not readily available in australia major restructuring including commercialisation of the water authorities in australia during the past several decades has resulted in the loss of much useful information including infrastructure costs through being mislaid or deliberately disposed of the aim in publishing this paper is to provide an australian perspective on dam costs and dam cost overruns to examine patterns of dam costs and cost overruns and to develop a good predictor of costs and schedule overruns for the australian situation this study essentially about dam costs and related project information was initiated over 40 years ago when data on costs of australian dams were acquired through written correspondence with water authorities and other relevant government agencies around australia those data were supplemented by an additional survey in 2012 in this paper we examine the relationships between dependent variables of dam costs cost overruns and operation and maintenance costs o m and independent variables one difference between this paper and previous cost related papers is that the previous papers mostly in the economic literature have tended to focus almost exclusively on predictive factors related to technology size procurement and country economic performance e g bacon and besant jones 1998 while this paper also explores the influence of a wide range of climate hydrology geology and landscape related factors on water infrastructure project costs and cost overruns in australia building on a preliminary analysis by petheram and mcmahon 2012 we have collated a unique data set that has dam costs and related data along with reservoir features terrain information at the dam site catchment and climate attributes the foci of this paper are the costs capital overrun and annual o m of australian dams and their relationships to dam and reservoir features to at site terrain characteristics and to catchment and climate attributes specifically the objectives of the current paper are to i examine patterns of dam capital cost cost overrun and annual o m costs in australia ii develop regression relationships for predicting dam capital cost cost overrun and annual o m costs and provide guidance on the utility of regionally based regression relationships elsewhere in the world and on which variables are likely to explain the most variance following this introduction the data used in the paper are described in section 2 which is followed by section 3 that provides background information explaining some features of dam development in australia patterns and simple relationships relating to dam costs in units of 2016 aud australian per ml where ml 103 m3 reservoir storage per ml reservoir yield cost overruns and o m costs are discussed in section 4 in section 5 we discuss the development of regression models to estimate dam costs and related variables some conclusions are drawn in section 6 the supplementary material shows a list of symbols table s1 the full expansion of the köppen geiger climate classification abbreviations table s2 and lists the survey questions table s3 there are also four charts showing the relationship between year of completion and i dam height fig s1 ii dam volume fig s2 iii reservoir volume fig s3 and iv reservoir volume divided reservoir surface area fig s4 a spreadsheet of primary variables is also provided in the supplementary material we have adopted the word dam herein to include the dam wall primary and secondary spillways and outlet structures reservoir is reserved for the water body upstream of the dam wall reservoir capacity is used to describe the volume of the water body upstream of the dam wall at the full supply level fsl and dam volume refers to the volume of material e g concrete earth rock within the dam wall in this paper the term cost overrun refers to the percentage difference between the actual cost of a dam and it s publically stated or contracted cost immediately prior to construction for example if a dam was estimated to cost 100 million but actually cost 150 million the cost overrun would be 50 2 data data for the analyses described in this paper were obtained from several sources a major source of information about dam costs and other project information was collected in the mid 1970s this information was acquired through written correspondence to 23 water authorities and other relevant government agencies around australia for 72 dams those cost data were substantially enhanced with the inclusion of data from frecker 1969 9 sites and additional material in 1974 6 sites in 2012 an additional survey was conducted of 53 relevant australian authorities 17 of which provided additional data 46 sites survey questions are provided in table s3 of the supplementary material these data have been collated with data on dam dimensions storage capacity and spillway size which are documented in a database maintained by the australian national committee on large dams ancold ancold 2010 along with dam site terrain data catchment and climate attributes and related hydrologic information that were calculated for each site as part of this analysis the list of non cost variables used in the regression analysis totalling 132 is provided in supplementary table s1 the dam costs were adjusted to 2016 costs in australian s using the australian bureau of statistics abs consumer price index cpi from 1948 to present prior to 1948 we adopted annual inflation rates based on derived relationship between the australian and united states us cpi values australian and us cpi values tracked very similarly from 1948 to the present r2 0 99 where the construction length was 6 years and the annual cost expenditure data were unavailable 17 dams it was assumed for the purposes of applying inflation factors that three quarters of the expenditure occurred in the middle 50 of years of construction and the remaining 25 of expenditure occurred in the first and last 25 of years this assumption was based on analysis from five dams for which annual expenditure data were available an alternative to using cpi for indexing dam construction costs is to use a construction specific index however relevant construction based indices published by the abs namely the australian heavy and civil engineering construction australia and australian road and bridge construction only exist since 2007 and 1997 respectively and consequently could only be applied to less than 5 of the 98 dams with cost data nevertheless the choice of index may be inconsequential for this analysis where costs extend back many decades in an analysis of australian and international indices ghd meyrick 2011 found that over the long term i e decades increases in construction costs have not exceeded general inflation although there were short periods of several years where construction costs exceeded general inflation and vice versa 3 background information from an initial data set of 564 ancold dams and 133 dams for which we had some cost information we considered four data sets first 224 dams with reservoirs 10 gl in capacity for which dam site terrain catchment and climate attributes were accessible second 98 dams of the 224 for which capital cost data were available third 40 dams of the 98 for which cost overrun data were available and fourth 33 dams of the 98 for which annual o m cost data were available table 1 provides a summary of the key data used in these analyses the exceedance range which is defined in this paper as 75 exceedance to 25 exceedance of final dam costs 2016 aud is 51 m to 209 m or in terms of cost per unit reservoir capacity 393 per ml to 2040 per ml annual o m costs 33 dams expressed as a of final dam capital cost varies from 0 14 to 0 35 the exceedance range of cost overruns 40 dams varies from 20 to 131 with the smallest and largest values being respectively 48 and 825 respectively for the 224 dam data set the exceedance range of dam heights is 24 m to 56 m and the range of reservoir volumes is 23 gl to 190 gl the locations of the 224 dams with reservoirs 10 gl in capacity are identified in fig 1 along with the locations of the 98 dams with capital cost data and 40 dams with cost overrun data in fig 2 the cumulative number and cumulative reservoir capacity of the 98 australian reservoirs examined in this study are plotted against year of completion for comparison the cumulative number of dams against year of completion of the larger data set of 224 reservoirs in australia is also shown two other relevant pieces of background information are the purposes of the reservoirs and the types of dam wall the two major purposes of australian reservoirs examined in this analysis of 98 reservoirs are for water supply residential commercial and industrial at 57 and irrigation at 33 and by reservoir capacity 68 is for irrigation and 19 for water supply 8 of reservoirs and 13 of reservoir capacity are used for hydropower dams constructed as rock embankments account for 42 by number and 56 by reservoir capacity earth embankment dams account for 29 by number but 26 by reservoir capacity and concrete gravity dams account for 22 by number and 17 by reservoir capacity 4 dam costs 4 1 dam capital costs in fig 3 the relationship between the final capital costs 2016 aud of dams including spillways and related infrastructure and a dam wall volume and b dam height for different dam types is examined categorising the data by dam type resulted in a considerable improvement in the relationship over that using all dams r2 multiple correlation coefficient of 0 37 when dam cost is related to dam volume fig 3a but not when dam cost is related to dam height fig 3b the relationships between dam cost and dam volume for concrete arch concrete gravity rockfill embankment and earth embankment dams had r2 of 0 69 0 58 0 63 and 0 42 respectively concrete is a more expensive construction material than rockfill which in turn is more expensive than earthfill concrete arch dams when suitably sited require less concrete than an equivalent concrete gravity dam gehin 1961 but require more formwork and of greater complexity and consequently have higher labour requirements these patterns are reflected in fig 3 the relationship between the final costs 2016 aud of dams and reservoir capacity is moderately strong r2 0 53 n 98 n is sample size fig 4 categorising the dams by reservoir primary purpose strengthened the relationship for those dams which are primarily used for irrigation r2 0 77 n 32 but weakened the relationship for dams whose reservoirs primary purpose was hydro power generation r2 0 27 n 8 and water supply r2 0 32 n 56 the wide variation in results of water supply reservoirs is likely because other factors strongly influence the cost effectiveness of a site for example water supply reservoirs are generally sited in close proximity to the demand particularly if the water is to be piped to maintain water of high quality and that site selection may be constrained by urban and industrial development there are likely to be fewer constraints on the siting of reservoirs for which the primary purpose is irrigation dams can be placed at a suitable location at a considerable distance upstream of the proposed irrigation area and water run down the river to the point of extraction consequently it is thought that the strong relationship is more likely to be due to what is considered an acceptable cost for storing a given volume of water for irrigation purposes than the effect of reservoir capacity on dam cost the wide variation in the costs of water supply dams is indicative of the capacity of urban and industrial users to pay a higher price for water and a political willingness to fund water infrastructure to ensure the water security of urban users than for irrigation users this is likely to be the reason for the weak correlation between unit cost and distance from a capital city shown in fig 5 despite higher costs associated with remoteness such as labour expertise and lack of existing infrastructure further categorising those dams whose reservoirs primary purpose is irrigation by dam type not shown slightly improved the r2 of the dam cost to reservoir capacity relationship r2 0 77 n 32 for earthfill embankment dams r2 0 83 n 9 but weakened the relationship for rockfill embankment dams r2 0 71 n 15 and concrete gravity dams r2 0 68 n 6 two important cost metrics are dam cost per unit of reservoir storage capacity and dam cost per unit of reservoir yield both metrics allow comparisons to be made across different reservoir capacities to do this we use ml fig 6 a shows the relationship between dam cost per ml storage 98 dams and reservoir capacity ml is relatively strong r2 0 64 in fig 6a and later plots reservoir yield ml for 85 annual time based reliability was calculated for each reservoir 89 reservoirs using a behaviour analysis with 115 years of modelled daily inflows generated using 0 05 by 0 05 gridded runoff data obtained from petheram et al 2012 and vaze et al 2013 and incorporating morton s lake evaporation mcmahon et al 2013 an explanation of the application of probability analysis to reservoir yield estimation can be found in mcmahon and adeloye 2005 in fig 6a the relationship involving dam cost per ml yield which for practical purposes is more useful than ml of storage is much weaker r2 0 15 than observed between dam cost per ml storage and reservoir capacity r2 0 64 the poor relationship is likely to be because reservoir capacity is not always a good indicator of yield small capacity weirs and dams may be low yielding if sited in small headwater catchments or relatively high yielding if sited on a large river which is continually replenished categorising the dam cost per ml storage capacity data by reservoir primary purpose fig 6b improved the relationship between ml storage and reservoir capacity for irrigation r2 0 72 and hydropower r2 0 77 dams but not water supply dams r2 0 50 in fig 7 final dam cost per unit storage is plotted against reservoir surface area exhibiting a strong relationship of r2 0 67 it also has a small see standard error of estimate of 0 28 log units the next figure explores the relationship between final dam cost per unit storage and the year of completion of construction fig 8 fig 8 suggests that unit costs i e ml storage in the dam construction industry adjusted for inflation have changed little over time this observation is somewhat counter intuitive because the introduction of new and better technology methods and materials had the effect of making dams cheaper for example in the 1950s the introduction of large earth moving equipment reduced the relative cost of embankment dams doherty 2000 chapter 3 and with the introduction of pre stressed concrete gravity dams in the 1960s and particularly with the introduction of roller compacted concrete dams in australia in the 1980s concrete gravity dams became cost effective again despite the high price of concrete doherty 1999 chapter 4 however from fig 8 it would appear that those factors contributing towards making the construction of dams less expensive than previously were overly compensated by factors making them more expensive these are likely to include an increase in the cost of labour an increased consciousness of dam safety doherty 1999 chapter 4 an increase in costs associated with environmental approvals construction health and safety and simply by virtue of the fact that the best dam sites were developed first and that with growth in the australian population sometimes better dam sites have to be discounted because substantial development has occurred in the reservoir footprint the relationships between dam costs per ml of storage and dam costs per ml of yield and catchment area are explored in figs 9 and 10 respectively the relationship with yield is the stronger regression fig 10 but that accounts for only 45 of the variance intuitively this is sensible because with the exception of those dams built for flood control water infrastructure planners and engineers plan and design water storage infrastructure on the basis of how much water they can supply or yield not how much they can store and yield is moderately strongly correlated to catchment area r2 0 57 n 200 reservoir capacity is less so r2 0 09 n 213 the final costs of dams per ml storage and per ml yield sampled by reservoir primary purpose and dam type are provided in tables 2 and 3 respectively for hydropower irrigation and water supply table 2 for which there are sufficient reservoirs to allow a comparison the median costs are respectively 1565 472 and 1278 ml of storage and 780 846 and 1616 ml of yield for hydropower dams in australia the median ml of storage is higher than the median ml of yield because the majority of the reservoirs are within year storages of the 98 224 dams examined 8 41 have hydropower listed as their primary purpose of the 8 41 dams approximately 75 80 have a standardised net inflow greater than the coefficient of variation of annual inflow see mcmahon et al 2007 and hence are classified as being within year storages compared to about 35 35 for reservoirs with a primary purpose of irrigation and 40 35 for reservoirs with a primary purpose of water supply relative to the capacity of irrigation reservoirs median capacity of 312 gl n 32 the capacity of hydropower reservoirs is smaller median capacity of 40 gl n 8 furthermore due to the need for high dam walls hydropower dams in australia are mostly located in the mountainous headwater catchments of tasmania 71 of the 41 hydropower dams and the australian alps 22 where the dams are sited on rivers with a lower inter annual variability of streamflow than elsewhere in australia and which continuously replenish the reservoir for longer periods each year which means the yield can be higher than the storage capacity in table 3 the median unit costs of storage of concrete arch dams are tabulated as 2153 ml compared to 1064 ml for earth embankments 977 ml for rock embankments and 624 ml for concrete gravity the median costs per unit yield of earth embankment dams are listed as 1651 ml compared to rock embankments at 1506 ml the median unit cost of concrete gravity dams is approximately half 791 ml interestingly the gradient and intercept of the trend lines for ml yield versus catchment area for all dams ml yield 21008 catchment area 0 437 r2 0 45 are similar for earth embankment rockfill embankment dams and concrete gravity dams fig 10 based on these observations one potential explanation for the low median unit cost of concrete gravity dams relative to earth and rockfill embankment dams is because concrete gravity dams have a larger median catchment area 1287 km2 than earthfill 325 km2 and rockfill 891 km2 embankment dams and as discussed earlier yield is moderately strongly correlated with catchment area concrete gravity dams with a central overflow spillway are generally more suitable for large catchments where a large spillway capacity is required to discharge flood inflows than embankment dams rockfill embankment dams typically have larger catchment areas than earthfill embankment dams because methods have been devised for reinforcing the downstream rockfill slope to protect it from erosion and indeed several rockfill dams in australia have survived overtopping during flood events with minimal damage eagles 2000 the median and mean final costs of dams per unit reservoir storage capacity sampled by the lithology underlying the dam site are presented in table 4 the difference in median and mean values is large 4 2 dam capital cost overruns for 40 dams constructed in australia and over a wide historical period built between 1888 and 2012 estimated cost immediately prior to commencement of construction and final cost were available for these dams the median cost overrun is 49 with the exceedance range being 20 and 131 respectively table 5 the overall range varies from 48 to 825 the mean cost overrun of all 40 dams is 120 sampled by dam type the largest median percentage cost overruns are recorded for earthfill embankment dams from table 5 it is also observed that the median and mean dam cost overruns for sedimentary rock are about 1 6 and 3 2 times respectively the cost overruns in hard rock settings 4 3 other cost related features as expected annual o m costs increase as the capital costs of dams increase as a percentage of capital costs the median annual o m cost is 0 21 with an exceedance range of 0 14 to 0 35 based on data for 33 dams table 1 in most but not all cases organisations provided o m costs based on an average of several years and did not include major upgrades an alternative metric is the o m annual cost divided by the equivalent annual capital cost for the equivalent annual cost we adopted 7 discount rate over a 30 year period for the latter metric the median annual o m cost is 2 6 with a range of 1 7 4 4 5 regression analyses associated with costs and related variables regression analyses were carried out to examine quantitative relationships between dam costs cost overruns annual o m costs and years of construction and a large set of independent variables in total 141 variables 124 primary variables 12 secondary variables and 5 nominal variables distributed as shown in table 6 were used in the analysis an example of a secondary variable is dam cost per unit reservoir capacity ml where the primary variables are dam cost and reservoir capacity a spreadsheet of primary variables are provided in the supplementary material 1 a step wise regression was applied to all data and the variables that were identified were screened for the variance inflation factor vif which pinpoints collinearity in the independent variables o brien 2007 variables with large vifs were progressively eliminated by ordinary least squares ols regression with the objective of accepting a model within the median vif 2 and no independent variables had a vif value 3 some researchers have applied a less restrictive rule see o brien 2007 for comments but in adopting the above criterion we were cognisant of o brien s advice that threshold values of the vif and tolerance need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients we followed this advice by checking that the cross correlation matrices of the independent variables incorporated in the adopted regression model were low 2 adopting the independent variables from item 1 next a box cox b c transformation λ box and cox 1964 with the b c exponent varying from 0 natural logarithmic transformation through 0 5 square root transformation and finally to 1 no transformation was applied to the dependent variable 3 the anderson darling a d statistic anderson and darling 1952 was checked to ensure the residuals were normally distributed at a minimum of 0 05 level of confidence 4 finally the p values of regression coefficients were also scrutinised to ensure the regression coefficients were significantly different from zero at a level of significance of 0 05 also the sign of the regression coefficient was examined to ensure that the dependent variable increased or decreased as would be expected in practice the results of the regression analyses are summarised in table 7 under five variables final dam cost final dam cost per unit volume of storage cost overrun annual o m cost and years of construction equations 1e 2d 3c 4e and 5f are the adopted equations for the five variables respectively it should be noted that models adopted have only a few parameters making it practicable to collect the data needed to make a prediction a short commentary on equations 1a to 1e now follows to explain our approach in finding the probable best final dam cost model equation 1a is the result of a step wise regression that sought to identify which of the independent variables combined through a multi linear regression to estimate final dam cost from a sample size of 83 costs eight so called independent variables were identified by step wise regression vifs varied from 1 2 to 4 4 with a median value of 2 3 hence there is evidence of collinearity a d statistic is 0 965 where p 0 014 i e p is not greater than 0 05 and hence the residuals are not normally distributed the regression coefficients are also checked for significance and are found to be significantly different from zero for reasons of collinearity and non normality the model equation 1a is not acceptable equations 1b and 1c are also step wise regressions but incorporate box cox transformations λ ½ and λ 0 ln cost respectively of the dependent variable cost2016 for collinearity reasons equation 1b is rejected however equation 1c meets our vif a d and regression coefficient criteria and is acceptable equation 1d is a fourth model that we examined here all variables were log10 transformed designated by symbol l and a step wise regression applied to the data overall this model is accepted all the equations were revisited manually using ols regression progressively removing the variables with the highest vif which resulted in accepting the best compromise among r2 adj and vif finally a log10 transformation was applied to the best model in the previous step which is equation 1e and is the acceptable model the above approach was applied to the other four dependent variables results are provided in table 7 the final step in the analysis was to examine the correlation matrix associated with the five acceptable equations the matrices not shown confirm that the effect of collinearity in the adopted equations is small of the 58 correlations examined between the independent variables only one exhibited a correlation of 0 7 two are 0 6 and four 0 5 5 1 regression results equations 1e 2d 3c 4e and 5f shown in table 7 are the result of the regression analysis of 83 sets of data as explained in the preceding paragraphs equation 1e used to estimate the 2016 dam cost including infrastructure exhibits a r2 adj value of 79 5 and a standard error of estimate of 3 1 units 76 56 the two key variables are dam height and reservoir volume which together account for more than 60 of the variance in total cost in equation 2d the same two variables account for most of the variance 71 in the cost per ml volume of reservoir storage annual o m cost relationship is presented as equation 3c in which the o m 2016 equivalent annual cost in logarithmic space is correlated with final capital cost köppen climate class and the coefficient of variation of annual runoff with r2 adj 71 9 and standard error of estimate of 3 1 units 76 56 the key variable is final capital cost which alone accounts for 47 6 of the variance in ln o mcost2016 equation 4e which describes capital cost overrun is specified by years of construction köppen climate class and correlation coefficient of annual runoff with r2 adj 61 1 and standard error of estimate of 0 4284 units 53 35 the most important independent variable is years of construction which accounts for 42 of the variance in ln overrunratio this seems an appropriate cause effect in which the additional cost results from additional years of construction in equation 5f the number of years of construction is related to the year of construction final dam cost the coefficient of variation of annual runoff and median annual radiation all in logarithmic space however year of construction is not a particularly useful independent variable for predictive purposes however when we remove it from the relationship the r2 adj drops from 49 8 to 29 0 as noted below we surmise this time dependent effect results from the impact of world war ii on the year of construction cost of construction is the most important independent variable accounting for 28 8 of the variance in dependent variable the number of years of construction 6 discussion of capital cost overrun of dams of the 40 dams for which pre and post dam cost estimates were available five were within 10 of the final costs three had an underrun of more than 10 and 32 had an overrun of more than 10 the results indicate that estimations of dam costs in australia are systematically biased downwards these findings are in keeping with studies of large infrastructure projects reported elsewhere in the world in fact the mean dam cost overrun 40 dams of 120 calculated in this study is similar to a large international study of mega dam cost overruns reported as 96 by ansar et al 2014 from the literature review cost overruns in large infrastructure projects can result from a wide range of factors three factors length of construction period subsurface geology and optimistic assumptions reported in the literature of particular relevance to cost overruns of large dams are discussed below within the context of the australian results 6 1 length of construction period the regression analysis indicated that construction length was the most important independent variable when capital cost overrun is the dependent variable correlation between cost overrun and project length has also been made previously e g odeck 2003 flyvbjerg et al 2004 ansar et al 2014 although the relationship between capital cost overrun and the number of years of construction for australian dams is less strong than that observed by ansar 2014 there is nevertheless a clear indication of the effect of long construction periods approximately ⅓ of the dams 12 with cost overrun length of time for completion and completion date data n 36 shown in fig 11 have construction periods in excess of 10 years of the 12 with excessive construction periods five spanned world war ii and two began in 1946 when resources were diverted to the war effort or were initially scarce of the 12 dams with cost overrun 100 all were completed during the period 1952 to 1979 fig 12 the influence of construction period on cost overrun is likely to be both a cause and an effect where a cost overrun has occurred because the project has been delayed or because of a technical or industrial issue however it is also likely to be because longer projects are more complex and it becomes difficult to accurately plan many years into the future ansar et al 2014 longer projects also tend to be more exposed to inflationary pressures 6 2 subsurface geology one of the causes of long construction periods and ultimately cost overruns is likely to be subsurface geological complexities with a number of authors e g bacon and bessant jones 1998 world bank 1984 kucukali 2011 highlighting that construction projects with a greater exposure to site related risks such as geological conditions e g tunnelling extensive excavation were more susceptible to cost overruns unfortunately very few post construction reports exist or are publically available to allow investigation of the cause of cost overruns and excessively long construction periods nevertheless by assigning the dams broad geological categories regolith sedimentary and hard rock based on regional scale geological data analysis indicates that dam cost overruns are more prevalent in sedimentary rock than hard rock settings because 40 of dam failures worldwide are estimated to fail due of foundation conditions icold 1973 and with an estimated 20 000 lives lost due to major dam failures during 20th century jansen 1980 the consequences of large dam failure are high hence failure to identify geotechnical deficiencies in the dam foundations during the planning stages requires such problems to be addressed during the construction phase inevitably resulting in cost overruns furthermore addressing unexpected geotechnical problems during the construction phase is often done at a higher expense than if the problems had been identified in the planning stages stapeldon 1984 during earlier times dams failed due to a lack of knowledge on part of the builders but in recent decades it has usually been an error in omission that has led to failure thomas 1976 a number of authors highlight the importance of geotechnical assessments during all stages of a dam project e g stapledon 1984 fell et al 2005 6 3 optimistic assumptions the large unexplained variance in the cost overrun equations after allowing for the effect of significant factors may in part be due to the omission of more appropriate dependent variables alternatively it could be that cost overrun is not well predicted because estimating a final dam cost requires making some assumptions based on subjective information and when proposing a project human nature would tend to result in optimistic assumptions lovallo and kahneman 2003 meyer 2014 sharot 2011 siemiatycki 2015 although each optimistic assumption in isolation may seem plausible in combination with other optimistic assumptions collectively they may be unlikely to occur examples of optimistic assumptions in dam construction could be associated with weather availability of labour or expertise or industrial relations geology socio economic considerations like inflation exchange rates and approvals based on their analysis some authors take this last point a step further and implicate manipulated forecasts as a probable cause for many cost overruns wachs 1990 in concluding a study of 258 transportation infrastructure projects from around the world and over different historical periods flyvbjerg et al 2002 issued a warning to legislators administrators investors and members of the public who value honest numbers that reported cost estimates were often highly and systematically misleading and that they should not trust cost estimates and benefit cost analysis produced by project promoters 7 conclusion costs associated with 98 australian dams and related infrastructure cost overruns annual o m costs and years to completion were collated and subjected to statistical and regression analyses to explore the key metrics and relationships the statistical analysis of a variable is summarised essentially in two metrics the median and the exceedance range here defined as 75 exceedance and 25 exceedance a set of 138 independent variables were available consisting of dam and reservoir characteristics dam site terrain features and catchment and climate attributes all costs are in 2016 aud final dam costs 98 dams range from 17 m to 1277 with a median cost of 86 m in terms of cost per ml of reservoir storage capacity the exceedance range is 393 ml to 2040 ml with a median cost of 981 ml an alternative measure of dam and related infrastructure cost is in terms of cost per ml yield where yield is defined as the 85 annual time based yield based on a daily time step behaviour analysis incorporating evaporation the exceedance range 89 dams is 669 to 2557 per ml yield with a median of 1304 per ml yield as a percentage of capital costs the median annual o m cost is 0 21 with an exceedance range of 0 14 to 0 35 the median annual o m cost divided by the equivalent annual capital cost is 2 6 with a range of 1 7 to 4 4 the range of cost overruns expressed as a percentage of the estimated or contracted cost immediately prior to construction ranged 75 to 25 exceedance from 20 to 131 with the smallest and largest values being respectively 48 and 825 respectively our analysis suggests that the number of years of construction is a major cause of cost overruns and accounts for 42 of the variance in cost overrun expressed as a ratio of the estimated cost in logarithmic space this is likely to be both a cause and an effect where a cost overrun has occurred because the project has been delayed or because of a technical or industrial issue however it is also likely to be because longer projects are more complex and it becomes difficult to accurately plan many years into the future and longer projects tend to be more exposed to inflationary pressures based on the available data dam cost overruns appear to be more prevalent in sedimentary rock than hard rock settings each dependent variable was related through multiple regression to mainly physical and climate attributes associated with the dam and catchment regression models were developed using step wise and ordinary least squares regression testing a box cox transformation or considering all the variables in logarithmic space and adopting the model only if the residuals were normally distributed exhibited little collinearity and the regression coefficients were mainly statistically significant at the 5 level the adopted models are listed in table 7 and show that the multiple correlation coefficients accounting for between 50 and 80 of the variance in the dependent variable final dam cost and cost ml storage were very well modelled with r2 adj equal to 79 for both metrics and standard errors of estimate from 63 to 38 the model for annual o m cost was also satisfactorily modelled with an r2 adj equal to 72 and standard errors of estimate of 51 and 34 dam cost overrun was also satisfactorily modelled with regression accounting for 61 of the variance and standard errors being 53 and 35 the final variable to be regressed the number of years of construction was poorly modelled with r2 adj equal to 50 and standard errors of estimate from 94 to 48 those variables that explain the largest variation in the data are listed information on the

overruns for the australian situation several cost metrics dam costs and related data were collated for 98 dams constructed across australia since 1888 dam costs operation and maintenance o m costs

twentieth century there has been a resurgence of interest in the construction of large dams for energy biswas 2012 zarfl et al 2015 and food production pmc 2015 particularly in developing and emerging economies mcmahon and petheram submitted in australia and particularly in the tropical and sub tropical north of the continent the primary driver for government s interest in large dams is regional economic development in this sparsely populated region pmc 2015 however debate around the costs and benefits of large dams continues some observers point out that no country or region in a tropical or sub tropical climate has ever made significant economic progress without adequately harnessing it s water resources biswas 2012 on the other hand critics of large dams point to the high direct costs of constructing large water infrastructure projects and the unpredictable and difficult to quantify indirect environmental and social costs that may result another criticism of large dams and large infrastructure projects in general is that they often result in large cost overruns e g pickrell 1990 fouracre et al 1990 skamris and flyvbjerg 1996 ansar et al 2014 terrill et al 2016 with a number of authors concluding that estimated values were significantly biased below actual values e g bacon and besant jones 1988 ansar et al 2014 for example in a summary of cost overruns in large infrastructure assets from non australian countries ansar et al 2014 reported the mean cost overruns for construction projects of roads at 20 bridges and tunnels 34 rail 45 mega dams 96 and nuclear power plants 207 odeck and skjeseth 1995 observed that the uncertainties inherent in cost estimates are rarely brought to the attention of decision makers even as a sensitivity analysis information on dam costs and on dam cost overruns are not readily available in australia major restructuring including commercialisation of the water authorities in australia during the past several decades has resulted in the loss of much useful information including infrastructure costs through being mislaid or deliberately disposed of the aim in publishing this paper is to provide an australian perspective on dam costs and dam cost overruns to examine patterns of dam costs and cost overruns and to develop a good predictor of costs and schedule overruns for the australian situation this study essentially about dam costs and related project information was initiated over 40 years ago when data on costs of australian dams were acquired through written correspondence with water authorities and other relevant government agencies around australia those data were supplemented by an additional survey in 2012 in this paper we examine the relationships between dependent variables of dam costs cost overruns and operation and maintenance costs o m and independent variables one difference between this paper and previous cost related papers is that the previous papers mostly in the economic literature have tended to focus almost exclusively on predictive factors related to technology size procurement and country economic performance e g bacon and besant jones 1998 while this paper also explores the influence of a wide range of climate hydrology geology and landscape related factors on water infrastructure project costs and cost overruns in australia building on a preliminary analysis by petheram and mcmahon 2012 we have collated a unique data set that has dam costs and related data along with reservoir features terrain information at the dam site catchment and climate attributes the foci of this paper are the costs capital overrun and annual o m of australian dams and their relationships to dam and reservoir features to at site terrain characteristics and to catchment and climate attributes specifically the objectives of the current paper are to i examine patterns of dam capital cost cost overrun and annual o m costs in australia ii develop regression relationships for predicting dam capital cost cost overrun and annual o m costs and provide guidance on the utility of regionally based regression relationships elsewhere in the world and on which variables are likely to explain the most variance following this introduction the data used in the paper are described in section 2 which is followed by section 3 that provides background information explaining some features of dam development in australia patterns and simple relationships relating to dam costs in units of 2016 aud australian per ml where ml 103 m3 reservoir storage per ml reservoir yield cost overruns and o m costs are discussed in section 4 in section 5 we discuss the development of regression models to estimate dam costs and related variables some conclusions are drawn in section 6 the supplementary material shows a list of symbols table s1 the full expansion of the köppen geiger climate classification abbreviations table s2 and lists the survey questions table s3 there are also four charts showing the relationship between year of completion and i dam height fig s1 ii dam volume fig s2 iii reservoir volume fig s3 and iv reservoir volume divided reservoir surface area fig s4 a spreadsheet of primary variables is also provided in the supplementary material we have adopted the word dam herein to include the dam wall primary and secondary spillways and outlet structures reservoir is reserved for the water body upstream of the dam wall reservoir capacity is used to describe the volume of the water body upstream of the dam wall at the full supply level fsl and dam volume refers to the volume of material e g concrete earth rock within the dam wall in this paper the term cost overrun refers to the percentage difference between the actual cost of a dam and it s publically stated or contracted cost immediately prior to construction for example if a dam was estimated to cost 100 million but actually cost 150 million the cost overrun would be 50 2 data data for the analyses described in this paper were obtained from several sources a major source of information about dam costs and other project information was collected in the mid 1970s this information was acquired through written correspondence to 23 water authorities and other relevant government agencies around australia for 72 dams those cost data were substantially enhanced with the inclusion of data from frecker 1969 9 sites and additional material in 1974 6 sites in 2012 an additional survey was conducted of 53 relevant australian authorities 17 of which provided additional data 46 sites survey questions are provided in table s3 of the supplementary material these data have been collated with data on dam dimensions storage capacity and spillway size which are documented in a database maintained by the australian national committee on large dams ancold ancold 2010 along with dam site terrain data catchment and climate attributes and related hydrologic information that were calculated for each site as part of this analysis the list of non cost variables used in the regression analysis totalling 132 is provided in supplementary table s1 the dam costs were adjusted to 2016 costs in australian s using the australian bureau of statistics abs consumer price index cpi from 1948 to present prior to 1948 we adopted annual inflation rates based on derived relationship between the australian and united states us cpi values australian and us cpi values tracked very similarly from 1948 to the present r2 0 99 where the construction length was 6 years and the annual cost expenditure data were unavailable 17 dams it was assumed for the purposes of applying inflation factors that three quarters of the expenditure occurred in the middle 50 of years of construction and the remaining 25 of expenditure occurred in the first and last 25 of years this assumption was based on analysis from five dams for which annual expenditure data were available an alternative to using cpi for indexing dam construction costs is to use a construction specific index however relevant construction based indices published by the abs namely the australian heavy and civil engineering construction australia and australian road and bridge construction only exist since 2007 and 1997 respectively and consequently could only be applied to less than 5 of the 98 dams with cost data nevertheless the choice of index may be inconsequential for this analysis where costs extend back many decades in an analysis of australian and international indices ghd meyrick 2011 found that over the long term i e decades increases in construction costs have not exceeded general inflation although there were short periods of several years where construction costs exceeded general inflation and vice versa 3 background information from an initial data set of 564 ancold dams and 133 dams for which we had some cost information we considered four data sets first 224 dams with reservoirs 10 gl in capacity for which dam site terrain catchment and climate attributes were accessible second 98 dams of the 224 for which capital cost data were available third 40 dams of the 98 for which cost overrun data were available and fourth 33 dams of the 98 for which annual o m cost data were available table 1 provides a summary of the key data used in these analyses the exceedance range which is defined in this paper as 75 exceedance to 25 exceedance of final dam costs 2016 aud is 51 m to 209 m or in terms of cost per unit reservoir capacity 393 per ml to 2040 per ml annual o m costs 33 dams expressed as a of final dam capital cost varies from 0 14 to 0 35 the exceedance range of cost overruns 40 dams varies from 20 to 131 with the smallest and largest values being respectively 48 and 825 respectively for the 224 dam data set the exceedance range of dam heights is 24 m to 56 m and the range of reservoir volumes is 23 gl to 190 gl the locations of the 224 dams with reservoirs 10 gl in capacity are identified in fig 1 along with the locations of the 98 dams with capital cost data and 40 dams with cost overrun data in fig 2 the cumulative number and cumulative reservoir capacity of the 98 australian reservoirs examined in this study are plotted against year of completion for comparison the cumulative number of dams against year of completion of the larger data set of 224 reservoirs in australia is also shown two other relevant pieces of background information are the purposes of the reservoirs and the types of dam wall the two major purposes of australian reservoirs examined in this analysis of 98 reservoirs are for water supply residential commercial and industrial at 57 and irrigation at 33 and by reservoir capacity 68 is for irrigation and 19 for water supply 8 of reservoirs and 13 of reservoir capacity are used for hydropower dams constructed as rock embankments account for 42 by number and 56 by reservoir capacity earth embankment dams account for 29 by number but 26 by reservoir capacity and concrete gravity dams account for 22 by number and 17 by reservoir capacity 4 dam costs 4 1 dam capital costs in fig 3 the relationship between the final capital costs 2016 aud of dams including spillways and related infrastructure and a dam wall volume and b dam height for different dam types is examined categorising the data by dam type resulted in a considerable improvement in the relationship over that using all dams r2 multiple correlation coefficient of 0 37 when dam cost is related to dam volume fig 3a but not when dam cost is related to dam height fig 3b the relationships between dam cost and dam volume for concrete arch concrete gravity rockfill embankment and earth embankment dams had r2 of 0 69 0 58 0 63 and 0 42 respectively concrete is a more expensive construction material than rockfill which in turn is more expensive than earthfill concrete arch dams when suitably sited require less concrete than an equivalent concrete gravity dam gehin 1961 but require more formwork and of greater complexity and consequently have higher labour requirements these patterns are reflected in fig 3 the relationship between the final costs 2016 aud of dams and reservoir capacity is moderately strong r2 0 53 n 98 n is sample size fig 4 categorising the dams by reservoir primary purpose strengthened the relationship for those dams which are primarily used for irrigation r2 0 77 n 32 but weakened the relationship for dams whose reservoirs primary purpose was hydro power generation r2 0 27 n 8 and water supply r2 0 32 n 56 the wide variation in results of water supply reservoirs is likely because other factors strongly influence the cost effectiveness of a site for example water supply reservoirs are generally sited in close proximity to the demand particularly if the water is to be piped to maintain water of high quality and that site selection may be constrained by urban and industrial development there are likely to be fewer constraints on the siting of reservoirs for which the primary purpose is irrigation dams can be placed at a suitable location at a considerable distance upstream of the proposed irrigation area and water run down the river to the point of extraction consequently it is thought that the strong relationship is more likely to be due to what is considered an acceptable cost for storing a given volume of water for irrigation purposes than the effect of reservoir capacity on dam cost the wide variation in the costs of water supply dams is indicative of the capacity of urban and industrial users to pay a higher price for water and a political willingness to fund water infrastructure to ensure the water security of urban users than for irrigation users this is likely to be the reason for the weak correlation between unit cost and distance from a capital city shown in fig 5 despite higher costs associated with remoteness such as labour expertise and lack of existing infrastructure further categorising those dams whose reservoirs primary purpose is irrigation by dam type not shown slightly improved the r2 of the dam cost to reservoir capacity relationship r2 0 77 n 32 for earthfill embankment dams r2 0 83 n 9 but weakened the relationship for rockfill embankment dams r2 0 71 n 15 and concrete gravity dams r2 0 68 n 6 two important cost metrics are dam cost per unit of reservoir storage capacity and dam cost per unit of reservoir yield both metrics allow comparisons to be made across different reservoir capacities to do this we use ml fig 6 a shows the relationship between dam cost per ml storage 98 dams and reservoir capacity ml is relatively strong r2 0 64 in fig 6a and later plots reservoir yield ml for 85 annual time based reliability was calculated for each reservoir 89 reservoirs using a behaviour analysis with 115 years of modelled daily inflows generated using 0 05 by 0 05 gridded runoff data obtained from petheram et al 2012 and vaze et al 2013 and incorporating morton s lake evaporation mcmahon et al 2013 an explanation of the application of probability analysis to reservoir yield estimation can be found in mcmahon and adeloye 2005 in fig 6a the relationship involving dam cost per ml yield which for practical purposes is more useful than ml of storage is much weaker r2 0 15 than observed between dam cost per ml storage and reservoir capacity r2 0 64 the poor relationship is likely to be because reservoir capacity is not always a good indicator of yield small capacity weirs and dams may be low yielding if sited in small headwater catchments or relatively high yielding if sited on a large river which is continually replenished categorising the dam cost per ml storage capacity data by reservoir primary purpose fig 6b improved the relationship between ml storage and reservoir capacity for irrigation r2 0 72 and hydropower r2 0 77 dams but not water supply dams r2 0 50 in fig 7 final dam cost per unit storage is plotted against reservoir surface area exhibiting a strong relationship of r2 0 67 it also has a small see standard error of estimate of 0 28 log units the next figure explores the relationship between final dam cost per unit storage and the year of completion of construction fig 8 fig 8 suggests that unit costs i e ml storage in the dam construction industry adjusted for inflation have changed little over time this observation is somewhat counter intuitive because the introduction of new and better technology methods and materials had the effect of making dams cheaper for example in the 1950s the introduction of large earth moving equipment reduced the relative cost of embankment dams doherty 2000 chapter 3 and with the introduction of pre stressed concrete gravity dams in the 1960s and particularly with the introduction of roller compacted concrete dams in australia in the 1980s concrete gravity dams became cost effective again despite the high price of concrete doherty 1999 chapter 4 however from fig 8 it would appear that those factors contributing towards making the construction of dams less expensive than previously were overly compensated by factors making them more expensive these are likely to include an increase in the cost of labour an increased consciousness of dam safety doherty 1999 chapter 4 an increase in costs associated with environmental approvals construction health and safety and simply by virtue of the fact that the best dam sites were developed first and that with growth in the australian population sometimes better dam sites have to be discounted because substantial development has occurred in the reservoir footprint the relationships between dam costs per ml of storage and dam costs per ml of yield and catchment area are explored in figs 9 and 10 respectively the relationship with yield is the stronger regression fig 10 but that accounts for only 45 of the variance intuitively this is sensible because with the exception of those dams built for flood control water infrastructure planners and engineers plan and design water storage infrastructure on the basis of how much water they can supply or yield not how much they can store and yield is moderately strongly correlated to catchment area r2 0 57 n 200 reservoir capacity is less so r2 0 09 n 213 the final costs of dams per ml storage and per ml yield sampled by reservoir primary purpose and dam type are provided in tables 2 and 3 respectively for hydropower irrigation and water supply table 2 for which there are sufficient reservoirs to allow a comparison the median costs are respectively 1565 472 and 1278 ml of storage and 780 846 and 1616 ml of yield for hydropower dams in australia the median ml of storage is higher than the median ml of yield because the majority of the reservoirs are within year storages of the 98 224 dams examined 8 41 have hydropower listed as their primary purpose of the 8 41 dams approximately 75 80 have a standardised net inflow greater than the coefficient of variation of annual inflow see mcmahon et al 2007 and hence are classified as being within year storages compared to about 35 35 for reservoirs with a primary purpose of irrigation and 40 35 for reservoirs with a primary purpose of water supply relative to the capacity of irrigation reservoirs median capacity of 312 gl n 32 the capacity of hydropower reservoirs is smaller median capacity of 40 gl n 8 furthermore due to the need for high dam walls hydropower dams in australia are mostly located in the mountainous headwater catchments of tasmania 71 of the 41 hydropower dams and the australian alps 22 where the dams are sited on rivers with a lower inter annual variability of streamflow than elsewhere in australia and which continuously replenish the reservoir for longer periods each year which means the yield can be higher than the storage capacity in table 3 the median unit costs of storage of concrete arch dams are tabulated as 2153 ml compared to 1064 ml for earth embankments 977 ml for rock embankments and 624 ml for concrete gravity the median costs per unit yield of earth embankment dams are listed as 1651 ml compared to rock embankments at 1506 ml the median unit cost of concrete gravity dams is approximately half 791 ml interestingly the gradient and intercept of the trend lines for ml yield versus catchment area for all dams ml yield 21008 catchment area 0 437 r2 0 45 are similar for earth embankment rockfill embankment dams and concrete gravity dams fig 10 based on these observations one potential explanation for the low median unit cost of concrete gravity dams relative to earth and rockfill embankment dams is because concrete gravity dams have a larger median catchment area 1287 km2 than earthfill 325 km2 and rockfill 891 km2 embankment dams and as discussed earlier yield is moderately strongly correlated with catchment area concrete gravity dams with a central overflow spillway are generally more suitable for large catchments where a large spillway capacity is required to discharge flood inflows than embankment dams rockfill embankment dams typically have larger catchment areas than earthfill embankment dams because methods have been devised for reinforcing the downstream rockfill slope to protect it from erosion and indeed several rockfill dams in australia have survived overtopping during flood events with minimal damage eagles 2000 the median and mean final costs of dams per unit reservoir storage capacity sampled by the lithology underlying the dam site are presented in table 4 the difference in median and mean values is large 4 2 dam capital cost overruns for 40 dams constructed in australia and over a wide historical period built between 1888 and 2012 estimated cost immediately prior to commencement of construction and final cost were available for these dams the median cost overrun is 49 with the exceedance range being 20 and 131 respectively table 5 the overall range varies from 48 to 825 the mean cost overrun of all 40 dams is 120 sampled by dam type the largest median percentage cost overruns are recorded for earthfill embankment dams from table 5 it is also observed that the median and mean dam cost overruns for sedimentary rock are about 1 6 and 3 2 times respectively the cost overruns in hard rock settings 4 3 other cost related features as expected annual o m costs increase as the capital costs of dams increase as a percentage of capital costs the median annual o m cost is 0 21 with an exceedance range of 0 14 to 0 35 based on data for 33 dams table 1 in most but not all cases organisations provided o m costs based on an average of several years and did not include major upgrades an alternative metric is the o m annual cost divided by the equivalent annual capital cost for the equivalent annual cost we adopted 7 discount rate over a 30 year period for the latter metric the median annual o m cost is 2 6 with a range of 1 7 4 4 5 regression analyses associated with costs and related variables regression analyses were carried out to examine quantitative relationships between dam costs cost overruns annual o m costs and years of construction and a large set of independent variables in total 141 variables 124 primary variables 12 secondary variables and 5 nominal variables distributed as shown in table 6 were used in the analysis an example of a secondary variable is dam cost per unit reservoir capacity ml where the primary variables are dam cost and reservoir capacity a spreadsheet of primary variables are provided in the supplementary material 1 a step wise regression was applied to all data and the variables that were identified were screened for the variance inflation factor vif which pinpoints collinearity in the independent variables o brien 2007 variables with large vifs were progressively eliminated by ordinary least squares ols regression with the objective of accepting a model within the median vif 2 and no independent variables had a vif value 3 some researchers have applied a less restrictive rule see o brien 2007 for comments but in adopting the above criterion we were cognisant of o brien s advice that threshold values of the vif and tolerance need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients we followed this advice by checking that the cross correlation matrices of the independent variables incorporated in the adopted regression model were low 2 adopting the independent variables from item 1 next a box cox b c transformation λ box and cox 1964 with the b c exponent varying from 0 natural logarithmic transformation through 0 5 square root transformation and finally to 1 no transformation was applied to the dependent variable 3 the anderson darling a d statistic anderson and darling 1952 was checked to ensure the residuals were normally distributed at a minimum of 0 05 level of confidence 4 finally the p values of regression coefficients were also scrutinised to ensure the regression coefficients were significantly different from zero at a level of significance of 0 05 also the sign of the regression coefficient was examined to ensure that the dependent variable increased or decreased as would be expected in practice the results of the regression analyses are summarised in table 7 under five variables final dam cost final dam cost per unit volume of storage cost overrun annual o m cost and years of construction equations 1e 2d 3c 4e and 5f are the adopted equations for the five variables respectively it should be noted that models adopted have only a few parameters making it practicable to collect the data needed to make a prediction a short commentary on equations 1a to 1e now follows to explain our approach in finding the probable best final dam cost model equation 1a is the result of a step wise regression that sought to identify which of the independent variables combined through a multi linear regression to estimate final dam cost from a sample size of 83 costs eight so called independent variables were identified by step wise regression vifs varied from 1 2 to 4 4 with a median value of 2 3 hence there is evidence of collinearity a d statistic is 0 965 where p 0 014 i e p is not greater than 0 05 and hence the residuals are not normally distributed the regression coefficients are also checked for significance and are found to be significantly different from zero for reasons of collinearity and non normality the model equation 1a is not acceptable equations 1b and 1c are also step wise regressions but incorporate box cox transformations λ ½ and λ 0 ln cost respectively of the dependent variable cost2016 for collinearity reasons equation 1b is rejected however equation 1c meets our vif a d and regression coefficient criteria and is acceptable equation 1d is a fourth model that we examined here all variables were log10 transformed designated by symbol l and a step wise regression applied to the data overall this model is accepted all the equations were revisited manually using ols regression progressively removing the variables with the highest vif which resulted in accepting the best compromise among r2 adj and vif finally a log10 transformation was applied to the best model in the previous step which is equation 1e and is the acceptable model the above approach was applied to the other four dependent variables results are provided in table 7 the final step in the analysis was to examine the correlation matrix associated with the five acceptable equations the matrices not shown confirm that the effect of collinearity in the adopted equations is small of the 58 correlations examined between the independent variables only one exhibited a correlation of 0 7 two are 0 6 and four 0 5 5 1 regression results equations 1e 2d 3c 4e and 5f shown in table 7 are the result of the regression analysis of 83 sets of data as explained in the preceding paragraphs equation 1e used to estimate the 2016 dam cost including infrastructure exhibits a r2 adj value of 79 5 and a standard error of estimate of 3 1 units 76 56 the two key variables are dam height and reservoir volume which together account for more than 60 of the variance in total cost in equation 2d the same two variables account for most of the variance 71 in the cost per ml volume of reservoir storage annual o m cost relationship is presented as equation 3c in which the o m 2016 equivalent annual cost in logarithmic space is correlated with final capital cost köppen climate class and the coefficient of variation of annual runoff with r2 adj 71 9 and standard error of estimate of 3 1 units 76 56 the key variable is final capital cost which alone accounts for 47 6 of the variance in ln o mcost2016 equation 4e which describes capital cost overrun is specified by years of construction köppen climate class and correlation coefficient of annual runoff with r2 adj 61 1 and standard error of estimate of 0 4284 units 53 35 the most important independent variable is years of construction which accounts for 42 of the variance in ln overrunratio this seems an appropriate cause effect in which the additional cost results from additional years of construction in equation 5f the number of years of construction is related to the year of construction final dam cost the coefficient of variation of annual runoff and median annual radiation all in logarithmic space however year of construction is not a particularly useful independent variable for predictive purposes however when we remove it from the relationship the r2 adj drops from 49 8 to 29 0 as noted below we surmise this time dependent effect results from the impact of world war ii on the year of construction cost of construction is the most important independent variable accounting for 28 8 of the variance in dependent variable the number of years of construction 6 discussion of capital cost overrun of dams of the 40 dams for which pre and post dam cost estimates were available five were within 10 of the final costs three had an underrun of more than 10 and 32 had an overrun of more than 10 the results indicate that estimations of dam costs in australia are systematically biased downwards these findings are in keeping with studies of large infrastructure projects reported elsewhere in the world in fact the mean dam cost overrun 40 dams of 120 calculated in this study is similar to a large international study of mega dam cost overruns reported as 96 by ansar et al 2014 from the literature review cost overruns in large infrastructure projects can result from a wide range of factors three factors length of construction period subsurface geology and optimistic assumptions reported in the literature of particular relevance to cost overruns of large dams are discussed below within the context of the australian results 6 1 length of construction period the regression analysis indicated that construction length was the most important independent variable when capital cost overrun is the dependent variable correlation between cost overrun and project length has also been made previously e g odeck 2003 flyvbjerg et al 2004 ansar et al 2014 although the relationship between capital cost overrun and the number of years of construction for australian dams is less strong than that observed by ansar 2014 there is nevertheless a clear indication of the effect of long construction periods approximately ⅓ of the dams 12 with cost overrun length of time for completion and completion date data n 36 shown in fig 11 have construction periods in excess of 10 years of the 12 with excessive construction periods five spanned world war ii and two began in 1946 when resources were diverted to the war effort or were initially scarce of the 12 dams with cost overrun 100 all were completed during the period 1952 to 1979 fig 12 the influence of construction period on cost overrun is likely to be both a cause and an effect where a cost overrun has occurred because the project has been delayed or because of a technical or industrial issue however it is also likely to be because longer projects are more complex and it becomes difficult to accurately plan many years into the future ansar et al 2014 longer projects also tend to be more exposed to inflationary pressures 6 2 subsurface geology one of the causes of long construction periods and ultimately cost overruns is likely to be subsurface geological complexities with a number of authors e g bacon and bessant jones 1998 world bank 1984 kucukali 2011 highlighting that construction projects with a greater exposure to site related risks such as geological conditions e g tunnelling extensive excavation were more susceptible to cost overruns unfortunately very few post construction reports exist or are publically available to allow investigation of the cause of cost overruns and excessively long construction periods nevertheless by assigning the dams broad geological categories regolith sedimentary and hard rock based on regional scale geological data analysis indicates that dam cost overruns are more prevalent in sedimentary rock than hard rock settings because 40 of dam failures worldwide are estimated to fail due of foundation conditions icold 1973 and with an estimated 20 000 lives lost due to major dam failures during 20th century jansen 1980 the consequences of large dam failure are high hence failure to identify geotechnical deficiencies in the dam foundations during the planning stages requires such problems to be addressed during the construction phase inevitably resulting in cost overruns furthermore addressing unexpected geotechnical problems during the construction phase is often done at a higher expense than if the problems had been identified in the planning stages stapeldon 1984 during earlier times dams failed due to a lack of knowledge on part of the builders but in recent decades it has usually been an error in omission that has led to failure thomas 1976 a number of authors highlight the importance of geotechnical assessments during all stages of a dam project e g stapledon 1984 fell et al 2005 6 3 optimistic assumptions the large unexplained variance in the cost overrun equations after allowing for the effect of significant factors may in part be due to the omission of more appropriate dependent variables alternatively it could be that cost overrun is not well predicted because estimating a final dam cost requires making some assumptions based on subjective information and when proposing a project human nature would tend to result in optimistic assumptions lovallo and kahneman 2003 meyer 2014 sharot 2011 siemiatycki 2015 although each optimistic assumption in isolation may seem plausible in combination with other optimistic assumptions collectively they may be unlikely to occur examples of optimistic assumptions in dam construction could be associated with weather availability of labour or expertise or industrial relations geology socio economic considerations like inflation exchange rates and approvals based on their analysis some authors take this last point a step further and implicate manipulated forecasts as a probable cause for many cost overruns wachs 1990 in concluding a study of 258 transportation infrastructure projects from around the world and over different historical periods flyvbjerg et al 2002 issued a warning to legislators administrators investors and members of the public who value honest numbers that reported cost estimates were often highly and systematically misleading and that they should not trust cost estimates and benefit cost analysis produced by project promoters 7 conclusion costs associated with 98 australian dams and related infrastructure cost overruns annual o m costs and years to completion were collated and subjected to statistical and regression analyses to explore the key metrics and relationships the statistical analysis of a variable is summarised essentially in two metrics the median and the exceedance range here defined as 75 exceedance and 25 exceedance a set of 138 independent variables were available consisting of dam and reservoir characteristics dam site terrain features and catchment and climate attributes all costs are in 2016 aud final dam costs 98 dams range from 17 m to 1277 with a median cost of 86 m in terms of cost per ml of reservoir storage capacity the exceedance range is 393 ml to 2040 ml with a median cost of 981 ml an alternative measure of dam and related infrastructure cost is in terms of cost per ml yield where yield is defined as the 85 annual time based yield based on a daily time step behaviour analysis incorporating evaporation the exceedance range 89 dams is 669 to 2557 per ml yield with a median of 1304 per ml yield as a percentage of capital costs the median annual o m cost is 0 21 with an exceedance range of 0 14 to 0 35 the median annual o m cost divided by the equivalent annual capital cost is 2 6 with a range of 1 7 to 4 4 the range of cost overruns expressed as a percentage of the estimated or contracted cost immediately prior to construction ranged 75 to 25 exceedance from 20 to 131 with the smallest and largest values being respectively 48 and 825 respectively our analysis suggests that the number of years of construction is a major cause of cost overruns and accounts for 42 of the variance in cost overrun expressed as a ratio of the estimated cost in logarithmic space this is likely to be both a cause and an effect where a cost overrun has occurred because the project has been delayed or because of a technical or industrial issue however it is also likely to be because longer projects are more complex and it becomes difficult to accurately plan many years into the future and longer projects tend to be more exposed to inflationary pressures based on the available data dam cost overruns appear to be more prevalent in sedimentary rock than hard rock settings each dependent variable was related through multiple regression to mainly physical and climate attributes associated with the dam and catchment regression models were developed using step wise and ordinary least squares regression testing a box cox transformation or considering all the variables in logarithmic space and adopting the model only if the residuals were normally distributed exhibited little collinearity and the regression coefficients were mainly statistically significant at the 5 level the adopted models are listed in table 7 and show that the multiple correlation coefficients accounting for between 50 and 80 of the variance in the dependent variable final dam cost and cost ml storage were very well modelled with r2 adj equal to 79 for both metrics and standard errors of estimate from 63 to 38 the model for annual o m cost was also satisfactorily modelled with an r2 adj equal to 72 and standard errors of estimate of 51 and 34 dam cost overrun was also satisfactorily modelled with regression accounting for 61 of the variance and standard errors being 53 and 35 the final variable to be regressed the number of years of construction was poorly modelled with r2 adj equal to 50 and standard errors of estimate from 94 to 48 those variables that explain the largest variation in the data are listed information on the strongest predictor variables presented in this paper may be useful to developers engineers and policy makers elsewhere in the world who may be seeking to develop their own regional dam cost

8614,most studies of the uncertainties in climate change impact assessments focus on each stage independently without considering correlations between stages therefore it is difficult to quantify the relative contribution of each stage to the total uncertainty and to identify how uncertainties are propagated as the stages proceed in this study we propose a new method for decomposing total uncertainty to components from individual stages the proposed method is more theoretically sound compared to existing methods because the sum of the uncertainties from individual stages is always equal to the total uncertainty in addition the results of real data analysis indicate that our proposed method provides reasonable uncertainty decomposition keywords climate change impacts downscaling emission scenario gcm hydrological model total uncertainty uncertainty decomposition 1 introduction climate change has been the most active research area in the area of water resources in the last three decades in climate change impact assessments uncertainty quantification is an important issue because meteorological variables such as precipitation and temperature have to be projected several decades into the future lempert et al 1996 therefore extensive studies have been conducted on climate change and the corresponding uncertainty quantification in water resource research over the last 30 years lettenmaier and gan 1990 beven and binley 1992 kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 nijssen et al 2001 minville et al 2008 bastola et al 2011 nóbrega et al 2011 dobler et al 2012 mandal and simonovic 2017 streamflow projections for water resources typically consist of several stages including emission scenarios general circulation models gcms downscaling techniques and hydrological models moreover in most studies multiple scenarios models or techniques are employed at each stage and different combinations of scenarios models and techniques result in different projected values we call this kind of uncertainty in a streamflow projection due to the choice of models scenarios and techniques the total uncertainty which is thought to be a mixture of uncertainties from different models or scenarios techniques used in multiple stages studies of uncertainty for hydrologic projections have primarily focused on quantifying uncertainty generated from each stage of the climate change impact assessment consisting of either emission scenarios gcms downscaling techniques hydrological models or water resource planning the following is a brief overview of major recent studies minville et al 2008 studied the impact of climate change in the chute du diable watershed quebec canada by comparing statistics on current 1961 1990 and projected future 2020 2050 and 2080 discharge including annual and seasonal mean discharge peak discharge and timing of peak discharge criteria using two emission scenarios five gcms one statistical downscaling technique and one hydrological model they concluded that of all potential sources of uncertainty considered in the study the largest uncertainty was due to the gcm selection bastola et al 2011 attempted to assess the uncertainty in the hydrological impacts of climate change using a multi model approach combining two emission scenarios three gcms six statistical downscaling techniques and four hydrological models to quantify the uncertainty in future impacts in an irish river catchment their results showed that the uncertainties derived from the hydrological models varied between basins emission scenarios and the selected gcm furthermore they concluded that the uncertainty due to the choice of gcms was greater than that due to emission scenarios nóbrega et al 2011 combined resulting mean annual river discharge increases for two periods 2006 2100 and 2040 2069 relative to the baseline 1961 1990 from an ensemble of four emission scenarios six gcms and their gcm structures one rcm and one hydrological model for the rio grande basin they concluded that the most important source of uncertainty in the climate change impacts on the discharge is the gcms rather than the emission scenarios dobler et al 2012 analyzed changes in hydrological variables i e temperature precipitation and runoff between the baseline 1971 2000 and future 2070 2099 to quantify uncertainties with a chained multi model framework of three gcms three rcms three bias correction techniques and 20 sets of hydrological model parameters these results revealed that hydrological projections are subjected to considerable uncertainty their results also confirmed that the gcm structure is an important source of uncertainty mandal and simonovic 2017 analyzed changes in future flow frequency for two different time periods 2036 2065 and 2066 2095 to quantify uncertainties with a multi model framework of three rcp representative concentration pathways emission scenarios four gcms six downscaling techniques and a hydrologic model they concluded that the downscaling techniques were a major contributor to future streamflow change uncertainty when compared to the contributions from gcms and rcp emission scenarios most of these studies however focused on the uncertainty from each stage separately which makes it difficult to compare uncertainties from different stages because the relation between individual uncertainties and the total uncertainty is unclear in addition it is difficult to identify how uncertainty is propagated as stages proceed for example we would like to observe how uncertainties are accumulated as a combination of emission scenarios and gcms compared to uncertainties from emission scenarios alone but studying individual uncertainty cannot answer such questions jones 2000 proposed chains of uncertainty between stages termed as the cascade of uncertainty uncertainty explosion and uncertainty propagation his theory served as the basis for the uncertainty assessment in the ipcc third assessment report ipcc 2001 jones 2000 suggested that uncertainties should be evaluated as a whole more specifically quantitative values of uncertainty gradually increase through all stages as an assessment progresses because all stages in a climate change impact assessment are linked because one stage impacts the following stages all processes have to be considered and assessed in a comprehensive manner consequently the final uncertainty results quantified in the climate change impact assessment should be presented as shown in fig 1 this presentation describes the magnitude of the total uncertainty highlights the stage contributing the most uncertainty and illustrates the uncertainty propagation process in climate change impact assessments however although ipcc 2001 introduced the basic concept of uncertainty propagation relatively few studies have devoted to quantifying uncertainties in a comprehensive manner since the ipcc third assessment report ipcc 2001 one approach for comprehensible uncertainty quantification is based on the statistical framework called analysis of variance anova the anova approach partitions the total variance of projected values into components attributed to the individual sources and the components attributed to interaction or error based on the anova approach yip et al 2011 decomposed the total uncertainty of the surface air temperature projection into uncertainties from natural variability emission scenarios gcms and their interactions using a similar method bosshard et al 2013 decomposed the total uncertainty of streamflow projection into uncertainties from gcms statistical post processing hydrological models and their interactions a disadvantage of the anova approach is that it works well only when the underlying distribution of projected values is gaussian like and hence results are vulnerable to outliers another disadvantage is that it is not easy to interpret how interactions contribute to uncertainty propagation in addition the results depend on the statistical model i e the main effect model versus the model with interactions used for the anova decomposition and it is difficult to justify whether one model is better than others for uncertainty quantification lee et al 2016 proposed a method for comprehensible uncertainty quantification in climate change impact studies using the principle of maximum entropy they illustrated that in analyzing real data of water resource change projection the proposed uncertainty measure reasonably decomposes the total uncertainty into uncertainties from each stage and thus the method provides a unified view of how uncertainty is propagated as each stage of the projection proceeds a limitation of the method of lee et al 2016 is that the sum of the uncertainties from each stage would not equal to the total uncertainty moreover its interpretation would be controversial see section 2 2 for details the purpose of this study is to provide a new method for decomposing total uncertainty into uncertainties from each stage advantages of the proposed method are that 1 it is totally model free and 2 the interpretation of decomposed uncertainty is more transparent such that the sum of uncertainties from each stage is always equal to the total uncertainty this article is organized as follows in section 2 we review the existing methods for quantifying uncertainty propose a new method of decomposing the total uncertainty and prove that the proposed method has desirable theoretical properties in section 3 we provide a statistical interpretation of the proposed method based on the anova framework in section 4 we compare the proposed method with other methods for quantifying uncertainties by analyzing a real data set lastly the conclusions are provided in section 5 2 uncertainty decomposition 2 1 notations suppose there are k many stages for a projection for stage k there are n k models or scenarios techniques denoted by x k for example if the projection procedure consists of two emission scenario five gcms two downscaling models and four hydrological models we have k 4 and n 1 2 n 2 5 n 3 2 and n 4 4 in this set up we have n 1 n 2 n k many projections of an interesting meteorological or hydrological variable e g the average annual precipitation for 2081 2100 for given specific model or scenario technique x k of stage k for k 1 k we let p x 1 x 2 x k be the projected value using the models x k k 1 k for a given set y of real numbers we let u y be a given measure of uncertainty of y examples of an uncertainty measure are range max y y y min y y y variance y y y y 2 y and standard devision y y y y 2 y where y y y y y and y is the number of elements in y a specific choice of the uncertainty measure and its effect to the uncertainty decomposition will be discussed in section 2 4 2 2 review of existing methods in this section we review three existing methods for assessing projection uncertainty the first method which we call the standard method is popularly used in many uncertainty studies kay et al 2009 chen et al 2011 yip et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 the standard method quantifies uncertainty of each stage based on average values of the projection values that use the same model of that stage for a given model or scenario technique x k for stage k the standard method first calculates p x k 1 j 1 j k k n j x 1 x 1 x k 1 x k 1 x k 1 x k 1 x k x k p x 1 x 2 x k which is the average of the projected values which use the model x k at stage k let p k p x k x k x k then the standard method quantifies variation of the set p k by the predefined uncertainty measure u that is the standard method defines the uncertainty of stage k denoted by u st x k as u st x k u p k kay et al 2009 and chen et al 2011 use the range as the uncertainty measure and yip et al 2011 and bosshard et al 2013 use the variance the second method is the one proposed by lee et al 2016 for a given model or scenario technique x k at stage k let p x k be the set of projected values using x k for stage k p x k p x 1 x k 1 x k x k 1 x k x j x j j 1 k 1 k 1 k lee et al 2016 define the uncertainty of the model or scenario technique x k denoted by u lee x k as uncertainty of the set p x k i e u lee x k u p x k then they define the uncertainty of stage k denoted by u lee x k as u lee x k 1 n k x k x k u p x k while the standard method takes the average first and then applies the uncertainty measure lee s method applies the uncertainty measure first and then takes the average the third method is based on the anova decomposition of the projected values yip et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 the anova method assumes that p x μ x x for given x x 1 x k where 1 μ x β 0 β x 1 1 β x k k and x x x 1 x k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance σ 2 here σ 2 can be interpreted as the natural variability or internal variability for the identifiability of the model we let x k x k β x k k 0 we first estimate β x k k x k x k k 1 k by minimizing x x 1 x k p x β 0 β x 1 1 β x k k 2 and quantify the uncertainty of stage k as x k x k β x k k 2 n k note that the anova method implicitly uses the variance as an uncertainty measure there is an interesting relation between these three methods it is easy to show that when the uncertainty measure is the variance the standard method is equivalent to the anova method for lee s method it can be shown that 2 u st x k u total u lee x k when u is the variance where u total denotes the total uncertainty in this case the variance of p x x x 1 x k this is because u p k 1 n k x k x k p x k p 2 1 j 1 k n j x x 1 x k p x k p 2 1 j 1 k n j x x 1 x k p x p 2 1 j 1 k n j x x 1 x k p x p x k 2 1 j 1 k n j x x 1 x k p x p 2 1 n k x k x k u p x k where p the average of all projected values hence u lee x k of lee s method essentially has the same information as that of the standard method and the main effect anova method 1 this equivalence which is noted by a referee implies that the interpretation of lee s method as itself would be misleading lee s method however is not of the main concern in this paper we will not pursue it further 1 motivated by this relation between the standard and lee s method we define the modified lee s method in a way that the uncertainty of stage k is given as u total u lee x k the existing methods are related to the main effect anova model 1 and thus their results would be misleading when there are interactions between models or scenarios techniques from different stages for example consider a simple case where there are only two stages emission scenario and gcm moreover there are two emission scenarios and two gcms denoted by x 1 x 11 x 12 and x 2 x 21 x 22 respectively suppose we have four projected values as p x 11 x 21 0 p x 11 x 22 0 p x 12 x 21 100 and p x 12 x 22 100 then the uncertainty of scenario quantified by the standard method is 0 which totally does not make sense because the final projected values significantly change with respect to the choice of the emission scenario note that the uncertainty of gcm is quite different with respect to the choice of emission scenario when emission scenario is x 11 the projected values corresponding to the two gcm models are equal and hence apparently no uncertainty exists in contrast the projected values from the two gcm models when emission scenario x 12 is used are quite different and thus uncertainty becomes larger that is the uncertainty between gcm models depends on the choice of emission scenario and hence we conclude that there exists an interaction effect between emission scenario and gcm the above example is rather extreme in the sense that the uncertainty of emission scenario for the standard method becomes 0 in general when there are significant interaction effects the uncertainties of each stage quantified based on the main effect anova model would be smaller than they should be since all uncertainties due to the interaction effects are ignored and mingled with the natural variability σ 2 a remedy of this problem would be to use the anova model with higher order interaction effects as is done by bosshard et al 2013 as mentioned in introduction using the anova model has many disadvantages such as sensitivity to outliers difficulty to select the model difficulty to use uncertainty measures other than the variance and so on in addition it would be unclear how to decompose the interaction effects for each stage 2 3 cumulative uncertainty approach the aim of this section is to propose a new method for decomposing the total uncertainty such that the sum of the uncertainties from individual stages is always equal to the total uncertainty for this purpose we propose a novel uncertainty decomposition method called cumulative uncertainty approach which defines the cumulative uncertainty and then decomposes the total uncertainty based on the cumulative uncertainty the cumulative uncertainty approach first defines the cumulative uncertainty up to stage k denoted by u cum x 1 x k intuitively the uncertainty due to the choice of models or scenarios techniques up to stage k can be defined as the variation in projected values due to the model or scenario technique choice up to stage k while the models or scenarios techniques after stage k are fixed for given model or scenarios techniques x k 1 x k after stage k consider the set of projected values q x k 1 x k p x 1 x k x k 1 x k x j x j j 1 k then u q x k 1 x k can be interpreted as the conditional cumulative uncertainty up to stage k while the models or scenarios techniques after stage k are fixed as x k 1 x k then we define the marginal cumulative uncertainty up to stage k as the average of the conditional cumulative uncertainties that is the cumulative uncertainty up to stage k is defined as u cum x 1 x k 1 j k 1 k n j x k 1 x k 1 x k x k u q x k 1 x k as we will prove in the next subsection one of the most interesting properties of cumulative uncertainty is that it keeps increasing as the projection steps progress that is for most reasonable uncertainty measures of u we have u cum x 1 x j u cum x 1 x k for all j k more explicitly as more stages progress more uncertainty is produced in the projection which is a property required by jones jones 2000 since the cumulative uncertainty has an ascending property we can define the uncertainty of each stage as the difference between successive cumulative uncertainties that is the uncertainty of stage k denoted by u cum x k can be defined as u cum x k u cum x 1 x k u cum x 1 x k 1 note that the uncertainty of each stage is an amount of contribution to the cumulative uncertainty also the sum of uncertainties of individual stages is always equal to the total uncertainty u cum x 1 x k 2 4 sufficient conditions for the ascending property of cumulative uncertainty in this section we provide a sufficient condition on the uncertainty measure u for the ascending property of the corresponding cumulative uncertainty and verify that most of popularly used uncertainty measures satisfy that condition the following theorem is the main sufficient condition theorem 1 assume that the uncertainty measure u satisfies the following condition c for any equal sized partition y 1 y m of y i e y i y j for i j j 1 m y j y and y 1 y m 1 m j 1 m u y j u y then the corresponding cumulative uncertainty has the ascending property proof let y q x k 1 x k and y x k q x k x k 1 x k it is easy to verify that y x k x k x k is the equal sized partition of y thus condition c implies 1 n k x k x k u q x k x k 1 x k u q x k 1 x k in turn we have u cum x 1 x k 1 1 j k k n j x k x k x k x k u q x k x k 1 j k 1 k n j x k 1 x k 1 x k x k u q x k 1 x k u cum x 1 x k which completes the proof example suppose a set y y 1 y n is given let y 1 y m be the equal sized partition of y the following uncertainty measures satisfy c range the range is defined as u y max 1 i n y i min 1 i n y i since y j is a subset of y it is evident that u y j u y for any j 1 m and thus 1 m j 1 m u y j 1 m j 1 m u y u y which implies c variance the variance is defined as u y 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 where y 1 n i 1 n y i since y 1 y m is the equal sized partition we have that m y j y for each j and so 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 1 n y i y 1 y i y 2 y i y m y i y 2 1 m 1 y 1 y i y 1 y i y 2 1 y m y i y m y i y 2 1 m 1 y 1 y i y 1 y i y 1 2 1 y m y i y m y i y m 2 where y j 1 y j y i y j y i for j 1 m here the last inequality holds because the squared error is minimized at the mean let g z be a concave nondecreasing function if an uncertainty measure u satisfies the condition c we have 1 m j 1 m g u y j g 1 m j 1 m u y j g u y where the first inequality is due to jensen s inequality and the second inequality is due to the condition c hence g u also satisfies the condition c for example the log of the range which is used by lee et al 2016 and the standard deviation satisfy the condition c therefore the corresponding cumulative uncertainties have the ascending property 3 statistical interpretation of cumulative uncertainty let u y y y y y 2 y be the variance of y suppose that x x 1 x k is a randomly selected index from x 1 x k this is equivalent to assuming that x x 1 x k is a random vector distributed uniformly on x 1 x k consider the conditional variance var p x x k 1 x k 1 x k x k which becomes u q x k 1 x k hence u cum x 1 x k becomes e var p x x k 1 x k the expectation of the conditional variance of p x given x k 1 x k thus the uncertainty of a given stage is an estimate of the difference of the expected conditional variances with and without the information of the model or scenario technique at the stage that is the uncertainty of the stage k is e var p x x k 1 x k e var p x x k x k which is a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty note that var p x x k 1 x k is increasing as k increases and hence u cum x 1 x k is increasing there is an interesting relation between the proposed cumulative uncertainty and anova decomposition suppose that p x μ x x for given x x 1 x k where x x x 1 x k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance σ 2 the variance of p x is given as var μ x σ 2 which is the total variation moreover we have var p x x k x k x k x k var μ x x k x k x k x k σ 2 for all k 1 k consider the main effect model for μ x μ x β 0 β x 1 1 β x k k where β x k k k 1 k are the main effect terms note that the main effect terms are not identifiable with respect to the location shift that is even if we add η k to β x k k for all k and change β 0 to β 0 k 1 k η k the model is not changed to ensure the identifiability of the model we assume x k x k β x k k 0 then we have 3 var μ x x k x k x k x k var β x 1 1 var β x k 1 k 1 hence the proposed uncertainty of the stage k is an estimate of var β x k k for k 2 and var β x 1 1 σ 2 for k 1 the error variance σ 2 can be considered as the natural variability or internal variability however the quantification of σ 2 depends on the selected model and hence not be identified based solely on projected values the uncertainty decomposition 3 of the main effect anova model suggests that the natural variability is mixed with the uncertainty of the first stage in our proposed uncertainty measure and hence we recommend to discount the uncertainty of the first stage based on experts opinions about the natural variability the standard method measures the uncertainty of stage k by 1 n k x k x k p x k p 2 where p is the average of all the projected values this is equivalent to var e p x x k under the main effect anova model var e p x x k var β x k k which is equal to our proposed uncertainty for all stages except the first stage at the first stage our proposed uncertainty is larger than the uncertainty of the standard method by the natural variability i e σ 2 we further consider the anova model with the main and second order interactions where μ x is given as μ x β 0 k 1 k β x k k j 1 k 1 h j 1 k β x j x h j h here β x k k and β x j x h j h are the main and interaction effects respectively we impose the sum to zero identifiability condition x k x k β x k k 0 x j x j β x j x h j h 0 for all x h x h and x h x h β x j x h j h 0 for all x j x j then we have var μ x x k x k x k x k ℓ 1 k 1 var β x ℓ ℓ j 1 k 2 h j 1 k 1 var β x j x h j h j 1 k 1 h k k var β x j x h j h x h x h by the law of total variance i e var y e var y x var e y x for any two random variables x and y and the identifiability condition i e e β x j x h j h x h x h n j 1 x j x j β x j x h j h 0 for all x h x h and h we have that var β x j x h j h e var β x j x h j h x h var e β x j x h j h x h e var β x j x h j h x h and thus e var μ x x k x k x k x k ℓ 1 k 1 var β x ℓ ℓ j 1 k 1 h j 1 k var β x j x h j h hence the uncertainty of stage k of our proposed method becomes var β x k k h k 1 k var β x k x h k h which is the sum of the variation of the main effect of stage k and the variations of the interactions between stage k and stages after k that is we assign the variation of an interaction effect to the uncertainty of the earlier stage in contrast the uncertainty of stage k of the standard method is still the variation of the main effect of stage k due to the sum to zero identifiability condition that is the standard method totally ignores the variations of interaction effects it would be arguable whether assigning the variation of an interaction effect to the earlier stage is reasonable alternatively we could assign the variation of an interaction effect to the later stage or equally to the two involved stages the situation becomes more complicated if there exist higher order interactions we leave the problem of decomposing the variations of interaction effects as a future work we want to emphasize that the proposed cumulative uncertainty approach is model free while the anova approach is model based the obvious advantage of the proposed model free method is that we do not need to specify a priori a statistical model for the behavior of a hydrological variable whose physical system is seldom known moreover we can select the measure of uncertainty u without much restriction in contrast the anova model implicitly requires the use of the variance as the measure of uncertainty and is not easy to be modified for other measures of uncertainty such as the mean absolute deviation or interquartile range that are known to be robust to outliers of course statistical interpretation of our proposed method with such measures of uncertainty needs further investigation 4 case studies 4 1 application overview to compare our method with other methods for quantifying total uncertainty we analyzed streamflow projection data for the upper stream basin of chungju dam which is located in the middle region of korea fig 2 the future projection period is from january 2030 to december 2059 we averaged the monthly projections temporally over 30 years for a final projected value table 1 summarizes the emission scenarios ess gcms statistical downscaling techniques dss and hydrological models hms used in this study for emission scenarios ipcc special report on emissions scenarios sres ipcc 2000 a2 and b1 were used we selected four of the most representative gcms out of nineteen gcms details of the selection procedure are described in lee et al 2016 for downscaling techniques artificial neural network ann hewitson and crane 1992 gardner and dorling 1998 and bilinear regression br kilsby et al 1998 were used to transform the four gcm precipitation and temperature projection time series into three sub watersheds upstream of chungju dam we adopted two hydrological models abcd and the gr2m water balance models which have been widely used in climate change impact assessments wolock and mccabe 1999 wilby and harris 2006 4 2 projection results a total of 32 streamflow projections were generated from the combination of two emission scenarios four gcms two downscaling techniques and two hydrological models fig 3 draws these 32 projected values according to the models or scenarios techniques used in each stage of the projection procedure for example the dots above a2 in the left upper panel of fig 3 are 16 projected values where emission scenario a2 was used and the diamond shape dot is the average of these 16 projected values the dots connected by lines are projected values using the same combination of models or scenario technique except the model at the x axis clearly the gcm stage is the most influential to the projection the four gcm yield fairly different projected values this observation implies that the projected value is highly influenced by the gcm choice in particular the projected values using the gcm csiro is relatively large compared to projected values involving other gcms the existence of such an exceptional model may increase the gcm uncertainty in contrast the choice of hydrological model does not appear to have a significant impact on projected values the two projected values from the same combination of models except the hydrological model are almost identical therefore it would be reasonable to suggest that the gcm uncertainty would be the largest and the hydrological model uncertainty would be the smallest in the next section we will illustrate that our proposed method yields a similar conclusion 4 3 results from uncertainty quantification table 2 summarizes the uncertainty quantification using the standard method with two uncertainty measures range and standard deviation sd the third column of table 2 presents the average projected values involving the corresponding model or scenario technique the range and the standard deviation in averages of projected values of models or scenarios techniques for each stage in the fourth column is computed as the uncertainty for each stage the gcm uncertainty dominates the other uncertainties for both the uncertainty measures for example when we use the range as the uncertainty measure about 76 4 of the total uncertainty is contributed by the gcm if we consider the sum of the uncertainties from individual stages as the total uncertainty this total uncertainty 193 56 m3 s is different from the range of 36 projected values which is 263 53 m3 s the results of the uncertainty quantification using lee s method are presented in table 3 the values in the fourth column are the uncertainties ranges and standard deviations of the corresponding model or scenario technique and the averages of values in the fourth column for each stage are presented in the fifth column as the uncertainty of each stage the sixth column presents the results of the modified lee s method explained in 2 in section 2 2 that is the sixth column presents the modified uncertainty of stage k which is defined as u total u lee x k the results of the original lee s method sharply contrast to those from the standard method for both the uncertainty measures the gcm uncertainty is the smallest and the uncertainties from other stages are much larger than those calculated from the standard method however the results of the modified lee s method is similar to those of the standard method which confirms again our theoretical finding in section 2 2 note that lee et al 2016 used the log of range which is the maximum entropy of the uniform distribution as the uncertainty measure while we use the range itself the problem in using the log of range as the uncertainty measure is that it is not scale invariant that is changing the unit of projected values e g using fahrenheit instead of celsius for a temperature projection will change the ratios of uncertainties between two stages hence relative contribution from each stage to the total uncertainty is sensitive to the unit choice for projected values in contrast using the range as the uncertainty measure does not have this scale problem table 4 presents uncertainty quantification results using our proposed method we consider two uncertainty measures range and standard deviation which have the ascending property as proven in section 2 4 the third column presents the cumulative uncertainties up to the corresponding stage note that the cumulative uncertainty up to the hydrological model stage is equal to the total uncertainty the fourth column presents uncertainties of each stage the percentage in the bracket indicates the proportion of the uncertainty of each stage contributed to the total uncertainty by the ascending property we obtain positive uncertainties for individual stages and we can interpret these as amounts of contribution to the total uncertainty notably the total uncertainty is the same as the uncertainty for the 36 projected values the uncertainty decomposition results using two measures are similar for both cases the largest contributor to the total uncertainty is the gcm stage which represents more than 50 of the total uncertainty the stage representing the second largest uncertainty is different for the two uncertainty measures the downscaling technique stage for the range and emission scenario stage for the standard deviation however the proportional uncertainty for each of these two stages are not significantly different both uncertainty measures indicate that the uncertainty of the hydrological model stage is the smallest the results of the proposed method are similar to those from the standard method even though the contribution from the gcm stage to total uncertainty is smaller in the proposed method 5 concluding remark we proposed a new method for decomposing total uncertainty into uncertainty from each stage the proposed method is more theoretically sound compared to existing methods because the sum of uncertainties for individual stages is always equal to the total uncertainty defined as the uncertainty for all projected values hence we can interpret the percentage uncertainty from each stage compared to the total uncertainty as the contribution of the corresponding stage to the total uncertainty the choice of uncertainty measure u needs special attention as we argued in section 4 3 certain uncertainty measures such as the log of range are not scale invariant and so are inappropriate for uncertainty decomposition guidance for reasonably choosing uncertainty measures would be helpful for each combination of model or scenario technique over multiple stages the projection is usually conducted daily or monthly in this study we took the average of monthly projected values over 30 years this aggregation however may have some information loss there is likely a better way of using information in monthly or daily projected values for uncertainty assessment which we leave for a future work although this study used sres emission scenarios in the ipcc ar4 4th annual report the proposed methodology can be easily applied with the rcp representative concentration pathways emission scenarios in the ipcc ar5 5th annual report the climate change impact assessment studies that incorporate these rcp emission scenarios are currently ongoing in korea acknowledgements

8614,most studies of the uncertainties in climate change impact assessments focus on each stage independently without considering correlations between stages therefore it is difficult to quantify the relative contribution of each stage to the total uncertainty and to identify how uncertainties are propagated as the stages proceed in this study we propose a new method for decomposing total uncertainty to components from individual stages the proposed method is more theoretically sound compared to existing methods because the sum of the uncertainties from individual stages is always equal to the total uncertainty in addition the results of real data analysis indicate that our proposed method provides reasonable uncertainty decomposition keywords climate change impacts downscaling emission scenario gcm hydrological model total uncertainty uncertainty decomposition 1 introduction climate change has been the most active research area in the area of water resources in the last three decades in climate change impact assessments uncertainty quantification is an important issue because meteorological variables such as precipitation and temperature have to be projected several decades into the future lempert et al 1996 therefore extensive studies have been conducted on climate change and the corresponding uncertainty quantification in water resource research over the last 30 years lettenmaier and gan 1990 beven and binley 1992 kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 nijssen et al 2001 minville et al 2008 bastola et al 2011 nóbrega et al 2011 dobler et al 2012 mandal and simonovic 2017 streamflow projections for water resources typically consist of several stages including emission scenarios general circulation models gcms downscaling techniques and hydrological models moreover in most studies multiple scenarios models or techniques are employed at each stage and different combinations of scenarios models and techniques result in different projected values we call this kind of uncertainty in a streamflow projection due to the choice of models scenarios and techniques the total uncertainty which is thought to be a mixture of uncertainties from different models or scenarios techniques used in multiple stages studies of uncertainty for hydrologic projections have primarily focused on quantifying uncertainty generated from each stage of the climate change impact assessment consisting of either emission scenarios gcms downscaling techniques hydrological models or water resource planning the following is a brief overview of major recent studies minville et al 2008 studied the impact of climate change in the chute du diable watershed quebec canada by comparing statistics on current 1961 1990 and projected future 2020 2050 and 2080 discharge including annual and seasonal mean discharge peak discharge and timing of peak discharge criteria using two emission scenarios five gcms one statistical downscaling technique and one hydrological model they concluded that of all potential sources of uncertainty considered in the study the largest uncertainty was due to the gcm selection bastola et al 2011 attempted to assess the uncertainty in the hydrological impacts of climate change using a multi model approach combining two emission scenarios three gcms six statistical downscaling techniques and four hydrological models to quantify the uncertainty in future impacts in an irish river catchment their results showed that the uncertainties derived from the hydrological models varied between basins emission scenarios and the selected gcm furthermore they concluded that the uncertainty due to the choice of gcms was greater than that due to emission scenarios nóbrega et al 2011 combined resulting mean annual river discharge increases for two periods 2006 2100 and 2040 2069 relative to the baseline 1961 1990 from an ensemble of four emission scenarios six gcms and their gcm structures one rcm and one hydrological model for the rio grande basin they concluded that the most important source of uncertainty in the climate change impacts on the discharge is the gcms rather than the emission scenarios dobler et al 2012 analyzed changes in hydrological variables i e temperature precipitation and runoff between the baseline 1971 2000 and future 2070 2099 to quantify uncertainties with a chained multi model framework of three gcms three rcms three bias correction techniques and 20 sets of hydrological model parameters these results revealed that hydrological projections are subjected to considerable uncertainty their results also confirmed that the gcm structure is an important source of uncertainty mandal and simonovic 2017 analyzed changes in future flow frequency for two different time periods 2036 2065 and 2066 2095 to quantify uncertainties with a multi model framework of three rcp representative concentration pathways emission scenarios four gcms six downscaling techniques and a hydrologic model they concluded that the downscaling techniques were a major contributor to future streamflow change uncertainty when compared to the contributions from gcms and rcp emission scenarios most of these studies however focused on the uncertainty from each stage separately which makes it difficult to compare uncertainties from different stages because the relation between individual uncertainties and the total uncertainty is unclear in addition it is difficult to identify how uncertainty is propagated as stages proceed for example we would like to observe how uncertainties are accumulated as a combination of emission scenarios and gcms compared to uncertainties from emission scenarios alone but studying individual uncertainty cannot answer such questions jones 2000 proposed chains of uncertainty between stages termed as the cascade of uncertainty uncertainty explosion and uncertainty propagation his theory served as the basis for the uncertainty assessment in the ipcc third assessment report ipcc 2001 jones 2000 suggested that uncertainties should be evaluated as a whole more specifically quantitative values of uncertainty gradually increase through all stages as an assessment progresses because all stages in a climate change impact assessment are linked because one stage impacts the following stages all processes have to be considered and assessed in a comprehensive manner consequently the final uncertainty results quantified in the climate change impact assessment should be presented as shown in fig 1 this presentation describes the magnitude of the total uncertainty highlights the stage contributing the most uncertainty and illustrates the uncertainty propagation process in climate change impact assessments however although ipcc 2001 introduced the basic concept of uncertainty propagation relatively few studies have devoted to quantifying uncertainties in a comprehensive manner since the ipcc third assessment report ipcc 2001 one approach for comprehensible uncertainty quantification is based on the statistical framework called analysis of variance anova the anova approach partitions the total variance of projected values into components attributed to the individual sources and the components attributed to interaction or error based on the anova approach yip et al 2011 decomposed the total uncertainty of the surface air temperature projection into uncertainties from natural variability emission scenarios gcms and their interactions using a similar method bosshard et al 2013 decomposed the total uncertainty of streamflow projection into uncertainties from gcms statistical post processing hydrological models and their interactions a disadvantage of the anova approach is that it works well only when the underlying distribution of projected values is gaussian like and hence results are vulnerable to outliers another disadvantage is that it is not easy to interpret how interactions contribute to uncertainty propagation in addition the results depend on the statistical model i e the main effect model versus the model with interactions used for the anova decomposition and it is difficult to justify whether one model is better than others for uncertainty quantification lee et al 2016 proposed a method for comprehensible uncertainty quantification in climate change impact studies using the principle of maximum entropy they illustrated that in analyzing real data of water resource change projection the proposed uncertainty measure reasonably decomposes the total uncertainty into uncertainties from each stage and thus the method provides a unified view of how uncertainty is propagated as each stage of the projection proceeds a limitation of the method of lee et al 2016 is that the sum of the uncertainties from each stage would not equal to the total uncertainty moreover its interpretation would be controversial see section 2 2 for details the purpose of this study is to provide a new method for decomposing total uncertainty into uncertainties from each stage advantages of the proposed method are that 1 it is totally model free and 2 the interpretation of decomposed uncertainty is more transparent such that the sum of uncertainties from each stage is always equal to the total uncertainty this article is organized as follows in section 2 we review the existing methods for quantifying uncertainty propose a new method of decomposing the total uncertainty and prove that the proposed method has desirable theoretical properties in section 3 we provide a statistical interpretation of the proposed method based on the anova framework in section 4 we compare the proposed method with other methods for quantifying uncertainties by analyzing a real data set lastly the conclusions are provided in section 5 2 uncertainty decomposition 2 1 notations suppose there are k many stages for a projection for stage k there are n k models or scenarios techniques denoted by x k for example if the projection procedure consists of two emission scenario five gcms two downscaling models and four hydrological models we have k 4 and n 1 2 n 2 5 n 3 2 and n 4 4 in this set up we have n 1 n 2 n k many projections of an interesting meteorological or hydrological variable e g the average annual precipitation for 2081 2100 for given specific model or scenario technique x k of stage k for k 1 k we let p x 1 x 2 x k be the projected value using the models x k k 1 k for a given set y of real numbers we let u y be a given measure of uncertainty of y examples of an uncertainty measure are range max y y y min y y y variance y y y y 2 y and standard devision y y y y 2 y where y y y y y and y is the number of elements in y a specific choice of the uncertainty measure and its effect to the uncertainty decomposition will be discussed in section 2 4 2 2 review of existing methods in this section we review three existing methods for assessing projection uncertainty the first method which we call the standard method is popularly used in many uncertainty studies kay et al 2009 chen et al 2011 yip et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 the standard method quantifies uncertainty of each stage based on average values of the projection values that use the same model of that stage for a given model or scenario technique x k for stage k the standard method first calculates p x k 1 j 1 j k k n j x 1 x 1 x k 1 x k 1 x k 1 x k 1 x k x k p x 1 x 2 x k which is the average of the projected values which use the model x k at stage k let p k p x k x k x k then the standard method quantifies variation of the set p k by the predefined uncertainty measure u that is the standard method defines the uncertainty of stage k denoted by u st x k as u st x k u p k kay et al 2009 and chen et al 2011 use the range as the uncertainty measure and yip et al 2011 and bosshard et al 2013 use the variance the second method is the one proposed by lee et al 2016 for a given model or scenario technique x k at stage k let p x k be the set of projected values using x k for stage k p x k p x 1 x k 1 x k x k 1 x k x j x j j 1 k 1 k 1 k lee et al 2016 define the uncertainty of the model or scenario technique x k denoted by u lee x k as uncertainty of the set p x k i e u lee x k u p x k then they define the uncertainty of stage k denoted by u lee x k as u lee x k 1 n k x k x k u p x k while the standard method takes the average first and then applies the uncertainty measure lee s method applies the uncertainty measure first and then takes the average the third method is based on the anova decomposition of the projected values yip et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 the anova method assumes that p x μ x x for given x x 1 x k where 1 μ x β 0 β x 1 1 β x k k and x x x 1 x k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance σ 2 here σ 2 can be interpreted as the natural variability or internal variability for the identifiability of the model we let x k x k β x k k 0 we first estimate β x k k x k x k k 1 k by minimizing x x 1 x k p x β 0 β x 1 1 β x k k 2 and quantify the uncertainty of stage k as x k x k β x k k 2 n k note that the anova method implicitly uses the variance as an uncertainty measure there is an interesting relation between these three methods it is easy to show that when the uncertainty measure is the variance the standard method is equivalent to the anova method for lee s method it can be shown that 2 u st x k u total u lee x k when u is the variance where u total denotes the total uncertainty in this case the variance of p x x x 1 x k this is because u p k 1 n k x k x k p x k p 2 1 j 1 k n j x x 1 x k p x k p 2 1 j 1 k n j x x 1 x k p x p 2 1 j 1 k n j x x 1 x k p x p x k 2 1 j 1 k n j x x 1 x k p x p 2 1 n k x k x k u p x k where p the average of all projected values hence u lee x k of lee s method essentially has the same information as that of the standard method and the main effect anova method 1 this equivalence which is noted by a referee implies that the interpretation of lee s method as itself would be misleading lee s method however is not of the main concern in this paper we will not pursue it further 1 motivated by this relation between the standard and lee s method we define the modified lee s method in a way that the uncertainty of stage k is given as u total u lee x k the existing methods are related to the main effect anova model 1 and thus their results would be misleading when there are interactions between models or scenarios techniques from different stages for example consider a simple case where there are only two stages emission scenario and gcm moreover there are two emission scenarios and two gcms denoted by x 1 x 11 x 12 and x 2 x 21 x 22 respectively suppose we have four projected values as p x 11 x 21 0 p x 11 x 22 0 p x 12 x 21 100 and p x 12 x 22 100 then the uncertainty of scenario quantified by the standard method is 0 which totally does not make sense because the final projected values significantly change with respect to the choice of the emission scenario note that the uncertainty of gcm is quite different with respect to the choice of emission scenario when emission scenario is x 11 the projected values corresponding to the two gcm models are equal and hence apparently no uncertainty exists in contrast the projected values from the two gcm models when emission scenario x 12 is used are quite different and thus uncertainty becomes larger that is the uncertainty between gcm models depends on the choice of emission scenario and hence we conclude that there exists an interaction effect between emission scenario and gcm the above example is rather extreme in the sense that the uncertainty of emission scenario for the standard method becomes 0 in general when there are significant interaction effects the uncertainties of each stage quantified based on the main effect anova model would be smaller than they should be since all uncertainties due to the interaction effects are ignored and mingled with the natural variability σ 2 a remedy of this problem would be to use the anova model with higher order interaction effects as is done by bosshard et al 2013 as mentioned in introduction using the anova model has many disadvantages such as sensitivity to outliers difficulty to select the model difficulty to use uncertainty measures other than the variance and so on in addition it would be unclear how to decompose the interaction effects for each stage 2 3 cumulative uncertainty approach the aim of this section is to propose a new method for decomposing the total uncertainty such that the sum of the uncertainties from individual stages is always equal to the total uncertainty for this purpose we propose a novel uncertainty decomposition method called cumulative uncertainty approach which defines the cumulative uncertainty and then decomposes the total uncertainty based on the cumulative uncertainty the cumulative uncertainty approach first defines the cumulative uncertainty up to stage k denoted by u cum x 1 x k intuitively the uncertainty due to the choice of models or scenarios techniques up to stage k can be defined as the variation in projected values due to the model or scenario technique choice up to stage k while the models or scenarios techniques after stage k are fixed for given model or scenarios techniques x k 1 x k after stage k consider the set of projected values q x k 1 x k p x 1 x k x k 1 x k x j x j j 1 k then u q x k 1 x k can be interpreted as the conditional cumulative uncertainty up to stage k while the models or scenarios techniques after stage k are fixed as x k 1 x k then we define the marginal cumulative uncertainty up to stage k as the average of the conditional cumulative uncertainties that is the cumulative uncertainty up to stage k is defined as u cum x 1 x k 1 j k 1 k n j x k 1 x k 1 x k x k u q x k 1 x k as we will prove in the next subsection one of the most interesting properties of cumulative uncertainty is that it keeps increasing as the projection steps progress that is for most reasonable uncertainty measures of u we have u cum x 1 x j u cum x 1 x k for all j k more explicitly as more stages progress more uncertainty is produced in the projection which is a property required by jones jones 2000 since the cumulative uncertainty has an ascending property we can define the uncertainty of each stage as the difference between successive cumulative uncertainties that is the uncertainty of stage k denoted by u cum x k can be defined as u cum x k u cum x 1 x k u cum x 1 x k 1 note that the uncertainty of each stage is an amount of contribution to the cumulative uncertainty also the sum of uncertainties of individual stages is always equal to the total uncertainty u cum x 1 x k 2 4 sufficient conditions for the ascending property of cumulative uncertainty in this section we provide a sufficient condition on the uncertainty measure u for the ascending property of the corresponding cumulative uncertainty and verify that most of popularly used uncertainty measures satisfy that condition the following theorem is the main sufficient condition theorem 1 assume that the uncertainty measure u satisfies the following condition c for any equal sized partition y 1 y m of y i e y i y j for i j j 1 m y j y and y 1 y m 1 m j 1 m u y j u y then the corresponding cumulative uncertainty has the ascending property proof let y q x k 1 x k and y x k q x k x k 1 x k it is easy to verify that y x k x k x k is the equal sized partition of y thus condition c implies 1 n k x k x k u q x k x k 1 x k u q x k 1 x k in turn we have u cum x 1 x k 1 1 j k k n j x k x k x k x k u q x k x k 1 j k 1 k n j x k 1 x k 1 x k x k u q x k 1 x k u cum x 1 x k which completes the proof example suppose a set y y 1 y n is given let y 1 y m be the equal sized partition of y the following uncertainty measures satisfy c range the range is defined as u y max 1 i n y i min 1 i n y i since y j is a subset of y it is evident that u y j u y for any j 1 m and thus 1 m j 1 m u y j 1 m j 1 m u y u y which implies c variance the variance is defined as u y 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 where y 1 n i 1 n y i since y 1 y m is the equal sized partition we have that m y j y for each j and so 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 1 n y i y 1 y i y 2 y i y m y i y 2 1 m 1 y 1 y i y 1 y i y 2 1 y m y i y m y i y 2 1 m 1 y 1 y i y 1 y i y 1 2 1 y m y i y m y i y m 2 where y j 1 y j y i y j y i for j 1 m here the last inequality holds because the squared error is minimized at the mean let g z be a concave nondecreasing function if an uncertainty measure u satisfies the condition c we have 1 m j 1 m g u y j g 1 m j 1 m u y j g u y where the first inequality is due to jensen s inequality and the second inequality is due to the condition c hence g u also satisfies the condition c for example the log of the range which is used by lee et al 2016 and the standard deviation satisfy the condition c therefore the corresponding cumulative uncertainties have the ascending property 3 statistical interpretation of cumulative uncertainty let u y y y y y 2 y be the variance of y suppose that x x 1 x k is a randomly selected index from x 1 x k this is equivalent to assuming that x x 1 x k is a random vector distributed uniformly on x 1 x k consider the conditional variance var p x x k 1 x k 1 x k x k which becomes u q x k 1 x k hence u cum x 1 x k becomes e var p x x k 1 x k the expectation of the conditional variance of p x given x k 1 x k thus the uncertainty of a given stage is an estimate of the difference of the expected conditional variances with and without the information of the model or scenario technique at the stage that is the uncertainty of the stage k is e var p x x k 1 x k e var p x x k x k which is a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty note that var p x x k 1 x k is increasing as k increases and hence u cum x 1 x k is increasing there is an interesting relation between the proposed cumulative uncertainty and anova decomposition suppose that p x μ x x for given x x 1 x k where x x x 1 x k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance σ 2 the variance of p x is given as var μ x σ 2 which is the total variation moreover we have var p x x k x k x k x k var μ x x k x k x k x k σ 2 for all k 1 k consider the main effect model for μ x μ x β 0 β x 1 1 β x k k where β x k k k 1 k are the main effect terms note that the main effect terms are not identifiable with respect to the location shift that is even if we add η k to β x k k for all k and change β 0 to β 0 k 1 k η k the model is not changed to ensure the identifiability of the model we assume x k x k β x k k 0 then we have 3 var μ x x k x k x k x k var β x 1 1 var β x k 1 k 1 hence the proposed uncertainty of the stage k is an estimate of var β x k k for k 2 and var β x 1 1 σ 2 for k 1 the error variance σ 2 can be considered as the natural variability or internal variability however the quantification of σ 2 depends on the selected model and hence not be identified based solely on projected values the uncertainty decomposition 3 of the main effect anova model suggests that the natural variability is mixed with the uncertainty of the first stage in our proposed uncertainty measure and hence we recommend to discount the uncertainty of the first stage based on experts opinions about the natural variability the standard method measures the uncertainty of stage k by 1 n k x k x k p x k p 2 where p is the average of all the projected values this is equivalent to var e p x x k under the main effect anova model var e p x x k var β x k k which is equal to our proposed uncertainty for all stages except the first stage at the first stage our proposed uncertainty is larger than the uncertainty of the standard method by the natural variability i e σ 2 we further consider the anova model with the main and second order interactions where μ x is given as μ x β 0 k 1 k β x k k j 1 k 1 h j 1 k β x j x h j h here β x k k and β x j x h j h are the main and interaction effects respectively we impose the sum to zero identifiability condition x k x k β x k k 0 x j x j β x j x h j h 0 for all x h x h and x h x h β x j x h j h 0 for all x j x j then we have var μ x x k x k x k x k ℓ 1 k 1 var β x ℓ ℓ j 1 k 2 h j 1 k 1 var β x j x h j h j 1 k 1 h k k var β x j x h j h x h x h by the law of total variance i e var y e var y x var e y x for any two random variables x and y and the identifiability condition i e e β x j x h j h x h x h n j 1 x j x j β x j x h j h 0 for all x h x h and h we have that var β x j x h j h e var β x j x h j h x h var e β x j x h j h x h e var β x j x h j h x h and thus e var μ x x k x k x k x k ℓ 1 k 1 var β x ℓ ℓ j 1 k 1 h j 1 k var β x j x h j h hence the uncertainty of stage k of our proposed method becomes var β x k k h k 1 k var β x k x h k h which is the sum of the variation of the main effect of stage k and the variations of the interactions between stage k and stages after k that is we assign the variation of an interaction effect to the uncertainty of the earlier stage in contrast the uncertainty of stage k of the standard method is still the variation of the main effect of stage k due to the sum to zero identifiability condition that is the standard method totally ignores the variations of interaction effects it would be arguable whether assigning the variation of an interaction effect to the earlier stage is reasonable alternatively we could assign the variation of an interaction effect to the later stage or equally to the two involved stages the situation becomes more complicated if there exist higher order interactions we leave the problem of decomposing the variations of interaction effects as a future work we want to emphasize that the proposed cumulative uncertainty approach is model free while the anova approach is model based the obvious advantage of the proposed model free method is that we do not need to specify a priori a statistical model for the behavior of a hydrological variable whose physical system is seldom known moreover we can select the measure of uncertainty u without much restriction in contrast the anova model implicitly requires the use of the variance as the measure of uncertainty and is not easy to be modified for other measures of uncertainty such as the mean absolute deviation or interquartile range that are known to be robust to outliers of course statistical interpretation of our proposed method with such measures of uncertainty needs further investigation 4 case studies 4 1 application overview to compare our method with other methods for quantifying total uncertainty we analyzed streamflow projection data for the upper stream basin of chungju dam which is located in the middle region of korea fig 2 the future projection period is from january 2030 to december 2059 we averaged the monthly projections temporally over 30 years for a final projected value table 1 summarizes the emission scenarios ess gcms statistical downscaling techniques dss and hydrological models hms used in this study for emission scenarios ipcc special report on emissions scenarios sres ipcc 2000 a2 and b1 were used we selected four of the most representative gcms out of nineteen gcms details of the selection procedure are described in lee et al 2016 for downscaling techniques artificial neural network ann hewitson and crane 1992 gardner and dorling 1998 and bilinear regression br kilsby et al 1998 were used to transform the four gcm precipitation and temperature projection time series into three sub watersheds upstream of chungju dam we adopted two hydrological models abcd and the gr2m water balance models which have been widely used in climate change impact assessments wolock and mccabe 1999 wilby and harris 2006 4 2 projection results a total of 32 streamflow projections were generated from the combination of two emission scenarios four gcms two downscaling techniques and two hydrological models fig 3 draws these 32 projected values according to the models or scenarios techniques used in each stage of the projection procedure for example the dots above a2 in the left upper panel of fig 3 are 16 projected values where emission scenario a2 was used and the diamond shape dot is the average of these 16 projected values the dots connected by lines are projected values using the same combination of models or scenario technique except the model at the x axis clearly the gcm stage is the most influential to the projection the four gcm yield fairly different projected values this observation implies that the projected value is highly influenced by the gcm choice in particular the projected values using the gcm csiro is relatively large compared to projected values involving other gcms the existence of such an exceptional model may increase the gcm uncertainty in contrast the choice of hydrological model does not appear to have a significant impact on projected values the two projected values from the same combination of models except the hydrological model are almost identical therefore it would be reasonable to suggest that the gcm uncertainty would be the largest and the hydrological model uncertainty would be the smallest in the next section we will illustrate that our proposed method yields a similar conclusion 4 3 results from uncertainty quantification table 2 summarizes the uncertainty quantification using the standard method with two uncertainty measures range and standard deviation sd the third column of table 2 presents the average projected values involving the corresponding model or scenario technique the range and the standard deviation in averages of projected values of models or scenarios techniques for each stage in the fourth column is computed as the uncertainty for each stage the gcm uncertainty dominates the other uncertainties for both the uncertainty measures for example when we use the range as the uncertainty measure about 76 4 of the total uncertainty is contributed by the gcm if we consider the sum of the uncertainties from individual stages as the total uncertainty this total uncertainty 193 56 m3 s is different from the range of 36 projected values which is 263 53 m3 s the results of the uncertainty quantification using lee s method are presented in table 3 the values in the fourth column are the uncertainties ranges and standard deviations of the corresponding model or scenario technique and the averages of values in the fourth column for each stage are presented in the fifth column as the uncertainty of each stage the sixth column presents the results of the modified lee s method explained in 2 in section 2 2 that is the sixth column presents the modified uncertainty of stage k which is defined as u total u lee x k the results of the original lee s method sharply contrast to those from the standard method for both the uncertainty measures the gcm uncertainty is the smallest and the uncertainties from other stages are much larger than those calculated from the standard method however the results of the modified lee s method is similar to those of the standard method which confirms again our theoretical finding in section 2 2 note that lee et al 2016 used the log of range which is the maximum entropy of the uniform distribution as the uncertainty measure while we use the range itself the problem in using the log of range as the uncertainty measure is that it is not scale invariant that is changing the unit of projected values e g using fahrenheit instead of celsius for a temperature projection will change the ratios of uncertainties between two stages hence relative contribution from each stage to the total uncertainty is sensitive to the unit choice for projected values in contrast using the range as the uncertainty measure does not have this scale problem table 4 presents uncertainty quantification results using our proposed method we consider two uncertainty measures range and standard deviation which have the ascending property as proven in section 2 4 the third column presents the cumulative uncertainties up to the corresponding stage note that the cumulative uncertainty up to the hydrological model stage is equal to the total uncertainty the fourth column presents uncertainties of each stage the percentage in the bracket indicates the proportion of the uncertainty of each stage contributed to the total uncertainty by the ascending property we obtain positive uncertainties for individual stages and we can interpret these as amounts of contribution to the total uncertainty notably the total uncertainty is the same as the uncertainty for the 36 projected values the uncertainty decomposition results using two measures are similar for both cases the largest contributor to the total uncertainty is the gcm stage which represents more than 50 of the total uncertainty the stage representing the second largest uncertainty is different for the two uncertainty measures the downscaling technique stage for the range and emission scenario stage for the standard deviation however the proportional uncertainty for each of these two stages are not significantly different both uncertainty measures indicate that the uncertainty of the hydrological model stage is the smallest the results of the proposed method are similar to those from the standard method even though the contribution from the gcm stage to total uncertainty is smaller in the proposed method 5 concluding remark we proposed a new method for decomposing total uncertainty into uncertainty from each stage the proposed method is more theoretically sound compared to existing methods because the sum of uncertainties for individual stages is always equal to the total uncertainty defined as the uncertainty for all projected values hence we can interpret the percentage uncertainty from each stage compared to the total uncertainty as the contribution of the corresponding stage to the total uncertainty the choice of uncertainty measure u needs special attention as we argued in section 4 3 certain uncertainty measures such as the log of range are not scale invariant and so are inappropriate for uncertainty decomposition guidance for reasonably choosing uncertainty measures would be helpful for each combination of model or scenario technique over multiple stages the projection is usually conducted daily or monthly in this study we took the average of monthly projected values over 30 years this aggregation however may have some information loss there is likely a better way of using information in monthly or daily projected values for uncertainty assessment which we leave for a future work although this study used sres emission scenarios in the ipcc ar4 4th annual report the proposed methodology can be easily applied with the rcp representative concentration pathways emission scenarios in the ipcc ar5 5th annual report the climate change impact assessment studies that incorporate these rcp emission scenarios are currently ongoing in korea acknowledgements
