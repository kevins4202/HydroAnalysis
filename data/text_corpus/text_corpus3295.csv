16475,there are some uncertainties of using chlorophyll a chla concentrations in water surface to address phytoplankton dynamics especially in large shallow lakes because of the dramatic vertical migration of phytoplankton the column integrated algal biomass cab can reflect the whole water column information so it is considered as a better indicator for phytoplankton total biomass an algal biomass index abi and an empirical algorithm were proposed previously to measure algal biomass inside and outside euphotic zone from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis data a long term cab time series was generated in this study to clarify the temporal and spatial changes in phytoplankton and address its sensitivity to climatic factors in lake chaohu a shallow eutrophic lake in china from 2000 to 2018 overall the cab for lake chaohu showed significant temporal and spatial dynamics temporally the annual average cab total cba within the whole lake was increased at rate of 0 569 t chla y ranging from 62 06 8 89 t chla to 76 03 10 01 t chla during the 19 year period seasonal and periodic variations in total cab presented a bimodal annual cycle every year the total cab was highest in summer followed by that in autumn and it was the lowest in winter the pixel based cab total cab of a unit water column ranging from 112 42 to 166 85 mg chla was the highest in the western segment especially its northern part and was the lowest in the central parts of eastern and central segments the sensitivity of cab dynamics to climatic conditions was found to vary by region and time scale specifically the change of pixel based algal biomass was more sensitive to the temperature change on the monthly and annual scales while wind speed impacted directly on the short term spatial temporal redistribution of algal biomass high temperature and low wind speed could prompt the growth of total cab for the whole lake and the hydrodynamic situations affected by wind and so on determined the spatial details it also indicated that lake chaohu may face more severe challenges with the future climatic warming this study may serve as a reference to support algal bloom forecasting and early warning management for other large eutrophic lakes with similar problems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords total algal biomass phytoplankton climatic change modis eutrophic lakes 1 introduction lakes around the world are suffering from phytoplankton blooms especially under the climate warming and increasing eutrophication such as lake taihu qin et al 2015 lake chaohu zhang et al 2016a and lake dianchi shan et al 2019 in china lake kasumiguara in japan oyama et al 2015 lake erie in north american scavia et al 2019 and lake victoria in africa nyamweya et al 2020 phytoplankton blooms can pose a serious threat to water quality and aquatic ecosystems ho et al 2019 certain species of phytoplankton float and accumulate on the water surface thus weakening the underwater light environment and depressing underwater macrophytes qin et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 as the result of the microbial degradation of senescent blooms oxygen depletion may induce hypoxia and anoxia causing the death of fish and benthic invertebrates paerl and paul 2012 pal et al 2020 moreover some species of phytoplankton e g cyanobacteria are widely known to produce a variety of cyanotoxins that cause hepatic digestive and neurological diseases when ingested by birds mammals and human otten et al 2012 posing a serious threat to irrigation and drinking water supplies shi et al 2015 it is crucial to accurately monitor phytoplankton bloom dynamics and identify the controlling environmental drivers for phytoplankton bloom management treatment and forecasting ship based sampling approach combined with laboratory analysis is a traditional way to quantitatively assess surface phytoplankton biomass qin et al 2015 similarly by which phytoplankton biomass in water column can be evaluated layer by layer however due to the complexity and costs of in situ measurements it is quite difficult to generalize the laboratory findings on large spatial and temporal scales jutla et al 2012 li and he 2014 given the spatial and temporal advantages remote sensing technology has often been used to estimate the optical properties lee et al 2002 determine key optically active constituents odermatt et al 2012 and detect the extent and frequency of phytoplankton blooms duan et al 2009 shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b till now bloom area hu 2009 and pigment concentration i e chlorophyll a chla or phycocyanin duan et al 2012 kutser et al 2006 matthews et al 2012 qi et al 2014 on water surface are the widely used proxies for remote monitoring of phytoplankton biomass several recent studies have applied long term remotely sensed data to estimate the response of phytoplankton bloom dynamics to environmental variables based on these two proxies for example duan duan et al 2009 and zhang zhang et al 2012 used moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis derived phytoplankton bloom area data of lake taihu to demonstrate the response of the occurrence date and duration of phytoplankton blooms to the meteorological factors i e temperature sunshine hours global radiation and wind speed similar results are also obtained from studies of lake chaohu zhang et al 2015 and lake dianchi jing et al 2019 it should be noted that the phytoplankton distribution is assumed to be vertically uniform in these studies xue et al 2015 some phytoplankton has special physiological capabilities including buoyancy regulation and low light requirements to change the vertical position for the better light conditions walsby 1994 besides wind and waves are also proved to be able to affect vertical distribution of phytoplankton throughout the water column markedly showing a negative correlation with the phytoplankton distribution cao et al 2006 however the extent to which phytoplankton can control its vertical distribution is also indirectly affected by wind which controls mixing temperature surface reflection light and upwelling nutrients xue et al 2015 generally the vertical distribution of phytoplankton is mainly governed by meteorological biological and hydrological parameters cao et al 2006 compared with the stable or shifted gaussian models of vertical phytoplankton distribution in ocean the vertical distribution of phytoplankton in lakes is more complex and changeable according to 137 in situ vertical chla profile data in lake chaohu four vertical profiles were identified including vertically uniform 35 0 gaussian 40 1 exponential 13 1 and hyperbolic models 11 8 xue et al 2015 the study on a previously developed classification tree of vertical chla profile of modis data also indicated that the whole lake chaohu presents heterogeneous distribution with the wind speed lower than 2 7 m s moreover the proportion of exponential and hyperbolic models was increased along with the decrease of wind speed fig s1 the vertical movement of phytoplankton leads to dramatic changes in the estimation of biomass from a single surface value lee et al 2012 hence there could be some deviations in the biomass response to climate change and nutrient variation based on the above mentioned two proxies for surface water accordingly there is a further need for underwater three dimensional monitoring in oceanic and inland waters including identification of vertical profile classes of phytoplankton morel and berthon 1989 xiu et al 2007 xue et al 2015 and estimation of the maximum chla depth and concentration for gaussion model bresciani et al 2014 millán núñez et al 1997 due to the difference of vertical distribution in phytoplankton in lake chaohu we previously proposed and validated a novel algorithm to measure water column integrated algal biomass cab based on the vertically heterogeneous distribution of chla to improve the accuracy of biomass inversion using the modis images hu et al 2021 however our algorithm has not been yet applied to derive the long term spatial and temporal data set of cab which may provide more insights to understand phytoplankton blooms and the drivers for lakes shi et al 2017 till now there is still a lack of comprehensive and profound understanding of the response of total cab to global warming in eutrophic lakes and additional evidence is needed to support the state and local forecasting as well as early warning management of algal blooms therefore the objectives of the present study are 1 to construct long term cab records of lake chaohu between 2000 and 2018 using the model previously developed with modis observations 2 to characterize the temporal and spatial distribution pattern of cab using the long term cab records and 3 to address sensitivity of phytoplankton to meteorological factors this study may serve as a reference to support the state and local forecasting as well as early warning management of algal blooms in other large eutrophic lakes with similar problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in the lower reaches of yangtze river lake chaohu 117 17 117 51 e 31 25 31 43 n is the fourth largest freshwater lake in china fig 1 lake chaohu is a large shallow water body with a total water area of 760 km2 and an average water depth of 3 0 m xie 2009 similar to lake taihu eutrophic lake chaohu suffers from frequent phytoplankton blooms the phytoplankton blooms have severely damaged the lake s ecological services including navigation irrigation fishing and drinking water supply to the surrounding cites from 2000 effluents were diverted and nutrient loads reduced and numerous dams sluice gates and water transfer projects were built for flood control navigation irrigation and drinking water supply lake chaohu is composed of three segments due to its lake shape western lake wl central lake cl and eastern lake el accurately evaluating the effect of the above measures and assessing of the eutrophication status of large lakes such as lake chaohu and its responses to climate change and nutrients have become urgent problems to be solved while there are well established connections between nutrient enrichment and the predominance of phytoplankton blooms especially cyanobacterial blooms in lake chaohu based on the extent of phytoplankton bloom and chla concentration on water surface zhang et al 2021 2016c 2015 there are other environmental changes that may play additional roles in promoting the recent upsurge and expansion of such blooms paerl and huisman 2009 in particular there could be a link with global warming paerl and huisman 2008 2 2 satellite image acquisition and processing the original terra modis data were downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa http modis gsfc nasa gov a total of 1387 cloud free images of lake chaohu from january 2000 to december 2018 were selected seadas 7 1 software was utilized to process the modis data to level 1 calibrated spectral radiance with spatial resolution of 250 m considering the complex aerosols and stray irradiation over inland lakes complete atmospheric correction might lead to large uncertainties ioccg 2018 rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc was calculated in this study after eliminating the gaseous absorption and scattering signals as shown in eq 1 le et al 2013 1 r r c λ ρ t λ ρ r λ ρ a λ π t λ t 0 λ r r s λ where λ is the wavelength ρt is the top of atmosphere reflectance after the gaseous absorption adjustment ρr is the reflectance due to rayleigh scattering ρa is the scattering and aerosol rayleigh interactions caused by aerosols and t and t0 are the diffuse transmittance from the water surface to the satellite and from the sun to the water surface respectively ρa t and t0 are functions of aerosol type aerosol optical thickness and solar viewing geometry respectively the formula assumes that the contribution of whitecaps and sunlight can be neglected and it is used to show the relationship between rrc and rrs in this study the rrc data are re projected through equidistance cylindrical rectangular projection feng et al 2012 2 3 climatic data the daily meteorological data air temperature wind speed wind direction etc in 2000 2018 and annual average meteorological data in 1956 2018 from the nearest national meteorological station hefei meteorological station 58 321 117 18 e 31 47 n fig 1 were downloaded from the china meteorological data sharing service system website http data cma cn 2 4 building of long term cab data set the previously developed model was used to build the long term cab data set a novel algorithm to accurately calculate the cab for lake chaohu was proposed and validated using the rrc data of modis in our previous study hu et al 2021 here the algorithm was employed to build the long term cab data for lake chaohu between 2000 and 2018 according to the algorithm the total algal biomass in a unit water column btotal was separated into biomass inside beu and outside bou the euphotic zone 2 b t o t a l b e u b o u the algal biomass index abi was applied to determine total algal biomass inside euphotic zone which was defined as the difference in remote sensing reflectance rrs sr 1 at 555 nm normalized against two baselines with one formed linearly between rrs 859 and rrs 469 and another formed linearly between rrs 645 and rrs 469 3 a b i 1 r r s 555 r r s 469 r r s 859 r r s 469 555 469 859 469 4 a b i 2 r r s 555 r r s 469 r r s 645 r

functional relationship with the algal biomass in the euphotic zone r 2 0 88 p 0 01 n 50 7 b e u 96 256 a b i r r s 1 84 96 because the complete atmospheric correction rrs might lead to large uncertainties due to the complex aerosols and stray irradiation over inland lakes ioccg 2018 rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc based algorithm was used to calculate the total algal biomass as a substitute combined with all atmospheric conditions and angles of observation abi rrc showed a very good linear relationship with abi rrs 8 a b i r r c 3 0665 a b i r r s 0 0008 considering that optical properties below the euphotic zone cannot be detected by rrs bou was indirectly calculated by an empirical algorithm based on the same data set 9 b o u 79 68 e x p 0 005 b e u 3 z e u d z e u where beu represents the biomass inside the euphotic zones zeu is the depth of euphotic zone and d represents water depth m at a specific location synchronous satellite data and in situ data are applied to validate the rrc based simulation ability for cab showing an acceptable precision of estimation with mre mean relative error 21 86 and rmse root mean square error 17 98 mg from previous study hu et al 2021 furthermore both inter day and consecutive day validations revealed good stability and rationality fig s2 therefore modis derived cab data set was built by this algorithm in this study as a note in this study the unit for the total algal biomass of the whole lake is t chla and that for pixel based algal biomass is mg chla 2 5 simulation of current and divergence fields the hydrodynamic numerical model including the discretization and calibration methods of the three segments of lake chaohu has been discussed in detail in previous studies huang et al 2018 peng et al 2019 2021 in this study the princeton ocean model pom blumberg and mellor 1987 mellor 2004 mellor and yamada 1982 was used to achieve the variables including velocity components u v and w in the x y and z directions respectively under different wind speeds and directions the detailed description of pom and its revision for lake chaohu was formulated based on chen s study chen and liu 2015 the model domain and boundary condition referred to the framework for real time forecasting of daily water quality variables for lake chaohu peng et al 2019 rectangular grids were used for setting up the model containing 2946 active cells with a uniform grid size of 250 m on the basis of the current field results the divergence value was calculated by the following formula 10 d i v a u x v y where u and v are the velocity components in the x and y direction respectively if the divergence value of a control volume is larger than 0 the volume will be divergent while the value less than 0 indicates a convergent volume then the convergence zones of algal bloom can be identified li and qin 2019 in our study the simulation of current and divergence fields was used to analyze the relationship between spatial distribution of cab and hydrodynamic conditions of lake chaohu 2 6 unsupervised classification unsupervised classification is used in spatial classification without prior category criteria based on the difference in classification characteristics of different image features in the feature space bruzzone et al 2002 iterative self organizing data analysis techniques algorithm isodata is an unsupervised classification method that can obtain a reasonable number of categories by continuously merging and splitting the clustering results thus obtaining better classification results ma et al 2012 in the present study based on the pixel based cab of lake chaohu the whole lake was separated by the unsupervised classification into several zones with different spatial characteristics of the pixel based cab from 2000 to 2018 2 7 statistical analysis breaks for additive seasonal and trend bfast was employed to estimate phenological changes within a time series in a large range of ecosystems by simulating or applying time series satellite images jamali et al 2015 reiche et al 2015 sulla menashe et al 2014 verbesselt et al 2010a 2010b based on monthly modis images from 2000 to 2018 the bfast integrated the decomposition of time series cab images into trend seasonal and remainder components through detection methods for long term phenological changes the methods were available in the bfast package for r r development core team 2009 from cran http cran r project org package bfast verbesselt et al 2010a 2012 in this study the bfast was used to estimate and compare the seasonal trends in area and wind speed of algal blooms statistical program for social sciences spss 17 0 software was used for the statistical analyses pearson s correlation analysis method was used to investigate inter annual monthly and climatic environmental drivers for the total cab and pixel based cab variations the mann kendall test was employed to determine whether a time series data had a monotonic upward or downward trend p 0 05 was set as the significance level 3 results 3 1 long term changes in climatic conditions air temperature and wind speed are two key climatic factors associated with global warming according to the data from hefei meteorological station generally it is noteworthy that from 1956 to 2018 the annual mean air temperature was increased by about 14 2 with an average rate of 0 11 c y p 0 001 while the annual mean wind speed at the height of 10 m was decreased by about 41 8 with an average rate of 0 073 m s y during the same period r2 0 055 p 0 064 fig 2 in detail the variation trend of air temperature was not apparent before 1980 while most of the increase was significant from 1980 to 2018 r2 0 604 and p 0 001 the wind speed showed a significant decline occurred after 2000 r2 0 828 and p 0 001 fig 2 similar long term variations in temperature and wind speed are also found in lake taihu another eutrophic lake in china shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 3 2 temporal variations in total cab the statistical characteristics of the modis derived total cab data demonstrated that lake chaohu experienced significant upward inter annual variation in the total cab between 2000 and 2018 mann kendall test p 0 009 during this period the annual mean of total cab in lake chaohu fluctuated between 62 06 t chla in 2003 and 76 03 t chla in 2015 with an average of 67 26 t chla fig 3 a the total cba experienced three markedly different inter annual variations the total algal biomass showed a slight downward trend before 2006 increased from 2006 to 2009 decreased sharply in 2010 and then appeared a weak growth after 2010 fig 3a bfast displayed states a clear increasing trend during the 19 year period with the total cab increased at 0 569 t chla y since 2000 fig 3b the waters of the entire lake were characterized by high algal biomass in all four seasons and strong seasonal variability overall the cab in summer june to august and autumn september to november was significantly higher than that in spring march to may and winter december to february fig 4 the mean values for the entire lake in summer and autumn were 74 16 10 70 t chla and 67 94 10 62 t chla respectively the highest mean total cab 82 14 t chla for the entire lake was observed in august whereas the lowest mean value 59 45 t chla appeared in december in addition the bfast analysis indicated an intra annual periodic change of the total cab in lake chaohu with a bimodal annual cycle every year fig 3c specifically the total cab first peaked in august and september 77 93 7 82 t chla and was the lowest in december 59 52 3 02 t chla the second peak of total cab was found in march 69 69 5 27 t chla and the second valley was found in april 63 49 4 95 t chla hence it was believed that the seasonal change of phytoplankton composition is considered as the main reason for the seasonal variation in the total cab for lake chaohu 3 3 patterns of spatiotemporal variations in pixel based cab 3 3 1 inter annual variations in pixel based cab the time series pixel based cab maps presented significant spatial and inter annual variability from 2000 to 2018 fig 5 for the entire lake the pixel based cab varied widely from 112 42 mg chla in november 2016 to 166 85 mg chla in august 2012 with a long term mean of 128 74 mg chla s d 9 45 mg chla it was also shown in fig 5 that before 2010 the high mean pixel based cab was mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of western and eastern lake chaohu after 2010 the high pixel based cab of western lake chaohu gradually covered the whole lake area of the wl meanwhile the high value area of the el area also increased especially in the central part the long term mean values of pixel based cab for wl cl and el fig s3 were 131 43 mg chla s d 12 94 mg chla 126 31 mg chla s d 9 31 mg chla and 126 36 mg chla s d 7 87 mg chla respectively the pixel based cab for cl was generally the lowest among the three segments despite the consistently higher the pixel based cab for wl and el the pixel based cab for wl ranging from 111 28 mg in november 2016 to 204 07 mg in august 2012 varied much more dramatically than that in el ranging from 112 35 mg in december 2003 to 155 21 mg in september 2018 3 3 2 seasonal and monthly variations in pixel based cab there was strong seasonal variability in the pixel based cab for the entire lake fig 6 the pixel based cab values significantly increased in summer compared to those in winter mann kendall test p 0 01 and the mean values for the entire lake in summer and winter were 136 28 mg chla and 122 69 mg chla respectively the pixel based cab variations showed monthly spatial differences fig s4 the highest mean pixel based cab value 139 67 mg chla for the entire lake was found in august whereas the lowest mean pixel based cab value 117 86 mg chla appeared in december the areas with high algal biomass from april to october were mainly concentrated in the coast of western lake chaohu and those with high algal biomass from november to march were mainly distributed in the central and eastern lake chaohu time series of the seasonal averages of the modis derived pixel based cab values from 2000 to 2018 were constructed for the three segments and entire lake by spatially and temporally averaging all valid pixels over the waters of each part fig 7 seasonal pattern of the modis derived pixel based cab distribution in the three segments was generally similar to that in the entire lake showing higher values in summer and lower values in winter in terms of spatial distribution the highest pixel based cab values appeared in the wl while lower values were found in the cl and el 3 3 3 spatial distribution characterization of pixel based cab the modis derived pixel based cab from 2000 to 2018 was averaged to calculate the regional biomass distribution for lake chaohu fig 8 a the mean pixel based cab ranging from 112 42 to 166 85 mg chla was the highest in the wl especially its northern part followed by that in the el and it was the lowest in the cl the spatial distribution of the s d values was also formulated using the modis derived pixel based cab values between 2000 and 2018 fig 8b the s d value of the pixel based cab varied from 15 42 mg chla in the wl to 9 49 mg chla in the el with an average of 12 98 mg chla indicating a substantial spatial variation in the cab the variations in the pixel based cab for the wl were much larger than those for the other two segments of lake chaohu the annual growth rate of the pixel based cab for water area was 10 40 10 44 with an average of 1 92 fig 9 it was indicated that the areas with the fastest annual growth of pixel based cab were concentrated in the southern part of wl and the central parts of cl and el 3 3 4 spatial classification based on time series pixel based cab on the basis of the spatial and temporal distribution data of algal biomass in lake chaohu the spatial heterogeneity of algal abundance in lake chaohu was analyzed by unsupervised classification the whole lake area was divided into five zones zone i was mainly located near the nanfei river estuary which was seriously polluted fig 10 zone ii had relatively low pixel based cab which was mainly located in the cl and el zone iii covered the most part of wl and the north coast of el zone iv was the transitional area between zones iii and v of wl and zone v was mainly distributed in the coastal area of lake chaohu in addition the long term trend analysis of the five zones showed that the pixel based cab of zone v had a downward trend whereas the change of zone i was not significant and the three other types of zones showed an increasing trend seasonal and periodic characteristic analysis showed that although the five zones all showed bimodal periodic changes the specific time when peak and valley values occurred in the five zones were different among them the first two algal biomass peaks appeared earlier in zone iii than those in other zones whereas the second biomass peak of zone i appeared the latest and only the first biomass peak occurred just next to that of zone iii 3 4 sensitivity to climatic factors in order to further explore the effects of climatic factors on algal biomass the daily synchronous temperature wind speed and total cab were utilized to describe the yearly and monthly variation characteristics of correlation coefficient on the whole the total algal biomass increased significantly with the increase of temperature r 0 452 p 0 001 n 1387 but it was negatively correlated with wind speed r 0 236 p 0 001 n 1387 similar relationships were also observed between the total cab and temperature or wind speed every year fig 11 a besides the inter annual correlation coefficients between total cab and two climatic factors temperature and wind speed were relative steady without remarkable trends during 2000 2018 r2 0 106 p 0 174 r2 0 042 p 0 401 however monthly correlation coefficients between the total cab and temperature varied dramatically fig 11b the correlation coefficient between the total cab and temperature fluctuated between 0 2 and 0 4 except that in february july august and december the reason is that microcystis the dominant phytoplankton in lake chaohu begins recruitment at 11 c in spring and overwinter at 10 cwith an optimum growth temperature of 20 30 c yang et al 2020 the lower even negative correlation coefficients in these four months demonstrated that the photosynthetic activity and growth rate of phytoplankton can be repressed and even decreased below or above the optimum temperature mowe et al 2015 yang et al 2020 fig 12 shows that there was a significant positive correlation between pixel based cab and air temperature on different time scales and the correlation was enhanced with the increase of time scale for daily data the areas with high correlations were mainly located in the south coast downwind of the local prevailing wind direction in winter and spring nevertheless the correlation coefficient between the relative abundance of algae and air temperature in wl was not very high with the increase of time scale the correlation coefficient between total algae biomass and air temperature increased to more than 0 3 even exceeding 0 5 in the wl except for the areas around the route to the el air temperature has a significant effect on the change of algal biomass considering the delay of algae growth the change of pixel based algal biomass was more sensitive to the temperature change on the monthly and annual scales the wind driven flow is the main driving force of algae migration cao et al 2006 zhang et al 2021 even though wind is not a decisive factor for the growth of algae fig 12 reveals that there were significant spatial differences in the correlation between algal biomass in pixel column and wind speed on different time scales the analysis of daily data showed that 96 24 of algal biomass for the whole lake area was negatively correlated with wind speed their correlation turned from negative to positive with the increase of time scale and the monthly and annual algal biomass in the northeast bay of the wl and the southeast coast had a stronger positive correlation with the wind speed indicating that in the case of a higher wind speed the algae can accumulate in the downwind direction more easily and the pixel based algae biomass may be greater it should be noted that the average annual value contains much more details than the daily result and may even lead to the opposite findings in our opinion in short the wind changes rapidly which directly influences the short term spatial temporal redistribution of algal biomass the sensitivity of spatial temporal distribution of biomass to temperature and wind on different time scales demonstrated that climate change impacts on the lake ecosystem and its process in detail contributing to local pollution control ecological restoration and water source protection in lake chaohu 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of remote algal bloom area or surface biomass algal bloom area is one of the most traditional proxy for remote monitoring of phytoplankton biomass hu et al 2010 which is always used to explore lake ecosystem variation duan et al 2009 shi et al 2019 zhang et al 2016b the rapid vertical movement of caynobacteria can lead to dramatic changes in the estimation results of biomass from a single surface value hu et al 2021 lee et al 2012 for example during july 21 to 24 2011 the algal bloom area fluctuated between 13 31 km2 and 508 13 km2 with an average wind speed of 1 3 1 9 m s fig s5 however it was impossible for algae to have such drastic changes in biomass in just four days which had been confirmed by remote algae biomass ranging from 85 92 t chla 87 05 t chla long term comparison in fig 13 indicated that it seemed a certain correlation r 0 555 p 0 001 n 902 between algal bloom area and algal biomass in the water column yet their relationship was not one to one algal biomass in the water column showed better stability than that in areas as well as a certain phenological fluctuation due to constantly change of meteorological factors especially wind speed zhang et al 2021 the algal bloom area with drastic changes didn t show satisfied consistency with algal biomass in the water column algal biomass in water column was the basis of algal bloom formation so the algae bloom area on the water surface alone could not represent the total biomass in the whole water column in addition the dramatic change of algal bloom area could also hamper the understanding of lake ecosystem variation and its environmental driving factors and result in high risk of wrong judgment and decision making hu et al 2021 hence remote algal biomass instead of algal bloom area was recommended to reflect algae variations in water objectively furthermore previous studies on environmental driving forces based on algal bloom area should be re validated by algal biomass in water column next the algal biomass inside and outside euphotic zone of lake chaohu was compared quantitatively fig s6 overall for the whole lake chaohu the algal biomass outside the euphotic zone remained stable at 20 94 3 59 t chla whereas the algal biomass inside the euphotic zone showed acute changes with an average of 44 96 12 65 t chla the algal biomass in the euphotic zone accounted for 41 2 94 8 of the total algal biomass about 137 in situ chla profile data in lake chaohu were used to discuss the relationship between algal bloom biomass in the euphotic zone and on water surface within 0 5 m fig s6b it was indicated that when the vertical distribution of algae was uniform there was a linear relationship between the algal biomass however a complex relationship could also be detected which was closely related to the vertical heterogeneity of algae 4 2 action mechanisms of climatic factors on the cab variations previous studies suggested that variations in total phytoplankton biomass is possibly affected by several climatic factors such as temperature and wind besides nutrients and light conditions paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and paul 2012 shi et al 2015 whitton and potts 2000 some published studies showed that microcystis and anabaena are the dominant genera of bloom forming cyanobacteria in lake chaohu and aphanizomenon is the dominant genus occasionally in some south coast kong et al 2017 yu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a it was argued that cyanobacteria were favored by higher temperature r 0 452 p 0 001 n 1387 fig 11a indicating that higher temperature could promote the increase of the total cab rising temperature benefits phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria through several mechanisms first as the dominant phytoplankton in lake chaohu cyanobacteria generally grow better at higher temperatures i e 25 c so they are endowed with a competitive advantage at elevated temperatures paerl and paul 2012 paul 2008 whitton and potts 2000 yang et al 2020 second warming of surface waters is also associated with thermal stratification and changes in turbulent mixing that provide an environmental benefit to the buoyant cyanobacteria paerl and huisman 2008 whitton and potts 2000 third because of global warming earlier resuscitation in spring and later dormancy in winter lengthen the optimal growth periods of phytoplankton furthermore it has also been evidenced that a large number of cyanobacteria can give positive feedback by further increasing the water surface temperature through the intense absorption of light which consolidates the competitive advantage of buoyant cyanobacteria paerl and huisman 2008 wind appears to affect the total cab which is evident from the negative correlations between wind speed and total cab fig 11a although wind is not one of the three major factors affecting algae growth whitton and potts 2000 it can indirectly influence algae growth by affecting its growth environment for example sediment re suspension induced by wind force determines the light conditions subsequently causing high turbidity in turn the high turbidity reduces light availability and therefore decreases the intensity of phytoplankton bloom and total cab shi et al 2015 it is worth noting that spatial details of pixel based cab depend on the hydrodynamic situations of lakes affected by wind based on the daily data of wind speed and direction in lake chaohu since 2000 the dominant wind direction is the east wind 14 4 followed by the south wind 9 7 the average wind speed of different wind directions is 2 02 2 77 m s and that of the east wind is 2 67 m s in this study the scenario of the dominant wind direction and its average wind speed of 2 67 m s were selected to calculate the spatial distribution of 3d flow field and divergence distribution in lake chaohu by virtue of the pom model fig 14 a shows that the divergence of lake chaohu was generally low in the west basically negative and high in the east basically positive under the east wind the divergence of the inflow mouth of nanfei river wuli river and pai river was the lowest a section curve was selected from nanfei river estuary to lake chaohu gate to further analyze the relationship between the divergence and the spatial distribution of total algal biomass fig 14b the results of the divergence and the average total algal biomass in the section are presented in fig 14c from the nanfei river estuary to lake chaohu gate the divergence changed from 0 01 s 1 to 0 0035 s 1 whereas the pixel based cab decreased from 135 79 mg to 123 04 mg and there was a significant correlation between the divergence and pixel based cab r 0 77 p 0 01 n 60 thus the spatial distribution of divergence controlled by wind and lake bathymetry determines the spatial distribution of algal biomass in short climatic factors temperature and wind mainly influenced the total cab in water and the heterogeneity and spatial details of pixel based cab depended on the hydrodynamic situations of lakes affected by meteorological factors such as wind furthermore forecasting models for cyanobacterial blooms could benefit from meteorological factors such as air temperature and wind as prediction parameters shi et al 2017 according to the relationship between algal biomass and climatic factors during 2000 and 2018 when the wind speed is decreased by 0 1 and 0 5 m s the total algal biomass in lake chaohu will increase by 0 34 and 1 7 t chla respectively assuming that the water quality and other relevant elements are stable similarly when the temperature increases by 0 1 and 0 5 c the total algal biomass will increase by 0 05 and 0 26 t chla respectively in recent years total nitrogen total phosphorus and chla in lake chaohu has been increased significantly and water quality improvement has been slowed down while lake chaohu may face more severe challenges with the future climatic warming 4 3 implications for environmental management protecting drinking water and fisheries minimizing economic and ecosystem losses and protecting public health are the main objectives for algal bloom management shi et al 2019 scientific monitoring is the first critical step of environmental management to determine a scientific monitoring index and develop an effective monitoring method up to now algal bloom area has become one of the most traditional proxies for algal bloom management hu et al 2010 but its drastic changes often bring some confusion to the prediction and decision making of algal bloom it is strongly recommended that the algal biomass in the water column instead of algal bloom area can be regarded as a new algal bloom index our study results clearly demonstrated that the total algal biomass in lake chaohu have significantly increased and influenced by climatic factors despite a variety of pollution control measures taken moreover the combination of algal biomass and ecological model could further improve the accuracy of algal bloom prediction becoming an important support for early warning of phytoplankton bloom in lake chaohu in a broader perspective the approach of remote algal biomass in the water column proposed here can be used as a template to reduce cost and increase management efficiency and it may be extended to many other inland eutrophic lakes with frequent algal blooms once the remote algorithm parameters of algal biomass are calibrated using related local data and the new satellite derived biomass products are validated similar long term dynamics can be derived the efficient and cost effective satellite derived biomass products can provide continuous and long term assessment as well as immediate value and useful decision support tools for other inland lake waters therefore it is recommended in this study that remote algal biomass in the water column should be considered in future eutrophic lake monitoring to aid in the interpretation of spatial and temporal patterns of important water quality parameters and the evaluation of the risk early warning of algal blooms 5 conclusion remote sensing techniques were used to address cab dynamics and its environmental drivers in lake chaohu a typical eutrophic lake with frequent algal blooms in china first long term cab in the water column were obtained from modis observations gathered from 2000 to 2018 based on a remote cab model of hu hu et al 2021 second the long term daily total cab for lake chaohu fluctuated between 48 2 and 118 6 t chla with an increasing rate of 0 569 t chla y the total cab for lake chaohu varied considerably in space and time with high values in the wl and el and with a lower value in the cl the total biomass in summer and autumn were found to be significantly higher than that in spring and winter the highest mean total cab 82 14 t chla for the entire lake was found in august whereas the lowest mean value 59 45 t chla appeared in december third the responses of cab dynamics to climatic conditions and hydrodynamic situations were analyzed based on modis derived cab data the results indicated that high temperature and low wind speed can promote the growth of total cab for the whole lake the sensitivity of cab dynamics to climatic conditions was found to vary by region and time scale the spatial details depended on the hydrodynamic situations of lakes affected by meteorological factors wind etc and the divergence convergence processes in the fluid medium determined the spatial

16475,there are some uncertainties of using chlorophyll a chla concentrations in water surface to address phytoplankton dynamics especially in large shallow lakes because of the dramatic vertical migration of phytoplankton the column integrated algal biomass cab can reflect the whole water column information so it is considered as a better indicator for phytoplankton total biomass an algal biomass index abi and an empirical algorithm were proposed previously to measure algal biomass inside and outside euphotic zone from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis data a long term cab time series was generated in this study to clarify the temporal and spatial changes in phytoplankton and address its sensitivity to climatic factors in lake chaohu a shallow eutrophic lake in china from 2000 to 2018 overall the cab for lake chaohu showed significant temporal and spatial dynamics temporally the annual average cab total cba within the whole lake was increased at rate of 0 569 t chla y ranging from 62 06 8 89 t chla to 76 03 10 01 t chla during the 19 year period seasonal and periodic variations in total cab presented a bimodal annual cycle every year the total cab was highest in summer followed by that in autumn and it was the lowest in winter the pixel based cab total cab of a unit water column ranging from 112 42 to 166 85 mg chla was the highest in the western segment especially its northern part and was the lowest in the central parts of eastern and central segments the sensitivity of cab dynamics to climatic conditions was found to vary by region and time scale specifically the change of pixel based algal biomass was more sensitive to the temperature change on the monthly and annual scales while wind speed impacted directly on the short term spatial temporal redistribution of algal biomass high temperature and low wind speed could prompt the growth of total cab for the whole lake and the hydrodynamic situations affected by wind and so on determined the spatial details it also indicated that lake chaohu may face more severe challenges with the future climatic warming this study may serve as a reference to support algal bloom

modis eutrophic lakes 1 introduction lakes around the world are suffering from phytoplankton blooms especially under the climate warming and increasing eutrophication such as lake taihu qin et al 2015 lake chaohu zhang et al 2016a and lake dianchi shan et al 2019 in china lake kasumiguara in japan oyama et al 2015 lake erie in north american scavia et al 2019 and lake victoria in africa nyamweya et al 2020 phytoplankton blooms can pose a serious threat to water quality and aquatic ecosystems ho et al 2019 certain species of phytoplankton float and accumulate on the water surface thus weakening the underwater light environment and depressing underwater macrophytes qin et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 as the result of the microbial degradation of senescent blooms oxygen depletion may induce hypoxia and anoxia causing the death of fish and benthic invertebrates paerl and paul 2012 pal et al 2020 moreover some species of phytoplankton e g cyanobacteria are widely known to produce a variety of cyanotoxins that cause hepatic digestive and neurological diseases when ingested by birds mammals and human otten et al 2012 posing a serious threat to irrigation and drinking water supplies shi et al 2015 it is crucial to accurately monitor phytoplankton bloom dynamics and identify the controlling environmental drivers for phytoplankton bloom management treatment and forecasting ship based sampling approach combined with laboratory analysis is a traditional way to quantitatively assess surface phytoplankton biomass qin et al 2015 similarly by which phytoplankton biomass in water column can be evaluated layer by layer however due to the complexity and costs of in situ measurements it is quite difficult to generalize the laboratory findings on large spatial and temporal scales jutla et al 2012 li and he 2014 given the spatial and temporal advantages remote sensing technology has often been used to estimate the optical properties lee et al 2002 determine key optically active constituents odermatt et al 2012 and detect the extent and frequency of phytoplankton blooms duan et al 2009 shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b till now bloom area hu 2009 and pigment concentration i e chlorophyll a chla or phycocyanin duan et al 2012 kutser et al 2006 matthews et al 2012 qi et al 2014 on water surface are the widely used proxies for remote monitoring of phytoplankton biomass several recent studies have applied long term remotely sensed data to estimate the response of phytoplankton bloom dynamics to environmental variables based on these two proxies for example duan duan et al 2009 and zhang zhang et al 2012 used moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis derived phytoplankton bloom area data of lake taihu to demonstrate the response of the occurrence date and duration of phytoplankton blooms to the meteorological factors i e temperature sunshine hours global radiation and wind speed similar results are also obtained from studies of lake chaohu zhang et al 2015 and lake dianchi jing et al 2019 it should be noted that the phytoplankton distribution is assumed to be vertically uniform in these studies xue et al 2015 some phytoplankton has special physiological capabilities including buoyancy regulation and low light requirements to change the vertical position for the better light conditions walsby 1994 besides wind and waves are also proved to be able to affect vertical distribution of phytoplankton throughout the water column markedly showing a negative correlation with the phytoplankton distribution cao et al 2006 however the extent to which phytoplankton can control its vertical distribution is also indirectly affected by wind which controls mixing temperature surface reflection light and upwelling nutrients xue et al 2015 generally the vertical distribution of phytoplankton is mainly governed by meteorological biological and hydrological parameters cao et al 2006 compared with the stable or shifted gaussian models of vertical phytoplankton distribution in ocean the vertical distribution of phytoplankton in lakes is more complex and changeable according to 137 in situ vertical chla profile data in lake chaohu four vertical profiles were identified including vertically uniform 35 0 gaussian 40 1 exponential 13 1 and hyperbolic models 11 8 xue et al 2015 the study on a previously developed classification tree of vertical chla profile of modis data also indicated that the whole lake chaohu presents heterogeneous distribution with the wind speed lower than 2 7 m s moreover the proportion of exponential and hyperbolic models was increased along with the decrease of wind speed fig s1 the vertical movement of phytoplankton leads to dramatic changes in the estimation of biomass from a single surface value lee et al 2012 hence there could be some deviations in the biomass response to climate change and nutrient variation based on the above mentioned two proxies for surface water accordingly there is a further need for underwater three dimensional monitoring in oceanic and inland waters including identification of vertical profile classes of phytoplankton morel and berthon 1989 xiu et al 2007 xue et al 2015 and estimation of the maximum chla depth and concentration for gaussion model bresciani et al 2014 millán núñez et al 1997 due to the difference of vertical distribution in phytoplankton in lake chaohu we previously proposed and validated a novel algorithm to measure water column integrated algal biomass cab based on the vertically heterogeneous distribution of chla to improve the accuracy of biomass inversion using the modis images hu et al 2021 however our algorithm has not been yet applied to derive the long term spatial and temporal data set of cab which may provide more insights to understand phytoplankton blooms and the drivers for lakes shi et al 2017 till now there is still a lack of comprehensive and profound understanding of the response of total cab to global warming in eutrophic lakes and additional evidence is needed to support the state and local forecasting as well as early warning management of algal blooms therefore the objectives of the present study are 1 to construct long term cab records of lake chaohu between 2000 and 2018 using the model previously developed with modis observations 2 to characterize the temporal and spatial distribution pattern of cab using the long term cab records and 3 to address sensitivity of phytoplankton to meteorological factors this study may serve as a reference to support the state and local forecasting as well as early warning management of algal blooms in other large eutrophic lakes with similar problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in the lower reaches of yangtze river lake chaohu 117 17 117 51 e 31 25 31 43 n is the fourth largest freshwater lake in china fig 1 lake chaohu is a large shallow water body with a total water area of 760 km2 and an average water depth of 3 0 m xie 2009 similar to lake taihu eutrophic lake chaohu suffers from frequent phytoplankton blooms the phytoplankton blooms have severely damaged the lake s ecological services including navigation irrigation fishing and drinking water supply to the surrounding cites from 2000 effluents were diverted and nutrient loads reduced and numerous dams sluice gates and water transfer projects were built for flood control navigation irrigation and drinking water supply lake chaohu is composed of three segments due to its lake shape western lake wl central lake cl and eastern lake el accurately evaluating the effect of the above measures and assessing of the eutrophication status of large lakes such as lake chaohu and its responses to climate change and nutrients have become urgent problems to be solved while there are well established connections between nutrient enrichment and the predominance of phytoplankton blooms especially cyanobacterial blooms in lake chaohu based on the extent of phytoplankton bloom and chla concentration on water surface zhang et al 2021 2016c 2015 there are other environmental changes that may play additional roles in promoting the recent upsurge and expansion of such blooms paerl and huisman 2009 in particular there could be a link with global warming paerl and huisman 2008 2 2 satellite image acquisition and processing the original terra modis data were downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa http modis gsfc nasa gov a total of 1387 cloud free images of lake chaohu from january 2000 to december 2018 were selected seadas 7 1 software was utilized to process the modis data to level 1 calibrated spectral radiance with spatial resolution of 250 m considering the complex aerosols and stray irradiation over inland lakes complete atmospheric correction might lead to large uncertainties ioccg 2018 rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc was calculated in this study after eliminating the gaseous absorption and scattering signals as shown in eq 1 le et al 2013 1 r r c λ ρ t λ ρ r λ ρ a λ π t λ t 0 λ r r s λ where λ is the wavelength ρt is the top of atmosphere reflectance after the gaseous absorption adjustment ρr is the reflectance due to rayleigh scattering ρa is the scattering and aerosol rayleigh interactions caused by aerosols and t and t0 are the diffuse transmittance from the water surface to the satellite and from the sun to the water surface respectively ρa t and t0 are functions of aerosol type aerosol optical thickness and solar viewing geometry respectively the formula assumes that the contribution of whitecaps and sunlight can be neglected and it is used to show the relationship between rrc and rrs in this study the rrc data are re projected through equidistance cylindrical rectangular projection feng et al 2012 2 3 climatic data the daily meteorological data air temperature wind speed wind direction etc in 2000 2018 and annual average meteorological data in 1956 2018

cma cn 2 4 building of long term cab data set the previously developed model was used to build the long term cab data set a novel algorithm to accurately calculate the cab for lake chaohu was proposed and validated using the rrc data of modis in our previous study hu et al 2021 here the algorithm was employed to build the long term cab data for lake chaohu between 2000 and 2018 according to the algorithm the total algal biomass in a unit water column btotal was separated into biomass inside beu and outside bou the euphotic zone 2 b t o t a l b e u b o u the algal biomass index abi was applied to determine total algal biomass inside euphotic zone which was defined as the difference in remote sensing reflectance rrs sr 1 at 555 nm normalized against two baselines with one formed linearly between rrs 859 and rrs 469 and another formed linearly between rrs 645 and rrs 469 3 a b i 1 r r s 555 r r s 469 r r s 859 r r s 469 555 469 859 469 4 a b i 2 r r s 555 r r s 469 r r s 645 r

functional relationship with the algal biomass in the euphotic zone r 2 0 88 p 0 01 n 50 7 b e u 96 256 a b i r r s 1 84 96 because the complete atmospheric correction rrs might lead to large uncertainties due to the complex aerosols and stray irradiation over inland lakes ioccg 2018 rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc based algorithm was used to calculate the total algal biomass as a substitute combined with all atmospheric conditions and angles of observation abi rrc showed a very good linear relationship with abi rrs 8 a b i r r c 3 0665 a b i r r s 0 0008 considering that optical properties below the euphotic zone cannot be detected by rrs bou was indirectly calculated by an empirical algorithm based on the same data set 9 b o u 79 68 e x p 0 005 b e u 3 z e u d z e u where beu represents the biomass inside the euphotic zones zeu is the depth of euphotic zone and d represents water depth m at a specific location synchronous satellite data and in situ data are applied to validate the rrc based simulation ability for cab showing an acceptable precision of estimation with mre mean relative error 21 86 and rmse root mean square error 17 98 mg from previous study hu et al 2021 furthermore both inter day and consecutive day validations revealed good stability and rationality fig s2 therefore modis derived cab data set was built by this algorithm in this study as a note in this study the unit for the total algal biomass of the whole lake is t chla and that for pixel based algal biomass is mg chla 2 5 simulation of current and divergence fields the hydrodynamic numerical model including the discretization and calibration methods of the three segments of lake chaohu has been discussed in detail in previous studies huang et al 2018 peng et al 2019 2021 in this study the princeton ocean model pom blumberg and mellor 1987 mellor 2004 mellor and yamada 1982 was used to achieve the variables including velocity components u v and w in the x y and z directions respectively under different wind speeds and directions the detailed description of pom and its revision for lake chaohu was formulated based on chen s study chen and liu 2015 the model domain and boundary condition referred to the framework for real time forecasting of daily water quality variables for lake chaohu peng et al 2019 rectangular grids were used for setting up the model containing 2946 active cells with a uniform grid size of 250 m on the basis of the current field results the divergence value was calculated by the following formula 10 d i v a u x v y where u and v are the velocity components in the x and y direction respectively if the divergence value of a control volume is larger than 0 the volume will be divergent while the value less than 0 indicates a convergent volume then the convergence zones of algal bloom can be identified li and qin 2019 in our study the simulation of current and divergence fields was used to analyze the relationship between spatial distribution of cab and hydrodynamic conditions of lake chaohu 2 6 unsupervised classification unsupervised classification is used in spatial classification without prior category criteria based on the difference in classification characteristics of different image features in the feature space bruzzone et al 2002 iterative self organizing data analysis techniques algorithm isodata is an unsupervised classification method that can obtain a reasonable number of categories by continuously merging and splitting the clustering results thus obtaining better classification results ma et al 2012 in the present study based on the pixel based cab of lake chaohu the whole lake was separated by the unsupervised classification into several zones with different spatial characteristics of the pixel based cab from 2000 to 2018 2 7 statistical analysis breaks for additive seasonal and trend bfast was employed to estimate phenological changes within a time series in a large range of ecosystems by simulating or applying time series satellite images jamali et al 2015 reiche et al 2015 sulla menashe et al 2014 verbesselt et al 2010a 2010b based on monthly modis images from 2000 to 2018 the bfast integrated the decomposition of time series cab images into trend seasonal and remainder components through detection methods for long term phenological changes the methods were available in the bfast package for r r development core team 2009 from cran http cran r project org package bfast verbesselt et al 2010a 2012 in this study the bfast was used to estimate and compare the seasonal trends in area and wind speed of algal blooms statistical program for social sciences spss 17 0 software was used for the statistical analyses pearson s correlation analysis method was used to investigate inter annual monthly and climatic environmental drivers for the total cab and pixel based cab variations the mann kendall test was employed to determine whether a time series data had a monotonic upward or downward trend p 0 05 was set as the significance level 3 results 3 1 long term changes in climatic conditions air temperature and wind speed are two key climatic factors associated with global warming according to the data from hefei meteorological station generally it is noteworthy that from 1956 to 2018 the annual mean air temperature was increased by about 14 2 with an average rate of 0 11 c y p 0 001 while the annual mean wind speed at the height of 10 m was decreased by about 41 8 with an average rate of 0 073 m s y during the same period r2 0 055 p 0 064 fig 2 in detail the variation trend of air temperature was not apparent before 1980 while most of the increase was significant from 1980 to 2018 r2 0 604 and p 0 001 the wind speed showed a significant decline occurred after 2000 r2 0 828 and p 0 001 fig 2 similar long term variations in temperature and wind speed are also found in lake taihu another eutrophic lake in china shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 3 2 temporal variations in total cab the statistical characteristics of the modis derived total cab data demonstrated that lake chaohu experienced significant upward inter annual variation in the total cab between 2000 and 2018 mann kendall test p 0 009 during this period the annual mean of total cab in lake chaohu fluctuated between 62 06 t chla in 2003 and 76 03 t chla in 2015 with an average of 67 26 t chla fig 3 a the total cba experienced three markedly different inter annual variations the total algal biomass showed a slight downward trend before 2006 increased from 2006 to 2009 decreased sharply in 2010 and then appeared a weak growth after 2010 fig 3a bfast displayed states a clear increasing trend during the 19 year period with the total cab increased at 0 569 t chla y since 2000 fig 3b the waters of the entire lake were characterized by high algal biomass in all four seasons and strong seasonal variability overall the cab in summer june to august and autumn september to november was significantly higher than that in spring march to may and winter december to february fig 4 the mean values for the entire lake in summer and autumn were 74 16 10 70 t chla and 67 94 10 62 t chla respectively the highest mean total cab 82 14 t chla for the entire lake was observed in august whereas the lowest mean value 59 45 t chla appeared in december in addition the bfast analysis indicated an intra annual periodic change of the total cab in lake chaohu with a bimodal annual cycle every year fig 3c specifically the total cab first peaked in august and september 77 93 7 82 t chla and was the lowest in december 59 52 3 02 t chla the second peak of total cab was found in march 69 69 5 27 t chla and the second valley was found in april 63 49 4 95 t chla hence it was believed that the seasonal change of phytoplankton composition is considered as the main reason for the seasonal variation in the total cab for lake chaohu 3 3 patterns of spatiotemporal variations in pixel based cab 3 3 1 inter annual variations in pixel based cab the time series pixel based cab maps presented significant spatial and inter annual variability from 2000 to 2018 fig 5 for the entire lake the pixel based cab varied widely from 112 42 mg chla in november 2016 to 166 85 mg chla in august 2012 with a long term mean of 128 74 mg chla s d 9 45 mg chla it was also shown in fig 5 that before 2010 the high mean pixel based cab was mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of western and eastern lake chaohu after 2010 the high pixel based cab of western lake chaohu gradually covered the whole lake area of the wl meanwhile the high value area of the el area also increased especially in the central part the long term mean values of pixel based cab for wl cl and el fig s3 were 131 43 mg chla s d 12 94 mg chla 126 31 mg chla s d 9 31 mg chla and 126 36 mg chla s d 7 87 mg chla respectively the pixel based cab for cl was generally the lowest among the three segments despite the consistently higher the pixel based cab for wl and el the pixel based cab for wl ranging from 111 28 mg in november 2016 to 204 07 mg in august 2012 varied much more dramatically than that in el ranging from 112 35 mg in december 2003 to 155 21 mg in september 2018 3 3 2 seasonal and monthly variations in pixel based cab there was strong seasonal variability in the pixel based cab for the entire lake fig 6 the pixel based cab values significantly increased in summer compared to those in winter mann kendall test p 0 01 and the mean values for the entire lake in summer and winter were 136 28 mg chla and 122 69 mg chla respectively the pixel based cab variations showed monthly spatial differences fig s4 the highest mean pixel based cab value 139 67 mg chla for the entire lake was found in august whereas the lowest mean pixel based cab value 117 86 mg chla appeared in december the areas with high algal biomass from april to october were mainly concentrated in the coast of western lake chaohu and those with high algal biomass from november to march were mainly distributed in the central and eastern lake chaohu time series of the seasonal averages of the modis derived pixel based cab values from 2000 to 2018 were constructed for the three segments and entire lake by spatially and temporally averaging all valid pixels over the waters of each part fig 7 seasonal pattern of the modis derived pixel based cab distribution in the three segments was generally similar to that in the entire lake showing higher values in summer and lower values in winter in terms of spatial distribution the highest pixel based cab values appeared in the wl while lower values were found in the cl and el 3 3 3 spatial distribution characterization of pixel based cab the modis derived pixel based cab from 2000 to 2018 was averaged to calculate the regional biomass distribution for lake chaohu fig 8 a the mean pixel based cab ranging from 112 42 to 166 85 mg chla was the highest in the wl especially its northern part followed by that in the el and it was the lowest in the cl the spatial distribution of the s d values was also formulated using the modis derived pixel based cab values between 2000 and 2018 fig 8b the s d value of the pixel based cab varied from 15 42 mg chla in the wl to 9 49 mg chla in the el with an average of 12 98 mg chla indicating a substantial spatial variation in the cab the variations in the pixel based cab for the wl were much larger than those for the other two segments of lake chaohu the annual growth rate of the pixel based cab for water area was 10 40 10 44 with an average of 1 92 fig 9 it was indicated that the areas with the fastest annual growth of pixel based cab were concentrated in the southern part of wl and the central parts of cl and el 3 3 4 spatial classification based on time series pixel based cab on the basis of the spatial and temporal distribution data of algal biomass in lake chaohu the spatial heterogeneity of algal abundance in lake chaohu was analyzed by unsupervised classification the whole lake area was divided into five zones zone i was mainly located near the nanfei river estuary which was seriously polluted fig 10 zone ii had relatively low pixel based cab which was mainly located in the cl and el zone iii covered the most part of wl and the north coast of el zone iv was the transitional area between zones iii and v of wl and zone v was mainly distributed in the coastal area of lake chaohu in addition the long term trend analysis of the five zones showed that the pixel based cab of zone v had a downward trend whereas the change of zone i was not significant and the three other types of zones showed an increasing trend seasonal and periodic characteristic analysis showed that although the five zones all showed bimodal periodic changes the specific time when peak and valley values occurred in the five zones were different among them the first two algal biomass peaks appeared earlier in zone iii than those in other zones whereas the second biomass peak of zone i appeared the latest and only the first biomass peak occurred just next to that of zone iii 3 4 sensitivity to climatic factors in order to further explore the effects of climatic factors on algal biomass the daily synchronous temperature wind speed and total cab were utilized to describe the yearly and monthly variation characteristics of correlation coefficient on the whole the total algal biomass increased significantly with the increase of temperature r 0 452 p 0 001 n 1387 but it was negatively correlated with wind speed r 0 236 p 0 001 n 1387 similar relationships were also observed between the total cab and temperature or wind speed every year fig 11 a besides the inter annual correlation coefficients between total cab and two climatic factors temperature and wind speed were relative steady without remarkable trends during 2000 2018 r2 0 106 p 0 174 r2 0 042 p 0 401 however monthly correlation coefficients between the total cab and temperature varied dramatically fig 11b the correlation coefficient between the total cab and temperature fluctuated between 0 2 and 0 4 except that in february july august and december the reason is that microcystis the dominant phytoplankton in lake chaohu begins recruitment at 11 c in spring and overwinter at 10 cwith an optimum growth temperature of 20 30 c yang et al 2020 the lower even negative correlation coefficients in these four months demonstrated that the photosynthetic activity and growth rate of phytoplankton can be repressed and even decreased below or above the optimum temperature mowe et al 2015 yang et al 2020 fig 12 shows that there was a significant positive correlation between pixel based cab and air temperature on different time scales and the correlation was enhanced with the increase of time scale for daily data the areas with high correlations were mainly located in the south coast downwind of the local prevailing wind direction in winter and spring nevertheless the correlation coefficient between the relative abundance of algae and air temperature in wl was not very high with the increase of time scale the correlation coefficient between total algae biomass and air temperature increased to more than 0 3 even exceeding 0 5 in the wl except for the areas around the route to the el air temperature has a significant effect on the change of algal biomass considering the delay of algae growth the change of pixel based algal biomass was more sensitive to the temperature change on the monthly and annual scales the wind driven flow is the main driving force of algae migration cao et al 2006 zhang et al 2021 even though wind is not a decisive factor for the growth of algae fig 12 reveals that there were significant spatial differences in the correlation between algal biomass in pixel column and wind speed on different time scales the analysis of daily data showed that 96 24 of algal biomass for the whole lake area was negatively correlated with wind speed their correlation turned from negative to positive with the increase of time scale and the monthly and annual algal biomass in the northeast bay of the wl and the southeast coast had a stronger positive correlation with the wind speed indicating that in the case of a higher wind speed the algae can accumulate in the downwind direction more easily and the pixel based algae biomass may be greater it should be noted that the average annual value contains much more details than the daily result and may even lead to the opposite findings in our opinion in short the wind changes rapidly which directly influences the short term spatial temporal redistribution of algal biomass the sensitivity of spatial temporal distribution of biomass to temperature and wind on different time scales demonstrated that climate change impacts on the lake ecosystem and its process in detail contributing to local pollution control ecological restoration and water source protection in lake chaohu 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of remote algal bloom area or surface biomass algal bloom area is one of the most traditional proxy for remote monitoring of phytoplankton biomass hu et al 2010 which is always used to explore lake ecosystem variation duan et al 2009 shi et al 2019 zhang et al 2016b the rapid vertical movement of caynobacteria can lead to dramatic changes in the estimation results of biomass from a single surface value hu et al 2021 lee et al 2012 for example during july 21 to 24 2011 the algal bloom area fluctuated between 13 31 km2 and 508 13 km2 with an average wind speed of 1 3 1 9 m s fig s5 however it was impossible for algae to have such drastic changes in biomass in just four days which had been confirmed by remote algae biomass ranging from 85 92 t chla 87 05 t chla long term comparison in fig 13 indicated that it seemed a certain correlation r 0 555 p 0 001 n 902 between algal bloom area and algal biomass in the water column yet their relationship was not one to one algal biomass in the water column showed better stability than that in areas as well as a certain phenological fluctuation due to constantly change of meteorological factors especially wind speed zhang et al 2021 the algal bloom area with drastic changes didn t show satisfied consistency with algal biomass in the water column algal biomass in water column was the basis of algal bloom formation so the algae bloom area on the water surface alone could not represent the total biomass in the whole water column in addition the dramatic change of algal bloom area could also hamper the understanding of lake ecosystem variation and its environmental driving factors and result in high risk of wrong judgment and decision making hu et al 2021 hence remote algal biomass instead of algal bloom area was recommended to reflect algae variations in water objectively furthermore previous studies on environmental driving forces based on algal bloom area should be re validated by algal biomass in water column next the algal biomass inside and outside euphotic zone of lake chaohu was compared quantitatively fig s6 overall for the whole lake chaohu the algal biomass outside the euphotic zone remained stable at 20 94 3 59 t chla whereas the algal biomass inside the euphotic zone showed acute changes with an average of 44 96 12 65 t chla the algal biomass in the euphotic zone accounted for 41 2 94 8 of the total algal biomass about 137 in situ chla profile data in lake chaohu were used to discuss the relationship between algal bloom biomass in the euphotic zone and on water surface within 0 5 m fig s6b it was indicated that when the vertical distribution of algae was uniform there was a linear relationship between the algal biomass however a complex relationship could also be detected which was closely related to the vertical heterogeneity of algae 4 2 action mechanisms of climatic factors on the cab variations previous studies suggested that variations in total phytoplankton biomass is possibly affected by several climatic factors such as temperature and wind besides nutrients and light conditions paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and paul 2012 shi et al 2015 whitton and potts 2000 some published studies showed that microcystis and anabaena are the dominant genera of bloom forming cyanobacteria in lake chaohu and aphanizomenon is the dominant genus occasionally in some south coast kong et al 2017 yu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a it was argued that cyanobacteria were favored by higher temperature r 0 452 p 0 001 n 1387 fig 11a indicating that higher temperature could promote the increase of the total cab rising temperature benefits phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria through several mechanisms first as the dominant phytoplankton in lake chaohu cyanobacteria generally grow better at higher temperatures i e 25 c so they are endowed with a competitive advantage at elevated temperatures paerl and paul 2012 paul 2008 whitton and potts 2000 yang et al 2020 second warming of surface waters is also associated with thermal stratification and changes in turbulent mixing that provide an environmental benefit to the buoyant cyanobacteria paerl and huisman 2008 whitton and potts 2000 third because of global warming earlier resuscitation in spring and later dormancy in winter lengthen the optimal growth periods of phytoplankton furthermore it has also been evidenced that a large number of cyanobacteria can give positive feedback by further increasing the water surface temperature through the intense absorption of light which consolidates the competitive advantage of buoyant cyanobacteria paerl and huisman 2008 wind appears to affect the total cab which is evident from the negative correlations between wind speed and total cab fig 11a although wind is not one of the three major factors affecting algae growth whitton and potts 2000 it can indirectly influence algae growth by affecting its growth environment for example sediment re suspension induced by wind force determines the light conditions subsequently causing high turbidity in turn the high turbidity reduces light availability and therefore decreases the intensity of phytoplankton bloom and total cab shi et al 2015 it is worth noting that spatial details of pixel based cab depend on the hydrodynamic situations of lakes affected by wind based on the daily data of wind speed and direction in lake chaohu since 2000 the dominant wind direction is the east wind 14 4 followed by the south wind 9 7 the average wind speed of different wind directions is 2 02 2 77 m s and that of the east wind is 2 67 m s in this study the scenario of the dominant wind direction and its average wind speed of 2 67 m s were selected to calculate the spatial distribution of 3d flow field and divergence distribution in lake chaohu by virtue of the pom model fig 14 a shows that the divergence of lake chaohu was generally low in the west basically negative and high in the east basically positive under the east wind the divergence of the inflow mouth of nanfei river wuli river and pai river was the lowest a section curve was selected from nanfei river estuary to lake chaohu gate to further analyze the relationship between the divergence and the spatial distribution of total algal biomass fig 14b the results of the divergence and the average total algal biomass in the section are presented in fig 14c from the nanfei river estuary to lake chaohu gate the divergence changed from 0 01 s 1 to 0 0035 s 1 whereas the pixel based cab decreased from 135 79 mg to 123 04 mg and there was a significant correlation between the divergence and pixel based cab r 0 77 p 0 01 n 60 thus the spatial distribution of divergence controlled by wind and lake bathymetry determines the spatial distribution of algal biomass in short climatic factors temperature and wind mainly influenced the total cab in water and the heterogeneity and spatial details of pixel based cab depended on the hydrodynamic situations of lakes affected by meteorological factors such as wind furthermore forecasting models for cyanobacterial blooms could benefit from meteorological factors such as air temperature and wind as prediction parameters shi et al 2017 according to the relationship between algal biomass and climatic factors during 2000 and 2018 when the wind speed is decreased by 0 1 and 0 5 m s the total algal biomass in lake chaohu will increase by 0 34 and 1 7 t chla respectively assuming that the water quality and other relevant elements are stable similarly when the temperature increases by 0 1 and 0 5 c the total algal biomass will increase by 0 05 and 0 26 t chla respectively in recent years total nitrogen total phosphorus and chla in lake chaohu has been increased significantly and water quality improvement has been slowed down while lake chaohu may face more severe challenges with the future climatic warming 4 3 implications for environmental management protecting drinking water and fisheries minimizing economic and ecosystem losses and protecting public health are the main objectives for algal bloom management shi et al 2019 scientific monitoring is the first critical step of environmental management to determine a scientific monitoring index and develop an effective monitoring method up to now algal bloom area has become one of the most traditional proxies for algal bloom management hu et al 2010 but its drastic changes often bring some confusion to the prediction and decision making of algal bloom it is strongly recommended that the algal biomass in the water column instead of algal bloom area can be regarded as a new algal bloom index our study results clearly demonstrated that the total algal biomass in lake chaohu have significantly increased and influenced by climatic factors despite a variety of pollution control measures taken moreover the combination of algal biomass and ecological model could further improve the accuracy of algal bloom prediction becoming an important support for early warning of phytoplankton bloom in lake chaohu in a broader perspective the approach of remote algal biomass in the water column proposed here can be used as a template to reduce cost and increase management efficiency and it may be extended to many other inland eutrophic lakes with frequent algal blooms once the remote algorithm parameters of algal biomass are calibrated using related local data and the new satellite derived biomass products are validated similar long term dynamics can be derived the efficient and cost effective satellite derived biomass products can provide continuous and long term assessment as well as immediate value and useful decision support tools for other inland lake waters therefore it is recommended in this study that remote algal biomass in the water column should be considered in future eutrophic lake monitoring to aid in the interpretation of spatial and temporal patterns of important water quality parameters and the evaluation of the risk early warning of algal blooms 5 conclusion remote sensing techniques were used to address cab dynamics and its environmental drivers in lake chaohu a typical eutrophic lake with frequent algal blooms in china first long term cab in the water column were obtained from modis observations gathered from 2000 to 2018 based on a remote cab model of hu hu et al 2021 second the long term daily total cab for lake chaohu fluctuated between 48 2 and 118 6 t chla with an increasing rate of 0 569 t chla y the total cab for lake chaohu varied considerably in space and time with high values in the wl and el and with a lower value in the cl the total biomass in summer and autumn were found to be significantly higher than that in spring and winter the highest mean total cab 82 14 t chla for the entire lake was found in august whereas the lowest mean value 59 45 t chla appeared in december third the responses of cab dynamics to climatic conditions and hydrodynamic situations were analyzed based on modis derived cab data the results indicated that high temperature and low wind speed can promote the growth of total cab for the whole lake the sensitivity of cab dynamics to climatic conditions was found to vary by region and time scale the spatial details depended on the hydrodynamic situations of lakes affected by meteorological factors wind etc and the divergence convergence processes in the fluid medium determined the spatial

16476,the lack of access to water and sanitation services wss of a considerable share of the world population has been challenging the international community for decades the proposal of the millennium development goals and later on the sustainable development goals sdgs by the united nations un intended to act as a blueprint to achieve a more equitable future for all and in the case of wss ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all sdg 6 however the current global pandemic further emphasised the importance of wss given the increasing asymmetries faced by billions worldwide and the gaps between high income and low and middle income nations for this reason understanding whether low and middle income countries have been approximating towards or deviating from the sdg 6 is crucial to derive and communicate key information for the sake of improved public governance and political decision making in this paper we extend a state of the art methodology based on data envelopment analysis for assessing the convergence of the low and middle income un member states regarding the sdg 6 between 2016 and 2017 we find that on average not only did the member states converge by decreasing the performance spread and the gap between the best and worst practice frontiers but also the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources was the indicator in which the majority exhibited the worst performances in the end we derive possible policy implications which as our results show are aligned with the recent un reports on the subject keywords water and sanitation services sustainable development governance convergence data envelopment analysis 1 introduction water and sanitation services wss table 1 contains all abbreviations used in the paper are a fundamental component of public health and basic living standards to the point where their global comprehensive and long term viable universalisation constitutes one of the most crucial struggles of the 21st century as a matter of fact the technological progress in this sector over the recent decades has been tremendous despite the lack of access of a considerable percentage of the world population to basic wss thus these inequalities remain as a multidimensional challenge for the international community castro and heller 2009 whose difficulties in reaching a consensus regarding the inalienability of that human right have been hampering possible solutions for this reason in terms of wss the proposal of the millennium development goals mdgs and later on the sustainable development goals sdgs by the united nations un sought to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all however in a world plagued by a global pandemic covid 19 further emphasised the importance of wss in the prevention and containment of its spread given the vital role that water plays in attaining no poverty zero hunger and good health and well being for instance as well as the balance of all life on earth according to the un 2020 before covid 19 not only billions lacked wss with 2 2 billion people lacking safely managed drinking water and 4 2 billion people lacking safely managed sanitation but also two in five healthcare facilities lacked basic hand hygiene equipment indeed according to the same report the un disclosed that the pandemic revealed that 3 billion people around the world lacked hand washing facilities at home even more worrying is the un s prediction that by 2030 water scarcity could displace 700 million people in general the organisation also claims that some countries are experiencing gaps of up to 61 for achieving wss targets nonetheless the challenges faced by wss worldwide do not seem to be caused by technology or natural constraints but rather by a governance crisis ballabh 2008 grigg 2010 derived from poor financial management economic regulation and drafted legislation in fact as a set of traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised world bank 1992 governance implies that countries should promote economic and financial stability to the point where social inequalities can be dealt with iribarnegaray and seghezzo 2012 together with sustainable development their combined idea results in an adjustment of traditional governance structures to ensure that social development proceeds along a sustainable trajectory meadowcroft et al 2005 needless to say the efficiency of wss is linked to poverty and disease which in turn amplify social and economic retrogression guerrant et al 2013 nevertheless providing universal coverage of these services arises as the solution for populations with severe inequalities in the access to water and sanitation typically found in low and middle income nations cetrulo et al 2019 thus the role that international organisations such as the un play with their sdgs has a tremendous influence in these countries given the global impact of their goals indeed committing to global agendas eases the homogenisation of public policies and influences local governance ferreira et al 2021 although some improvements in wss were being made before the pandemic un 2020 the absence of adequate wss exposes the structural fragility of a system which can induce a myriad of diseases despite the international effort to bridge the gaps in wss between high and low and middle income countries herrera 2019 there are still important asymmetries mainly due to social and economic aspects adelodun et al 2021 hence understanding whether low and middle income countries have been approximating towards or deviating from i e converging towards or diverging from the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is fundamental therefore this paper proposes a benchmarking exercise that makes use of a state of the art technique to assess the convergence of the un s low and middle income member states regarding the targets of the sdg 6 based on the available data 2016 and 2017 we extend the methodology proposed by pereira et al 2021b to account for the positions of countries on the efficient frontiers according to different technologies in the assessed periods considering a multi desirable multi undesirable output mdmuo setting this allows a more detailed computation of convergence as well as a more informative communication of results given the composite indicator ci nature of the performance assessment furthermore to the best of the authors knowledge there are no similar applications to the un s sdg 6 this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the literature review that legitimises this work section 3 described the advocated methodology section 4 details the setting section 5 exhibits the results of the convergence analysis section 6 discusses those results and derives some policy implications section 7 concludes the paper by putting forward the main achievements limitations and research prospects 2 knowledge gap economically the notion of convergence in this scope concerns the catch up effect of countries with a low or middle income with countries with a high income over time romer 1994 on that account two concepts of convergence can be derived from this idea σ convergence which refers to the extent of productivity dispersion among countries and β convergence which refers to the extent that countries with a low or middle income were able to increase their productivity in comparison to countries with a high income barro and sala i martin 1992 since σ convergence and β convergence are typically measured using econometric methods and a single productivity measure such as the per capita income research towards multi input multi output settings allows a more thorough perception of this subject however in the real world desirable and undesirable inputs and outputs are frequent particularly in performance assessment contexts where inputs are assumed to be unitary for example in wss performance assessments we may have an output related to existence of adequate sanitation facilities for which higher values correspond to better performances and an output related to the presence of pollutants in water for which lower values correspond to better performances thus when evaluating convergence based on performance assessments considering a mdmuo setting is crucial this is particularly applicable in sectors of public interest among which those that play an important role in achieving sustainable development outcomes pereira et al 2021b paved the way for the evaluation of convergence based on performance assessments in a mdmuo setting via cis generated by means of the popular benefit of the doubt bod approach zanella et al 2015 which itself is based on the non parametric operational research method of data envelopment analysis dea to estimate production frontiers first as powerful informative tools cis aid in decision making through their ability to aggregate interpret and communicate individual indicators nardo et al 2008 the environmental performance index emerson et al 2012 the climate change performance index burck et al 2012 and the human development index hdi united nations 2013 are examples of broadly accepted cis second the bod approach developed by cherchye et al 2007 is a dea based method whose recent extensions zanella et al 2015 enable the inclusion of desirable and undesirable outputs simultaneously examples of bod applications are found in areas as varied as research effectiveness to compare the weighting schemes of bod with a similar non parametric model karagiannis and paschalidou 2017 local government to study the efficiency of tuscan

pereira et al 2021a and public health to propose an index combining the concepts of public health and sustainable development pereira and marques 2021 at last dea which is also the most used non parametric technique in wss performance assessments berg and marques 2011 finds its share of applications in the wss sector with the works of de witte and marques 2010 in understanding the effects of

storto 2020 in measuring the efficiency of water utilities in italy among the myriad of applications enumerated above it is clear that despite their validity and credibility none of them are aimed at studying the worldwide convergence of the low income un member states towards the sdg 6 indeed as far as the authors are aware applications of bod models for generating cis or dea based models for studying convergence in the sector are non existent as are such applications to the un s sdg 6 3 methodology σ convergence indicates the evolution of the dispersion of performances surrounding the best practice frontier bpf the estimated empirical production frontier containing the best performing decision making units dmus according to as many dimensions as there are indicators in the assessment four in this particular case over time here a value lower than one denotes divergence whereas a value greater than one denotes convergence as for β convergence the dynamics of dmus located on the bpf and the worst practice frontier wpf are evaluated where a value lower than one denotes convergence and a value greater than one denotes divergence both share the meaning of constancy when they are equal to one naturally these concepts are related still only by deconstructing them can we truly grasp their meaning on the one hand in terms of σ convergence the exploration of the dispersion tendency of a global performance measure across several dmus in a mdmuo setting over time using bod ci models has been introduced by pereira et al 2021b indeed the authors rest their reasoning on the directional distance functions ddfs of chambers et al 1996 recognised as a generalisation of shephard 1970 distance function specifications whose directional vector has positive and negative components associated with desirable and undesirable outputs respectively by converting the directional bod ci score into a 0 1 metric a value equal to one denotes that a dmu is located on the bpf consequently the average of the sample corresponds to the global performance spread let us consider n dmus applying x i j r m inputs to produce y r j r s desirable outputs and b k j r l undesirable outputs following the proposition of chung et al 1997 expression 1 presents the general formulation of the ddf for technology s x b y x produce b and y 1 d x b y g b g y max β x b β g b y β g y s where g b and g y are the components of the directional vector g g b g y that indicate the direction of change for undesirable and desirable outputs respectively subsequently the distances to the bpf can be estimated assuming constant returns to scale using the multiplier dea formulation detailed in model 2 2 d min r 1 s u r y r j 0 k 1 l p k b k j 0 v subject to r 1 s u r g y k 1 l p k g b 1 r 1 s u r y r j k 1 l p k b k j v 0 j 1 n u r ε r 1 s p k ε k 1 l v 0 where u r and p k are the weights associated with the desirable and undesirable outputs v is the weight associated with the dummy input y r j 0 and b k j 0 are the values of dmu j 0 in the desirable and undesirable indicators and ε is a non archimedean note that the components of the directional vector coincide with their respective values for dmu j 0 such that g g b g y b k j 0 y r j 0 which enables a proportional interpretation of the ci scores given that inputs are seen as a dummy variable in bod frameworks the true equivalence between this ddf with a directional vector g x y and the radial efficiency score of dea is given by expression 3 boussemart et al 2003 3 b b y 1 d x b y b y 1 d x b y b y furthermore the efficiency change e c t t 1 component of the malmquist index färe et al 1992 in expression 4 4 b t 1 b t 1 y t 1 b t b t y t e c t t 1 returns the ratio between the radial efficiency scores in two successive periods accordingly the value of the σ convergence for all dmus in the sample is formulated as 5 σ convergence j 1 n e c j t t 1 1 n as in horta and camanho 2015 note that despite the performance assessment nature of this study we still adopted the e c notation for the sake of mathematical familiarity however here it refers to the performance change rather than the traditional efficiency change on the other hand in terms of β convergence the analysis of the dmus mobility located on the bpf and the wpf in a mdmuo setting using bod ci models can also be established in the work of pereira et al 2021b by following the same reasoning based on ddfs the distance from a certain dmu to the wpf is computed by expression 6 6 i x b y g b g y max β x b β g b y β g y p m i n where p min constitutes the minimum performance level of the sample hence the distances to the wpf can be estimated by model 7 in a similar yet inverted fashion to model 2 7 i max r 1 s u r y r j 0 k 1 l p k b k j 0 v subject to r 1 s u r g y k 1 l p k g b 1 r 1 s u r y r j k 1 l p k b k j v 0 j 1 n u r ε r 1 s p k ε k 1 l v 0 as a matter of fact for a directional vector now defined as g g b g y b k j 0 y r j 0 the radial efficiency score conversion is formulated as 8 w b y 1 i x b y b y 1 i x b y b y where w b y is in 1 however extending the work of pereira et al 2021b we propose the additional assessment of the movements between the bpf and the wpf considering the positions of the dmu both in periods t and t 1 for this reason the distance between the bpf and the wpf d b w evaluated for the position of dmu j 0 in two successive periods t and t 1 can be measured by expression 9 and expression 10 respectively 9 d b w t b t b t y t b t 1 b t y t w t b t y t w t 1 b t y t 10 d b w t 1 b t b t 1 y t 1 b t 1 b t 1 y t 1 w t b t 1 y t 1 w t 1 b t 1 y t 1 therefore the distance between the bpf and the wpf in t and t 1 d b w t t 1 can be computed as the geometric mean of the distances between the two frontiers evaluated at the position of dmu j 0 in t and t 1 as shown in expression 11 11 d b w t t 1 b t b t y t b t 1 b t y t b t b t 1 y t 1 b t 1 b t 1 y t 1 1 2 w t b t y t w t 1 b t y t w t b t 1 y t 1 w t 1 b t 1 y t 1 1 2 t c t t 1 w p c t t 1 where t c t t 1 is the technological change component of the malmquist index färe et al 1992 and w p c t t 1 is the worst practice change horta and camanho 2015 similarly as σ convergence the value of β convergence for the sample under analysis can be determined by 12 β convergence j 1 n t c t t 1 w p c t t 1 1 n j 1 n t c t t 1 1 n j 1 n w p c t t 1 1 n a t c t t 1 a w p c t t 1 where a t c t t 1 represents the average technological change and a w p c t t 1 represents the average worst practice change between t and t 1 horta and camanho 2015 at last these models were implemented using matlab version r2020a software together with ibm ilog cplex optimisation studio version 12 8 optimisation package bear in mind that appendix a contains an illustrative example explaining the metrics proposed above 4 setting first the indicators must be chosen according to bartram et al 2018 the eight targets of the united nations sdg 6 can be grouped into outcome and means of implementation targets each of these targets is measured by one to two indicators whose data can be obtained via the un water interagency mechanism s data portal at https www sdg6data org corresponding to the available years of 2016 and 2017 there are also data from 2000 to 2015 but they concern the mdgs from the initial set of indicators we excluded 1 6 3 1 due to the absence of data in the un water data portal 2 6 3 2 6 4 1 6 5 1 6 5 2 6 6 1 and 6 b 1 due to having more than 25 of missing data in at least one year in the end four targets and four indicators remained see table 2 among which three are desirable 6 1 1 6 2 1 and 6 a 1 and one is undesirable 6 4 2 second in line with keeney 1992 building the dmu set is the next logical step among the one hundred and ninety three un member states one hundred and twenty three were selected which resulted from the exclusion of thirty six high income countries and thirty four potential dmus given the fact that the latter had more than 25 of missing data in at least one year furthermore the un 2020 also categorises its member states in terms of regional groupings viz sub saharan africa comprising 46 member states northern africa and western asia comprising 15 member states central and southern asia comprising 13 member states eastern and south eastern asia comprising 12 member states latin america and the caribbean comprising 28 member states oceania comprising 2 member states and europe and northern america comprising 7 member states note that although we analyse the member states using a single worldwide frontier regarding all of them we also explore convergence regionally based on the results obtained from the global frontier i e the regional results concern the worldwide frontier and not separate regional metafrontiers this is due to the limited number of dmus in some regions that prevent the generation of acceptable regional metafrontiers due to dea dimensionality issues finally table 3 presents the main descriptive statistics of the selected indicators according to the available dmus note that at first sight the lower average from 2016 to 2017 points to a decrease in all indicators despite the increase of the standard deviation in almost all indicators apart from y 2 5 results the analysis of the convergence of the low and middle income un member states according to the targets of the sdg 6 between 2016 and 2017 returned the values displayed in table 4 an alternative view of the results is presented in tables 5 and 6 keep in mind that σ convergence greater than one denotes a decreasing performance gap and β convergence lower than one denotes a decreasing gap between the bpf and the wpf worldwide the un member states have managed to decrease the performance gap among themselves and significantly decreased the gap between the bpf and the wpf regionally only the member states in the eastern and south eastern asia regional grouping increased the performance spread among their peers furthermore this regional grouping was the only one that contained member states that exhibited an increase in the gap between the bpf and the wpf in terms of the β convergence components it is clear that the member states of the sub saharan africa regional grouping were the only ones to have technological and worst practice improvements the countries in the regional groupings of oceania and europe and northern america showed technological constancy but improved the wpf from 2016 to 2017 the remaining groupings contained member states that exhibited technological regression alongside an improvement in their respective distance to the wpf note that the nations belonging to the eastern and south eastern regional grouping were the only ones with technological and worst practice regression a geographical analysis of the results is crucial to understand in more detail the individual and regional locations of the performance changes bear in mind that for all these measures a score greater than one indicates improvement towards achieving the un s sdg 6 additionally note that the member states in grey colour depict those that are not part of our sample first fig 1 shows the performance change of each un member state from 2016 to 2017 although it is not immediately clear that the majority of the member states has a performance change greater than or equal to one the fact is that nations with a performance change much greater than one overshadow this finding as a matter of fact among the one hundred and four member states with a performance change greater than or equal to one five central african republic eritrea egypt morocco and pakistan have had a tremendous performance improvement from 2016 to 2017 nonetheless nineteen member states revealed a performance change lower than one with one mauritania displaying worrying performance regression i e performance change much lower than one second fig 2 shows the technological change of each un member state from 2016 to 2017 here the standard deviation was significantly lower than in the previous measure since the vast majority of the member states revealed technological constancy on the one hand the results showed that approximately 17 of the member states revealed technological regression a technological change lower than one with egypt morocco afghanistan and indonesia being the ones with a technological change much lower than one on the other hand approximately 25 of the nations experienced technological progress a technological change greater than one with djibouti being the one with a technological change much greater than one third fig 3 shows the worst practice change of each un member state from 2016 to 2017 surprisingly or not approximately 69 of the member states displayed the signs of improving their distance to the wpf due to a worst practice change greater than one angola benin botswana burkina faso burundi cabo

belarus the republic of moldova and ukraine revealed the greatest improvement given their worst practice change much greater than one on the contrary armenia egypt georgia jordan turkey pakistan uzbekistan cambodia china myanmar viet nam bolivia the plurinational state of brazil costa rica dominican republic ecuador el salvador honduras mexico paraguay bosnia and herzegovina north macedonia and serbia exhibited an increase in the distance to the wpf due to their worst practice change much lower than one at last on the one hand a separate analysis on the indicators in 2016 highlights the amount of water and sanitation related official development assistance that is part of a government coordinated spending plan y 3 as the indicator in which more member states were efficient and whose performances were higher on average followed closely by the proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services y 1 and the proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services including a hand washing facility with soap and water y 2 on the other hand the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources b 1 was by far the indicator in which fewer member states were efficient and whose performances were lower on average similar findings were ascertained from 2017 with the exception that the proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services y 1 became the indicator in which more member states were efficient and whose performances were higher on average 6 discussion and policy implications globally it is safe to say that the low and middle income un member states converged in all senses regarding the sdg 6 from 2016 to 2017 since the worldwide performance assessments revealed that both the performance gap and the gap between the bpf and the wpf decreased this result may find an explanation in the progressive role that private operators play in managing the wss in low and middle income countries with better performances as well as the existence of economies of scale in wss in large low and middle income countries cetrulo et al 2020 2019 the fact that plenty of member states have a worst practice change much greater than one denotes this evolution nevertheless the inequalities in wss coverage are still a reality due to the fact that the countries with the least coverage receive less official development assistance per capita than countries with more extensive wss coverage cha et al 2017 in essence the low and middle income member states should still be the aim of increased attention from the international community with a focus on stronger political engagement towards funding targeting wss coverage this is particularly true in countries from regions where their respective countries diverged in the sense of σ eastern and south eastern asia thus increasing the performance spread among them in fact in this regional grouping no nation showed a performance change greater than one and cambodia china myanmar and vietnam emerged as the ones with a worst practice change much lower than one while indonesia displayed a technological change much lower than one which means that these countries significantly increased their gap between the bpf and the wpf in terms of wss performance from 2016 to 2017 these results are aligned with the insufficient funding available to achieve the sdg6 s targets and meet countries needs united nations 2020 moreover on the one hand even if headey and palloni 2019 claim that improved access to wss is not statistically significant to increase many desirable outputs and reduce undesirable outputs such improvements lead to improvements in child health and development and reductions in waterborne diseases for instance these advances may also help to explain the global worldwide convergence pointed out by the results on the other hand the relationship between these results and the aforementioned factors can be further discussed by means of statistical correlation tests actually we have attempted to correlate the values of performance change technological change and worst practice change of each un member state with its corresponding value in terms of eleven correlation indicators c t with t 1 11 see table 7 1 the well known hdi components sdg3 s life expectancy at birth c 1 sdg4 s expected years of schooling c 2 and mean years of schooling c 3 and sdg8 s gross national income per capita c 4 2 the world bank s worldwide governance indicators voice and accountability c 5 political stability and absence of violence c 6 government effectiveness c 7 regulatory quality c 8 rule of law c 9 and control of corruption c 10 3 the existence of a wss regulatory entity c 11 among the eleven indicators we found a vast majority of very weak positive or negative correlation instances but only two instances that differed from the rest the performance change weak negative correlation with the life expectancy at birth 0 2126 and the expected years of schooling 0 2470 indeed as expected moving closer to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all clashes with the low values that low and middle income countries exhibit in terms of life expectancy at birth and expected years of schooling since both these indicators denote the asymmetries that those nations experience while improving their wss performance besides note that the performance change is close to presenting weak negative correlations with government effectiveness and rule of law which again can be explained by the fact that performance improvements have evolved in the face of the lack of adequate political leadership additionally the technological change is on the limit of displaying a weak negative correlation with the expected years of schooling which is also expected since the technological progress that some member states show is counterbalanced by the average low performances on this indicator regarding regulatory quality and the existence of a wss regulatory entity it is clear that there are very weak correlations with all convergence components except a negative one with the performance change given the fact that our sample only contained low and middle income countries whose majority does not have a significant regulatory quality however note that more than 67 of the countries that have a wss regulatory entity displayed a worst practice change greater than one while those that do not have such an entity never revealed efficiency technological or worst practice change improvements this means that low and middle income nations that have a wss regulatory entity tend to converge towards the un s sdg 6 from another angle on the one hand the higher performance of the un member states regarding the amount of water and sanitation related official development assistance that is part of a government coordinated spending plan y 3 can be derived from key wss policy drivers such as donor prioritisation and collective action this can be explained by more accurate and adequate economic social environmental trade offs and synergies of water supply constraints and their corresponding policy implications zhao et al 2021 on the other hand the lower performance of those member states regarding the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources b 1 can find an explanation in key wss policy barriers such as the lack of land dwellings tenure status and the lack of coordinated policy making and legal frameworks sinharoy et al 2019 which follow the findings of the un 2020 furthermore mraz et al 2021 also point out that policy making should also concern water pathogens and not only indicator organisms in the indicators operationalising the sdg 6 targets otherwise reaching it will be more challenging due to the false sense of safety given by the non inclusion of important factors hence while a higher proportion of the population gained access to safely managed drinking water services a lower percentage seems to have been unable to adequately improve its access to safely managed sanitation services including a hand washing facility with soap and water this is particularly worrying in the current pandemic context and in line with the un 2020 since closing the gaps in water sanitation and hygiene is fundamental to contain the spread of covid 19 therefore as suggested by sinharoy et al 2019 top down e g donor agendas and government urban development policies and bottom up e g community mobilisation and advocacy approaches are seen as possible coordinated multi sectoral efforts to tackle these disparities 7 conclusion by conducting a convergence analysis based on performance assessments over time considering a mdmuo setting we were able to understand if the low and middle income un member states were moving towards the sdg 6 indeed resting on a state of the art methodology we have studied the efficiency change the technological change and the worst practice change of one hundred and twenty three nations between 2016 and 2017 taking into account their positions regarding the efficient frontier in distinct periods and technologies the worldwide assessment carried out in this research pointed out that globally between 2016 and 2017 the un member states have converged in the sense of σ and β i e they have simultaneously decreased the performance spread and the gap between the bpf and the wpf respectively furthermore when considering the un regional groupings only the member states in the eastern and south eastern asia one were not σ and β convergent with all groupings containing β convergent member states on average the latter was achieved by a tremendous improvement in the wpf alongside a slight decrease in the bpf in the member states of most regional groupings except three sub saharan africa which managed to also improve its average technological change and oceania and europe and northern america which maintained their average technological change constant but increased their average worst practice change additionally on an individual basis several member states have had major changes from 2016 to 2017 namely efficiency changes central african republic eritrea egypt morocco and pakistan technological changes djibouti worst practice changes angola benin botswana burkina faso burundi cabo verde cameroon chad comoros congo cȳte d ivoire the democratic republic of the congo djibouti eswatini ethiopia gabon gambia ghana guinea guinea bissau kenya lesotho liberia malawi mauritania namibia niger rwanda sao tome and principe sierra leone somalia south africa south sudan togo uganda the united republic of tanzania zimbabwe algeria azerbaijan sudan the syrian arab republic tunisia yemen bhutan iran the islamic republic of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan mongolia philippines timor leste belize cuba grenada guatemala guyana haiti jamaica panama saint lucia suriname papua new guinea belarus the republic of moldova and ukraine furthermore the better performances of the un member states regarding the amount of water and sanitation related official development assistance that is part of a government coordinated spending plan clash with their worse performances regarding the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources although key wss policy drivers and barriers may justify these findings top down and bottom up approaches arise as possible solutions for decreasing the stress of water levels additionally these improved performances may be explained by the role played by the existence of wss regulatory entities private operators and economies of scale in some of the low and middle income countries analysed here however the results also point to the possibility of insufficient funding available to achieve the sdg6 s targets and meet the countries needs in essence we are not there yet but we are getting closer in terms of limitations the absence of data regarding several indicators and the un member states in the un water database hindered the application of our methodology the derivation of more accurate findings and the framing of the big picture of wss sustainability indeed in the future research prospects should mainly focus on incorporating data from more sdg 6 indicators as well as data from more years and un member states in order to study the evolution of pairwise convergence over time and better represent the actual situation of the wws sustainability declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we would like to thank again fct for supporting this research via the ph d scholarship sfrh bd 149283 2019 we would also like to leave a word of appreciation to the three anonymous referees for their inestimable insights that improved earlier versions of this paper our views and any errors are our own responsibility appendix a simulation of the proposed methodology under defined conditions to allow an easier understanding of the concepts behind the models described in section 3 an illustrative example adapted from pereira et al 2021b is depicted below here we consider eight dmus producing one desirable and one undesirable output whose computation of d and i between periods t and t 1 is shown in table a 8 table a 9 presents the results of the efficiency scores between both periods at last table a 10 depicts the convergence values of each dmu which are graphically portrayed in fig a 4 that shows that the bpf in solid line and the wpf in dashed line improved from period t to t 1 but the latter improved at a higher rate than the former additionally the performance spread increased therefore both σ and β convergence are lower than one since the dmus departed from the bpf but the gap between both frontiers decreased from one period to the other to grasp the aim of an inefficient dmu towards efficiency inefficient dmu d contains a directional vector in green colour indicating the movement it should follow to reach the efficient frontier 
16476,the lack of access to water and sanitation services wss of a considerable share of the world population has been challenging the international community for decades the proposal of the millennium development goals and later on the sustainable development goals sdgs by the united nations un intended to act as a blueprint to achieve a more equitable future for all and in the case of wss ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all sdg 6 however the current global pandemic further emphasised the importance of wss given the increasing asymmetries faced by billions worldwide and the gaps between high income and low and middle income nations for this reason understanding whether low and middle income countries have been approximating towards or deviating from the sdg 6 is crucial to derive and communicate key information for the sake of improved public governance and political decision making in this paper we extend a state of the art methodology based on data envelopment analysis for assessing the convergence of the low and middle income un member states regarding the sdg 6 between 2016 and 2017 we find that on average not only did the member states converge by decreasing the performance spread and the gap between the best and worst practice frontiers but also the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources was the indicator in which the majority exhibited the worst performances in the end we derive possible policy implications which as our results show are aligned with the recent un reports on the subject keywords water and sanitation services sustainable development governance convergence data envelopment analysis 1 introduction water and sanitation services wss table 1 contains all abbreviations used in the paper are a fundamental component of public health and basic living standards to the point where their global comprehensive and long term viable universalisation constitutes one of the most crucial struggles of the 21st century as a matter of fact the technological progress in this sector over the recent decades has been tremendous despite the lack of access of a considerable percentage of the world population to basic wss thus these inequalities remain as a multidimensional challenge for the international community castro and heller 2009 whose difficulties in reaching a consensus regarding the inalienability of that human right have been hampering possible solutions for this reason in terms of wss the proposal of the millennium development goals mdgs and later on the sustainable development goals sdgs by the united nations un sought to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all however in a world plagued by a global pandemic covid 19 further emphasised the importance of wss in the prevention and containment of its spread given the vital role that water plays in attaining no poverty zero hunger and good health and well being for instance as well as the balance of all life on earth according to the un 2020 before covid 19 not only billions lacked wss with 2 2 billion people lacking safely managed drinking water and 4 2 billion people lacking safely managed sanitation but also two in five healthcare facilities lacked basic hand hygiene equipment indeed according to the same report the un disclosed that the pandemic revealed that 3 billion people around the world lacked hand washing facilities at home even more worrying is the un s prediction that by 2030 water scarcity could displace 700 million people in general the organisation also claims that some countries are experiencing gaps of up to 61 for achieving wss targets nonetheless the challenges faced by wss worldwide do not seem to be caused by technology or natural constraints but rather by a governance crisis ballabh 2008 grigg 2010 derived from poor financial management economic regulation and drafted legislation in fact as a set of traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised world bank 1992 governance implies that countries should promote economic and financial stability to the point where social inequalities can be dealt with iribarnegaray and seghezzo 2012 together with sustainable development their combined idea results in an adjustment of traditional governance structures to ensure that social development proceeds along a sustainable trajectory meadowcroft et al 2005 needless to say the efficiency of wss is linked to poverty and disease which in turn amplify social and economic retrogression guerrant et al 2013 nevertheless providing universal coverage of these services arises as the solution for populations with severe inequalities in the access to water and sanitation typically found in low and middle income nations cetrulo et al 2019 thus the role that international organisations such as the un play with their sdgs has a tremendous influence in these countries given the global impact of their goals indeed committing to global agendas eases the homogenisation of public policies and influences local governance ferreira et al 2021 although some improvements in wss were being made before the pandemic un 2020 the absence of adequate wss exposes the structural fragility of a system which can induce a myriad of diseases despite the international effort to bridge the gaps in wss between high and low and middle income countries herrera 2019 there are still important asymmetries mainly due to social and economic aspects adelodun et al 2021 hence understanding whether low and middle income countries have been approximating towards or deviating from i e converging towards or diverging from the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is fundamental therefore this paper proposes a benchmarking exercise that makes use of a state of the art technique to assess the convergence of the un s low and middle income member states regarding the targets of the sdg 6 based on the available data 2016 and 2017 we extend the methodology proposed by pereira et al 2021b to account for the positions of countries on the efficient frontiers according to different technologies in the assessed periods considering a multi desirable multi undesirable output mdmuo setting this allows a more detailed computation of convergence as well as a more informative communication of results given the composite indicator ci nature of the performance assessment furthermore to the best of the authors knowledge there are no similar applications to the un s sdg 6 this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the literature review that legitimises this work section 3 described the advocated methodology section 4 details the setting section 5 exhibits the results of the convergence analysis section 6 discusses those results and derives some policy implications section 7 concludes the paper by putting forward the main achievements limitations and research prospects 2 knowledge gap economically the notion of convergence in this scope concerns the catch up effect of countries with a low or middle income with countries with a high income over time romer 1994 on that account two concepts of convergence can be derived from this idea σ convergence which refers to the extent of productivity dispersion among countries and β convergence which refers to the extent that countries with a low or middle income were able to increase their productivity in comparison to countries with a high income barro and sala i martin 1992 since σ convergence and β convergence are typically measured using econometric methods and a single productivity measure such as the per capita income research towards multi input multi output settings allows a more thorough perception of this subject however in the real world desirable and undesirable inputs and outputs are frequent particularly in performance assessment contexts where inputs are assumed to be unitary for example in wss performance assessments we may have an output related to existence of adequate sanitation facilities for which higher values correspond to better performances and an output related to the presence of pollutants in water for which lower values correspond to better performances thus when evaluating convergence based on performance assessments considering a mdmuo setting is crucial this is particularly applicable in sectors of public interest among which those that play an important role in achieving sustainable development outcomes pereira et al 2021b paved the way for the evaluation of convergence based on performance assessments in a mdmuo setting via cis generated by means of the popular benefit of the doubt bod approach zanella et al 2015 which itself is based on the non parametric operational research method of data envelopment analysis dea to estimate production frontiers first as powerful informative tools cis aid in decision making through their ability to aggregate interpret and communicate individual indicators nardo et al 2008 the environmental performance index emerson et al 2012 the climate change performance index burck et al 2012 and the human development index hdi united nations 2013 are examples of broadly accepted cis second the bod approach developed by cherchye et al 2007 is a dea based method whose recent extensions zanella et al 2015 enable the inclusion of desirable and undesirable outputs simultaneously examples of bod applications are found in areas as varied as research effectiveness to compare the weighting schemes of bod with a similar non parametric model karagiannis and paschalidou 2017 local government to study the efficiency of tuscan

storto 2020 in measuring the efficiency of water utilities in italy among the myriad of applications enumerated above it is clear that despite their validity and credibility none of them are aimed at studying the worldwide convergence of the low income un member states towards the sdg 6 indeed as far as the authors are aware applications of bod models for generating cis or dea based models for studying convergence in the sector are non existent as are such applications to the un s sdg 6 3 methodology σ convergence indicates the evolution of the dispersion of performances surrounding the best practice frontier bpf the estimated empirical production frontier containing the best performing decision making units dmus according to as many dimensions as there are indicators in the assessment four in this particular case over time here a value lower than one denotes divergence whereas a value greater than one denotes convergence as for β convergence the dynamics of dmus located on the bpf and the worst practice frontier wpf are evaluated where a value lower than one denotes convergence and a value greater than one denotes divergence both share the meaning of constancy when they are equal to one naturally these concepts are related still only by deconstructing them can we truly grasp their meaning on the one hand in terms of σ convergence the exploration of the dispersion tendency of a global performance measure across several dmus in a mdmuo setting over time using bod ci models has been introduced by pereira et al 2021b indeed the authors rest their reasoning on the directional distance functions ddfs of chambers et al 1996 recognised as a generalisation of shephard 1970 distance function specifications whose directional vector has positive and negative components associated with desirable and undesirable outputs respectively by converting the directional bod ci score into a 0 1 metric a value equal to one denotes that a dmu is located on the bpf consequently the average of the sample corresponds to the global performance spread let us consider n dmus applying x i j r m inputs to produce y r j r s desirable outputs and b k j r l undesirable outputs following the proposition of chung et al 1997 expression 1 presents the general formulation of the ddf for technology s x b y x produce b and y 1 d x b y g b g y max β x b β g b y β g y s where g b and g y are the components of the directional vector g g b g y that indicate the direction of change for undesirable and desirable outputs respectively subsequently the distances to the bpf can be estimated assuming constant returns to scale using the multiplier dea formulation detailed in model 2 2 d min r 1 s u r y r j 0 k 1 l p k b k j 0 v subject to r 1 s u r g y k 1 l p k g b 1 r 1 s u r y r j k 1 l p k b k j v 0 j 1 n u r ε r 1 s p k ε k 1 l v 0 where u r and p k are the weights associated with the desirable and undesirable outputs v is the weight associated with the dummy input y r j 0 and b k j 0 are the values of dmu j 0 in the desirable and undesirable indicators and ε is a non archimedean note that the components of the directional vector coincide with their respective values for dmu j 0 such that g g b g y b k j 0 y r j 0 which enables a proportional interpretation of the ci scores given that inputs are seen as a dummy variable in bod frameworks the true equivalence between this ddf with a directional vector g x y and the radial efficiency score of dea is given by expression 3 boussemart et al 2003 3 b b y 1 d x b y b y 1 d x b y b y furthermore the efficiency change e c t t 1 component of the malmquist index färe et al 1992 in expression 4 4 b t 1 b t 1 y t 1 b t b t y t e c t t 1 returns the ratio between the radial efficiency scores in two successive periods accordingly the value of the σ convergence for all dmus in the sample is formulated as 5 σ convergence j 1 n e c j t t 1 1 n as in horta and camanho 2015 note that despite the performance assessment nature of this study we still adopted the e c notation for the sake of mathematical familiarity however here it refers to the performance change rather than the traditional efficiency change on the other hand in terms of β convergence the analysis of the dmus mobility located on the bpf and the wpf in a mdmuo setting using bod ci models can also be established in the work of pereira et al 2021b by following the same reasoning based on ddfs the distance from a certain dmu to the wpf is computed by expression 6 6 i x b y g b g y max β x b β g b y β g y p m i n where p min constitutes the minimum performance level of the sample hence the distances to the wpf can be estimated by model 7 in a similar yet inverted fashion to model 2 7 i max r 1 s u r y r j 0 k 1 l p k b k j 0 v subject to r 1 s u r g y k 1 l p k g b 1 r 1 s u r y r j k 1 l p k b k j v 0 j 1 n u r ε r 1 s p k ε k 1 l v 0 as a matter of fact for a directional vector now defined as g g b g y b k j 0 y r j 0 the radial efficiency score conversion is formulated as 8 w b y 1 i x b y b y 1 i x b y b y where w b y is in 1 however extending the work of pereira et al 2021b we propose the additional assessment of the movements between the bpf and the wpf considering the positions of the dmu both in periods t and t 1 for this reason the distance between the bpf and the wpf d b w evaluated for the position of dmu j 0 in two successive periods t and t 1 can be measured by expression 9 and expression 10 respectively 9 d b w t b t b t y t b t 1 b t y t w t b t y t w t 1 b t y t 10 d b w t 1 b t b t 1 y t 1 b t 1 b t 1 y t 1 w t b t 1 y t 1 w t 1 b t 1 y t 1 therefore the distance between the bpf and the wpf in t and t 1 d b w t t 1 can be computed as the geometric mean of the distances between the two frontiers evaluated at the position of dmu j 0 in t and t 1 as shown in expression 11 11 d b w t t 1 b t b t y t b t 1 b t y t b t b t 1 y t 1 b t 1 b t 1 y t 1 1 2 w t b t y t w t 1 b t y t w t b t 1 y t 1 w t 1 b t 1 y t 1 1 2 t c t t 1 w p c t t 1 where t c t t 1 is the technological change component of the malmquist index färe et al 1992 and w p c t t 1 is the worst practice change

camanho 2015 at last these models were implemented using matlab version r2020a software together with ibm ilog cplex optimisation studio version 12 8 optimisation package bear in mind that appendix a contains an illustrative example explaining the metrics proposed above 4 setting first the indicators must be chosen according to bartram et al 2018 the eight targets of the united nations sdg 6 can be grouped into outcome and means of implementation targets each of these targets is measured by one to two indicators whose data can be obtained via the un water interagency mechanism s data portal at https www sdg6data org corresponding to the available years of 2016 and 2017 there are also data from 2000 to 2015 but they concern the mdgs from the initial set of indicators we excluded 1 6 3 1 due to the absence of data in the un water data portal 2 6 3 2 6 4 1 6 5 1 6 5 2 6 6 1 and 6 b 1 due to having more than 25 of missing data in at least one year in the end four targets and four indicators remained see table 2 among which three are desirable 6 1 1 6 2 1 and 6 a 1 and one is undesirable 6 4 2 second in line with keeney 1992 building the dmu set is the next logical step among the one hundred and ninety three un member states one hundred and twenty three were selected which resulted from the exclusion of thirty six high income countries and thirty four potential dmus given the fact that the latter had more than 25 of missing data in at least one year furthermore the un 2020 also categorises its member states in terms of regional groupings viz sub saharan africa comprising 46 member states northern africa and western asia comprising 15 member states central and southern asia comprising 13 member states eastern and south eastern asia comprising 12 member states latin america and the caribbean comprising 28 member states oceania comprising 2 member states and europe and northern america comprising 7 member states note that although we analyse the member states using a single worldwide frontier regarding all of them we also explore convergence regionally based on the results obtained from the global frontier i e the regional results concern the worldwide frontier and not separate regional metafrontiers this is due to the limited number of dmus in some regions that prevent the generation of acceptable regional metafrontiers due to dea dimensionality issues finally table 3 presents the main descriptive statistics of the selected indicators according to the available dmus note that at first sight the lower average from 2016 to 2017 points to a decrease in all indicators despite the increase of the standard deviation in almost all indicators apart from y 2 5 results the analysis of the convergence of the low and middle income un member states according to the targets of the sdg 6 between 2016 and 2017 returned the values displayed in table 4 an alternative view of the results is presented in tables 5 and 6 keep in mind that σ convergence greater than one denotes a decreasing performance gap and β convergence lower than one denotes a decreasing gap between the bpf and the wpf worldwide the un member states have managed to decrease the performance gap among themselves and significantly decreased the gap between the bpf and the wpf regionally only the member states in the eastern and south eastern asia regional grouping increased the performance spread among their peers furthermore this regional grouping was the only one that contained member states that exhibited an increase in the gap between the bpf and the wpf in terms of the β convergence components it is clear that the member states of the sub saharan africa regional grouping were the only ones to have technological and worst practice improvements the countries in the regional groupings of oceania and europe and northern america showed technological constancy but improved the wpf from 2016 to 2017 the remaining groupings contained member states that exhibited technological regression alongside an improvement in their respective distance to the wpf note that the nations belonging to the eastern and south eastern regional grouping were the only ones with technological and worst practice regression a geographical analysis of the results is crucial to understand in more detail the individual and regional locations of the performance changes bear in mind that for all these measures a score greater than one indicates improvement towards achieving the un s sdg 6 additionally note that the member states in grey colour depict those that are not part of our sample first fig 1 shows the performance change of each un member state from 2016 to 2017 although it is not immediately clear that the majority of the member states has a performance change greater than or equal to one the fact is that nations with a performance change much greater than one overshadow this finding as a matter of fact among the one hundred and four member states with a performance change greater than or equal to one five central african republic eritrea egypt morocco and pakistan have had a tremendous performance improvement from 2016 to 2017 nonetheless nineteen member states revealed a performance change lower than one with one mauritania displaying worrying performance regression i e performance change much lower than one second fig 2 shows the technological change of each un member state from 2016 to 2017 here the standard deviation was significantly lower than in the previous measure since the vast majority of the member states revealed technological constancy on the one hand the results showed that approximately 17 of the member states revealed technological regression a technological change lower than one with egypt morocco afghanistan and indonesia being the ones with a technological change much lower than one on the other hand approximately 25 of the nations experienced technological progress a technological change greater than one with djibouti being the one with a technological change much greater than one third fig 3 shows the worst practice change of each un member state from 2016 to 2017 surprisingly or not approximately 69 of the member states displayed the signs of improving their distance to the wpf due to a worst practice change greater than one angola benin botswana burkina faso burundi cabo

uzbekistan cambodia china myanmar viet nam bolivia the plurinational state of brazil costa rica dominican republic ecuador el salvador honduras mexico paraguay bosnia and herzegovina north macedonia and serbia exhibited an increase in the distance to the wpf due to their worst practice change much lower than one at last on the one hand a separate analysis on the indicators in 2016 highlights the amount of water and sanitation related official development assistance that is part of a government coordinated spending plan y 3 as the indicator in which more member states were efficient and whose performances were higher on average followed closely by the proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services y 1 and the proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services including a hand washing facility with soap and water y 2 on the other hand the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources b 1 was by far the indicator in which fewer member states were efficient and whose performances were lower on average similar findings were ascertained from 2017 with the exception that the proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services y 1 became the indicator in which more member states were efficient and whose performances were higher on average 6 discussion and policy implications globally it is safe to say that the low and middle income un member states converged in all senses regarding the sdg 6 from 2016 to 2017 since the worldwide performance assessments revealed that both the performance gap and the gap between the bpf and the wpf decreased this result may find an explanation in the progressive role that private operators play in managing the wss in low and middle income countries with better performances as well as the existence of economies of scale in wss in large low and middle income countries cetrulo et al 2020 2019 the fact that plenty of member states have a worst practice change much greater than one denotes this evolution nevertheless the inequalities in wss coverage are still a reality due to the fact that the countries with the least coverage receive less official development assistance per capita than countries with more extensive wss coverage cha et al 2017 in essence the low and middle income member states should still be the aim of increased attention from the international community with a focus on stronger political engagement towards funding targeting wss coverage this is particularly true in countries from regions where their respective countries diverged in the sense of σ eastern and south eastern asia thus increasing the performance spread among them in fact in this regional grouping no nation showed a performance change greater than one and cambodia china myanmar and vietnam emerged as the ones with a worst practice change much lower than one while indonesia displayed a technological change much lower than one which means that these countries significantly increased their gap between the bpf and the wpf in terms of wss performance from 2016 to 2017 these results are aligned with the insufficient funding available to achieve the sdg6 s targets and meet countries needs united nations 2020 moreover on the one hand even if headey and palloni 2019 claim that improved access to wss is not statistically significant to increase many desirable outputs and reduce undesirable outputs such improvements lead to improvements in child health and development and reductions in waterborne diseases for instance these advances may also help to explain the global worldwide convergence pointed out by the results on the other hand the relationship between these results and the aforementioned factors can be further discussed by means of statistical correlation tests actually we have attempted to correlate the values of performance change technological change and worst practice change of each un member state with its corresponding value in terms of eleven correlation indicators c t with t 1 11 see table 7 1 the well known hdi components sdg3 s life expectancy at birth c 1 sdg4 s expected years of schooling c 2 and mean years of schooling c 3 and sdg8 s gross national income per capita c 4 2 the world bank s worldwide governance indicators voice and accountability c 5 political stability and absence of violence c 6 government effectiveness c 7 regulatory quality c 8 rule of law c 9 and control of corruption c 10 3 the existence of a wss regulatory entity c 11 among the eleven indicators we found a vast majority of very weak positive or negative correlation instances but only two instances that differed from the rest the performance change weak negative correlation with the life expectancy at birth 0 2126 and the expected years of schooling 0 2470 indeed as expected moving closer to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all clashes with the low values that low and middle income countries exhibit in terms of life expectancy at birth and expected years of schooling since both these indicators denote the asymmetries that those nations experience while improving their wss performance besides note that the performance change is close to presenting weak negative correlations with government effectiveness and rule of law which again can be explained by the fact that performance improvements have evolved in the face of the lack of adequate political leadership additionally the technological change is on the limit of displaying a weak negative correlation with the expected years of schooling which is also expected since the technological progress that some member states show is counterbalanced by the average low performances on this indicator regarding regulatory quality and the existence of a wss regulatory entity it is clear that there are very weak correlations with all convergence components except a negative one with the performance change given the fact that our sample only contained low and middle income countries whose majority does not have a significant regulatory quality however note that more than 67 of the countries that have a wss regulatory entity displayed a worst practice change greater than one while those that do not have such an entity never revealed efficiency technological or worst practice change improvements this means that low and middle income nations that have a wss regulatory entity tend to converge towards the un s sdg 6 from another angle on the one hand the higher performance of the un member states regarding the amount of water and sanitation related official development assistance that is part of a government coordinated spending plan y 3 can be derived from key wss policy drivers such as donor prioritisation and collective action this can be explained by more accurate and adequate economic social environmental trade offs and synergies of water supply constraints and their corresponding policy implications zhao et al 2021 on the other hand the lower performance of those member states regarding the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources b 1 can find an explanation in key wss policy barriers such as the lack of land dwellings tenure status and the lack of coordinated policy making and legal frameworks sinharoy et al 2019 which follow the findings of the un 2020 furthermore mraz et al 2021 also point out that policy making should also concern water pathogens and not only indicator organisms in the indicators operationalising the sdg 6 targets otherwise reaching it will be more challenging due to the false sense of safety given by the non inclusion of important factors hence while a higher proportion of the population gained access to safely managed drinking water services a lower percentage seems to have been unable to adequately improve its access to safely managed sanitation services including a hand washing facility with soap and water this is particularly worrying in the current pandemic context and in line with the un 2020 since closing the gaps in water sanitation and hygiene is fundamental to contain the spread of covid 19 therefore as suggested by sinharoy et al 2019 top down e g donor agendas and government urban development policies and bottom up e g community mobilisation and advocacy approaches are seen as possible coordinated multi sectoral efforts to tackle these disparities 7 conclusion by conducting a convergence analysis based on performance assessments over time considering a mdmuo setting we were able to understand if the low and middle income un member states were moving towards the sdg 6 indeed resting on a state of the art methodology we have studied the efficiency change the technological change and the worst practice change of one hundred and twenty three nations between 2016 and 2017 taking into account their positions regarding the efficient frontier in distinct periods and technologies the worldwide assessment carried out in this research pointed out that globally between 2016 and 2017 the un member states have converged in the sense of σ and β i e they have simultaneously decreased the performance spread and the gap between the bpf and the wpf respectively furthermore when considering the un regional groupings only the member states in the eastern and south eastern asia one were not σ and β convergent with all groupings containing β convergent member states on average the latter was achieved by a tremendous improvement in the wpf alongside a slight decrease in the bpf in the member states of most regional groupings except three sub saharan africa which managed to also improve its average technological change and oceania and europe and northern america which maintained their average technological change constant but increased their average worst practice change additionally on an individual basis several member states have had major changes from 2016 to 2017 namely efficiency changes central african republic eritrea egypt morocco and pakistan technological changes djibouti worst practice changes angola benin botswana burkina faso burundi cabo verde cameroon chad comoros congo cȳte d ivoire the democratic republic of the congo djibouti eswatini ethiopia gabon gambia ghana guinea guinea bissau kenya lesotho liberia malawi mauritania namibia niger rwanda sao tome and principe sierra leone somalia south africa south sudan togo uganda the united republic of tanzania zimbabwe algeria azerbaijan sudan the syrian arab republic tunisia yemen bhutan iran the islamic republic of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan mongolia philippines timor leste belize cuba grenada guatemala guyana haiti jamaica panama saint lucia suriname papua new guinea belarus the republic of moldova and ukraine furthermore the better performances of the un member states regarding the amount of water and sanitation related official development assistance that is part of a government coordinated spending plan clash with their worse performances regarding the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources although key wss policy drivers and barriers may justify these findings top down and bottom up approaches arise as possible solutions for decreasing the stress of water levels additionally these improved performances may be explained by the role played by the existence of wss regulatory entities private operators and economies of scale in some of the low and middle income countries analysed here however the results also point to the possibility of insufficient funding available to achieve the sdg6 s targets and meet the countries needs in essence we are not there yet but we are getting closer in terms of limitations the absence of data regarding several indicators and the un member states in the un water database hindered the application of our methodology the derivation of more accurate findings and the framing of the big picture of wss sustainability indeed in the future research prospects should mainly focus on incorporating data from more sdg 6 indicators as well as data from more years and un member states in order to study the evolution of pairwise convergence over time and better represent the actual situation of the wws sustainability declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we would like to thank again fct for supporting this research via the ph d scholarship sfrh bd 149283 2019 we would also like to leave a word of appreciation to the three anonymous referees for their inestimable insights that improved earlier versions of this paper our views and any errors are our own responsibility appendix a simulation of the proposed methodology under defined conditions to allow an easier understanding of the concepts behind the models described in section 3 an illustrative example adapted from pereira et al 2021b is depicted below here we consider eight dmus producing one desirable and one undesirable output whose computation of d and i between periods t and t 1 is shown in table a 8 table a 9 presents the results of the efficiency scores between both periods at last table a 10 depicts the convergence values of each dmu which are graphically portrayed in fig a 4 that shows that the bpf in solid line and the wpf in dashed line improved from period t to t 1 but the latter improved at a higher rate than the former additionally the performance spread increased therefore both σ and β convergence are lower than one since the dmus departed from the bpf but the gap between both frontiers decreased from one period to the other to grasp the aim of an inefficient dmu towards efficiency inefficient dmu d contains a directional vector in green colour indicating the movement it should follow to reach the efficient frontier 
16477,the combination of a low dose of coagulant with a ballast that can inactive phosphorus p in lake sediment a technique known as flock and lock is one method for restoration of eutrophic lakes the effectiveness of a drinking water treatment residual dwtr as a ballast in flock and lock was assessed using assays of eutrophic lake water from thailand dominated by microcystis aeruginosa cyanobacteria colonies by measuring changes in chlorophyll a ph and zeta potential p sorption isotherms were developed from long term batch equilibrium experiments desorption of nutrients and metals was assessed via leaching experiments and morphological changes to cellular structure were assessed using scanning electron microscopy results showed that combining dwtr with a low dose of aluminum sulfate 0 6 4 0 mg al l effectively sank 74 96 of microcystis with dwtr dose 50 400 mg l initial chlorophyll a concentration 92 976 µg l ph 7 4 9 3 and alkalinity 99 108 ppm caco3 identified as factors significantly associated with sinking efficacy p sorption capacity of the dwtr 7 12 mg g was significantly higher than a local soil 0 33 mg g enabling the dwtr to inactivate p in lake sediment desorption of al fe ca and n from the dwtr was estimated to contribute to a marginal increase in concentrations of those compounds in the water column of a small shallow lake 1 2 0 66 53 4 and 0 07 µg

restoration 1 introduction harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria are becoming increasingly frequent in freshwater lakes as a result of human activities that excessively enrich lakes with the nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p huisman et al 2018 these types of blooms are problematic because they can disrupt the ecosystem ibelings et al 2007 negatively affect the local economy dodds et al 2009 generate anoxic conditions that result in foul odors and fish kills pan et al 2011 and produce high levels of cyanotoxins díez quijada et al 2019 cyanotoxins are a diverse group of metabolites acutely toxic to humans and livestock dreher et al 2019 huang and zimba 2019 pouria et al 1998 and long term exposure has been associated with chronic diseases svirčev et al 2017 increased agricultural intensity urbanization and climate change are expected to further increase the incidence of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater lakes and reservoirs paerl 2018 reduction and prevention of harmful cyanobacterial blooms is a common priority in water resources management huisman et al 2018 the most critical strategy to achieve this goal and reverse eutrophication is to reduce external and internal sources of p carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2016 however in many cases it is also necessary to remove the existing cyanobacterial bloom from the water column to accelerate the lake restoration process lürling and mucci 2020 bloom management strategies include algicides dziga et al 2018 physical removal atkins et al 2001 biomanipulation macário et al 2021 and the combination of a coagulant with a ballast to precipitate cyanobacteria from the water column in an approach known as flock and sink de lucena silva et al 2019 however without immobilizing the potentially available p in the water column and lake sediment recurrence of blooms is likely li et al 2019 therefore precipitation of cyanobacterial blooms via a combination of a low dose of coagulant with a solid phase p fixative known as flock and lock has been proposed to address this shortcoming lürling and van oosterhout 2013 as such flock and lock not only removes positively buoyant cyanobacteria from the water column but also addresses internal p loading by inactivating historically accumulated legacy p in lake sediment lürling et al 2020a several materials have been identified for use in flock and lock including chitosan modified local soils lss pan et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 aluminum modified zeolites noyma et al 2017 and lanthanum modified bentonites lmbs miranda et al 2017 noyma et al 2016 van oosterhout and lürling 2011 waajen et al 2016 to date lmbs remain the most commonly used material in flock and lock lürling et al 2020a however the feasibility of lmbs and other modified materials is limited by the need to chemically modify them in order to increase the p sorption capacity which increases production costs de magalhaes et al 2019 spears et al 2013 furthermore lmbs can significantly increase the concentration of lanthanum in macrophytes water and food chains of treated lakes van oosterhout et al 2020 therefore alternative p fixing ballast materials that are safe effective and economical should be sought drinking water treatment residuals dwtrs which are a sludge waste product produced from the sedimentation process of drinking water production turner et al 2019 could potentially serve as a ballast in flock and lock recycled dwtrs have been developed as adsorbents for heavy metals lian et al 2020 nutrients wang et al 2021b and organic pollutants punamiya et al 2013 in particular dwtrs have a high p sorption capacity al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 the amorphous aluminum al or iron fe minerals often present in dwtrs from chemical coagulants added during water treatment facilitate effective and selective p sorption mechanisms yang et al 2006 therefore many reuse pathways exist for dwtrs that utilize this p sorption quality turner et al 2019 including as a soil amendment to treat stormwater soleimanifar et al 2016 as a bed for constructed wetlands babatunde et al 2010 as a sorbent in fixed column treatment of eutrophic lake water wang et al 2018a and as a sorbent to inactivate p in lake sediment wang et al 2013a using dwtrs in lake restoration projects also has the added benefit of cost and energy savings compared to producing new coagulants or modified clays xu et al 2016b the primary criticism of dwtrs has been the potential for metals and to a greater extent n to leach from dwtrs ichihara and nishio 2013 however several pre treatment options have been identified for successful reduction in the leachability of nutrients and metals in dwtrs including oxygen limited heat wang et al 2016 in situ aging agyin birikorang and o connor 2009 intermittent aeration wang et al 2018b and washing wang et al 2019 furthermore studies of ecological and human health risks of pre treated dwtrs have shown acceptably low risk in lake restoration applications yuan et al 2020 2017 2016b therefore because dwtrs often have an inherently high p sorption capacity they present a promising alternative to existing materials for the flock and lock technique the purpose of this study was to assess the potential of using dwtrs as a ballast in the flock and lock approach to lake restoration the objectives were to determine the effectiveness of a dwtr in sinking colonies of positively buoyant cyanobacteria relative to a ls control identify factors that affect removal efficacy and estimate what amount of nutrients and metals would be released from a hypothetical dose based on the p sorption capacity of the dwtr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water sampling lake water used for experimentation was collected from beung nong khot

switzerland alkalinity using colorimetry hanna hi775 and cell counts using a hemocytometer with compound microscope to identify predominant species 2 2 preparation and characterization of ballasts a composite sample of dewatered dwtr 20 30 kg was collected from five locations of a dewatering lagoon that received sludge generated during cleaning operations of the sedimentation tank of a drinking water treatment plant the plant which has a typical output of 5600 m3 hr of potable water treated surface water collected from the pong river thailand using polyaluminum chloride occasionally combined with aluminum sulfate alum as a coagulant a second ballast a sandy loam ls was obtained from ubon racthcatani province 15 7 21 n 104 55 19 e and used for comparison against the dwtr both ballasts were transported directly to the laboratory where they were washed by mixing with deionized water at a 1 1 w v ratio for 10 minutes after allowing the solids to settle the supernatant was carefully removed this washing cycle was repeated three times after which the remaining ballast sludge was oven dried at 110 c for 48 hours before being ground and sieved through 180 mesh 90 µm these ballasts were referred to as washed ls w ls and washed dwtr w dwtr a portion of each washed ballast was then treated using a muffle furnace isolab laborgeräte gmbh germany under oxygen limited conditions at 550 c for 10 hours the resulting ballasts were referred to as heat treated ls h ls and heat treated dwtr h dwtr all four ballasts were analyzed using the brunauer emmett teller bet adsorption desorption

a combination of ballast and or low dose coagulant was added to lake water containing cyanobacteria were used to test removal efficacy when using dwtr as a ballast alum al2 so4 3 18h2o commonly used by the provincial waterworks authority was obtained from a water supply retailer and used as a coagulant only h dwtr was used in the assays because oxygen limited treatment has been shown to improve the adsorptive properties of dwtr wang et al 2016 and reduce leaching of n wang et al 2018a for comparison purposes assays using h ls were also conducted the assay experiments followed procedures reported in a previous study thongdam et al 2021 briefly 250 ml of lake water was first placed into plastic graduated cylinders if coagulant was added to the assay the appropriate volume of a concentrated alum solution was added to the 250 ml aliquots in order to obtain the optimized al concentration which was determined using preliminary jar tests 1 hr if ballast was added it was gently mixed 5 10 sec with a glass rod and then left stagnant after one hour water samples 40 ml were taken from the top and bottom of the cylinders and analyzed for zeta potential malvern zetasizer nano malvern united kingdom morphological changes to algal cells using sem chlorophyll a and ph two experimental rounds of flock and sink assays were conducted fig 1 in the first round a single lake water sample was used the effect of the flock and sink treatment using h dwtr was evaluated against comparable treatment with h ls four different concentrations of ballast 50 100 200 and 400 mg l were tested for each ballast in addition several controls were run including ballast only controls alum only controls and no treatment controls the treatments were run in triplicate while the ballast only controls were run in duplicate the second experimental round used only h dwtr and two lake water samples multiple dilutions of each sample were created resulting in six more combinations of initial alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentrations in addition to round 1 dilutions were created by diluting with lake water that had been filtered with a 0 45 µm glass fiber membrane filter to remove chlorophyll biomass without substantially altering ph or alkalinity controls consisting of no treatment and alum only treatment were included as well fig 1 the effect of lake water quality alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentration and treatment factors ballast dose and optimized alum dose on the sinking efficacy of h dwtr were then statistically assessed see section 2 6 below 2 4 phosphorus sorption batch experiments sorption experiments were conducted to determine the maximum p sorption capacity of the two ballasts in the batch experiments 50 mg of dried ballast was added to 15 ml centrifuge tubes and filled with 10 ml of orthophosphate solution created from a sigma aldrich h2po4 phosphate 1000 mg po4 l or 326 mg p l standard solution dilutions of the standard solution 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 300 mg p l were created using deionized water the solution and dried ballast were thoroughly mixed in the centrifuge tubes by shaking and then left stagnant in the dark 30 days each tube was shaken for 10 seconds once per day to resuspend the solids after 30 days the tubes were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 minutes the amount of p sorbed to the ballast was determined indirectly from the reduction of p in the solution as determined by spectrophotometry 880 nm using the ascorbic acid method each batch was conducted in triplicate a two surface langmuir isotherm in nonlinear form with a modification to account for native p desorption kuster et al 2021 was then fitted to the data eq 1 1 q b 1 k 1 c 1 k 1 c b 2 k 2 c 1 k 2 c b 1 k 1 c 0 1 k 1 c 0 b 2 k 2 c 0 1 k 2

affinity p sorption capacities k1 and k2 are constants related to the high and low affinity binding energies of p sorption and c0 v0 and m0 are the aqueous concentration of p following equilibrium aqueous solution volume and mass of dwtr added in the batch in which zero p was added respectively the values for parameters b1 b2 k1 and k2 were determined by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals using the generalized reduced gradient solver within microsoft excel spreadsheet bolster and hornberger 2007 nash sutcliffe model efficiency measure e was also computed to assess goodness of fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 the maximum p sorption capacity b of each ballast was determined as the sum of b1 and b2 2 5 desorption experiments desorption or leaching experiments n 2 were conducted on h ls and h dwtr to estimate the potential for release of nutrients and metals to the surface water during flock and lock application the processed ballasts were mixed with 250 ml of deionized water by adding 12 5 g of pre treated ballast to erlenmeyer flasks 1 20 w v ratio then shaken on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm for 6 h at room temperature 23 c ichihara and nishio 2013 wang et al 2019 the suspension was decanted and filtered through 0 45 µm fiber filters the filtered water was analyzed for ammonia nh3 n tkn nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n using the kjeldahl method with mercury as a catalyst and for total p orthophosphate al ca fe mg mn and zn using icp oes following standard methods 2 6 statistical analysis two variables were computed from the analytical results of the flock and sink assays first weighted zeta potential in mv was computed as the average of the top and bottom zeta potentials weighted based on top and bottom chlorophyll a concentrations second removal efficacy as was computed as the percentage decrease in top chlorophyll a from the no treatment control for the given experiment differences in top chlorophyll a concentration weighted zeta potential and ph were each statistically compared between treatment groups using separate one way analysis of variance anova tests between group differences were assessed using tukey s post hoc comparison using a significance level of 0 05 these analyses were conducted on data collected from the first experimental round a multiple linear regression mlr model was used to assess factors associated with the removal efficacy of chlorophyll a using h dwtr in flock and sink treatment data from rounds 1 h dwtr only and 2 were used six continuous variables initial chlorophyll a concentration initial alkalinity initial ph optimized alum dose post alum ph and h dwtr dose were assessed for their linearity with removal efficacy graphical inspection showed h dwtr needed to be log transformed thus the natural log of h dwtr dose was used in the analysis the initial model was generated with forced entry of all variables variables were removed due to covariance or statistical insignificance to create the final model analyses were performed in stata 14 statacorp 2015 2 7 hypothetical dose calculation to evaluate the feasibility and water quality impact of using h dwtr as a ballast in flock and lock a theoretical dose necessary to inactivate sediment p was determined for a lake with a surface area of 18 5000 m2 and volume of 34 040 m3 which is nearby to this study s experimental lake kuster et al 2020 briefly the total recommended al dose for that lake was 102 g al m2 55 mg al l based on the targeted pool of potentially releasable p pl 9 285 g p m2 and binding efficiency ratio by weight for al p ral 11 g al g p the hypothetical full dose of h dwtr db mg l was computed based on eq 2 which determined how much dwtr was needed to inactivate the targeted sediment p pool pl after accounting for the low dose of coagulant added eq 2 is as follows 2 d b r b p l n d c v a r a l where pl is the targeted p pool in the sediment g p m2 v is the volume of the lake m3 a is the surface area of the lake m2 and rb g dwtr g p is the assumed binding efficiency ratio of the dwtr ballast to p by weight rb was computed as the inverse of the p sorption capacity the full dwtr dose was the sum of n sub doses each of which were combined with a dose of coagulant dc mg al l 3 results 3 1 characterization of lake water and ballasts initial analysis of the sampled lake water table 1 showed that the water used in the flock and sink assays was hypereutrophic carlson trophic index 89 98 carlson 1977 the dominant genus of cyanobacteria present was microcystis accounting for greater than 99 7 of cyanobacterial population based on cell counts two species were identified as microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii no other organisms were present in quantities substantial enough to be identified the h dwtr had a reddish orange color fig 2 a sem imaging showed rough surfaces and a porous structure the h ls had a pale brown color with smoother particle surfaces in sem imaging fig 2b analysis of the adsorption desorption isotherms and hysteresis loops fig s1 in supplementary information indicated that the h dwtr had a physical structure consistent with a porous powder and interconnected micropores thommes et al 2015 the h ls on the other hand was entirely macroporous with no micropores accordingly the h dwtr had a higher langmuir ssa 80 m2 g and total pore volume compared to the h ls 4 0 m2 g table 2 the h dwtr also contained slightly smaller particles d60 11 9 µm compared to the h ls d60 17 0 µm the heat treatment did not substantially alter the physical structure of the materials as the adsorption desorption isotherms and data reduction parameters were very similar between the washed and heated materials table 2 and fig s1 the most abundant minerals in both the ls and dwtr were al and calcium ca table 3 heat treatment however altered the chemical composition of the ballasts carbon nitrogen and hydrogen contents were reduced while the concentration of the most abundant metals generally increased in both ballasts al increased substantially by 80 to 135 as a result of the oxygen limited heat treatment other metals such as ca fe and magnesium mg increased slightly in the h dwtr and declined slightly in the h ls 3 2 effect of ballast type and ballast dose on top chlorophyll ph and zeta potential when the study lake water initial chlorophyll a concentration of 485 µg l round 1 was treated with a low dose of alum 2 mg al l alone the positively buoyant cyanobacterial biomass flocculated and accumulated at the top of the experimental cylinders at an average concentration of more than 2800 µg l which was higher than the no treatment control fig 3 a on the other hand if a low dose 50 100 mg l of ballast either h ls or h dwtr was added to the experimental cylinders alone the top chlorophyll a concentration was similar to the no treatment control fig 3b with no difference in results between the two ballasts at the highest dose of ballast alone 400 mg l approximately half the cyanobacteria sank nearly equal concentrations at the top and bottom of the cylinders with lower concentrations of chlorophyll a in the top of the cylinders treated with h dwtr compared to those treated with h ls however when a low dose of alum was combined with a ballast the cyanobacteria overwhelmingly sank fig 3c in the combination experiments the concentration of chlorophyll a at the bottom of the cylinders increased with increasing dose of ballast while the top chlorophyll a concentrations showed only slight differences across the different ballast doses and ballast types one way anova confirmed that top chlorophyll a was different among the experimental groups f19 36 7019 p 0 001 tukey s post hoc comparison identified eight homogenous groups of top chlorophyll a concentration fig 3 one way anova also indicated that the bottom chlorophyll a was different among the experimental groups f19 36 18 900 p 0 001 with tukey s post hoc comparison identifying 13 groups fig 3 generally the presence of alum and ballast were factors significantly associated with improved sinking of microcystis cyanobacteria h dwtr was also shown to be significantly better at sinking cyanobacteria especially at higher doses the addition of 2 mg al l of alum alone reduced the average ph from 8 03 to 7 44 fig 3a the ph in the ballast only treatments was similar to the no treatment control and the ph in the combination treatments was similar to the alum only control one way anova confirmed that ph was different among the groups f19 36 24 6 p 0 001 tukey s post hoc comparison identified that the ph was significantly lower in the treatments that included alum ballast type or dose did not affect ph finally the weighted zeta potential was similar across all treatments one way anova confirmed that no statistically significant differences existed in weighted zeta potential f19 36 1 57 p 0 12 3 3 water quality factors affecting sinking efficacy of dwtr the sinking efficacy in flock and sink assays using seven different experimental combinations of initial ph alkalinity and chlorophyll a concentration again showed that sinking efficacy increased with increased dose of h dwtr fig 4 however the percentage of cyanobacteria that precipitated to the bottom varied between 74 and 96 depending on water quality and h dwtr dose the optimized alum dose required to maximize flocculation of cyanobacteria was also different for each of the conditions comparing removal efficacy among the samples and fitting the mlr model to the data showed the relationship of each water quality parameter to removal efficacy the final mlr model adjusted r2 0 89 identified four factors initial alkalinity initial chlorophyll a initial ph and h dwtr dose log transformed as significantly associated with the removal efficacy of chlorophyll a table 4 the h dwtr dose on a logarithmic scale was positively associated with chlorophyll a removal i e the higher the dose the higher the proportion of chlorophyll a was removed during flock and sink application however the other three factors which were inherent properties of the original lake water ph alkalinity and chlorophyll a concentration were negatively associated with removal efficacy thus at equivalent h dwtr doses the removal efficacy was reduced as the initial alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentration in the lake water increased 3 4 morphological changes to agal cell structure sem images of microcystis colonies following application of the optimized dose of alum 2 mg al l and various concentrations of h dwtr showed no substantial morphological changes to cellular structure of the cyanobacteria pocks deformation or rupturing were not visible in the sem images following combined coagulant and ballast dosing from 50 to 400 mg l fig 5 similarly the microcystis cells were morphologically unchanged following the application of h ls in flock and sink or following the application of either h dwtr or h ls ballasts alone figs s2 s4 in supplementary information 3 5 phosphorus binding capacity of ballasts the maximum p sorption capacities of h ls and h dwtr were 0 33 mg p g and 7 12 mg p g respectively table 5 the bulk of the sorption capacity of the h dwtr was derived from the low affinity sorption capacity b2 the modeled p sorption fig 6 using the two surface langmuir isotherm showed very good agreement for both ballasts nash sutcliffe model efficiency 0 995 3 6 desorption of metals and nitrogen from ballasts results from the leaching experiments showed that the highest desorption rates on a per mass basis were observed for ca in both the h ls and h dwtr table 6 the equivalent of 162 4 mg kg of ca leached from h dwtr accounting for less than 0 5 of the original ca mass in the h dwtr the amount of total n that leached from both heat treated ballasts was very low at 0 25 mg kg or less accounting for less than 0 1 of the original n mass aside from ca and mg the amounts of metals and nutrients that were released from the h dwtr were nearly equivalent to those released from the h ls on a per mass basis additionally the percentage of available metals that leached was small less than 2 3 7 hypothetical flock and lock dose and estimated impact on water quality based on the p sorption capacity of 7 12 mg p g the binding efficiency ratio inverse of sorption capacity of h dwtr rb was estimated to be 140 g dwtr g p according to eq 2 a single dwtr dose would be 1257 g m2 683 mg l assuming 2 mg al l for the coagulant dose dc splitting the total dose into two sub doses would reduce each dose to 605 g m2 329 mg l of h dwtr at a dose of 329 mg l the expected removal efficacy of microcystis would be 85 to 95 depending on the alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentration in the lake water prior to treatment based on the measured leaching of n and metals the estimated increase in al fe ca and n concentrations due to leaching from h dwtr would be 1 2 0 66 53 4 and 0 07 µg l respectively for each of the two doses with lower increases for the other less abundant metals these values should be considered conservative i e maximum desorption as desorption studies were conducted with deionized water 4 discussion in this study we tested the hypothesis that dwtrs can be used as a ballast to effectively sink positively buoyant microcystis cyanobacteria in tropical lake water when combined with a low dose of coagulant dwtr was more effective at removing cyanobacteria from the water column compared to equivalent doses of a similarly treated ls chlorophyll a concentration ph and alkalinity affected the removal efficacy as well algal cell morphology and zeta potential were not affected by the dwtr treatments and the p sorption capacity of the dwtr was high indicating that dwtrs can precipitate microcystis blooms to the sediment and inactivate p while minimizing the risk for cell lysis and toxin release finally very little of the metals and nutrients contained with the dwtr were labile therefore dwtrs may represent a low cost alternative material for in lake restoration efforts that aim to precipitate microcystis blooms and inactivate sediment p 4 1 flocculation and sinking of microcystis climate change anthropogenic activities and biological competitive advantages have led to the global proliferation of harmful cyanobacterial blooms huisman et al 2018 paerl and barnard 2020 microcystis and other non diazotrophic i e unable to fix atmospheric n cyanobacteria can outcompete diazotrophic cyanobacteria in conditions where inorganic p is limited using a wide range of species specific strategies to either conserve energy wan et al 2019 or access a wider range of p pools schoffelen et al 2018 vrba et al 2018 therefore limiting inorganic p availability by inactivating sediment p and reducing external p loading alone may not reduce cyanobacterial blooms especially if excessive n inputs remain paerl 2018 and may even increase the likelihood of toxin producing strains of microcystis wu et al 2016 thus sinking cyanobacteria out of the water column using flock and lock may be necessary in certain scenarios lürling et al 2020a however sinking cyanobacteria can be difficult because several species including those in the microcystis genera have developed adaptations to be positively buoyant reynolds et al 1987 such as the production of gas vesicles muhetaer et al 2020 removing such positively buoyant cyanobacteria from the water column using only coagulants is especially challenging because a high dose of coagulant is required to overcome the positive buoyancy of the cyanobacteria noyma et al 2016 neutralize cell surface charges henderson et al 2008 and or induce sweeping under acidic ph conditions gonzalez torres et al 2014 furthermore precipitating positively buoyant cyanobacteria via al based coagulants is undesirable because charge neutralization and low ph induce cell lysis han et al 2016 and release cyanotoxins han et al 2013 whereas al hydrolysis induces transiently toxic conditions gensemer et al 2018 furthermore microcystis cyanobacteria form colonies by excreting a mucilaginous sheath consisting of polysaccharides li et al 2014 these sheaths can provide additional buoyancy fang et al 2014 and some defense against charge neutralization spoof et al 2020 further hindering efforts to precipitate blooms this study however showed that precipitation of microcystis colonies was possible with a negative zeta potential and ph greater than 7 additionally the low dose of alum in the experiments did not have a significant effect on zeta potential the results indicated two key processes likely occurred during the flock and sink experiments first the low dose of alum caused separate microcystis colonies to flocculate due to enhanced bridging of the polysaccharide polymers within the colonies either as a result of polysaccharide production xiao et al 2018 or due to protonation of the functional groups of the algal cell e g carboxyl groups cui et al 2014 which compressed the electrostatic double layer ndikubwimana et al 2015 second amorphous al hydroxide flocs adsorbed to the h dwtr ballast and to the flocculated microcystis colonies which then allowed the ballast and colonies to flocculate via the electrostatic patch mechanism zhao et al 2009 other flocculation mechanisms common in algae may have occurred to a lesser degree including charge neutralization and sweeping demir et al 2020 4 2 comparison of dwtr to other ballast materials several factors including p sorption capacity sinking efficacy and cost should be considered in comparing dwtrs to existing alternatives such as modified lss and lmbs dwtrs inherently have a high affinity to sorb p without the need to chemically modify them which is necessary for lss magalhaes et al 2019 pan et al 2019 in this study the maximum p sorption capacity of the dwtr was an order of magnitude higher than the ls dwtrs typically have a p sorption capacity of 5 to 25 mg g depending on their composition but can be higher kuster et al 2021 furthermore p sorption to dwtr occurs via multiple mechanisms yang et al 2006 the maximum sorption capacity was calculated using a non linear two surface langmuir isotherm which has been shown previously to best describe multi mechanism p sorption on dwtrs sui and thompson 2000 the use of the two surface isotherm and 30 day equilibrium period allowed for measurement of both fast sorption mechanisms such as ligand exchange and surface precipitation as well as the slower mechanism of intraparticle diffusion xu et al 2020 thus with multiple sorption mechanisms that are not easily reversible loganathan et al 2014 and the ability to selectively adsorb p yang et al 2006 dwtrs are an attractive choice for flock and lock the dwtr used in this study removed up to 96 of microcystis from the water column when combined with alum the sinking efficacy of the dwtr was slightly better than the ls however either ballast would be effective previous research has repeatedly demonstrated that the ballast is generally inconsequential in terms of sinking efficacy de lucena silva et al 2019 noyma et al 2017 therefore the emphasis for ballasts has been to find locally available and cheap materials miranda et al 2017 pan et al 2019 thongdam et al 2021 dwtrs can be readily available anywhere drinking water is produced using conventional sedimentation finally cost is an important consideration the most widely used ballast in flock and lock is lmb however we estimate that lmbs cost approximately 1000 usd per kg of inactivated p assuming lmb has a product cost around 5 usd per kg contains 5 of the active ingredient la and results in a molar binding ratio for la to p of 2 2 1 reitzel et al 2013 wagner 2017 this relatively high cost has been identified as a limiting factor in the use of lmbs de magalhaes et al 2019 spears et al 2013 on the other end of the spectrum of costs is alum alum has been used as a cost effective solid phase p sorbent in lakes for over half a century huser et al 2016b in thailand we estimate the cost of alum to inactivate p is around 40 usd per kg of inactivated p assuming alum has a product cost of 0 3 usd per kg contains 8 1 of the active ingredient al and results in a molar binding ratio for al to p of 12 6 1 kuster et al 2020 even with a higher product cost for alum in more advanced economies that treatment cost has been shown to be between 14 and 95 usd per kg of inactivated p huser et al 2016c which is still cheaper than lmbs however while this provides a floor for cost estimates alum is not a comparable product because it is not recommended for precipitating positively buoyant cyanobacteria therefore the targeted product cost of dwtr should be in the range of alum and lmbs or less based on the binding efficiency observed in this study product cost could be up to 2 usd per kg of dwtr in order for the material to be a cost competitive alternative to existing ballast materials pan et al 2019 this may be feasible because dwtrs have traditionally been considered a waste product and were disposed of in landfills or discharged to waterways keeley et al 2014 pre treatment of dwtrs remains the only substantial cost input which is discussed in the following sections 4 3 pre treatment of dwtrs pre treatment of dwtrs is a critical step prior to its application in environmental remediation this study used a dwtr treated with washing and oxygen limited heat and showed that the most abundant metals i e al fe ca and mg leached at a ratio of 1 or less under the neutral ph aerobic conditions investigated previous research has shown that the lability of these metals can increase under anaerobic or acidic conditions however the leachable proportion increased to only 2 3 yuan et al 2016b even assuming greater leaching of the most abundant metals in the dwtrs under anaerobic conditions likely to occur at the sediment water interface moura et al 2020 or during resuspension yin et al 2016 the concentrations projected to occur in lakes where this study s dwtr might be applied would not likely exceed regulatory standards or human health risks depending on the lake depth and existing concentrations mn and fe have been identified as having the highest human health risk via the non carcinogenic oral pathway yuan et al 2016b however leaching of these metals from dwtr has been reported as not toxic to insect larvae plants yuan et al 2016b and bacteria yuan et al 2016a notably the most abundant metal to desorb from the dwtr in this study was ca which can inactivate p via the formation of ca based minerals under the right conditions e g water ph 8 stumm and morgan 1996 thus possibly promoting the goal of reducing p availability oxygen limited heat treatment and sufficient washing have been shown to be the most effective way to prevent unwanted addition of n to the water column kuster et al 2021 heat treatment at 400 to 600 c can also have beneficial effects on p sorption by increasing the concentration of amorphous al and fe wang et al 2016 another option for pre treatment which was also a likely factor affecting results in this study is aging the raw dwtrs in this study were collected from a dewatering lagoon where they had undergone intermittent aeration and crystallization such aging has been shown to minimize n release wang et al 2018b reduce lability of metalloids agyin birikorang and o connor 2009 and even promote beneficial microbial diversity wang et al 2021a 4 4 considerations for use of dwtr in lake restoration when selecting a strategy for lake restoration the project goals holistic impact on ecology and cost should be carefully considered douglas et al 2016 flock and lock as a strategy is only appropriate in certain circumstances lürling et al 2020a furthermore the choice of dwtrs as the ballast in flock and lock may not always be the best choice important considerations include the raw water source of the dwtr the water quality and limnological conditions in the targeted lake and dosing requirements first the potential for a dwtr to contain pollutants derived from the raw water at the water treatment plant should be considered industrial effluent and urban runoff are potential sources of metals and other pollutants that would then potentially be found in the dwtr additionally cyanotoxins can concentrate in dwtr ai et al 2020 almuhtaram et al 2018 because the composition of dwtrs can vary widely al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 chemical analysis testing and pre treatment should be conducted prior to use of dwtrs in lake restoration secondly the water quality and limnological conditions of the target lake need to be considered this research assessed efficacy in sinking microcystis however water that is dominated by different genera of cyanobacteria may not respond similarly miranda et al 2017 this research also showed how ph alkalinity and chlorophyll a concentration affected the optimized alum dose and sinking efficacy therefore treatments need to account for variations in water quality lake water depth fetch and biological activity of the lake need to be considered as well this research showed that the dwtr did not cause any apparent morphological changes to the cellular structures of microcystis colonies the sem images of the colonies following application of dwtr and a low dose of alum were consistent with images from cells that did not undergo lysis yang et al 2020 it is expected that once intact cells are precipitated to the lake sediment microbial processes can degrade microcystins chen et al 2008 and the bioavailable p contents of the cells can be inactivated by the added p sorption capacity of the dwtr wang et al 2017 however under the right conditions resuspension and floatation of sedimented colonies could occur lürling et al 2020b wind driven turbulence carp huser et al 2016a and snails shen et al 2020 can cause resuspension of precipitated algae in such cases the inclusion of an algicide has been proposed in an approach known as kill flock and lock lürling et al 2020a finally dosing methodology remains uncertain in flock and lock both sinking efficacy and sediment p inactivation must be considered in dosing in this study it was shown that higher alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentrations reduced the sinking efficacy of dwtr and under any of these conditions higher dosing may be needed to achieve equivalent sinking in terms of sediment p inactivation previous recommendations for dosing dwtrs have proposed using a weight ratio of dwtr to lake sediment wang et al 2012 or linear formulas based on the amorphous al and fe content of the dwtr and available mobile p in the sediment wang et al 2013b dosing of al based p sorbents to lakes has been shown to be highly variable depending on the assumptions of the targeted forms of p active depth of lake sediment and binding ratio between al and p kuster et al 2020 furthermore the binding ratio of al to p can change substantially over periods of several years huser 2017 partly as a result of in lake aging of al floc berkowitz et al 2006 and continued sorption by the al and or fe minerals welch et al 2017 however in lake aging is expected to have less effect on p immobilization of a dwtr because dwtr has already undergone at least partial aging wang et al 2015 nevertheless this study did not experiment with lake sediment to determine whether the in situ binding efficiency of dwtr with sediment p would be equivalent to the in vitro results of this study future work will involve examining how dwtrs interact with p in lake sediment in situ following cyanobacteria precipitation 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that a recycled sludge generated from the sedimentation process during drinking water production was effective at sinking positively buoyant microcystis cyanobacteria colonies from tropical lake water when combined with a low dose of the coagulant aluminum sulfate removal efficacy was explained by ballast dose chlorophyll a concentration alkalinity and ph the maximum phosphorus sorption capacity of the studied drinking water treatment residual was high obviating the need for chemical modification of the ballast prior to use a dosing strategy was developed by modifying the dosing methodology for aluminum based sorbents to inactive phosphorus in lake sediment at that dose required to permanently inactive excess sediment p the amount of leached metals and nutrients was found to be low therefore the reuse of drinking water treatment residuals presents a potential low cost method for restoring lake water quality while at the same time being able to safely precipitate microcystis blooms under the conditions used in this study however more

16477,the combination of a low dose of coagulant with a ballast that can inactive phosphorus p in lake sediment a technique known as flock and lock is one method for restoration of eutrophic lakes the effectiveness of a drinking water treatment residual dwtr as a ballast in flock and lock was assessed using assays of eutrophic lake water from thailand dominated by microcystis aeruginosa cyanobacteria colonies by measuring changes in chlorophyll a ph and zeta potential p sorption isotherms were developed from long term batch equilibrium experiments desorption of nutrients and metals was assessed via leaching experiments and morphological changes to cellular structure were assessed using scanning electron microscopy results showed that combining dwtr with a low dose of aluminum sulfate 0 6 4 0 mg al l effectively sank 74 96 of microcystis with dwtr dose 50 400 mg l initial chlorophyll a concentration 92 976 µg l ph 7 4 9 3 and alkalinity 99 108 ppm caco3 identified as factors significantly associated with sinking efficacy p sorption capacity of the dwtr 7 12 mg g was significantly higher than a local soil 0 33 mg g enabling the dwtr to inactivate p in lake sediment desorption of al fe ca and n from the dwtr was estimated to contribute to a marginal increase in concentrations of those compounds in the water column of a small shallow lake 1 2 0 66 53 4 and 0 07 µg

restoration 1 introduction harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria are becoming increasingly frequent in freshwater lakes as a result of human activities that excessively enrich lakes with the nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p huisman et al 2018 these types of blooms are problematic because they can disrupt the ecosystem ibelings et al 2007 negatively affect the local economy dodds et al 2009 generate anoxic conditions that result in foul odors and fish kills pan et al 2011 and produce high levels of cyanotoxins díez quijada et al 2019 cyanotoxins are a diverse group of metabolites acutely toxic to humans and livestock dreher et al 2019 huang and zimba 2019 pouria et al 1998 and long term exposure has been associated with chronic diseases svirčev et al 2017 increased agricultural intensity urbanization and climate change are expected to further increase the incidence of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater lakes and reservoirs paerl 2018 reduction and prevention of harmful cyanobacterial blooms is a common priority in water resources management huisman et al 2018 the most critical strategy to achieve this goal and reverse eutrophication is to reduce external and internal sources of p carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2016 however in many cases it is also necessary to remove the existing cyanobacterial bloom from the water column to accelerate the lake restoration process lürling and mucci 2020 bloom management strategies include algicides dziga et al 2018 physical removal atkins et al 2001 biomanipulation macário et al 2021 and the combination of a coagulant with a ballast to precipitate cyanobacteria from the water column in an approach known as flock and sink de lucena silva et al 2019 however without immobilizing the potentially available p in the water column and lake sediment recurrence of blooms is likely li et al 2019 therefore precipitation of cyanobacterial blooms via a combination of a low dose of coagulant with a solid phase p fixative known as flock and lock has been proposed to address this shortcoming lürling and van oosterhout 2013 as such flock and lock not only removes positively buoyant cyanobacteria from the water column but also addresses internal p loading by inactivating historically accumulated legacy p in lake sediment lürling et al 2020a several materials have been identified for use in flock and lock including chitosan modified local soils lss pan et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 aluminum modified zeolites noyma et al 2017 and lanthanum modified bentonites lmbs miranda et al 2017 noyma et al 2016 van oosterhout and lürling 2011 waajen et al 2016 to date lmbs remain the most commonly used material in flock and lock lürling et al 2020a however the feasibility of lmbs and other modified materials is limited by the need to chemically modify them in order to increase the p sorption capacity which increases production costs de magalhaes et al 2019 spears et al 2013 furthermore lmbs can significantly increase the concentration of lanthanum in macrophytes water and food chains of treated lakes van oosterhout et al 2020 therefore alternative p fixing ballast materials that are safe effective and economical should be sought drinking water treatment residuals dwtrs which are a sludge waste product produced from the sedimentation process of drinking water production turner et al 2019 could potentially serve as a ballast in flock and lock recycled dwtrs have been developed as adsorbents for heavy metals lian et al 2020 nutrients wang et al 2021b and organic pollutants punamiya et al 2013 in particular dwtrs have a high p sorption capacity al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 the amorphous aluminum al or iron fe minerals often present in dwtrs from chemical coagulants added during water treatment facilitate effective and selective p sorption mechanisms yang et al 2006 therefore many reuse pathways exist for dwtrs that utilize this p sorption quality turner et al 2019 including as a soil amendment to treat stormwater soleimanifar et al 2016 as a bed for constructed wetlands babatunde et al 2010 as a sorbent in fixed column treatment of eutrophic lake water wang et al 2018a and as a sorbent to inactivate p in lake sediment wang et al 2013a using dwtrs in lake restoration projects also has the added benefit of cost and energy savings compared to producing new coagulants or modified clays xu et al 2016b the primary criticism of dwtrs has been the potential for metals and to a greater extent n to leach from dwtrs ichihara and nishio 2013 however several pre treatment options have been identified for successful reduction in the leachability of nutrients and metals in dwtrs including oxygen limited heat wang et al 2016 in situ aging agyin birikorang and o connor 2009 intermittent aeration wang et al 2018b and washing wang et al 2019 furthermore studies of ecological and human health risks of pre treated dwtrs have shown acceptably low risk in lake restoration applications yuan et al 2020 2017 2016b therefore because dwtrs often have an inherently high p sorption capacity they present a promising alternative to existing materials for the flock and lock technique the purpose of this study was to assess the potential of using dwtrs as a ballast in the flock and lock approach to lake restoration the objectives were to determine the effectiveness of a dwtr in sinking colonies of positively buoyant cyanobacteria relative to a ls control identify factors that affect removal efficacy and estimate what amount of nutrients and metals would be released from a hypothetical dose based on the p sorption capacity of the dwtr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water sampling lake water used for experimentation was collected from beung nong khot lake thailand 16 25 50 n 102 47 55 e a hypereutrophic lake total phosphorus 0 1 mg p l chlorophyll a 100 800 µg l typically dominated by microcystis and cylindrospermopsis genera of cyanobacteria

land within a tropical savanna climate köppen climate classification aw because field derived microcystis colonies have been shown to be morphologically different from laboratory grown colonies xu et al 2016a only field derived colonies were used in this study from the shoreline grab samples of lake water 30 50 l were collected from the top 50 cm of the littoral zone during cyanobacterial bloom events on three occasions between august and october 2020 the samples were placed into polyethylene bottles transported approximately 4 hours in coolers to the laboratory homogenized and used immediately in experiments lake water samples were characterized in the laboratory by measuring chlorophyll a using spectrophotometry standard method 10200 h ph sevencompact s220 mettler toledo switzerland alkalinity using colorimetry hanna hi775 and cell counts using a hemocytometer with compound microscope to identify predominant species 2 2 preparation and characterization of ballasts a composite sample of dewatered dwtr 20 30 kg was collected from five locations of a dewatering lagoon that received sludge generated during cleaning operations of the sedimentation tank of a drinking water treatment plant the plant which has a typical output of 5600 m3 hr of potable water treated surface water collected from the pong river thailand using polyaluminum chloride occasionally combined with aluminum sulfate alum as a coagulant a second ballast a sandy loam ls was obtained from ubon racthcatani province 15 7 21 n 104 55 19 e and used for comparison against the dwtr both ballasts were transported directly to the laboratory where they were washed by mixing with deionized water at a 1 1 w v ratio for 10 minutes after allowing the solids to settle the supernatant was carefully removed this washing cycle was repeated three times after which the remaining ballast sludge was oven dried at 110 c for 48 hours before being ground and sieved through 180 mesh 90 µm these ballasts were referred to as washed ls w ls and washed dwtr w dwtr a portion of each washed ballast was then treated using a muffle furnace isolab laborgeräte gmbh germany under oxygen limited conditions at 550 c for 10 hours the resulting ballasts were referred to as heat treated ls h ls and heat treated dwtr h dwtr all four ballasts were analyzed using the brunauer emmett teller bet adsorption desorption

inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes following digestion with the nitric perchloric acid method content of elemental carbon hydrogen and nitrogen was determined via combustion at 950 c leco chn628 usa a comparison of the above physiochemical properties was made to understand the effect of the heat treatment 2 3 flock and sink assays flock and sink assays in which a combination of ballast and or low dose coagulant was added to lake water containing cyanobacteria were used to test removal efficacy when using dwtr as a ballast alum al2 so4 3 18h2o commonly used by the provincial waterworks authority was obtained from a water supply retailer and used as a coagulant only h dwtr was used in the assays because oxygen limited treatment has been shown to improve the adsorptive properties of dwtr wang et al 2016 and reduce leaching of n wang et al 2018a for comparison purposes assays using h ls were also conducted the assay experiments followed procedures reported in a previous study thongdam et al 2021 briefly 250 ml of lake water was first placed into plastic graduated cylinders if coagulant was added to the assay the appropriate volume of a concentrated alum solution was added to the 250 ml aliquots in order to obtain the optimized al concentration which was determined using preliminary jar tests 1 hr if ballast was added it was gently mixed 5 10 sec with a glass rod and then left stagnant after one hour water samples 40 ml were taken from the top and bottom of the cylinders and analyzed for zeta potential malvern zetasizer nano malvern united kingdom morphological changes to algal cells using sem chlorophyll a and ph two experimental rounds of flock and sink assays were conducted fig 1 in the first round a single lake water sample was used the effect of the flock and sink treatment using h dwtr was evaluated against comparable treatment with h ls four different concentrations of ballast 50 100 200 and 400 mg l were tested for each ballast in addition several controls were run including ballast only controls alum only controls and no treatment controls the treatments were run in triplicate while the ballast only controls were run in duplicate the second experimental round used only h dwtr and two lake water samples multiple dilutions of each sample were created resulting in six more combinations of initial alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentrations in addition to round 1 dilutions were created by diluting with lake water that had been filtered with a 0 45 µm glass fiber membrane filter to remove chlorophyll biomass without substantially altering ph or alkalinity controls consisting of no treatment and alum only treatment were included as well fig 1 the effect of lake water quality alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentration and treatment factors ballast dose and optimized alum dose on the sinking efficacy of h dwtr were then statistically assessed see section 2 6 below 2 4 phosphorus sorption batch experiments sorption experiments were conducted to determine the maximum p sorption capacity of the two ballasts in the batch experiments 50 mg of dried ballast was added to 15 ml centrifuge tubes and filled with 10 ml of orthophosphate solution created from a sigma aldrich h2po4 phosphate 1000 mg po4 l or 326 mg p l standard solution dilutions of the standard solution 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 300 mg p l were created using deionized water the solution and dried ballast were thoroughly mixed in the centrifuge tubes by shaking and then left stagnant in the dark 30 days each tube was shaken for 10 seconds once per day to resuspend the solids after 30 days the tubes were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 minutes the amount of p sorbed to the ballast was determined indirectly from the reduction of p in the solution as determined by spectrophotometry 880 nm using the ascorbic acid method each batch was conducted in triplicate a two surface langmuir isotherm in nonlinear form with a modification to account for native p desorption kuster et al 2021 was then fitted to the data eq 1 1 q b 1 k 1 c 1 k 1 c b 2 k 2 c 1 k 2 c b 1 k 1 c 0 1 k 1 c 0 b 2 k 2 c 0 1 k 2 c 0 c 0 v 0 m 0 where q is the amount of p sorbed according to the modified two surface langmuir equation c is the aqueous concentration of p following equilibrium b1 and b2 are the high and low affinity p sorption capacities k1 and k2 are constants related to the high and low affinity binding energies of p sorption and c0 v0 and m0 are the aqueous concentration of p following equilibrium aqueous solution volume and mass of dwtr added in the batch in which zero p was added respectively the values for parameters b1 b2 k1 and k2 were determined by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals using the generalized reduced gradient solver within microsoft excel spreadsheet bolster and hornberger 2007 nash sutcliffe model efficiency measure e was also computed to assess goodness of fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 the maximum p sorption capacity b of each ballast was determined as the sum of b1 and b2 2 5 desorption experiments desorption or leaching experiments n 2 were conducted on h ls and h dwtr to estimate the potential for release of nutrients and metals to the surface water during flock and lock application the processed ballasts were mixed with 250 ml of deionized water by adding 12 5 g of pre treated ballast to erlenmeyer flasks 1 20 w v ratio then shaken on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm for 6 h at room temperature 23 c ichihara and nishio 2013 wang et al 2019 the suspension was decanted and filtered through 0 45 µm fiber filters the filtered water was analyzed for ammonia nh3 n tkn nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n using the kjeldahl method with mercury as a catalyst and for total p orthophosphate al ca fe mg mn and zn using icp oes following standard methods 2 6 statistical analysis two variables were computed from the analytical results of the flock and sink assays first weighted zeta potential in mv was computed as the average of the top and bottom zeta potentials weighted based on top and bottom chlorophyll a concentrations second removal efficacy as was computed as the percentage decrease in top chlorophyll a from the no treatment control for the given experiment differences in top chlorophyll a concentration weighted zeta potential and ph were each statistically compared between treatment groups using separate one way analysis of variance anova tests between group differences were assessed using tukey s post hoc comparison using a significance level of 0 05 these analyses were conducted on data collected from the first experimental round a multiple linear regression mlr model was used to assess factors associated with the removal efficacy of chlorophyll a using h dwtr in flock and sink treatment data from rounds 1 h dwtr only and 2 were used six continuous variables initial chlorophyll a concentration initial alkalinity initial ph optimized alum dose post alum ph and h dwtr dose were assessed for their linearity with removal efficacy graphical inspection showed h dwtr needed to be log transformed thus the natural log of h dwtr dose was used in the analysis the initial model was generated with forced entry of all variables variables were removed due to covariance or statistical insignificance to create the final model analyses were performed in stata 14 statacorp 2015 2 7 hypothetical dose calculation to evaluate the feasibility and water quality impact of using h dwtr as a ballast in flock and lock a theoretical dose necessary to inactivate sediment p was determined for a lake with a surface area of 18 5000 m2 and volume of 34 040 m3 which is nearby to this study s experimental lake kuster et al 2020 briefly the total recommended al dose for that lake was 102 g al m2 55 mg al l based on the targeted pool of potentially releasable p pl 9 285 g p m2 and binding efficiency ratio by weight for al p ral 11 g al g p the hypothetical full dose of h dwtr db mg l was computed based on eq 2 which determined how much dwtr was needed to inactivate the targeted sediment p pool pl after accounting for the low dose of coagulant added eq 2 is as follows 2 d b r b p l n d c v a r a l where pl is the targeted p pool in the sediment g p m2 v is the volume of the lake m3 a is the surface area of the lake m2 and rb g dwtr g p is the assumed binding efficiency ratio of the dwtr ballast to p by weight rb was computed as the inverse of the p sorption capacity the full dwtr dose was the sum of n sub doses each of which were combined with a dose of coagulant dc mg al l 3 results 3 1 characterization of lake water and ballasts initial analysis of the sampled lake water table 1 showed that the water used in the flock and sink assays was hypereutrophic carlson trophic index 89 98 carlson 1977 the dominant genus of cyanobacteria present was microcystis accounting for greater than 99 7 of cyanobacterial population based on cell counts two species were identified as microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii no other organisms were present in quantities substantial enough to be identified the h dwtr had a reddish orange color fig 2 a sem imaging showed rough surfaces and a porous structure the h ls had a pale brown color with smoother particle surfaces in sem imaging fig 2b analysis of the adsorption desorption isotherms and hysteresis loops fig s1 in supplementary information indicated that the h dwtr had a physical structure consistent with a porous powder and interconnected micropores thommes et al 2015 the h ls on the other hand was entirely macroporous with no micropores accordingly the h dwtr had a higher langmuir ssa 80 m2 g and total pore volume compared to the h ls 4 0 m2 g table 2 the h dwtr also contained slightly smaller particles d60 11 9 µm compared to the h ls d60 17 0 µm the heat treatment did not substantially alter the physical structure of the materials as the adsorption desorption isotherms and data reduction parameters were very similar between the washed and heated materials table 2 and fig s1 the most abundant minerals in both the ls and dwtr were al and calcium ca table 3 heat treatment however altered the chemical composition of the ballasts carbon nitrogen and hydrogen contents were reduced while the concentration of the most abundant metals generally increased in both ballasts al increased substantially by 80 to 135 as a result of the oxygen limited heat treatment other metals such as ca fe and magnesium mg increased slightly in the h dwtr and declined slightly in the h ls 3 2 effect of ballast type and ballast dose on top chlorophyll ph and zeta potential when the study lake water initial chlorophyll a concentration of 485 µg l round 1 was treated with a low dose of alum 2 mg al l alone the positively buoyant cyanobacterial biomass flocculated and accumulated at the top of the experimental cylinders at an average concentration of more than 2800 µg l which was higher than the no treatment control fig 3 a on the other hand if a low dose 50 100 mg l of ballast either h ls or h dwtr was added to the experimental cylinders alone the top chlorophyll a concentration was similar to the no treatment control fig 3b with no difference in results between the two ballasts at the highest dose of ballast alone 400 mg l approximately half the cyanobacteria sank nearly equal concentrations at the top and bottom of the cylinders with lower concentrations of chlorophyll a in the top of the cylinders treated with h dwtr compared to those treated with h ls however when a low dose of alum was combined with a ballast the cyanobacteria overwhelmingly sank fig 3c in the combination experiments the concentration of chlorophyll a at the bottom of the cylinders increased with increasing dose of ballast while the top chlorophyll a concentrations showed only slight differences across the different ballast doses and ballast types one way anova confirmed that top chlorophyll a was different among the experimental groups f19 36 7019 p 0 001 tukey s post hoc comparison identified eight homogenous groups of top chlorophyll a concentration fig 3 one way anova also indicated that the bottom chlorophyll a was different among the experimental groups f19 36 18 900 p 0 001 with tukey s post hoc comparison identifying 13 groups fig 3 generally the presence of alum and ballast were factors significantly associated with improved sinking of microcystis cyanobacteria h dwtr was also shown to be significantly better at sinking cyanobacteria especially at higher doses the addition of 2 mg al l of alum alone reduced the average ph from 8 03 to 7 44 fig 3a the ph in the ballast only treatments was similar to the no treatment control and the ph in the combination treatments was similar to the alum only control one way anova confirmed that ph was different among the groups f19 36 24 6 p 0 001 tukey s post hoc comparison identified that the ph was significantly lower in the treatments that included alum ballast type or dose did not affect ph finally the weighted zeta potential was similar across all treatments one way anova confirmed that no statistically significant differences existed in weighted zeta potential f19 36 1 57 p 0 12 3 3 water quality factors affecting sinking efficacy of dwtr the sinking efficacy in flock and sink assays using seven different experimental combinations of initial ph alkalinity and chlorophyll a concentration again showed that sinking efficacy increased with increased dose of h dwtr fig 4 however the percentage of cyanobacteria that precipitated to the bottom varied between 74 and 96 depending on water quality and h dwtr dose the optimized alum dose required to maximize flocculation of cyanobacteria was also different for each of the conditions comparing removal efficacy among the samples and fitting the mlr model to the data showed the relationship of each water quality parameter to removal efficacy the final mlr model adjusted r2 0 89 identified four factors initial alkalinity initial chlorophyll a initial ph and h dwtr dose log transformed as significantly associated with the removal efficacy of chlorophyll a table 4 the h dwtr dose on a logarithmic scale was positively associated with chlorophyll a removal i e the higher the dose the higher the proportion of chlorophyll a was removed during flock and sink application however the other three factors which were inherent properties of the original lake water ph alkalinity and chlorophyll a concentration were negatively associated with removal efficacy thus at equivalent h dwtr doses the removal efficacy was reduced as the initial alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentration in the lake water increased 3 4 morphological changes to agal cell structure sem images of microcystis colonies following application of the optimized dose of alum 2 mg al l and various concentrations of h dwtr showed no substantial morphological changes to cellular structure of the cyanobacteria pocks deformation or rupturing were not visible in the sem images following combined coagulant and ballast dosing from 50 to 400 mg l fig 5 similarly the microcystis cells were morphologically unchanged following the application of h ls in flock and sink or following the application of either h dwtr or h ls ballasts alone figs s2 s4 in supplementary information 3 5 phosphorus binding capacity of ballasts the maximum p sorption capacities of h ls and h dwtr were 0 33 mg p g and 7 12 mg p g respectively table 5 the bulk of the sorption capacity of the h dwtr was derived from the low affinity sorption capacity b2 the modeled p sorption fig 6 using the two surface langmuir isotherm showed very good agreement for both ballasts nash sutcliffe model efficiency 0 995 3 6 desorption of metals and nitrogen from ballasts results from the leaching experiments showed that the highest desorption rates on a per mass basis were observed for ca in both the h ls and h dwtr table 6 the equivalent of 162 4 mg kg of ca leached from h dwtr accounting for less than 0 5 of the original ca mass in the h dwtr the amount of total n that leached from both heat treated ballasts was very low at 0 25 mg kg or less accounting for less than 0 1 of the original n mass aside from ca and mg the amounts of metals and nutrients that were released from the h dwtr were nearly equivalent to those released from the h ls on a per mass basis additionally the percentage of available metals that leached was small less than 2 3 7 hypothetical flock and lock dose and estimated impact on water quality based on the p sorption capacity of 7 12 mg p g the binding efficiency ratio inverse of sorption capacity of h dwtr rb was estimated to be 140 g dwtr g p according to eq 2 a single dwtr dose would be 1257 g m2 683 mg l assuming 2 mg al l for the coagulant dose dc splitting the total dose into two sub doses would reduce each dose to 605 g m2 329 mg l of h dwtr at a dose of 329 mg l the expected removal efficacy of microcystis would be 85 to 95 depending on the alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentration in the lake water prior to treatment based on the measured leaching of n and metals the estimated increase in al fe ca and n concentrations due to leaching from h dwtr would be 1 2 0 66 53 4 and 0 07 µg l respectively for each of the two doses with lower increases for the other less abundant metals these values should be considered conservative i e maximum desorption as desorption studies were conducted with deionized water 4 discussion in this study we tested the hypothesis that dwtrs can be used as a ballast to effectively sink positively buoyant microcystis cyanobacteria in tropical lake water when combined with a low dose of coagulant dwtr was more effective at removing cyanobacteria from the water column compared to equivalent doses of a similarly treated ls chlorophyll a concentration ph and alkalinity affected the removal efficacy as well algal cell morphology and zeta potential were not affected by the dwtr treatments and the p sorption capacity of the dwtr was high indicating that dwtrs can precipitate microcystis blooms to the sediment and inactivate p while minimizing the risk for cell lysis and toxin release finally very little of the metals and nutrients contained with the dwtr were labile therefore dwtrs may represent a low cost alternative material for in lake restoration efforts that aim to precipitate microcystis blooms and inactivate sediment p 4 1 flocculation and sinking of microcystis climate change anthropogenic activities and biological competitive advantages have led to the global proliferation of harmful cyanobacterial blooms huisman et al 2018 paerl and barnard 2020 microcystis and other non diazotrophic i e unable to fix atmospheric n cyanobacteria can outcompete diazotrophic cyanobacteria in conditions where inorganic p is limited using a wide range of species specific strategies to either conserve energy wan et al 2019 or access a wider range of p pools schoffelen et al 2018 vrba et al 2018 therefore limiting inorganic p availability by inactivating sediment p and reducing external p loading alone may not reduce cyanobacterial blooms especially if excessive n inputs remain paerl 2018 and may even increase the likelihood of toxin producing strains of microcystis wu et al 2016 thus sinking cyanobacteria out of the water column using flock and lock may be necessary in certain scenarios lürling et al 2020a however sinking cyanobacteria can be difficult because several species including those in the microcystis genera have developed adaptations to be positively buoyant reynolds et al 1987 such as the production of gas vesicles muhetaer et al 2020 removing such positively buoyant cyanobacteria from the water column using only coagulants is especially challenging because a high dose of coagulant is required to overcome the positive buoyancy of the cyanobacteria noyma et al 2016 neutralize cell surface charges henderson et al 2008 and or induce sweeping under acidic ph conditions gonzalez torres et al 2014 furthermore precipitating positively buoyant cyanobacteria via al based coagulants is undesirable because charge neutralization and low ph induce cell lysis han et al 2016 and release cyanotoxins han et al 2013 whereas al hydrolysis induces transiently toxic conditions gensemer et al 2018 furthermore microcystis cyanobacteria form colonies by excreting a mucilaginous sheath consisting of polysaccharides li et al 2014 these sheaths can provide additional buoyancy fang et al 2014 and some defense against charge neutralization spoof et al 2020 further hindering efforts to precipitate blooms this study however showed that precipitation of microcystis colonies was possible with a negative zeta potential and ph greater than 7 additionally the low dose of alum in the experiments did not have a significant effect on zeta potential the results indicated two key processes likely occurred during the flock and sink experiments first the low dose of alum caused separate microcystis colonies to flocculate due to enhanced bridging of the polysaccharide polymers within the colonies either as a result of polysaccharide production xiao et al 2018 or due to protonation of the functional groups of the algal cell e g carboxyl groups cui et al 2014 which compressed the electrostatic double layer ndikubwimana et al 2015 second amorphous al hydroxide flocs adsorbed to the h dwtr ballast and to the flocculated microcystis colonies which then allowed the ballast and colonies to flocculate via the electrostatic patch mechanism zhao et al 2009 other flocculation mechanisms common in algae may have occurred to a lesser degree including charge neutralization and sweeping demir et al 2020 4 2 comparison of dwtr to other ballast materials several factors including p sorption capacity sinking efficacy and cost should be considered in comparing dwtrs to existing alternatives such as modified lss and lmbs dwtrs inherently have a high affinity to sorb p without the need to chemically modify them which is necessary for lss magalhaes et al 2019 pan et al 2019 in this study the maximum p sorption capacity of the dwtr was an order of magnitude higher than the ls dwtrs typically have a p sorption capacity of 5 to 25 mg g depending on their composition but can be higher kuster et al 2021 furthermore p sorption to dwtr occurs via multiple mechanisms yang et al 2006 the maximum sorption capacity was calculated using a non linear two surface langmuir isotherm which has been shown previously to best describe multi mechanism p sorption on dwtrs sui and thompson 2000 the use of the two surface isotherm and 30 day equilibrium period allowed for measurement of both fast sorption mechanisms such as ligand exchange and surface precipitation as well as the slower mechanism of intraparticle diffusion xu et al 2020 thus with multiple sorption mechanisms that are not easily reversible loganathan et al 2014 and the ability to selectively adsorb p yang et al 2006 dwtrs are an attractive choice for flock and lock the dwtr used in this study removed up to 96 of microcystis from the water column when combined with alum the sinking efficacy of the dwtr was slightly better than the ls however either ballast would be effective previous research has repeatedly demonstrated that the ballast is generally inconsequential in terms of sinking efficacy de lucena silva et al 2019 noyma et al 2017 therefore the emphasis for ballasts has been to find locally available and cheap materials miranda et al 2017 pan et al 2019 thongdam et al 2021 dwtrs can be readily available anywhere drinking water is produced using conventional sedimentation finally cost is an important consideration the most widely used ballast in flock and lock is lmb however we estimate that lmbs cost approximately 1000 usd per kg of inactivated p assuming lmb has a product cost around 5 usd per kg contains 5 of the active ingredient la and results in a molar binding ratio for la to p of 2 2 1 reitzel et al 2013 wagner 2017 this relatively high cost has been identified as a limiting factor in the use of lmbs de magalhaes et al 2019 spears et al 2013 on the other end of the spectrum of costs is alum alum has been used as a cost effective solid phase p sorbent in lakes for over half a century huser et al 2016b in thailand we estimate the cost of alum to inactivate p is around 40 usd per kg of inactivated p assuming alum has a product cost of 0 3 usd per kg contains 8 1 of the active ingredient al and results in a molar binding ratio for al to p of 12 6 1 kuster et al 2020 even with a higher product cost for alum in more advanced economies that treatment cost has been shown to be between 14 and 95 usd per kg of inactivated p huser et al 2016c which is still cheaper than lmbs however while this provides a floor for cost estimates alum is not a comparable product because it is not recommended for precipitating positively buoyant cyanobacteria therefore the targeted product cost of dwtr should be in the range of alum and lmbs or less based on the binding efficiency observed in this study product cost could be up to 2 usd per kg of dwtr in order for the material to be a cost competitive alternative to existing ballast materials pan et al 2019 this may be feasible because dwtrs have traditionally been considered a waste product and were disposed of in landfills or discharged to waterways keeley et al 2014 pre treatment of dwtrs remains the only substantial cost input which is discussed in the following sections 4 3 pre treatment of dwtrs pre treatment of dwtrs is a critical step prior to its application in environmental remediation this study used a dwtr treated with washing and oxygen limited heat and showed that the most abundant metals i e al fe ca and mg leached at a ratio of 1 or less under the neutral ph aerobic conditions investigated previous research has shown that the lability of these metals can increase under anaerobic or acidic conditions however the leachable proportion increased to only 2 3 yuan et al 2016b even assuming greater leaching of the most abundant metals in the dwtrs under anaerobic conditions likely to occur at the sediment water interface moura et al 2020 or during resuspension yin et al 2016 the concentrations projected to occur in lakes where this study s dwtr might be applied would not likely exceed regulatory standards or human health risks depending on the lake depth and existing concentrations mn and fe have been identified as having the highest human health risk via the non carcinogenic oral pathway yuan et al 2016b however leaching of these metals from dwtr has been reported as not toxic to insect larvae plants yuan et al 2016b and bacteria yuan et al 2016a notably the most abundant metal to desorb from the dwtr in this study was ca which can inactivate p via the formation of ca based minerals under the right conditions e g water ph 8 stumm and morgan 1996 thus possibly promoting the goal of reducing p availability oxygen limited heat treatment and sufficient washing have been shown to be the most effective way to prevent unwanted addition of n to the water column kuster et al 2021 heat treatment at 400 to 600 c can also have beneficial effects on p sorption by increasing the concentration of amorphous al and fe wang et al 2016 another option for pre treatment which was also a likely factor affecting results in this study is aging the raw dwtrs in this study were collected from a dewatering lagoon where they had undergone intermittent aeration and crystallization such aging has been shown to minimize n release wang et al 2018b reduce lability of metalloids agyin birikorang and o connor 2009 and even promote beneficial microbial diversity wang et al 2021a 4 4 considerations for use of dwtr in lake restoration when selecting a strategy for lake restoration the project goals holistic impact on ecology and cost should be carefully considered douglas et al 2016 flock and lock as a strategy is only appropriate in certain circumstances lürling et al 2020a furthermore the choice of dwtrs as the ballast in flock and lock may not always be the best choice important considerations include the raw water source of the dwtr the water quality and limnological conditions in the targeted lake and dosing requirements first the potential for a dwtr to contain pollutants derived from the raw water at the water treatment plant should be considered industrial effluent and urban runoff are potential sources of metals and other pollutants that would then potentially be found in the dwtr additionally cyanotoxins can concentrate in dwtr ai et al 2020 almuhtaram et al 2018 because the composition of dwtrs can vary widely al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 chemical analysis testing and pre treatment should be conducted prior to use of dwtrs in lake restoration secondly the water quality and limnological conditions of the target lake need to be considered this research assessed efficacy in sinking microcystis however water that is dominated by different genera of cyanobacteria may not respond similarly miranda et al 2017 this research also showed how ph alkalinity and chlorophyll a concentration affected the optimized alum dose and sinking efficacy therefore treatments need to account for variations in water quality lake water depth fetch and biological activity of the lake need to be considered as well this research showed that the dwtr did not cause any apparent morphological changes to the cellular structures of microcystis colonies the sem images of the colonies following application of dwtr and a low dose of alum were consistent with images from cells that did not undergo lysis yang et al 2020 it is expected that once intact cells are precipitated to the lake sediment microbial processes can degrade microcystins chen et al 2008 and the bioavailable p contents of the cells can be inactivated by the added p sorption capacity of the dwtr wang et al 2017 however under the right conditions resuspension and floatation of sedimented colonies could occur lürling et al 2020b wind driven turbulence carp huser et al 2016a and snails shen et al 2020 can cause resuspension of precipitated algae in such cases the inclusion of an algicide has been proposed in an approach known as kill flock and lock lürling et al 2020a finally dosing methodology remains uncertain in flock and lock both sinking efficacy and sediment p inactivation must be considered in dosing in this study it was shown that higher alkalinity ph and chlorophyll a concentrations reduced the sinking efficacy of dwtr and under any of these conditions higher dosing may be needed to achieve equivalent sinking in terms of sediment p inactivation previous recommendations for dosing dwtrs have proposed using a weight ratio of dwtr to lake sediment wang et al 2012 or linear formulas based on the amorphous al and fe content of the dwtr and available mobile p in the sediment wang et al 2013b dosing of al based p sorbents to lakes has been shown to be highly variable depending on the assumptions of the targeted forms of p active depth of lake sediment and binding ratio between al and p kuster et al 2020 furthermore the binding ratio of al to p can change substantially over periods of several years huser 2017 partly as a result of in lake aging of al floc berkowitz et al 2006 and continued sorption by the al and or fe minerals welch et al 2017 however in lake aging is expected to have less effect on p immobilization of a dwtr because dwtr has already undergone at least partial aging wang et al 2015 nevertheless this study did not experiment with lake sediment to determine whether the in situ binding efficiency of dwtr with sediment p would be equivalent to the in vitro results of this study future work will involve examining how dwtrs interact with p in lake sediment in situ following cyanobacteria precipitation 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that a recycled sludge generated from the sedimentation process during drinking water production was effective at sinking positively buoyant microcystis cyanobacteria colonies from tropical lake water when combined with a low dose of the coagulant aluminum sulfate removal efficacy was explained by ballast dose chlorophyll a concentration alkalinity and ph the maximum phosphorus sorption capacity of the studied drinking water treatment residual was high obviating the need for chemical modification of the ballast prior to use a dosing strategy was developed by modifying the dosing methodology for aluminum based sorbents to inactive phosphorus in lake sediment at that dose required to permanently inactive excess sediment p the amount of leached metals and nutrients was found to be low therefore the reuse of drinking water treatment residuals presents a potential low cost method for restoring lake water quality while at the same time being able to safely precipitate microcystis blooms under the conditions used in this study however more

16478,understanding the speciation and mobilization mechanisms of potentially toxic metals in sediments is critical to aquatic ecosystem health and contamination remediation in urban rivers in this study chemical sequential extraction a thermodynamic chemical equilibrium model visual minteq ver 3 1 diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and high resolution dialysis hr peeper techniques were integrated to identify seasonal variations in cadmium cd mobility in sulfidized sediments acid soluble cd was the dominant geochemical fraction in sediments followed by residual oxidizable and reducible cd the dgt labile cd concentration was associated with various geochemical processes and was independent of the total concentration and geochemical fractionation of cd in sediments sulfate reduction facilitated the formation of insoluble cds and induced low cd concentrations in sediment porewater sulfide oxidation was principally responsible for lowered porewater ph and elevated cd concentrations in summer strongly acidic conditions promoted release of sediment cd but might reduce the binding efficiency of chelex resin gel for dissolved cd leading to underestimation of the mobility of sediment cd sediments generally functioned as a sink for cd in winter and shifted to acting as a source in summer releasing cd into the overlying water mainly as cd s complexes with high potential to migrate downstream graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords diffusive flux mobilization mechanisms sediment water interface speciation modeling sulfide oxidation 1 introduction cadmium cd one of the most toxic and carcinogenic chemical elements is a widespread contaminant in the environment worldwide balistrieri and blank 2008 usepa 1989 trace cd concentrations in environmental media can exert acute or chronic toxic effects on organisms and threaten human health via bioaccumulation in food webs croteau et al 2005 zhang and reynolds 2019 due to the deleterious impacts of cd it has been listed as a priority contaminant by the united states and the european union claudia 1993 the european parliament and the council of the european union 2013 in aquatic environments dissolved cd derived from anthropogenic discharge tends to adsorb onto suspended particles followed by deposition in sediments which are generally considered a major sink for metals gao et al 2016 zheng et al 2013 in turn sediment can act as an important cd source in the water column due to resuspension and changes in physico chemical conditions caetano et al 2003 xu et al 2016 with such changes release of sediment cd might lead to secondary contamination of the overlying water posing risks to aquatic organisms and domestic water supplies consequently seasonal release characteristics and remobilization mechanisms of sediment cd have attracted considerable concern worldwide the chemical sequential extraction procedure developed by the european community bureau of reference bcr has been intensively utilized to explore the mobility and bioavailability of trace metals in sediments gao et al 2018 gao et al 2017 however this traditional research approach has been reported to have two major deficiencies analytical errors resulting from changes in the chemical properties of sediment samples during transportation storage and pretreatment processes and overestimation of metal mobility induced by advanced leaching of acid volatile sulfide bound metals during the extraction process billon et al 2001 therefore passive sampling techniques such as diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and high resolution dialysis hr peeper have been conducted in situ for measurement of labile species and the concentrations of dissolved target chemicals respectively chen et al 2021 li et al 2021 zhang et al 1998 recently the chelex dgt probe has been widely employed to identify key factors and characterize the effects of geochemical cycling of crucial elements on the mobility of cd in sediments or soils based on field monitoring campaigns some reports have indicated that differences in physico chemical properties including cation exchange capacity cec ph and grain size composition of soils affect the distribution characteristics of cd between the solid and liquid phases as well as its mobilization potential muhammad et al 2012 perez and anderson 2009 for sediment rapid degradation of organic matter om and reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides were found to be mainly responsible for the remobilization and release of cd chen et al 2021 parker et al 2017 in the presence of trace levels of sulfides in sediment porewater cd tends to be immobilized due to the formation of insoluble cds wang and wang 2017 application of chelex and agi dgt probes revealed concurrent release of cd and sulfides confirming the vital role of sulfur cycling in controlling cd mobility in sediments zhang et al 2020b furthermore in dgt assembly of diffusive gel layers with various pore sizes allows for the direct measurement of labile inorganically and organically bound cd species in natural waters zhang and davison 2000 however dgt measurements are unsuitable for the quantitative determination of various labile cd species in complex aqueous environments due to the large uncertainties surrounding ligand composition in general dissolved trace metals are present in a variety of chemical forms or species with marked differences in bioavailability and mobility depending on the physico chemical properties and ligands therefore thermodynamic chemical equilibrium models such as visual minteq and wham have been used to predict metal speciation in various water bodies charriau et al 2011 unsworth et al 2005 the results showed that the predicted concentrations of cd2 and cdcl species decreased with increasing salinity leading to the formation of cdcl2 in the overlaying water column whereas dissolved cd tended to complex with sulfides in sediment porewater charriau et al 2011 ramteke et al 2021 when dissolved organic matter was taken into account the contribution of free cd2 to dissolved cd decreased as calculated using visual minteq cornu et al 2009 in neutralized acid mine drainage namd water the dissolved cd consisting principally of labile species sum of free ion and inorganic and weak organic complexes was roughly equivalent to the dgt measured cd indicating that the dissolved cd was fully available for dgt uptake omanovic et al 2015 in contrast complexation of humic substances with cd may result in low uptake of cd by dgt in freshwater sierra et al 2017 various physico chemical properties of the aquatic environment can affect the chemical speciation characteristics of dissolved cd altering its migration potential as assessed by dgt integrating dgt measurement into chemical speciation modeling can facilitate establishment of linkages between labile metal species e g free ion and inorganic and weak organic complexes and the fraction measured by dgt to elucidate the remobilization mechanisms of sediment metals fick s first law of diffusion has been broadly applied to estimation of the diffusive flux of individual metals across the sediment water interface swi for identification of sources and sinks blasco et al 2000 however estimation based on the total concentrations of dissolved cd might be problematic due to apparent differences in diffusion coefficients between cd inorganic and cd organic complexes in aqueous environments zhang and davison 1999 estimation of individual cd species can eliminate such errors enabling precise quantification of cd flux at the swi with an area of 56 000 km2 and a population of more than 70 million the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba located in the pearl river estuary in south china is one of the four largest bay areas worldwide in terms of gross domestic production due to the rapid urbanization and social economic development that has occurred since the 1990s the gba has suffered from serious trace metal contamination associated with anthropogenic discharge particularly riverine sediment contamination with the toxic element cd gao et al 2021 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2015 based on hypotheses of seasonal cycling of cd source and sink phases between the sediment and water column resulting from changes in natural conditions and the impacts of anthropogenic activities this study selected the highly urbanized xizhi river basin located near an important water source area in the gba as a study area to reveal the seasonal characteristics of cd migration and immobilization behaviors in sediment identify key driving factors or geochemical reactions that control remobilization of sediment cd and quantify the migration processes of various chemical forms of cd across the swi 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area and sampling site the xizhi river located on the southeast side of the gba in south china is 176 km long and has a catchment area of 4120 km2 fig 1 the river originates from the baipenzhu reservoir and is the second largest tributary of the dongjiang river a crucial domestic water source for several megacities including huizhou shenzhen and dongguan the xizhi river watershed has a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean precipitation from 1545 to 1989 mm and the majority of the rainfall approximately 80 occurs during the wet season from april to september the danshui river is a tributary of the xizhi river arising from the wutong mountains in shenzhen city it flows through industrial areas for electroplating and the manufacture of metallic equipment and machinery which are intensively distributed in the longang and huiyang districts and drains into the xizhi river in the densely populated huicheng district of huizhou city fig 1 previous research indicated that the discharge of industrial effluent was mainly responsible for source of severe trace metal e g cu zn and ni contamination in river water and considerable enrichment in riverine sediments which poses serious threats to the downstream aquatic ecosystem and water resources wang et al 2015 the sampling sites d1 and d2 used in the present study are located on the lower and upper reaches of the danshui river respectively site x2 is situated at the upper reach of the confluence zone of the danshui river and can be considered a reference site due to its lower concentrations of trace metals and nutrients in sediments gao et al 2021 li et al 2021 site x1 located at the outlet of the xizhi river was used to reveal the potential impacts of cd release from sediments on a water source area 2 2 collection and storage of sediment core samples a gravity sampler equipped with a polycarbonate tube was employed to collect sediment core samples duplicate sediment cores of similar lengths with a diameter of approximately 65 mm were collected at each site in november 2019 and july 2020 representing the winter and summer seasons all sediment cores containing overlying water were wrapped immediately with aluminum foil to protect the samples from sunlight after transportation to the laboratory sediment cores were equilibrated in a thermostatic incubator at a temperature determined during field investigations and used for dgt and hr peeper probes deployment 2 3 deployment and analysis of dgt and hr peeper probes flat chelex agi dgt probes with an exposure area of 150 mm height 18 mm width and an hr peeper with a total exposure area of 200 mm height 40 mm width purchased from www dgtresearch com cn and www easysensor net respectively were applied to reveal seasonal variations in the vertical distribution patterns of target chemicals all dgt and hr peeper probes were deoxygenated prior to use a small mark was made on all probes to indicate the height of 20 mm above the sediment water interface swi then the hr peeper probe was gradually inserted into one sediment core until the mark reached the swi the chelex and agi dgt probes were bound back to back and inserted into another sediment core sediment cores containing dgt and hr peeper probes were incubated without light at a specific temperature determined during the field investigation dgt and hr peeper probes were retrieved after 24 and 48 h respectively and thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water prior to subsequent analysis the hr peeper probe is composed of 36 chambers arranged vertically each of which has an exposure area of 4 mm height 40 mm width and contains 0 4 ml of milli q water after passive sampling the water samples in the chambers were collected using a pipette at 10 mm intervals and acidified with 40 µl of 0 1 m hcl followed by dilution to 8 ml with ultrapure water then concentrations of metals cu zn ni pb cd k na ca mg fe mn and al were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms x 2 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa or inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes iris pleasant prairie wi usa 10 of samples were randomly selected for duplicate analysis and the standard deviation of analysis results was less than 15 recoveries of standard solution with different cd concentrations were in range of 93 2 106 during icp ms analysis the dgt analysis and calculation processes have been described previously ding et al 2012 xu et al 2016 zhang and davison 1995 and are presented in the supporting information si 2 4 thermodynamic modeling of cd speciation in water samples speciation modeling of cd in water samples at four sites was performed using the thermodynamic chemical equilibrium model visual minteq ver 3 1 gustafsson 2013 the input parameters included basic physico chemical properties ec ph eh and t major ions k na ca2 mg2 f cl so4 2 nutrients no3 po4 3 dissolved organic carbon doc major metals fe mn and al trace metals cu zn ni pb and cd and labile s ii as determined through agi dgt measurement sample collection and measurement of parameters are described in detail in the si humic substances hs consisting mainly of fulvic acids fa and humic acids ha play a crucial role in controlling the chemical speciation bioavailability and fate of trace metals in aquatic environments omanovic et al 2015 zhang and davison 2000 to assess interactions of metals with hs the stockholm humic model shm which employs a discrete distribution of binding sites was adopted to describe proton and cationic metal binding to hs gustafsson 2001 hs are assumed to account for 70 of organic carbon oc and contain 50 carbon and therefore the concentration of hs was defined as 1 4 times the doc concentration charriau et al 2011 han et al 2014 during cd speciation simulation a ratio of 9 1 between fa and ha was applied as this ratio was considered representative of conditions in freshwater han et al 2013 sierra et al 2017 zhang 2004 additionally colloidal components such as colloidal iron iii and aluminum iii oxyhydroxides were excluded from the modeling process due to the difficulty of measurement under anoxic conditions charriau et al 2011 2 5 total concentration and geochemical fractionation of sediment cd approximately 50 mg of pretreated sediment sample was digested in an hno3 hf mixture in a teflon tube and the cd concentration was measured using icp ms a modified bcr procedure was adopted for determination of the acid soluble f1 reducible f2 and oxidizable f3 fractions of sediment cd the residual fraction f4 was calculated by subtracting the first three fractions f1 f2 f3 from the total cd concentration measured full details of the modified bcr procedure can be found in our previous reports gao et al 2021 gao et al 2018 quality assurance and quality control qa qc was conducted during measurement using a standard reference material bcr 701 and method blank the recoveries of the total cd concentration and geochemical fractions were 92 4 0 93 total cd 101 0 7 f1 81 3 1 34 f2 87 4 7 1 f3 and 102 13 2 f4 in addition 10 of sediment samples were randomly selected for duplicate measurements and the standard deviation of analysis results was less than 10 2 6 estimation for diffusive flux of cd at the swi based on the measured total cd concentration and predicted cd speciation in the overlying water and porewater a benthic exchange flux model based on fick s first law of diffusion eq 1 blasco et al 2000 can be used to estimate the diffusive flux of cd at the swi 1 j φ d s δ c δ z x 0 2 d s d w φ f where j is the diffusive flux of the chemical at the swi µg m 2 d 1 d w and d s are the diffusion coefficients of the chemical in water and sediment cm2 s 1 respectively based on the porosity φ and formation resistivity factor f of the sediment ds can be determined using eq 2 f 1 φ 3 when φ 0 7 otherwise f 1 φ 2 li and gregory 1974 δc δz x 0 represents the concentration gradient of the chemical at the swi µg l 1 cm 1 and was derived through linear fitting of the vertical distribution of the chemical near the swi to quantify the migration direction and flux of various cd species at the swi eq 1 can be decomposed into the sum of fluxes of cd2 cd s cd inorganic excluding cd s species cd fa and cd ha complexes which is presented as eq 3 3 j φ d s ion δ c ion δ z x 0 φ d s s δ c s δ z x 0 φ d s inorg δ

complexes and cd ha complexes in sediment cm2 s 1 respectively in the present study ds ion ds s and ds inorg were assumed to be equal and were calculated based on d w which is provided in the manufacturer s operating guide dw fa and dw ha are 2 46 10 6 and 1 79 10 6 cm2 s 1 in water at 20 c zhang and davison 1999 respectively and these values were applied in the determination of ds fa and ds ha 2 7 statistical analysis the arcmap raster calculator arcgis 10 3 esri was used to transform the grayscale intensity of colored agi gels into the accumulated mass of s ii per unit area and then estimate the concentration profiles of dgt labile s ii at a 10 mm interval normal distribution testing of the dataset was conducted prior to statistical analysis as not all of the data set satisfied the normal distribution characteristics the nonparametric kruskal wallis h test and mann whitney u test were adopted to reveal differences in various variables among the four sampling sites and between the two sampling periods respectively the nonparametric spearman s correlation was used to identify the relationships among sediment physico chemical properties geochemical fractions of sediment cd dgt labile chemicals and predicted cd species differences and correlations were considered significant at p 0 05 all statistical analysis were performed using spss software ver 16 0 for windows 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical properties of water and sediment samples basic physico chemical parameters of the overlying water collected from the xizhi river and the danshui river are summarized in table s1 of the si the river water temperatures were 24 2 25 6 c in november and 29 7 34 4 c in july with mean dissolved oxygen do concentrations of 6 81 mg l 1 and 5 64 mg l 1 respectively the electrical conductivity ec exhibited a decreasing tendency from the danshui river 279 750 µs cm 1 to the lower reach of the xizhi river site x1 310 and 263 µs cm 1 with exception of site x2 71 3 and 72 0 µs cm 1 the dilution effect of precipitation in rainy seasons was the main driver of lower ec values in july mean 248 µs cm 1 than in november 431 µs cm 1 the dilution effect might be also an important driver of lower no3 levels in the river water in july mean 3 8 mg l 1 compared to november 18 7 mg l 1 however the decrease in no3 concentrations was partly attributed to bacteria mediated denitrification reactions which occur readily at relatively high water temperatures he et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a as shown in fig s1 the acid base property of the overlying water and porewater was slightly alkaline with a ph range of 7 00 8 39 among the four sampling sites in november in july the porewater ph was lower and equal across all depths at sites d1 and d2 whereas a decreasing trend with depth was observed at sites x1 4 56 6 34 and x2 5 45 6 43 reflecting the acidity of the porewater to various extents doc profiles were generally stable except for site x1 in july where the doc concentration peaked 162 mg l 1 between depths of 30 and 70 mm so4 2 decreased markedly with depth and remained at the µg l 1 level in the bottom porewater in november in the sediment environment early diagenesis driven by oc mineralization can cause conversion from oxic to anoxic conditions promoting a series of reduction reactions including sulfate reduction gao et al 2020 wang and wang 2017 this shift can be evidenced by a steep drop in the redox potential relative to the overlying water toward sediments and negative eh values below the swi fig s1 however so4 2 concentrations showed increasing trends below the swi or the depth of 50 mm at all sites in july previous reports have indicated that acid volatile sulfide avs can be oxidized to sulfates accompanying with production of h after sediment resuspension leading to severe acidification of sediment with ph 5 table s2 burton et al 2006 karimian et al 2017 richards et al 2018 shipley et al 2011 in addition nitrate was reported to serve as an electron acceptor to oxidize sulfides to sulfates concurrent with acidity generation table s2 he et al 2017 consequently avs oxidation induced by sediment resuspension during flood seasons might be responsible mainly for so4 2 enrichment in sediments and the marked decrease of porewater ph at sites x1 and x2 in july fig s1 at which sediments had insufficient hco3 to buffer generated h additionally sulfides oxidation driven by denitrification supposed to be another potential cause due to pronounced depletion of no3 in porewater fig s1 and table s2 3 2 total concentration and geochemical fractionation of sediment cd the spatial distribution characteristics and geochemical fractions of sediment cd at four sampling sites are presented in fig 2 the total cd concentration in sediments ctotal cd was significantly higher in samples collected from the danshui river d1 2 45 0 83 mg kg 1 and d2 3 36 1 34 mg kg 1 than those from the xizhi river x1 0 49 0 12 mg kg 1 and x2 0 49 0 08 mg kg 1 p 0 05 previous research indicated that the discharge of electroplating wastewater is the main driver of the moderate to heavy accumulation of trace metals in sediments of the danshui river wang et al 2015 overall the average proportions of the various geochemical fractions of sediment cd followed the descending order of acid soluble 46 8 10 5 residual 21 8 7 2 oxidizable 18 5 9 3 reducible 12 8 3 9 cd in fraction f1 was readily desorbed from sediment solids through ion exchange or dissolution under weakly acidic conditions as it is present as free ions that exhibit strong mobility gao et al 2018 reducible cd was generally bound to amorphous fe mn oxides which could be mobilized through dissolution of fe mn oxides under reducing conditions xu et al 2016 the cd in fraction f3 was mainly bound to organic matter om and sulfides and could be released from sediment grains during the decomposition of om or sulfide oxidation in an oxidizing environment du laing et al 2009 thus sediment cd release potential generally decreased in the order of sites d2 d1 x1 x2 according to their acid soluble cd f1 concentrations fig 2 however a previous report noted that abundant acid volatile sulfides avs can be dissolved during first step extraction f1 of sulfidized sediments inducing rapid release of metals formerly bound to sulfides billon et al 2001 additionally changes in the physico chemical properties e g t ph eh and doc of the aquatic environment induced by seasonal variations and anthropogenic activities could apparently affect the solid liquid phase partitioning of metals thereby impacting the source of metals released from sediment solids du laing et al 2009 gao et al 2021 consequently application of static chemical extraction procedures to investigation of metal mobility in dynamic sediment environments might produce inaccurate results a more direct in situ measurement method is essential for quantitative evaluation of the mobility of sediment cd in the study area 3 3 seasonal variations in dgt labile chemicals seasonal profiles of dgt labile metals and s ii at the four sampling sites are presented in fig 3 overall the dgt labile fe ii mn ii and s ii concentrations cdgt fe cdgt mn cdgt s ii were lower in the overlying water than in sediments fig 3 and table s3 differences in redox conditions between the overlying water and sediments were the main cause of this distribution pattern under oxic and suboxic conditions eh 100 mv iron manganese and sulfur are present mainly in the forms of fe mn oxides and sulfate chen et al 2021 luo et al 2018 otero et al 2009 which cannot be taken up by chelex and agi dgt respectively the vertical distributions of cdgt fe mn and s ii showed synchronous increases below the swi and significantly higher levels in july than in november p 0 05 with the exceptions of cdgt fe at site d1 and cdgt s ii at site x1 according to the ideal reduction order in anaerobic freshwater sediments chemical reactions such as denitrification and reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides occur successively followed by sulfate reduction wersin et al 1991 thus the sediment environment was more reducing in july than in november which was well supported by lower eh values observed near or below the swi fig s1 the dgt labile cd concentrations cdgt cd in sediments showed insignificant differences among the four sites in november but were significantly higher at sites x1 x2 than sites d1 d2 in july p 0 05 table s3 demonstrating a greater release capacity of sediment cd and secondary contamination risk in the xizhi river despite ctotal cd and acid soluble cd proportions being markedly higher in the danshui river p 0 05 fig 2 this indicated that the potential mobility of cd was irrelevant to its total concentration in sediment in line with previous report xu et al 2016 the vertical distribution of cdgt cd at the four sites showed roughly opposite distribution patterns to cdgt fe mn and s ii during both sampling campaigns with a generally decreasing trend from the overlying water to the sediments except at site x1 fig 3 higher cdgt cd 0 025 0 041 µg l 1 at depths of 30 to 50 mm at site x1 corresponded well with the maximum doc values 47 0 162 mg l 1 fig s1 suggesting the release of sediment cd associated with om degradation om is recognized as an important sink for trace metals rapid mineralization leads to the release of cd bound to om and elevated concentrations in surface sediments gao et al 2016 parker et al 2017 a sudden outbreak of cd pollution was found to have resulted mainly from the complexation of om with cd in sediments chen et al 2021 concurrent release of om and cd was likely another driver of this phenomenon as fe mn oxides serve as a strong absorbent for both om and cd in sediment media and are reductively dissolved under anaerobic conditions parker et al 2017 however this inference was contradicted by the negative correlations between labile cd and fe mn p 0 01 or p 0 05 fig s2a and s2b which suggest that the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides is not a reliable proxy for the release of sediment cd in the present study in accordance with a previous report xu et al 2016 negative correlations between labile cd and s ii were identified below the swi in both november p 0 05 and july p 0 01 fig s2c trace levels of sulfides are widely reported to be present in porewater which could preferentially react with cd to form insoluble cds due to its high solubility product constant k sp thereby lowering the cd concentration in the sediment liquid phase to the maximum extent du laing et al 2009 gordon 1951 wang and wang 2017 the cdgt cd in sediment remained at approximately 0 01 µg l 1 in november and increased approximately 2 3 fold at sites x1 and x2 in july despite comparable or higher cdgt s ii levels mean 116 and 185 µg l 1 respectively compared to november 128 and 75 5 µg l 1 table s3 thus it is reasonable to speculate that other chemical reactions or factors in addition to om degradation reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides and sulfate reduction are involved in controlling the cd concentration and mobility 3 4 seasonal variations in the chemical speciation of porewater cd as shown in table 1 the dissolved cd concentrations in porewater cdissolved cd were significantly higher at sites x1 november 0 165 µg l 1 and july 0 121 µg l 1 and x2 0 454 and 0 182 µg l 1 than at sites d1 0 090 and 0 051 µg l 1 and d2 0 049 and 0 097 µg l 1 during both sampling campaigns p 0 05 table 1 the spatial distribution characteristics of cdissolved cd were the inverse of the ctotal cd fig 2 trends the profile of cdissolved cd generally exhibited a decreasing trend at sites d1 and d2 in november whereas it fluctuated near the swi and in the lower portions of cores x1 and x2 fig 4 in july cdissolved cd remained relatively constant in all sediment cores with some peaks occurring near the swi depth 0 40 mm at sites x1 and x2 according to the ratio of cdgt cd and cdissolved cd r the capacity of the sediment solid phase for resupply of cd to the porewater can be classified into three cases fully sustained r 0 9 partially sustained 0 1 r 0 9 and simple diffusion without resupply r 0 1 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 1998 in the present study the mean r values below the swi were 0 077 0 058 and 0 077 at sites x1 x2 and d1 in november which increased to 0 195 0 236 and 0 189 in july p 0 05 table 1 and fig s3 illustrating a significant increase in the resupply capacity from simple diffusion to partial buffering by the sediment solid phase induced by dgt uptake at these sites however a slight decrease in resupply was found at site d2 even though cdissolved cd increased by about 2 fold table 1 the predicted cd speciation and relative proportions obtained from visual minteq are summarized in table 1 fig 4 and s4 in november average free cd2 accounted for most of cdissolved cd in the overlying water 43 0 followed by cd s complexes 33 2 cd fa complexes 13 3 other cd inorganic complexes 9 0 and cd ha complexes 1 4 generally free cd2 was the main species in river water with low sulfide and doc concentrations balistrieri and blank 2008 sierra et al 2017 in july cd s species accounted for more than 97 of the cdissolved cd in the overlying water due to the abundance of cdgt s ii at sites x1 x2 d1 and d2 which averaged 4 2 507 311 and 21 0 times higher than in november respectively table s3 in the porewater cd s complexes in the forms of cd hs 2 aq and cdhs were the most abundant with mean percentages ranging from 54 6 to 90 8 at the four sites in both sampling campaigns except at site d1 in november 39 9 table 1 at site d1 the average proportions of cd species decreased in the order of organic fa ha complexes 42 5 s complexes 39 9 free ion 9 6 other inorganic complexes 8 0 in the absence of sulfides cd tends to bind to doc and form relatively stable organic complexes omanovic et al 2015 in sulfidized sediments cd more readily bound to sulfide complexes regardless of whether doc was input into the model charriau et al 2011 these findings could explain the proportions of cd s complexes in both the overlying and porewater being higher in july as well as the apparent increase in cd organic complexes observed in the more weakly reducing environment in november table 1 and fig s4 thus distinctly higher proportions of free cd2 at sites x1 and x2 compared to the other sites were attributed in part to lower levels of inorganic and organic ligands in the porewater furthermore a drop in porewater ph at these two sites resulted from strong sulfide oxidation in july might be another important driver of the increase in predicted free cd2 as the negative surface charges of doc clay minerals and fe mn oxides are reduced under acidic conditions enabling trace metals that were previously co precipitated with carbonates and sulfides to become more soluble and mobile du laing et al 2009 gao et al 2016 3 5 identification of factors influencing cd mobility in sediment correlation analysis between cdgt cd and cdissolved cd predicted cd speciation in the porewater total cd concentration and cd geochemical fractions in sediments was conducted to identify the key factors that influence seasonal variations in cd mobility in sediments as shown in table s4 cdgt cd was weakly related to cdissolved cd in the porewater and negatively associated with ctotal cd during both the november p 0 05 and july p 0 01 sampling campaigns these results strongly reflected the seasonal variation characteristics of cd mobility which were independent of the total and dissolved cd concentrations in both sediment and porewater some researchers have reported significant positive correlation between cdgt cd and cd in the f1 fraction based on the bcr procedure indicating that cd taken up by dgt was sourced mainly from acid soluble cd in the sediment solid phase song et al 2020 xu et al 2016 in the present study the relationships between cdgt cd and the geochemical fractions of sediment cd were relatively weak in november whereas significantly negative correlations were observed in july p 0 01 table s4 these negative correlations were likely related to the observed decrease in porewater ph at sites x1 and x2 in july where sediments had lower ctotal cd compared to sites d1 and d2 but released more cd for uptake by dgt figs 2 3 and s1 in this case dgt labile cd might be derived not only from the acid soluble cd fraction but also from both the reducible and oxidizable cd fractions due to their concurrent dissolution from the solid phase under acidic conditions du laing et al 2009 in aqueous environments the most labile species mls including free cd2 cd inorganic complexes and cd weakly bound to organic complexes can be directly captured by chelex dgt whereas cd s complexes are considered nonlabile due to their small rate constants for dissociation sierra et al 2017 zhang and millero 1994 as shown in table s4 negative correlations of cdgt cd with cd fa and cd ha complexes p 0 05 or p 0 05 revealed apparent competitive binding of cd between chelex gel and organic complexes the correlations between cdgt cd and predicted cd speciation are illustrated in fig 5 in november most data are distributed above the 1 1 line of cdgt cd and free cd2 with a mean ratio of 2 47 fig 5a suggesting that free cd2 could be preferentially taken up by dgt when the presence of other cd inorganic and organic complexes was considered almost all data moved below the 1 1 line with a mean ratio of 0 46 fig 5b illustrating that some inorganic and organic complexes might contribute to cd accumulation on the dgt binding gel this situation appeared more realistic and reasonable because inorganic complexes e g cdno3 cdcl2 aq and cdcl and labile organic complexes could be captured by chelex dgt unsworth et al 2005 as shown in fig 5c and 5d the distribution patterns of data from sites d1 and d2 in july and november are similar interestingly regardless of whether cd inorganic and cd organic complexes were taken into account most data from site x1 fell below the 1 1 line suggesting that the most labile cd species were not bound by chelex gels meanwhile data from site x2 were plotted above the line indicating that the cd species present at that site could be completely captured by dgt these findings were likely associated with the decrease in porewater ph at these two sites in july fig s1 which promoted the desorption of metals from the solid phase and the disassociation of both inorganic and organic complexes as well as possibly s complexes under acidic conditions this finding is supported by elevated concentration ratios 5 82 and 2 57 between cdgt cd and free cd2 mls meanwhile strongly acidic conditions i e ph 5 reduced the binding efficiency of chelex resin for cationic ions resulting in a steeply decreasing trend of cd recovery by chelex dgt in solution zhang and davison 1995 the distinct difference in acid base properties of the porewater between sites x1 ph 5 1 0 5 and x2 ph 5 8 0 4 fig s1 was likely the key driver of their specific distribution patterns another possible explanation for the symbols plotted below the 1 1 line based on the sampling theory of dgt is that cdgt s ii was lower than the concentration of dissolved sulfides in the porewater to various degrees zhang et al 1998 leading to underestimation of the proportion of cd s complexes and thus overestimation of other cd species due to the strong competitive binding ability of sulfides to dissolved cd overall the significantly positive correlation between cdgt cd and predicted free cd2 mls p 0 05 fig 4c and 4d demonstrated a marked increase in cd mobility in july fig 6 3 6 diffusive fluxes and environmental implications of various cd species at the swi to identify the source sink phases of cd between the sediment and water column in different seasons diffusive fluxes of total dissolved cd across the swi were estimated based on eq 3 the migration characteristics of various cd species were also quantified to reveal their potential transformation behavior upon a change in environmental media as depicted in fig 5 negative diffusive flux indicates downward migration of cd from the overlying water to the sediment whereas positive values represent the release of cd from the sediment the total diffusive fluxes of cd were 0 06 µg m 2 d 1 at x1 0 19 µg m 2 d 1 at d1 and 0 27 µg m 2 d 1 at d2 in november generally indicating a sink role of the sediment for cd with the exception of site x2 0 17 µg m 2 d 1 fig 5a in july the sediment s role shifted to a source of cd to the water column with upward fluxes of 0 02 0 39 µg m 2 d 1 fig 5b the seasonal conversion of cd between source and sink phases at the swi could be explained by the following factors first the danshui river and lower reaches of the xizhi river have been subjected to continuous contamination with trace metals wang et al 2015 and weaker reductive conditions in november fig 2 and s1 likely favored the formation of fe mn oxides in surface sediments thereby sequestering cd that diffuses near the swi chen et al 2021 in this case cd contamination of the overlying water induces downward diffusive fluxes second dilution effects of precipitation on the river and cd remobilization associated with sulfide oxidation in sediments in july fig 3 and 4 supported upward concentration gradients leading to the release of sediment cd notably the highest efflux of cd observed at site x1 near the outlet of the xizhi river might cause a secondary contamination risk for water source areas in summer as far as we know this is the first report to quantitatively describe the migration characteristics of a metal with multiple chemical forms at the swi in november mean fluxes were 0 09 µg m 2 d 1 for free cd2 0 01 µg m 2 d 1 for cd s complexes 0 03 µg m 2 d 1 for other cd inorganic complexes and 0 01 µg m 2 d 1 for cd fa complexes and the migration of cd ha complexes was negligible cd in the overlying water diffused primarily into sediments as free ions and inorganic complexes whereas cd was present mainly as sulfides and fa complexes which were released back into the river water especially at sites x2 and d1 fig 5a this phenomenon was related to the change in cd speciation near the swi caused by marked differences between the overlying water and sediment media when downward diffusing free cd2 or cd inorganic complexes excluding sulfide complexes migrated through the swi they readily bound to sulfides and organic complexes once a sufficiently strong concentration gradient formed near the swi dissolved cd in surface sediments could diffuse toward the water column in the form of cd s and cd organic complexes despite their low bioavailability and or mobility in july sediment cd was released mainly as free ions sulfide complexes and other inorganic complexes with mean fluxes of 0 01 0 11 and 0 01 µg m 2 d 1 respectively and fluxes of cd organic complexes were extremely low fig 5b in this scenario released free cd2 and inorganic species were prone to re adsorption onto suspended particulate matter or binding to fe mn oxides in oxic river water fig s1 followed by re deposition in the sediment gao et al 2017 turner et al 2008 zheng et al 2013 in contrast cd s complexes mainly in the forms of cd hs 2 aq and cdhs that diffused into the overlying water had high migration potentials as cd bound to sulfide complexes becomes active after the sulfides undergo complete oxidation under aerobic conditions chen et al 2021 before that transition cd s complexes could remain in the dissolved form and continually migrate to lower reaches of the river driven by the hydraulic gradient 4 conclusion this study integrated chemical sequential extraction procedures in situ passive sampling techniques dgt and hr peeper and a thermodynamic chemical equilibrium model to investigate the seasonal variations of cd mobility in sediments of the xizhi river basin sediments with greater ctotal cd and proportions of nominally active fractions f1 f2 and f3 at sites d1 and d2 exhibited lower cd lability than sediments at sites x1 and x2 where higher cdgt cd and cdissolved cd were measured in both sampling campaigns degradation of organic matter was identified as a potential factor leading to the localized release of sediment cd in contrast to other reports reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides likely contributed little to the release of sediment cd in the present study instead sulfide oxidation was identified as the main cause of differences in cd mobility between seasons and among sampling sites evaluation of metal mobility based on chemical extraction might be inaccurate in the dynamic sediment environment according to the results of cd speciation prediction in the porewater cd s complexes were the dominant form present during both sampling campaigns and these complexes were likely nonlabile for chelex dgt devices under neutral conditions free cd2 cd organic complexes and other cd inorganic complexes were the major components preferentially taken up by dgt in winter meanwhile a drop in ph induced by sulfide oxidation facilitated a marked release of sediment cd and the uptake of porewater cd possibly including cd s complex species by dgt in summer a strongly acidic environment e g ph 5 1 0 5 at site x1 in july might reduce the binding efficiency of dgt resulting in underestimation of cd mobility in sediment generally sediments in the study area acted as a sink of cd to the water column in winter and this role shifted to a source of cd in summer moreover sediment cd was released mainly in cd s complexes which exhibit greater migration potentials than free cd2 and other inorganic species especially near the outlet of the xizhi river thus the xizhi river basin has likely suffered from a long term risk of secondary contamination due to periodic release of sediment cd importantly the environmental safety of the lower reaches which are water source areas in

16478,understanding the speciation and mobilization mechanisms of potentially toxic metals in sediments is critical to aquatic ecosystem health and contamination remediation in urban rivers in this study chemical sequential extraction a thermodynamic chemical equilibrium model visual minteq ver 3 1 diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and high resolution dialysis hr peeper techniques were integrated to identify seasonal variations in cadmium cd mobility in sulfidized sediments acid soluble cd was the dominant geochemical fraction in sediments followed by residual oxidizable and reducible cd the dgt labile cd concentration was associated with various geochemical processes and was independent of the total concentration and geochemical fractionation of cd in sediments sulfate reduction facilitated the formation of insoluble cds and induced low cd concentrations in sediment porewater sulfide oxidation was principally responsible for lowered porewater ph and elevated cd concentrations in summer strongly acidic conditions promoted release of sediment cd but might reduce the binding efficiency of chelex resin gel for dissolved cd leading to underestimation of the mobility of sediment cd sediments generally functioned as a sink for cd in winter and shifted to acting as a source in summer releasing cd into the overlying water mainly as cd s complexes with high potential to migrate downstream graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords diffusive flux mobilization mechanisms sediment water interface speciation modeling sulfide oxidation 1 introduction cadmium cd one of the most toxic and carcinogenic chemical elements is a widespread contaminant in the environment worldwide balistrieri and blank 2008 usepa 1989 trace cd concentrations in environmental media can exert acute or chronic toxic effects on organisms and threaten human health via bioaccumulation in food webs croteau et al 2005 zhang and reynolds 2019 due to the deleterious impacts of cd it has been listed as a priority contaminant by the united states and the european union claudia 1993 the european parliament and the council of the european union 2013 in aquatic environments dissolved cd derived from anthropogenic discharge tends to adsorb onto suspended particles followed by deposition in sediments which are generally considered a major sink for metals gao et al 2016 zheng et al 2013 in turn sediment can act as an important cd source in the water column due to resuspension and changes in physico chemical conditions caetano et al 2003 xu et al 2016 with such changes release of sediment cd might lead to secondary contamination of the overlying water posing risks to aquatic organisms and domestic water supplies consequently seasonal release characteristics and remobilization mechanisms of sediment cd have attracted considerable concern worldwide the chemical sequential extraction procedure developed by the european community bureau of reference bcr has been intensively utilized to explore the mobility and bioavailability of trace metals in sediments gao et al 2018 gao et al 2017 however this traditional research approach has been reported to have two major deficiencies analytical errors resulting from changes in the chemical properties of sediment samples during transportation storage and pretreatment processes and overestimation of metal mobility induced by advanced leaching of acid volatile sulfide bound metals during the extraction process billon et al 2001 therefore passive sampling techniques such as diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and high resolution dialysis hr peeper have been conducted in situ for measurement of labile species and the concentrations of dissolved target chemicals respectively chen et al 2021 li et al 2021 zhang et al 1998 recently the chelex dgt probe has been widely employed to identify key factors and characterize the effects of geochemical cycling of crucial elements on the mobility of cd in sediments or soils based on field monitoring campaigns some reports have indicated that differences in physico chemical properties including cation exchange capacity cec ph and grain size composition of soils affect the distribution characteristics of cd between the solid and liquid phases as well as its mobilization potential muhammad et al 2012 perez and anderson 2009 for sediment rapid degradation of organic matter om and reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides were found to be mainly responsible for the remobilization and release of cd chen et al 2021 parker et al 2017 in the presence of trace levels of sulfides in sediment porewater cd tends to be immobilized due to the formation of insoluble cds wang and wang 2017 application of chelex and agi dgt probes revealed concurrent release of cd and sulfides confirming the vital role of sulfur cycling in controlling cd mobility in sediments zhang et al 2020b furthermore in dgt assembly of diffusive gel layers with various pore sizes allows for the direct measurement of labile inorganically and organically bound cd species in natural waters zhang and davison 2000 however dgt measurements are unsuitable for the quantitative determination of various labile cd species in complex aqueous environments due to the large uncertainties surrounding ligand composition in general dissolved trace metals are present in a variety of chemical forms or species with marked differences in bioavailability and mobility depending on the physico chemical properties and ligands therefore thermodynamic chemical equilibrium models such as visual minteq and wham have been used to predict metal speciation in various water bodies charriau et al 2011 unsworth et al 2005 the results showed that the predicted concentrations of cd2 and cdcl species decreased with increasing salinity leading to the formation of cdcl2 in the overlaying water column whereas dissolved cd tended to complex with sulfides in sediment porewater charriau et al 2011 ramteke et al 2021 when dissolved organic matter was taken into account the contribution of free cd2 to dissolved cd decreased as calculated using visual minteq cornu et al 2009 in neutralized acid mine drainage namd water the dissolved cd consisting principally of labile species sum of free ion and inorganic and weak organic complexes was roughly equivalent to the dgt measured cd indicating that the dissolved cd was fully available for dgt uptake omanovic et al 2015 in contrast complexation of humic substances with cd may result in low uptake of cd by dgt in freshwater sierra et al 2017 various physico chemical properties of the aquatic environment can affect the chemical speciation characteristics of dissolved cd altering its migration potential as assessed by dgt integrating dgt measurement into chemical speciation modeling can facilitate establishment of linkages between labile metal species e g free ion and inorganic and weak organic complexes and the fraction measured by dgt to elucidate the remobilization mechanisms of sediment metals fick s first law of diffusion has been broadly applied to estimation of the diffusive flux of individual metals across the sediment water interface swi for identification of sources and sinks blasco et al 2000 however estimation based on the total concentrations of dissolved cd might be problematic due to apparent differences in diffusion coefficients between cd inorganic and cd organic complexes in aqueous environments zhang and davison 1999 estimation of individual cd species can eliminate such errors enabling precise quantification of cd flux at the swi with an area of 56 000 km2 and a population of more than 70 million the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba located in the pearl river estuary in south china is one of the four largest bay areas worldwide in terms of gross domestic production due to the rapid urbanization and social economic development that has occurred since the 1990s the gba has suffered from serious trace metal contamination associated with anthropogenic discharge particularly riverine sediment contamination with the toxic element cd gao et al 2021 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2015 based on hypotheses of seasonal cycling of cd source and sink phases between the sediment and water column resulting from changes in natural conditions and the impacts of anthropogenic activities this study selected the highly urbanized xizhi river basin located near an important water source area in the gba as a study area to reveal the seasonal characteristics of cd migration and immobilization behaviors in sediment identify key driving factors or geochemical reactions that control remobilization of sediment cd and quantify the migration processes of various chemical forms of cd across the swi 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area and sampling site the xizhi river located on the southeast side of the gba in south china is 176 km long and has a catchment area of 4120 km2 fig 1 the river originates from the baipenzhu reservoir and is the second largest tributary of the dongjiang river a crucial domestic water source for several megacities including huizhou shenzhen and dongguan the xizhi river watershed has a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean precipitation from 1545 to 1989 mm and the majority of the rainfall approximately 80 occurs during the wet season from april to september the danshui river is a tributary of the xizhi river arising from the wutong mountains in shenzhen city it flows through industrial areas for electroplating and the manufacture of metallic equipment and machinery which are intensively distributed in the longang and huiyang districts and drains into the xizhi river in the densely populated huicheng district of huizhou city fig 1 previous research indicated that the discharge of industrial effluent was mainly responsible for source of severe trace metal e g cu zn and ni contamination in river water and considerable enrichment in riverine sediments which poses serious threats to the downstream aquatic ecosystem and water resources wang et al 2015 the sampling sites d1 and d2 used in the present study are located on the lower and upper reaches of the danshui river respectively site x2 is situated at the upper reach of the confluence zone of the danshui river and can be considered a reference site due to its lower concentrations of trace metals and nutrients in sediments gao et al 2021 li et al 2021 site x1 located at the outlet of the xizhi river was used to reveal the potential impacts of cd release from sediments on a water source area 2 2 collection and storage of sediment core samples a gravity sampler equipped with a polycarbonate tube was employed to collect sediment core samples duplicate sediment cores of similar lengths with a diameter of approximately 65 mm were collected at each site in november 2019 and july 2020 representing the winter and summer seasons all sediment cores containing overlying water were wrapped immediately with aluminum foil to protect the samples from sunlight after transportation to the laboratory sediment cores were equilibrated in a thermostatic incubator at a temperature determined during field investigations and used for dgt and hr peeper probes deployment 2 3 deployment and analysis of dgt and hr peeper probes flat chelex agi dgt probes with an exposure area of 150 mm height 18 mm width and an hr peeper with a total exposure area of 200 mm height 40 mm width purchased from www dgtresearch com cn and www easysensor net respectively were applied to reveal seasonal variations in the vertical distribution patterns of target chemicals all dgt and hr peeper probes were deoxygenated prior to use a small mark was made on all probes to indicate the height of 20 mm above the sediment water interface swi then the hr peeper probe was gradually inserted into one sediment core until the mark reached the swi the chelex and agi dgt probes were bound back to back and inserted into another sediment core sediment cores containing dgt and hr peeper probes were incubated without light at a specific temperature determined during the field investigation dgt and hr peeper probes were retrieved after 24 and 48 h respectively and thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water prior to subsequent analysis the hr peeper probe is composed of 36 chambers arranged vertically each of which has an exposure area of 4 mm height 40 mm width and contains 0 4 ml of milli q water after passive sampling the water samples in the chambers were collected using a pipette at 10 mm intervals and acidified with 40 µl of 0 1 m hcl followed by dilution to 8 ml with ultrapure water then concentrations of metals cu zn ni pb cd k na ca mg fe mn and al were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms x 2 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa or inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes iris pleasant prairie wi usa 10 of samples were randomly selected for duplicate analysis and the standard deviation of analysis results was less than 15 recoveries of standard solution with different cd concentrations were in range of 93 2 106 during icp ms analysis the dgt analysis and calculation processes have been described previously ding et al 2012 xu et al 2016 zhang and davison 1995 and are presented in the supporting information si 2 4 thermodynamic modeling of cd speciation in water samples speciation modeling of cd in water samples at four sites was performed using the thermodynamic chemical equilibrium model visual minteq ver 3 1 gustafsson 2013 the input parameters included basic physico

play a crucial role in controlling the chemical speciation bioavailability and fate of trace metals in aquatic environments omanovic et al 2015 zhang and davison 2000 to assess interactions of metals with hs the stockholm humic model shm which employs a discrete distribution of binding sites was adopted to describe proton and cationic metal binding to hs gustafsson 2001 hs are assumed to account for 70 of organic carbon oc and contain 50 carbon and therefore the concentration of hs was defined as 1 4 times the doc concentration charriau et al 2011 han et al 2014 during cd speciation simulation a ratio of 9 1 between fa and ha was applied as this ratio was considered representative of conditions in freshwater han et al 2013 sierra et al 2017 zhang 2004 additionally colloidal components such as colloidal iron iii and aluminum iii oxyhydroxides were excluded from the modeling process due to the difficulty of measurement under anoxic conditions charriau et al 2011 2 5 total concentration and geochemical fractionation of sediment cd approximately 50 mg of pretreated sediment sample was digested in an hno3 hf mixture in a teflon tube and the cd concentration was measured using icp ms a modified bcr procedure was adopted for determination of the acid soluble f1 reducible f2 and oxidizable f3 fractions of sediment cd the residual fraction f4 was calculated by subtracting the first three fractions f1 f2 f3 from the total cd concentration measured full details of the modified bcr procedure can be found in our previous reports gao et al 2021 gao et al 2018 quality assurance and quality control qa qc was conducted during measurement using a standard reference material bcr 701 and method blank the recoveries of the total cd concentration and geochemical fractions were 92 4 0 93 total cd 101 0 7 f1 81 3 1 34 f2 87 4 7 1 f3 and 102 13 2 f4 in addition 10 of sediment samples were randomly selected for duplicate measurements and the standard deviation of analysis results was less than 10 2 6 estimation for diffusive flux of cd at the swi based on the measured total cd concentration and predicted cd speciation in the overlying water and porewater a benthic exchange flux model based on fick s first law of diffusion eq 1 blasco et al 2000 can be used to estimate the diffusive flux of cd at the swi 1 j φ d s δ c δ z x 0 2 d s d w φ f where j is the diffusive flux of the chemical at the swi µg m 2 d 1 d w and d s are the diffusion coefficients of the chemical in water and sediment cm2 s 1 respectively based on the porosity φ and formation resistivity factor f of the sediment ds can be determined using eq 2 f 1 φ 3 when φ 0 7 otherwise f 1 φ 2 li and gregory 1974 δc δz x 0 represents the concentration gradient of the chemical at the swi µg l 1 cm 1 and was derived through linear fitting of the vertical distribution of the chemical near the swi to quantify the migration direction and flux of various cd species at the swi eq 1 can be decomposed into the sum of fluxes of cd2 cd s cd inorganic excluding cd s species cd fa and cd ha complexes which is presented as eq 3 3 j φ d s ion δ c ion δ z x 0 φ d s s δ c s δ z x 0 φ d s inorg δ

complexes and cd ha complexes in sediment cm2 s 1 respectively in the present study ds ion ds s and ds inorg were assumed to be equal and were calculated based on d w which is provided in the manufacturer s operating guide dw fa and dw ha are 2 46 10 6 and 1 79 10 6 cm2 s 1 in water at 20 c zhang and davison 1999 respectively and these values were applied in the determination of ds fa and ds ha 2 7 statistical analysis the arcmap raster calculator arcgis 10 3 esri was used to transform the grayscale intensity of colored agi gels into the accumulated mass of s ii per unit area and then estimate the concentration profiles of dgt labile s ii at a 10 mm interval normal distribution testing of the dataset was conducted prior to statistical analysis as not all of the data set satisfied the normal distribution characteristics the nonparametric kruskal wallis h test and mann whitney u test were adopted to reveal differences in various variables among the four sampling sites and between the two sampling periods respectively the nonparametric spearman s correlation was used to identify the relationships among sediment physico chemical properties geochemical fractions of sediment cd dgt labile chemicals and predicted cd species differences and correlations were considered significant at p 0 05 all statistical analysis were performed using spss software ver 16 0 for windows 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical properties of water and sediment samples basic physico chemical parameters of the overlying water collected from the xizhi river and the danshui river are summarized in table s1 of the si the river water temperatures were 24 2 25 6 c in november and 29 7 34 4 c in july with mean dissolved oxygen do concentrations of 6 81 mg l 1 and 5 64 mg l 1 respectively the electrical conductivity ec exhibited a decreasing tendency from the danshui river 279 750 µs cm 1 to the lower reach of the xizhi river site x1 310 and 263 µs cm 1 with exception of site x2 71 3 and 72 0 µs cm 1 the dilution effect of precipitation in rainy seasons was the main driver of lower ec values in july mean 248 µs cm 1 than in november 431 µs cm 1 the dilution effect might be also an important driver of lower no3 levels in the river water in july mean 3 8 mg l 1 compared to november 18 7 mg l 1 however the decrease in no3 concentrations was partly attributed to bacteria mediated denitrification reactions which occur readily at relatively high water temperatures he et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a as shown in fig s1 the acid base property of the overlying water and porewater was slightly alkaline with a ph range of 7 00 8 39 among the four sampling sites in november in july the porewater ph was lower and equal across all depths at sites d1 and d2 whereas a decreasing trend with depth was observed at sites x1 4 56 6 34 and x2 5 45 6 43 reflecting the acidity of the porewater to various extents doc profiles were generally stable except for site x1 in july where the doc concentration peaked 162 mg l 1 between depths of 30 and 70 mm so4 2 decreased markedly with depth and remained at the µg l 1 level in the bottom porewater in november in the sediment environment early diagenesis driven by oc mineralization can cause conversion from oxic to anoxic conditions promoting a series of reduction reactions including sulfate reduction gao et al 2020 wang and wang 2017 this shift can be evidenced by a steep drop in the redox potential relative to the overlying water toward sediments and negative eh values below the swi fig s1 however so4 2 concentrations showed increasing trends below the swi or the depth of 50 mm at all sites in july previous reports have indicated that acid volatile sulfide avs can be oxidized to sulfates accompanying with production of h after sediment resuspension leading to severe acidification of sediment with ph 5 table s2 burton et al 2006 karimian et al 2017 richards et al 2018 shipley et al 2011 in addition nitrate was reported to serve as an electron acceptor to oxidize sulfides to sulfates concurrent with acidity generation table s2 he et al 2017 consequently avs oxidation induced by sediment resuspension during flood seasons might be responsible mainly for so4 2 enrichment in sediments and the marked decrease of porewater ph at sites x1 and x2 in july fig s1 at which sediments had insufficient hco3 to buffer generated h additionally sulfides oxidation driven by denitrification supposed to be another potential cause due to pronounced depletion of no3 in porewater fig s1 and table s2 3 2 total concentration and geochemical fractionation of sediment cd the spatial distribution characteristics and geochemical fractions of sediment cd at four sampling sites are presented in fig 2 the total cd concentration in sediments ctotal cd was significantly higher in samples collected from the danshui river d1 2 45 0 83 mg kg 1 and d2 3 36 1 34 mg kg 1 than those from the xizhi river x1 0 49 0 12 mg kg 1 and x2 0 49 0 08 mg kg 1 p 0 05 previous research indicated that the discharge of electroplating wastewater is the main driver of the moderate to heavy accumulation of trace metals in sediments of the danshui river wang et al 2015 overall the average proportions of the various geochemical fractions of sediment cd followed the descending order of acid soluble 46 8 10 5 residual 21 8 7 2 oxidizable 18 5 9 3 reducible 12 8 3 9 cd in fraction f1 was readily desorbed from sediment solids through ion exchange or dissolution under weakly acidic conditions as it is present as free ions that exhibit strong mobility gao et al 2018 reducible cd was generally bound to amorphous fe mn oxides which could be mobilized through dissolution of fe mn oxides under reducing conditions xu et al 2016 the cd in fraction f3 was mainly bound to organic matter om and sulfides and could be released from sediment grains during the decomposition of om or sulfide oxidation in an oxidizing environment du laing et al 2009 thus sediment cd release potential generally decreased in the order of sites d2 d1 x1 x2 according to their acid soluble cd f1 concentrations fig 2 however a previous report noted that abundant acid volatile sulfides avs can be dissolved during first step extraction f1 of sulfidized sediments inducing rapid release of metals formerly bound to sulfides billon et al 2001 additionally changes in the physico chemical properties e g t ph eh and doc of the aquatic environment induced by seasonal variations and anthropogenic activities could apparently affect the solid liquid phase partitioning of metals thereby impacting the source of metals released from sediment solids du laing et al 2009 gao et al 2021 consequently application of static chemical extraction procedures to investigation of metal mobility in dynamic sediment environments might produce inaccurate results a more direct in situ measurement method is essential for quantitative evaluation of the mobility of sediment cd in the study area 3 3 seasonal variations in dgt labile chemicals seasonal profiles of dgt labile metals and s ii at the four sampling sites are presented in fig 3 overall the dgt labile fe ii mn ii and s ii concentrations cdgt fe cdgt mn cdgt s ii were lower in the overlying water than in sediments fig 3 and table s3 differences in redox conditions between the overlying water and sediments were the main cause of this distribution pattern under oxic and suboxic conditions eh 100 mv iron manganese and sulfur are present mainly in the forms of fe mn oxides and sulfate chen et al 2021 luo et al 2018 otero et al 2009 which cannot be taken up by chelex and agi dgt respectively the vertical distributions of cdgt fe mn and s ii showed synchronous increases below the swi and significantly higher levels in july than in november p 0 05 with the exceptions of cdgt fe at site d1 and cdgt s ii at site x1 according to the ideal reduction order in anaerobic freshwater sediments chemical reactions such as denitrification and reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides occur successively followed by sulfate reduction wersin et al 1991 thus the sediment environment was more reducing in july than in november which was well supported by lower eh values observed near or below the swi fig s1 the dgt labile cd concentrations cdgt cd in sediments showed insignificant differences among the four sites in november but were significantly higher at sites x1 x2 than sites d1 d2 in july p 0 05 table s3 demonstrating a greater release capacity of sediment cd and secondary contamination risk in the xizhi river despite ctotal cd and acid soluble cd proportions being markedly higher in the danshui river p 0 05 fig 2 this indicated that the potential mobility of cd was irrelevant to its total concentration in sediment in line with previous report xu et al 2016 the vertical distribution of cdgt cd at the four sites showed roughly opposite distribution patterns to cdgt fe mn and s ii during both sampling campaigns with a generally decreasing trend from the overlying water to the sediments except at site x1 fig 3 higher cdgt cd 0 025 0 041 µg l 1 at depths of 30 to 50 mm at site x1 corresponded well with the maximum doc values 47 0 162 mg l 1 fig s1 suggesting the release of sediment cd associated with om degradation om is recognized as an important sink for trace metals rapid mineralization leads to the release of cd bound to om and elevated concentrations in surface sediments gao et al 2016 parker et al 2017 a sudden outbreak of cd pollution was found to have resulted mainly from the complexation of om with cd in sediments chen et al 2021 concurrent release of om and cd was likely another driver of this phenomenon as fe mn oxides serve as a strong absorbent for both om and cd in sediment media and are reductively dissolved under anaerobic conditions parker et al 2017 however this inference was contradicted by the negative correlations between labile cd and fe mn p 0 01 or p 0 05 fig s2a and s2b which suggest that the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides is not a reliable proxy for the release of sediment cd in the present study in accordance with a previous report xu et al 2016 negative correlations between labile cd and s ii were identified below the swi in both november p 0 05 and july p 0 01 fig s2c trace levels of sulfides are widely reported to be present in porewater which could preferentially react with cd to form insoluble cds due to its high solubility product constant k sp thereby lowering the cd concentration in the sediment liquid phase to the maximum extent du laing et al 2009 gordon 1951 wang and wang 2017 the cdgt cd in sediment remained at approximately 0 01 µg l 1 in november and increased approximately 2 3 fold at sites x1 and x2 in july despite comparable or higher cdgt s ii levels mean 116 and 185 µg l 1 respectively compared to november 128 and 75 5 µg l 1 table s3 thus it is reasonable to speculate that other chemical reactions or factors in addition to om degradation reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides and sulfate reduction are involved in controlling the cd concentration and mobility 3 4 seasonal variations in the chemical speciation of porewater cd as shown in table 1 the dissolved cd concentrations in porewater cdissolved cd were significantly higher at sites x1 november 0 165 µg l 1 and july 0 121 µg l 1 and x2 0 454 and 0 182 µg l 1 than at sites d1 0 090 and 0 051 µg l 1 and d2 0 049 and 0 097 µg l 1 during both sampling campaigns p 0 05 table 1 the spatial distribution characteristics of cdissolved cd were the inverse of the ctotal cd fig 2 trends the profile of cdissolved cd generally exhibited a decreasing trend at sites d1 and d2 in november whereas it fluctuated near the swi and in the lower portions of cores x1 and x2 fig 4 in july cdissolved cd remained relatively constant in all sediment cores with some peaks occurring near the swi depth 0 40 mm at sites x1 and x2 according to the ratio of cdgt cd and cdissolved cd r the capacity of the sediment solid phase for resupply of cd to the porewater can be classified into three cases fully sustained r 0 9 partially sustained 0 1 r 0 9 and simple diffusion without resupply r 0 1 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 1998 in the present study the mean r values below the swi were 0 077 0 058 and 0 077 at sites x1 x2 and d1 in november which increased to 0 195 0 236 and 0 189 in july p 0 05 table 1 and fig s3 illustrating a significant increase in the resupply capacity from simple diffusion to partial buffering by the sediment solid phase induced by dgt uptake at these sites however a slight decrease in resupply was found at site d2 even though cdissolved cd increased by about 2 fold table 1 the predicted cd speciation and relative proportions obtained from visual minteq are summarized in table 1 fig 4 and s4 in november average free cd2 accounted for most of cdissolved cd in the overlying water 43 0 followed by cd s complexes 33 2 cd fa complexes 13 3 other cd inorganic complexes 9 0 and cd ha complexes 1 4 generally free cd2 was the main species in river water with low sulfide and doc concentrations balistrieri and blank 2008 sierra et al 2017 in july cd s species accounted for more than 97 of the cdissolved cd in the overlying water due to the abundance of cdgt s ii at sites x1 x2 d1 and d2 which averaged 4 2 507 311 and 21 0 times higher than in november respectively table s3 in the porewater cd s complexes in the forms of cd hs 2 aq and cdhs were the most abundant with mean percentages ranging from 54 6 to 90 8 at the four sites in both sampling campaigns except at site d1 in november 39 9 table 1 at site d1 the average proportions of cd species decreased in the order of organic fa ha complexes 42 5 s complexes 39 9 free ion 9 6 other inorganic complexes 8 0 in the absence of sulfides cd tends to bind to doc and form relatively stable organic complexes omanovic et al 2015 in sulfidized sediments cd more readily bound to sulfide complexes regardless of whether doc was input into the model charriau et al 2011 these findings could explain the proportions of cd s complexes in both the overlying and porewater being higher in july as well as the apparent increase in cd organic complexes observed in the more weakly reducing environment in november table 1 and fig s4 thus distinctly higher proportions of free cd2 at sites x1 and x2 compared to the other sites were attributed in part to lower levels of inorganic and organic ligands in the porewater furthermore a drop in porewater ph at these two sites resulted from strong sulfide oxidation in july might be another important driver of the increase in predicted free cd2 as the negative surface charges of doc clay minerals and fe mn oxides are reduced under acidic conditions enabling trace metals that were previously co precipitated with carbonates and sulfides to become more soluble and mobile du laing et al 2009 gao et al 2016 3 5 identification of factors influencing cd mobility in sediment correlation analysis between cdgt cd and cdissolved cd predicted cd speciation in the porewater total cd concentration and cd geochemical fractions in sediments was conducted to identify the key factors that influence seasonal variations in cd mobility in sediments as shown in table s4 cdgt cd was weakly related to cdissolved cd in the porewater and negatively associated with ctotal cd during both the november p 0 05 and july p 0 01 sampling campaigns these results strongly reflected the seasonal variation characteristics of cd mobility which were independent of the total and dissolved cd concentrations in both sediment and porewater some researchers have reported significant positive correlation between cdgt cd and cd in the f1 fraction based on the bcr procedure indicating that cd taken up by dgt was sourced mainly from acid soluble cd in the sediment solid phase song et al 2020 xu et al 2016 in the present study the relationships between cdgt cd and the geochemical fractions of sediment cd were relatively weak in november whereas significantly negative correlations were observed in july p 0 01 table s4 these negative correlations were likely related to the observed decrease in porewater ph at sites x1 and x2 in july where sediments had lower ctotal cd compared to sites d1 and d2 but released more cd for uptake by dgt figs 2 3 and s1 in this case dgt labile cd might be derived not only from the acid soluble cd fraction but also from both the reducible and oxidizable cd fractions due to their concurrent dissolution from the solid phase under acidic conditions du laing et al 2009 in aqueous environments the most labile species mls including free cd2 cd inorganic complexes and cd weakly bound to organic complexes can be directly captured by chelex dgt whereas cd s complexes are considered nonlabile due to their small rate constants for dissociation sierra et al 2017 zhang and millero 1994 as shown in table s4 negative correlations of cdgt cd with cd fa and cd ha complexes p 0 05 or p 0 05 revealed apparent competitive binding of cd between chelex gel and organic complexes the correlations between cdgt cd and predicted cd speciation are illustrated in fig 5 in november most data are distributed above the 1 1 line of cdgt cd and free cd2 with a mean ratio of 2 47 fig 5a suggesting that free cd2 could be preferentially taken up by dgt when the presence of other cd inorganic and organic complexes was considered almost all data moved below the 1 1 line with a mean ratio of 0 46 fig 5b illustrating that some inorganic and organic complexes might contribute to cd accumulation on the dgt binding gel this situation appeared more realistic and reasonable because inorganic complexes e g cdno3 cdcl2 aq and cdcl and labile organic complexes could be captured by chelex dgt unsworth et al 2005 as shown in fig 5c and 5d the distribution patterns of data from sites d1 and d2 in july and november are similar interestingly regardless of whether cd inorganic and cd organic complexes were taken into account most data from site x1 fell below the 1 1 line suggesting that the most labile cd species were not bound by chelex gels meanwhile data from site x2 were plotted above the line indicating that the cd species present at that site could be completely captured by dgt these findings were likely associated with the decrease in porewater ph at these two sites in july fig s1 which promoted the desorption of metals from the solid phase and the disassociation of both inorganic and organic complexes as well as possibly s complexes under acidic conditions this finding is supported by elevated concentration ratios 5 82 and 2 57 between cdgt cd and free cd2 mls meanwhile strongly acidic conditions i e ph 5 reduced the binding efficiency of chelex resin for cationic ions resulting in a steeply decreasing trend of cd recovery by chelex dgt in solution zhang and davison 1995 the distinct difference in acid base properties of the porewater between sites x1 ph 5 1 0 5 and x2 ph 5 8 0 4 fig s1 was likely the key driver of their specific distribution patterns another possible explanation for the symbols plotted below the 1 1 line based on the sampling theory of dgt is that cdgt s ii was lower than the concentration of dissolved sulfides in the porewater to various degrees zhang et al 1998 leading to underestimation of the proportion of cd s complexes and thus overestimation of other cd species due to the strong competitive binding ability of sulfides to dissolved cd overall the significantly positive correlation between cdgt cd and predicted free cd2 mls p 0 05 fig 4c and 4d demonstrated a marked increase in cd mobility in july fig 6 3 6 diffusive fluxes and environmental implications of various cd species at the swi to identify the source sink phases of cd between the sediment and water column in different seasons diffusive fluxes of total dissolved cd across the swi were estimated based on eq 3 the migration characteristics of various cd species were also quantified to reveal their potential transformation behavior upon a change in environmental media as depicted in fig 5 negative diffusive flux indicates downward migration of cd from the overlying water to the sediment whereas positive values represent the release of cd from the sediment the total diffusive fluxes of cd were 0 06 µg m 2 d 1 at x1 0 19 µg m 2 d 1 at d1 and 0 27 µg m 2 d 1 at d2 in november generally indicating a sink role of the sediment for cd with the exception of site x2 0 17 µg m 2 d 1 fig 5a in july the sediment s role shifted to a source of cd to the water column with upward fluxes of 0 02 0 39 µg m 2 d 1 fig 5b the seasonal conversion of cd between source and sink phases at the swi could be explained by the following factors first the danshui river and lower reaches of the xizhi river have been subjected to continuous contamination with trace metals wang et al 2015 and weaker reductive conditions in november fig 2 and s1 likely favored the formation of fe mn oxides in surface sediments thereby sequestering cd that diffuses near the swi chen et al 2021 in this case cd contamination of the overlying water induces downward diffusive fluxes second dilution effects of precipitation on the river and cd remobilization associated with sulfide oxidation in sediments in july fig 3 and 4 supported upward concentration gradients leading to the release of sediment cd notably the highest efflux of cd observed at site x1 near the outlet of the xizhi river might cause a secondary contamination risk for water source areas in summer as far as we know this is the first report to quantitatively describe the migration characteristics of a metal with multiple chemical forms at the swi in november mean fluxes were 0 09 µg m 2 d 1 for free cd2 0 01 µg m 2 d 1 for cd s complexes 0 03 µg m 2 d 1 for other cd inorganic complexes and 0 01 µg m 2 d 1 for cd fa complexes and the migration of cd ha complexes was negligible cd in the overlying water diffused primarily into sediments as free ions and inorganic complexes whereas cd was present mainly as sulfides and fa complexes which were released back into the river water especially at sites x2 and d1 fig 5a this phenomenon was related to the change in cd speciation near the swi caused by marked differences between the overlying water and sediment media when downward diffusing free cd2 or cd inorganic complexes excluding sulfide complexes migrated through the swi they readily bound to sulfides and organic complexes once a sufficiently strong concentration gradient formed near the swi dissolved cd in surface sediments could diffuse toward the water column in the form of cd s and cd organic complexes despite their low bioavailability and or mobility in july sediment cd was released mainly as free ions sulfide complexes and other inorganic complexes with mean fluxes of 0 01 0 11 and 0 01 µg m 2 d 1 respectively and fluxes of cd organic complexes were extremely low fig 5b in this scenario released free cd2 and inorganic species were prone to re adsorption onto suspended particulate matter or binding to fe mn oxides in oxic river water fig s1 followed by re deposition in the sediment gao et al 2017 turner et al 2008 zheng et al 2013 in contrast cd s complexes mainly in the forms of cd hs 2 aq and cdhs that diffused into the overlying water had high migration potentials as cd bound to sulfide complexes becomes active after the sulfides undergo complete oxidation under aerobic conditions chen et al 2021 before that transition cd s complexes could remain in the dissolved form and continually migrate to lower reaches of the river driven by the hydraulic gradient 4 conclusion this study integrated chemical sequential extraction procedures in situ passive sampling techniques dgt and hr peeper and a thermodynamic chemical equilibrium model to investigate the seasonal variations of cd mobility in sediments of the xizhi river basin sediments with greater ctotal cd and proportions of nominally active fractions f1 f2 and f3 at sites d1 and d2 exhibited lower cd lability than sediments at sites x1 and x2 where higher cdgt cd and cdissolved cd were measured in both sampling campaigns degradation of organic matter was identified as a potential factor leading to the localized release of sediment cd in contrast to other reports reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides likely contributed little to the release of sediment cd in the present study instead sulfide oxidation was identified as the main cause of differences in cd mobility between seasons and among sampling sites evaluation of metal mobility based on chemical extraction might be inaccurate in the dynamic sediment environment according to the results of cd speciation prediction in the porewater cd s complexes were the dominant form present during both sampling campaigns and these complexes were likely nonlabile for chelex dgt devices under neutral conditions free cd2 cd organic complexes and other cd inorganic complexes were the major components preferentially taken up by dgt in winter meanwhile a drop in ph induced by sulfide oxidation facilitated a marked release of sediment cd and the uptake of porewater cd possibly including cd s complex species by dgt in summer a strongly acidic environment e g ph 5 1 0 5 at site x1 in july might reduce the binding efficiency of dgt resulting in underestimation of cd mobility in sediment generally sediments in the study area acted as a sink of cd to the water column in winter and this role shifted to a source of cd in summer moreover sediment cd was released mainly in cd s complexes which exhibit greater migration potentials than free cd2 and other inorganic species especially near the outlet of the xizhi river thus the xizhi river basin has likely suffered from a long term risk of secondary contamination due to periodic release of sediment cd importantly the environmental safety of the lower reaches which are water source areas in

16479,methane ch4 emissions from freshwater aquatic systems such as rivers and reservoirs are an important component of the global methane budget however the estimation can be largely affected by the spatial and temporal resolutions of measurements especially the lack of high resolution studies in the three gorges reservoir tgr one of the largest reservoirs in the world has led to a longstanding debate on its ch4 emissions in this study the spatial distribution and seasonal variations of dissolved ch4 concentrations were measured using a fast response automated gas equilibrator in the tgr we observed large spatiotemporal variations of dissolved ch4 mean sd 0 26 0 19 μm in summer and 0 24 0 17 μm in winter higher concentrations with stronger variations were found in the upstream than in the section close to the three gorges dam the dissolved ch4 concentration in the tgr was mainly influenced by sewage discharge sedimentation topographical conditions tributaries and spatial and seasonal variations in hydrodynamics regression analyses suggest that the concentration can be characterized by sewage discharge water depth and electrical conductivity to a certain extent mean diffusive ch4 fluxes from the tgr in summer and winter were 16 2 mg m 2 d 1 and 3 1 mg m 2 d 1 respectively downsampling simulations show that scaling dissolved ch4 in the tgr from one site likely involves large errors and at least 38 sites and 52 58 sites are needed to achieve an accurate estimate in summer and winter respectively due to the large spatial and temporal heterogeneity high resolution measurements are key to improving the reliability of ch4 estimates and assessing the contribution of the tgr to regional and global ch4 budgets graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas dissolved ch4 concentration diffusive ch4 flux three gorges reservoir spatial and temporal variability 1 introduction as an important component of inland waters reservoirs are globally significant sites of carbon processing transport and burial and a source of atmospheric greenhouse gasses ghgs such as methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 deemer et al 2016 guérin et al 2006 tranvik et al 2009 the disruption of the river continuum by dams results in the deposition of organic matter in reservoirs and releases ch4 and co2 to the atmosphere a recent global synthesis suggests that reservoirs emit 18 tg ch4 yr 1 95 confidence interval 12 30 tg ch4 yr 1 deemer et al 2016 saunois et al 2020 with the uncertainties partially owing to the strong spatial and temporal variations of emissions even for the same reservoir ch4 emission and concentrations can substantially vary in different parts due primarily to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of various properties that influence the underlying biogeochemical processes for example spatially varying sediment grain size distribution organic matter content sediment porosity and methanogen communities can collectively lead to variations in ch4 production and oxidation berberich et al 2020 liu et al 2018 praetzel et al 2020 other external factors such as agricultural activities e g fertilization urbanization and sewage discharges can substantially alter carbon and nitrogen inputs from terrestrial systems affecting ch4 production and consumption processes wang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 these variations are often poorly resolved by sparse discrete measurements reducing the uncertainties in the estimated ch4 emissions from reservoirs therefore calls for high resolution field measurements that better resolve spatial and temporal ch4 dynamics in the past decade an increasing number of methods have been developed to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of ch4 concentration and flux measurements in aquatic systems for example maeck et al 2013 used an echosounder system to detect ch4 bubbles in river impoundments and reservoirs and revealed that the reservoir sections are the major source of methane emissions gonzalez valencia et al 2014 measured dissolved gas concentrations in lakes using an off axis integrated cavity output spectrometer paranaíba et al 2018 used an equilibration system combined with an ultraportable greenhouse gas analyzer to perform continuous measurements of ch4 and co2 partial pressure recently xiao et al 2020 proposed a method for real time in situ measurements of dissolved ch4 and co2 concentrations in the surface water and in the water column based on a fast response automated gas equilibrator these high resolution efforts have facilitated an improved understanding of different pathways sources and sinks of ghgs in reservoirs and their significance for global carbon budgets meanwhile the proposed methods also enable large scale high resolution ghg measurements with improved accuracy nevertheless there is still a lack of high resolution investigations in large reservoirs especially those with complex topography the three gorges reservoir tgr one of the largest reservoirs in the world has attracted wide attention because of the relatively high ch4 emission from its drawdown area chen et al 2009 water level fluctuations due to seasonal and daily discharge regulations cause substantial variations in ch4 emissions pacheco et al 2015 further resulting in uncertainties in carbon emission estimates for example ch4 fluxes in the drawdown area of the tgr in 2009 160 8 319 2 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 mean sd strongly differed from those observed in 2010 5 8 8 9 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 chen et al 2009 2011 similar high temporal and spatial heterogeneity has also been observed in the mainstream and tributaries lei et al 2019 xiao et al 2013a yang et al 2013a 2013b for dissolved ch4 concentrations in the tgr existing studies are mainly based on point scale surveys xiao et al 2013b yang et al 2013a while continuous high resolution measurements are hitherto absent apparently due to the high spatiotemporal variability an accurate estimation of ch4 emissions in large reservoirs is unlikely to be achieved by sampling at a few sites to better constrain the magnitude as well as the spatial and temporal dynamics of ch4 in tgr we conducted high resolution mapping campaigns of dissolved ch4 over the entire tgr in summer and winter seasons and estimated the diffusive ch4 flux in addition by leveraging the high resolution measurements we carried out downsampling simulations to evaluate the minimum sampling effort that is required to achieve accurate concentration estimates in different seasons 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and sampling overview the tgr is a valley type reservoir in the yangtze river in china with a total surface area of 1084 km2 at a normal water level of 175 m above sea level 782 km2 for the mainstream and 302 km2 for tributaries at this water level midstream water depth increases along the reservoir from 54 m in chongqing cq to 130 m in zigui zg figs 1 and s1 the tgr is about 660 km long with many counties and dozens of tributaries on both sides fig 1 and table s1 more than 95 of the area within the tgr basin is mountainous of which 49 is covered by forests the tgr region is subject to subtropical monsoon climate and the annual average temperature precipitation and wind speed are 17 9 c 1115 mm and 1 3 m s 1 respectively the tgr region has summers from june to august and winters from november to february which correspond to low water level flood retention and high water level maximum hydropower capacity of the reservoir respectively the reservoir water level gradually drops from 175 m to 145 m prior to the flood season and rises again to 175 m in september and october this regular seasonal operation results in two distinct states of the tgr river state in summer and lake state in winter note that the water level mentioned in this study refers to the level recorded at the three gorges dam tgd four sampling campaigns were conducted in the tgr in 2018 2020 during both river and lake states covering a length of 645 km 98 of its total length fig 1 during the first campaign in summer aug 8th aug 11th 2018 and the second campaign in winter nov 28th dec 1st 2018 we measured dissolved ch4 concentrations in the surface water along the reservoir from zg the location of the tgd to cq in both daytime and nighttime with a cruise ship which sailed upstream along the north bank at a speed of 20 km h 1 during the first campaign we measured ch4 concentrations at 156 sites with bucket collection fig 1 3 5 km between sampling sites whereas during the second campaign we used continuous high resolution shipboard sampling the third and fourth high resolution campaigns dec 15th 2019 jan 1st 2020 and jan 3rd 8th 2020 respectively were conducted only during daytime in winter with a cruising speed of 12 to 15 km h 1 in the third campaign the ship sailed upstream from zg to cq along the north bank while in the last one the ship sailed downstream from cq to guojiaba gjb 30 km from the dam along the south bank all four campaigns were carried out in the main channel of the tgr away from the riverbank to avoid potential disturbance and all in sunny weather except the last day of the fourth campaign rainy based on the measured ch4 concentrations see section 3 the reservoir can be generally divided into three sections the upper section is the backwater area during both summer and winter from the cq wharf to 480 km upstream of the tgd the middle section is from 480 km to 160 km upstream of the tgd the lower section is from 160 km upstream of the tgd to the dam the area of the water surface in each section is approximately proportional to the section length 2 2 dissolved ch4 concentration measurements and diffusive ch4 flux estimation dissolved ch4 concentrations in the surface water were mapped using continuous shipboard measurements with a fast response automated gas equilibrator farage xiao et al 2020 coupled to a greenhouse gas analyzer g2301 g2201i picarro usa water samples were pumped continuously from a depth of about 0 5 m by a self priming pump part of the sampled water was pumped into the farage by a peristaltic pump 250 ml min 1 we also measured the vertical profiles of dissolved ch4 concentrations at major cities in the third campaign when the ship stopped at ports during which we used a submersible pump slightly different from the method described in xiao et al 2020 in which a compressed air tank was used for gas supply we used a large 2000 l gas bag dunnage bag to store the carrier gas and a gas pump to generate a constant gas flow 900 ml min 1 the gas bag was refilled frequently from another bag containing n2 gas to ensure that the ch4 mixing ratio is between 0 8 and 1 2 ppm by volume we recorded the actual ch4 content prior to each measurement for the headspace equilibrium calculation the headspace gas from the gas water mixing unit see details in xiao et al 2020 was fed into the greenhouse gas analyzer which then measured the mole fraction of ch4 the equilibrator was calibrated following xiao et al 2020 and the dissolved concentration was calculated using the calibration curve and in situ water temperature during the first campaign dissolved ch4 concentrations were averaged over a measurement period of 3 min at each sampling site temporal resolution 12 min the spatial resolutions of dissolved ch4 concentration measurements during the later three campaigns were further improved via a boat based in situ sampling technique the spatial resolution of the second campaign was 1000 m slightly lower than that of the last two campaigns 600 m and 750 m respectively temporal resolution 3 min diffusive ch4 flux was estimated based on the dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water according to the thin boundary layer model 1 f c h 4 k c w c e q where f ch4 is the diffusive ch4 flux c w is the dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water and c eq is the dissolved ch4 concentration that is in equilibrium with the overlying air the gas transfer velocity k is calculated as 2 k k 600 s c 600 0 5 where k 600 is the gas transfer velocity cm h 1 normalized to a schmidt number of 600 which is 5 3 31 7 cm h 1 14 6 8 9 cm h 1 for the river state and 2 0 5 9 cm h 1 3 4 0 1 cm h 1 for the lake state in the mainstream of the tgr following li 2018 the exponent 0 5 is used considering the water area and turbulence in the tgr li 2018 the schmidt number for ch4 sc is calculated as wanninkhof 1992 3 s c 1897 8 114 28 t 3

discharge data inflow and outflow during all campaigns were retrieved from the china three gorges corporation fig s2 we derived midstream water depths by subtracting the riverbed elevation li et al 2020a from the surface water level population data were obtained from the sixth national population census of china fig 1 and table s1 data for the processed sewage discharge were retrieved from a database of urban sewage treatment facilities in operation in china for the year 2014 table s1 physico chemical properties of the surface water water temperature dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity were measured at sections close to major cities towns and confluences of tributaries in the first and third campaigns during the other two campaigns measurements were conducted simultaneously with dissolved gas concentration sampling fig s3 note that measurements in two campaigns in 2018 were based on a multi parameter probe ds5 hach usa while in the third and fourth campaigns we used a ysi multi parameter probe exo2 ysi usa the geographic locations of all measurements were determined based on the gps coordinates of the boat 2 4 sampling effort evaluation of dissolved ch4 concentrations although high resolution measurements are critical to reliably capturing the magnitude and spatial patterns of ghg fluxes and concentrations in reservoirs these sampling campaigns are time consuming and expensive especially in large reservoirs e g the tgr therefore we conducted downsampling simulations paranaíba et al 2018 wik et al 2016 to determine the minimum number of sampling sites per kilometer required to obtain a high accuracy representative mean dissolved ch4 concentration of the tgr the assumption of these simulations is that our high resolution sampling campaigns can sufficiently capture the spatial variations of surface water ch4 concentrations for the entire reservoir compared to the mean concentrations from our campaigns the result of the minimum sampling effort should have a relative error within 20 with high confidence 95 probability paranaíba et al 2018 wik et al 2016 the four campaigns have 156 32274 36052 and 32424 sampling sites points n respectively in the hypothetical downsampling scenarios we created n bins for each campaign with i th bin consisting of 100 combinations of i measurements randomly drawn from the entire observational dataset without replacement for each combination for example the first bin has 100 combinations of one data point viz 100 data points representing 100 possible experiments that each has one randomly selected sampling site while the second bin has 100 combinations of two data points representing 100 possible experiments that each has two sampling sites the number of data points in each combination represents the number of sampling sites for the entire sampled section 645 km based upon the simulations we estimated the chance of reaching high accuracy concentration estimate and the risks of overestimates and underestimates 3 results 3 1 hydrologic conditions and limnological variables the mean discharge from the tgd during the summer campaign 29032 120 m3 s 1 was approximately threefold higher than during winter campaigns 6228 149 m3 s 1 6782 1031 m3 s 1 and 7797 1625 m3 s 1 in november december and january respectively during the summer campaign in 2018 the water level at the tgd 155 3 0 5 m decreased continuously by about 2 m from 156 m to 154 m but was still relatively higher than the normal low water level 145 m due to a recent flood fig s2 compared to that during the summer campaign the water level during winter was higher and more stable the water levels were 174 4 0 1 m and 174 3 0 1 m in november and december respectively and slightly decreased from 173 8 to 172 7 m during the january campaign fig s2 note that these three winter campaigns cover not only different months after the end of the flood season but also variations in water level along with the summer campaign they provide unique opportunities to examine dissolved ch4 concentrations under different hydrologic conditions and sediment deposition conditions dissolved oxygen concentrations were similar during all four campaigns with minor variations the ranges of dissolved oxygen concentrations were 7 5 8 5 mg l 1 8 3 9 3 mg l 1 7 1 8 4 mg l 1 and 7 3 8 2 mg l 1 in four campaigns fig s3 as suggested by the profile measurements at 12 sites in the third campaign dissolved oxygen in the water column was well oxygenated fig s4 dissolved oxygen in general gradually decreased from upstream to downstream in all four campaigns although with a rapid increase from fengjie fj to zg in the first campaign water temperatures during the winter campaigns gradually increased from upstream to downstream along the reservoir fig s3 in contrast fluctuating water temperatures were observed in summer especially between zhongxian zx and zg as the air temperature drops water temperatures in the fourth campaign 14 5 0 4 c were slightly lower than in the third one 15 8 1 4 c note that we did not observe clear thermal stratifications in the third campaign the water temperature difference between the surface and bottom layers was less than 1 c at all profile sites fig s4 the summer campaign had much lower electrical conductivity 338 5 7 8 µs cm 1 than winter ones 374 5 14 1 µs cm 1 425 1 16 7 µs cm 1 and 411 3 11 9 µs cm 1 in the second third and fourth campaigns respectively fig s3 similar to the longitudinal changes of dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity in general decreased from upstream to downstream in all four campaigns with a continuous rise near the tgd only in the summer campaign most of the measured physico chemical parameters had relatively smoother trends along the reservoir during winter campaigns than during the summer one 3 2 dissolved ch4 concentrations and diffusive ch4 fluxes the spatial distributions of the measured dissolved ch4 concentrations are shown in figs 2 and 3 clear spatial variations were observed dissolved ch4 concentrations are generally greater in the upstream than in the downstream with a rapid change near the middle section of the tgr hereafter gradient region the longitudinal distributions were relatively consistent in all four campaigns despite the differences in water level temperatures and other conditions meanwhile the observed concentrations in different campaigns were on average quite similar although with seasonal variations 0 26 0 19 μm 0 33 0 27 μm 0 22 0 16 μm and 0 26 0 18 μm in the first second third and fourth campaigns respectively the surface water was supersaturated with ch4 with dissolved concentrations being 93 103 65 and 75 times the corresponding atmospheric equilibrium concentrations in four campaigns table s2 summarizes the measured ch4 concentrations in the upper middle and lower sections of the tgr see section 2 1 in summer the dissolved ch4 gradually decreased from the upper section to the lower section although with several sudden drops between cq and wanzhou wz the maximum ch4 concentrations were observed in the upper section close to cq in comparison ch4 concentrations first increased from the upper section to the middle section then decreased further downstream in winter see also figs 2 and 3 the maximum concentrations mainly occurred between fuling fl and zx the mean concentrations and their spatial and seasonal variations in the lower section were much lower than those in the upper and middle sections in both seasons table s2 it is noteworthy that seasonally dependent peaks and drops in ch4 concentrations were found near the confluences of tributaries corresponding to the location of major cities and counties local peaks of dissolved ch4 in the river channel occurred in several counties during winter campaigns which turned to sudden drops in summer due primarily to the seasonal tributary inflows examples are fl fengdu fd zx and wz see fig 3 a gradient region with rapid changes in ch4 concentrations decreasing from upstream to downstream was observed in all campaigns in which concentration changes along the reservoir were nearly linear figs 2 and 3 the gradient region in the summer campaign spanned across the entire middle section and even extended into the upper section in comparison the gradient regions in winter campaigns were much smaller and were generally located between zx and yunyang yy with relatively fewer longitudinal fluctuations the length of the gradient region in summer 320 km was approximately two times greater than its winter counterpart we then evaluated the rate of concentration decrease μm km 1 with a simple linear regression model the slopes of regression models are shown in fig 3 the decreasing rates in winter campaigns were much greater than in the summer one and the largest decreasing rate was observed in the third campaign 0 005 μm km 1 the estimation of diffusive ch4 flux further suggests that the tgr on average is a net source of atmospheric ch4 table s2 the diffusive ch4 flux in the summer campaign was 16 2 21 8 mg m 2 d 1 much greater than those in winter 3 9 3 3 mg m 2 d 1 2 5 1 9 mg m 2 d 1 and 2 9 2 0 mg m 2 d 1 in november december and january respectively in comparison to the dissolved ch4 concentration the diffusive flux exhibited a more pronounced seasonal variability with the mean flux in summer being 3 5 times higher than in winter meanwhile the upper and middle sections of the tgr were hot spots of diffusive ch4 emissions in both seasons especially the mean diffusive flux in the upper section was 5 7 times that of the lower section table s2 3 3 determinants of dissolved ch4 concentrations in both seasons dissolved ch4 concentrations observed near major counties were positively related to sewage discharges p 0 05 based on a two tailed t test but negatively related to midstream water depth p 0 05 fig 4 a and b note that we did not include cq the largest city in the tgr region in the regression analysis for sewage discharge considering the strong influence of its extremely high discharge fd and zx were also excluded from fig 4a due to the contributions of disproportionately high stoichiometric reservoir sedimentation to ch4 accumulation in the middle section li et al 2020a sewage discharge and water depth explained up to 91 and 73 of the observed variance in ch4 concentrations respectively with higher coefficients of determination r2 in summer than in winter the relationships between ch4 concentrations and electrical conductivity were analyzed for the second and fourth high resolution winter campaigns during which we sailed upstream and downstream respectively as shown in fig 4c and d the slope of the linear regression between the dissolved ch4 and electrical conductivity was positive for low concentrations but became negative for ch4 concentrations above a certain threshold turning point the turning points were 0 56 μμ for the second campaign and 0 40 μμ for the fourth one concentrations around the turning point were observed at locations close to zx in both campaigns figs 3 and s3 in addition the linear relationships were relatively weaker for concentrations higher than the turning points as suggested by the lower r2 from the regression models below the turning points the slopes of the linear regression models between concentration and electrical conductivity were nearly identical in both campaigns fig 4c and d r2 0 5 this suggests that electrical conductivity was a good predictor of dissolved ch4 concentrations downstream of zx in winter 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variability of dissolved ch4 concentrations our high resolution longitudinal surveys over a 645 km distance revealed large spatial variability of ch4 concentrations in the surface water of the tgr figs 2 and 3 this heterogeneity reflects the collective influence of topographical conditions the confluence of tributaries sewage discharges from major counties along the river and environmental and limnological variables we found that dissolved ch4 concentrations were relatively lower in the lower section than in the upper and middle sections of the reservoir fig 3 several hot spots peaks of dissolved ch4 concentrations observed in the upper and middle sections in all four campaigns are likely due to sewage discharges from nearby cities and counties see fig 4a this is consistent with a previous study li et al 2020b in which local peaks of co2 and ch4 emissions corresponded well with major cities along the yangtze river in fact wastewater produced by anthropogenic activities in urban areas has been suggested to substantially contribute to ch4 emission yang et al 2020 for example according to the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant from the state environmental protection administration of china in 2003 the wastewater discharges produced by the entire municipality of chongqing alone total wastewater was 587 8 million m3 or 1458 million t in 2014 note that 1 t 1000 kg can lead to approximately 0 59 t of dissolved ch4 discharged to the river and released into the atmosphere it is noteworthy that the urban expansion and population growth in cities downstream of cq along the tgr are largely limited by complex geographical and topographical conditions figs 1 and 2 this lack of human activities between cities further contributes to the observed strong spatial heterogeneity in ch4 concentrations figs 1 and 3 compared to other sections the upstream part of the middle section in general had relatively high ch4 concentrations figs 2 and 3 the high concentrations in this section result not only from wastewater discharges from large cities but also from the increased sediment deposition the longitudinally decreasing flow velocity and increasing water retention time in this section jointly lead to the increased deposition of sediments transported from the upstream especially between fl and zx li et al 2018 considering the nearly well mixed hydrodynamic condition in the mainstream of the tgr zhao et al 2013 anaerobic methane production in the water column was limited fig s4 and the observed ch4 accumulation was most likely fueled by the production in the sediment in addition the linear relationship between electrical conductivity and ch4 in this section was very weak fig 4c and d possibly owing to the disturbance of the additional methane production by sedimentation a gradient region with nearly linearly decreasing ch4 concentrations toward downstream was observed in all campaigns relatively higher ch4 concentrations and electrical conductivity upstream of zx served as a source to diffuse downstream with the flow creating a smooth concentration gradient in this region especially in winter figs 3 and s3 moreover the upstream end of the winter gradient regions was at zx which also corresponds to the turning points of the linear relationship between dissolved ch4 and electrical conductivity fig 4c and d wastewater can be considered as a common source of elevated dissolved ch4 concentration and electrical conductivity therefore the strong linear relationship between dissolved ch4 and electrical conductivity in the section downstream of zx suggests that electrical conductivity as a conservative proxy for material transport can be a potential predictor of the ch4 concentration moreover the linear regressions between ch4 concentration and electrical conductivity below the turning points were nearly identical in both winter campaigns partially because of the regular operation of the tgr the relatively lower and more stable ch4 concentrations in the lower section partly result from the geographical conditions and low level of urbanization figs 1 3 about 96 of the tgr catchment is mountainous with gorges from fj to zg li 2018 where the gorges are dominated by granite and limestone rocks and shallow nutrient poor and acidic soils which cannot support rapid vegetation growth hu and cheng 2013 in addition most settlements in this section are small villages and towns as a result the organic matter input in this section is much lower than upstream ones moreover the backwater area from cq to fl and highly curved channels near zx with decreased flow velocity facilitate sediment deposition in upstream sections further decreases sediments and the associated ch4 production in this section the significant negative correlations between water depth and ch4 concentration in both seasons indicate that water depth is another determinant the oxygen enriched water column in the tgr as an inevitable pathway from sediment to surface water for ch4 emission influences the concentration of dissolved ch4 in the surface water via oxidation lei et al 2019 wang et al 2014 which explains the lower ch4 concentrations in this section with large water depth near the tgd fig s1 4 2 temporal variability of dissolved ch4 concentrations the tgr changes from river state in summer to lake state in winter while the water level increases from 145 m to 175 m due to reservoir operation li 2018 this reservoir operation substantially alters the water retention time less than 20 days in summer vs approximately 80 days in winter such strong fluctuations of water level have been suggested to significantly affect the biogeochemical processes e g dynamics of nutrients in the tgr the interactions between the mainstream and tributaries and therefore the spatial distribution of dissolved ch4 long et al 2020 yang et al 2018 for example yang et al 2018 found that nutrient concentrations in the tributaries of the tgr were irregular due to the exchange between tributary flow and mainstream intrusion in the rainy season it is reasonable to believe that dissolved ch4 concentrations in the mainstream of the tgr can also be affected by the inflow from tributaries during different seasons the summer campaign was conducted after a flood event in summer floods in the mainstream of the tgr often carry higher levels of dissolved ch4 discharged from major cities see section 4 1 compared to those from mountainous areas tributaries therefore the dissolved ch4 in the mainstream can be diluted by the tributary inflows this dilution effect has been reported for nutrient concentration in the tgr in previous studies huang et al 2014 yang et al 2018 and apparently also contributed to the observed sudden drops in dissolved ch4 concentrations at confluences of tributaries figs 2 and 3 during the winter campaigns the very low water discharge and the possible presence of intrusive density currents from the mainstream in the bottom layer of tributaries yang et al 2018 largely limited the transport of dissolved ch4 from tributaries which explains the absence of sudden drops instead we observed more pronounced local peaks in ch4 concentrations at some confluences of tributaries near several major cities and industrial areas likely due to the discharge of untreated wastewater fig 3 and table s1 this highlights the important role that tributaries play in the seasonal variations of ch4 concentrations in the tgr seasonal differences were also observed in the spatial distribution of dissolved ch4 the gradient region in summer was more unsteady and had a relatively lower gradient of dissolved ch4 concentration than in winter fig 3 during the flood season in summer most of the tgr s organic carbon inputs are from sediments and sewage water discharge from upstream the hydrodynamic conditions with high flow velocity and low water level river state formed by the flood discharge promote the high dissolved ch4 from the upstream to decrease downstream along the reservoir liu et al 2012 sha et al 2015 resulting in a long gradient region in comparison the lake state in winter results in much slower material transport along the reservoir and the production and persistence of ch4 exhibit clear local scale characteristics see sections 3 2 and 4 1 therefore the gradient region is much shorter than in summer with a relatively higher decreasing rate we also observed differences in the gradient region among the three winter campaigns the second campaign in 2018 was conducted about one month after the water level of the tgd reached 175 m normal water level and the transition from river state to lake state led to a decreasing rate stronger than the summer one but weaker than those in the last two campaigns compared to the third campaign the fourth campaign experienced increased outflow fig s2c and flow velocity in the downstream sections this hydrodynamic changes within a short period decreased the rate of concentration change in the gradient region fig 3 meanwhile the upstream and downstream ends of the gradient region shifted toward fd and the tgd respectively the change from the third to fourth campaigns is also consistent with the lower decreasing rate and longer gradient region observed in summer highlighting that the changing hydrodynamics due to reservoir operation is indeed a critical factor driving the longitudinal distribution of dissolved ch4 in the tgr 4 3 comparisons with previous studies in the tgr and other reservoirs the dissolved ch4 concentrations and diffusive ch4 fluxes observed in all campaigns confirm that the tgr is a net source of atmospheric ch4 which is generally consistent with previous studies table 1 the estimated mean diffusive ch4 emissions here are of the same order of magnitude as most existing flux measurements in the mainstream and tributaries of the tgr but slightly higher than some point based measurements at sites close to the tgd compared to winter higher temperature and more organic carbon input are conducive to higher ch4 production and emissions in summer grinham et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2015 as a result the ch4 flux observed in summer was about 4 2 times higher than in winter this is in agreement with yang et al 2013a in which the ratios of summer to winter fluxes at yy ws and zg were 7 2 3 4 and 1 7 respectively it is noteworthy that the section from cq to fl where we observed ch4 emission hot spots has been rarely studied previously the insufficient study in this reservoir section might introduce large uncertainties when estimating the ch4 emission from the entire tgr in addition the observed mean diffusive ch4 flux in our study 9 65 mg m 2 d 1 the weighted average of four campaigns was greater than that of pre impoundment and initial impoundment conditions but close to the level observed seven years after the trial impoundment in 2008 li et al 2020b 2020c this suggests that the diffusive ch4 flux in the tgr might have stabilized as influenced by the oxygenated water column the reduction in nutrient loading and dam operations deemer et al 2016 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 we further compare our observations with studies in other reservoirs table 2 the ch4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes in the tgr are in the range of observations in many subtropical and temperate reservoirs such as a costal reservoir affected by sewage yang et al 2020 and the cascading reservoirs in the upper mekong river and saar river liu et al 2020 maeck et al 2013 the differences in ch4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes between the upper and lower sections of the tgr table s2 are also in agreement with observations in several small reservoirs by wang et al 2017 in which the authors found that reservoirs affected by urban areas had relatively higher emissions and concentrations than those within natural landscapes e g forests however the tgr has much lower ch4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes than some tropical reservoirs in brazil where high resolution measurements have been conducted paranaíba et al 2018 note that here we only compare the diffusive flux while in many reservoirs listed in table 2 bubbling was an important pathway of the ch4 emission liu et al 2020 maeck et al 2013 especially frequent ebullition is common in many temperate sub tropical and tropical reservoirs where the water depth is less than 40 m delsontro et al 2011 grinham et al 2018 tušer et al 2017 in contrast bubbling is relatively rare and unimportant in the mainstream of the tgr which is mainly because of the large water depth and resulting high hydrostatic pressure in the mainstream sediments negligible ebullition fluxes from the tgr mainstream are also supported by our previous investigations at gjb in the mainstream using an echo sounder simrad ey60 norway in which no clear bubbles were detected unpublished data therefore the total ch4 emission from the mainstream of the tgr might be much lower than from shallower reservoirs with substantial ebullitive emissions 4 4 downsampling simulations of different sampling sites and minimum sampling effort the results of the downsampling simulations based on measurements from all four campaigns are shown in fig 5 as expected as the number of sampling sites per kilometer increases the chance of high accuracy mean concentration estimates also increases highlighting the importance of high resolution measurements to obtain a representative mean dissolved ch4 concentration of the tgr relative error within 20 with high confidence see section 2 4 the minimum numbers of sampling sites in summer and winter are 0 06 per kilometer and 0 08 0 09 per kilometer or equivalently one site every 17 4 km and one site every 11 3 12 6 km respectively the minimum numbers of sites required in winter campaigns are slightly higher than in summer due to the greater variations in dissolved ch4 e g local peaks see section 3 2 fig 5b c and d the risks of overestimates and underestimates with the minimum sampling effort are nearly identical 2 5 we further estimated the chance of achieving high accuracy with a relative error within 20 dissolved ch4 concentration estimates with a single sampling site in the entire tgr the probabilities for four campaigns under the single site scenario are 12 11 12 and 14 the lowest orange circles in fig 5 in other words the probabilities of underestimates overestimates are 88 87 88 or 86 it is clear that although the numbers of sampling sites differed among the four campaigns the minimum sampling effort and probabilities of errors are consistent the estimation of minimum sampling effort is informative for the design of future field measurements in large reservoirs such as the tgr according to the downsampling simulations the minimum sampling effort is one site every 17 4 km in summer or equivalently 38 sites for the entire 660 km tgr compared to summer measurements winter campaigns need more sites to capture the strong variations in ch4 concentrations e g local peaks figs 2 and 3 the minimum sampling effort in winter is one site every 11 3 12 6 km or equivalently 52 58 sites for the entire tgr meanwhile the probability of achieving high accuracy concentration measurements in the tgr with only one site is less than 14 our investigation partly explains the inconsistent results of previous carbon emission surveys in the tgr in which the sampling sites were insufficient and usually located in the confluences of tributaries and counties e g xiao et al 2013b yang et al 2013a in addition our results suggest that scaling concentrations and emissions for the entire tgr from a single or from few sampling sites i e less than 38 58 depending on the season is unlikely to yield a high accuracy result consistent with a previous study in tropical reservoirs paranaíba et al 2018 5 conclusions we conducted four high resolution mapping campaigns of dissolved ch4 concentrations using a fast response automated gas equilibrator in different seasons and estimated diffusive ch4 fluxes in the tgr the spatial and temporal variability of ch4 concentrations in the tgr was strong with relatively higher local scale effects concentration peaks in winter than in summer dissolved ch4 in the tgr was always supersaturated during all sampling campaigns suggesting that the tgr is the source of atmospheric ch4 in both seasons the spatial variation in dissolved ch4 concentrations was mainly determined by sewage discharge from cities and counties sedimentation and topographical conditions the temporal variation mainly resulted from seasonal reservoir operation and changes in tributary flows the associated diffusive ch4 fluxes were 16 2 mg m 2 d 1 and 3 1 mg m 2 d 1 in summer and winter respectively downsampling simulations show that at least 38 sites and 52 58 sites are needed to capture the dissolved ch4 concentration of the entire tgr in summer and winter respectively while results scaled from one or a few sampling sites are unlikely to represent the entire reservoir this highlights that high resolution mapping campaigns are critical to depicting longitudinal variations of ghg concentrations and emissions and reducing uncertainties in large reservoirs such as the tgr it is noteworthy that our sampling campaigns were in the most representative seasons summer and winter whereas the conditions in other seasons especially during the transition period between river state and lake state of the tgr with strong water level fluctuations remain unexplored in addition as the first step we only investigated ch4 concentrations and estimated diffusive fluxes while the high resolution mapping of co2 emissions and other ghgs is also imperative to reveal the spatial and temporal variability nevertheless as the first high resolution ch4 concentration measurements in this region this study reveals the spatial and temporal dynamics of dissolved ch4 concentrations and their potential determinants our findings shed light on the field campaigns in not only the tgr but also other similar large reservoirs in the world highlighting the need for high resolution measurements to accurately estimate ghg concentrations and emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests acknowledgements this work

16479,methane ch4 emissions from freshwater aquatic systems such as rivers and reservoirs are an important component of the global methane budget however the estimation can be largely affected by the spatial and temporal resolutions of measurements especially the lack of high resolution studies in the three gorges reservoir tgr one of the largest reservoirs in the world has led to a longstanding debate on its ch4 emissions in this study the spatial distribution and seasonal variations of dissolved ch4 concentrations were measured using a fast response automated gas equilibrator in the tgr we observed large spatiotemporal variations of dissolved ch4 mean sd 0 26 0 19 μm in summer and 0 24 0 17 μm in winter higher concentrations with stronger variations were found in the upstream than in the section close to the three gorges dam the dissolved ch4 concentration in the tgr was mainly influenced by sewage discharge sedimentation topographical conditions tributaries and spatial and seasonal variations in hydrodynamics regression analyses suggest that the concentration can be characterized by sewage discharge water depth and electrical conductivity to a certain extent mean diffusive ch4 fluxes from the tgr in summer and winter were 16 2 mg m 2 d 1 and 3 1 mg m 2 d 1 respectively downsampling simulations show that scaling dissolved ch4 in the tgr from one site likely involves large errors and at least 38 sites and 52 58 sites are needed to achieve an accurate estimate in summer and winter respectively due to the large spatial and temporal heterogeneity high resolution measurements are key to improving the reliability of ch4 estimates and assessing the contribution of the tgr to regional and global ch4 budgets graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas dissolved ch4 concentration diffusive ch4 flux three gorges reservoir spatial and temporal variability 1 introduction as an important component of inland waters reservoirs are globally significant sites of carbon processing transport and burial and a source of atmospheric greenhouse gasses ghgs such as methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 deemer et al 2016 guérin et al 2006 tranvik et al 2009 the disruption of the river continuum by dams results in the deposition of organic matter in reservoirs and releases ch4 and co2 to the atmosphere a recent global synthesis suggests that reservoirs emit 18 tg ch4 yr 1 95 confidence interval 12 30 tg ch4 yr 1 deemer et al 2016 saunois et al 2020 with the uncertainties partially owing to the strong spatial and temporal variations of emissions even for the same reservoir ch4 emission and concentrations can substantially vary in different parts due primarily to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of various properties that influence the underlying biogeochemical processes for example spatially varying sediment grain size distribution organic matter content sediment porosity and methanogen communities can collectively lead to variations in ch4 production and oxidation berberich et al 2020 liu et al 2018 praetzel et al 2020 other external factors such as agricultural activities e g fertilization urbanization and sewage discharges can substantially alter carbon and nitrogen inputs from terrestrial systems affecting ch4 production and consumption processes wang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 these variations are often poorly resolved by sparse discrete measurements reducing the uncertainties in the estimated ch4 emissions from reservoirs therefore calls for high resolution field measurements that better resolve spatial and temporal ch4 dynamics in the past decade an increasing number of methods have been developed to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of ch4 concentration and flux measurements in aquatic systems for example maeck et al 2013 used an echosounder system to detect ch4 bubbles in river impoundments and reservoirs and revealed that the reservoir sections are the major source of methane emissions gonzalez valencia et al 2014 measured dissolved gas concentrations in lakes using an off axis integrated cavity output spectrometer paranaíba et al 2018 used an equilibration system combined with an ultraportable greenhouse gas analyzer to perform continuous measurements of ch4 and co2 partial pressure recently xiao et al 2020 proposed a method for real time in situ measurements of dissolved ch4 and co2 concentrations in the surface water and in the water column based on a fast response automated gas equilibrator these high resolution efforts have facilitated an improved understanding of different pathways sources and sinks of ghgs in reservoirs and their significance for global carbon budgets meanwhile the proposed methods also enable large scale high resolution ghg measurements with improved accuracy nevertheless there is still a lack of high resolution investigations in large reservoirs especially those with complex topography the three gorges reservoir tgr one of the largest reservoirs in the world has attracted wide attention because of the relatively high ch4 emission from its drawdown area chen et al 2009 water level fluctuations due to seasonal and daily discharge regulations cause substantial variations in ch4 emissions pacheco et al 2015 further resulting in uncertainties in carbon emission estimates for example ch4 fluxes in the drawdown area of the tgr in 2009 160 8 319 2 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 mean sd strongly differed from those observed in 2010 5 8 8 9 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 chen et al 2009 2011 similar high temporal and spatial heterogeneity has also been observed in the mainstream and tributaries lei et al 2019 xiao et al 2013a yang et al 2013a 2013b for dissolved ch4 concentrations in the tgr existing studies are mainly based on point scale surveys xiao et al 2013b yang et al 2013a while continuous high resolution measurements are hitherto absent apparently due to the high spatiotemporal variability an accurate estimation of ch4 emissions in large reservoirs is unlikely to be achieved by sampling at a few sites to better constrain the magnitude as well as the spatial and temporal dynamics of ch4 in tgr we conducted high resolution mapping campaigns of dissolved ch4 over the entire tgr in summer and winter seasons and estimated the diffusive ch4 flux in addition by leveraging the high resolution measurements we carried out downsampling simulations to evaluate the minimum sampling effort that is required to achieve accurate concentration estimates in different seasons 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and sampling overview the tgr is a valley type reservoir in the yangtze river in china with a total surface area of 1084 km2 at a normal water level of 175 m above sea level 782 km2 for the mainstream and 302 km2 for tributaries at this water level midstream water depth increases along the reservoir from 54 m in chongqing cq to 130 m in zigui zg figs 1 and s1 the tgr is about 660 km long with many counties and dozens of tributaries on both sides fig 1 and table s1 more than 95 of the area within the tgr basin is mountainous of which 49 is covered by forests the tgr region is subject to subtropical monsoon climate and the annual average temperature precipitation and wind speed are 17 9 c 1115 mm and 1 3 m s 1 respectively the tgr region has summers from june to august and winters from november to february which correspond to low water level flood retention and high water level maximum hydropower capacity of the reservoir respectively the reservoir water level gradually drops from 175 m to 145 m prior to the flood season and rises again to 175 m in september and october this regular seasonal operation results in two distinct states of the tgr river state in summer and lake state in winter note that the water level mentioned in this study refers to the level recorded at the three gorges dam tgd four sampling campaigns were conducted in the tgr in 2018 2020 during both river and lake states covering a length of 645 km 98 of its total length fig 1 during the first campaign in summer aug 8th aug 11th 2018 and the second campaign in winter nov 28th dec 1st 2018 we measured dissolved ch4 concentrations in the surface water along the reservoir from zg the location of the tgd to cq in both daytime and nighttime with a cruise ship which sailed upstream along the north bank at a speed of 20 km h 1 during the first campaign we measured ch4 concentrations at 156 sites with bucket collection fig 1 3 5 km between sampling sites whereas during the second campaign we used continuous high resolution shipboard sampling the third and fourth high resolution campaigns dec 15th 2019 jan 1st 2020 and jan 3rd 8th 2020 respectively were conducted only during daytime in winter with a cruising speed of 12 to 15 km h 1 in the third campaign the ship sailed upstream from zg to cq along the north bank while in the last one the ship sailed downstream from cq to guojiaba gjb 30 km from the dam along the south bank all four campaigns were carried out in the main channel of the tgr away from the riverbank to avoid potential disturbance and all in sunny weather except the last day of the fourth campaign rainy based on the measured ch4 concentrations see section 3 the reservoir can be generally divided into three sections the upper section is the backwater area during both summer and winter from the cq wharf to 480 km upstream of the tgd the middle section is from 480 km to 160 km upstream of the tgd the lower section is from 160 km upstream of the tgd to the dam the area of the water surface in each section is approximately proportional to the section length 2 2 dissolved ch4 concentration measurements and diffusive ch4 flux estimation dissolved ch4 concentrations in the surface water were mapped using continuous shipboard measurements with a fast response automated gas equilibrator farage xiao et al 2020 coupled to a greenhouse gas analyzer g2301 g2201i picarro usa water samples were pumped continuously from a depth of about 0 5 m by a self priming pump part of the sampled water was pumped into the farage by a peristaltic pump 250 ml min 1 we also measured the vertical profiles of dissolved ch4 concentrations at major cities in the third campaign when the ship stopped at ports during which we used a submersible pump slightly different from the method described in xiao et al 2020 in which a compressed air tank was used for gas supply we used a large 2000 l gas bag dunnage bag to store the carrier gas and a gas pump to generate a constant gas flow 900 ml min 1 the gas bag was refilled frequently from another bag containing n2 gas to ensure that the ch4 mixing ratio is between 0 8 and 1 2 ppm by volume we recorded the actual ch4 content prior to each measurement for the headspace equilibrium calculation the headspace gas from the gas water mixing unit see details in xiao et al 2020 was fed into the greenhouse gas analyzer which then measured the mole fraction of ch4 the equilibrator was calibrated following xiao et al 2020 and the dissolved concentration was calculated using the calibration curve and in situ water temperature during the first campaign dissolved ch4 concentrations were averaged over a measurement period of 3 min at each sampling site temporal resolution 12 min the spatial resolutions of dissolved ch4 concentration measurements during the later three campaigns were further improved via a boat based in situ sampling technique the spatial resolution of the second campaign was 1000 m slightly lower than that of the last two campaigns 600 m and 750 m respectively temporal resolution 3 min diffusive ch4 flux was estimated based on the

discharge data inflow and outflow during all campaigns were retrieved from the china three gorges corporation fig s2 we derived midstream water depths by subtracting the riverbed elevation li et al 2020a from the surface water level population data were obtained from the sixth national population census of china fig 1 and table s1 data for the processed sewage discharge were retrieved from a database of urban sewage treatment facilities in operation in china for the year 2014 table s1 physico chemical properties of the surface water water temperature dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity were measured at sections close to major cities towns and confluences of tributaries in the first and third campaigns during the other two campaigns measurements were conducted simultaneously with dissolved gas concentration sampling fig s3 note that measurements in two campaigns in 2018 were based on a multi parameter probe ds5 hach usa while in the third and fourth campaigns we used a ysi multi parameter probe exo2 ysi usa the geographic locations of all measurements were determined based on the gps coordinates of the boat 2 4 sampling effort evaluation of dissolved ch4 concentrations although high resolution measurements are critical to reliably capturing the magnitude and spatial patterns of ghg fluxes and concentrations in reservoirs these sampling campaigns are time consuming and expensive especially in large reservoirs e g the tgr therefore we conducted downsampling simulations paranaíba et al 2018 wik et al 2016 to determine the minimum number of sampling sites per kilometer required to obtain a high accuracy representative mean dissolved ch4 concentration of the tgr the assumption of these simulations is that our high resolution sampling campaigns can sufficiently capture the spatial variations of surface water ch4 concentrations for the entire reservoir compared to the mean concentrations from our campaigns the result of the minimum sampling effort should have a relative error within 20 with high confidence 95 probability paranaíba et al 2018 wik et al 2016 the four campaigns have 156 32274 36052 and 32424 sampling sites points n respectively in the hypothetical downsampling scenarios we created n bins for each campaign with i th bin consisting of 100 combinations of i measurements randomly drawn from the entire observational dataset without replacement for each combination for example the first bin has 100 combinations of one data point viz 100 data points representing 100 possible experiments that each has one randomly selected sampling site while the second bin has 100 combinations of two data points representing 100 possible experiments that each has two sampling sites the number of data points in each combination represents the number of sampling sites for the entire sampled section 645 km based upon the simulations we estimated the chance of reaching high accuracy concentration estimate and the risks of overestimates and underestimates 3 results 3 1 hydrologic conditions and limnological variables the mean discharge from the tgd during the summer campaign 29032 120 m3 s 1 was approximately threefold higher than during winter campaigns 6228 149 m3 s 1 6782 1031 m3 s 1 and 7797 1625 m3 s 1 in november december and january respectively during the summer campaign in 2018 the water level at the tgd 155 3 0 5 m decreased continuously by about 2 m from 156 m to 154 m but was still relatively higher than the normal low water level 145 m due to a recent flood fig s2 compared to that during the summer campaign the water level during winter was higher and more stable the water levels were 174 4 0 1 m and 174 3 0 1 m in november and december respectively and slightly decreased from 173 8 to 172 7 m during the january campaign fig s2 note that these three winter campaigns cover not only different months after the end of the flood season but also variations in water level along with the summer campaign they provide unique opportunities to examine dissolved ch4 concentrations under different hydrologic conditions and sediment deposition conditions dissolved oxygen concentrations were similar during all four campaigns with minor variations the ranges of dissolved oxygen concentrations were 7 5 8 5 mg l 1 8 3 9 3 mg l 1 7 1 8 4 mg l 1 and 7 3 8 2 mg l 1 in four campaigns fig s3 as suggested by the profile measurements at 12 sites in the third campaign dissolved oxygen in the water column was well oxygenated fig s4 dissolved oxygen in general gradually decreased from upstream to downstream in all four campaigns although with a rapid increase from fengjie fj to zg in the first campaign water temperatures during the winter campaigns gradually increased from upstream to downstream along the reservoir fig s3 in contrast fluctuating water temperatures were observed in summer especially between zhongxian zx and zg as the air temperature drops water temperatures in the fourth campaign 14 5 0 4 c were slightly lower than in the third one 15 8 1 4 c note that we did not observe clear thermal stratifications in the third campaign the water temperature difference between the surface and bottom layers was less than 1 c at all profile sites fig s4 the summer campaign had much lower electrical conductivity 338 5 7 8 µs cm 1 than winter ones 374 5 14 1 µs cm 1 425 1 16 7 µs cm 1 and 411 3 11 9 µs cm 1 in the second third and fourth campaigns respectively fig s3 similar to the longitudinal changes of dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity in general decreased from upstream to downstream in all four campaigns with a continuous rise near the tgd only in the summer campaign most of the measured physico chemical parameters had relatively smoother trends along the reservoir during winter campaigns than during the summer one 3 2 dissolved ch4 concentrations and diffusive ch4 fluxes the spatial distributions of the measured dissolved ch4 concentrations are shown in figs 2 and 3 clear spatial variations were observed dissolved ch4 concentrations are generally greater in the upstream than in the downstream with a rapid change near the middle section of the tgr hereafter gradient region the longitudinal distributions were relatively consistent in all four campaigns despite the differences in water level temperatures and other conditions meanwhile the observed concentrations in different campaigns were on average quite similar although with seasonal variations 0 26 0 19 μm 0 33 0 27 μm 0 22 0 16 μm and 0 26 0 18 μm in the first second third and fourth campaigns respectively the surface water was supersaturated with ch4 with dissolved concentrations being 93 103 65 and 75 times the corresponding atmospheric equilibrium concentrations in four campaigns table s2 summarizes the measured ch4 concentrations in the upper middle and lower sections of the tgr see section 2 1 in summer the dissolved ch4 gradually decreased from the upper section to the lower section although with several sudden drops between cq and wanzhou wz the maximum ch4 concentrations were observed in the upper section close to cq in comparison ch4 concentrations first increased from the upper section to the middle section then decreased further downstream in winter see also figs 2 and 3 the maximum concentrations mainly occurred between fuling fl and zx the mean concentrations and their spatial and seasonal variations in the lower section were much lower than those in the upper and middle sections in both seasons table s2 it is noteworthy that seasonally dependent peaks and drops in ch4 concentrations were found near the confluences of tributaries corresponding to the location of major cities and counties local peaks of dissolved ch4 in the river channel occurred in several counties during winter campaigns which turned to sudden drops in summer due primarily to the seasonal tributary inflows examples are fl fengdu fd zx and wz see fig 3 a gradient region with rapid changes in ch4 concentrations decreasing from upstream to downstream was observed in all campaigns in which concentration changes along the reservoir were nearly linear figs 2 and 3 the gradient region in the summer campaign spanned across the entire middle section and even extended into the upper section in comparison the gradient regions in winter campaigns were much smaller and were generally located between zx and yunyang yy with relatively fewer longitudinal fluctuations the length of the gradient region in summer 320 km was approximately two times greater than its winter counterpart we then evaluated the rate of concentration decrease μm km 1 with a simple linear regression model the slopes of regression models are shown in fig 3 the decreasing rates in winter campaigns were much greater than in the summer one and the largest decreasing rate was observed in the third campaign 0 005 μm km 1 the estimation of diffusive ch4 flux further suggests that the tgr on average is a net source of atmospheric ch4 table s2 the diffusive ch4 flux in the summer campaign was 16 2 21 8 mg m 2 d 1 much greater than those in winter 3 9 3 3 mg m 2 d 1 2 5 1 9 mg m 2 d 1 and 2 9 2 0 mg m 2 d 1 in november december and january respectively in comparison to the dissolved ch4 concentration the diffusive flux exhibited a more pronounced seasonal variability with the mean flux in summer being 3 5 times higher than in winter meanwhile the upper and middle sections of the tgr were hot spots of diffusive ch4 emissions in both seasons especially the mean diffusive flux in the upper section was 5 7 times that of the lower section table s2 3 3 determinants of dissolved ch4 concentrations in both seasons dissolved ch4 concentrations observed near major counties were positively related to sewage discharges p 0 05 based on a two tailed t test but negatively related to midstream water depth p 0 05 fig 4 a and b note that we did not include cq the largest city in the tgr region in the regression analysis for sewage discharge considering the strong influence of its extremely high discharge fd and zx were also excluded from fig 4a due to the contributions of disproportionately high stoichiometric reservoir sedimentation to ch4 accumulation in the middle section li et al 2020a sewage discharge and water depth explained up to 91 and 73 of the observed variance in ch4 concentrations respectively with higher coefficients of determination r2 in summer than in winter the relationships between ch4 concentrations and electrical conductivity were analyzed for the second and fourth high resolution winter campaigns during which we sailed upstream and downstream respectively as shown in fig 4c and d the slope of the linear regression between the dissolved ch4 and electrical conductivity was positive for low concentrations but became negative for ch4 concentrations above a certain threshold turning point the turning points were 0 56 μμ for the second campaign and 0 40 μμ for the fourth one concentrations around the turning point were observed at locations close to zx in both campaigns figs 3 and s3 in addition the linear relationships were relatively weaker for concentrations higher than the turning points as suggested by the lower r2 from the regression models below the turning points the slopes of the linear regression models between concentration and electrical conductivity were nearly identical in both campaigns fig 4c and d r2 0 5 this suggests that electrical conductivity was a good predictor of dissolved ch4 concentrations downstream of zx in winter 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variability of dissolved ch4 concentrations our high resolution longitudinal surveys over a 645 km distance revealed large spatial variability of ch4 concentrations in the surface water of the tgr figs 2 and 3 this heterogeneity reflects the collective influence of topographical conditions the confluence of tributaries sewage discharges from major counties along the river and environmental and limnological variables we found that dissolved ch4 concentrations were relatively lower in the lower section than in the upper and middle sections of the reservoir fig 3 several hot spots peaks of dissolved ch4 concentrations observed in the upper and middle sections in all four campaigns are likely due to sewage discharges from nearby cities and counties see fig 4a this is consistent with a previous study li et al 2020b in which local peaks of co2 and ch4 emissions corresponded well with major cities along the yangtze river in fact wastewater produced by anthropogenic activities in urban areas has been suggested to substantially contribute to ch4 emission yang et al 2020 for example according to the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant from the state environmental protection administration of china in 2003 the wastewater discharges produced by the entire municipality of chongqing alone total wastewater was 587 8 million m3 or 1458 million t in 2014 note that 1 t 1000 kg can lead to approximately 0 59 t of dissolved ch4 discharged to the river and released into the atmosphere it is noteworthy that the urban expansion and population growth in cities downstream of cq along the tgr are largely limited by complex geographical and topographical conditions figs 1 and 2 this lack of human activities between cities further contributes to the observed strong spatial heterogeneity in ch4 concentrations figs 1 and 3 compared to other sections the upstream part of the middle section in general had relatively high ch4 concentrations figs 2 and 3 the high concentrations in this section result not only from wastewater discharges from large cities but also from the increased sediment deposition the longitudinally decreasing flow velocity and increasing water retention time in this section jointly lead to the increased deposition of sediments transported from the upstream especially between fl and zx li et al 2018 considering the nearly well mixed hydrodynamic condition in the mainstream of the tgr zhao et al 2013 anaerobic methane production in the water column was limited fig s4 and the observed ch4 accumulation was most likely fueled by the production in the sediment in addition the linear relationship between electrical conductivity and ch4 in this section was very weak fig 4c and d possibly owing to the disturbance of the additional methane production by sedimentation a gradient region with nearly linearly decreasing ch4 concentrations toward downstream was observed in all campaigns relatively higher ch4 concentrations and electrical conductivity upstream of zx served as a source to diffuse downstream with the flow creating a smooth concentration gradient in this region especially in winter figs 3 and s3 moreover the upstream end of the winter gradient regions was at zx which also corresponds to the turning points of the linear relationship between dissolved ch4 and electrical conductivity fig 4c and d wastewater can be considered as a common source of elevated dissolved ch4 concentration and electrical conductivity therefore the strong linear relationship between dissolved ch4 and electrical conductivity in the section downstream of zx suggests that electrical conductivity as a conservative proxy for material transport can be a potential predictor of the ch4 concentration moreover the linear regressions between ch4 concentration and electrical conductivity below the turning points were nearly identical in both winter campaigns partially because of the regular operation of the tgr the relatively lower and more stable ch4 concentrations in the lower section partly result from the geographical conditions and low level of urbanization figs 1 3 about 96 of the tgr catchment is mountainous with gorges from fj to zg li 2018 where the gorges are dominated by granite and limestone rocks and shallow nutrient poor and acidic soils which cannot support rapid vegetation growth hu and cheng 2013 in addition most settlements in this section are small villages and towns as a result the organic matter input in this section is much lower than upstream ones moreover the backwater area from cq to fl and highly curved channels near zx with decreased flow velocity facilitate sediment deposition in upstream sections further decreases sediments and the associated ch4 production in this section the significant negative correlations between water depth and ch4 concentration in both seasons indicate that water depth is another determinant the oxygen enriched water column in the tgr as an inevitable pathway from sediment to surface water for ch4 emission influences the concentration of dissolved ch4 in the surface water via oxidation lei et al 2019 wang et al 2014 which explains the lower ch4 concentrations in this section with large water depth near the tgd fig s1 4 2 temporal variability of dissolved ch4 concentrations the tgr changes from river state in summer to lake state in winter while the water level increases from 145 m to 175 m due to reservoir operation li 2018 this reservoir operation substantially alters the water retention time less than 20 days in summer vs approximately 80 days in winter such strong fluctuations of water level have been suggested to significantly affect the biogeochemical processes e g dynamics of nutrients in the tgr the interactions between the mainstream and tributaries and therefore the spatial distribution of dissolved ch4 long et al 2020 yang et al 2018 for example yang et al 2018 found that nutrient concentrations in the tributaries of the tgr were irregular due to the exchange between tributary flow and mainstream intrusion in the rainy season it is reasonable to believe that dissolved ch4 concentrations in the mainstream of the tgr can also be affected by the inflow from tributaries during different seasons the summer campaign was conducted after a flood event in summer floods in the mainstream of the tgr often carry higher levels of dissolved ch4 discharged from major cities see section 4 1 compared to those from mountainous areas tributaries therefore the dissolved ch4 in the mainstream can be diluted by the tributary inflows this dilution effect has been reported for nutrient concentration in the tgr in previous studies huang et al 2014 yang et al 2018 and apparently also contributed to the observed sudden drops in dissolved ch4 concentrations at confluences of tributaries figs 2 and 3 during the winter campaigns the very low water discharge and the possible presence of intrusive density currents from the mainstream in the bottom layer of tributaries yang et al 2018 largely limited the transport of dissolved ch4 from tributaries which explains the absence of sudden drops instead we observed more pronounced local peaks in ch4 concentrations at some confluences of tributaries near several major cities and industrial areas likely due to the discharge of untreated wastewater fig 3 and table s1 this highlights the important role that tributaries play in the seasonal variations of ch4 concentrations in the tgr seasonal differences were also observed in the spatial distribution of dissolved ch4 the gradient region in summer was more unsteady and had a relatively lower gradient of dissolved ch4 concentration than in winter fig 3 during the flood season in summer most of the tgr s organic carbon inputs are from sediments and sewage water discharge from upstream the hydrodynamic conditions with high flow velocity and low water level river state formed by the flood discharge promote the high dissolved ch4 from the upstream to decrease downstream along the reservoir liu et al 2012 sha et al 2015 resulting in a long gradient region in comparison the lake state in winter results in much slower material transport along the reservoir and the production and persistence of ch4 exhibit clear local scale characteristics see sections 3 2 and 4 1 therefore the gradient region is much shorter than in summer with a relatively higher decreasing rate we also observed differences in the gradient region among the three winter campaigns the second campaign in 2018 was conducted about one month after the water level of the tgd reached 175 m normal water level and the transition from river state to lake state led to a decreasing rate stronger than the summer one but weaker than those in the last two campaigns compared to the third campaign the fourth campaign experienced increased outflow fig s2c and flow velocity in the downstream sections this hydrodynamic changes within a short period decreased the rate of concentration change in the gradient region fig 3 meanwhile the upstream and downstream ends of the gradient region shifted toward fd and the tgd respectively the change from the third to fourth campaigns is also consistent with the lower decreasing rate and longer gradient region observed in summer highlighting that the changing hydrodynamics due to reservoir operation is indeed a critical factor driving the longitudinal distribution of dissolved ch4 in the tgr 4 3 comparisons with previous studies in the tgr and other reservoirs the dissolved ch4 concentrations and diffusive ch4 fluxes observed in all campaigns confirm that the tgr is a net source of atmospheric ch4 which is generally consistent with previous studies table 1 the estimated mean diffusive ch4 emissions here are of the same order of magnitude as most existing flux measurements in the mainstream and tributaries of the tgr but slightly higher than some point based measurements at sites close to the tgd compared to winter higher temperature and more organic carbon input are conducive to higher ch4 production and emissions in summer grinham et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2015 as a result the ch4 flux observed in summer was about 4 2 times higher than in winter this is in agreement with yang et al 2013a in which the ratios of summer to winter fluxes at yy ws and zg were 7 2 3 4 and 1 7 respectively it is noteworthy that the section from cq to fl where we observed ch4 emission hot spots has been rarely studied previously the insufficient study in this reservoir section might introduce large uncertainties when estimating the ch4 emission from the entire tgr in addition the observed mean diffusive ch4 flux in our study 9 65 mg m 2 d 1 the weighted average of four campaigns was greater than that of pre impoundment and initial impoundment conditions but close to the level observed seven years after the trial impoundment in 2008 li et al 2020b 2020c this suggests that the diffusive ch4 flux in the tgr might have stabilized as influenced by the oxygenated water column the reduction in nutrient loading and dam operations deemer et al 2016 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 we further compare our observations with studies in other reservoirs table 2 the ch4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes in the tgr are in the range of observations in many subtropical and temperate reservoirs such as a costal reservoir affected by sewage yang et al 2020 and the cascading reservoirs in the upper mekong river and saar river liu et al 2020 maeck et al 2013 the differences in ch4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes between the upper and lower sections of the tgr table s2 are also in agreement with observations in several small reservoirs by wang et al 2017 in which the authors found that reservoirs affected by urban areas had relatively higher emissions and concentrations than those within natural landscapes e g forests however the tgr has much lower ch4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes than some tropical reservoirs in brazil where high resolution measurements have been conducted paranaíba et al 2018 note that here we only compare the diffusive flux while in many reservoirs listed in table 2 bubbling was an important pathway of the ch4 emission liu et al 2020 maeck et al 2013 especially frequent ebullition is common in many temperate sub tropical and tropical reservoirs where the water depth is less than 40 m delsontro et al 2011 grinham et al 2018 tušer et al 2017 in contrast bubbling is relatively rare and unimportant in the mainstream of the tgr which is mainly because of the large water depth and resulting high hydrostatic pressure in the mainstream sediments negligible ebullition fluxes from the tgr mainstream are also supported by our previous investigations at gjb in the mainstream using an echo sounder simrad ey60 norway in which no clear bubbles were detected unpublished data therefore the total ch4 emission from the mainstream of the tgr might be much lower than from shallower reservoirs with substantial ebullitive emissions 4 4 downsampling simulations of different sampling sites and minimum sampling effort the results of the downsampling simulations based on measurements from all four campaigns are shown in fig 5 as expected as the number of sampling sites per kilometer increases the chance of high accuracy mean concentration estimates also increases highlighting the importance of high resolution measurements to obtain a representative mean dissolved ch4 concentration of the tgr relative error within 20 with high confidence see section 2 4 the minimum numbers of sampling sites in summer and winter are 0 06 per kilometer and 0 08 0 09 per kilometer or equivalently one site every 17 4 km and one site every 11 3 12 6 km respectively the minimum numbers of sites required in winter campaigns are slightly higher than in summer due to the greater variations in dissolved ch4 e g local peaks see section 3 2 fig 5b c and d the risks of overestimates and underestimates with the minimum sampling effort are nearly identical 2 5 we further estimated the chance of achieving high accuracy with a relative error within 20 dissolved ch4 concentration estimates with a single sampling site in the entire tgr the probabilities for four campaigns under the single site scenario are 12 11 12 and 14 the lowest orange circles in fig 5 in other words the probabilities of underestimates overestimates are 88 87 88 or 86 it is clear that although the numbers of sampling sites differed among the four campaigns the minimum sampling effort and probabilities of errors are consistent the estimation of minimum sampling effort is informative for the design of future field measurements in large reservoirs such as the tgr according to the downsampling simulations the minimum sampling effort is one site every 17 4 km in summer or equivalently 38 sites for the entire 660 km tgr compared to summer measurements winter campaigns need more sites to capture the strong variations in ch4 concentrations e g local peaks figs 2 and 3 the minimum sampling effort in winter is one site every 11 3 12 6 km or equivalently 52 58 sites for the entire tgr meanwhile the probability of achieving high accuracy concentration measurements in the tgr with only one site is less than 14 our investigation partly explains the inconsistent results of previous carbon emission surveys in the tgr in which the sampling sites were insufficient and usually located in the confluences of tributaries and counties e g xiao et al 2013b yang et al 2013a in addition our results suggest that scaling concentrations and emissions for the entire tgr from a single or from few sampling sites i e less than 38 58 depending on the season is unlikely to yield a high accuracy result consistent with a previous study in tropical reservoirs paranaíba et al 2018 5 conclusions we conducted four high resolution mapping campaigns of dissolved ch4 concentrations using a fast response automated gas equilibrator in different seasons and estimated diffusive ch4 fluxes in the tgr the spatial and temporal variability of ch4 concentrations in the tgr was strong with relatively higher local scale effects concentration peaks in winter than in summer dissolved ch4 in the tgr was always supersaturated during all sampling campaigns suggesting that the tgr is the source of atmospheric ch4 in both seasons the spatial variation in dissolved ch4 concentrations was mainly determined by sewage discharge from cities and counties sedimentation and topographical conditions the temporal variation mainly resulted from seasonal reservoir operation and changes in tributary flows the associated diffusive ch4 fluxes were 16 2 mg m 2 d 1 and 3 1 mg m 2 d 1 in summer and winter respectively downsampling simulations show that at least 38 sites and 52 58 sites are needed to capture the dissolved ch4 concentration of the entire tgr in summer and winter respectively while results scaled from one or a few sampling sites are unlikely to represent the entire reservoir this highlights that high resolution mapping campaigns are critical to depicting longitudinal variations of ghg concentrations and emissions and reducing uncertainties in large reservoirs such as the tgr it is noteworthy that our sampling campaigns were in the most representative seasons summer and winter whereas the conditions in other seasons especially during the transition period between river state and lake state of the tgr with strong water level fluctuations remain unexplored in addition as the first step we only investigated ch4 concentrations and estimated diffusive fluxes while the high resolution mapping of co2 emissions and other ghgs is also imperative to reveal the spatial and temporal variability nevertheless as the first high resolution ch4 concentration measurements in this region this study reveals the spatial and temporal dynamics of dissolved ch4 concentrations and their potential determinants our findings shed light on the field campaigns in not only the tgr but also other similar large reservoirs in the world highlighting the need for high resolution measurements to accurately estimate ghg concentrations and emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests acknowledgements this work
