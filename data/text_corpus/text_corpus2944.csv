14720,comprehension of the spatial and temporal characteristics of non point source nps pollution risk in watersheds is essential for nps pollution research and scientific management although the concept of water functional zones wfz has been considered in the nps pollution risk assessment process however no comprehensive study of the nps pollution risk has been conducted to effectively protect water quality in watersheds with different water environment capacity therefore this study proposes a new nps pollution risk assessment method that integrates water functional zoning receiving water body environmental capacity and space time distribution of pollution load for quantifying the impact of pollution discharge from sub catchment on nearby water body quality based on the nps nutrient loss process modeled by the soil and water assessment tool swat this method was used to assess the nps pollution risk in the le an river watershed at annual and monthly scales the results showed that the nps pollution risk is characterized by seasonal and spatial variability and is influenced clearly by the water environment capacity high nps pollution loads are not necessarily high pollution risks conversely a low nps nutrient pollution load does not represent a low regional risk sensitivity in addition nps risk assessment based on the water environment capacity could also distinguish the differences in risk levels that were masked by similar nps pollutant loss and the same water function zoning to achieve accurate control of nps pollution management in watersheds

parkes et al 2010 stable watershed ecosystems play an important role in sustainable development by supplying various functions such as the provision of drinking water flood storage and aquaculture cline and collins 2003 hamel et al 2018 during the last few decades human activities such as agricultural cultivation livestock farming and residential life caused unorganized emissions of pollutants which led to non point source pollution npsp hua et al 2019 zhang and wang 2002 non point source nps pollutants enter the nearby receiving water through precipitation runoff infiltration and soil erosion processes ultimately leading to excessive water nutrient loads chen et al 2019 ouyang et al 2012 ramos et al 2019 consequently the river water quality in the watershed worsens increasing the risk of destruction in the watershed hydro ecological system including eutrophication the issue of water ecological security in watersheds caused by nps pollution has always been highly scrutinized by worldwide researchers carpenter et al 1998 lai et al 2011 wang et al 2019 previous studies have shown that 30 50 of global water bodies suffer from varying degrees of nps pollution corwin et al 1998 which puts global water security under severe threat and makes nps pollution management research urgent at present researches on nps pollution in watersheds were more mature and mainly concentrated on the following four aspects 1 a quantitative study of accounting nps pollution load based on the export coefficient method model and other means hua et al 2019 liu et al 2018 tong et al 2017 2 exploring the impact of the driving factors such as land use change and climate change on nps pollutant loss individually and in combination el khoury et al 2015 mehan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 it included scenario projections of the different driving factors in light of future socioeconomic developments 3 assessing the effects of different land management practices on the nps pollutant loss process in watersheds and further identifying best management practices badrzadeh et al 2022 liu et al 2013 4 grading the risk of nps pollution and determining priority management areas pmas or critical source areas csas chen et al 2014 liu et al 2016 zuo et al 2022 these efforts typically include qualitative evaluation of indicator systems represented by the potential nps pollution index pnpi and analysis of mechanism models represented by the agricultural nps pollution model agnps and the soil and water assessment tool swat shen et al 2015 shi et al 2020 most of these studies were grounded in the spatial distribution of nps pollution load with a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors to assess risk and identify critical areas the findings provided scientific support for the watershed nps pollution treatment and management however these methods focus on land surface processes before pollutants enter the water body huang et al 2022 liu et al 2016 zuo et al 2022 and may be of limited use for watersheds with water functional zones wfz because the environmental threat of a pollutant cannot be confirmed without considering its effects on the water environment other than that upstream inputs should also be considered in such a process as they may also lead to changes in the water environment capacity of a particular site downstream wei et al 2013 thus using these approaches is not always practical because the regional water environment capacity varies in response to different hydrological conditions and the distribution of environmental pollutants despite the widespread use of water functional zoning worldwide fewer studies have further considered the water environmental capacity of pollutants so it is essential to integrate the actual status of multiple functional zones and their corresponding water environment capacity into the risk assessment process to achieve more effective management of nps pollution considering the abovementioned issues this study proposed a method for judging the risk of nps pollution which integrated the spatial distribution of watershed nps nutrient pollution load water functional zoning and the environmental capacity of receiving water bodies we used this method to assess the nps nutrient pollution risk in a case study of the le an river watershed representing a typical monsoonal zone small watershed the study clarified the nps nutrient loss from watershed on a spatial temporal scale and divided the risk of nps pollution concerning the regional water environment capacity based on annual monthly scales an exploration was made into the influence of pollutant environmental capacity on the spatial temporal distribution of nps risks in the watershed the results obtained in this study can provide helpful information for accurately capturing the contribution of non point source pollution to the watershed water environment and formulating watershed water pollution control strategies 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area this research selected the le an river watershed in jiangxi province as the study area le an river is the main tributary of rao river in poyang lake basin situated between 116 50 118 25 longitude and 28 57 29 60 latitude fig 1 the total length of the river is 279 km and the watershed covers an area of approximately 8376 km2 the river crosses the hilly area into the plain area from northeast to southwest before finally merging with changjiang river into poyang lake as shown in fig 1a the study area elevation ranges from 109 m to 1590 m the climate type of the watershed belongs to subtropical warm and humid monsoonal weather with an annual average temperature of 17 c pei et al 2019 the annual average precipitation observed from 1990 to 2020 is 1772 3 mm and 67 of the total annual precipitation occurs during the wet season april september xiao et al 2011 yu et al 2015 mountains and hills account for over 70 of the total watershed area while plains occupy less than 30 soil types are mainly red loam and rice soil accounting for 71 and 22 of the total area respectively lan and liu 2015 teng et al 2010 land use types in the watershed include 24 9 arable land 70 6 forest and 3 2 residential commercial areas the main crops are rice oilseed rape and tea trees over the past ten years nutrient concentrations in the le an river watershed increased due to farming and fertilization activities seriously affecting the water quality of poyang lake the le an river watershed is the region s main source of water for industry landscape recreation and residential drinking water according to national environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 the whole watershed consists of four types of water functional zones the water quality standards from class i to class iv correspond to good and poor water quality respectively as shown in fig 1c the sewage outfalls along the river channel are concentrated in the midstream and downstream sections of the watershed mainly discharging from industrial parks and mining areas 2 2 data acquisition the datasets used in this research include water quality meteorological agricultural management and spatial data monthly streamflow data and monthly nh3 n tp concentration data of the three hydrological water quality stations i e sandu xiangtun and shizhenjie were obtained from the ecological environment monitoring center of jiangxi province these monitoring data were used to calibrate and validate the hydrological model the 1990 2020 meteorological data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed of 21 stations in the le an river watershed were extracted from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and national scientific data center of tibetan plateau http bdc casnw net agricultural management data including tillage and fertilizer application were derived from the jiangxi statistical yearbook for the major rotation crops the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer applied was 315 6 kg ha per year and 179 9 kg ha per year respectively the point source pollution discharged by domestic and industry was obtained from the statistical and monitoring data of the ecological environment monitoring center of jiangxi province the le an river watershed water function zone was divided based on the jiangxi surface water function zone map spatial data such as digital elevation model dem land use soil type and slope were used to construct the soil and water assessment tool swat model dem data of the watershed with 30 m spatial resolution was extracted from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem supplied by the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the slope was derived from the dem data fig s1 land use data 1990 2020 were acquired from the 30 m china annual land cover products produced by prof xin huang s team at wuhan university and classified into six categories according to the standard swat land use classification fig s1 soil data at a scale of 1 1 million were downloaded from the national scientific data center of tibetan plateau the database is established based on the harmonized world soil database hwsd constructed by the international institute of applied systems analysis iiasa parameter values for each soil type were calculated using the soil plant atmosphere water model spaw software and relevant empirical formulae 2 3 numerical simulation of nps nitrogen and phosphorus loss using swat the swat is widely used for nps simulation and impact assessment and it can highlight the influences of land management under complex and variable conditions ouyang et al 2017 as input data dem land use type soil type meteorological data and actual cultivation management data were used for model construction based on the dem data the actual river network and the threshold value of contributing area 200 km2 the le an river watershed was divided into 27 sub catchments using the arcgis hydrological analysis function the sub catchments were further categorized into different hydrological response units hrus depending on the minimum threshold ratios of reclassified land use soil and slope 0 5 and 10 respectively the effects of different substrate conditions and land management practices on hydrologic processes and nutrient losses of the hrus were quantified for each sub catchment wang et al 2020a in this study the swat simulated the runoff and nutrient loss processes in the le an river watershed from 1990 to 2020 including a 1 year warm up period the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e percent bias p b i a s mean absolute percentage error m a p e and correlation coefficient r 2 were the common

is the number of measured data 2 4 risk assessment methodology and classification this study quantified the impact of non point source tn and tp loss loads from the sub catchments on their nearby water quality by incorporating the environmental capacity targets of the corresponding water functional areas in the sub catchments and assessed their risk levels specifically a watershed model was used to determine the amount of nps pollution loss at the watershed scale then the water environment capacity of the tn and tp in the sub catchment was calculated taking into account upstream inputs and point source discharges finally parameters were defined to quantify the risk of nps nutrient loss based on the watershed model the pollutant load discharged from the sub catchment to the nearby water body was quantified the sub catchments were divided into hrus in the swat model so that the total nps pollutant load discharged from each sub catchment was the sum of the emission from the hrus 5 p i n p s j 1 n a h r u i j c h r u i j where p i n p s is the total non point source pollution load discharged from sub catchment i kg a h r u i j and c h r u i j are the area ha and loss intensity kg ha of h r u j in sub catchment i respectively n represents the number of hydrological response units with consideration of upstream input the water environment capacity for the pollutants in each sub catchment was calculated by combining the water quality standard for the water function zone 6 w i α 86 4 q i c i s t c i u p 10 3 k v i c i s t where w i is the water environmental capacity of pollutants in sub catchment i kg d α is the inhomogeneity coefficient used for the correction of water environmental capacity q i represents the upstream input flow of sub catchment i m3 s c i u p is the pollutant concentration of upstream influent water mg l c i s t represents the water quality standard of the corresponding water function zone mg l k represents the pollutant degradation coefficient 1 d v i is the water body volume of sub catchment i combined with regional point source discharges the actual water environment capacity of the sub catchment is as follows 7 w i r w i p i p o i n t where w i r is the actual water environment capacity of sub catchment i kg d p i p o i n t is the pollution load discharged from the point source in sub catchment i pollutants were retained during conveyance in the river due to physical transport chemical transformation and the action of aquatic organisms therefore the retention factor r i was used as the indicator to estimate the efficiency of river transport expressed as 8 r i r i c h i i n r i c h i o u t r i c h i i n where r i c h i i n and r i c h i o u t are the river input and output quantities in the swat output file respectively thus the corrected nps pollutant flux in a particular river reach can be expressed as 9 p i n p s r i p i n p s where p i n p s represents the non point source pollutant flux at the downstream section of sub catchment i finally risk values r v i were calculated to quantify the impact of nps pollution discharges in the sub catchment on surrounding water bodies which were then used as the basis to classify the risk level table 1 10 r v i p i n p s w i r i 1 2 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the swat simulated runoff nh3 n and tp were compared with the observed values at the downstream hydrological water quality station shizhenjie in the le an river watershed in fig 2 a comparison of observed and simulated values of runoff and nps pollution quality for the two midstream and upstream stations namely xiangtun and sandu was described in figs s2 and s3 the model calibration period was 2008 2012 and the validation period was 2013 2015 the n s e coefficients p b i a s and m a p e for runoff during calibration and validation at the three hydrologic water quality sites ranged from 0 85 to 0 94 2 04 24 48 and 0 28 0 66 respectively the n s e coefficients and p b i a s for nh3 n and tp were lower than that of runoff with values in the range of 0 60 0 90 and 31 98 32 60 respectively m a p e values during calibration and validation of the contaminants were taken to be between 0 28 and 0 71 the results were comparable to the simulated results of swat in other watersheds zhai et al 2014 previous studies showed that the simulation results were acceptable when r 2 0 6 n s e 0 50 and m a p e values between 0 and 1 gassman et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 furthermore the results were satisfactory if the p b i a s of runoff and pollutants were within 25 and 70 respectively ma et al 2021 with the n s e coefficient 0 50 r 2 0 70 as well as p b i a s and m a p e values between reasonable ranges the le an river watershed model calibration results were considered satisfactory therefore the calibrated swat model can be used for the subsequent long series nutrient flux analysis 3 2 characteristics of nps nutrient loss in the watershed based on the simulation results the differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of nutrient loss and loss intensity in the le an river watershed were compared in 2014 fig 3 the intensity of tn loss in the whole watershed ranged from 0 033 kg ha and 6 367 kg ha with a monthly average value of 1 571 kg ha the tp loss intensity ranged from 0 002 kg ha to 1 256 kg ha with an average value of 0 263 kg ha as shown in fig 3 a the loss intensity of the tn and tp in the watershed in 2014 both peaked and valleyed in march and december respectively and the peaks were 4 05 and 4 77 times the monthly average value that indicated an apparent monthly variation in nutrient loss this phenomenon may be explained by the seasonal variation of rainfall in monsoon areas and the discrepancy in land use patterns previous studies have demonstrated that watershed land surface nps nutrient loss is associated with regional rainfall intensity frequency and land use cover patterns li et al 2022 tong and chen 2002 wang et al 2019 seasonal rainfall variability led to apparent changes in land use patterns and vegetation cover wu and lu 2019 which implied that there were also notable monthly variations in fertilizer use among watershed agroforestry systems furthermore a large proportion of nps nutrient loss comes from the long term use of chemical fertilizers ouyang et al 2018 it was evident that march was the planting season for early rice in the le an river watershed with the accompanying application of basal fertilizer meanwhile the precipitation amounted to 227 8 mm in march and the monthly frequency was 22 days including 8 days with 10 mm besides winter precipitation and agricultural activities were infrequent at the watershed therefore the loss intensity of tn and tp in the watershed unavoidably exhibited inter month disparity analyzing the spatial differences of nutrient loss in the watershed revealed that tn and tp loss was present in the southwest central northeast and the amount of tn and tp loss in the southwest was 92 and 87 of the sum of the loss in the central and northeast respectively likewise the nutrient loss varied widely among sub catchments fig 3 the sub catchments 22 and 23 located in the southwestern part of the watershed had high loss intensity of tn with 27 93 kg ha and 28 88 kg ha respectively the high intensity of tp loss was found in sub catchments 23 and 27 with intensity of 4 36 kg ha and 4 37 kg ha respectively it can be seen that the sub catchments with high intensity of nutrient loss were mainly concentrated in the middle and downstream areas of the watershed and the intensity of nps tn loss was much greater than that of nps tp a possible reason for this may be that the region included 73 33 of the cropland and 70 41 of the construction land in the watershed and the soil type was dominated by rice soils as known land use type and soil properties were the major influences on the spatial disparity of nutrient loss in the watershed djodjic et al 2021 ramos et al 2019 moreover nitrogen loss is significantly influenced by rainfall runoff and soil erosion while phosphorus loss is mainly related to soil erosion due to its chemical nature li et al 2021 xia et al 2013 previous studies have shown that nitrogen is more likely to be lost than phosphorus in plain hilly watersheds zeng et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 long term fertilizer use rural town life and unorganized livestock and poultry farming caused nps nitrogen and phosphorus pollution wu et al 2012 in addition the upstream areas were primarily hilly with dense vegetation which were also less prone to nutrient loss through soil erosion 3 3 risk levels distribution of nps nutrient loss in the watershed 3 3 1 annual scale the 2014 annual risk of nps tn and tp loss in the le an river watershed was assessed using the methodology for calculating risk levels the evaluation results were shown in fig 4 sub catchments no 14 17 and 20 22 were found to have higher exposure to nps tn loss likewise sub catchments no 20 22 were also areas with a higher risk of nps tp loss this suggested that the influence of nps tn and tp loss on the water quality of the nearby water body varied significantly between sub catchments fig 4 from fig 3 it can be seen that these higher risk sub catchments were not all areas with the highest intensity of tn and tp loss but all of them had the risk level of class 5 this finding can be explained by the different water quality standards and water environment capacity of the regional water function zones whose upstream water quality exceeded the standard resulting in a negative water environment capacity of tn and tp zhou et al 2017 it implied no exact positive correlation between the intensity of nps pollutant loss in the sub catchment and its risk category assessing the water pollution hazard caused by non point sources solely through the loss intensity was considered inadequate cheruvelil et al 2008 wang et al 2019 as in the work of shen et al on identifying priority management areas for nps in the daning river watershed shen et al 2015 the nps pollution risk should be considered in the context of water function zone differences 3 3 2 monthly scale following the seasonal rainfall runoff and the characteristics of nps nutrient loss in the watershed li et al 2022 five typical months january march june august and december were selected to explore the monthly variation in the risk of nps tn and tp loss at the rank level the risk values for tn and tp also showed significant differences between months and sub catchments clearly the risk of nps tn and tp loss was higher in march than in other months across the whole watershed fig 5 with the proportion of risk levels 4 and 5 at 85 18 and 77 77 respectively meanwhile the risk of nps tn and tp loss in the same sub catchment differed strongly between months fig 5 b and d which may be related to seasonal variations of nps nutrient pollution load and the water environment capacity so the loss risk values varied between months other than that 59 26 of the sub catchments exhibited much higher risk ratings in the dry season indicating that nps pollution occurred more easily in the dry season than in the flood season this result is at odds with most studies which have concluded that rainfall runoff in wet seasons drives up nps pollutant loss and thus leads to more severe water pollution badrzadeh et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 however fertilizer application in the le an river watershed generally starts in march along with a reduction in water environment capacity owing to decreased flows in the dry season thus making the non point source risk higher in the dry season than flood season there were apparent spatial differences at the sub catchment scale from the distribution of nps pollution risk values in march as in fig 5 e and f excluding cases such as sub catchments 22 and 18 where high nps nutrient pollution load with low or negative water environment capacity resulted in high risks it was found that relatively low nps nutrient pollution load coupled with low or negative water environment capacity also led to high loss risks e g sub catchments 15 and 19 correspondingly it also existed that high loss loads and the large water environment capacity made the relatively low nps pollutant loss risk e g sub catchment 27 the results of the study differ from the risk rating based solely on nps pollution load implying that the impact of water environment capacity on the nps risk assessment process is not negligible consequently a dynamic nps risk assessment approach based on water environment capacity was reasonable as it could be used not only to gain an accurate understanding of the variation in nps tn and tp risk with water environment capacity but also to distinguish differences in risk levels that were masked by similar nps pollutant loss volumes 3 4 risk category variance analysis and management implications the distribution of risk values was observed to differ between sub catchments figs 4 and 5 this discrepancy was caused by spatial differences in nps pollution load and pollutant water environment capacity upstream pollutant input concentrations and channel runoff both affect the water environment capacity bui and pham 2023 wei et al 2013 the redundancy analysis rda also indicated that runoff and upstream input concentrations were the primary reasons for spatial variation in the risk of nps nutrient loss fig 6 in addition the distribution of precipitation and land use also allows for different nps pollution load into a water body wang et al 2020b these driving factors create spatial and temporal heterogeneity in pollution risk making it more difficult for nps pollution governance and management unsurprisingly assessing the risk of nps pollution in watersheds is more efficient based on the water environment capacity first it emphasized the influence of nps pollution on the water quality in each sub catchment which distinguished from most risk assessment approaches focusing merely on land surface processes of nps pollution huang et al 2022 liu et al 2016 only by considering the impact of pollution load on water quality can the threat to the water environment and even the water ecology be identified secondly this method enables to make a preliminary determination of the risk level for nps pollution in the sub catchment based on upstream input concentrations during the pollutant water environment capacity calculation and to determine the regional risk relationship this is similar to the approach proposed by shen et al for the identification of pmas which combines upstream inputs and the water quality standard of the wfz to confirm whether upstream influxes influence regional pollution risks shen et al 2015 the difference is that we have further integrated the regional water environment capacity although the regional water functional zones may be the same the water environment capacity for pollutants is bound to be different due to upstream inputs and runoff our methodology takes such actual conditions of the water environment capacity into account in the risk assessment process and is more conducive to distinguishing risk differences that are masked by the same water function zones and similar nps pollution loads to enable targeted policy development 4 conclusion evaluating the impact of nps pollution load on nearby water bodies is crucial in watershed surface pollution management to our knowledge this study firstly proposes an nps pollution risk assessment method that combines water functional zones the environmental capacity of receiving water body and the time spatial distribution of pollution load for quantifying the impact of sub catchment pollution discharges on the nearby water body quality based on the nps nutrient loss modeled by swat the risk of nps pollution in the le an river watershed was assessed at annual and monthly scales in conjunction with the water environment capacity the results showed that the nps pollution risk was not positively correlated with the nps nutrient loss this is reflected in the spatial and temporal differences in risk values i e a high nps pollution load does not necessarily mean high pollution risk conversely a low nps nutrient pollution load does not represent a low regional risk sensitivity and the nps pollution risk was markedly influenced by the pollutant s water environment capacity the rda also indicated that runoff and upstream inputs both of which determine the water environment capacity were the main reasons for the spatial variation in risk therefore an nps risk assessment based on the water environment capacity would not only accurately understand the seasonal variation in pollution risk with the water environment capacity but also distinguish differences in risk rating that were masked by similar nps pollution loss quantity and the same water function zoning from the perspective of watershed management the results of this study can provide a reference for achieving precise management of nps pollution and effective protection of water quality in multi water functional zoning areas however this study did not consider inter annual variability in nps pollution risk and the distribution of pollution risk under extreme weather events which could be further optimized in subsequent studies credit authorship contribution statement yuanyuan li data curation methodology writing original draft hua wang

50 118 25 longitude and 28 57 29 60 latitude fig 1 the total length of the river is 279 km and the watershed covers an area of approximately 8376 km2 the river crosses the hilly area into the plain area from northeast to southwest before finally merging with changjiang river into poyang lake as shown in fig 1a the study area elevation ranges from 109 m to 1590 m the climate type of the watershed belongs to subtropical warm and humid monsoonal weather with an annual average temperature of 17 c pei et al 2019 the annual average precipitation observed from 1990 to 2020 is 1772 3 mm and 67 of the total annual precipitation occurs during the wet season april september xiao et al 2011 yu et al 2015 mountains and hills account for over 70 of the total watershed area while plains occupy less than 30 soil types are mainly red loam and rice soil accounting for 71 and 22 of the total area respectively lan and liu 2015 teng et al 2010 land use types in the watershed include 24 9 arable land 70 6 forest and 3 2 residential commercial areas the main crops are rice oilseed rape and tea trees over the past ten years nutrient concentrations in the le an river watershed increased due to farming and fertilization activities seriously affecting the water quality of poyang lake the le an river watershed is the region s main source of water for industry landscape recreation and residential drinking water according to national environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 the whole watershed consists of four types of water functional zones the water quality standards from class i to class iv correspond to good and poor water quality respectively as shown in fig 1c the sewage outfalls along the river channel are concentrated in the midstream and downstream sections of the watershed mainly discharging from industrial parks and mining areas 2 2 data acquisition the datasets used in this research include water quality meteorological agricultural management and spatial data monthly streamflow data and monthly nh3 n tp concentration data of the three hydrological water quality stations i e sandu xiangtun and shizhenjie were obtained from the ecological environment monitoring center of jiangxi province these monitoring data were used to calibrate and validate the hydrological model the 1990 2020 meteorological data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed of 21 stations in the le an river watershed were extracted from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and national scientific data center of tibetan plateau http bdc casnw net agricultural management data including tillage and fertilizer application were derived from the jiangxi statistical yearbook for the major rotation crops the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer applied was 315 6 kg ha per year and 179 9 kg ha per year respectively the point source pollution discharged by domestic and industry was obtained from the statistical and monitoring data of the ecological environment monitoring center of jiangxi province the le an river watershed water function zone was divided based on the jiangxi surface water function zone map spatial data such as digital elevation model dem land use soil type and slope were used to construct the soil and water assessment tool swat model dem data of the watershed with 30 m spatial resolution was extracted from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem supplied by the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the slope was derived from the dem data fig s1 land use data 1990 2020 were acquired from the 30 m china annual land cover products produced by prof xin huang s team at wuhan university and classified into six categories according to the standard swat land use classification fig s1 soil data at a scale of 1 1 million were downloaded from the national scientific data center of tibetan plateau the database is established based on the harmonized world soil database hwsd constructed by the international institute of applied systems analysis iiasa parameter values for each soil type were calculated using the soil plant atmosphere water model spaw software and relevant empirical formulae 2 3 numerical simulation of nps nitrogen and phosphorus loss using swat the swat is widely used for nps simulation and impact assessment and it can highlight the influences of land management under complex and variable conditions ouyang et al 2017 as input data dem land use type soil type meteorological data and actual cultivation management data were used for model construction based on the dem data the actual river network and the threshold value of contributing area 200 km2 the le an river watershed was divided into 27 sub catchments using the arcgis hydrological analysis function the sub catchments were further categorized into different hydrological response units hrus depending on the minimum threshold ratios of reclassified land use soil and slope 0 5 and 10 respectively the effects of different substrate conditions and land management practices on hydrologic processes and nutrient losses of the hrus were quantified for each sub catchment wang et al 2020a in this study the swat simulated the runoff and nutrient loss processes in the le an river watershed from 1990 to 2020 including a 1 year warm up period the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e percent bias p b i a s mean absolute percentage error m a p e and correlation coefficient r 2 were the common

water quality by incorporating the environmental capacity targets of the corresponding water functional areas in the sub catchments and assessed their risk levels specifically a watershed model was used to determine the amount of nps pollution loss at the watershed scale then the water environment capacity of the tn and tp in the sub catchment was calculated taking into account upstream inputs and point source discharges finally parameters were defined to quantify the risk of nps nutrient loss based on the watershed model the pollutant load discharged from the sub catchment to the nearby water body was quantified the sub catchments were divided into hrus in the swat model so that the total nps pollutant load discharged from each sub catchment was the sum of the emission from the hrus 5 p i n p s j 1 n a h r u i j c h r u i j where p i n p s is the total non point source pollution load discharged from sub catchment i kg a h r u i j and c h r u i j are the area ha and loss intensity kg ha of h r u j in sub catchment i respectively n represents the number of hydrological response units with consideration of upstream input the water environment capacity for the pollutants in each sub catchment was calculated by combining the water quality standard for the water function zone 6 w i α 86 4 q i c i s t c i u p 10 3 k v i c i s t where w i is the water environmental capacity of pollutants in sub catchment i kg d α is the inhomogeneity coefficient used for the correction of water environmental capacity q i represents the upstream input flow of sub catchment i m3 s c i u p is the pollutant concentration of upstream influent water mg l c i s t represents the water quality standard of the corresponding water function zone mg l k represents the pollutant degradation coefficient 1 d v i is the water body volume of sub catchment i combined with regional point source discharges the actual water environment capacity of the sub catchment is as follows 7 w i r w i p i p o i n t where w i r is the actual water environment capacity of sub catchment i kg d p i p o i n t is the pollution load discharged from the point source in sub catchment i pollutants were retained during conveyance in the river due to physical transport chemical transformation and the action of aquatic organisms therefore the retention factor r i was used as the indicator to estimate the efficiency of river transport expressed as 8 r i r i c h i i n r i c h i o u t r i c h i i n where r i c h i i n and r i c h i o u t are the river input and output quantities in the swat output file respectively thus the corrected nps pollutant flux in a particular river reach can be expressed as 9 p i n p s r i p i n p s where p i n p s represents the non point source pollutant flux at the downstream section of sub catchment i finally risk values r v i were calculated to quantify the impact of nps pollution discharges in the sub catchment on surrounding water bodies which were then used as the basis to classify the risk level table 1 10 r v i p i n p s w i r i 1 2 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the swat simulated runoff nh3 n and tp were compared with the observed values at the downstream hydrological water quality station shizhenjie in the le an river watershed in fig 2 a comparison of observed and simulated values of runoff and nps pollution quality for the two midstream and upstream stations namely xiangtun and sandu was described in figs s2 and s3 the model calibration period was 2008 2012 and the validation period was 2013 2015 the n s e coefficients p b i a s and m a p e for runoff during calibration and validation at the three hydrologic water quality sites ranged from 0 85 to 0 94 2 04 24 48 and 0 28 0 66 respectively the n s e coefficients and p b i a s for nh3 n and tp were lower than that of runoff with values in the range of 0 60 0 90 and 31 98 32 60 respectively m a p e values during calibration and validation of the contaminants were taken to be between 0 28 and 0 71 the results were comparable to the simulated results of swat in other watersheds zhai et al 2014 previous studies showed that the simulation results were acceptable when r 2 0 6 n s e 0 50 and m a p e values between 0 and 1 gassman et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 furthermore the results were satisfactory if the p b i a s of runoff and pollutants were within 25 and 70 respectively ma et al 2021 with the n s e coefficient 0 50 r 2 0 70 as well as p b i a s and m a p e values between reasonable ranges the le an river watershed model calibration results were considered satisfactory therefore the calibrated swat model can be used for the subsequent long series nutrient flux analysis 3 2 characteristics of nps nutrient loss in the watershed based on the simulation results the differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of nutrient loss and loss intensity in the le an river watershed were compared in 2014 fig 3 the intensity of tn loss in the whole watershed ranged from 0 033 kg ha and 6 367 kg ha with a monthly average value of 1 571 kg ha the tp loss intensity ranged from 0 002 kg ha to 1 256 kg ha with an average value of 0 263 kg ha as shown in fig 3 a the loss intensity of the tn and tp in the watershed in 2014 both peaked and valleyed in march and december respectively and the peaks were 4 05 and 4 77 times the monthly average value that indicated an apparent monthly variation in nutrient loss this phenomenon may be explained by the seasonal variation of rainfall in monsoon areas and the discrepancy in land use patterns previous studies have demonstrated that watershed land surface nps nutrient loss is associated with regional rainfall intensity frequency and land use cover patterns li et al 2022 tong and chen 2002 wang et al 2019 seasonal rainfall variability led to apparent changes in land use patterns and vegetation cover wu and lu 2019 which implied that there were also notable monthly variations in fertilizer use among watershed agroforestry systems furthermore a large proportion of nps nutrient loss comes from the long term use of chemical fertilizers ouyang et al 2018 it was evident that march was the planting season for early rice in the le an river watershed with the accompanying application of basal fertilizer meanwhile the precipitation amounted to 227 8 mm in march and the monthly frequency was 22 days including 8 days with 10 mm besides winter precipitation and agricultural activities were infrequent at the watershed therefore the loss intensity of tn and tp in the watershed unavoidably exhibited inter month disparity analyzing the spatial differences of nutrient loss in the watershed revealed that tn and tp loss was present in the southwest central northeast and the amount of tn and tp loss in the southwest was 92 and 87 of the sum of the loss in the central and northeast respectively likewise the nutrient loss varied widely among sub catchments fig 3 the sub catchments 22 and 23 located in the southwestern part of the watershed had high loss intensity of tn with 27 93 kg ha and 28 88 kg ha respectively the high intensity of tp loss was found in sub catchments 23 and 27 with intensity of 4 36 kg ha and 4 37 kg ha respectively it can be seen that the sub catchments with high intensity of nutrient loss were mainly concentrated in the middle and downstream areas of the watershed and the intensity of nps tn loss was much greater than that of nps tp a possible reason for this may be that the region included 73 33 of the cropland and 70 41 of the construction land in the watershed and the soil type was dominated by rice soils as known land use type and soil properties were the major influences on the spatial disparity of nutrient loss in the watershed djodjic et al 2021 ramos et al 2019 moreover nitrogen loss is significantly influenced by rainfall runoff and soil erosion while phosphorus loss is mainly related to soil erosion due to its chemical nature li et al 2021 xia et al 2013 previous studies have shown that nitrogen is more likely to be lost than phosphorus in plain hilly watersheds zeng et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 long term fertilizer use rural town life and unorganized livestock and poultry farming caused nps nitrogen and phosphorus pollution wu et al 2012 in addition the upstream areas were primarily hilly with dense vegetation which were also less prone to nutrient loss through soil erosion 3 3 risk levels distribution of nps nutrient loss in the watershed 3 3 1 annual scale the 2014 annual risk of nps tn and tp loss in the le an river watershed was assessed using the methodology for calculating risk levels the evaluation results were shown in fig 4 sub catchments no 14 17 and 20 22 were found to have higher exposure to nps tn loss likewise sub catchments no 20 22 were also areas with a higher risk of nps tp loss this suggested that the influence of nps tn and tp loss on the water quality of the nearby water body varied significantly between sub catchments fig 4 from fig 3 it can be seen that these higher risk sub catchments were not all areas with the highest intensity of tn and tp loss but all of them had the risk level of class 5 this finding can be explained by the different water quality standards and water environment capacity of the regional water function zones whose upstream water quality exceeded the standard resulting in a negative water environment capacity of tn and tp zhou et al 2017 it implied no exact positive correlation between the intensity of nps pollutant loss in the sub catchment and its risk category assessing the water pollution hazard caused by non point sources solely through the loss intensity was considered inadequate cheruvelil et al 2008 wang et al 2019 as in the work of shen et al on identifying priority management areas for nps in the daning river watershed shen et al 2015 the nps pollution risk should be considered in the context of water function zone differences 3 3 2 monthly scale following the seasonal rainfall runoff and the characteristics of nps nutrient loss in the watershed li et al 2022 five typical months january march june august and december were selected to explore the monthly variation in the risk of nps tn and tp loss at the rank level the risk values for tn and tp also showed significant differences between months and sub catchments clearly the risk of nps tn and tp loss was higher in march than in other months across the whole watershed fig 5 with the proportion of risk levels 4 and 5 at 85 18 and 77 77 respectively meanwhile the risk of nps tn and tp loss in the same sub catchment differed strongly between months fig 5 b and d which may be related to seasonal variations of nps nutrient pollution load and the water environment capacity so the loss risk values varied between months other than that 59 26 of the sub catchments exhibited much higher risk ratings in the dry season indicating that nps pollution occurred more easily in the dry season than in the flood season this result is at odds with most studies which have concluded that rainfall runoff in wet seasons drives up nps pollutant loss and thus leads to more severe water pollution badrzadeh et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 however fertilizer application in the le an river watershed generally starts in march along with a reduction in water environment capacity owing to decreased flows in the dry season thus making the non point source risk higher in the dry season than flood season there were apparent spatial differences at the sub catchment scale from the distribution of nps pollution risk values in march as in fig 5 e and f excluding cases such as sub catchments 22 and 18 where high nps nutrient pollution load with low or negative water environment capacity resulted in high risks it was found that relatively low nps nutrient pollution load coupled with low or negative water environment capacity also led to high loss risks e g sub catchments 15 and 19 correspondingly it also existed that high loss loads and the large water environment capacity made the relatively low nps pollutant loss risk e g sub catchment 27 the results of the study differ from the risk rating based solely on nps pollution load implying that the impact of water environment capacity on the nps risk assessment process is not negligible consequently a dynamic nps risk assessment approach based on water environment capacity was reasonable as it could be used not only to gain an accurate understanding of the variation in nps tn and tp risk with water environment capacity but also to distinguish differences in risk levels that were masked by similar nps pollutant loss volumes 3 4 risk category variance analysis and management implications the distribution of risk values was observed to differ between sub catchments figs 4 and 5 this discrepancy was caused by spatial differences in nps pollution load and pollutant water environment capacity upstream pollutant input concentrations and channel runoff both affect the water environment capacity bui and pham 2023 wei et al 2013 the redundancy analysis rda also indicated that runoff and upstream input concentrations were the primary reasons for spatial variation in the risk of nps nutrient loss fig 6 in addition the distribution of precipitation and land use also allows for different nps pollution load into a water body wang et al 2020b these driving factors create spatial and temporal heterogeneity in pollution risk making it more difficult for nps pollution governance and management unsurprisingly assessing the risk of nps pollution in watersheds is more efficient based on the water environment capacity first it emphasized the influence of nps pollution on the water quality in each sub catchment which distinguished from most risk assessment approaches focusing merely on land surface processes of nps pollution huang et al 2022 liu et al 2016 only by considering the impact of pollution load on water quality can the threat to the water environment and even the water ecology be identified secondly this method enables to make a preliminary determination of the risk level for nps pollution in the sub catchment based on upstream input concentrations during the pollutant water environment capacity calculation and to determine the regional risk relationship this is similar to the approach proposed by shen et al for the identification of pmas which combines upstream inputs and the water quality standard of the wfz to confirm whether upstream influxes influence regional pollution risks shen et al 2015 the difference is that we have further integrated the regional water environment capacity although the regional water functional zones may be the same the water environment capacity for pollutants is bound to be different due to upstream inputs and runoff our methodology takes such actual conditions of the water environment capacity into account in the risk assessment process and is more conducive to distinguishing risk differences that are masked by the same water function zones and similar nps pollution loads to enable targeted policy development 4 conclusion evaluating the impact of nps pollution load on nearby water bodies is crucial in watershed surface pollution management to our knowledge this study firstly proposes an nps pollution risk assessment method that combines water functional zones the environmental capacity of receiving water body and the time spatial distribution of pollution load for quantifying the impact of sub catchment pollution discharges on the nearby water body quality based on the nps nutrient loss modeled by swat the risk of nps pollution in the le an river watershed was assessed at annual and monthly scales in conjunction with the water environment capacity the results showed that the nps pollution risk was not positively correlated with the nps nutrient loss this is reflected in the spatial and temporal differences in risk values i e a high nps pollution load does not necessarily mean high pollution risk conversely a low nps nutrient pollution load does not represent a low regional risk sensitivity and the nps pollution risk was markedly influenced by the pollutant s water environment capacity the rda also indicated that runoff and upstream inputs both of which determine the water environment capacity were the main reasons for the spatial variation in risk therefore an nps risk assessment based on the water environment capacity would not only accurately understand the seasonal variation in pollution risk with the water environment capacity but also distinguish differences in risk rating that were masked by similar nps pollution loss quantity and the same water function zoning from the perspective of watershed management the results of this study can provide a reference for achieving precise management of nps pollution and effective protection of water quality in multi water functional zoning areas however this study did not consider inter annual variability in nps pollution risk and the distribution of pollution risk under extreme weather events which could be further optimized in subsequent studies credit authorship contribution statement yuanyuan li data curation methodology writing original draft hua wang

14721,the biogeochemical cycles of iron fe and manganese mn in lakes and reservoirs have predictable seasonal trends largely governed by stratification dynamics and redox conditions in the hypolimnion however short term i e sub weekly trends in fe and mn cycling are less well understood as most monitoring efforts focus on longer term i e monthly to yearly time scales the potential for elevated fe and mn to degrade water quality and impact ecosystem functioning coupled with increasing evidence for high spatiotemporal variability in other biogeochemical cycles necessitates a closer evaluation of the short term fe and mn dynamics in lakes and reservoirs we adapted a uv visible spectrophotometer coupled with a multiplexor pumping system and partial least squares regression plsr modeling to generate high spatiotemporal resolution predictions of fe and mn concentrations in a drinking water reservoir falling creek reservoir vinton va usa equipped with a hypolimnetic oxygenation hox system we quantified hourly fe and mn concentrations during two transitional periods reservoir turnover fall 2020 and hox initiation summer 2021 our sensor system successfully predicted mean fe and mn concentrations and trends ground truthed by grab sampling and laboratory analysis during fall turnover hypolimnetic fe and mn concentrations began to decrease more than two weeks before complete mixing of the reservoir with rapid equalization of epilimnetic and hypolimnetic fe and mn concentrations in less than 48 h after full water column mixing during the initiation of hox in summer 2021 fe and mn displayed distinctly different responses to oxygenation as indicated by the rapid oxidation of soluble fe but not soluble mn this study demonstrates that fe and mn concentrations are sensitive to changes in redox conditions induced by stratification and oxygenation although their responses to these changes differ we also show that high spatio temporal resolution predictions of fe and mn can improve drinking water monitoring programs and reservoir management practices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hypolimnetic oxygenation iron manganese spatiotemporal resolution

2022 1 introduction elevated levels of iron fe and manganese mn in lakes and reservoirs have negative consequences for ecosystem health and water quality increasing fe concentrations have been linked to the long term browning of lakes which has numerous significant ecological consequences kritzberg et al 2020 mn contamination of drinking water can pose risks to human health especially to children wasserman et al 2006 furthermore elevated concentrations of both metals negatively affect the taste odor and appearance of water and can damage water supply infrastructure through corrosion and deposition world health organization 2017 as a result the u s environmental protection agency usepa has established secondary standards for fe and mn concentrations in drinking water of 0 3 and 0 05 mg l respectively usepa 2021 as fe and mn are redox sensitive elements their abundance in aquatic systems is largely influenced by dissolved oxygen do concentrations hem 1972 davison 1993 the oxidation state of fe and mn in natural waters is dominated by two forms insoluble oxidized fe iii and mn iv and soluble reduced fe ii and mn ii davison 1993 in most aquatic systems under circumneutral ph this oxidation state is determined by the redox conditions at a given point in space and time under oxic conditions fe and mn are generally present as insoluble fe iii and mn iv solids in rocks and sediments however thermal stratification in lakes and reservoirs can create anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion and bottom sediments promoting the microbial reduction of fe and mn in sediments and the subsequent release of soluble reduced fe and mn into the water column lovely 1991 in such settings soluble fe and mn can accumulate in hypolimnetic waters throughout the stratified period mcmahon 1969 davison 1993 an increasingly used in situ approach for mitigating water quality issues in drinking water reservoirs is hypolimnetic oxygenation hox which creates oxic conditions in previously anoxic waters and creates a thicker aerobic zone in bottom sediments e g beutel and horne 1999 dent et al 2014 gerling et al 2014 for the case of metals by increasing oxygen availability in the hypolimnion hox operation hinders the release of soluble fe and mn into sediment pore waters slows upward diffusion into the water column and promotes fe and mn oxidation and precipitation in the hypolimnion preece et al 2019 hox systems have been shown to effectively reduce soluble fe and mn in the hypolimnion of drinking water reservoirs gantzer et al 2009 however removing soluble mn from the water column requires more sustained oxygen inputs due to its slower oxidation reaction kinetics bryant et al 2011 munger et al 2016 to optimize water treatment using hox systems it is essential for drinking water managers to understand both the short term sub weekly and long term monthly to yearly fe and mn dynamics in supply reservoirs although fe and mn cycling in temperate lakes and reservoirs has predictable seasonal trends dictated by thermal stratification there is a lack of research on short term fe and mn dynamics quantifying short term trends requires high frequency data which we define as having a temporal resolution of daily or shorter to our knowledge there is no standard definition for classifying data as high frequency or trends as short term thus we developed operational definitions based on the contrast with traditional monitoring frequencies which are typically weekly or longer e g marcé et al 2016 the paucity of previous research on fe and mn cycling at sub weekly scales represents a key knowledge gap given that biogeochemical process rates can fluctuate rapidly over hourly to daily time scales mcclain et al 2003 studies have identified diel signals in the cycles of numerous biogeochemical variables including fe and mn and many biological and chemical processes in aquatic environments operate on hourly to daily scales often with significant impacts on nutrient cycling and ecosystem productivity istvánovics et al 2004 nimick et al 2011 kurz et al 2013 additionally episodic hydrologic events which may be missed by traditional sampling methods can have pronounced effects on biogeochemical cycling dynamics e g marcé et al 2016 coraggio et al 2022 studies analyzing the efficacy of hox systems have observed substantial changes in fe and mn concentrations in response to changes in oxygenation dent et al 2014 munger et al 2019 for example dent et al 2014 found that total fe and mn concentrations decreased by 71 and 73 respectively after 8 h of oxygenation of a previously anoxic reservoir hypolimnion munger et al 2019 found that fe and mn sediment fluxes into the water column were 1 4 and 4 5 times higher respectively two weeks after the onset of hypolimnetic anoxia in a reservoir the dynamic behavior of fe and mn concentrations in response to both management and natural processes e g seasonal thermal stratification underscores the importance of quantifying these complex dynamics which could have substantial implications for drinking water management and water quality monitoring to date monitoring programs have been hindered by the coarse temporal frequency of months to seasons necessitated by traditional manual sampling and laboratory analysis techniques recent developments in sensor technology have enabled high frequency collection of some water quality variables in situ without the need for manual sampling and laboratory analysis porter et al 2009 rode et al 2016 kruse 2018 however most high frequency sensors are only capable of measuring a single variable at a time and typically have a low spatial resolution moreover numerous water quality variables including fe and mn lack instrumentation capable of unattended reagent less high frequency measurement to circumvent the limitations of current sensor technology spectrophotometers have been designed to measure water quality variables in situ at a high frequency using multi wavelength absorbance patterns in the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrum these sensors do not require chemical reagents and are capable of measuring multiple variables simultaneously to date uv vis spectrophotometers have been successfully used to measure chemical variables that have a strong correlation with known peaks in their absorbance spectra such as nitrate dissolved organic carbon and total suspended solids etheridge et al 2014 sakamoto et al 2009 additionally several studies have had success using them to measure concentrations of other biogeochemical variables without well defined spectral peaks such as fe total phosphorus soluble reactive phosphorus and dissolved silica birgand et al 2016 etheridge et al 2014 vaughan et al 2018 although fe and mn are not known to have well defined spectral peaks they absorb and scatter light at wavelengths across the uv vis spectrum and they can affect the absorbance of a water sample through complexation with organic molecules poulin et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 xiao et al 2013 therefore the covariance between the variable of interest e g fe or mn and the overall color matrix of the water the combination of multiple light sensitive proxies can be detected in the uv vis absorbance spectra and used to predict concentrations of the variable of interest with statistical algorithms birgand et al 2016 laboratory measured concentrations from manually collected samples are then subsequently used to develop predictive models that correlate known concentrations with absorbance spectra numerous algorithms exist for calibrating uv vis absorbance spectra to observed concentrations but the most commonly employed method is partial least squares regression plsr difoggio 2000 birgand et al 2016 vaughan et al 2018 plsr is well suited for modeling relationships within data that have a large number of highly correlated explanatory variables and relatively few observations such as multi wavelength spectral measurements wold et al 2001 previous studies have used in situ spectrophotometers coupled with plsr models to predict water quality variables in a variety of environments including streams lakes estuaries and oceans sakamoto et al 2009 avagyan et al 2014 etheridge et al 2014 birgand et al 2016 vaughan et al 2018 however to the best of our knowledge only one study birgand et al 2016 has evaluated the potential of this method to observe the high frequency dynamics of metals in stratified reservoirs in their study birgand et al 2016 designed a multiplexor sequential sampling system to pump water from different depths in a reservoir to one spectrophotometer this combined pumping system was developed because a single spectrophotometer cannot capture the rapid changes in elemental concentrations that occur along the strong thermal gradients with depth in lakes and reservoirs additionally the cost of in situ spectrophotometers 8000 25 000 usd as of 2023 prohibits the acquisition of multiple units needed to characterize spatial depth dynamics this system has proven to be able to characterize variable reservoir biogeochemical concentrations over both depth and time birgand et al 2016 in this study we used the system developed by birgand et al 2016 i e an in situ spectrophotometer coupled with a multiplexor pumping system and plsr modeling to predict high frequency fe and mn concentrations at nine depths in a seasonally stratified drinking water reservoir we then used this approach to observe the short term sub weekly variability of fe and mn concentrations during two distinct transitional periods reservoir turnover in fall 2020 and initiation of hox operation in summer 2021 the objectives of this study were to 1 predict high resolution fe and mn concentrations using spectral absorbance data coupled with plsr modeling 2 identify whether fe and mn concentrations exhibit temporal variability across spatial depth gradients and 3 quantify the effects of reservoir turnover and hypolimnetic oxygenation on fe and mn concentrations we provide a detailed overview of our method below for interested readers and show how it can be applied to provide high frequency fe and mn data at multiple depths in our focal reservoir 2 methods 2 1 study site field data were collected at falling creek reservoir fcr a small 0 12 km2 maximum depth 9 3 m dimictic reservoir located in vinton virginia usa fig 1 gerling et al 2014 fcr was constructed in 1898 and is managed as a drinking water reservoir by the western virginia water authority wvwa in roanoke va the summer stratified period at fcr typically lasts from may to october fcr is located in a forested catchment with one primary inflow and several smaller tributaries due to the underlying geology which consists of fe and mn rich rocks of the blue ridge and piedmont provinces woodward 1932 this region has elevated fe and mn concentrations in surface and groundwater chapman et al 2013 motivating the need for water quality interventions e g bryant et al 2011 fcr contains a hox system which can be activated and deactivated to control do concentrations in the hypolimnion without altering thermal stratification or water temperature fig 1 gerling et al 2014 the hox system at fcr was activated from 29 june 2020 until 2 december 2020 when it was turned off for the winter period it remained deactivated from 2 december 2020 until 11 june 2021 at which point it was turned back on and remained activated until the end of the study period on 21 june 2021 during its activation periods the hox added concentrated oxygen 95 purity at its maximum operation level 25 kg d to the hypolimnion gerling et al 2014 fcr is equipped with sensors that continuously monitor the physical chemical and meteorological conditions at the reservoir s deepest spot which was the primary sampling location in this study fig 1 do sensor data was collected using a ysi exo2 yellow springs oh deployed at 1 6 m and two in situ rdo pro x sensors fort collins co at 5 m and 9 m carey et al 2022b ten minute resolution temperature measurements were collected by in situ sensors deployed every meter from the surface to the reservoir sediments carey et al 2022b to quantify the intensity of reservoir thermal stratification during each deployment we calculated schmidt stability j m 2 idso 1973 using temperature measurements and bathymetric data from fcr carey et al 2022c as inputs to the r package rlakeanalyzer winslow et al 2019 meteorological variables were measured by a research grade campbell scientific meteorological station deployed on the dam of fcr carey et al 2022a 2 2 high frequency monitoring system we monitored high frequency light absorbance at multiple depths in fcr using a s can spectrolyser uv visible spectrophotometer s can messtechnik gmbh vienna austria this spectrophotometer was coupled with a multiplexor pumping system mux from multiplexô llc for technical details on the multiplexor pumping system and the sensor setup refer to birgand et al 2016 and figs s1 s3 the mux pumps water samples sequentially from multiple depths into a flow through cuvette where the uv vis absorbance spectra of the sample are measured by the spectrophotometer the system used in our study collected measurements of light absorbance every 2 5 nm wavelengths from 200 nm to 732 5 nm optical path length of 10 mm approximately at an hourly time step for six monitoring depths in the reservoir the mux system was used to collect high frequency data during two time periods reservoir turnover turnover deployment and the initiation of hox operation oxygen on deployment the turnover deployment captured the natural oxygenation and mixing processes that occurred during reservoir turnover and lasted from 16 october to 9 november 2020 in this study fall turnover was defined as the onset of reservoir mixing as determined by the first time when the temperature differential between 0 1 m and 9 m depths in the reservoir was 1 c after summer stratification following mcclure et al 2018 thomas et al 2020 and others which occurred on 2 november 2020 during this time period the hox system was on so the hypolimnion was oxic before turnover but the reservoir was thermally stratified the oxygen on deployment was conducted between 26 may and 21 june 2021 during that time the hox system was initiated on 11 june 2021 at 11 00 edt this deployment captured the engineered oxygenation and mixing processes resulting from the initiation of hox operation the hox system induced internal mixing within the hypolimnion but the overall thermal stratification of the reservoir was not affected prior to hox operation the reservoir was thermally stratified and the hypolimnion was anoxic do 1 mg l thus while the hox successfully added oxygen to the hypolimnion at its maximum capacity as indicated by the transformation from soluble to total fractions of metals during activation periods see results below we observed a limited increase in do concentrations due to high chemical oxygen demand which has been observed in many other waterbodies muller et al 2012 we took multiple steps to limit the influence of fouling of the internal components of the mux system due to precipitation of fe in contact with oxygen in the measuring cuvette between each pump cycle deionized water was flushed through the system at the end of each pump sequence one sample from each depth dilute hydrochloric acid 5 was automatically pumped through the system and allowed to sit in the flow through cuvette for approximately 2 min we also collected a reference measurement in air at the end of each cycle which was useful in determining the extent of fouling in addition we switched out the cuvette every two to three days and brought the fouled one back to the lab for the following cleaning routine soak in 50 hcl for 24 h rinse with di water soak in oxalic acid for 24 h and finally rinse with di water despite these efforts some fouling was still evident during certain time periods see figs s4 5 fouling was most pronounced in the lower wavelengths 200 250 nm see figs s6 7 and therefore we removed values for wavelengths less than 250 nm before fitting plsr models 2 3 sampling methods the method seeks to create a statistical relationship between light absorbing constituents the color matrix of the water with fe and mn concentrations to create the calibration dataset we sampled total and soluble fe and mn weekly throughout the stratified period at times and depths at which light absorbance data from the mux spectrometer couple were available for this study water samples were collected at the reservoir outtake depths of 0 1 1 6 3 8 m epilimnion 5 0 m metalimnion 6 2 8 0 and 9 0 m hypolimnion using a 4 l van dorn sampler thereby matching the mux sampling depths samples for soluble fe and mn were syringe filtered using 0 45 µm nylon filters both total and soluble metals samples were preserved with trace metal grade nitric acid to ph 2 samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms minimum reporting levels were 0 005 mg l fe and 0 0001 mg l mn the dataset including methods for sample collection and analysis can be found in schreiber et al 2022 to assess short term variability in metals concentrations and to calibrate and validate plsr models additional samples were collected every 2 4 h during two 24 hour campaigns the first campaign occurred on 16 17 october 2020 n 7 fig s8 the second campaign occurred on 10 11 june 2021 n 8 fig s9 all sampling data weekly and high frequency were used to calibrate plsr models calibration datasets were assessed for potential outliers using an ensemble approach implemented in the r package enpls xiao et al 2019 for each model an ensemble of 50 plsr sub models was generated using monte carlo resampling and the empirical predictive error distribution for each sample was used to identify outliers samples with a mean predictive error greater than three standard deviations from the mean predictive error for all samples or with a standard deviation greater than three times the mean standard deviation of all samples were considered potential outliers cao et al 2017 we took a conservative approach and did not eliminate all samples that met these criteria but rather only removed samples that were identified not only as outliers by the aforementioned method but also led to a deterioration of model fit showed signs of sampling analytical error or were collected during times of cuvette fouling after removing outliers the calibration datasets for the oxygen on deployment had approximately 30 more observations than for the turnover deployment fig 3 table 1 median fe and mn concentrations were substantially higher in the hypolimnion 6 2 8 0 and 9 0 m than the epilimnion 0 1 1 6 3 8 m during both deployments fig 3 2 4 predicting fe and mn concentrations from optical measurements using plsr we used plsr to compute predictions of total and soluble fe and mn concentrations based on the correlation between absorbance spectra and sampling data data analysis and qa qc was performed in the r programming environment r v 4 2 1 model building was conducted using the pls package mevik et al 2020 r core team 2022 the pls package has a built in function for determining the number of model components based on the root mean squared error of prediction rmsep using 10 fold cross validation mevik et al 2020 the algorithm randomly chooses a subset of the data to be withheld for validation while fitting the model to the rest of the data this is repeated across 10 random segments and the rmsep is computed for each component rmsep for each component is plotted against the number of components and the number of components included in the final plsr model is determined based on this curve generally as the number of components increases the rmsep curve decreases sharply until reaching an inflection point where it plateaus fig s18 to avoid overfitting we chose the number of components equal to this inflection point plus or minus one or the global minimum of the curve whichever resulted in the lowest number of components following etheridge et al 2014 birgand et al 2016 mevik et al 2020 furthermore it has been suggested that the number of components should not exceed 10 of the total number of observations used to calibrate the model mevik et al 2020 we followed this rule to the greatest extent possible in some cases the number of components slightly exceeded the 10 requirement but this only occurred when including an additional component would substantially decrease the rmsep determined by 10 fold cross validation while also improving the variance explained by the model given the sensitivity of the plsr method our approach was to optimize the tradeoff between model fit and predictive accuracy once the number of components was determined the model was fit to the observational data and predictions were made using the high frequency absorbance measurements in some cases plsr predicted slightly negative concentration values for the purposes of this analysis we considered negative values to have a value of 0 mg l for all variables unless stated otherwise separate plsr models were developed for each variable total fe soluble fe total mn and soluble mn and deployment based on the distinctly different chemical and biological characteristics between layers of the reservoir i e epilimnion and hypolimnion we found that the best fit was obtained when we used different models for the two layers in stratified reservoirs such as fcr fe and mn concentrations are higher in the hypolimnion than the epilimnion see fig 3 therefore we had an epilimnion model which included data from 0 1 1 6 and 3 8 m and a hypolimnion model which included data from 6 2 8 0 and 9 0 m table 1 although we also collected data from 5 0 m we did not include them in our analyses since this is at the transition between the two layers metalimnion see mcclure et al 2018 and thus not applicable to either layer we developed separate models for the turnover deployment and the oxygen on deployment in the end we had four separate models for each of the four variables total and soluble fe and mn resulting in 16 different models to assess the uncertainty of the predictions made using plsr we calculated nonparametric bootstrap predictive intervals following methods described by denham 1997 briefly a model was first fit to the available observational data y and absorbance spectra x using the predetermined number of components this model was used to make predictions e then the residuals of the original model were randomly sampled and added to y and e to obtain a new set of values for the dependent variable denoted here as y and new predictions denoted here as e a new model was fit to x and y and again used to make new predictions ê the prediction error was then calculated based on e ê this process was repeated 1000 times to obtain the bootstrapped error distribution g we then calculated the 0 05 and 0 95 quantiles of g which represented the 90 predictive intervals around the predictions from the original model denham 1997 model skill was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 from the linear regression between predicted and observed values as well as the root mean squared error of prediction rmsep for each model following wold et al 2001 and mevik et al 2020 all observational data including the spectrophotometer data are published in the environmental data initiative repository carey et al 2022a carey et al 2022b carey et al 2022c schreiber et al 2022 and hammond et al 2023 all code used to analyze the spectrophotometer data with plsr and generate the figures is available in the zenodo repository hammond 2022 3 results 3 1 routine fe and mn sampling trends weekly sampling at fcr showed levels of fe and mn in exceedance of the epa standards during the 2020 and 2021 stratified periods with maximum total fe and mn concentrations of 18 5 mg l and 2 2 mg l respectively fig 2 hypolimnetic concentrations of both metals generally increased throughout the summer stratified period of each year until reservoir fall turnover fig 2 following reservoir turnover concentrations of both metals remained 1 mg l until the following spring fig 2 3 2 plsr model performance a comparison of skill metrics among the 16 models revealed that plsr performed best for models calibrated with fe and mn concentrations greater than 0 03 mg l tables 1 s1 fig s10 model skill was also sensitive to the number of components included in each model for the turnover deployment the number of components included in the plsr models ranged from 3 to 5 9 14 of n for the oxygen on deployment 4 components were used for all plsr models 8 9 of n table 1 sample size was negatively correlated with r2 but positively correlated with rmsep fig s10 turnover deployment models explained a high proportion of the variability in total and soluble fe and mn concentrations r2 0 74 to 0 97 excluding hypolimnetic soluble fe which had a poor model fit r2 0 06 likely due to low concentrations median 0 02 mg l table 1 fig 3 in comparison oxygen on deployment models explained a lower proportion of the variability in total and soluble fe and mn concentrations r2 0 57 to 0 79 with one model of epilimnetic soluble mn having an r2 of 0 26 likely due to low concentrations median 0 01 mg l table 1 plsr model performance also varied between the hypolimnion and epilimnion for most models the epilimnetic plsr model had a higher r2 value than the corresponding hypolimnetic plsr model table 1 in most cases plsr predictions were within the range of concentration values in the calibration dataset figs 3 s11 12 but they did not capture some of the high magnitude fluctuations in the sampling data analysis of the fe and mn time series figs 4 d e and 5d e and calibration figs s11 12 suggests that inaccuracy in the models was largely attributed to calibration error for observations far from the mean concentration of the calibration data i e outliers additionally when predicting variables with low concentrations 0 03 mg l especially with the epilimnion models some predictions were in the negative range figs 4d e 5d e 3 3 reservoir turnover deployment 3 3 1 water temperature stratification and do concentrations do concentrations water temperature and schmidt stability varied considerably over the course of the turnover deployment fig 4a c prior to turnover do concentrations were strongly stratified by depth and exhibited large sub daily fluctuations in the epilimnion and metalimnion fig 4c hypolimnetic do concentrations were stable around 2 mg l during the pre turnover period due to the hox system operation fig 4c a sharp temperature gradient 4 7 c between the epilimnion and hypolimnion existed until approximately 3 days prior to turnover fig 4b however the water temperature profile equalized periodically between the metalimnion and hypolimnion prior to turnover indicating ephemeral periods of mixing between those layers fig 4b starting on 29 october 2020 the temperature gradient decreased progressively until the full water column temperature profile equalized on 02 november 2020 meeting our criteria for turnover 3 3 2 predicted fe and mn concentrations reservoir turnover had substantial impacts on fe and mn concentrations at the beginning of the deployment 16 october 2020 17 days prior to turnover both fe and mn displayed large differences in concentration between the epilimnion and hypolimnion fig 4d e the average total fe and total mn concentrations across all hypolimnetic depths 6 2 8 0 and 9 0 m were 3 73 mg l and 1 48 mg l across all epilimnetic depths 0 1 1 6 and 3 8 m they were 0 41 mg l and 0 14 mg l respectively fig 4d e substantial changes in epilimnetic concentrations were not observed until 24 h prior to turnover within that 24 hour period average epilimnetic total fe and total mn increased by 70 0 61 to 1 04 mg l and 66 0 29 to 0 48 mg l respectively in contrast to the epilimnion we observed declining total fe and mn concentrations in the hypolimnion prior to turnover fig 4d e between 16 october and 02 november 2020 hypolimnetic total fe and total mn concentrations declined at a rate of 0 13 and 0 11 mg l d respectively however there were also periods of fluctuations in total fe and total mn concentrations by as much as 1 mg l d fig 4d e in the 24 h prior to turnover average hypolimnetic total fe and total mn decreased by 45 2 09 to 1 14 mg l and 32 0 82 to 0 55 mg l respectively a strong concentration gradient between the epilimnion and hypolimnion remained for total fe and total mn until full reservoir turnover on 02 november 2020 after turnover water temperature and do rapidly equalized across the full water column coinciding with the rapid equalization of total fe and mn concentrations across the water column fig 4d e total fe and mn concentrations decreased and were less variable than during the pre turnover period fig 4d e the reservoir remained well mixed for 2 days but then shifting thermal gradients led to a temporary re stratification that began on 02 november 2020 and lasted until the end of the deployment on 09 november 2020 fig 4a b the re stratification of the reservoir was also evident in total fe and total mn concentrations fig 4d e 3 4 oxygen on deployment 3 4 1 water temperature stratification and do do concentrations water temperature and schmidt stability differed considerably between the two deployments fig 5 a c at the start of the oxygen on deployment 26 may 2021 16 days prior to hox activation epilimnetic do concentrations were high 5 15 mg l and exhibited a consistent decline throughout the deployment due to warm air temperatures fig s14 metalimnetic and hypolimnetic do concentrations were both approximately 0 mg l throughout the deployment the water temperature profile shows distinctly stratified layers in the reservoir prior to hox operation with a sharp temperature gradient throughout the epilimnion for the entire deployment and a slight temperature gradient in the hypolimnion fig 5b immediately following hox activation on 11 june 2021 the water temperature profile equalized across layers below 6 m depth indicating mixing within the hypolimnion due to hox activation fig 5b the water temperature profile in the epilimnion was unaffected by hox operation metalimnetic and hypolimnetic do concentrations did not increase above 0 mg l in the few days after activation of the hox system this is attributed to chemical oxygen demand in the hypolimnion resulting from elevated concentrations of reduced solutes e g fe ii and mn ii 3 4 2 predicted fe and mn concentrations at the beginning of the deployment the highest concentrations of total fe and mn were at the lowest depth 9 m and concentrations decreased upwards in the water column with a sharp decrease between the hypolimnion and epilimnion fig 5d e in the first 24 h of the deployment total fe and mn concentrations averaged across all epilimnetic depths were 0 43 and 0 03 mg l respectively while across the hypolimnetic depths they were 2 71 and 0 54 mg l respectively prior to hox operation both total fe and mn in the hypolimnion exhibited large sub daily fluctuations which resulted in concentration changes of up to 1 62 mg l hr and 0 19 mg l hr respectively fig 5d e these sub daily fluctuations were most pronounced at the lowest depth the spatial and temporal dynamics of fe and mn concentrations were significantly affected by hypolimnetic oxygenation prior to activation of the hox system on 11 june 2021 epilimnetic total fe and mn concentrations remained constant sd 0 07 mg l and 0 004 mg l respectively and had maximum concentrations of 0 63 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively hypolimnetic total fe and mn concentrations during this period were much more variable sd 1 85 mg l and 0 19 mg l respectively with maximum concentrations of 7 90 mg l and 1 08 mg l respectively shortly after hox activation total fe and mn concentrations equalized contemporaneously with the equalization of water temperature across the hypolimnetic depths indicating that this layer of the reservoir was well mixed with respect to fe and mn fig 5b 5d e in contrast differences in total fe and mn concentrations across the epilimnetic depths increased slightly after activation of the hox system approximately 6 h after turning on the hox system total fe and mn at 9 m depth declined by approximately 2 5 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively fig 5d e concentrations of total fe and mn at all hypolimnetic depths subsequently increased over the next 24 h before eventually stabilizing over the following 24 h at concentrations of 1 5 3 5 mg l and 0 5 0 75 mg l respectively for the remainder of the deployment total fe and mn concentrations remained equal across all hypolimnetic depths and exhibited less variability fig 5d e 3 5 predicted fe and mn soluble to total ratios the ratio of predicted soluble to total fe sfe tfe and mn smn tmn was calculated to assess redox transformations we observed distinct changes in these ratios over the course of both deployments most notably in the hypolimnion fig 6 during the turnover deployment the hypolimnion was maintained at oxic conditions pre turnover due to hox and post turnover due to mixing as expected hypolimnetic sfe tfe was approximately 0 during this entire deployment indicating that all fe in the hypolimnion was in the particulate fraction soluble fe particulate fe total fe in contrast hypolimnetic smn tmn was approximately 1 at the beginning of the deployment indicating that all mn was in the soluble fraction however in the week prior to turnover hypolimnetic smn tmn oscillated between 0 5 and 1 following turnover smn tmn remained greater than 0 75 until the end of the deployment at the beginning of the oxygen on deployment sfe tfe differed greatly with depth in the hypolimnion with ratios greater than 0 8 at 9 m depth and ratios close to 0 at 6 2 m and 8 m depths fig 6c d between the beginning of the deployment and hox activation on 11 june 2021 the sfe tfe at 6 2 m and 8 m increased continuously to approximately the same level as 9 m fig 6c d just before the initiation of hox operation the sfe tfe at all hypolimnion depths was 0 75 indicating that most of the fe in the hypolimnion was in the soluble fraction however immediately after turning the hox system on the sfe tfe in the hypolimnion decreased steadily in the 48 hour period after hox activation the sfe tfe in the hypolimnion declined to less than 0 25 until the end of the experimental period fig 6c d indicating oxidation processes in contrast to fe smn tmn in the hypolimnion was 0 90 for the entire deployment we did not observe a significant effect of hox operation on smn tmn 0 99 pre hox 0 97 post hox 4 discussion 4 1 plsr modeling of high frequency absorbance spectra can predict fe and mn concentrations using uv visible absorbance spectra and plsr modeling we made hourly predictions of fe and mn concentrations at 6 depths in our study reservoir our results indicate that this method can successfully predict fe and mn concentrations with some limitations discussed below based on their covariability with uv vis absorbance spectra despite the paucity of clearly defined absorbance peaks for these elements plsr models were able to explain a high proportion of the variability in the sampling data see r2 values in table 1 and predictions agreed with expected trends in fe and mn concentrations for example the rapid decline in sfe tfe following the onset of hox operation fig 6c matches expectations based on the rapid oxidation kinetics of fe ii in the presence of oxygen davison and seed 1983 previous studies have also demonstrated substantial decreases in soluble fe following short periods of hox dent et al 2014 munger et al 2016 krueger et al 2020 based on model skill metrics i e r2 and rmsep and visual inspection of the predicted time series accurate predictions of fe and mn concentrations using this method are influenced by numerous factors including the range and variance of concentrations in the calibration dataset the sample size used for calibration the number of outliers in the calibration dataset the number of components in the plsr model and the inherent predictability of each variable at a particular site i e the strength of correlation with the uv vis absorbance spectra our results suggest that our methodology may be most appropriate for measuring elevated concentrations of fe and mn 0 1 mg l this result agrees with vaughan et al 2018 who suggested that the application of this method to predict riverine total phosphorus tp concentrations was best for sites with elevated tp 0 1 mg l concentrations in our study plsr models fit to data with concentrations of fe and mn 0 03 mg l generally did not perform well for example soluble fe during the turnover deployment had median concentrations of 0 02 mg l in the hypolimnion fig 3 and table s1 accordingly the plsr models for hypolimnetic soluble fe had the lowest r2 0 06 and highest rmsep relative to median calibration concentration out of any model for the turnover deployment tables 1 s1 our plsr models were also sensitive to the range and variance of sampling data used for calibration preliminary model testing revealed that plsr models were hindered by the distinct water chemistry between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic depths fe and mn mean differences 1 3 mg l and 0 8 mg l respectively see fig 3 and therefore models were generated separately for each reservoir layer this conforms with findings of previous studies using in situ uv vis spectrophotometers and plsr in waterbodies which all achieved higher accuracy with site specific models avagyan et al 2014 vaughan et al 2018 etheridge et al 2014 however when comparing pairs of plsr models i e the same variable depth combination between the two deployments the models fit to data with a higher standard deviation had higher r2 values with the sole exception of hypolimnetic total fe tables 1 and s1 these results suggest that there is a tradeoff between capturing the maximum variability in observed concentrations and the limitations imposed by the degree of covariability between the uv vis absorbance spectra and the variable of interest also observed by avagyan et al 2014 and allen 2021 to achieve an accurate predictive model grouping data based on the spatial and temporal context of measurement achieved a better fitting model while still maximizing the variability captured in the calibration data birgand et al 2016 used a similar approach for making predictions of soluble fe concentrations in fcr after the activation of a hox system they obtained a slightly better model fit indicated by an r2 value of 0 94 compared to our r2 values of 0 79 and 0 75 epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively for the oxygen on deployment we used calibration sample sizes of 48 and 45 epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively while birgand et al 2016 used 27 however they used 5 components in their plsr model whereas we used 4 components thus the higher r2 value for their model may be attributed to a higher ratio of components to sample size 18 compared to our study 8 9 which has been shown in other applications of plsr mevik et al 2020 etheridge et al 2014 birgand et al 2016 our results captured sub weekly patterns in fe and mn dynamics in fcr but the plsr predicted time series of fe and mn concentrations was not able to adequately capture some of the high magnitude sub daily fluctuations that were observed in the sampling data figs 4 and 6 this is likely due to varying plsr model skill which is related to the sample size and distribution of data used for calibration the number of plsr model components and the inherent predictability of each variable therefore it follows that the strength of correlation between the uv vis absorbance spectra and fe mn concentrations plays a strong role in determining the limits to the temporal resolution this relationship can be refined through the methodological suggestions outlined below but ultimately depends upon the spectral properties of the study system there are several limitations of this method that should be addressed in future research in our reservoir the cuvette fitted on the spectrophotometer experienced fouling likely due to fe and mn in the hypolimnion that oxidized and precipitated on the cuvette walls upon exposure to oxygen despite our efforts to limit fouling see methods there was still a fouling signal detected in several periods of our time series although fouling occurred the plsr models still provided a remarkably good numerical correction for this fouling signal for future work we recommend collection of additional calibration samples obtained at regular intervals between servicing dates as this will give a chance for the plsr model to correct for the timing and kinetics of the optics fouling and may thus lower uncertainties we also found that truncating the uv vis absorbance spectra used for calibration to only include wavelengths greater than 250 nm substantially improved the model skill and diminished spikes in the time series of predictions that corresponded to periods of heavy fouling figs s6 and s7 finally we focused this study on high frequency measurements over a short term day to week and not on long term month to year predictions additional work would need to be done with longer deployments and calibration data to establish if longer term predictions can be made 4 2 fe and mn concentrations change gradually in response to weakening stratification and rapidly in response to fall turnover trends in predicted fe and mn concentrations shed light on the changes that occurred in the reservoir before and after turnover hypolimnetic concentrations of fe and mn began declining 17 and 9 days prior to turnover respectively and shorter periods of more rapid concentration fluctuations were superimposed upon these patterns of decline fig 4d e combined these results suggest that turnover at least in our study reservoir is not a discrete event but rather a process occurring over an extended time period mcmahon 1969 measured a similar decrease in soluble fe using daily samples for nine days across spring mixing in a dimictic lake soluble fe concentrations decreased by more than one order of magnitude 5 days prior to full circulation mcmahon 1969 did not offer any interpretation of this phenomenon simply stating that the changes in soluble fe were concurrent with vernal circulation similar trends have also been observed in other parameters of biogeochemical relevance for example kankaala et al 2007 found that the majority of ch4 in the hypolimnion of a lake was microbially oxidized at the oxycline boundary during a month long period of weakening stratification before complete mixing occurred resulting in lower effluxes of ch4 to the atmosphere during turnover predicted fe and mn concentration data can be compared to other time series data to infer mechanisms behind the declining fe and mn concentrations prior to turnover based on trends in schmidt stability and water temperature fig 4a b reservoir stratification was weakening for a 9 day period prior to full turnover in response to daily and hourly shifts in meteorological conditions including air temperature and wind speed fig s13 mixing between the hypolimnion and metalimnion as indicated by the homogenization of water temperature between these layers occurred periodically throughout the deployment with an increasing frequency as turnover approached figs 4a b s15 these ephemeral periods of mixing between the hypolimnion and metalimnion likely led to exchange of fe and mn between layers which suggests that hydrodynamic processes occurring on hourly to daily time scales may have a substantial influence of fe and mn cycling however without fe and mn concentration data at a high spatiotemporal resolution these patterns would not be observed the flexibility of using a multiplexor spectrophotometer system with a customized prediction algorithm e g site specific plsr models allows for the quantification of high resolution elemental stoichiometry by making predictions of both the soluble and total fractions of fe and mn during the turnover deployment fe was predominantly composed of the total fraction whereas mn was largely composed of the soluble fraction until approximately one week before turnover at which time the smn tmn ratio began to decline fig 6b this coincided with the onset of declining total mn concentrations that continued until turnover excluding a 2 day period from 28 october to 30 october 2020 when total mn concentrations temporarily increased fig 4e the shift to declining smn tmn and total mn concentrations also coincided with increased frequency of mixing between the metalimnion and hypolimnion and declining stratification intensity figs 4a b and 6b these trends suggest that declining total mn concentrations in the pre turnover period were the result of increased oxidation of mn ii perhaps due to the exposure of mn ii in the hypolimnion to mn oxidizing microbes that inhabit the metalimnion as demonstrated by a previous study at fcr showing that the presence of mn oxidizing microorganisms can substantially increase mn oxidation rates munger et al 2016 4 3 hypolimnetic oxygenation causes rapid oxidation of fe with lesser impact on mn the mux spectrophotometer system enabled us to observe fe and mn concentration changes in response to hypolimnetic oxygenation at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution fe and mn concentrations in the hypolimnion both spiked in the 48 h following oxygenation then declined fig 5d e however fe concentrations decreased to levels lower than they were prior to oxygenation especially at the lowest depth whereas mn concentrations declined to approximately the same levels prior to oxygenation fig 5d e these results suggest that the hox system physically mixed the hypolimnion with respect to both metals as total fe and total mn concentrations quickly converged across hypolimnetic depths after turning on the hox system fig 5d e the physical mixing induced by the hox system appeared to affect fe and mn similarly suggesting that the spike in total fe and mn immediately following hox activation was a result of increased mixing and or entrainment of particulates in the hypolimnion due to stirring of the bottom sediments the convergence of fe and mn concentrations across hypolimnetic depths has previously been observed in response to hox activation gerling et al 2014 but results from this study reveal that this can occur in less than 24 h and may subsequently be followed by an ephemeral spike in total fe and mn concentrations concentrations of total fe and mn displayed more short term variability prior to hox activation than they did post activation this was especially pronounced at the lowest depth 9m where concentrations fluctuated significantly over a period of less than 24 h fig 5d e given that the sfe tfe ratio in the upper and middle hypolimnion 6 2 m and 8 m steadily increased during the pre hox period fig 6c likely due to diffusion of soluble fe out of the lower hypolimnion the rapid fluctuations in total fe in the lower hypolimnion may have been attributed to shifting diffusion gradients however similar patterns in short term variability were observed in fe and mn despite the fact that mn was predominantly in the soluble phase for the entire deployment suggesting that diffusion of soluble mn out of the lower hypolimnion was not responsible for the pre hox rapid fluctuations observed at 9 m the change in redox conditions caused by adding do to the hypolimnion had a much more pronounced effect on fe than mn as has been observed in other studies e g gantzer et al 2009 the contrasting responses of fe and mn to oxygenation can be seen most clearly in the resulting changes in soluble total ratios fig 6 the sfe tfe ratio in the hypolimnion exhibited a nearly constant linear decline in the 48 h post oxygenation and remained below 0 25 for the remainder of the deployment this indicates that soluble fe in the water column was rapidly oxidized by the hox system even though there was no measurable increase in hypolimnetic do this is further supported by the fact that the mean hypolimnetic total fe concentration was consistently lower after hox operation began than it was previously the observed trends in sfe tfe ratios agree with previous research on the effects of hox systems on fe in lakes and reservoirs for example dent et al 2014 found that sfe tfe declined to 0 58 after 8 h of hypolimnetic oxygenation in our study it took approximately twice as long 16 h for sfe tfe to reach 0 58 however the fe concentrations in dent et al 2014 were lower 0 17 2 88 mg l than those in our study 0 31 7 42 mg l in contrast to fe the smn tmn ratio in the hypolimnion displayed only a very slight response approximately 2 decrease to hox activation demonstrating that hypolimnetic oxygenation did not result in significant oxidation of mn at the timescale of our deployments our results agree with those from dent et al 2014 who found that mn was still 100 in the soluble phase 8 h after oxygenation furthermore previous studies at fcr have also showed that soluble mn does not respond significantly to oxygenation alone and that other factors such as microbially mediated oxidation reservoir ph range 6 4 7 1 observed in the hypolimnion during our study sorption and dilution from physical mixing are more important variables impacting hypolimnetic soluble mn than oxygenation munger et al 2016 krueger et al 2020 5 conclusions results from this study demonstrate that coupling a spectrophotometer with a multiplexed pumping system enabled high frequency monitoring of fe and mn at multiple depths in our study reservoir providing a unique ability to observe hour resolution biogeochemical dynamics in a freshwater ecosystem although there are limitations to the method our findings confirm that it is possible to correlate the color matrix light absorbance rich data of water to parameters not known to absorb light using a site specific statistical calibration plsr to unveil processes tightly coupled in space and in time our results underscore the importance of implementing robust and consistent methodologies for obtaining calibration concentrations choosing the number of components in plsr models and quantifying the uncertainty around predictions the high spatiotemporal resolution predictions provide novel insights into fe and mn dynamics that could improve aquatic monitoring programs and reservoir management practices first we demonstrated that fe and mn concentrations can fluctuate significantly on time scales much shorter than those employed by most traditional monitoring programs for example sub daily fluctuations of total fe and mn during the oxygen on deployment resulted in concentration changes of up to 1 62 mg l hr and 0 19 mg l hr respectively considering that the secondary drinking water standards for fe and mn are 0 3 and 0 05 mg l respectively sub daily concentration changes of this magnitude are critical for water quality management second we observed an increase in total hypolimnetic fe and mn in response to the re stratification of our study reservoir two days after turnover which contradicts the common assumption that metals concentrations equalize and decrease during the mixed period following turnover last our results offer new insights on the rapid response of fe to hypolimnetic oxygenation within hours of activating the system the soluble to total fe ratio indicated oxidation of fe even though there was no measurable increase in do this study emphasizes

14721,the biogeochemical cycles of iron fe and manganese mn in lakes and reservoirs have predictable seasonal trends largely governed by stratification dynamics and redox conditions in the hypolimnion however short term i e sub weekly trends in fe and mn cycling are less well understood as most monitoring efforts focus on longer term i e monthly to yearly time scales the potential for elevated fe and mn to degrade water quality and impact ecosystem functioning coupled with increasing evidence for high spatiotemporal variability in other biogeochemical cycles necessitates a closer evaluation of the short term fe and mn dynamics in lakes and reservoirs we adapted a uv visible spectrophotometer coupled with a multiplexor pumping system and partial least squares regression plsr modeling to generate high spatiotemporal resolution predictions of fe and mn concentrations in a drinking water reservoir falling creek reservoir vinton va usa equipped with a hypolimnetic oxygenation hox system we quantified hourly fe and mn concentrations during two transitional periods reservoir turnover fall 2020 and hox initiation summer 2021 our sensor system successfully predicted mean fe and mn concentrations and trends ground truthed by grab sampling and laboratory analysis during fall turnover hypolimnetic fe and mn concentrations began to decrease more than two weeks before complete mixing of the reservoir with rapid equalization of epilimnetic and hypolimnetic fe and mn concentrations in less than 48 h after full water column mixing during the initiation of hox in summer 2021 fe and mn displayed distinctly different responses to oxygenation as indicated by the rapid oxidation of soluble fe but not soluble mn this study demonstrates that fe and mn concentrations are sensitive to changes in redox conditions induced by stratification and oxygenation although their responses to these changes differ we also show that high spatio temporal resolution predictions of fe and mn can improve drinking water monitoring programs and reservoir management practices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hypolimnetic oxygenation iron manganese spatiotemporal resolution

2022 1 introduction elevated levels of iron fe and manganese mn in lakes and reservoirs have negative consequences for ecosystem health and water quality increasing fe concentrations have been linked to the long term browning of lakes which has numerous significant ecological consequences kritzberg et al 2020 mn contamination of drinking water can pose risks to human health especially to children wasserman et al 2006 furthermore elevated concentrations of both metals negatively affect the taste odor and appearance of water and can damage water supply infrastructure through corrosion and deposition world health organization 2017 as a result the u s environmental protection agency usepa has established secondary standards for fe and mn concentrations in drinking water of 0 3 and 0 05 mg l respectively usepa 2021 as fe and mn are redox sensitive elements their abundance in aquatic systems is largely influenced by dissolved oxygen do concentrations hem 1972 davison 1993 the oxidation state of fe and mn in natural waters is dominated by two forms insoluble oxidized fe iii and mn iv and soluble reduced fe ii and mn ii davison 1993 in most aquatic systems under circumneutral ph this oxidation state is determined by the redox conditions at a given point in space and time under oxic conditions fe and mn are generally present as insoluble fe iii and mn iv solids in rocks and sediments however thermal stratification in lakes and reservoirs can create anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion and bottom sediments promoting the microbial reduction of fe and mn in sediments and the subsequent release of soluble reduced fe and mn into the water column lovely 1991 in such settings soluble fe and mn can accumulate in hypolimnetic waters throughout the stratified period mcmahon 1969 davison 1993 an increasingly used in situ approach for mitigating water quality issues in drinking water reservoirs is hypolimnetic oxygenation hox which creates oxic conditions in previously anoxic waters and creates a thicker aerobic zone in bottom sediments e g beutel and horne 1999 dent et al 2014 gerling et al 2014 for the case of metals by increasing oxygen availability in the hypolimnion hox operation hinders the release of soluble fe and mn into sediment pore waters slows upward diffusion into the water column and promotes fe and mn oxidation and precipitation in the hypolimnion preece et al 2019 hox systems have been shown to effectively reduce soluble fe and mn in the hypolimnion of drinking water reservoirs gantzer et al 2009 however removing soluble mn from the water column requires more sustained oxygen inputs due to its slower oxidation reaction kinetics bryant et al 2011 munger et al 2016 to optimize water treatment using hox systems it is essential for drinking water managers to understand both the short term sub weekly and long term monthly to yearly fe and mn dynamics in supply reservoirs although fe and mn cycling in temperate lakes and reservoirs has predictable seasonal trends dictated by thermal stratification there is a lack of research on short term fe and mn dynamics quantifying short term trends requires high frequency data which we define as having a temporal resolution of daily or shorter to our knowledge there is no standard definition for classifying data as high frequency or trends as short term thus we developed operational definitions based on the contrast with traditional monitoring frequencies which are typically weekly or longer e g marcé et al 2016 the paucity of previous research on fe and mn cycling at sub weekly scales represents a key knowledge gap given that biogeochemical process rates can fluctuate rapidly over hourly to daily time scales mcclain et al 2003 studies have identified diel signals in the cycles of numerous biogeochemical variables including fe and mn and many biological and chemical processes in aquatic environments operate on hourly to daily scales often with significant impacts on nutrient cycling and ecosystem productivity istvánovics et al 2004 nimick et al 2011 kurz et al 2013 additionally episodic hydrologic events which may be missed by traditional sampling methods can have pronounced effects on biogeochemical cycling dynamics e g marcé et al 2016 coraggio et al 2022 studies analyzing the efficacy of hox systems have observed substantial changes in fe and mn concentrations in response to changes in oxygenation dent et al 2014 munger et al 2019 for example dent et al 2014 found that total fe and mn concentrations decreased by 71 and 73 respectively after 8 h of oxygenation of a previously anoxic reservoir hypolimnion munger et al 2019 found that fe and mn sediment fluxes into the water column were 1 4 and 4 5 times higher respectively two weeks after the onset of hypolimnetic anoxia in a reservoir the dynamic behavior of fe and mn concentrations in response to both management and natural processes e g seasonal thermal stratification underscores the importance of quantifying these complex dynamics which could have substantial implications for drinking water management and water quality monitoring to date monitoring programs have been hindered by the coarse temporal frequency of months to seasons necessitated by traditional manual sampling and laboratory analysis techniques recent developments in sensor technology have enabled high frequency collection of some water quality variables in situ without the need for manual sampling and laboratory analysis porter et al 2009 rode et al 2016 kruse 2018 however most high frequency sensors are only capable of measuring a single variable at a time and typically have a low spatial resolution moreover numerous water quality variables including fe and mn lack instrumentation capable of unattended reagent less high frequency measurement to circumvent the limitations of current sensor technology spectrophotometers have been designed to measure water quality variables in situ at a high frequency using multi wavelength absorbance patterns in the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrum these sensors do not require chemical reagents and are capable of measuring multiple variables simultaneously to date uv vis spectrophotometers have been successfully used to measure chemical variables that have a strong correlation with known peaks in their absorbance spectra such as nitrate dissolved organic carbon and total suspended solids etheridge et al 2014 sakamoto et al 2009 additionally several studies have had success using them to measure concentrations of other biogeochemical variables without well defined spectral peaks such as fe total phosphorus soluble reactive phosphorus and dissolved silica birgand et al 2016 etheridge et al 2014 vaughan et al 2018 although fe and mn are not known to have well defined spectral peaks they absorb and scatter light at wavelengths across the uv vis spectrum and they can affect the absorbance of a water sample through complexation with organic molecules poulin et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 xiao et al 2013 therefore the covariance between the variable of interest e g fe or mn and the overall color matrix of the water the combination of multiple light sensitive proxies can be detected in the uv vis absorbance spectra and used to predict concentrations of the variable of interest with statistical algorithms birgand et al 2016 laboratory measured concentrations from manually collected samples are then subsequently used to develop predictive models that correlate known concentrations with absorbance spectra numerous algorithms exist for calibrating uv vis absorbance spectra to observed concentrations but the most commonly employed method is partial least squares regression plsr difoggio 2000 birgand et al 2016 vaughan et al 2018 plsr is well suited for modeling relationships within data that have a large number of highly correlated explanatory variables and relatively few observations such as multi wavelength spectral measurements wold et al 2001 previous studies have used in situ spectrophotometers coupled with plsr models to predict water quality variables in a variety of environments including streams lakes estuaries and oceans sakamoto et al 2009 avagyan et al 2014 etheridge et al 2014 birgand et al 2016 vaughan et al 2018 however to the best of our knowledge only one study birgand et al 2016 has evaluated the potential of this method to observe the high frequency dynamics of metals in stratified reservoirs in their study birgand et al 2016 designed a multiplexor sequential sampling system to pump water from different depths in a reservoir to one spectrophotometer this combined pumping system was developed because a single spectrophotometer cannot capture the rapid changes in elemental concentrations that occur along the strong thermal gradients with depth in lakes and reservoirs additionally the cost of in situ spectrophotometers 8000 25 000 usd as of 2023 prohibits the acquisition of multiple units needed to characterize spatial depth dynamics this system has proven to be able to characterize variable reservoir biogeochemical concentrations over both depth and time birgand et al 2016 in this study we used the system developed by birgand et al 2016 i e an in situ spectrophotometer coupled with a multiplexor pumping system and plsr modeling to predict high frequency fe and mn concentrations at nine depths in a seasonally stratified drinking water reservoir we then used this approach to observe the short term sub weekly variability of fe and mn concentrations during two distinct transitional periods reservoir turnover in fall 2020 and initiation of hox operation in summer 2021 the objectives of this study were to 1 predict high resolution fe and mn concentrations using spectral absorbance data coupled with plsr modeling 2 identify whether fe and mn concentrations exhibit temporal variability across spatial depth gradients and 3 quantify the effects of reservoir turnover and hypolimnetic oxygenation on fe and mn concentrations we provide a detailed overview of our method below for interested readers and show how it can be applied to provide high frequency fe and mn data at multiple depths in our focal reservoir 2 methods 2 1 study site field data were collected at falling creek reservoir fcr a small 0 12 km2 maximum depth 9 3 m dimictic reservoir located in vinton virginia usa fig 1 gerling et al 2014 fcr was constructed in 1898 and is managed as a drinking water reservoir by the western virginia water authority wvwa in roanoke va the summer stratified period at fcr typically lasts from may to october fcr is located in a forested catchment with one primary inflow and several smaller tributaries due to the underlying geology which consists of fe and mn rich rocks of the blue ridge and piedmont provinces woodward 1932 this region has elevated fe and mn concentrations in surface and groundwater chapman et al 2013 motivating the need for water quality interventions e g bryant et al 2011 fcr contains a hox system which can be activated and deactivated to control do concentrations in the hypolimnion without altering thermal stratification or water temperature fig 1 gerling et al 2014 the hox system at fcr was activated from 29 june 2020 until 2 december 2020 when it was turned off for the winter period it remained deactivated from 2 december 2020 until 11 june 2021 at which point it was turned back on and remained activated until the end of the study period on 21 june 2021 during its activation periods the hox added concentrated oxygen 95 purity at its maximum operation level 25 kg d to the hypolimnion gerling et al 2014 fcr is equipped with sensors that continuously monitor the physical chemical and meteorological conditions at the reservoir s deepest spot which was the primary sampling location in this study fig 1 do sensor data was collected using a ysi exo2 yellow springs oh deployed at 1 6 m and two in situ rdo pro x sensors fort collins co at 5 m and 9 m carey et al 2022b ten minute resolution temperature measurements were collected by in situ sensors deployed every meter from the surface to the reservoir sediments carey et al 2022b to quantify the intensity of reservoir thermal stratification during each deployment we calculated schmidt stability j m 2 idso 1973 using temperature measurements and bathymetric data from fcr carey et al 2022c as inputs to the r package rlakeanalyzer winslow et al 2019 meteorological variables were measured by a research grade campbell scientific meteorological station deployed on the dam of fcr carey et al 2022a 2 2 high frequency monitoring system we monitored high frequency light absorbance at multiple depths in fcr using a s can spectrolyser uv visible spectrophotometer s can messtechnik gmbh vienna austria this spectrophotometer was coupled with a multiplexor pumping system mux from multiplexô llc for technical details on the multiplexor pumping system and the sensor setup refer to birgand et al 2016 and figs s1 s3 the mux pumps water samples sequentially from multiple depths into a flow through cuvette where the uv vis absorbance spectra of the sample are measured by the spectrophotometer the system used in our study collected measurements of light absorbance every 2 5 nm wavelengths from 200 nm to 732 5 nm optical path length of 10 mm approximately at an hourly time step for six monitoring depths in the reservoir the mux system was used to collect high frequency data during two time periods reservoir turnover turnover deployment and the initiation of hox operation oxygen on deployment the turnover deployment captured the natural oxygenation and mixing processes that occurred during reservoir turnover and lasted from 16 october to 9 november 2020 in this study fall turnover was defined as the onset of reservoir mixing as determined by the first time when the temperature differential between 0 1 m and 9 m depths in the reservoir was 1 c after summer stratification following mcclure et al 2018 thomas et al 2020 and others which occurred on 2 november 2020 during this time period the hox system was on so the hypolimnion was oxic before turnover but the reservoir was thermally stratified the oxygen on deployment was conducted between 26 may and 21 june 2021 during that time the hox system was initiated on 11 june 2021 at 11 00 edt this deployment captured the engineered oxygenation and mixing processes resulting from the initiation of hox operation the hox system induced internal mixing within the hypolimnion but the overall thermal stratification of the reservoir was not affected prior to hox operation the reservoir was thermally stratified and the hypolimnion was anoxic do 1 mg l thus while the hox successfully added oxygen to the hypolimnion at its maximum capacity as indicated by the transformation from soluble to total fractions of metals during activation periods see results below we observed a limited increase in do concentrations due to high chemical oxygen demand which has been observed in many other waterbodies muller et al 2012 we took multiple steps to limit the influence of fouling of the internal components of the mux system due to precipitation of fe in contact with oxygen in the measuring cuvette between each pump cycle deionized water was flushed through the system at the end of each pump sequence one sample from each depth dilute hydrochloric acid 5 was automatically pumped through the system and allowed to sit in the flow through cuvette for approximately 2 min we also collected a reference measurement in air at the end of each cycle which was useful in determining the extent of fouling in addition we switched out the cuvette every two to three days and brought the fouled one back to the lab for the following cleaning routine soak in 50 hcl for 24 h rinse with di water soak in oxalic acid for 24 h and finally rinse with di water despite these efforts some fouling was still evident during certain time periods see figs s4 5 fouling was most pronounced in the lower wavelengths 200 250 nm see figs s6 7 and therefore we removed values for wavelengths less than 250 nm before fitting plsr models 2 3 sampling methods the method seeks to create a statistical relationship between light absorbing constituents the color matrix of the water with fe and mn concentrations to create the calibration dataset we sampled total and soluble fe and mn weekly throughout the stratified period at times and depths at which light absorbance data from the mux spectrometer couple were available for this study water samples were collected at the reservoir outtake depths of 0 1 1 6 3 8 m epilimnion 5 0 m metalimnion 6 2 8 0 and 9 0 m hypolimnion using a 4 l van dorn sampler thereby matching the mux sampling depths samples for soluble fe and mn were syringe filtered using 0 45 µm nylon filters both total and soluble metals samples were preserved with trace metal grade nitric acid to ph 2 samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms minimum reporting levels were 0 005 mg l fe and 0 0001 mg l mn the dataset including methods for sample collection and analysis can be found in schreiber et al 2022 to assess short term variability in metals concentrations and to calibrate and validate plsr models additional samples were collected every 2 4 h during two 24 hour campaigns the first campaign occurred on 16 17 october 2020 n 7 fig s8 the second campaign occurred on 10 11 june 2021 n 8 fig s9 all sampling data weekly and high frequency were used to calibrate plsr models calibration datasets were assessed for potential outliers using an ensemble approach implemented in the r package enpls xiao et al 2019 for each model an ensemble of 50 plsr sub models was generated using monte carlo resampling and the empirical predictive error distribution for each sample was used to identify outliers samples with a mean predictive error greater than three standard deviations from the mean predictive error for all samples or with a standard deviation greater than three times the mean standard deviation of all samples were considered potential outliers cao et al 2017 we took a conservative approach and did not eliminate all samples that met these criteria but rather only removed samples that were identified not only as outliers by the aforementioned method but also led to a deterioration of model fit showed signs of sampling analytical error or were collected during times of cuvette fouling after removing outliers the calibration datasets for the oxygen on deployment had approximately 30 more observations than for the turnover deployment fig 3 table 1 median fe and mn concentrations were substantially higher in the hypolimnion 6 2 8 0 and 9 0 m than the epilimnion 0 1 1 6 3 8 m during both deployments fig 3 2 4 predicting fe and mn concentrations from optical measurements using plsr we used plsr to compute predictions of total and soluble fe and mn concentrations based on the correlation between absorbance spectra and sampling data data analysis and qa qc was performed in the r programming environment r v 4 2 1 model building was conducted using the pls package mevik et al 2020 r core team 2022 the pls package has a built in function for determining the number of model components based on the root mean squared error of prediction rmsep using 10 fold cross validation mevik et al 2020 the algorithm randomly chooses a subset of the data to be withheld for validation while fitting the model to the rest of the data this is repeated across 10 random segments and the rmsep is computed for each component rmsep for each component is plotted against the number of components and the number of components included in the final plsr model is determined based on this curve generally as the number of components increases the rmsep curve decreases sharply until reaching an inflection point where it plateaus fig s18 to avoid overfitting we chose the number of components equal to this inflection point plus or minus one or the global minimum of the curve whichever resulted in the lowest number of components following etheridge et al 2014 birgand et al 2016 mevik et al 2020 furthermore it has been suggested that the number of components should not exceed 10 of the total number of observations used to calibrate the model mevik et al 2020 we followed this rule to the greatest extent possible in some cases the number of components slightly exceeded the 10 requirement but this only occurred when including an additional component would substantially decrease the rmsep determined by 10 fold cross validation while also improving the variance explained by the model given the sensitivity of the plsr method our approach was to optimize the tradeoff between model fit and predictive accuracy once the number of components was determined the model was fit to the observational data and predictions were made using the high frequency absorbance measurements in some cases plsr predicted slightly negative concentration values for the purposes of this analysis we considered negative values to have a value of 0 mg l for all variables unless stated otherwise separate plsr models were developed for each variable total fe soluble fe total mn and soluble mn and deployment based on the distinctly different chemical and biological characteristics between layers of the reservoir i e epilimnion and hypolimnion we found that the best fit was obtained when we used different models for the two layers in stratified reservoirs such as fcr fe and mn concentrations are higher in the hypolimnion than the epilimnion see fig 3 therefore we had an epilimnion model which included data from 0 1 1 6 and 3 8 m and a hypolimnion model which included data from 6 2 8 0 and 9 0 m table 1 although we also collected data from 5 0 m we did not include them in our analyses since this is at the transition between the two layers metalimnion see mcclure et al 2018 and thus not applicable to either layer we developed separate models for the turnover deployment and the oxygen on deployment in the end we had four separate models for each of the four variables total and soluble fe and mn resulting in 16 different models to assess the uncertainty of the predictions made using plsr we calculated nonparametric bootstrap predictive intervals following methods described by denham 1997 briefly a model was first fit to the available observational data y and absorbance spectra x using the predetermined number of components this model was used to make predictions e then the residuals of the original model were randomly sampled and added to y and e to obtain a new set of values for the dependent variable denoted here as y and new predictions denoted here as e a new model was fit to x and y and again used to make new predictions ê the prediction error was then calculated based on e ê this process was repeated 1000 times to obtain the bootstrapped error distribution g we then calculated the 0 05 and 0 95 quantiles of g which represented the 90 predictive intervals around the predictions from the original model denham 1997 model skill was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 from the linear regression between predicted and observed values as well as the root mean squared error of prediction rmsep for each model following wold et al 2001 and mevik et al 2020 all observational data including the spectrophotometer data are published in the environmental data initiative repository carey et al 2022a carey et al 2022b carey et al 2022c schreiber et al 2022 and hammond et al 2023 all code used to analyze the spectrophotometer data with plsr and generate the figures is available in the zenodo repository hammond 2022 3 results 3 1 routine fe and mn sampling trends weekly sampling at fcr showed levels of fe and mn in exceedance of the epa standards during the 2020 and 2021 stratified periods with maximum total fe and mn concentrations of 18 5 mg l and 2 2 mg l respectively fig 2 hypolimnetic concentrations of both metals generally increased throughout the summer stratified period of each year until reservoir fall turnover fig 2 following reservoir turnover concentrations of both metals remained 1 mg l until the following spring fig 2 3 2 plsr model performance a comparison of skill metrics among the 16 models revealed that plsr performed best for models calibrated with fe and mn concentrations greater than 0 03 mg l tables 1 s1 fig s10 model skill was also sensitive to the number of components included in each model for the turnover deployment the number of components included in the plsr models ranged from 3 to 5 9 14 of n for the oxygen on deployment 4 components were used for all plsr models 8 9 of n table 1 sample size was negatively correlated with r2 but positively correlated with rmsep fig s10 turnover deployment models explained a high proportion of the variability in total and soluble fe and mn concentrations r2 0 74 to 0 97 excluding hypolimnetic soluble fe which had a poor model fit r2 0 06 likely due to low concentrations median 0 02 mg l table 1 fig 3 in comparison oxygen on deployment models explained a lower proportion of the variability in total and soluble fe and mn concentrations r2 0 57 to 0 79 with one model of epilimnetic soluble mn having an r2 of 0 26 likely due to low concentrations median 0 01 mg l table 1 plsr model performance also varied between the hypolimnion and epilimnion for most models the epilimnetic plsr model had a higher r2 value than the corresponding hypolimnetic plsr model table 1 in most cases plsr predictions were within the range of concentration values in the calibration dataset figs 3 s11 12 but they did not capture some of the high magnitude fluctuations in the sampling data analysis of the fe and mn time series figs 4 d e and 5d e and calibration figs s11 12 suggests that inaccuracy in the models was largely attributed to calibration error for observations far from the mean concentration of the calibration data i e outliers additionally when predicting variables with low concentrations 0 03 mg l especially with the epilimnion models some predictions were in the negative range figs 4d e 5d e 3 3 reservoir turnover deployment 3 3 1 water temperature stratification and do concentrations do concentrations water temperature and schmidt stability varied considerably over the course of the turnover deployment fig 4a c prior to turnover do concentrations were strongly stratified by depth and exhibited large sub daily fluctuations in the epilimnion and metalimnion fig 4c hypolimnetic do concentrations were stable around 2 mg l during the pre turnover period due to the hox system operation fig 4c a sharp temperature gradient 4 7 c between the epilimnion and hypolimnion existed until approximately 3 days prior to turnover fig 4b however the water temperature profile equalized periodically between the metalimnion and hypolimnion prior to turnover indicating ephemeral periods of mixing between those layers fig 4b starting on 29 october 2020 the temperature gradient decreased progressively until the full water column temperature profile equalized on 02 november 2020 meeting our criteria for turnover 3 3 2 predicted fe and mn concentrations reservoir turnover had substantial impacts on fe and mn concentrations at the beginning of the deployment 16 october 2020 17 days prior to turnover both fe and mn displayed large differences in concentration between the epilimnion and hypolimnion fig 4d e the average total fe and total mn concentrations across all hypolimnetic depths 6 2 8 0 and 9 0 m were 3 73 mg l and 1 48 mg l across all epilimnetic depths 0 1 1 6 and 3 8 m they were 0 41 mg l and 0 14 mg l respectively fig 4d e substantial changes in epilimnetic concentrations were not observed until 24 h prior to turnover within that 24 hour period average epilimnetic total fe and total mn increased by 70 0 61 to 1 04 mg l and 66 0 29 to 0 48 mg l respectively in contrast to the epilimnion we observed declining total fe and mn concentrations in the hypolimnion prior to turnover fig 4d e between 16 october and 02 november 2020 hypolimnetic total fe and total mn concentrations declined at a rate of 0 13 and 0 11 mg l d respectively however there were also periods of fluctuations in total fe and total mn concentrations by as much as 1 mg l d fig 4d e in the 24 h prior to turnover average hypolimnetic total fe and total mn decreased by 45 2 09 to 1 14 mg l and 32 0 82 to 0 55 mg l respectively a strong concentration gradient between the epilimnion and hypolimnion remained for total fe and total mn until full reservoir turnover on 02 november 2020 after turnover water temperature and do rapidly equalized across the full water column coinciding with the rapid equalization of total fe and mn concentrations across the water column fig 4d e total fe and mn concentrations decreased and were less variable than during the pre turnover period fig 4d e the reservoir remained well mixed for 2 days but then shifting thermal gradients led to a temporary re stratification that began on 02 november 2020 and lasted until the end of the deployment on 09 november 2020 fig 4a b the re stratification of the reservoir was also evident in total fe and total mn concentrations fig 4d e 3 4 oxygen on deployment 3 4 1 water temperature stratification and do do concentrations water temperature and schmidt stability differed considerably between the two deployments fig 5 a c at the start of the oxygen on deployment 26 may 2021 16 days prior to hox activation epilimnetic do concentrations were high 5 15 mg l and exhibited a consistent decline throughout the deployment due to warm air temperatures fig s14 metalimnetic and hypolimnetic do concentrations were both approximately 0 mg l throughout the deployment the water temperature profile shows distinctly stratified layers in the reservoir prior to hox operation with a sharp temperature gradient throughout the epilimnion for the entire deployment and a slight temperature gradient in the hypolimnion fig 5b immediately following hox activation on 11 june 2021 the water temperature profile equalized across layers below 6 m depth indicating mixing within the hypolimnion due to hox activation fig 5b the water temperature profile in the epilimnion was unaffected by hox operation metalimnetic and hypolimnetic do concentrations did not increase above 0 mg l in the few days after activation of the hox system this is attributed to chemical oxygen demand in the hypolimnion resulting from elevated concentrations of reduced solutes e g fe ii and mn ii 3 4 2 predicted fe and mn concentrations at the beginning of the deployment the highest concentrations of total fe and mn were at the lowest depth 9 m and concentrations decreased upwards in the water column with a sharp decrease between the hypolimnion and epilimnion fig 5d e in the first 24 h of the deployment total fe and mn concentrations averaged across all epilimnetic depths were 0 43 and 0 03 mg l respectively while across the hypolimnetic depths they were 2 71 and 0 54 mg l respectively prior to hox operation both total fe and mn in the hypolimnion exhibited large sub daily fluctuations which resulted in concentration changes of up to 1 62 mg l hr and 0 19 mg l hr respectively fig 5d e these sub daily fluctuations were most pronounced at the lowest depth the spatial and temporal dynamics of fe and mn concentrations were significantly affected by hypolimnetic oxygenation prior to activation of the hox system on 11 june 2021 epilimnetic total fe and mn concentrations remained constant sd 0 07 mg l and 0 004 mg l respectively and had maximum concentrations of 0 63 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively hypolimnetic total fe and mn concentrations during this period were much more variable sd 1 85 mg l and 0 19 mg l respectively with maximum concentrations of 7 90 mg l and 1 08 mg l respectively shortly after hox activation total fe and mn concentrations equalized contemporaneously with the equalization of water temperature across the hypolimnetic depths indicating that this layer of the reservoir was well mixed with respect to fe and mn fig 5b 5d e in contrast differences in total fe and mn concentrations across the epilimnetic depths increased slightly after activation of the hox system approximately 6 h after turning on the hox system total fe and mn at 9 m depth declined by approximately 2 5 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively fig 5d e concentrations of total fe and mn at all hypolimnetic depths subsequently increased over the next 24 h before eventually stabilizing over the following 24 h at concentrations of 1 5 3 5 mg l and 0 5 0 75 mg l respectively for the remainder of the deployment total fe and mn concentrations remained equal across all hypolimnetic depths and exhibited less variability fig 5d e 3 5 predicted fe and mn soluble to total ratios the ratio of predicted soluble to total fe sfe tfe and mn smn tmn was calculated to assess redox transformations we observed distinct changes in these ratios over the course of both deployments most notably in the hypolimnion fig 6 during the turnover deployment the hypolimnion was maintained at oxic conditions pre turnover due to hox and post turnover due to mixing as expected hypolimnetic sfe tfe was approximately 0 during this entire deployment indicating that all fe in the hypolimnion was in the particulate fraction soluble fe particulate fe total fe in contrast hypolimnetic smn tmn was approximately 1 at the beginning of the deployment indicating that all mn was in the soluble fraction however in the week prior to turnover hypolimnetic smn tmn oscillated between 0 5 and 1 following turnover smn tmn remained greater than 0 75 until the end of the deployment at the beginning of the oxygen on deployment sfe tfe differed greatly with depth in the hypolimnion with ratios greater than 0 8 at 9 m depth and ratios close to 0 at 6 2 m and 8 m depths fig 6c d between the beginning of the deployment and hox activation on 11 june 2021 the sfe tfe at 6 2 m and 8 m increased continuously to approximately the same level as 9 m fig 6c d just before the initiation of hox operation the sfe tfe at all hypolimnion depths was 0 75 indicating that most of the fe in the hypolimnion was in the soluble fraction however immediately after turning the hox system on the sfe tfe in the hypolimnion decreased steadily in the 48 hour period after hox activation the sfe tfe in the hypolimnion declined to less than 0 25 until the end of the experimental period fig 6c d indicating oxidation processes in contrast to fe smn tmn in the hypolimnion was 0 90 for the entire deployment we did not observe a significant effect of hox operation on smn tmn 0 99 pre hox 0 97 post hox 4 discussion 4 1 plsr modeling of high frequency absorbance spectra can predict fe and mn concentrations using uv visible absorbance spectra and plsr modeling we made hourly predictions of fe and mn concentrations at 6 depths in our study reservoir our results indicate that this method can successfully predict fe and mn concentrations with some limitations discussed below based on their covariability with uv vis absorbance spectra despite the paucity of clearly defined absorbance peaks for these elements plsr models were able to explain a high proportion of the variability in the sampling data see r2 values in table 1 and predictions agreed with expected trends in fe and mn concentrations for example the rapid decline in sfe tfe following the onset of hox operation fig 6c matches expectations based on the rapid oxidation kinetics of fe ii in the presence of oxygen davison and seed 1983 previous studies have also demonstrated substantial decreases in soluble fe following short periods of hox dent et al 2014 munger et al 2016 krueger et al 2020 based on model skill metrics i e r2 and rmsep and visual inspection of the predicted time series accurate predictions of fe and mn concentrations using this method are influenced by numerous factors including the range and variance of concentrations in the calibration dataset the sample size used for calibration the number of outliers in the calibration dataset the number of components in the plsr model and the inherent predictability of each variable at a particular site i e the strength of correlation with the uv vis absorbance spectra our results suggest that our methodology may be most appropriate for measuring elevated concentrations of fe and mn 0 1 mg l this result agrees with vaughan et al 2018 who suggested that the application of this method to predict riverine total phosphorus tp concentrations was best for sites with elevated tp 0 1 mg l concentrations in our study plsr models fit to data with concentrations of fe and mn 0 03 mg l generally did not perform well for example soluble fe during the turnover deployment had median concentrations of 0 02 mg l in the hypolimnion fig 3 and table s1 accordingly the plsr models for hypolimnetic soluble fe had the lowest r2 0 06 and highest rmsep relative to median calibration concentration out of any model for the turnover deployment tables 1 s1 our plsr models were also sensitive to the range and variance of sampling data used for calibration preliminary model testing revealed that plsr models were hindered by the distinct water chemistry between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic depths fe and mn mean differences 1 3 mg l and 0 8 mg l respectively see fig 3 and therefore models were generated separately for each reservoir layer this conforms with findings of previous studies using in situ uv vis spectrophotometers and plsr in waterbodies which all achieved higher accuracy with site specific models avagyan et al 2014 vaughan et al 2018 etheridge et al 2014 however when comparing pairs of plsr models i e the same variable depth combination between the two deployments the models fit to data with a higher standard deviation had higher r2 values with the sole exception of hypolimnetic total fe tables 1 and s1 these results suggest that there is a tradeoff between capturing the maximum variability in observed concentrations and the limitations imposed by the degree of covariability between the uv vis absorbance spectra and the variable of interest also observed by avagyan et al 2014 and allen 2021 to achieve an accurate predictive model grouping data based on the spatial and temporal context of measurement achieved a better fitting model while still maximizing the variability captured in the calibration data birgand et al 2016 used a similar approach for making predictions of soluble fe concentrations in fcr after the activation of a hox system they obtained a slightly better model fit indicated by an r2 value of 0 94 compared to our r2 values of 0 79 and 0 75 epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively for the oxygen on deployment we used calibration sample sizes of 48 and 45 epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively while birgand et al 2016 used 27 however they used 5 components in their plsr model whereas we used 4 components thus the higher r2 value for their model may be attributed to a higher ratio of components to sample size 18 compared to our study 8 9 which has been shown in other applications of plsr mevik et al 2020 etheridge et al 2014 birgand et al 2016 our results captured sub weekly patterns in fe and mn dynamics in fcr but the plsr predicted time series of fe and mn concentrations was not able to adequately capture some of the high magnitude sub daily fluctuations that were observed in the sampling data figs 4 and 6 this is likely due to varying plsr model skill which is related to the sample size and distribution of data used for calibration the number of plsr model components and the inherent predictability of each variable therefore it follows that the strength of correlation between the uv vis absorbance spectra and fe mn concentrations plays a strong role in determining the limits to the temporal resolution this relationship can be refined through the methodological suggestions outlined below but ultimately depends upon the spectral properties of the study system there are several limitations of this method that should be addressed in future research in our reservoir the cuvette fitted on the spectrophotometer experienced fouling likely due to fe and mn in the hypolimnion that oxidized and precipitated on the cuvette walls upon exposure to oxygen despite our efforts to limit fouling see methods there was still a fouling signal detected in several periods of our time series although fouling occurred the plsr models still provided a remarkably good numerical correction for this fouling signal for future work we recommend collection of additional calibration samples obtained at regular intervals between servicing dates as this will give a chance for the plsr model to correct for the timing and kinetics of the optics fouling and may thus lower uncertainties we also found that truncating the uv vis absorbance spectra used for calibration to only include wavelengths greater than 250 nm substantially improved the model skill and diminished spikes in the time series of predictions that corresponded to periods of heavy fouling figs s6 and s7 finally we focused this study on high frequency measurements over a short term day to week and not on long term month to year predictions additional work would need to be done with longer deployments and calibration data to establish if longer term predictions can be made 4 2 fe and mn concentrations change gradually in response to weakening stratification and rapidly in response to fall turnover trends in predicted fe and mn concentrations shed light on the changes that occurred in the reservoir before and after turnover hypolimnetic concentrations of fe and mn began declining 17 and 9 days prior to turnover respectively and shorter periods of more rapid concentration fluctuations were superimposed upon these patterns of decline fig 4d e combined these results suggest that turnover at least in our study reservoir is not a discrete event but rather a process occurring over an extended time period mcmahon 1969 measured a similar decrease in soluble fe using daily samples for nine days across spring mixing in a dimictic lake soluble fe concentrations decreased by more than one order of magnitude 5 days prior to full circulation mcmahon 1969 did not offer any interpretation of this phenomenon simply stating that the changes in soluble fe were concurrent with vernal circulation similar trends have also been observed in other parameters of biogeochemical relevance for example kankaala et al 2007 found that the majority of ch4 in the hypolimnion of a lake was microbially oxidized at the oxycline boundary during a month long period of weakening stratification before complete mixing occurred resulting in lower effluxes of ch4 to the atmosphere during turnover predicted fe and mn concentration data can be compared to other time series data to infer mechanisms behind the declining fe and mn concentrations prior to turnover based on trends in schmidt stability and water temperature fig 4a b reservoir stratification was weakening for a 9 day period prior to full turnover in response to daily and hourly shifts in meteorological conditions including air temperature and wind speed fig s13 mixing between the hypolimnion and metalimnion as indicated by the homogenization of water temperature between these layers occurred periodically throughout the deployment with an increasing frequency as turnover approached figs 4a b s15 these ephemeral periods of mixing between the hypolimnion and metalimnion likely led to exchange of fe and mn between layers which suggests that hydrodynamic processes occurring on hourly to daily time scales may have a substantial influence of fe and mn cycling however without fe and mn concentration data at a high spatiotemporal resolution these patterns would not be observed the flexibility of using a multiplexor spectrophotometer system with a customized prediction algorithm e g site specific plsr models allows for the quantification of high resolution elemental stoichiometry by making predictions of both the soluble and total fractions of fe and mn during the turnover deployment fe was predominantly composed of the total fraction whereas mn was largely composed of the soluble fraction until approximately one week before turnover at which time the smn tmn ratio began to decline fig 6b this coincided with the onset of declining total mn concentrations that continued until turnover excluding a 2 day period from 28 october to 30 october 2020 when total mn concentrations temporarily increased fig 4e the shift to declining smn tmn and total mn concentrations also coincided with increased frequency of mixing between the metalimnion and hypolimnion and declining stratification intensity figs 4a b and 6b these trends suggest that declining total mn concentrations in the pre turnover period were the result of increased oxidation of mn ii perhaps due to the exposure of mn ii in the hypolimnion to mn oxidizing microbes that inhabit the metalimnion as demonstrated by a previous study at fcr showing that the presence of mn oxidizing microorganisms can substantially increase mn oxidation rates munger et al 2016 4 3 hypolimnetic oxygenation causes rapid oxidation of fe with lesser impact on mn the mux spectrophotometer system enabled us to observe fe and mn concentration changes in response to hypolimnetic oxygenation at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution fe and mn concentrations in the hypolimnion both spiked in the 48 h following oxygenation then declined fig 5d e however fe concentrations decreased to levels lower than they were prior to oxygenation especially at the lowest depth whereas mn concentrations declined to approximately the same levels prior to oxygenation fig 5d e these results suggest that the hox system physically mixed the hypolimnion with respect to both metals as total fe and total mn concentrations quickly converged across hypolimnetic depths after turning on the hox system fig 5d e the physical mixing induced by the hox system appeared to affect fe and mn similarly suggesting that the spike in total fe and mn immediately following hox activation was a result of increased mixing and or entrainment of particulates in the hypolimnion due to stirring of the bottom sediments the convergence of fe and mn concentrations across hypolimnetic depths has previously been observed in response to hox activation gerling et al 2014 but results from this study reveal that this can occur in less than 24 h and may subsequently be followed by an ephemeral spike in total fe and mn concentrations concentrations of total fe and mn displayed more short term variability prior to hox activation than they did post activation this was especially pronounced at the lowest depth 9m where concentrations fluctuated significantly over a period of less than 24 h fig 5d e given that the sfe tfe ratio in the upper and middle hypolimnion 6 2 m and 8 m steadily increased during the pre hox period fig 6c likely due to diffusion of soluble fe out of the lower hypolimnion the rapid fluctuations in total fe in the lower hypolimnion may have been attributed to shifting diffusion gradients however similar patterns in short term variability were observed in fe and mn despite the fact that mn was predominantly in the soluble phase for the entire deployment suggesting that diffusion of soluble mn out of the lower hypolimnion was not responsible for the pre hox rapid fluctuations observed at 9 m the change in redox conditions caused by adding do to the hypolimnion had a much more pronounced effect on fe than mn as has been observed in other studies e g gantzer et al 2009 the contrasting responses of fe and mn to oxygenation can be seen most clearly in the resulting changes in soluble total ratios fig 6 the sfe tfe ratio in the hypolimnion exhibited a nearly constant linear decline in the 48 h post oxygenation and remained below 0 25 for the remainder of the deployment this indicates that soluble fe in the water column was rapidly oxidized by the hox system even though there was no measurable increase in hypolimnetic do this is further supported by the fact that the mean hypolimnetic total fe concentration was consistently lower after hox operation began than it was previously the observed trends in sfe tfe ratios agree with previous research on the effects of hox systems on fe in lakes and reservoirs for example dent et al 2014 found that sfe tfe declined to 0 58 after 8 h of hypolimnetic oxygenation in our study it took approximately twice as long 16 h for sfe tfe to reach 0 58 however the fe concentrations in dent et al 2014 were lower 0 17 2 88 mg l than those in our study 0 31 7 42 mg l in contrast to fe the smn tmn ratio in the hypolimnion displayed only a very slight response approximately 2 decrease to hox activation demonstrating that hypolimnetic oxygenation did not result in significant oxidation of mn at the timescale of our deployments our results agree with those from dent et al 2014 who found that mn was still 100 in the soluble phase 8 h after oxygenation furthermore previous studies at fcr have also showed that soluble mn does not respond significantly to oxygenation alone and that other factors such as microbially mediated oxidation reservoir ph range 6 4 7 1 observed in the hypolimnion during our study sorption and dilution from physical mixing are more important variables impacting hypolimnetic soluble mn than oxygenation munger et al 2016 krueger et al 2020 5 conclusions results from this study demonstrate that coupling a spectrophotometer with a multiplexed pumping system enabled high frequency monitoring of fe and mn at multiple depths in our study reservoir providing a unique ability to observe hour resolution biogeochemical dynamics in a freshwater ecosystem although there are limitations to the method our findings confirm that it is possible to correlate the color matrix light absorbance rich data of water to parameters not known to absorb light using a site specific statistical calibration plsr to unveil processes tightly coupled in space and in time our results underscore the importance of implementing robust and consistent methodologies for obtaining calibration concentrations choosing the number of components in plsr models and quantifying the uncertainty around predictions the high spatiotemporal resolution predictions provide novel insights into fe and mn dynamics that could improve aquatic monitoring programs and reservoir management practices first we demonstrated that fe and mn concentrations can fluctuate significantly on time scales much shorter than those employed by most traditional monitoring programs for example sub daily fluctuations of total fe and mn during the oxygen on deployment resulted in concentration changes of up to 1 62 mg l hr and 0 19 mg l hr respectively considering that the secondary drinking water standards for fe and mn are 0 3 and 0 05 mg l respectively sub daily concentration changes of this magnitude are critical for water quality management second we observed an increase in total hypolimnetic fe and mn in response to the re stratification of our study reservoir two days after turnover which contradicts the common assumption that metals concentrations equalize and decrease during the mixed period following turnover last our results offer new insights on the rapid response of fe to hypolimnetic oxygenation within hours of activating the system the soluble to total fe ratio indicated oxidation of fe even though there was no measurable increase in do this study emphasizes the power of high spatiotemporal resolution data for improving our understanding of biogeochemical cycles by unveiling previously unobserved processes altering fe and mn concentrations authorship

14722,pore wetting induced by surfactants and salt scaling is a major obstacle to the industrial application of membrane distillation md identifying the transition of wetting stages and achieving early monitoring of pore wetting are crucial for wetting control herein we made a pioneering attempt to use ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr technique to non invasively detect the pore wetting in a direct contact md and explain the utdr waveform with the help of optical coherence tomography oct imaging the results showed that the water vapor interface had a strong reflection to ultrasound reflection coefficient 0 9995 while the water membrane and water scaling layer interfaces showed relatively weak reflection therefore utdr could effectively detect the movement of water vapor interface with the low interference from the signals generated by the membrane and scaling layer for the surfactant induced wetting the occurrence of wetting could be successfully detected by the right shift in phase and the reduction in amplitude of the utdr waveform moreover the wetting depth could be accurately calculated by the time of flight tof and ultrasonic velocity for scaling induced wetting the waveform slightly shifted to the left at the beginning due to the growth of scaling layer then to the right because the left shift was surpassed by the right shift of the waveform caused by pore wetting both for the surfactant and scaling induced wetting the variation of the utdr waveform was sensitive to wetting dynamics and the right shift of phase and the reduction in amplitude of the waveform could act as early monitoring signals to the occurrence of wetting graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr pore wetting membrane distillation optical coherence tomography oct early monitoring scaling 1 introduction membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process that uses a microporous hydrophobic membrane to realize the separation of water and non volatile solutes e g salts chang et al 2021 horseman et al 2021 this process with the usage of low grade energy is promising for hypersaline water desalination xu et al 2022 wastewater treatment yan et al 2023 zhong et al 2021 and resource recovery naidu et al 2020 during the operation of md membrane pore wetting i e the formation of liquid passages in hydrophobic pores can lead to serious losses of solute rejection horseman et al 2021 to recover the rejection complex cleaning and drying operations are required abdel karim et al 2021 rezaei et al 2018b therefore membrane wetting is a major obstacle to the widespread application of md horseman et al 2021 the pore wetting could be regarded as the progressive advancement of a water vapor interface from the pore entrance to the distillate side ultimately resulting in the complete filling of the hydrophobic pore horseman et al 2021 according to the previous studies surfactant and scaling are the two main reasons for wetting chang et al 2021 rezaei et al 2018a for the surfactant induced wetting the surfactant may reduce the surface tension of feed solution and decrease the hydrophobicity of membranes shao et al 2022 wang et al 2018 thereby promoting pore wetting for the scaling induced wetting the continuous growth of crystals e g gypsum christie et al 2020 or repeated dissolution crystallization of crystals e g nacl shi et al 2022 in hydrophobic pores lead to the propagation of water vapor interfaces and the subsequent filling of the hydrophobic pores generally wetting is not an instantaneous process and the total duration may last for several days when treating actual wastewater choudhury et al 2019 if one can take timely detection at the beginning of wetting i e the time when the water vapor interface just leaves the entrance of pores it may have chance to prevent the formation of full liquid passages and thus avoid the failure of solute rejection therefore early monitoring of wetting is highly desirable for a membrane pore the wetting process could be classified into three stages unwetted fully wetted and transition states semi wetting stage horseman et al 2021 jacob et al 2020 when the membrane pore is in the semi wetting stage it is difficult to identify by observeing the change in distillate water conductivity due to the continued presence of air gaps in the membrane pore however studying the semi wetting stage has significant implications for understanding the mechanism of membrane wetting and for early warning of membrane wetting gong et al 2023 shi et al 2023 to date researchers have employed various approaches to investigate the wetting in the membrane pores in md process including the use of regular geometric structures as models chamani et al 2020 2022 qtaishat et al 2022 rana et al 2022 as well as in situ online characterization and monitoring tools in an attempt to gain a more intuitive understanding of the wetting process bauer et al 2019 chen et al 2017 jacob et al 2020 luo et al 2023 however due to the different pore structures and diversity of substances involved in wetting process no unified mechanism of pore wetting in md is establish currently and additional membrane wetting monitoring technologies are still needed according to the previous studies in situ techniques for the early monitoring of membrane wetting include transmembrane impedance chen et al 2017 deka et al 2021 wong et al 2022 light transmittance jacob et al 2020 kim et al 2019 optical coherence tomography oct bauer et al 2019 liu et al 2021b shao et al 2022 etc the transmembrane impedance is based on the principle that the impedance decreases during the wetting process i e the reduction in the length of unwetted pores or air gaps with pre embedded electrodes in md modules the decrease in transmembrane impedance could be regarded as the early signal of wetting occurrence chen et al 2017 while the detailed wetting spots cannot be detected the light transmittance is based on the increase in the light transmittance of a membrane with the advancement of the water vapor interface kim et al 2019 oct is based on the reflection of light from the wetting layer and the water vapor interface which can perform optical imaging on the wetting layer in real time shao et al 2022 as optical based methods light transmittance and oct can only be used in transparent md modules which may only be available in the laboratory therefore novel strategies that can realize non invasive and early monitoring of membrane wetting are still needed ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr technique uses the ultrasonic echo of an interface with a high ultrasonic reflexivity li et al 2017 mairal et al 1999 qiu et al 2022 with the time of flight tof of the ultrasound i e the time from a pulse ultrasound sending to the corresponding echo receiving the location of the interface could be detected utdr technique has been successfully applied to investigate the thickness of fouling and scaling layers in membrane based processes cai et al 2011 lai et al 2020 li et al 2014 mairal et al 2000 sim et al 2012 due to the big difference in acoustic impedance between water and air z water 2 13 106 kg m2 s and z air 414 kg m2 s more acoustic impedance information is shown in table s1 the ultrasonic wave could be strongly reflected at a water vapor interface making it possible to track the movement of water vapor interface during wetting therefore the utdr technique may have the potential to realize the early monitoring and warning of pore wetting in this study the utdr technique was applied to monitor the pore wetting in a direct contact md we established the relationship between wetting stages and the utdr waveforms with the help of wetting layers imaging by an oct system based on this relationship we successfully used utdr to realize the early monitoring of wetting induced by a surfactant and a salt scaling this study highlights that utdr could non invasively detect the water vapor interface in md thereby realizing early monitoring of membrane wetting 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and

into two beams one beam is emitted to a sample and the other beam as reference light interferes with the light reflected by the sample the cross sectional image of the sample can be obtained by processing these optical signals in this study an oct gan220c1 thorlab usa with a scanning lens oct lk3 bb thorlabs usa was used to observe the membrane wetting in the md system fig 1 axial and lateral resolutions of the oct system were 3 μm and 8 μm respectively the change in pixel brightness of the cross sectional images was used to analyze the wetting depth shao et al 2022 2 5 ultrasonic

top surface of md cell the pulse transceiver sent an electrical signal to the transducer which transformed the signal into an ultrasonic wave with a frequency of 10 mhz once the ultrasonic passed an interface between two media with distinct acoustic impedances an ultrasonic echo was generated the ultrasonic echo could be received by the transducer then sent back to the pulse transceiver and finally received by the oscilloscope the waveform of the echo could be displayed by the screen of oscilloscope in real time the data of echo were analyzed through jupyterlab version 3 3 2 2 6 calculation of the displacement and acoustic properties of an interface displacement of an interface δ l could be calculated by the sound velocity v and the change of tof δ t 1 δ l v δ t 2 where δl is

respectively the reflection coefficient rr was used to quantitatively analyze the amplitude of the reflected waveform relative to the incident wave the transmission coefficient rt was used to quantitatively analyze the amplitude of the transmitted waveform relative to the incident wave both coefficients are related to the acoustic impedance z of the media on both sides of the interface which can be calculated according to the following equations 3 r r z i 1 z i z i 1 z i 4 r t 2 z i 1 z i 1 z i where zi and zi 1 represent the acoustic impedances of the medium at the incident side and the transmission side of an interface respectively according to eq 3 the calculated reflection coefficient of a water vapor interface reaches rr 0 9995 due to the great difference in acoustic impedance between water and air while the transmission coefficient is only rt 0 0005 mainly owing to the low acoustic impedance of air supporting information provides more information about related interface such as water pvdf interface water membrane interface wetting layer unwetting layer interface which are convenient to better understand the mechanism for the variation of echo table s2 if a medium is a uniform mixture of different substance the acoustic impedance can be calculated as follows 5 z i 1 k ρ i α i i 1 k α i v i where ρi represents the density of the ith substance in the homogeneous media for example for a pvdf membrane with a porosity of 0 75 in surfactant induced wetting the calculated value of the acoustic impedance of the wetting layer and unwetted layer are zwet 2 13 106 kg m2 s and zunwet 0 21 106 kg m2 s respectively supporting information provides more information about the properties of relative media including gypsum pure caso4 2h2o gypsum scaling layer assumed porosity 0 8 feed solution in surfactant induced wetting water containing 3 5 wt nacl at 60 c etc table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 utdr analysis at different wetting stages membrane wetting is a dynamic process and its ultrasonic signal varied in different wetting stages therefore we analyzed the echo waveforms of typical wetting stages to better understand the dynamic changes in the echo signals during the development of wetting unwetted membrane the water vapor interface of an unwetted membrane coincides with the membrane surface fig 2 a 1 and consequently the oct image only shows one bright band fig 2b 1 both the water vapor and the water membrane interface can reflect ultrasound however because of the high porosity of the membrane the area of the water vapor interface is larger than that of the water membrane interface more importantly the acoustic reflection of the water vapor interface rr 0 9995 is much larger than that of the water membrane interface rr 0 5115 table s2 therefore the echo waveform fig 2c 1 of the unwetted membrane is mainly derived from the water vapor interface at the membrane surface semi wetted membrane fig 2a 2 shows a homogeneous semi wetting membrane which is featured by a water vapor interface nearly parallel to the membrane surface the homogeneous semi wetting could be caused by high concentration surfactants or highly soluble salt scaling shao et al 2022 shi et al 2022 since the infrared light is reflected by the water membrane interface and water vapor interface successively the oct image fig 2b 2 clearly shows two bright bands where the upper one represents the membrane surface and the lower one means the water vapor interface the displacement of the water vapor interface separating from the membrane surface results in the delay of tof δ t i e the right shift of the waveform fig 2c 2 with the ultrasonic velocity in the wetting layer calculated by eq 2 it is possible to obtain the depth of the wetting layer according to eq 1 fig 2a 3 shows an inhomogeneous semi wetting stage compared with the homogeneous semi wetting fig 2a 2 2b 2 this type of semi wetting is characterized by uneven wetting depths the echo waveform fig 2c 3 can be regarded as the superposition of echoes of water vapor interfaces at different wetting depths the phase shift may be regarded as an average of different wetting depths the amplitude of fig 2c 3 is lower than that of fig 2b 2 as a result of the more dissipation and interference of echoes induced by the inhomogeneous water vapor interface fully wetted membrane at this wetting stage water fills membrane pores with the disappearance of the water vapor interface fig 2a 4 therefore only the membrane feed solution interface and the membrane distillate solution interface could reflect ultrasound however both interfaces have a poor reflection of ultrasound rr 0 18 see fig s2 for detailed calculation leading to such a low amplitude of the waveform fig 2c 4 this weak echo of water membrane interface has little interference on the echo of water vapor interface making it possible to monitor the water vapor interface with the utdr method scaling layer on a fully wetted membrane in scaling induced wetting a scaling layer can form on the membrane surface the echo reflected by the water crystal interface may interfere with the echo of the water vapor interface to investigate the ultrasonic reflection of scaling layers we investigated the echo waveform fig 2c 5 of the scaling layer on a fully wetted membrane fig 2b 5 because the water crystal interface is closer to the transducer the tof of the echo reduced resulting in the left shifted waveform due to the weak reflection of the water crystal interface table s2 the amplitude of the echo waveform reflected by the scaling layer is low fig 2c 5 suggesting a low influence of the scaling layer on the detection of the water vapor interface 3 2 monitoring surfactant induced wetting dynamics with utdr for the unwetted pvdf membrane the water vapor interface overlapped the membrane surface fig 2a 1 in the corresponding oct image fig 3 b 1 only one bright band could be distinguished when the hydrophobic membrane was wetted the water vapor interface entered membrane pores and moved towards the distillate side the upper and lower bright bands in the oct images represented the membrane surface and the water vapor interface respectively fig 3b 2 and 3b 3 the distance between these two bright bands increased gradually with the advancement of wetting for the echo waveforms fig 3a the wetting occurrence led to the decreased amplitude and the right shift of phase fig s3 this could be ascribed to the propagation of the water vapor interface towards the distillate side fig 2 when the membrane pore was completely wetted at the 9th min fig 3b 4 the amplitude of the echo signal significantly decreased fig 3a with the disappearance of the water vapor interface which has a strong reflection to ultrasonic in the oct images fig 3b the wetting depth could be obtained by measuring the distance between the membrane surface and the water vapor interface shao et al 2022 for the utdr echo fig 3a the wetting depth could also be calculated by the change in tof and sound velocity eq 1 fig 3c compares the wetting depth obtained by utdr and oct techniques both sets of data were near the line of y x fig 3c indicating that the wetting depth calculated by utdr was in good agreement with that obtained by oct which confirmed that the utdr technique could accurately monitor the propagation of wetting interfaces in a surfactant induced wetting experiment the dynamic variation of wetting depth obtained by utdr is shown in fig 4 the addition of surfactant resulted in an immediate propagation of the water vapor interface while the vapor flux and distillate conductivity were unchanged until some of the membrane pores were completely wetted after a few minutes thus we could realize early monitoring of surfactant induced wetting by investigating the variation of tof and amplitude of echo waveforms of the utdr which could avoid fully wetting of membranes 3 3 monitoring gypsum induced wetting dynamics with utdr when the feed solution contained 25 mmol l of caso4 gypsum crystal would soon deposit on the membrane surface and form an inhomogeneous scaling layer fig 5 b1 3 due to the low ultrasonic reflexivity of the water crystal interface table s2 and the loose structure of scaling layer fig 5b most of the ultrasonic waves passed through the scaling layer and were reflected by the water vapor interface however because the water crystal interface could still weakly reflect ultrasound rr 0 2362 table s2 as well as the increased sound velocity in scaling layer the echo waveform slightly shifted left at the beginning figs 2c 1 2c 5 and 5a around the 40th minute however the waveform began to shift right this could be explained by the thickening of the scaling layer accompanied by scaling induced inhomogeneous semi wetting gryta 2005 rezaei et al 2018b causing the water vapor interface to move away from the transducer around the 40th minute the right shift of the waveform caused by wetting surpassed the left shift of the waveform caused by scaling layer the corresponding oct images 40th minute fig 5b 3 also indicated that the membrane surface began to appear wetted spots where the brightness of the membrane surface was relatively faint shi et al 2022 after 50 min with the processing of scaling induced wetting the right shift of the waveform became larger the amplitude of the waveform decreased gradually because gypsum scaling generally led to inhomogeneous wetting christie et al 2020 resulting in scattering attenuation of the ultrasonic zheng et al 2021 these results showed that the change in utdr echo could well reflect the dynamic of scaling induced wetting because the formation of scaling layer affected the detection of water vapor interface by udtr to some extent we further analyzed the changes in δt and amplitude in the scaling induced wetting fig 6 to better realize the early warning of scaling induced wetting in the first 40 min due to the growth of the scaling layer the δt decreased from 0 to 0 038 μs however the δ t started to continuously increase largely after 40 min for the amplitude of the echo it remained unchanged in the first 30 min and decreased continuously thereafter according to fig 2c 3 inhomogeneous semi wetting stage could cause the waveform to shift right and the amplitude to decrease the stage of which corresponded with the growth of some semi wetting spots in the oct images at 30 40 min fig 5 b2 3 thus it could be considered that severe scaling induced wetting occurred around 30 40 min after which the δt started to increase and the amplitude continued to decrease this was corresponded to the simulation in fig s4 whose knee point was around the 40th min it was not until 120 min that the conductivity of the distillate solution began to increase indicating the formation of spots of fully wetting therefore the increase in δt and the decrease in amplitude may provide an early warning of scaling induced wetting 3 4 implications for the early monitoring of wetting using utdr because the strong ultrasonic reflection at the water vapor interface and the relatively weak ultrasonic reflection at the water membrane interface fig 2 we successful used the utdr technique to monitor the wetting dynamics in an md according to figs 3 6 both for surfactant induced and scaling induced wetting the echo waveforms experienced the reduction of amplitude and the right shift of waveform at the beginning of wetting therefore when the amplitude of utdr signal decreases and the waveform shifts right it is possible that the membrane has undergone pore wetting since no fully wetting occurs at this time we can still prevent the further development of wetting through the strategies such as pretreatment and chemical cleaning deshmukh et al 2018 guillen burrieza et al 2014 although utdr technique has been used to monitor the membrane fouling and scaling in membrane processes to the best of our knowledge it has not been used for wetting detection in md compared with membrane fouling and scaling membrane wetting is different in terms of principles and occurrence position membrane surface vs membrane interior kiefer et al 2019 and therefore our study may extend the application of utdr as a type of non invasive real time and in situ method for wetting detection in md utdr technique can directly place the probe on the out wall of the membrane module ultrasonic based measurement is well developed in many applications and thus the wetting detection with utdr may have a high potential for scale up due to the different wetting speeds at different positions in the membrane module the probe can be placed at the position where wetting is more likely to occur such as the inlet of the membrane module luo et al 2023 however there remains considerable scope for improving the accuracy and sensitivity of ultrasonic technologies in particular the detection of the inner membrane of the spring wound membrane module is an ongoing challenge that requires further investigation and optimization 4 conclusion in this study we found utdr could effectively detect the water vapor interface in md and successfully used utdr to analyze the dynamic of wetting induced by triton x 100 and gypsum the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the water vapor interface showed a strong reflection of ultrasonic while the water membrane and water crystal interface showed relatively weak reflections therefore utdr could effectively detect the water vapor interface in md 2 when surfactant induced wetting occurred the amplitude of utdr waveforms decreased and its phase shifted right according to the change in tof and the ultrasonic velocity the wetting depths of a homogeneous wetting could be accurately measured 3 in gypsum scaling induced wetting the growth of scaling layer could interfere the echo of water vapor interface leading to a slightly decrease in tof at the beginning 0 30 min however the strong signal of wetting quickly surpassed the interference of scaling layer leading to a continuous increase in tof 4 the decrease in amplitude and increase in tof could be used as early monitoring signals for pore wetting in md declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14722,pore wetting induced by surfactants and salt scaling is a major obstacle to the industrial application of membrane distillation md identifying the transition of wetting stages and achieving early monitoring of pore wetting are crucial for wetting control herein we made a pioneering attempt to use ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr technique to non invasively detect the pore wetting in a direct contact md and explain the utdr waveform with the help of optical coherence tomography oct imaging the results showed that the water vapor interface had a strong reflection to ultrasound reflection coefficient 0 9995 while the water membrane and water scaling layer interfaces showed relatively weak reflection therefore utdr could effectively detect the movement of water vapor interface with the low interference from the signals generated by the membrane and scaling layer for the surfactant induced wetting the occurrence of wetting could be successfully detected by the right shift in phase and the reduction in amplitude of the utdr waveform moreover the wetting depth could be accurately calculated by the time of flight tof and ultrasonic velocity for scaling induced wetting the waveform slightly shifted to the left at the beginning due to the growth of scaling layer then to the right because the left shift was surpassed by the right shift of the waveform caused by pore wetting both for the surfactant and scaling induced wetting the variation of the utdr waveform was sensitive to wetting dynamics and the right shift of phase and the reduction in amplitude of the waveform could act as early monitoring signals to the occurrence of wetting graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr pore wetting membrane distillation optical coherence tomography oct early monitoring scaling 1 introduction membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process that uses a microporous hydrophobic membrane to realize the separation of water and non volatile solutes e g salts chang et al 2021 horseman et al 2021 this process with the usage of low grade energy is promising for hypersaline water desalination xu et al 2022 wastewater treatment yan et al 2023 zhong et al 2021 and resource recovery naidu et al 2020 during the operation of md membrane pore wetting i e the formation of liquid passages in hydrophobic pores can lead to serious losses of solute rejection horseman et al 2021 to recover the rejection complex cleaning and drying operations are required abdel karim et al 2021 rezaei et al 2018b therefore membrane wetting is a major obstacle to the widespread application of md horseman et al 2021 the pore wetting could be regarded as the progressive advancement of a water vapor interface from the pore entrance to the distillate side ultimately resulting in the complete filling of the hydrophobic pore horseman et al 2021 according to the previous studies surfactant and scaling are the two main reasons for wetting chang et al 2021 rezaei et al 2018a for the surfactant induced wetting the surfactant may reduce the surface tension of feed solution and decrease the hydrophobicity of membranes shao et al 2022 wang et al 2018 thereby promoting pore wetting for the scaling induced wetting the continuous growth of crystals e g gypsum christie et al 2020 or repeated dissolution crystallization of crystals e g nacl shi et al 2022 in hydrophobic pores lead to the propagation of water vapor interfaces and the subsequent filling of the hydrophobic pores generally wetting is not an instantaneous process and the total duration may last for several days when treating actual wastewater choudhury et al 2019 if one can take timely detection at the beginning of wetting i e the time when the water vapor interface just leaves the entrance of pores it may have chance to prevent the formation of full liquid passages and thus avoid the failure of solute rejection therefore early monitoring of wetting is highly desirable for a membrane pore the wetting process could be classified into three stages unwetted fully wetted and transition states semi wetting stage horseman et al 2021 jacob et al 2020 when the membrane pore is in the semi wetting stage it is difficult to identify by observeing the change in distillate water conductivity due to the continued presence of air gaps in the membrane pore however studying the semi wetting stage has significant implications for understanding the mechanism of membrane wetting and for early warning of membrane wetting gong et al 2023 shi et al 2023 to date researchers have employed various approaches to investigate the wetting in the membrane pores in md process including the use of regular geometric structures as models chamani et al 2020 2022 qtaishat et al 2022 rana et al 2022 as well as in situ online characterization and monitoring tools in an attempt to gain a more intuitive understanding of the wetting process bauer et al 2019 chen et al 2017 jacob et al 2020 luo et al 2023 however due to the different pore structures and diversity of substances involved in wetting process no unified mechanism of pore wetting in md is establish currently and additional membrane wetting monitoring technologies are still needed according to the previous studies in situ techniques for the early monitoring of membrane wetting include transmembrane impedance chen et al 2017 deka et al 2021 wong et al 2022 light transmittance jacob et al 2020 kim et al 2019 optical coherence tomography oct bauer et al 2019 liu et al 2021b shao et al 2022 etc the transmembrane impedance is based on the principle that the impedance decreases during the wetting process i e the reduction in the length of unwetted pores or air gaps with pre embedded electrodes in md modules the decrease in transmembrane impedance could be regarded as the early signal of wetting occurrence chen et al 2017 while the detailed wetting spots cannot be detected the light transmittance is based on the increase in the light transmittance of a membrane with the advancement of the water vapor interface kim et al 2019 oct is based on the reflection of light from the wetting layer and the water vapor interface which can perform optical imaging on the wetting layer in real time shao et al 2022 as optical based methods light transmittance and oct can only be used in transparent md modules which may only be available in the laboratory therefore novel strategies that can realize non invasive and early monitoring of membrane wetting are still needed ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr technique uses the ultrasonic echo of an interface with a high ultrasonic reflexivity li et al 2017 mairal et al 1999 qiu et al 2022 with the time of flight tof of the ultrasound i e the time from a pulse ultrasound sending to the corresponding echo receiving the location of the interface could be detected utdr technique has been successfully applied to investigate the thickness of fouling and scaling layers in membrane based processes cai et al 2011 lai et al 2020 li et al 2014 mairal et al 2000 sim et al 2012 due to the big difference in acoustic impedance between water and air z water 2 13 106 kg m2 s and z air 414 kg m2 s more acoustic impedance information is shown in table s1 the ultrasonic wave could be strongly reflected at a water vapor interface making it possible to track the movement of water vapor interface during wetting therefore the utdr technique may have the potential to realize the early monitoring and warning of pore wetting in this study the utdr technique was applied to monitor the pore wetting in a direct contact md we established the relationship between wetting stages and the utdr waveforms with the help of wetting layers imaging by an oct system based on this relationship we successfully used utdr to realize the early monitoring of wetting induced by a surfactant and a salt scaling this study highlights that utdr could non invasively detect the water vapor interface in md thereby realizing early monitoring of membrane wetting 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and

transparent plexiglass with an effective membrane area of 1 5 6 cm2 fig s1 the temperature of the feed stream was controlled at 60 c by a digital hot plate magnetic agitator rct digital ika germany and the temperature of the distillate stream was maintained at 20 c by a cooler dc0510 cnshp china two gear pumps wt3000 1jb longer china were used to circulate the feed and distillate the crossflow velocity of the feed stream 12 cm s was slightly higher than that of the distillate stream 8 cm s to minimize the vibration of the membrane we cushioned a spacer at the distillate side liu et al 2021a and made the water pressure of the feed stream slightly higher than that of the distillate stream a digital balance ah a3002g anheng china and a conductivity meter sin tds310 sinomeasure china were used to timely monitor the weight and conductivity of the distillate respectively the obtained weight and conductivity data were used to calculate the flux and salt rejection 2 3 experiment of surfactant and scaling induced wetting before the wetting experiment the flux of the md system was stabilized in the experiment of surfactant induced wetting nacl solution 3 5 wt was used as a background solution of the feed and triton x 100 was added into the feed solution to achieve a concentration of 100 mg l in the experiment of scaling induced wetting the feed solution was prepared by mixing 25 mmol l of na2so4 and 25 mmol l of cacl2 with a gypsum saturation index of 1 6 2 4 optical coherence tomography oct observation in an oct the infrared light from a light emitter is divided into two beams one beam is emitted to a sample and the other beam as reference light interferes with the light reflected by the sample the cross sectional image of the sample can be obtained by processing these optical signals in this study an oct gan220c1 thorlab usa with a scanning lens oct lk3 bb thorlabs usa was used to observe the membrane wetting in the md system fig 1 axial and lateral resolutions of the oct system were 3 μm and 8 μm respectively the change in pixel brightness of the cross sectional images was used to analyze the wetting depth shao et al 2022 2 5 ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr monitoring system the utdr monitoring system contained a pulse transceiver cts 8077pr shantou ultrasonic china a transducer 10 mhz 10p10 shantou ultrasonic china and a digital oscilloscope rigol 2016r rigol china fig 1 the castor oil was used as the coupling agent filling the gap between the ultrasonic probe and the membrane module interface to closely contact the top surface of md cell the pulse transceiver sent an electrical signal to the transducer which transformed the signal into an ultrasonic wave with a frequency of 10 mhz once the ultrasonic passed an interface between two media with distinct acoustic impedances an ultrasonic echo was generated the ultrasonic echo could be received by the transducer then sent back to the pulse transceiver and finally received by the oscilloscope the waveform of the echo could be displayed by the screen of oscilloscope in real time the data of echo were analyzed through jupyterlab version 3 3 2 2 6 calculation of the displacement and acoustic properties of an interface displacement of an interface δ l could be calculated by the sound velocity v and the change of tof δ t 1 δ l v δ t 2 where δl is the calculated displacement of a certain interface δt is the variation of tof with operation time and v is the sound velocity of the medium passed by the ultrasound in the case that the medium is a homogeneous mixture of k substance v can be obtained as follows jones 1949 2 1 v i 1 k α i v i where v i and α i are the sound velocity and volume percentage of the ith substance in the mixture respectively the reflection coefficient rr was used to quantitatively analyze the amplitude of the reflected waveform relative to the incident wave the transmission coefficient rt was used to quantitatively analyze the amplitude of the transmitted waveform relative to the incident wave both coefficients are related to the acoustic impedance z of the media on both sides of the interface which can be calculated according to the following equations 3 r r z i 1 z i z i 1 z i 4 r t 2 z i 1 z i 1 z i where zi and zi 1 represent the acoustic impedances of the medium at the incident side and the transmission side of an interface respectively according to eq 3 the calculated reflection coefficient of a water vapor interface reaches rr 0 9995 due to the great difference in acoustic impedance between water and air while the transmission coefficient is only rt 0 0005 mainly owing to the low acoustic impedance of air supporting information provides more information about related interface such as water pvdf interface water membrane interface wetting layer unwetting layer interface which are convenient to better understand the mechanism for the variation of echo table s2 if a medium is a uniform mixture of different substance the acoustic impedance can be calculated as follows 5 z i 1 k ρ i α i i 1 k α i v i where ρi represents the density of the ith substance in the homogeneous media for example for a pvdf membrane with a porosity of 0 75 in surfactant induced wetting the calculated value of the acoustic impedance of the wetting layer and unwetted layer are zwet

wetting is a dynamic process and its ultrasonic signal varied in different wetting stages therefore we analyzed the echo waveforms of typical wetting stages to better understand the dynamic changes in the echo signals during the development of wetting unwetted membrane the water vapor interface of an unwetted membrane coincides with the membrane surface fig 2 a 1 and consequently the oct image only

wetting membrane which is featured by a water vapor interface nearly parallel to the membrane surface the homogeneous semi wetting could be caused by high concentration surfactants or highly soluble

bands where the upper one represents the membrane surface and the lower one means the water vapor interface the displacement of the water vapor interface separating from the membrane surface results in the delay of tof δ t i e the right shift of the waveform fig 2c 2 with the ultrasonic velocity in the wetting layer calculated by eq 2 it is possible to obtain the depth of the wetting layer according to eq 1 fig 2a 3 shows an inhomogeneous semi wetting stage compared with the homogeneous semi wetting fig 2a 2 2b 2 this type of semi wetting is characterized by uneven wetting depths the echo waveform fig 2c 3 can be regarded as the superposition of echoes of water vapor interfaces at different wetting depths the phase shift may be regarded as an average of different wetting depths the amplitude of fig 2c 3 is lower than that of fig 2b 2 as a result of the more dissipation and interference of echoes induced by the inhomogeneous water vapor interface fully wetted membrane at this wetting stage water fills membrane pores with the disappearance of the water vapor interface fig 2a 4 therefore only the membrane feed solution interface and the membrane distillate solution interface could reflect ultrasound however both interfaces have a poor reflection of ultrasound rr 0 18 see fig s2 for detailed calculation leading to such a low amplitude of the waveform fig 2c 4 this weak echo of water membrane interface has little interference on the echo of water vapor interface making it possible to monitor the water vapor interface with the utdr method scaling layer on a fully wetted membrane in scaling induced wetting a scaling layer can form on the membrane surface the echo reflected by the water crystal interface may interfere with the echo of the water vapor interface to investigate the ultrasonic reflection of scaling layers we investigated the echo waveform fig 2c 5 of the scaling layer on a fully wetted membrane fig 2b 5 because the water crystal interface is closer to the transducer the tof of the echo reduced resulting in the left shifted waveform due to the weak reflection of the water crystal interface table s2 the amplitude of the echo waveform reflected by the scaling layer is low fig 2c 5 suggesting a low influence of the scaling layer on the detection of the water vapor interface 3 2 monitoring surfactant induced wetting dynamics with

membrane pore was completely wetted at the 9th min fig 3b 4 the amplitude of the echo signal significantly decreased fig 3a with the disappearance of the water vapor interface which has a strong reflection to ultrasonic in the oct images fig 3b the wetting depth could be obtained by measuring the distance between the membrane surface and the water vapor interface shao et al 2022 for the utdr echo fig 3a the wetting depth could also be calculated by the change in tof and sound velocity eq 1 fig 3c compares the wetting depth obtained by utdr and oct techniques both sets of data were near

propagation of wetting interfaces in a surfactant induced wetting experiment the dynamic variation of wetting depth obtained by utdr is shown in fig 4 the addition of surfactant resulted in an immediate propagation of the water vapor interface while the vapor flux and distillate conductivity were unchanged until some of the membrane pores were completely wetted after a few minutes thus we could realize early monitoring of surfactant induced wetting by investigating the variation of tof and amplitude of echo waveforms of the utdr which could avoid fully wetting of membranes 3 3 monitoring gypsum induced wetting dynamics with utdr when the feed solution contained 25 mmol l of caso4 gypsum crystal would soon deposit on the membrane surface and form an inhomogeneous scaling

scaling layer the echo waveform slightly shifted left at the beginning figs 2c 1 2c 5 and 5a around the 40th minute however the waveform began to shift right this could be explained by the thickening of the scaling layer accompanied by scaling induced inhomogeneous semi wetting gryta 2005 rezaei et al 2018b causing the water vapor interface to move away from the transducer around the 40th minute the right shift of the waveform caused by wetting surpassed the left shift of the waveform caused by scaling layer the corresponding oct images 40th minute fig 5b 3 also indicated that the membrane

provide an early warning of scaling induced wetting 3 4 implications for the early monitoring of wetting using utdr because the strong ultrasonic reflection at the water vapor interface and the relatively weak ultrasonic reflection at the water membrane interface fig 2 we successful used the utdr technique to monitor the wetting dynamics in an md according to figs 3 6 both for surfactant induced and scaling induced wetting the echo waveforms experienced the reduction of amplitude and the right shift of waveform at the beginning of wetting therefore when the amplitude of utdr signal decreases and the waveform shifts right it is possible that the membrane has undergone pore wetting since no fully wetting occurs at this time we can still prevent the further development of wetting through the strategies such as pretreatment and chemical cleaning deshmukh et al 2018 guillen burrieza et al 2014 although utdr technique has been used to monitor the membrane fouling and scaling in membrane processes to the best of our knowledge it has not been used for wetting detection in md compared with membrane fouling and scaling membrane wetting is different in terms of principles and occurrence position membrane surface vs membrane interior kiefer et al 2019 and therefore our study may extend the application of utdr as a type of non invasive real time and in situ method for wetting detection in md utdr technique can directly place the probe on the out wall of the membrane module ultrasonic based measurement is well developed in many applications and thus the wetting detection with utdr may have a high potential for scale up due to the different wetting speeds at different positions in the membrane module the probe can be placed at the position where wetting is more likely to occur such as the inlet of the membrane module luo et al 2023 however there remains considerable scope for improving the accuracy and sensitivity of ultrasonic technologies in particular the detection of the inner membrane of the spring wound membrane module is an ongoing challenge that requires further investigation and optimization 4 conclusion in this study we found utdr could effectively detect the water vapor interface in md and successfully used utdr to analyze the dynamic of wetting induced by triton x 100 and gypsum the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the water vapor interface showed a strong reflection of ultrasonic while the water membrane and water crystal interface showed relatively weak reflections therefore utdr could effectively detect the water vapor interface in md 2 when surfactant induced wetting occurred the amplitude of utdr waveforms decreased and its phase shifted right according to the change in tof and the ultrasonic velocity the wetting depths of a homogeneous wetting could be accurately measured 3 in gypsum scaling induced wetting the growth of scaling layer could interfere the echo of water vapor interface leading to a slightly decrease in tof at the beginning 0 30 min however the strong signal of wetting quickly surpassed the interference of scaling layer leading to a continuous increase in tof 4 the decrease in amplitude and increase in tof could be used as early monitoring signals for pore wetting in md declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14723,resources recovery from landfill leachate lfl has been attracting growing attention instead of merely purifying the wastewater an integrated two stage membrane distillation itmd was proposed to simultaneously purify lfl and recover ammonia in this study the results showed that organics could be always effectively rejected by the itmd regardless of varying feed ph with cod removal higher than 99 with feed ph increased from 8 64 to 12 the ammonia migration 50 100 and capture 36 75 in lfl were considerably enhanced boosting the separated ammonia enrichment to 1 3 1 7 times due to the improved ammonium diffusion however the corresponding membrane flux of the first md stage decreased from 13 7 to 10 5 l m2 h elevating feed ph caused the deprotonation of nom and its binding with inorganic ions constituting a complex fouling layer on the membrane surface in the first md stage in contrast the membrane permeability and fouling of the second md were not affected by feed ph adjustment because only volatiles passed through the first md more importantly it was estimated that itmd could obtain high quality water and recover high purity ammonium from lfl with relatively low ammonium concentration at an input cost of 2 3 m3 which was very competitive with existing techniques these results demonstrated that the itmd can be a valuable candidate strategy for simultaneous water purification and nutrient recovery from landfill leachate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords landfill leachate integrated two stage membrane distillation itmd ammonium recovery membrane fouling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sanitary landfill is still the most common municipal solid waste disposal approach owing to its ease of operation and cost effectiveness luo et al 2020 however the landfill process inevitably generates waste landfill leachate lfl which concentrates large amounts of hazardous pollutants including natural organic matter nom ammonium and heavy metals inappropriate treatment or disposal of lfl would always lead to grievous pollution to soil aquatic environment and even the ecological cycle yan et al 2022 hence it is of great challenge to purify the lfl to meet wastewater discharge or reuse requirements low biodegradability and high ammonium are prominent characteristics of lfl which makes conventional biological chemical or physicochemical treatments inadequate for lfl purification luo et al 2020 shao et al 2021 therefore various new and hybrid processes were proposed to fulfill this target pre oxidation associated with membrane separation has been widely reported for the deep purification of lfl aftab et al 2020 chen et al 2020 ye et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 the combinations of fenton ozonation with nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro membranes achieved satisfactory retention of humic substance 95 7 and salt 94 7 for lfl treatment ye et al 2019 large amounts of oxidants are required to efficiently degrade the high concentration nom in lfl chen et al 2020 besides the high pressure membrane processes i e nf and ro employed may undermine the economic feasibility aftab et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 moreover these processes could hardly recover valuable resources from the lfl incompatible with resource recycling and sustainable water industry ammonium in the lfl reaches 1000 3000 mg l which could be a valuable and recoverable resource lin et al 2013 the synthetic ammonia industry could be highly energy intensive and thus ammonium recovery would contribute to recycling economy and sustainable development he et al 2018 many technologies have been investigated for ammonium removal and recovery such as stripping nitrification denitrification and struvite precipitation zarebska et al 2014 but the ammonia recovery efficiencies or the costs of the above approaches were not satisfactory stripping could achieve only 71 ammonia removal when treating animal slurries ledda et al 2013 when treating wastewater the anammox process gained 69 3 ammonia removal lin et al 2016 struvite precipitation obtained 95 9 ammonia removal from municipal solid waste leachate treatment however large amounts of magnesium and phosphate were required escalating the application costs gu et al 2019 mavhungu et al 2021 accordingly a new technique is yet to be developed for effective ammonium recovery and water purification in wastewater treatment membrane distillation md a thermal driven process based on the principles of gas liquid equilibrium and heat mass transfer has attracted extensive attention recently drioli et al 2015 shirazi et al 2014 yan et al 2019a md can effectively retain non volatile pollutants with a hydrophobic microporous membrane as the separation medium only water vapor and gas can flow along the vapor pressure gradient direction into the distillate side more importantly there is a free conversion between ammonium and ammonia at temperatures and ph values adopted in the md application thus md is a prospective scheme for ammonium recovery qi et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 zico et al 2021 a previous study applied vacuum membrane distillation vmd to treat ro brine and an ideal and stable flux 3 l m2 h was obtained at a vacuum pressure of 0 08 mpa qi et al 2015 because md is a thermal driven membrane process the vapor flux of md is seldom affected by the salinity and the membrane exhibits higher resistance to membrane fouling than pressure driven membrane processes yan et al 2021b besides both nom and ammonium were reported to be effectively retained 98 during lfl treatment by forward osmosis fo combined with the md process zhou et al 2017 generally md has multiple advantages in operation pollutant separation and potential resource recovery zhou et al 2017 zico et al 2021 nevertheless the investigations on lfl treatment by md are performed mainly by setting md as the post processing for other membrane technologies applying solar powered one stage direct contact membrane distillation dcmd to lfl could remove ammonium by adjusting the feed ph to 5 however the ammonium removal rate was less than 59 yan et al 2021a zico et al 2021 hence the md is promising in ammonium recovery and water purification in lfl treatment but the process is yet to be ameliorated to allow better technical and economic feasibility accordingly an integrated two stage membrane distillation itmd with first stage md for ammonium extraction and second stage for ammonium concentration was proposed in this work and its performance for lfl treatment was investigated since the protonation and deprotonation of nom and ammonium in the lfl highly depend on the ph the effects of feed ph on pollutants rejection ammonium recovery and membrane fouling were evaluated the main objectives of this study are i to elucidate effects of feed ph on performance of ammonium recovery and nom removal ii to study characteristics and mechanisms of complex membrane fouling caused by co deposition of ammonium and nom iii to assess feasibility and economic benefits of the itmd for deep lfl treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of actual lfl real concentrated lfl was used as the feed water in the study the feed water was collected from the equalization tank at the landfill in shenzhen southern china the physicochemical properties of the lfl are presented in table 1 the average ammonium concentration of the lfl was 930 58 mg l implying a high potential of ammonium recovery the chemical oxygen demand cod and uv254 were 1291 83 mg l and 2 714 cm 1 respectively indicating a high risk of membrane fouling during lfl treatment using membrane technology 2 2 itmd system and membrane properties an itmd reactor was constructed in this study the itmd reactor consisted of two md membranes a temperature regulation system and an online monitoring system as illustrated in fig 1 two dcmd units were stacked in series namely the md 1 and md 2 three water channels were connected to the reactor namely the first intermediate and last channels the first channel enabled the separation and diffusion of ammonia the intermediate channel achieved the concentration and recovery of ammonium and the third channel obtained pure water specifically lfl was first pumped into the feed chamber of md 1 where sodium hydroxide was used to adjust the feed ph to enhance ammonia diffusion and increase ammonium concentration in the primary distillate md 1 distillate afterward the primary distillate was acidified by sulfuric acid to retain and concentrate the ammonium meanwhile only water vapor passed through the md 2 and thus high quality water could be obtained the electronic balances were used to measure the flux variation of the primary distillate continuously two microporous hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hydrophobic membranes x1020 suzhouminglie china with a surface area of 25 cm2 5 cm 5 cm were used in both md 1 and md 2 trade offs between distillate flux and pore wetting risk were made using hydrophobic membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 22 µm consistent with the pore size 0 16 0 5 µm commonly used in md processes alkhatib et al 2021 the water contact angle and thickness of the membrane were 120 and 200 μm respectively to keep the consistency of the repeated distillation tests the clean water distillation flux of the membranes was determined prior to the experiments and ptfe hydrophobic membranes with similar distillate fluxes were selected 2 3 experimental procedure to ensure consistency across all operating scenarios prefiltration of landfill leachate with a 0 45 μm membrane glass fiber haining china was adopted to remove suspended particles thereafter four feed ph levels of 8 64 10 11 and 12 were set up in md 1 and adjusted by 1 m l sodium hydroxide diluted sulfuric acid 2 78 mm l was introduced in the distillate side of md 1 for ammonium recovery in the first channel 2000 ml of leachate concentrate was circulated at 60 c at a flow rate of 300 ml min on the feed side of md 1 in the intermediate channel 1000 ml of diluted sulfuric acid solution was dispersed at 45 c at 400 ml min flow rate in the distillate side of md 1 which was also the feed side of md 2 in the last channel 1000 ml of ultrapure water was circulated at 20 c at a flow rate of 300 ml min on the distillate side of md 2 no additional prefiltration was used when the feed ph was changed in different scenarios in consideration of parallelity during the membrane distillation process the itmd system was initially run on a trial basis for 30 mins to stabilize the system data were not recorded the distillation process was then operated in triplicate for 30 consecutive hours 2 4 analytical methods removal of organics in lfl by the itmd system was assessed in terms of cod and uv254 cod was determined by a fast digestion spectrophotometric method using a cod digester drb200 hach usa and a spectrophotometer dr 2800 hach usa mei et al 2017 uv254 was determined by a uv visible spectrophotometer t6 pu analysis china ammonium was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry zitomer and lambert 1962 turbidity was measured by a turbidity meter hi98703 hanna italy conductivity and ph were determined by a conductivity meter ddsj 308f remagnetics china and a portable ph meter pb 10 sartorius german respectively ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm for solutions preparation and vessel washing was produced by a milli q purification system millipore bedford ma usa all samples were measured in triplicate and the reagents used were of analytical grade the membrane fouling and elemental composition were observed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometer analysis sem eds tescan mira lms tescan czech republic the fouled membrane samples were successively cleaned with pure water and chemicals submerged in 1 m l hydrochloric acid and 1 m l sodium hydroxide for 2 h then samples were characterized by the sem eds to evaluate the reversible and irreversible membrane fouling before observation samples were sprayed with a thin layer of platinum to increase the conductivity fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet is50 thermo usa was used to analyze the functional group compositions of the fouling layer purity of the recovered ammonium sulphate was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd 18 kw miniflex 600 rigaku japan the samples were scanned within 2θ of 10 70 using 1 54 å cu kα x rays at a rate of 0 02 deg s fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem was employed to determine the organic composition of the distillate using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf6000 shimadzu japan excitation and emission wavelengths of electroluminescence were set at 200 450 nm at an interval of 2 nm and 250 550 nm at an interval of 5 nm respectively the samples were diluted to uv254 0 05 cm 1 to eliminate the inner filter effect yu et al 2020a a pure water control group was set up to eliminate raman scattering by water yan et al 2021a 2 5 membrane flux and ammonium recovery efficiency calculation during the experiment the weight of the distillate was measured by an electronic balance bt224s sartorius german and the data were automatically recorded on a personal computer at an interval of 5 min the operating efficiency of the system was analyzed by calculating actual flux j and specific flux j j0 yan et al 2021a specifically j0 denotes the initial flux of ultrapure water filtered by the virgin membrane and j denotes the final flux after filtering the feed water the final flux j can be calculated as shown in eq 1 qu et al 2013 1 j v p a t where j is the distillate flux v p is the overflow volume of distillate t is the time interval a is the effective membrane area the ammonia recovery efficiency r n h 3 residue ammonia in the feed tank r e n h 3 ammonia loss l n h 3 and ammonia concentration ratio during the itmd process was calculated as shown in eqs 2 5 respectively xu and he 2021 2 r n h 3 c p n h 3 v p c f 0 n h 3 v f 0 100 where c p n h 3 and v p are the ammonia concentration in the permeate tank and the total permeate volume at the time when the sample was taken c f 0 n h 3 and v f 0 are the initial ammonia concentration and initial feed volume 3 r e

the itmd system the free ammonia can be stripped by transfer from liquid to gas thus the concentration ratio of the ammonia in the intermediate channel to ammonium in the feed solution is a major factor in evaluating the ammonia concentration efficiency of itmd defined as the ammonia concentration ratio c c n h 3 and estimated as follows 5 c cn h 3 c i n h 3 c f 0 n h 3 where c i n h 3 is the ammonia concentration in the intermediate channel the ammonia ammonium distribution in the solution was calculated as shown in eqs 6 9 quinn et al 1992 6 δ n h 3 o h k b o h k a k a h 7 δ nh 4 k b k b

treatment by itmd in terms of ammonium concentration at various ph values is shown in fig 2 with increasing feed ph ammonium concentration on the feed side exhibited an overall decreasing trend fig 2a with no ph adjustment ph 8 64 the ammonium diffusion of md 1 feed side was relatively slow after a 30 h operation ammonium in the md 1 feed side was partially reduced from 932 to 780 mg l and the ammonium entered the intermediate channel was effectively concentrated with the ammonia concentration ratio of 1 2 fig 2b when the feed ph was adjusted to 10 11 and 12 ammonium concentrations in the md 1 feed side were reduced to 592 mg l 392 mg l and 5 mg l respectively correspondingly ammonium in the md 1 distillate reached 1236 mg l 1373 mg l and 1560 mg l corresponding to the ammonia concentration ratios of 1 3 1 5 and 1 7 respectively it is indicated that increasing feed ph significantly enhanced ammonia diffusion consistent with the result obtained in a previous study zico et al 2021 increasing feed ph would cause deprotonation of ammonium driving the conversion of ammonium to ammonia qu et al 2013 therefore ammonium in the lfl could be extracted efficiently besides the recovery efficiency was affected by distillation time and long term operation would highlight the discrepancy in the recovery efficiency fig 2c presents amounts of captured lost and residual ammoniums it can be observed that the ultimate percentage of separated ammonium in the lfl reached 50 after 30 h operation without ph adjustment however only 36 of the ammonium in the lfl was captured by md 1 corresponding to an ammonium loss of 14 in contrast elevating feed ph to 10 11 and 12 significantly reduced the residual ammonium in the feed lfl to 30 17 and 0 respectively in other words ammonium separation reached almost 100 at the feed ph of 12 and ammonium capture was raised to 75 this is consistence with the previous study which reported 84 2 ammonia recovery at ph 12 xu and he 2021 lost ammonia increased from 14 to 25 when the feed ph increased from 8 64 to 12 which might be owing to ammonia volatilization to the atmosphere besides no ammonium was detected in the md 2 distillate in addition ammonium was not detected in the md 2 distillate of the third channel at a feed water ph of 12 this result indicated that increasing the feed ph improved the ammonia recovery efficiency and the quality of distillate water in conclusion elevating feed ph to 12 had a more significant compensatory benefit in improving the separation and subsequent capture of ammonium in the lfl treatment by itmd the ammonia and ammonium balance in an aqueous solution is displayed in fig 2d the transformation of ammonium to ammonia in water is mainly influenced by acid base equilibrium of ammonium the interconversion of free and fixed ammonium henry s law from ammonium to ammonia transmembrane separation of ammonia and adsorption and immobilization of acid solution quinn et al 1992 according to the distribution fraction of conjugate acid base pairs of monobasic weak bases the calculated equilibrium between the atmospheric gas and particle phases was attained at a ph of 9 3 based on ammonia dissociate equilibration in an aqueous solution elevating the feed ph of md 1 facilitated more conversion of dissolved ammonium into gaseous ammonia subsequently ammonia could penetrate across md 1 along the water vapor gradient to achieve ammonium recovery moreover md was operated at a high temperature which could reduce ammonium dissolution in the water and benefit ammonia recovery zoungrana et al 2020 however in all cases the ammonium in the feed water decreased significantly within the first 6 h and the decreasing rate gradually slowed until the experiment was completed as the distillation process proceeded ammonium in the lfl gradually decreased according to fick s law the diffusion coefficient d at different feed ph conditions was not varying wildly si therefore it is likely that the decrease in the ammonium pressure gradient weakened the driving force of ammonium conversion to ammonia resulting in slowed ammonia migration in md 1 as the ph of the second channel was adjusted from 8 64 to 12 the concentration of ammonium in the third channel remained undetected indicating effective ammonium recovery and water purification 3 2 effects of feed ph on nom rejection in itmd system fig 3 presents nom rejections during lfl treatment using the itmd system it can be observed in fig 3a that the cod concentrations of the md 1 distillates were 27 1 25 8 22 6 and 15 1 mg l at feed ph 8 64 10 11 and 12 respectively corresponding cod removal rates eventually reached 97 9 98 1 98 2 and 98 8 fig 3b the result indicates that the md 1 was very efficient in nom rejection regardless of feed ph values however there was a small amount of volatile compounds in lfl resulting in occurrence of some organics in md 1 distillate a similar result was observed in a one stage dcmd system where 96 nom rejection was achieved in rubber processing effluent treatment mokhtar et al 2015 the cod concentration of md 2 distillate decreased with increasing feed ph at ph levels of 8 64 10 11 and 12 the cod concentrations of md 2 distillates were 6 02 4 52 3 15 and 0 52 mg l respectively the cod removal rates by itmd were over 99 5 in all scenarios higher than those of md 1 97 9 98 1 98 2 and 98 8 suggesting that md 2 could further retain the residual nom in the primary distillate the feed ph increase noticeably enhanced cod removal and absolute rejection of nom was achieved at the feed ph of 12 a possible reason is that the volatile organic compounds in the lfl were primarily volatile acids which would be retained in alkaline solution yan et al 2019b eem analysis of the distillates was performed to further assess the removal of organic components from the lfl by itmd as illustrated in fig 3c the fluorescence spectra are generally classified into five regions according to chemical composition zone i ex em 220 250 nm 280 330 nm and zone ii ex em 220 250 nm 330 380 nm represent aromatic protein substances zone iii ex em 220 250 nm 380 550 nm represents fulvic acid substances zone iv ex em 250 440 nm 280 380 nm represents soluble microbial products smps and zone v ex em 250 450 nm 380 550 nm represents humic substances respectively yu et al 2020b the results showed that small amounts of smp like substances were present in the md 1 distillate suggesting that adsorption desorption diffusion processes of organics may exist at the membrane gas surface interface smps could adsorb to the ptfe membrane surface through net particle surface interaction meanwhile carboxylic acids contained in volatile organic compounds would diffuse from the feed side to distillate side along the direction of vapor gradient through hydrogen bonding with water tijing et al 2015 the pollutants fluorescence intensity in both distillates decreased with the increasing feed ph supporting the assumption that ph affected the hydrolysis and functional group characteristics of nom another study on lfl treatment by md reported that elevating feed ph enhanced deprotonated organic inorganic complexation yan et al 2022 the fluorescence intensity of residual nom was significantly reduced in md 2 distillate demonstrating that the secondary membrane distillation effectively retained organic matter which coincided with the high cod rejection rate it has been reported that the second stage md further purified the effluent of the first stage md shi et al 2022 consistent with the results obtained in this study table s1 3 3 membrane flux and fouling in the itmd system the vapor fluxes of the itmd system at different ph values are displayed in fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4a the md 1 distillate flux decreased continuously at each ph condition as the feed ph increased from 8 64 to 10 11 and 12 the final distillate fluxes of md 1 decreased from around 11 l m2 h to 9 2 8 2 and 7 8 l m2 h respectively interestingly adjusting ph from 8 64 to 12 reduced the initial distillate flux by a quarter from 13 7 to 10 5 l m2 h the insoluble metal hydroxides e g ca oh 2 ca5 po4 3oh and mg oh 2 may be formed in the ph adjustment and they may further co precipitate with humic substance fig s1 similar results were reported in the study of membrane electrochemical reactor combined with membrane distillation mer md for lfl treatment where oh generated in the cathode chamber of mer reacted with ca2 and mg2 to form precipitates yan et al 2023 because there was a 30 min stabilization period for the itmd system co precipitates may be partially formed and reduced initial flux during the subsequent 2 3 h of membrane distillation co precipitates continued precipitating which may deposit on the membrane surface and deteriorate the distillate flux in addition md is a thermal driven process to achieve the separation of foulants from water fouling of the membrane surface caused by pressure gradients which occurs in conventional pressure driven membrane filtration processes does not occur in the md process el bourawi et al 2006 therefore the water purification efficiency and water production performance of the md process are much more stable in accordance with the consistency of distillate fluxes in triplicate md tests by contrast to membrane fouling special flux could reflect the impact of membrane fouling on permeate flux in real time in fig 4c the final specific flux decreased slightly to 0 85 for ph 8 64 and 10 groups the specific flux dropped more drastically in ph 11 and 12 groups this result indicated that an appropriate elevation in feed ph could retard flux decline however extremely high ph may severely compromise the vapor flux due to fouling the moderate alkalinity in the feed may allow mild aggregation of ha and inorganic metals the aggregates may form a relatively porous fouling layer on the membrane surface preventing the subsequent foulants from accessing the membrane pores it is reported that an excessive increase in ph might cause severe inorganic matter aggregation and hydrolysis of ha to generate carboxyl groups warsinger et al 2015 yan et al 2021a ions could bind with carboxyl groups reducing electrostatic repulsion between the organics and the membrane surface curcio et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 resulting in faster specific flux reduction to concentrate ammonium an appropriate amount of sulfuric acid was intermittently added to the md 1 distillate to transform ammonium into ammonium sulfate which cannot penetrate the md 2 hence the ph values of md 1 distillates were kept in the range of 5 58 6 32 table s1 for md 2 the feed ph did not significantly affect the actual vapor flux and specific flux owing to the satisfactory foulants rejection achieved by md 1 only water vapor and a small portion of the volatiles penetrated the md 2 resulting in a neutral condition of the md 2 distillate the ph values of md 2 distillates were in the range of 7 44 7 56 regardless of feed ph table s1 the slight flux reduction of md 2 might be due to the crystallization of concentrated ammonium salts on the membrane surface this result was consistent with the inorganic crystallization of calcium and magnesium during lfl treatment using dcmd yan et al 2021a 3 4 membrane autopsy and elemental composition of fouled membranes the morphological properties of the membrane surface and cross section are shown in the sem images fig 5 it can be observed that a large amount of foulants deposited on the surface of membranes in md 1 after a 30 hours operation fig 5 1 4a however the fouling coverage and morphology figs s2 and s3 of fouled membranes varied significantly as the feed ph changed at the feed ph 8 64 the foulants were dispersed and covered the membrane surface over a large area besides the aggregation of foulants on the membrane surface was strengthened as feed ph increased in particular the foulants tightly packed on the membrane surface after the feed ph increased to 11 the fouling layer showed a complete plate structure at feed ph 12 complexation and cross linking of inorganic ions with nom might cause dense co deposition on the membrane surface as supported by elemental mapping calcium carbon oxygen phosphorus and sulphur were widely distributed on the fouled membrane surface this result is consistent with the increased cod rejection and the decrease in distillation flux at elevated feed ph during lfl treatment by itmd furthermore fine crystalline particles of inorganic ions could be observed in the cross section of the membrane in md 1 fig 5 2 4b similarly in a study on the ammonia recovery from palladium leachate by dcmd inorganic crystals were found to cross link nom on the membrane surface resulting in severe membrane fouling and further inducing membrane wetting hu et al 2022 in md 2 the fouling layer was significantly reduced compared to md 1 fig s3 consistent with moderate flux reduction the efficient retention of nom and inorganic ions by md 1 was the underlying reason for the relatively less fouling of md 2 in fig 5c only a small amount of residual foulants was observed on the membrane surface after cleaning indicating that the fouling was reversible in all ph cases in conclusion the high ph exacerbated membrane fouling but the fouling in all cases was quite recoverable by cleaning the element compositions of the fouling layer and pristine membranes are shown in table s2 only carbon 38 40 and fluorine 61 60 were detected on the pristine ptfe membrane at the feed ph of 8 64 the fouling layer was dominated by carbon 26 82 and oxygen 35 12 the presence of oxygen indicated the deposition of nom on the membrane surface while a mild decrease in carbon content may be due to the organics covering the ptfe membrane similarly the low percentage of fluorine detected at feed ph 8 64 and 10 11 and 12 may be attributed to the shielding of the membrane surface by the fouling layer besides many inorganic elements including silicon calcium magnesium and phosphorus were observed in ftir spectra indicating the occurrence of inorganic scaling on the membrane surface the ratio of calcium composition increased from 15 30 to 39 76 along with the increase of feed ph from 8 64 to 12 this was consistent with previous studies which reported that increasing feed ph enhanced the complexation of calcium with nom on the membrane surface yan et al 2022 besides the complexation deposition was identified as the main causative factor for membrane fouling resulting in deteriorated distillate quality as reflected by increased conductivity the conductivity of md 2 distillates at four feed ph values showed no significant increase indicating that no membrane wetting occurred in md 2 fig s4 this could also be supported by the efficient rejection of organic and other constituents in the md 2 table s3 generally the itmd showed excellent lfl treatment performance and great long term operation potential the functional group characteristics of the fouled membranes after lfl treatment are illustrated in fig 6 two characteristic peaks located around 1201 and 1146 cm 1 were observed in the ftir pattern at the feed ph 8 64 which originated from ch stretching vibrations he et al 2011 the corresponding functional groups were associated with high purity inorganic salts or small molecules in contrast the spectra of the samples became more complex with increasing feed ph the characteristic peaks near 1400 cm 1 pointed to ch angular transition vibrations carboxyl co vibrations and deprotonated carboxyl structures indicating the presence of carboxylic acids and phosphonates he et al 2011 this result verified the assumption that the hydrolysis of humic substances in lfl was enhanced by increasing feed ph peaks in the vicinity of 1203 and 1645 cm 1 were characteristic peaks of ch cn nh and nh2 vibrations in protein like substances besides multiple vibrational forms of co peaks could be observed within 1000 1230 cm 1 jiang et al 2004 ojeda et al 2008 the sharp peak at 870 cm 1 may represent glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides or ch stretching vibrations originating from the benzene ring xiao et al 2014 the peaks of oh stretching vibration at around 3353 cm 1 could be observed at increasing ph indicating an increase in the content of nom harboring carboxyl groups zarebska et al 2015 the ftir results showed that the membrane fouling mainly consisted of protein like polysaccharide like and humic like substances kataki et al 2017 zarebska et al 2015 the ftir bands showed no significant difference in positions for the membrane samples obtained at various feed phs but their intensities changed significantly implying differences in various organic components deposition on the membrane surface specifically the peak intensity of the hydroxyl groups was more pronounced with increasing ph indicating increasing hydrolysis of humic substances warsinger et al 2015 moreover the peak intensity of functional groups associating with organics co co cc and glycosidic bond increased significantly when the feed ph increased from 8 63 to 12 briefly increasing feed ph was more conducive to the complexation and co deposition of nom and inorganic ions on the membrane surface these results confirmed that the more severe fouling at high ph leads to a much faster flux decline in md 1 as observed in fig 4 fig 7 presents fluorescent eem spectra of cleaning wastes from the fouled membrane with pure water acid and alkali when the feed ph was 8 64 and 10 protein like substances and humic acids were the major components of cleaning wastes with pure water flushing the proportion of humic substances zone v increased significantly with increasing feed ph when the fouled membrane was cleaned by soaking in hcl solution the cleaning waste showed a much higher fluorescence intensity acid washing was more effective than alkaline washing at all ph conditions especially for aromatic protein substances zone i and dissolved microbial metabolites zone iv interestingly this phenomenon contradicted the conventional understanding that an alkaline environment was more favorable than an acidic environment for removing nom because organics were more readily hydrolyzed dissolved and saponified in an alkaline environment xiao et al 2012 in acidic cleaning the binds between organic foulants and inorganic scaling may be disintegrated along with the dissolution of inorganic scaling in acid yan et al 2022 overall it can be concluded that the higher feed ph promoted the binding of inorganic ions calcium and magnesium to nom resulting in escalating membrane fouling in itmd for lfl treatment 3 5 operating cost and energy recovery analysis costs and energy recovery in this study were calculated and compared with other ammonium removal and recovery processes fig 8 up to 2 5 g l of ammonium could be recovered using the ultrafiltration associated with md electrical energy system but the cost was as high as 9 11 m3 zico et al 2021 due to the high price of ultrafiltration membrane replacing electricity with solar energy does not significantly reduce the cost zico et al 2021 the air stripping was also expensive in recovering ammonia 3 76 m3 provolo et al 2017 in contrast the combination of ro and air stripping enabled simultaneous ammonia and clean water recoveries with a slight increase in cost compared to single stripping ledda et al 2013 vmd and further compressed the cost to 0 93 4 25 m3 of which 60 of the cost was attributed to chemical addition shi et al 2020 shi et al 2022 higher feed ammonium concentrations may increase costs due to reagent consumption the estimated treatment cost of the itmd process in treating lfl was only 2 3 m3 tables s4 and s5 which was only 22 71 of the total cost of stripping and other membrane processes although the initial investment operational costs for equipment and plant start up can be 50 60 of the total cost shi et al 2020 itmd still has a significant benefit in terms of profitability in treating lfl specifically itmd could recover high purity ammonium sulphate fig s5 from lfl with relatively low ammonium concentration for industrial and agricultural needs with economic and environmental benefits if the energy recovery is targeted the itmd process could provide a potential pathway to recover green ammonia and water from lfl concentrate and is highly competitive with existing technologies it is worth noting that the heat source significantly impacts the treatment cost and net profit of the temperature driven md process for wastewater treatment for example using waste heat to treat ad effluent approximately doubles the net profit than using natural gas shi et al 2022 accordingly itmd was able to utilize low grade heat and has the potential for further cost compression overall itmd is a more compact and simpler process for lfl treatment and ammonium recovery and offers considerable advantages in low energy consumption and high ammonium recovery 4 conclusions this study proposed an integrated two stage membrane distillation itmd to treat lfl effects of feed ph on the performances of itmd in water purification ammonia recovery and membrane fouling were comprehensively investigated the following conclusions can be drawn 1 pollutants in lfl could be efficiently rejected by itmd with removal rates of cod inorganic matters and metal ions consistently exceeding 99 95 99 87 and 99 97 respectively 2 increasing feed ph facilitated the improved ammonia recovery which was 1 3 1 5 and 1 7 times higher at ph 10 11 and 12 than that at ph 8 64 all the ammonium could be separated from the lfl at the feed ph of 12 and 75 of them could be effectively captured 3 as the feed ph increased from 8 64 to 12 the membrane flux decreased from 13 7 to 10 5 l m2 h the vapor flux was decreased by 23 at the feed ph of 12 compared to that at the ph of 8 64 increasing feed ph induced nom hydrolysis and complexation with calcium and magnesium forming a dense fouling layer however no membrane wetting occurred during the 30 h distillation 4 itmd simultaneously obtained high quality water and high purity recovered ammonia at a relatively low cost 2 3 m3 providing an economical and sustainable way to treat lfl in an environmentally friendly manner declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14723,resources recovery from landfill leachate lfl has been attracting growing attention instead of merely purifying the wastewater an integrated two stage membrane distillation itmd was proposed to simultaneously purify lfl and recover ammonia in this study the results showed that organics could be always effectively rejected by the itmd regardless of varying feed ph with cod removal higher than 99 with feed ph increased from 8 64 to 12 the ammonia migration 50 100 and capture 36 75 in lfl were considerably enhanced boosting the separated ammonia enrichment to 1 3 1 7 times due to the improved ammonium diffusion however the corresponding membrane flux of the first md stage decreased from 13 7 to 10 5 l m2 h elevating feed ph caused the deprotonation of nom and its binding with inorganic ions constituting a complex fouling layer on the membrane surface in the first md stage in contrast the membrane permeability and fouling of the second md were not affected by feed ph adjustment because only volatiles passed through the first md more importantly it was estimated that itmd could obtain high quality water and recover high purity ammonium from lfl with relatively low ammonium concentration at an input cost of 2 3 m3 which was very competitive with existing techniques these results demonstrated that the itmd can be a valuable candidate strategy for simultaneous water purification and nutrient recovery from landfill leachate graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords landfill leachate integrated two stage membrane distillation itmd ammonium recovery membrane fouling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sanitary landfill is still the most common municipal solid waste disposal approach owing to its ease of operation and cost effectiveness luo et al 2020 however the landfill process inevitably generates waste landfill leachate lfl which concentrates large amounts of hazardous pollutants including natural organic matter nom ammonium and heavy metals inappropriate treatment or disposal of lfl would always lead to grievous pollution to soil aquatic environment and even the ecological cycle yan et al 2022 hence it is of great challenge to purify the lfl to meet wastewater discharge or reuse requirements low biodegradability and high ammonium are prominent characteristics of lfl which makes conventional biological chemical or physicochemical treatments inadequate for lfl purification luo et al 2020 shao et al 2021 therefore various new and hybrid processes were proposed to fulfill this target pre oxidation associated with membrane separation has been widely reported for the deep purification of lfl aftab et al 2020 chen et al 2020 ye et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 the combinations of fenton ozonation with nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro membranes achieved satisfactory retention of humic substance 95 7 and salt 94 7 for lfl treatment ye et al 2019 large amounts of oxidants are required to efficiently degrade the high concentration nom in lfl chen et al 2020 besides the high pressure membrane processes i e nf and ro employed may undermine the economic feasibility aftab et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 moreover these processes could hardly recover valuable resources from the lfl incompatible with resource recycling and sustainable water industry ammonium in the lfl reaches 1000 3000 mg l which could be a valuable and recoverable resource lin et al 2013 the synthetic ammonia industry could be highly energy intensive and thus ammonium recovery would contribute to recycling economy and sustainable development he et al 2018 many technologies have been investigated for ammonium removal and recovery such as stripping nitrification denitrification and struvite precipitation zarebska et al 2014 but the ammonia recovery efficiencies or the costs of the above approaches were not satisfactory stripping could achieve only 71 ammonia removal when treating animal slurries ledda et al 2013 when treating wastewater the anammox process gained 69 3 ammonia removal lin et al 2016 struvite precipitation obtained 95 9 ammonia removal from municipal solid waste leachate treatment however large amounts of magnesium and phosphate were required escalating the application costs gu et al 2019 mavhungu et al 2021 accordingly a new technique is yet to be developed for effective ammonium recovery and water purification in wastewater treatment membrane distillation md a thermal driven process based on the principles of gas liquid equilibrium and heat mass transfer has attracted extensive attention recently drioli et al 2015 shirazi et al 2014 yan et al 2019a md can effectively retain non volatile pollutants with a hydrophobic microporous membrane as the separation medium only water vapor and gas can flow along the vapor pressure gradient direction into the distillate side more importantly there is a free conversion between ammonium and ammonia at temperatures and ph values adopted in the md application thus md is a prospective scheme for ammonium recovery qi et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 zico et al 2021 a previous study applied vacuum membrane distillation vmd to treat ro brine and an ideal and stable flux 3 l m2 h was obtained at a vacuum pressure of 0 08 mpa qi et al 2015 because md is a thermal driven membrane process the vapor flux of md is seldom affected by the salinity and the membrane exhibits higher resistance to membrane fouling than pressure driven membrane processes yan et al 2021b besides both nom and ammonium were reported to be effectively retained 98 during lfl treatment by forward osmosis fo combined with the md process zhou et al 2017 generally md has multiple advantages in operation pollutant separation and potential resource recovery zhou et al 2017 zico et al 2021 nevertheless the investigations on lfl treatment by md are performed mainly by setting md as the post processing for other membrane technologies applying solar powered one stage direct contact membrane distillation dcmd to lfl could remove ammonium by adjusting the feed ph to 5 however the ammonium removal rate was less than 59 yan et al 2021a zico et al 2021 hence the md is promising in ammonium recovery and water purification in lfl treatment but the process is yet to be ameliorated to allow better technical and economic feasibility accordingly an integrated two stage membrane distillation itmd with first stage md for ammonium extraction and second stage for ammonium concentration was proposed in this work and its performance for lfl treatment was investigated since the protonation and deprotonation of nom and ammonium in the lfl highly depend on the ph the effects of feed ph on pollutants rejection ammonium recovery and membrane fouling were evaluated the main objectives of this study are i to elucidate effects of feed ph on performance of ammonium recovery and nom removal ii to study characteristics and mechanisms of complex membrane fouling caused by co deposition of ammonium and nom iii to assess feasibility and economic benefits of the itmd for deep lfl treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of actual lfl real concentrated lfl was used as the feed water in the study the feed water was collected from the equalization tank at the landfill in shenzhen southern china the physicochemical properties of the lfl are presented in table 1 the average ammonium concentration of the lfl was 930 58 mg l implying a high potential of ammonium recovery the chemical oxygen demand cod and uv254 were 1291 83 mg l and 2 714 cm 1 respectively indicating a high risk of membrane fouling during lfl treatment using membrane technology 2 2 itmd system and membrane properties an itmd reactor was constructed in this study the itmd reactor consisted of two md membranes a temperature regulation system and an online monitoring system as illustrated in fig 1 two dcmd units were stacked in series namely the md 1 and md 2 three water channels were connected to the reactor namely the first intermediate and last channels the first channel enabled the separation and diffusion of ammonia the intermediate channel achieved the concentration and recovery of ammonium and the third channel obtained pure water specifically lfl was first pumped into the feed chamber of md 1 where sodium hydroxide was used to adjust the feed ph to enhance ammonia diffusion and increase ammonium concentration in the primary distillate md 1 distillate afterward the primary distillate was acidified by sulfuric acid to retain and concentrate the ammonium meanwhile only water vapor passed through the md 2 and thus high quality water could be obtained the electronic balances were used to measure the flux variation of the primary distillate continuously two microporous hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hydrophobic membranes x1020 suzhouminglie china with a surface area of 25 cm2 5 cm 5 cm were used in both md 1 and md 2 trade offs between distillate flux and pore wetting risk were made using hydrophobic membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 22 µm consistent with the pore size 0 16 0 5 µm commonly used in md processes alkhatib et al 2021 the water contact angle and thickness of the membrane were 120 and 200 μm respectively to keep the consistency of the repeated distillation tests the clean water distillation flux of the membranes was determined prior to the experiments and ptfe hydrophobic membranes with similar distillate fluxes were selected 2 3 experimental procedure to ensure consistency across all operating scenarios prefiltration of landfill leachate with a 0 45 μm membrane glass fiber haining china was adopted to remove suspended particles thereafter four feed ph levels of 8 64 10 11 and 12 were set up in md 1 and adjusted by 1 m l sodium hydroxide diluted sulfuric acid 2 78 mm l was introduced in the distillate side of md 1 for ammonium recovery in the first channel 2000 ml of leachate concentrate was circulated at 60 c at a flow rate of 300 ml min on the feed side of md 1 in the intermediate channel 1000 ml of diluted sulfuric acid solution was dispersed at 45 c at 400 ml min flow rate in the distillate side of md 1 which was also the feed side of md 2 in the last channel 1000 ml of ultrapure water was circulated at 20 c at a flow rate of 300 ml min on the distillate side of md 2 no additional prefiltration was used when the feed ph was changed in different scenarios in consideration of parallelity during the membrane distillation process the itmd system was initially run on a trial basis for 30 mins to stabilize the system data were not recorded the distillation process was then operated in triplicate for 30 consecutive hours 2 4 analytical methods removal of organics in lfl by the itmd system was assessed in terms of cod and uv254 cod was determined by a fast digestion spectrophotometric method using a cod digester drb200 hach usa and a spectrophotometer dr 2800 hach usa mei et al 2017 uv254 was determined by a uv visible spectrophotometer t6 pu analysis china ammonium was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry zitomer and lambert 1962 turbidity was measured by a turbidity meter hi98703 hanna italy conductivity and ph were determined by a conductivity meter ddsj 308f remagnetics china and a portable ph meter pb 10 sartorius german respectively ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm for solutions preparation and vessel washing was produced by a milli q purification system millipore bedford ma usa all samples were measured in triplicate and the reagents used were of analytical grade the membrane fouling and elemental composition were observed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometer analysis sem eds tescan mira lms tescan czech republic the fouled membrane samples were successively cleaned with pure water and chemicals submerged in 1 m l hydrochloric acid and 1 m l sodium hydroxide for 2 h then samples were characterized by the sem eds to evaluate the reversible and irreversible membrane fouling before observation samples were sprayed with a thin layer of platinum to increase the conductivity fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet is50 thermo usa was used to analyze the functional group compositions of the fouling layer purity of the recovered ammonium sulphate was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd 18 kw miniflex 600 rigaku japan the samples were scanned within 2θ of 10 70 using 1 54 å cu kα x rays at a rate of 0 02 deg s fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem was employed to determine the organic composition of the distillate using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf6000 shimadzu japan excitation and emission wavelengths of electroluminescence were set at 200 450 nm at an interval of 2 nm and 250 550 nm at an interval of 5 nm respectively the samples were diluted to uv254 0 05 cm 1 to eliminate the inner filter effect yu et al 2020a a pure water control group was set up to eliminate raman scattering by water yan et al 2021a 2 5 membrane flux and ammonium recovery efficiency calculation during the experiment the weight of the distillate was measured by an electronic balance bt224s sartorius german and the data were automatically recorded on a personal computer at an interval of 5 min the operating efficiency of the system was analyzed by calculating actual flux j and specific flux j j0 yan et al 2021a specifically j0 denotes the initial flux of ultrapure water filtered by the virgin membrane and j denotes the final flux after filtering the feed water the final flux j can be calculated as shown in eq 1 qu et al 2013 1 j v p a t where j is the distillate flux v p is the overflow volume of distillate t is the time interval a is the effective membrane area the ammonia recovery efficiency r n h 3 residue ammonia in the feed tank r e n h 3 ammonia loss l n h 3 and ammonia concentration ratio during the itmd process was calculated as shown in eqs 2 5 respectively xu and he 2021 2 r n h 3 c p n h 3 v p c f 0 n h 3 v f 0 100 where c p n h 3 and v p are the ammonia concentration in the permeate tank and the total permeate volume at the time when the sample was taken c f 0 n h 3 and v f 0 are the initial ammonia concentration and initial feed volume 3 r e

the itmd system the free ammonia can be stripped by transfer from liquid to gas thus the concentration ratio of the ammonia in the intermediate channel to ammonium in the feed solution is a major factor in evaluating the ammonia concentration efficiency of itmd defined as the ammonia concentration ratio c c n h 3 and estimated as follows 5 c cn h 3 c i n h 3 c f 0 n h 3 where c i n h 3 is the ammonia concentration in the intermediate channel the ammonia ammonium distribution in the solution was calculated as shown in eqs 6 9 quinn et al 1992 6 δ n h 3 o h k b o h k a k a h 7 δ nh 4 k b k b

performed based on the normalization of 1 m3 lfl operating costs included heat energy consumption pump circulation system and chemical addition revenues were the recovered ammonium sulphate and high

treatment by itmd in terms of ammonium concentration at various ph values is shown in fig 2 with increasing feed ph ammonium concentration on the feed side exhibited an overall decreasing trend fig 2a with no ph adjustment ph 8 64 the ammonium diffusion of md 1 feed side was relatively slow after a 30 h operation ammonium in the md 1 feed side was partially reduced from 932 to 780 mg l and the ammonium entered the intermediate channel was effectively concentrated with the ammonia concentration ratio of 1 2 fig 2b when the feed ph was adjusted to 10 11 and 12 ammonium concentrations in the md 1 feed side were reduced to 592 mg l 392 mg l and 5 mg l respectively correspondingly ammonium in the md 1 distillate reached 1236 mg l 1373 mg l and 1560 mg l corresponding to the ammonia concentration ratios of 1 3 1 5 and 1 7 respectively it is indicated that increasing feed ph significantly enhanced ammonia diffusion consistent with the result obtained in a previous study zico et al 2021 increasing feed ph would cause deprotonation of ammonium driving the conversion of ammonium to ammonia qu et al 2013 therefore ammonium in the lfl could be extracted efficiently besides the recovery efficiency was affected by distillation time and long term operation would highlight the discrepancy in the recovery efficiency fig 2c presents amounts of captured lost and residual ammoniums it can be observed that the ultimate percentage of separated ammonium in the lfl reached 50 after 30 h operation without ph adjustment however only 36 of the ammonium in the lfl was captured by md 1 corresponding to an ammonium loss of 14 in contrast elevating feed ph to 10 11 and 12 significantly reduced the residual ammonium in the feed lfl to 30 17 and 0 respectively in other words ammonium separation reached almost 100 at the feed ph of 12 and ammonium capture was raised to 75 this is consistence with the previous study which reported 84 2 ammonia recovery at ph 12 xu and he 2021 lost ammonia increased from 14 to 25 when the feed ph increased from 8 64 to 12 which might be owing to ammonia volatilization to the atmosphere besides no ammonium was detected in the md 2 distillate in addition ammonium was not detected in the md 2 distillate of the third channel at a feed water ph of 12 this result indicated that increasing the feed ph improved the ammonia recovery efficiency and the quality of distillate water in conclusion elevating feed ph to 12 had a more significant compensatory benefit in improving the separation and subsequent capture of ammonium in the lfl treatment by itmd the ammonia and ammonium balance in an aqueous solution is displayed in fig 2d the transformation of ammonium to ammonia in water is mainly influenced by acid base equilibrium of ammonium the interconversion of free and fixed ammonium henry s law from ammonium to ammonia transmembrane separation of ammonia and adsorption and immobilization of acid solution quinn et al 1992 according to the distribution fraction of conjugate acid base pairs of monobasic weak bases the calculated equilibrium between the atmospheric gas and particle phases was attained at a ph of 9 3 based on ammonia dissociate equilibration in an aqueous solution elevating the feed ph of md 1 facilitated more conversion of dissolved ammonium into gaseous ammonia subsequently ammonia could penetrate across md 1 along the water vapor gradient to achieve ammonium recovery moreover md was operated at a high temperature which could reduce ammonium dissolution in the water and benefit ammonia recovery zoungrana et al 2020 however in all cases the ammonium in the feed water decreased significantly within the first 6 h and the decreasing rate gradually slowed until the experiment was completed as the distillation process proceeded ammonium in the lfl gradually decreased according to fick s law the diffusion coefficient d at different feed ph conditions was not varying wildly si therefore it is likely that the decrease in the ammonium pressure gradient weakened the driving force of ammonium conversion to ammonia resulting in slowed ammonia migration in md 1 as the ph of the second channel was adjusted from 8 64 to 12 the concentration of ammonium in the third channel remained undetected indicating effective ammonium recovery and water purification 3 2 effects of feed ph on nom rejection in itmd system fig 3 presents nom rejections during lfl treatment using the itmd system it can be observed in fig 3a that the cod concentrations of the md 1 distillates were 27 1 25 8 22 6 and 15 1 mg l at feed ph 8 64 10 11 and 12 respectively corresponding cod removal rates eventually reached 97 9 98 1 98 2 and 98 8 fig 3b the result indicates that the md 1 was very efficient in nom rejection regardless of feed ph values however there was a small amount of volatile compounds in lfl resulting in occurrence of some organics in md 1 distillate a similar result was observed in a one stage dcmd system where 96 nom rejection was achieved in rubber processing effluent treatment mokhtar et al 2015 the cod concentration of md 2 distillate decreased with increasing feed ph at ph levels of 8 64 10 11 and 12 the cod concentrations of md 2 distillates were 6 02 4 52 3 15 and 0 52 mg l respectively the cod removal rates by itmd were over 99 5 in all scenarios higher than those of md 1 97 9 98 1 98 2 and 98 8 suggesting that md 2 could further retain the residual nom in the primary distillate the feed ph increase noticeably enhanced cod removal and absolute rejection of nom was achieved at the feed ph of 12 a possible reason is that the volatile organic compounds in the lfl were primarily volatile acids which would be retained in alkaline solution yan et al 2019b eem analysis of the distillates was performed to further assess the removal of organic components from the lfl by itmd as illustrated in fig 3c the fluorescence spectra are generally classified into five regions according to chemical composition zone i ex em 220 250 nm 280 330 nm and zone ii ex em 220 250 nm 330 380 nm represent aromatic protein substances zone iii ex em 220 250 nm 380 550 nm represents fulvic acid substances zone iv ex em 250 440 nm 280 380 nm represents soluble microbial products smps and zone v ex em 250 450 nm 380 550 nm represents humic substances respectively yu et al 2020b the results showed that small amounts of smp like substances were present in the md 1 distillate suggesting that adsorption desorption diffusion processes of organics may exist at the membrane gas surface interface smps could adsorb to the ptfe membrane surface through net particle surface interaction meanwhile carboxylic acids contained in volatile organic compounds would diffuse from the feed side to distillate side along the direction of vapor gradient through hydrogen bonding with water tijing et al 2015 the pollutants fluorescence intensity in both distillates decreased with the increasing feed ph supporting the assumption that ph affected the hydrolysis and functional group characteristics of nom another study on lfl treatment by md reported that elevating feed ph enhanced deprotonated organic inorganic complexation yan et al 2022 the fluorescence intensity of residual nom was significantly reduced in md 2 distillate demonstrating that the secondary membrane distillation effectively retained organic matter which coincided with the high cod rejection rate it has been reported that the second stage md further purified the effluent of the first stage md shi et al 2022 consistent with the results obtained in this study table s1 3 3 membrane flux and fouling in the itmd system the vapor fluxes of the itmd system at different ph values are displayed in fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4a the md 1 distillate flux decreased continuously at each ph condition as the feed ph increased from 8 64 to 10 11 and 12 the final distillate fluxes of md 1 decreased from around 11 l m2 h to 9 2 8 2 and 7 8 l m2 h respectively interestingly adjusting ph from 8 64 to 12 reduced the initial distillate flux by a quarter from 13 7 to 10 5 l m2 h the insoluble metal hydroxides e g ca oh 2 ca5 po4 3oh and mg oh 2 may be formed in the ph adjustment and they may further co precipitate with humic substance fig s1 similar results were reported in the study of membrane electrochemical reactor combined with membrane distillation mer md for lfl treatment where oh generated in the cathode chamber of mer reacted with ca2 and mg2 to form precipitates yan et al 2023 because there was a 30 min stabilization period for the itmd system co precipitates may be partially formed and reduced initial flux during the subsequent 2 3 h of membrane distillation co precipitates continued precipitating which may deposit on the membrane surface and deteriorate the distillate flux in addition md is a thermal driven process to achieve the separation of foulants from water fouling of the membrane surface caused by pressure gradients which occurs in conventional pressure driven membrane filtration processes does not occur in the md process el bourawi et al 2006 therefore the water purification efficiency and water production performance of the md process are much more stable in accordance with the consistency of distillate fluxes in triplicate md tests by contrast to membrane fouling special flux could reflect the impact of membrane fouling on permeate flux in real time in fig 4c the final specific flux decreased slightly to 0 85 for ph 8 64 and 10 groups the specific flux dropped more drastically in ph 11 and 12 groups this result indicated that an appropriate elevation in feed ph could retard flux decline however extremely high ph may severely compromise the vapor flux due to fouling the moderate alkalinity in the feed may allow mild aggregation of ha and inorganic metals the aggregates may form a relatively porous fouling layer on the membrane surface preventing the subsequent foulants from accessing the membrane pores it is reported that an excessive increase in ph might cause severe inorganic matter aggregation and hydrolysis of ha to generate carboxyl groups warsinger et al 2015 yan et al 2021a ions could bind with carboxyl groups reducing electrostatic repulsion between the organics and the membrane surface curcio et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 resulting in faster specific flux reduction to concentrate ammonium an appropriate amount of sulfuric acid was intermittently added to the md 1 distillate to transform ammonium into ammonium sulfate which cannot penetrate the md 2 hence the ph values of md 1 distillates were kept in the range of 5 58 6 32 table s1 for md 2 the feed ph did not significantly affect the actual vapor flux and specific flux owing to the satisfactory foulants rejection achieved by md 1 only water vapor and a small portion of the volatiles penetrated the md 2 resulting in a neutral condition of the md 2 distillate the ph values of md 2 distillates were in the range of 7 44 7 56 regardless of feed ph table s1 the slight flux reduction of md 2 might be due to the crystallization of concentrated ammonium salts on the membrane surface this result was consistent with the inorganic crystallization of calcium and magnesium during lfl treatment using dcmd yan et al 2021a 3 4 membrane autopsy and elemental composition of fouled membranes the morphological properties of the membrane surface and cross section are shown in the sem images fig 5 it can be observed that a large amount of foulants deposited on the surface of membranes in md 1 after a 30 hours operation fig 5 1 4a however the fouling coverage and morphology figs s2 and s3 of fouled membranes varied significantly as the feed ph changed at the feed ph 8 64 the foulants were dispersed and covered the membrane surface over a large area besides the aggregation of foulants on the membrane surface was strengthened as feed ph increased in particular the foulants tightly packed on the membrane surface after the feed ph increased to 11 the fouling layer showed a complete plate structure at feed ph 12 complexation and cross linking of inorganic ions with nom might cause dense co deposition on the membrane surface as supported by elemental mapping calcium carbon oxygen phosphorus and sulphur were widely distributed on the fouled membrane surface this result is consistent with the increased cod rejection and the decrease in distillation flux at elevated feed ph during lfl treatment by itmd furthermore fine crystalline particles of inorganic ions could be observed in the cross section of the membrane in md 1 fig 5 2 4b similarly in a study on the ammonia recovery from palladium leachate by dcmd inorganic crystals were found to cross link nom on the membrane surface resulting in severe membrane fouling and further inducing membrane wetting hu et al 2022 in md 2 the fouling layer was significantly reduced compared to md 1 fig s3 consistent with moderate flux reduction the efficient retention of nom and inorganic ions by md 1 was the underlying reason for the relatively less fouling of md 2 in fig 5c only a small amount of residual foulants was observed on the membrane surface after cleaning indicating that the fouling was reversible in all ph cases in conclusion the high ph exacerbated membrane fouling but the fouling in all cases was quite recoverable by cleaning the element compositions of the fouling layer and pristine membranes are shown in table s2 only carbon 38 40 and fluorine 61 60 were detected on the pristine ptfe membrane at the feed ph of 8 64 the fouling layer was dominated by carbon 26 82 and oxygen 35 12 the presence of oxygen indicated the deposition of nom on the membrane surface while a mild decrease in carbon content may be due to the organics covering the ptfe membrane similarly the low percentage of fluorine detected at feed ph 8 64 and 10 11 and 12 may be attributed to the shielding of the membrane surface by the fouling layer besides many inorganic elements including silicon calcium magnesium and phosphorus were observed in ftir spectra indicating the occurrence of inorganic scaling on the membrane surface the ratio of calcium composition increased from 15 30 to 39 76 along with the increase of feed ph from 8 64 to 12 this was consistent with previous studies which reported that increasing feed ph enhanced the complexation of calcium with nom on the membrane surface yan et al 2022 besides the complexation deposition was identified as the main causative factor for membrane fouling resulting in deteriorated distillate quality as reflected by increased conductivity the conductivity of md 2 distillates at four feed ph values showed no significant increase indicating that no membrane wetting occurred in md 2 fig s4 this could also be supported by the efficient rejection of organic and other constituents in the md 2 table s3 generally the itmd showed excellent lfl treatment performance and great long term operation potential the functional group characteristics of the fouled membranes after lfl treatment are illustrated in fig 6 two characteristic peaks located around 1201 and 1146 cm 1 were observed in the ftir pattern at the feed ph 8 64 which originated from ch stretching vibrations he et al 2011 the corresponding functional groups were associated with high purity inorganic salts or small molecules in contrast the spectra of the samples became more complex with increasing feed ph the characteristic peaks near 1400 cm 1 pointed to ch angular transition vibrations carboxyl co vibrations and deprotonated carboxyl structures indicating the presence of carboxylic acids and phosphonates he et al 2011 this result verified the assumption that the hydrolysis of humic substances in lfl was enhanced by increasing feed ph peaks in the vicinity of 1203 and 1645 cm 1 were characteristic peaks of ch cn nh and nh2 vibrations in protein like substances besides multiple vibrational forms of co peaks could be observed within 1000 1230 cm 1 jiang et al 2004 ojeda et al 2008 the sharp peak at 870 cm 1 may represent glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides or ch stretching vibrations originating from the benzene ring xiao et al 2014 the peaks of oh stretching vibration at around 3353 cm 1 could be observed at increasing ph indicating an increase in the content of nom harboring carboxyl groups zarebska et al 2015 the ftir results showed that the membrane fouling mainly consisted of protein like polysaccharide like and humic like substances kataki et al 2017 zarebska et al 2015 the ftir bands showed no significant difference in positions for the membrane samples obtained at various feed phs but their intensities changed significantly implying differences in various organic components deposition on the membrane surface specifically the peak intensity of the hydroxyl groups was more pronounced with increasing ph indicating increasing hydrolysis of humic substances warsinger et al 2015 moreover the peak intensity of functional groups associating with organics co co cc and glycosidic bond increased significantly when the feed ph increased from 8 63 to 12 briefly increasing feed ph was more conducive to the complexation and co deposition of nom and inorganic ions on the membrane surface these results confirmed that the more severe fouling at high ph leads to a much faster flux decline in md 1 as observed in fig 4 fig 7 presents fluorescent eem spectra of cleaning wastes from the fouled membrane with pure water acid and alkali when the feed ph was 8 64 and 10 protein like substances and humic acids were the major components of cleaning wastes with pure water flushing the proportion of humic substances zone v increased significantly with increasing feed ph when the fouled membrane was cleaned by soaking in hcl solution the cleaning waste showed a much higher fluorescence intensity acid washing was more effective than alkaline washing at all ph conditions especially for aromatic protein substances zone i and dissolved microbial metabolites zone iv interestingly this phenomenon contradicted the conventional understanding that an alkaline environment was more favorable than an acidic environment for removing nom because organics were more readily hydrolyzed dissolved and saponified in an alkaline environment xiao et al 2012 in acidic cleaning the binds between organic foulants and inorganic scaling may be disintegrated along with the dissolution of inorganic scaling in acid yan et al 2022 overall it can be concluded that the higher feed ph promoted the binding of inorganic ions calcium and magnesium to nom resulting in escalating membrane fouling in itmd for lfl treatment 3 5 operating cost and energy recovery analysis costs and energy recovery in this study were calculated and compared with other ammonium removal and recovery processes fig 8 up to 2 5 g l of ammonium could be recovered using the ultrafiltration associated with md electrical energy system but the cost was as high as 9 11 m3 zico et al 2021 due to the high price of ultrafiltration membrane replacing electricity with solar energy does not significantly reduce the cost zico et al 2021 the air stripping was also expensive in recovering ammonia 3 76 m3 provolo et al 2017 in contrast the combination of ro and air stripping enabled simultaneous ammonia and clean water recoveries with a slight increase in cost compared to single stripping ledda et al 2013 vmd and further compressed the cost to 0 93 4 25 m3 of which 60 of the cost was attributed to chemical addition shi et al 2020 shi et al 2022 higher feed ammonium concentrations may increase costs due to reagent consumption the estimated treatment cost of the itmd process in treating lfl was only 2 3 m3 tables s4 and s5 which was only 22 71 of the total cost of stripping and other membrane processes although the initial investment operational costs for equipment and plant start up can be 50 60 of the total cost shi et al 2020 itmd still has a significant benefit in terms of profitability in treating lfl specifically itmd could recover high purity ammonium sulphate fig s5 from lfl with relatively low ammonium concentration for industrial and agricultural needs with economic and environmental benefits if the energy recovery is targeted the itmd process could provide a potential pathway to recover green ammonia and water from lfl concentrate and is highly competitive with existing technologies it is worth noting that the heat source significantly impacts the treatment cost and net profit of the temperature driven md process for wastewater treatment for example using waste heat to treat ad effluent approximately doubles the net profit than using natural gas shi et al 2022 accordingly itmd was able to utilize low grade heat and has the potential for further cost compression overall itmd is a more compact and simpler process for lfl treatment and ammonium recovery and offers considerable advantages in low energy consumption and high ammonium recovery 4 conclusions this study proposed an integrated two stage membrane distillation itmd to treat lfl effects of feed ph on the performances of itmd in water purification ammonia recovery and membrane fouling were comprehensively investigated the following conclusions can be drawn 1 pollutants in lfl could be efficiently rejected by itmd with removal rates of cod inorganic matters and metal ions consistently exceeding 99 95 99 87 and 99 97 respectively 2 increasing feed ph facilitated the improved ammonia recovery which was 1 3 1 5 and 1 7 times higher at ph 10 11 and 12 than that at ph 8 64 all the ammonium could be separated from the lfl at the feed ph of 12 and 75 of them could be effectively captured 3 as the feed ph increased from 8 64 to 12 the membrane flux decreased from 13 7 to 10 5 l m2 h the vapor flux was decreased by 23 at the feed ph of 12 compared to that at the ph of 8 64 increasing feed ph induced nom hydrolysis and complexation with calcium and magnesium forming a dense fouling layer however no membrane wetting occurred during the 30 h distillation 4 itmd simultaneously obtained high quality water and high purity recovered ammonia at a relatively low cost 2 3 m3 providing an economical and sustainable way to treat lfl in an environmentally friendly manner declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14724,this study explored the effect of extracellular polymeric substance eps production on the performance of membrane based biofilm reactors changing eps production was induced by eliminating one of the main eps polysaccharides i e pel the studies were carried out using a pure culture of either pseudomonas aeruginosa or an isogenic p aeruginosa mutant that was unable to produce the pel polysaccharide the biofilm cell density for both strains was compared to confirm the pel deletion mutant decreased overall eps production in a bioreactor system when the pel deficient mutant was grown as a biofilm its cell density i e ratio of cells cells eps was 74 higher than the wild type showing eps production was reduced by eliminating pel production the growth kinetics were determined for both strains the pel deficient mutant had a maximum specific growth rate μ that was 14 higher than the wild type next the effects of eps reduction on reactor performance were assessed for a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr and a membrane bioreactor mbr for the mabr the organic removal with the pel deficient mutant was around 8 higher than for the wild type for the mbr the time to reach the fouling threshold was 65 greater for the pel deficient mutant than for the wild type these results suggest that amount of eps production can have significant effects on bacterial growth kinetics and bacterial cell density which in turn can affect the performance of the membrane based biofilm reactors in both cases lower eps production correlated with more efficient treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pel eps biofilms mabr mbr genetically engineered organisms geo data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bacterial extracellular polymeric substances eps are high molecular weight polymers consisting primarily of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acid and lipids eps serves a range of functions in biofilms such as adhesion to surfaces aggregation of bacterial cells cohesion of biofilms structure stability retention of water protection against antimicrobials and sorption of nutrients flemming 2011 flemming et al 2016 despite the benefits to bacteria eps production can cause operating problems for biofilm reactors for example biofilm eps causes fouling in membrane bioreactors mbr al malack 2007 buzatu et al 2018 this is true even when the biofilms on mbr membranes are used to degrade dissolved contaminants li and chu 2003 mutamim et al 2012 mutamim et al 2013 maintaining thin biofilms by reducing eps production may allow treatment with less biofilm fouling in membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabr o2 is supplied to the biofilm from the base attachment surface while contaminants are supplied the bulk liquid this counter diffusion of substrates make the mabr vulnerable to mass transfer limitation decreasing the substrate consumptions rate syron and casey 2008 maintaining a thin dense biofilm could also lead to better performance perez calleja et al 2022 note that despite the similar names and the use of biofilms mbrs and mabrs are different types of reactors and are normally used for different applications a graphic comparing the two types of reactors is shown in the supplementary material fig s1 controlling eps production may not only reduce excess biofilm accumulation but also increase the bacterial density in biofilms the mass transfer resistance of a biofilm is governed by the biofilm cell density which in turn are affected by the rates of eps formation rittmann and mccarty 2001 siegrist and gujer 1985 stewart 2003 since cell density in biofilms i e the number of cells in the unit biofilm volume is one of parameters governing contaminant removal rates rittmann and mccarty 2001 the effects of eps ratio on cell density can affect system performance in biofilm reactors for example denser biofilms can increase the rates of chemical consumption by reducing mass transfer resistance this study addressed the effects of eps production rates on system performance in two representative types of membrane based biofilm treatment technologies mbrs and mabrs performance was assessed based on contaminant removal fluxes biofilm accumulation biofilm mechanical stability and membrane fouling for mbr only pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 was used as a model biofilm bacterium davies et al 1998 diggle and whiteley 2021 ghafoor et al 2011 p aeruginosa can produce biofilms with three specific polysaccharides alginate pel and psl colvin et al 2012 in this study high cell density p aeruginosa biofilms were produced by eliminating one type of p aeruginosa polysaccharide pel this was achieved by using a p aeruginosa isogenic mutant strain constructed to lack a gene required for pel synthesis resulting in lower rates of eps production batch tests were conducted to study effects of eps production on bacterial growth kinetics the kinetic parameters were used to understand their behavior in those biofilm systems 2 materials and methods the tests carried out in this research are summarized in table 1 each test compared the two p aeruginosa pao1 strains the

averaging the values within the linear viscoelastic region results from the 12 data points were averaged to obtain the average g and g values for reactors for each experiment 2 8 kinetic parameter measurement three types of maximum specific growth rates μ were determined based on vss μ v s s based on absorbance at 600 nm μ a b s and based on gfp fluorescence for μ f l o the od600 measurement is based on light scattering not absorbance donmez et al 2020 meaning od600 was affected by both eps and cells goh et al 2005 xie et al 2015 the fluorescence signal 480 nm as excitation and 511nm as emission specifically targeted green fluorescent protein in the wt and mt cells not the eps thus the fluorescence signal only quantified cells bloemberg et al 1997 2 8 1 kinetics based on vss batch tests based on monod kinetics were conducted to obtain μ v s s and yvss of the wt and mt strains experiments for each of the wt and mt reactors were conducted in triplicate for determining the yvss

the bulk making the initial vss and scod around 12 mg l and 600 mg l cod respectively samples were taken periodically and the vss and scod of the samples were measured next the time series data were converted into the substrate utilization rate and the specific growth rates using curve fitting following pala and bolukbas 2005 for determining the μ v s s a series of batch tests were conducted under several different scod vss ratios as follows 200 4 300 4 400 4 500 4 600 4 and 1000 4 the batch mode was maintained 24 hr with continuous air supply final samples were taken at 24 hr and scod and vss were measured parameters were obtained per pala and bolukbas 2005 2 8 2 kinetics based on absorbance and fluorescence batch tests were conducted with microplates microplates for fluorescence based assays 96 wells m33089 thermofisher scientific usa and a microplate reader synergy h1 biotek instruments vermont usa to determine the μ a b s and μ f l o the tests used 100 µl acetate medium mixture 600 mg l cod each well plus 5 µl of inoculum for each wt and mt 8 wells were prepared as replicates an additional 8 wells were prepared without inoculum as a blank the experiment was run for 14 h the microplate reader measured and recorded od600 and fluorescence hourly the μ values were determined by linear regression based on the log of growth vs time also the ratio of cells cells eps was determined by the ratio of the μ f l o and the μ a b s providing an indirect estimate of cell density 3 results 3 1 kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for the wt and mt strains triplicate batch tests were performed based on vss which includes cells and eps together the result showed that mt had lower μ v s s and yvss values than the wt fig 3 yvss values were 0 67 0 11 and 0 25 0 13 gvss gcod for wt and mt respectively μ v s s values were 0 52 0 03 and 0 25 0 39 h 1 for wt and mt respectively eight replicates batch tests were run with the microplate reader based on absorbance cells and eps and fluorescence cells to determine the μ a b s and μ f l o respectively fig 4 the average μ a b s of the wt was 0 60 0 07 h 1 which was higher than that of the mt 0 41 0 05 h 1 the μ f l o for the mt 0 54 0 05 h 1 was higher than for the wt 0 46 0 06 h 1 the μ f l o μ a b s ratio reflecting cells cells eps for wt and mt were 0 76 0 15 and 1 32 0 22 respectively 3 2 mabr performance the mabr performance was assessed by effluent quality biofilm accumulation biofilm roughness and biofilm mechanical stability at the steady state the results shown below figs 5 7 are the averages of three replicate experiments biofilm thicknesses for the wt and mt reactors were 246 27 and 119 24 µm respectively the biofilm relative roughness for wt and mt were 5 6 2 4 and 10 2 2 6 unitless respectively the effluent quality for the wt reactor was 140 15 mg l of scod and 27 6 mg l of vss while for the mt reactor showed 104 10 mg l scod and 18 4 mg l vss fig 6 a scod and vss over the course of the experiment were shown in fig 6 b and 6 c respectively lastly the storage g and loss moduli g of the wt biofilms were 29 400 11 000 and 2 200 900 pa respectively for the mt biofilms the storage and loss moduli were 12 700 2 000 pa and 900 70 pa respectively 3 3 mbr performance of wt and mt mbr performance was assessed by effluent quality biofilm accumulation biofilm roughness running time and biofilm mechanical stability when fouled i e when the tmp reached 3 bars the results shown below are the average value of three replicate experiments figs 8 10 the average effluent scod values when fouling happened for the wt and mt biofilms were 470 54 and 454 44 mgo2 l respectively scod over the course of the experiment was shown in fig 9 right the biofilm thickness for the wt and mt reactors were 90 15 and 85 10 µm respectively the biofilm relative roughness for the wt and mt reactors were 3 0 0 5 and 3 2 0 6 unitless respectively the running times with wt and mt biofilms were 26 3 and 43 3 days respectively fig 9 left lastly the storage and loss moduli of wt biofilms were 6 100 600 and 1 100 100 pa respectively storage and loss moduli of mt biofilms were 1 200 200 and 300 30 pa respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effect of eps production on bacterial kinetic parameters and biofilm density the wt had a higher μ v s s and yvss than the mt with statistically significant differences t test p 0 01 for y and p 0 03 for μ since the kinetic parameters via vss includes cells and eps elimination of pel polysaccharide appeared to decrease the y and μ values in biofilms eps typically accounts for 50 90 of the total organic carbon donlan 2002 flemming et al 2000 jahn and nielsen 1998 where polysaccharide is one of the main eps components flemming 2011 flemming et al 2007 elimination of pel synthesis reduced the mass of biofilms at each sampling point resulting in smaller y and μ values for the mt similarly the wt had higher μ values than the mt based on absorbance statistically significant t test p 0 01 considering that eps affects the absorbance value mojica et al 2007 zhang and yi 2022 altering eps by eliminating pel appears to decrease the μ for the mt the μ f l o in contrast was higher for mt than for wt t test p 10 4 with the fluorescence targeted cells only eps suppression increases the bacterial growth rate a possible explanation is that the energy and carbon saving from elimination of pel synthesis increase the cell replication rate increasing the μ f l o value for mt considering that eps production by microorganisms induces a significant investment of carbon and energy wolfaardt et al 1999 elimination of pel synthesis could explain the cell s higher growth rate the hypothesis is supported by previous research where eps suppressed strains showed faster growth rates than eps producing strains jayathilake et al 2017 the difference in μ f l o between the wt and mt was smaller than the difference for μ a b s fig 4 this means that the main factor changing the indirect cell density was not the change in cell growth rate based on fluorescence but by eps reduction by pel deletion the differences in μ values for wt and mt based on the absorbance and fluorescence based measurements suggests that the bacterial cell densities were affected by eps the wt had a higher μ a b s value and lower μ f l o which suggests that wt biofilms have the smaller number of cells in a unit biofilm volume than mt biofilms therefore the mt biofilm density would be higher this is supported by the fact that the ratio of fluorescence to absorbance at each sampling point during the batch tests were always around two times higher for mt than for the wt data not shown 4 2 effect of decreased eps production on mabr performance the biofilm thickness for mt 119 µm was lower than that for the wt 246 µm t test p 10 8 since the biofilm thickness includes both eps and cells elimination of pel polysaccharide appears to decrease the biofilm thickness for mt also the decreased eps production appeared to result in decreased effluent solids the effluent solids i e vss were decreased from 27 mg l for wt to 18 mg l for mt t test p 10 7 the effluent solids result from the combined effect of detached biofilm and suspended bacterial growth the lower y value of mt relative to wt lowered the amount of suspended solids and biofilm accumulation explaining the decreased effluent solids in spite of the lower biofilm accumulation mt biofilms showed lower effluent scod than wt the effluent scod was 140 mgo2 l for wt and 104 mgo2 l for mt t test p 10 8 the opposite result between the biomass accumulation and effluent scod between mt and wt might be caused by their differences in cell density the high cell density biofilms of mt would likely increase the substrate removal causing the lower effluent scod the benefits of eliminating pel polysaccharides may be weakened by the poorer mechanical stability of mt biofilms for the biofilm system maintaining biofilm coverage and optimum biofilm thickness is important for stable performance elenter et al 2007 lackner et al 2009 morgenroth and wilderer 2000 biofilms mechanical properties govern the response against the external forces such as shear stress stoodley et al 2002a stoodley et al 2002b and the impaired properties can increase biofilm sloughing kim and nerenberg 2021 kim et al 2020 in this study eliminating pel polysaccharides reduced the biofilms mechanical stability where both storage and loss moduli for mt were lower than those for wt t test p 10 4 for storage modulus and p 10 3 for loss modulus in addition eliminating pel polysaccharide resulted in increased biofilm roughness which could negatively affect biofilm stability the relative roughness of biofilms was 10 2 for mt compared to 5 6 for the wt t test p 10 4 the higher biofilm roughness makes the greater shear stress which can increase the biofilm sloughing shen et al 2015 therefore it is plausible that mt biofilms are more vulnerable to biofilm sloughing than wt biofilms 4 3 effects of eps production on mbr performance for the mbr the average biofilm thickness of wt was higher than 90 µm while that of the mt was 85 µm however the difference was not statistically significant t test p 0 45 this may be because the experiment was stopped when the membrane reached the fouling threshold 3 bar in this study and the fouling pressure may have been reached for a certain biofilm thickness since the biofilms fully covered the membranes for both conditions data not shown the biofilm thickness was the main factor affecting the fouling pressure it also shows that the membrane fouling mostly depend on the physical biofilm thickness similarly the biofilm relative roughness of the wt reactor was 3 2 vs 3 0 for the mt but the difference was not statistically significant t test p 0 34 previous research showed that biofilm growth under pressure decreases surface roughness derlon et al 2014 desmond et al 2018 dreszer et al 2014 jafari et al 2019 therefore the biofilm growth under the positive hydraulic pressure might explain the similar biofilm roughness of wt and mt for mbr system this is consistent with the finding that relative roughness values of wt and mt for the mbr were much smaller than those for the mabr which was exposed to the negligible hydraulic pressure similarly there was an insignificant difference of effluent scod between wt and mt although the high cell density mt biofilms showed better effluent scod 454 mg l than the low cell density wt biofilms 470 mg l the difference was not statistically significant t test p 0 34 a possible explanation is the oxygen limitation of the mbr system the oxygen concentration in the air sparged media was around 8 26 mgo2 l at 25 c which was not enough for the influent cod concentration 600 mg l the mbr with mt and wt biofilms consumed 146 and 130 cod respectively this means that the most oxygen used for the cod consumption was not from the oxygen in influent media it is plausible that oxygen consumed in biofilms diffused from the atmosphere through the membrane to the biofilms through the plastic mesh and membrane since the oxygen transport through the mesh was passive and slow the mbr biofilms were exposed by the oxygen limiting condition throughout the study therefore the wt and mt mbrs had negligible differences in effluent scod the high cell density mt biofilms made a significant difference in the running time of mbr reactor t test p 0 01 the running time of the wt reactor was around 70 higher than that of the mt reactor since mt biofilms produce less eps it would take longer to reach the fouling thickness resulting in the increased running time the membrane fouling and the decreased running time are the main limitation of the mbr system meng et al 2017 the extended running time of the mt reactor which had substrate removals similar to the wt reactor can reduce operating costs also mt biofilms in mbr showed lower mechanical stability than the wt biofilms t test p 10 4 for storage modulus and p 10 4 for loss modulus the impaired mechanical properties could be beneficial at mbr system by making backwashing more efficient in membrane cleaning processes weakened biofilms are more vulnerable to detachment in our research we reduced eps production in the mutant biofilm by reducing the formation of a specific polysaccharide pel it is possible that the difference in eps composition could have affected reactor performance however eps composition is highly variable in practice and there is little evidence that it has an important effect on the performance of mabrs or mbrs for contaminant removal in contrast it is well known that biofilm density can have an important effect on reactor performance thus we believe that the lower level of eps formation in the mutant leading to higher density biofilms the pel deletion may have affected traits beyond the reduced production of eps but none were observed and as mentioned above we believe it is reasonable to attribute the difference in performance to differences in the overall amount of eps formation 4 4 application of genetically engineered organisms geo in biological wastewater treatment in many disciplines geos are used to improve biological processes such as a biofuel production radakovits et al 2010 heavy metal removal deng et al 2003 deng et al 2007 duprey et al 2014 toxic chemical monitoring bhuvaneshwari et al 2019 schirmer et al 2018 and biorefinery perez et al 2019 perez et al 2022 despite the promising advantages the application of geos in biological wastewater treatment is limited one important hurdle is the potential impact of geos on natural ecosystems the release of geos into ecosystems may result in genetic pollution which means the uncontrolled gene flow from geos into natural populations ellstrand 2001 godheja 2013 this can be detrimental to natural organisms and lead to the evolution of harmful species auer 2008 hur et al 2011 phillips 2008 snow and palma 1997 these risks can be avoided by using closed systems the mbr could be a good candidate as the membrane can completely block the release of geos however the breakage of membranes and backwashing water present risks an additional disinfection system such as uv or chlorine can help mitigate this risk in addition research assessing the effects of the newly designed geo on natural ecosystems should precede their use another hurdle is ensuring that geos within the treatment process are not outcompeted by natural microbial communities or that geos lose their modified genes fujita et al 1991 therefore a selective pressure strategy for geos is desirable a traditional strategy is to insert an antibiotic resistance gene to the geo park et al 2003 for example a membrane coated with antibiotic metals such as silver mercury or copper can be used to provide selective pressure for geos with metal resistance genes however the addition of antibiotic genes could spread antibiotic resistance karkman et al 2018 another potential strategy is to exploit the fact that low eps producing organisms may have higher yields and growth rates than conventional bacteria as show in this study choosing the design parameters giving a selective pressure to the geo could help maintain its dominance in bioreactors 5 conclusions the major findings of this research are eliminating pel polysaccharide resulted in higher growth kinetics of p aeruginosa in controlled reactor systems eliminating pel polysaccharide increased the bacterial cell density in developed biofilms the biofilms without pel production were mechanically weaker which was disadvantageous for mabrs but advantageous for mbrs for the mabr eliminating pel polysaccharide production reduced the effluent solids and organics concentrations but the biofilms were mechanically weaker for the mbr eliminating pel polysaccharide production extended the reactor running time the observed mechanically weaker biofilms may allow for more efficient backwashing these results show that p aeruginosa biofilms without pel polysaccharide may improve the performance of mabrs and mbrs for practical application of the findings it is essential to address the effects of the geo culture on the natural environment also future research should address strategies to maintain the dominance of low eps cultures in the reactors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14724,this study explored the effect of extracellular polymeric substance eps production on the performance of membrane based biofilm reactors changing eps production was induced by eliminating one of the main eps polysaccharides i e pel the studies were carried out using a pure culture of either pseudomonas aeruginosa or an isogenic p aeruginosa mutant that was unable to produce the pel polysaccharide the biofilm cell density for both strains was compared to confirm the pel deletion mutant decreased overall eps production in a bioreactor system when the pel deficient mutant was grown as a biofilm its cell density i e ratio of cells cells eps was 74 higher than the wild type showing eps production was reduced by eliminating pel production the growth kinetics were determined for both strains the pel deficient mutant had a maximum specific growth rate μ that was 14 higher than the wild type next the effects of eps reduction on reactor performance were assessed for a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr and a membrane bioreactor mbr for the mabr the organic removal with the pel deficient mutant was around 8 higher than for the wild type for the mbr the time to reach the fouling threshold was 65 greater for the pel deficient mutant than for the wild type these results suggest that amount of eps production can have significant effects on bacterial growth kinetics and bacterial cell density which in turn can affect the performance of the membrane based biofilm reactors in both cases lower eps production correlated with more efficient treatment processes graphical

extracellular polymeric substances eps are high molecular weight polymers consisting primarily of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acid and lipids eps serves a range of functions in biofilms such as adhesion to surfaces aggregation of bacterial cells cohesion of biofilms structure stability retention of water protection against antimicrobials and sorption of nutrients flemming 2011 flemming et al 2016 despite the benefits to bacteria eps production can cause operating problems for biofilm reactors for example biofilm eps causes fouling in membrane bioreactors mbr al malack 2007 buzatu et al 2018 this is true even when the biofilms on mbr membranes are used to degrade dissolved contaminants li and chu 2003 mutamim et al 2012 mutamim et al 2013 maintaining thin biofilms by reducing eps production may allow treatment with less biofilm fouling in membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabr o2 is supplied to the biofilm from the base attachment surface while contaminants are supplied the bulk liquid this counter diffusion of substrates make the mabr vulnerable to mass transfer limitation decreasing the substrate consumptions rate syron and casey 2008 maintaining a thin dense biofilm could also lead to better performance perez calleja et al 2022 note that despite the similar names and the use of biofilms mbrs and mabrs are different types of reactors and are normally used for different applications a graphic comparing the two types of reactors is shown in the supplementary material fig s1 controlling eps production may not only reduce excess biofilm accumulation but also increase the bacterial density in biofilms the mass transfer resistance of a biofilm is governed by the biofilm cell density which in turn are affected by the rates of eps formation rittmann and mccarty 2001 siegrist and gujer 1985 stewart 2003 since cell density in biofilms i e the number of cells in the unit biofilm volume is one of parameters governing contaminant removal rates rittmann and mccarty 2001 the effects of eps ratio on cell density can affect system performance in biofilm reactors for example denser biofilms can increase the rates of chemical consumption by reducing mass transfer resistance this study addressed the effects of eps production rates on system performance in two representative types of membrane based biofilm treatment technologies mbrs and mabrs performance was assessed based on contaminant removal fluxes biofilm accumulation biofilm mechanical stability and membrane fouling for mbr only pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 was used as a model biofilm bacterium davies et al 1998 diggle and whiteley 2021 ghafoor et al 2011 p aeruginosa can produce biofilms with three specific polysaccharides alginate pel and psl colvin et al 2012 in this study high cell density p aeruginosa biofilms were produced by eliminating one type of p aeruginosa polysaccharide pel this was achieved by using a p aeruginosa isogenic mutant strain constructed to lack a gene required for pel synthesis resulting in lower rates of eps production batch tests were conducted to study effects of eps production on bacterial growth kinetics the kinetic parameters were used to understand their behavior in those biofilm systems 2 materials and methods the tests carried out in this research are summarized in table 1 each test compared the two p aeruginosa pao1 strains the

4 08 µm horizontal and 2 03 µm vertical the 9 images were used to assess average biofilm thickness and roughness in this study the average biofilm thickness was used to indicate the average amount of biomass a matlab routine lewandowski and beyenal 2013 was used to calculate the average biofilm thickness and roughness from 9 images for both the mabr and mbr studies the steps for image analysis as

averaging the values within the linear viscoelastic region results from the 12 data points were averaged to obtain the average g and g values for reactors for each experiment 2 8 kinetic parameter measurement three types of maximum specific growth rates μ were determined based on vss μ v s s based on absorbance at 600 nm μ a b s and based on gfp fluorescence for μ f l o the od600 measurement is based on light scattering not absorbance donmez et al 2020 meaning od600 was affected by both eps and cells goh et al 2005 xie et al 2015 the fluorescence signal 480 nm as excitation and 511nm as emission specifically targeted green fluorescent protein in the wt and mt cells not the eps thus the fluorescence signal only quantified cells bloemberg et al 1997 2 8 1 kinetics based on vss batch tests based on monod kinetics were conducted to obtain μ v s s and yvss of the wt and mt strains experiments for each of the wt and mt reactors were conducted in triplicate for determining the yvss

the bulk making the initial vss and scod around 12 mg l and 600 mg l cod respectively samples were taken periodically and the vss and scod of the samples were measured next the time series data were converted into the substrate utilization rate and the specific growth rates using curve fitting following pala and bolukbas 2005 for determining the μ v s s a series of batch tests were conducted under several different scod vss ratios as follows 200 4 300 4 400 4 500 4 600 4 and 1000 4 the batch mode was maintained 24 hr with continuous air supply final samples were taken at 24 hr and scod and vss were measured parameters were obtained per pala and bolukbas 2005 2 8 2 kinetics based on absorbance and fluorescence batch tests were conducted with microplates microplates for fluorescence based assays 96 wells m33089 thermofisher scientific usa and a microplate reader synergy h1 biotek instruments vermont usa to determine the μ a b s and μ f l o the tests used 100 µl acetate medium mixture 600 mg l cod each well plus 5 µl of inoculum for each wt and mt 8 wells were prepared as replicates an additional 8 wells were prepared without inoculum as a blank the experiment was run for 14 h the microplate reader measured and recorded od600 and fluorescence hourly the μ values were determined by linear regression based on the log of growth vs time also the ratio of cells cells eps was determined by the ratio of the μ f l o and the μ a b s providing an indirect estimate of cell density 3 results 3 1 kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for the wt and mt strains triplicate batch tests were performed based on vss which includes cells and eps together the result showed that mt had lower μ v s s and yvss values than the wt fig 3 yvss values were 0 67 0 11 and 0 25 0 13 gvss gcod for wt and mt respectively μ v s s values were 0 52 0 03 and 0 25 0 39 h 1 for wt and mt respectively eight replicates batch tests were run with the microplate reader based on absorbance cells and eps and fluorescence cells to determine the μ a b s and μ f l o respectively fig 4 the average μ a b s of the wt was 0 60 0 07 h 1 which was higher than that of the mt 0 41 0 05 h 1 the μ f l o for the mt 0 54 0 05 h 1 was higher than for the wt 0 46 0 06 h 1 the μ f l o μ a b s ratio reflecting cells cells eps for wt and mt were 0 76 0 15 and 1 32 0 22 respectively 3 2 mabr performance the mabr performance was assessed by effluent quality biofilm accumulation biofilm roughness and biofilm mechanical stability at the steady state the results shown below figs 5 7 are the averages of three replicate experiments biofilm thicknesses for the wt and mt reactors were 246 27 and 119 24 µm respectively the biofilm relative roughness for wt and mt were 5 6 2 4 and 10 2 2 6 unitless respectively the effluent quality for the wt reactor was 140 15 mg l of scod and 27 6 mg l of vss while for the mt reactor showed 104 10 mg l scod and 18 4 mg l vss fig 6 a scod and vss over the course of the experiment were shown in fig 6 b and 6 c respectively lastly the storage g and loss moduli g of the wt biofilms were 29 400 11 000 and 2 200 900 pa respectively for the mt biofilms the storage and loss moduli were 12 700 2 000 pa and 900 70 pa respectively 3 3 mbr performance of wt and mt mbr performance was assessed by effluent quality biofilm accumulation biofilm roughness running time and biofilm mechanical stability when fouled i e when the tmp reached 3 bars the results shown below are the average value of three replicate experiments figs 8 10 the average effluent scod values when fouling happened for the wt and mt biofilms were 470 54 and 454 44 mgo2 l respectively scod over the course of the experiment was shown in fig 9 right the biofilm thickness for the wt and mt reactors were 90 15 and 85 10 µm respectively the biofilm relative roughness for the wt and mt reactors were 3 0 0 5 and 3 2 0 6 unitless respectively the running times with wt and mt biofilms were 26 3 and 43 3 days respectively fig 9 left lastly the storage and loss moduli of wt biofilms were 6 100 600 and 1 100 100 pa respectively storage and loss moduli of mt biofilms were 1 200 200 and 300 30 pa respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effect of eps production on bacterial kinetic parameters and biofilm density the wt had a higher μ v s s and yvss than the mt with statistically significant differences t test p 0 01 for y and p 0 03 for μ since the kinetic parameters via vss includes cells and eps elimination of pel polysaccharide appeared to decrease the y and μ values in biofilms eps typically accounts for 50 90 of the total organic carbon donlan 2002 flemming et al 2000 jahn and nielsen 1998 where polysaccharide is one of the main eps components flemming 2011 flemming et al 2007 elimination of pel synthesis reduced the mass of biofilms at each sampling point resulting in smaller y and μ values for the mt similarly the wt had higher μ values than the mt based on absorbance statistically significant t test p 0 01 considering that eps affects the absorbance value mojica et al 2007 zhang and yi 2022 altering eps by eliminating pel appears to decrease the μ for the mt the μ f l o in contrast was higher for mt than for wt t test p 10 4 with the fluorescence targeted cells only eps suppression increases the bacterial growth rate a possible explanation is that the energy and carbon saving from elimination of pel synthesis increase the cell replication rate increasing the μ f l o value for mt considering that eps production by microorganisms induces a significant investment of carbon and energy wolfaardt et al 1999 elimination of pel synthesis could explain the cell s higher growth rate the hypothesis is supported by previous research where eps suppressed strains showed faster growth rates than eps producing strains jayathilake et al 2017 the difference in μ f l o between the wt and mt was smaller than the difference for μ a b s fig 4 this means that the main factor changing the indirect cell density was not the change in cell growth rate based on fluorescence but by eps reduction by pel deletion the differences in μ values for wt and mt based on the absorbance and fluorescence based measurements suggests that the bacterial cell densities were affected by eps the wt had a higher μ a b s value and lower μ f l o which suggests that wt biofilms have the smaller number of cells in a unit biofilm volume than mt biofilms therefore the mt biofilm density would be higher this is supported by the fact that the ratio of fluorescence to absorbance at each sampling point during the batch tests were always around two times higher for mt than for the wt data not shown 4 2 effect of decreased eps production on mabr performance the biofilm thickness for mt 119 µm was lower than that for the wt 246 µm t test p 10 8 since the biofilm thickness includes both eps and cells elimination of pel polysaccharide appears to decrease the biofilm thickness for mt also the decreased eps production appeared to result in decreased effluent solids the effluent solids i e vss were decreased from 27 mg l for wt to 18 mg l for mt t test p 10 7 the effluent solids result from the combined effect of detached biofilm and suspended bacterial growth the lower y value of mt relative to wt lowered the amount of suspended solids and biofilm accumulation explaining the decreased effluent solids in spite of the lower biofilm accumulation mt biofilms showed lower effluent scod than wt the effluent scod was 140 mgo2 l for wt and 104 mgo2 l for mt t test p 10 8 the opposite result between the biomass accumulation and effluent scod between mt and wt might be caused by their differences in cell density the high cell density biofilms of mt would likely increase the substrate removal causing the lower effluent scod the benefits of eliminating pel polysaccharides may be weakened by the poorer mechanical stability of mt biofilms for the biofilm system maintaining biofilm coverage and optimum biofilm thickness is important for stable performance elenter et al 2007 lackner et al 2009 morgenroth and wilderer 2000 biofilms mechanical properties govern the response against the external forces such as shear stress stoodley et al 2002a stoodley et al 2002b and the impaired properties can increase biofilm sloughing kim and nerenberg 2021 kim et al 2020 in this study eliminating pel polysaccharides reduced the biofilms mechanical stability where both storage and loss moduli for mt were lower than those for wt t test p 10 4 for storage modulus and p 10 3 for loss modulus in addition eliminating pel polysaccharide resulted in increased biofilm roughness which could negatively affect biofilm stability the relative roughness of biofilms was 10 2 for mt compared to 5 6 for the wt t test p 10 4 the higher biofilm roughness makes the greater shear stress which can increase the biofilm sloughing shen et al 2015 therefore it is plausible that mt biofilms are more vulnerable to biofilm sloughing than wt biofilms 4 3 effects of eps production on mbr performance for the mbr the average biofilm thickness of wt was higher than 90 µm while that of the mt was 85 µm however the difference was not statistically significant t test p 0 45 this may be because the experiment was stopped when the membrane reached the fouling threshold 3 bar in this study and the fouling pressure may have been reached for a certain biofilm thickness since the biofilms fully covered the membranes for both conditions data not shown the biofilm thickness was the main factor affecting the fouling pressure it also shows that the membrane fouling mostly depend on the physical biofilm thickness similarly the biofilm relative roughness of the wt reactor was 3 2 vs 3 0 for the mt but the difference was not statistically significant t test p 0 34 previous research showed that biofilm growth under pressure decreases surface roughness derlon et al 2014 desmond et al 2018 dreszer et al 2014 jafari et al 2019 therefore the biofilm growth under the positive hydraulic pressure might explain the similar biofilm roughness of wt and mt for mbr system this is consistent with the finding that relative roughness values of wt and mt for the mbr were much smaller than those for the mabr which was exposed to the negligible hydraulic pressure similarly there was an insignificant difference of effluent scod between wt and mt although the high cell density mt biofilms showed better effluent scod 454 mg l than the low cell density wt biofilms 470 mg l the difference was not statistically significant t test p 0 34 a possible explanation is the oxygen limitation of the mbr system the oxygen concentration in the air sparged media was around 8 26 mgo2 l at 25 c which was not enough for the influent cod concentration 600 mg l the mbr with mt and wt biofilms consumed 146 and 130 cod respectively this means that the most oxygen used for the cod consumption was not from the oxygen in influent media it is plausible that oxygen consumed in biofilms diffused from the atmosphere through the membrane to the biofilms through the plastic mesh and membrane since the oxygen transport through the mesh was passive and slow the mbr biofilms were exposed by the oxygen limiting condition throughout the study therefore the wt and mt mbrs had negligible differences in effluent scod the high cell density mt biofilms made a significant difference in the running time of mbr reactor t test p 0 01 the running time of the wt reactor was around 70 higher than that of the mt reactor since mt biofilms produce less eps it would take longer to reach the fouling thickness resulting in the increased running time the membrane fouling and the decreased running time are the main limitation of the mbr system meng et al 2017 the extended running time of the mt reactor which had substrate removals similar to the wt reactor can reduce operating costs also mt biofilms in mbr showed lower mechanical stability than the wt biofilms t test p 10 4 for storage modulus and p 10 4 for loss modulus the impaired mechanical properties could be beneficial at mbr system by making backwashing more efficient in membrane cleaning processes weakened biofilms are more vulnerable to detachment in our research we reduced eps production in the mutant biofilm by reducing the formation of a specific polysaccharide pel it is possible that the difference in eps composition could have affected reactor performance however eps composition is highly variable in practice and there is little evidence that it has an important effect on the performance of mabrs or mbrs for contaminant removal in contrast it is well known that biofilm density can have an important effect on reactor performance thus we believe that the lower level of eps formation in the mutant leading to higher density biofilms the pel deletion may have affected traits beyond the reduced production of eps but none were observed and as mentioned above we believe it is reasonable to attribute the difference in performance to differences in the overall amount of eps formation 4 4 application of genetically engineered organisms geo in biological wastewater treatment in many disciplines geos are used to improve biological processes such as a biofuel production radakovits et al 2010 heavy metal removal deng et al 2003 deng et al 2007 duprey et al 2014 toxic chemical monitoring bhuvaneshwari et al 2019 schirmer et al 2018 and biorefinery perez et al 2019 perez et al 2022 despite the promising advantages the application of geos in biological wastewater treatment is limited one important hurdle is the potential impact of geos on natural ecosystems the release of geos into ecosystems may result in genetic pollution which means the uncontrolled gene flow from geos into natural populations ellstrand 2001 godheja 2013 this can be detrimental to natural organisms and lead to the evolution of harmful species auer 2008 hur et al 2011 phillips 2008 snow and palma 1997 these risks can be avoided by using closed systems the mbr could be a good candidate as the membrane can completely block the release of geos however the breakage of membranes and backwashing water present risks an additional disinfection system such as uv or chlorine can help mitigate this risk in addition research assessing the effects of the newly designed geo on natural ecosystems should precede their use another hurdle is ensuring that geos within the treatment process are not outcompeted by natural microbial communities or that geos lose their modified genes fujita et al 1991 therefore a selective pressure strategy for geos is desirable a traditional strategy is to insert an antibiotic resistance gene to the geo park et al 2003 for example a membrane coated with antibiotic metals such as silver mercury or copper can be used to provide selective pressure for geos with metal resistance genes however the addition of antibiotic genes could spread antibiotic resistance karkman et al 2018 another potential strategy is to exploit the fact that low eps producing organisms may have higher yields and growth rates than conventional bacteria as show in this study choosing the design parameters giving a selective pressure to the geo could help maintain its dominance in bioreactors 5 conclusions the major findings of this research are eliminating pel polysaccharide resulted in higher growth kinetics of p aeruginosa in controlled reactor systems eliminating pel polysaccharide increased the bacterial cell density in developed biofilms the biofilms without pel production were mechanically weaker which was disadvantageous for mabrs but advantageous for mbrs for the mabr eliminating pel polysaccharide production reduced the effluent solids and organics concentrations but the biofilms were mechanically weaker for the mbr eliminating pel polysaccharide production extended the reactor running time the observed mechanically weaker biofilms may allow for more efficient backwashing these results show that p aeruginosa biofilms without pel polysaccharide may improve the performance of mabrs and mbrs for practical application of the findings it is essential to address the effects of the geo culture on the natural environment also future research should address strategies to maintain the dominance of low eps cultures in the reactors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
