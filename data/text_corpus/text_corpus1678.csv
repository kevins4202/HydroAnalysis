the goal of a hydrological model is to accurately represent the hydrological systems in order to evaluate the impact assessment and risk evaluation related to water resources management in a river basin donelly makowecki and moore 1999 this involves the simplification of the real world system by means of mathematical equations and assumptions concurrently with input and forcing data model parameters and their initial values gupta et al 1998 each hydrological model has its constraints in terms of the number of input data spatial variability representation calibration parameters and duration in particular some hydrological models have been developed to represent a simplified representation relationship and transformation of precipitation into runoff singh and woolhiser 2002 narasayya et al 2013 these so called rainfall runoff models are created to characterize the physical components of a basin by assuming a simplified rainfall runoff relationship without explicit representation of the spatial variability in topography vegetation and soil properties the advantage of these models is that they require fewer input data additionally they are simpler to set up and have fewer calibration parameters as a consequence they are widely used for operational applications lampert and wu 2015 narasayya et al 2013 as well as for investigating the future changes in climate and land use beven 2011 in this type of model the parameters selection is restricted to a predefined range in order to achieve a realistic representation of the basin properties sorooshian and gupta 1995 furthermore these parameters are indirectly estimated using calibration and optimization procedures gupta et al 1998 the best model parameter sets during the calibration procedures are benchmarked on objective functions which indicate the degree of numerical agreement between basin observations and model simulations previous researches e g lu et al 2013 duan 2003 illustrate that calibrations based on a single objective function are effective for emphasizing a definite characteristic of a system however causing increasing errors in other characteristics of the system wagener 2003 in hydrological simulations for instance a calibration based on an objective function fine tunes the model simulation in favour of the predetermined objective function which does not assure a better simulation with other objective function a multi objective calibration method seeks to address this limitation by quantifying the adjustments in maximizing or minimizing a number of objective functions finding a representative set of the pareto optimal solutions as well as defining a single solution that maximizes or minimizes a specific independent preference gupta et al 2009 van werkhoven et al 2009 according to yapo et al 1998 multi objective calibrations are of great advantage as it ensures desired outcomes in hydrological applications a detailed report of the advantages of this technique is summarized in efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 thenceforth many hydrological studies have applied this technique by weighing various objective functions foglia et al 2009 li et al 2010 population based search method and pareto set search bekele and nicklow 2007 dumedah et al 2010 in similar attempts rakovec et al 2016 calibrated the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm kumar et al 2013 over 83 european basins using the multi scale parameter regionalization approach for improved physiographic and hydrologic regimes ning et al 2015 calibrated the hydrological predictions for the environment model lindstrom et al 2010 over the da river basin of vietnam using the differential evolution markov chain monte carlo braak 2006 step wise calibration method werth et al 2009 applied the multi objective calibration framework of non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 nsgaii to calibrate the watergap global hydrology model doll et al 2003 over the congo basin in africa the amazon basin in south america and the mississippi basin of north america xie et al 2012 calibrated the soil and water assessment tool model arnold and fohrer 2005 using the nsgaii technique to assess the total water storage variability over sub saharan africa basins while previous studies established the advantages of using multiple objective functions over a single criterion they do not consider the effect of using combined multi optimization procedures and multiple objective functions on model parameters set the advantage of using various optimization methods lies in its ability to assess quality phases of the optimized solutions such as their accuracies diversities and cardinalities riquelme et al 2015 in order to reduce the errors being propagated by the use of single objective function as well as generating good optimized solutions for the model parameter sets this study attempts to calibrate a 5 parameter daily lumped rainfall runoff model i e le modèle du génie rural à 5 paramètres au pas de temps journalier gr5j coron et al 2017 over the komadugu yobe basin kyb in west africa using a combined multi optimization procedures and multiple objective functions a detailed description of the study area is given in section 2 the gr5j model the calibration and optimization methods are presented in section 3 results are provided in section 4 followed by a summary and conclusion in section 5 2 study area and data the kyb is a transboundary basin shared by niger republic and nigeria and has area coverage of 150 000 km2 fig 1 it is a sub basin of the larger lake chad basin it is predominantly dominated by scattered trees dense grass and shrubs adeyeri et al 2017 the recurrent migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz creates highly seasonal rainfall accustomed by very strong convective storms the rainy season is between may and october thompson and polet 2000 the maximum temperature varies between 27 c in the southern part and 35 c in the northern part of the basin while the mean annual rainfall varies between 240 mm in the northern part and 1060 mm in the southern part adeyeri et al 2017 the annual potential evaporation varies between 1800 mm and 2400 mm while the evaporation rate is 203 mm per annum adeyeri et al 2019a the basin is principally drained by the komadugu yobe and the komadugu gana river sub systems august is the wettest month while annual flow ends in late september the kyb is strategic because its wetlands are sources to some internationally shared waters which are important for both national and international economy the climate data used for driving the gr5j namely precipitation and temperature is provided by direction de la meteorologie nationale dmn of the niger republic and nigeria meteorological agency nimet archived at daily time steps outliers and negative rainfall values are corrected with a quality control procedure homogeneity checking and correction is done using a multi break method based adapted caussinus mestre algorithm for homogenising networks of temperature series acmant a comprehensive report on acmant set up can be found in domonkos and coll 2017 results from previous studies e g domonkos and coll 2017 barbara et al 2018 adeyeri et al 2019b show that acmant performs well in homogenising climate variables rainfall relative humidity and temperature the potential evapotranspiration is calculated using oudin et al 2005 approach the daily runoff data is provided by the diffa hydrological station the analysis period is between 1971 and 2013 3 hydrological model calibration and optimization methods in this section the gr5j model as well as the multi objective and the multi optimization methods are described the schematic of the methodology is presented in fig 2 3 1 the gr5j model the gr5j model le moine 2008 lavenne et al 2016 is a rainfall runoff model that focuses on soil moisture partition the general model structure is presented in fig 3 five model parameters can be calibrated namely the maximum capacity production store x1 mm and a maximum capacity routing store x3 mm which are the two store compartments fed by the time base of a unit hydrograph x4 days the two other parameters i e the inter catchment exchange coefficient x2 mm d and the inter catchment exchange threshold x5 which quantifies the inter catchment groundwater ﬂows x1 and x2 are connected to water balance table 1 the degree day snow module valéry et al 2014 is not activated in this study as there is no snow in our application study x1 and x3 are positive real numbers x2 accepts both positive and negative numbers while x4 is always greater than 0 5 perrin et al 2003 the inputs for the model are precipitation and evapotranspiration additionally the ordinary krigging method li and heap 2014 is used to calculate the area mean basin rainfall 3 2 multi objective calibration multi objective model calibration is based on objective functions suitable for various hydrological processes such as peak flows general and low flows madsen 2000 this reduces the errors being propagated by the use of a single objective function a multi objective calibration problem can be expressed as 1 m i n f 1 f 2 f m where f m are the different objective functions is the model parameters while is the parameter space the model parameters are restricted to physically plausible parameter space the upper and lower bounds of the model parameters are specified as a hypercube function of the parameter space eq 1 reaches a pareto set of solutions given an optimal trade off among the different objective functions gupta et al 2003 the multi objective method selected for this study consists minimizing the root mean square error and maximizing both the nash sutcliffe and the kling gupta efficiencies the root mean square error rmse is a commonly used statistic that provides a good overall measure of how close modelled values are to predicted values 2 r m s e i 1 n m i o i 2 n 2 where oi represents the ith observed value and mi represents the ith model value for a total of n observations the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse compares the relative magnitude of the residual variance to observation variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 n s e i 1 n q o q a v 2 i 1 n q o q s 2 i 1 n q o q a v 2 qo is the observed discharge qav is the average observed discharge qs is the simulated discharge nse varies between and 1 with the optimum value being 1 however due to the quadratic nature of nse it provides information on the model s ability to simulate high flows nse can also return optimum values as a result of periodicity thereby providing a misleading interpretation of the model s ability as a result of these lapses many studies e g mathevet et al 2006 criss and winston 2008 decomposed the nse into a ratio of standard deviations αnse relative bias βnse and the ratio of the correlation coefficient r gupta et al 2009 showed that optimizing αnse underestimates the variability of simulated flows because the optimum nse is attained when αnse r in view of this gupta et al 2009 and kling et al 2012 recommended the kling gupta efficiency kge in order to circumvent the connections between the variation coefficient and bias and ratios 4 k g e 1 r c 1 2 β k g e 1 2 γ k g e 1 2 where rc is the linear pearson correlation coefficient β k g e is the bias and γ k g e is the variation coefficient ratio 3 3 multi optimization methods in this study six different multi optimization methods are used for the calibration of the model parameters the results of the multi optimization technique provide a set of solutions which concurrently optimize conflicting objective functions in a population set leading to a pareto optimal solution of the model parameters savic 2002 the six methods are briefly explained in the following 3 3 1 particle swarm optimization pso the pso is a population based stochastic global optimization procedure kennedy and eberhart 1995 in this method the population of potential solutions is called a swarm while particles are the members of the swarm these particles change positions in a multi dimensional search space depending on the position of other particles in the swarm as well as their own relative positioning the process involves the adjustment of the system based on a set of arbitrary solutions while the optimization search is maintained as the generations are updated the history of the best positions of the particles is retained by the neighbouring particles while considering their ﬁtness level after each iteration this helps in refining the ﬁnal solution the process reaches finest optimization when all particles converge the advantages of this method include its ability to converge fast high efficiency in finding global optimal and its ability to run parallel computation the disadvantages include its ability to converge prematurely and subsequently be stuck into a local minimum further details can be found in clerc and kennedy 2002 while this method has been widely used in fields like neuro computing and some environmental science field it is scarcely used in hydrology 3 3 2 shuffled complex evolution with rosenbrock s function sce r the advantage of this method lies in its ability to combine both local and global optimization techniques it starts with a direct local search rosenbrock 1960 when the value of the objective function is decreasing the length of the search vector is increased in order to have an optimum solution the iteration stops when the initial parameter setting is retained a new minimum is reached or all axes are explored the global search combines the shuffling of complexes i e partitioning the sample points from a population into distinct groups competitive evolution and controlled random search with simplex search duan et al 1992 1993 these enhance information sharing about the search space created individually by each complex however iteration takes time on instances of many parameters while trying to maintain a satisfactory level of diversity this method has been used widely to locate the global optimum for rainfall runoff models cooper et al 2007 goswami and kieran 2007 3 3 3 memetic algorithms with local search chains mals mals is a steady state memetic algorithm with improved genetic algorithms per local search techniques molina et al 2010 they are particularly suitable for uninterrupted optimization as they combine the strength of evolutionary algorithms with a local search routine to ﬁnd the local optimum of a likely region i e it combines both local and global optimization techniques the local search intensity is increased to get the most likely solution in mals the worst solution is substituted in the population instead of substituting every individual after iterations this retains the improvement of the solution after the local search bergmeir et al 2016 and subsequently controls the local search procedure to the most likely solutions however this method does not perform well if the numbers of parameters to optimize are many 3 3 4 differential evolution de de is based on a global population stochastic search procedure suitable to ﬁnd the global optimum in a continuous search domain storn and price 1997 de does not require derivatives of the objective function in de procedure a good optimized solution requires a trial and error search to adjust its related parameter values this method is useful in conditions where the objective functions are difficult to differentiate however de is inefficient on smooth functions which are mostly derivative based this method has been successfully applied for pattern recognition ilonen et al 2003 communications storn 1996 and engineering joshi and sanderson 1999 details of this method are presented in qin et al 2010 3 3 5 bayesian markov chain monte carlo simulation mcmc this method uses an adaptive metropolis algorithm and a delayed rejection procedure in implementing a markov chain monte carlo simulation mcmc aims to generate parameter values samples by simulating random processes having the posterior distribution as stationary distribution this posterior distribution is the probability distribution on the parameter space mcmc further explores the posterior distribution by creating random processes with stationary distribution as the parameters posterior distribution the new parameters in the adaptive metropolis are created with a covariance matrix which adjusts to the size and shape of the object distribution this permits a more proficient posterior distribution exploration the new parameters generated during delayed rejection are from the scaled covariance matrix jump arising from the last accepted value this preserves the reversibility of the markov chain advantages of the mcmc include its computational and statistical efficiency additionally tuning the scheme does not require trial runs however scaling is poor when there is an infinite target distribution variance this is not revealed during the inspection of the target density which makes it difficult to detect analytically furthermore it takes time for mcmc to recover from distorted preliminary information because it adapts too closely to the preliminary information from the output details are documented in haario et al 2005 2006 3 3 6 local optimization multi start approach loms the local optimization multi start approach loms is a simple bounded and box constrained general optimization technique gay 1990 in loms the performance of optimization is affected by scale vector chosen in computing the sample s trial values and in testing the convergence of parameters this strategy requires setting up the start point in transformed parameter space however the multi start approach assesses the consistency in the local optimization method the downside of this method is that it is bounded by the value ranges of the initial parameters the details of this method are documented in gay 1990 3 4 modelling strategy to ascertain the robustness of the optimization techniques calibration methods and model output the analysis period is divided into two episodes table 2 this provides worthwhile information on the model s ability to replicate the runoff at different times the calibration period for episode 1 is between 1974 and 2000 and the validation period is between 2001 and 2013 while episode 2 has the calibration period between 1980 and 1995 and the validation period is between 1996 and 2011 in calibrating the gr5j model the initial model parameters are fine tuned with a set of trial and error experiments before the start of the optimization objectives in the modelling set up each optimization technique is run separately in the hydrological model using the multi objective calibration technique for each calibration and validation periods the number of iteration and simulation needed for each model parameter to converge for each optimization method is reported furthermore the properties of the runoff generated with each optimization techniques are analysed and compared with the observation 3 5 time frequency wavelet the transient behaviour of the runoff is examined with time frequency wavelet analysis the wavelet transform decomposes signals in a way in which the signal trends and details are represented as a function of time this shows areas with high common power in the time frequency space i e a transient and localized behaviour at different time scales the wavelet power spectrum of the runoff local covariance across different time scales is generated based on the wavelet energy stress of the time series veleda et al 2012 adeyeri et al 2019a the advantage of this transformation lies in its ability to deconstruct complex signals into basic signals of finite bandwidth without a phase shifting or signal leakage of the primary signal 3 6 numerical performance metrics the numerical performance metrics used for evaluation of the entire calibration and validation periods are the mean absolute error mae the mean square error mse the normalized root mean square error nrmse the percentage of bias pbias yapo et al 1996 the ratio of root mean square error to the standard deviation rsr moriasi et al 2007 the index of agreement d legates and mccabe 1999 and the volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 4 results and discussion in this section the results of the multi objective optimization approaches are described further results include the model parameters convergence flow characteristics performance metrics as well as the wavelet decomposition of the simulated runoff 4 1 multi objective optimization calibration the summary of the multi objective optimization computation is presented in table 3 it is observed that the global optimization approach of mals exhibits the highest number of iterations while the pso has the highest number of simulations for both calibration episodes this agrees with sahoo et al 2010 who emphasised that global optimisation techniques require more computing resources the lowest iterations and simulations are exhibited by the sce r approach in all cases seong et al 2015 the optimum model parameters generated during calibration for each optimization method table 4 is used in running the model during validation for the two episodes the result for the first episode shows that sce r de pso and mals methods have the nse kge and rmse of 0 89 0 81 and 0 24 respectively for the calibration period 1974 2000 while the validation period 2001 2013 seem to be an improvement over the calibration period the nse kge and rmse generated during this period are 0 91 0 84 and 0 23 respectively the correlation plot for the calibration period 1974 2000 for the first episode fig 4 a shows the simulated runoff generated by pso optimization method has the highest correlation with the observed runoff qobs with a value of 0 79 however there is a degree of correlation between simulated runoff generated by all optimization algorithms the correlation plot for the validation period 2001 2013 shows a high degree of correlation between the observed runoff and the simulated runoff from sce r de pso and mals optimization methods fig 4b nevertheless sce r optimization method has the highest correlation value of 0 73 while mcmc has the lowest value of 0 67 consequently the interactions among the three different objectives resulted in a pareto optimal solution savic 2002 the graphical comparison of the simulated runoff with observed runoff for the entire period of calibration and validation demonstrates a degree of representativeness and agreement with the observed runoff however for a sub set period of calibration 1999 2000 and validation 2001 2002 there are some overestimations of the peak by some optimization techniques e g mcmc and the underestimation of the base flow by some other optimization techniques e g sce r and de fig 5 in contrast mcmc represents the base flow well the anomaly fig 5 shows the deviations of the simulated run off from the observed runoff the highest deviation is seen in mcmc result while the lowest is seen in de and sce r however the degree of anomaly seems to be lesser during the validation period furthermore sce r de pso and mals returned reasonable optimized objective functions for both calibration and validation periods table 4 for the second episode of the calibration 1980 1995 table 4 the results show that sce r de pso and mals provide the best parameters they have the nse kge and rmse values of 0 89 0 79 and 0 23 respectively this agrees with jain and srinivasulu 2009 who stated that the genetic algorithms are efficient for hydrologic model calibration loms and mcmc have lower nse and kge values this same behaviour is exhibited during the validation period 1996 2011 in both cases loms and mcmc have the lowest performance it is worthy to note that changing the calibration episodes has little to no effect on the generated model parameters for example in sce r method for both calibration episodes x1 is between 100 25 101 78 mm x2 is between 14 96 to 14 98 mm while x3 x4 and x5 do not change for mals x1 does not change x2 ranges from 14 95 to 14 96 mm x3 is from 998 68 1000 14 mm while x4 and x5 do not change the range of these similar calibration parameters during both episodes for the different optimization techniques shows the robustness of the calibration efficiencies of these methods furthermore the applied calibration methods show reasonable abilities to simulate runoff with a satisfactory level of accuracy hence multi objective calibrations are of great advantage as it ensures desired outcomes in hydrological applications yapo et al 1998 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 mostafaie et al 2018 additionally table 4 also shows that different parameters can produce a very similar objective function for example parameter x1 varies from 100 25 for sce r to 800 95 for mcmc whereas parameter x3 varies from 1000 52 for sce r to 200 35 for mcmc this is a compensating process leading to the well known phenomena of equifinality ambiguity non uniqueness and identifiability of parameters beven 2006 stated that during hydrological simulations acceptable good fits are regularly located beyond the pareto optima regions this may be linked to the different parameterisation processes of hydrological systems as observed in the hydrological model poissant et al 2017 therefore the uncertainties associated with the hydrological model s parameterisation processes do not permit a solitary or explicit mathematical solution to parameters identiﬁcation problem beck 1987 beven 2006 this is uncertainty in flow forecast however the issue of equifinality can be reduced by improving the parameterisation schemes of the model as well as the model structures and parameter values therefore equifinality is this context is seen as finding multiple practical hypotheses about how the system works beven 2002 4 2 convergence of model parameters the assessment of the model parameters convergence shows the number of iterations needed for the model parameters to converge towards a good optimized solution to evaluate these convergences the parameters are transformed into real space and analysed based on the trade off between computational period and simulation accuracy according to madsen 2000 2003 the parameter space limits are based on the model s physical and mathematical constraints physical features of the system and simulation trials as an illustration the convergence for model parameters generated from the de optimization method is presented in fig 6 the result shows that x4 converges faster than the rest of the parameters x4 converges at about 30 iterations while the slowest converging parameter is x1 which do not converge at 200 iterations this means that it takes longer for every individual in the x1 population to be identical in order to reach an optimized solution hence the computation time is prolonged the results for other optimization methods are presented in the supplementary file 4 3 flow characteristics in an attempt to further understand the hydrological properties of the basin as simulated by individual optimization methods the statistics of the base flow and high flow spells is computed the base flow separation method follows ladson et al 2013 4 3 1 baseflow in table 5 the base flow is generated for both calibration and validation periods for the two phases for calibration period sce r de mals and pso clearly overestimate the mean daily base flow by 0 06 mm day while loms and mcmc underestimate it by 0 07 mm day the overestimation by sce r de pso mals and the underestimation by loms and mcmc is seen to persist for the median daily base flow and mean base flow volume for the validation period sce r de pso and mals continue to overestimate the base flow parameters while loms and mcmc continue with the underestimation 4 3 2 high flow spells the number of high flow spell events is underestimated by sce r de pso mals while loms and mcmc overestimate it for both calibration and validation period table 6 however the highest overestimation is seen loms 112 during calibration and in mcmc 52 during validation the same trend is repeated for the spell event frequency loms and mcmc underestimate the maximum duration of high flow spell days during calibration by 2 days while sce r de pso and mals overestimate it by 13 days during validation all optimization methods underestimate this event by at least 11 days the average annual maximum flows and flood skewness the ratio of average annual maximum to mean daily flow is overestimated by all methods during calibration and validation periods the highest overestimation in flood skewness is by loms during the calibration period 12 43 and mcmc during the validation period 11 23 all calibration techniques fairly predict the correct average day of the year on which maximum flows occur during the calibration period with a degree of 2 days however loms and mcmc overestimate it by 5 days during the validation period generally multi objective calibration is seen to have reliable applications to multi variable measurements and multi response approaches to various hydrological processes e g the low and peak flows madsen 2003 mostafaie et al 2018 4 4 performance metrics the summary of the numerical performance metrics for each of the optimization technique implemented is shown in fig 7 the performance metric is for the entire calibration and validation period the performance evaluation shows that mcmc has the highest values of mean absolute error 0 28 and mean square error 0 40 while loms and mcmc record a low volumetric efficiency of 0 56 fig 7 this means that these two optimization techniques mismatch the fractional volume of water delivered per unit time however all other techniques perform better in the fraction of water delivered when evaluated against different performance metrics it is evident that several parameters returned equally good model outputs mostafaie et al 2018 4 5 joint time frequency signal the wavelet spectra plot of the runoff variance across different time scales for the first simulation phase 1974 2013 shows slight differences in the results of the optimization techniques fig 8 the wavelet coefficients estimates are only reliable in the areas within the cone of influence i e the solid black lines which represent the 95 confidence level for the observation obs there is 3 4 years periodicity of high frequency power from 1974 to 1992 however this periodicity is only significant between 1979 1992 and 2005 2008 the highest wavelet power of between 11 and 12 years is captured by all techniques this high periodicity is assumed to be caused by high rainfall variability as well as the impact of human activities in the runoff in the basin nicholson 2001 umar and ankidawa 2016 adeyeri et al 2018 furthermore the significant power between 1989 and 1997 in the obs is underestimated by de pso mals and loms methods these phenomena are captured by different optimization techniques likewise the span of significant powers varies from one method to the other for example mals underestimated the span of powers while mcmc overestimated it a dominant episode of significant power between 6 and 7 years is observed between 1990 and 2000 this is accurately replicated by the sce r while other techniques apart from mcmc underestimated it furthermore the wavelet phases blue arrows are accurately captured by all techniques arrows pointing up down show a lead lag of 90 from the first time series to the second time series if the time series move together there is a zero phase difference if the arrows are pointing left right it means the time series are anti phase in phase i e negatively positively correlated in general the magnitude of the wavelet coefficient is accurately represented by all optimization techniques 4 6 implications for the kyb and the lake chad the kyb is a sub basin of the larger lake chad basin it represents 35 of the lake chad basin its rivers contribute significantly to the lake chad therefore the hydrology and ecosystem of the kyb particularly influence the drying or recovery of the lake chad over the past decades the kyb had witnessed episodes of drought and rainfall recovery thompson and polet 2000 adeyeri et al 2019b this had led to the modification of the hydrological regimes and systems since these systems are complex there is a need for an accurate representation of the basin s hydrological features on the representation of base flow this maintains the water quality river s biodiversity productivity and aquatic species migration by influencing the surface channel and the hyporheic zones malcolm et al 2004 thus an accurate representation of the baseflow is important for making relevant decisions for sustainable biodiversity management environmental policies river restoration as well as functional aquatic ecosystem preservation hitchman et al 2018 in the same vein the high flow could potentially maintain the food chain balance by reviving the wetlands in the basin adeyeri et al 2019a this will also replenish lake chad on the other hand excess water from continuous high flow spell could cause flooding consequently affecting properties farm produce and farmlands hence the water resource will be greatly stressed while the socio economic activity will be hampered according to cook et al 2015 the warming climate could aggravate the stress on freshwater resources hence to accurately manage the freshwater resources a proper representation of the hydrological system is essential especially in the face of changing climate 5 summary and conclusion different multi objective and multi optimization techniques have been evaluated in this study for the gr5j hydrological model applied to the case of the komadugu yobe basin kyb the calibration process involved the use of six evolutionary optimization methods sce r de pso mals loms and mcmc and three combined objective functions i e minimizing rmse maximizing both nse and kge the robustness of the calibration approaches was validated by considering two episodes 1974 2013 and 1980 2011 for the analysis the applied calibration methods showed reasonable abilities to simulate runoff with a satisfactory level of accuracy the results of the flow statistics were not universally consistent as some optimization methods overestimate while others continually underestimate the flow representation for example mcmc underestimated the maximum duration of high flow spell by 2 days while mals overestimated it by 13 days for the particular case of kyb we found that the de and the sce r methods performed best the multi objective computational assessment for each optimization methods to reach the optimal pareto solutions showed that mals exhibits the highest number of iterations while the pso had the highest number of simulations for both calibration periods the lowest iterations and simulations were exhibited by the sce r approach in all cases comparing the computational period and the performance metric of sce r indicates the trade off balance between computational period and simulation accuracy based on these evaluations it is concluded that the combination of multi objective functions and multi optimization techniques for optimal pareto sets for gr5j model parameters over the kyb do not only improve the stability of the model parameters during calibration but also improve the optimization ability of the calibration algorithms towards more accurate and robust representation of the river runoff in the basin furthermore the auto calibration method is more efficient as it circumvents the interference of anthropogenic factors as observed in manual calibrations madsen 2000 wu et al 2017 future work should incorporate more methodologies to ascertaining the different sources of uncertainty in model parameters model structure and input dataset as well as error structure and probabilities especially during calibration declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the

the goal of a hydrological model is to accurately represent the hydrological systems in order to evaluate the impact assessment and risk evaluation related to water resources management in a river basin donelly makowecki and moore 1999 this involves the simplification of the real world system by means of mathematical equations and assumptions concurrently with input and forcing data model parameters and their initial values gupta et al 1998 each hydrological model has its constraints in terms of the number of input data spatial variability representation calibration parameters and duration in particular some hydrological models have been developed to represent a simplified representation relationship and transformation of precipitation into runoff singh and woolhiser 2002 narasayya et al 2013 these so called rainfall runoff models are created to characterize the physical components of a basin by assuming a simplified rainfall runoff relationship without explicit representation of the spatial variability in topography vegetation and soil properties the advantage of these models is that they require fewer input data additionally they are simpler to set up and have fewer calibration parameters as a consequence they are widely used for operational applications lampert and wu 2015 narasayya et al 2013 as well as for investigating the future changes in climate and land use beven 2011 in this type of model the parameters selection is restricted to a predefined range in order to achieve a realistic representation of the basin properties sorooshian and gupta 1995 furthermore these parameters are indirectly estimated using calibration and optimization procedures gupta et al 1998 the best model parameter sets during the calibration procedures are benchmarked on objective functions which indicate the degree of numerical agreement between basin observations and model simulations previous researches e g lu et al 2013 duan 2003 illustrate that calibrations based on a single objective function are effective for emphasizing a definite characteristic of a system however causing increasing errors in other characteristics of the system wagener 2003 in hydrological simulations for instance a calibration based on an objective function fine tunes the model simulation in favour of the predetermined objective function which does not assure a better simulation with other objective function a multi objective calibration method seeks to address this limitation by quantifying the adjustments in maximizing or minimizing a number of objective functions finding a representative set of the pareto optimal solutions as well as defining a single solution that maximizes or minimizes a specific independent preference gupta et al 2009 van werkhoven et al 2009 according to yapo et al 1998 multi objective calibrations are of great advantage as it ensures desired outcomes in hydrological applications a detailed report of the advantages of this technique is summarized in efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 thenceforth many hydrological studies have applied this technique by weighing various objective functions foglia et al 2009 li et al 2010 population based search method and pareto set search bekele and nicklow 2007 dumedah et al 2010 in similar attempts rakovec et al 2016 calibrated the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm kumar et al 2013 over 83 european basins using the multi scale parameter regionalization approach for improved physiographic and hydrologic regimes ning et al 2015 calibrated the hydrological predictions for the environment model lindstrom et al 2010 over the da river basin of vietnam using the differential evolution markov chain monte carlo braak 2006 step wise calibration method werth et al 2009 applied the multi objective calibration framework of non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 nsgaii to calibrate the watergap global hydrology model doll et al 2003 over the congo basin in africa the amazon basin in south america and the mississippi basin of north america xie et al 2012 calibrated the soil and water assessment tool model arnold and fohrer 2005 using the nsgaii technique to assess the total water storage variability over sub saharan africa basins while previous studies established the advantages of using multiple objective functions over a single criterion they do not consider the effect of using combined multi optimization procedures and multiple objective functions on model parameters set the advantage of using various optimization methods lies in its ability to assess quality phases of the optimized solutions such as their accuracies diversities and cardinalities riquelme et al 2015 in order to reduce the errors being propagated by the use of single objective function as well as generating good optimized solutions for the model parameter sets this study attempts to calibrate a 5 parameter daily lumped rainfall runoff model i e le modèle du génie rural à 5 paramètres au pas de temps journalier gr5j coron et al 2017 over the komadugu yobe basin kyb in west africa using a combined multi optimization procedures and multiple objective functions a detailed description of the study area is given in section 2 the gr5j model the calibration and optimization methods are presented in section 3 results are provided in section 4 followed by a summary and conclusion in section 5 2 study area and data the kyb is a transboundary basin shared by niger republic and nigeria and has area coverage of 150 000 km2 fig 1 it is a sub basin of the larger lake chad basin it is predominantly dominated by scattered trees dense grass and shrubs adeyeri et al 2017 the recurrent migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz creates highly seasonal rainfall accustomed by very strong convective storms the rainy season is between may and october thompson and polet 2000 the maximum temperature varies between 27 c in the southern part and 35 c in the northern part of the basin while the mean annual rainfall varies between 240 mm in the northern part and 1060 mm in the southern part adeyeri et al 2017 the annual potential evaporation varies between 1800 mm and 2400 mm while the evaporation rate is 203 mm per annum adeyeri et al 2019a the basin is principally drained by the komadugu yobe and the komadugu gana river sub systems august is the wettest month while annual flow ends in late september the kyb is strategic because its wetlands are sources to some internationally shared waters which are important for both national and international economy the climate data used for driving the gr5j namely precipitation and temperature is provided by direction de la meteorologie nationale dmn of the niger republic and nigeria meteorological agency nimet archived at daily time steps outliers and negative rainfall values are corrected with a quality control procedure homogeneity checking and correction is done using a multi break method based adapted caussinus mestre algorithm for homogenising networks of temperature series acmant a comprehensive report on acmant set up can be found in domonkos and coll 2017 results from previous studies e g domonkos and coll 2017 barbara et al 2018 adeyeri et al 2019b show that acmant performs well in homogenising climate variables rainfall relative humidity and temperature the potential evapotranspiration is calculated using oudin et al 2005 approach the daily runoff data is provided by the diffa hydrological station the analysis period is between 1971 and 2013 3 hydrological model calibration and optimization methods in this section the gr5j model as well as the multi objective and the multi optimization methods are described the schematic of the methodology is presented in fig 2 3 1 the gr5j model the gr5j model le moine 2008 lavenne et al 2016 is a rainfall runoff model that focuses on soil moisture partition the general model structure is presented in

a unit hydrograph x4 days the two other parameters i e the inter catchment exchange coefficient x2 mm d and the inter catchment exchange threshold x5 which quantifies the inter catchment groundwater ﬂows x1 and x2 are connected to water balance table 1 the degree day snow module valéry et al 2014 is not activated in this study as there is no snow in our application study x1 and x3 are positive real numbers x2 accepts both positive and negative numbers while x4 is always greater than 0 5 perrin et al 2003 the inputs for the model are precipitation and evapotranspiration additionally the ordinary krigging method li and heap 2014 is used to calculate the area mean basin rainfall 3 2 multi objective calibration multi objective model calibration is based on objective functions suitable for various hydrological processes such as peak flows general and low flows madsen 2000 this reduces the errors being propagated by the use of a single objective function a multi objective calibration problem can be expressed as 1 m i n f 1 f 2 f m where f m are the different objective functions is the model parameters while is the parameter space the model parameters are restricted to physically plausible parameter space the upper and lower bounds of the model parameters are specified as a hypercube function of the parameter space eq 1 reaches a pareto set of solutions given an optimal trade off among the different objective functions gupta et al 2003 the multi objective method selected for this study consists minimizing the root mean square error and maximizing both the nash sutcliffe and the kling gupta efficiencies the root mean square error rmse is a commonly used statistic that provides a good overall measure of how close modelled values are to predicted values 2 r m s e i 1 n m i o i 2 n 2 where oi represents the ith observed value and mi represents the ith model value for a total of n observations the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse compares the relative magnitude of the residual variance to observation variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 3 n s e i 1 n q o q a v 2 i 1 n q o q s 2 i 1 n q o q a v 2 qo is the observed discharge qav is the average observed discharge qs is the simulated discharge nse varies between and 1 with the optimum value being 1 however due to the quadratic nature of nse it provides information on the model s ability to simulate high flows nse can also return optimum values as a result of periodicity thereby providing a misleading interpretation of the model s ability as a result of these lapses many studies e g mathevet et al 2006 criss and winston 2008 decomposed the nse into a ratio of standard deviations αnse relative bias βnse and the ratio of the correlation coefficient r gupta et al 2009 showed that optimizing αnse underestimates the variability of simulated flows because the optimum nse is attained when αnse r in view of this gupta et al 2009 and kling et al 2012 recommended the kling gupta efficiency kge in order to circumvent the connections between the variation coefficient and bias and ratios 4 k g e 1 r c 1 2 β k g e 1 2 γ k g e 1 2 where rc is the linear pearson correlation coefficient β k g e is the bias and γ k g e is the variation coefficient ratio 3 3 multi optimization methods in this study six different multi optimization methods are used for the calibration of the model parameters the results of the multi optimization technique provide a set of solutions which concurrently optimize conflicting objective functions in a population set leading to a pareto optimal solution of the model parameters savic 2002 the six methods are briefly explained in the following 3 3 1 particle swarm optimization pso the pso is a population based stochastic global optimization procedure kennedy and eberhart 1995 in this method the population of potential solutions is called a swarm while particles are the members of the swarm these particles change positions in a multi dimensional search space depending on the position of other particles in the swarm as well as their own relative positioning the process involves the adjustment of the system based on a set of arbitrary solutions while the optimization search is maintained as the generations are updated the history of the best positions of the particles is retained by the neighbouring particles while considering their ﬁtness level after each iteration this helps in refining the ﬁnal solution the process reaches finest optimization when all particles converge the advantages of this method include its ability to converge fast high efficiency in finding global optimal and its ability to run parallel computation the disadvantages include its ability to converge prematurely and subsequently be stuck into a local minimum further details can be found in clerc and kennedy 2002 while this method has been widely used in fields like neuro computing and some environmental science field it is scarcely used in hydrology 3 3 2 shuffled complex evolution with rosenbrock s function sce r the advantage of this method lies in its ability to combine both local and global optimization techniques it starts with a direct local search rosenbrock 1960 when the value of the objective function is decreasing the length of the search vector is increased in order to have an optimum solution the iteration stops when the initial parameter setting is retained a new minimum is reached or all axes are explored the global search combines the shuffling of complexes i e partitioning the sample points from a population into distinct groups competitive evolution and controlled random search with simplex search duan et al 1992 1993 these enhance information sharing about the search space created individually by each complex however iteration takes time on instances of many parameters while trying to maintain a satisfactory level of diversity this method has been used widely to locate the global optimum for rainfall runoff models cooper et al 2007 goswami and kieran 2007 3 3 3 memetic algorithms with local search chains mals mals is a steady state memetic algorithm with improved genetic algorithms per local search techniques molina et al 2010 they are particularly suitable for uninterrupted optimization as they combine the strength of evolutionary algorithms with a local search routine to ﬁnd the local optimum of a likely region i e it combines both local and global optimization techniques the local search intensity is increased to get the most likely solution in mals the worst solution is substituted in the population instead of substituting every individual after iterations this retains the improvement of the solution after the local search bergmeir et al 2016 and subsequently controls the local search procedure to the most likely solutions however this method does not perform well if the numbers of parameters to optimize are many 3 3 4 differential evolution de de is based on a global population stochastic search procedure suitable to ﬁnd the global optimum in a continuous search domain storn and price 1997 de does not require derivatives of the objective function in de procedure a good optimized solution requires a trial and error search to adjust its related parameter values this method is useful in conditions where the objective functions are difficult to differentiate however de is inefficient on smooth functions which are mostly derivative based this method has been successfully applied for pattern recognition ilonen et al 2003 communications storn 1996 and engineering joshi and sanderson 1999 details of this method are presented in qin et al 2010 3 3 5 bayesian markov chain monte carlo simulation mcmc this method uses an adaptive metropolis algorithm and a delayed rejection procedure in implementing a markov chain monte carlo simulation mcmc aims to generate parameter values samples by simulating random processes having the posterior distribution as stationary distribution this posterior distribution is the probability distribution on the parameter space mcmc further explores the posterior distribution by creating random processes with stationary distribution as the parameters posterior distribution the new parameters in the adaptive metropolis are created with a covariance matrix which adjusts to the size and shape of the object distribution this permits a more proficient posterior distribution exploration the new parameters generated during delayed rejection are from the scaled covariance matrix jump arising from the last accepted value this preserves the reversibility of the markov chain advantages of the mcmc include its computational and statistical efficiency additionally tuning the scheme does not require trial runs however scaling is poor when there is an infinite target distribution variance this is not revealed during the inspection of the target density which makes it difficult to detect analytically furthermore it takes time for mcmc to recover from distorted preliminary information because it adapts too closely to the preliminary information from the output details are documented in haario et al 2005 2006 3 3 6 local optimization multi start approach loms the local optimization multi start approach loms is a simple bounded and box constrained general optimization technique gay 1990 in loms the performance of optimization is affected by scale vector chosen in computing the sample s trial values and in testing the convergence of parameters this strategy requires setting up the start point in transformed parameter space however the multi start approach assesses the consistency in the local optimization method the downside of this method is that it is bounded by the value ranges of the initial parameters the details of this method are documented in gay 1990 3 4 modelling strategy to ascertain the robustness of the optimization techniques calibration methods and model output the analysis period is divided into two episodes table 2 this provides worthwhile information on the model s ability to replicate the runoff at different times the calibration period for episode 1 is between 1974 and 2000 and the validation period is between 2001 and 2013 while episode 2 has the calibration period between 1980 and 1995 and the validation period is between 1996 and 2011 in calibrating the gr5j model the initial model parameters are fine tuned with a set of trial and error experiments before the start of the optimization objectives in the modelling set up each optimization technique is run separately in the hydrological model using the multi objective calibration technique for each calibration and validation periods the number of iteration and simulation needed for each model parameter to converge for each optimization method is reported furthermore the properties of the runoff generated with each optimization techniques are analysed and compared with the observation 3 5 time frequency wavelet the transient behaviour of the runoff is examined with time frequency wavelet analysis the wavelet transform decomposes signals in a way in which the signal trends and details are represented as a function of time this shows areas with high common power in the time frequency space i e a transient and localized behaviour at different time scales the wavelet power spectrum of the runoff local covariance across different time scales is generated based on the wavelet energy stress of the time series veleda et al 2012 adeyeri et al 2019a the advantage of this transformation lies in its ability to deconstruct complex signals into basic signals of finite bandwidth without a phase shifting or signal leakage of the primary signal 3 6 numerical performance metrics the numerical performance metrics used for evaluation of the entire calibration and validation periods are the mean absolute error mae the mean square error mse the normalized root mean square error nrmse the percentage of bias pbias yapo et al 1996 the ratio of root mean square error to the standard deviation rsr moriasi et al 2007 the index of agreement d legates and mccabe 1999 and the volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 4 results and discussion in this section the results of the multi objective optimization approaches are described further results include the model parameters convergence flow characteristics performance metrics as well as the wavelet decomposition of the simulated runoff 4 1 multi objective optimization calibration the summary of the multi objective optimization computation is presented in table 3 it is observed that the global optimization approach of mals exhibits the highest number of iterations while the pso has the highest number of simulations for both calibration episodes this agrees with sahoo et al 2010 who emphasised that global optimisation techniques require more computing resources the lowest iterations and simulations are exhibited by the sce r approach in all cases seong et al 2015 the optimum model parameters generated during calibration for each optimization method table 4 is used in running the model during validation for the two episodes the result for the first episode shows that sce r de pso and mals methods have the nse kge and rmse of 0 89 0 81 and 0 24 respectively for the calibration period 1974 2000 while the validation period 2001 2013 seem to be an improvement over the calibration period the nse kge and rmse generated during this period are 0 91 0 84 and 0 23 respectively the correlation plot for the calibration period 1974 2000 for the first episode fig 4 a shows the simulated runoff generated by pso optimization method has the highest correlation with the observed runoff qobs with a value of 0 79 however there is a degree of correlation between simulated runoff generated by all optimization algorithms the correlation plot for the validation period 2001 2013 shows a high degree of correlation between the observed runoff and the simulated runoff from sce r de pso and mals optimization methods fig 4b nevertheless sce r optimization method has the highest correlation value of 0 73 while mcmc has the lowest value of 0 67 consequently the interactions among the three different objectives resulted in a pareto optimal solution savic 2002 the graphical comparison of the simulated runoff with observed runoff for the entire period of calibration and validation demonstrates a degree of representativeness and agreement with the observed runoff however for a sub set period of calibration 1999 2000 and validation 2001 2002 there are some overestimations of the peak by some optimization techniques e g mcmc and the underestimation of the base flow by some other optimization techniques e g sce r and de fig 5 in contrast mcmc represents the base flow well the anomaly fig 5 shows the deviations of the simulated run off from the observed runoff the highest deviation is seen in mcmc result while the lowest is seen in de and sce r however the degree of anomaly seems to be lesser during the validation period furthermore sce r de pso and mals returned reasonable optimized objective functions for both calibration and validation periods table 4 for the second episode of the calibration 1980 1995 table 4 the results show that sce r de pso and mals provide the best parameters they have the nse kge and rmse values of 0 89 0 79 and 0 23 respectively this agrees with jain and srinivasulu 2009 who stated that the genetic algorithms are efficient for hydrologic model calibration loms and mcmc have lower nse and kge values this same behaviour is exhibited during the validation period 1996 2011 in both cases loms and mcmc have the lowest performance it is worthy to note that changing the calibration episodes has little to no effect on the generated model parameters for example in sce r method for both calibration episodes x1 is between 100 25 101 78 mm x2 is between 14 96 to 14 98 mm while x3 x4 and x5 do not change for mals x1 does not change x2 ranges from 14 95 to 14 96 mm x3 is from 998 68 1000 14 mm while x4 and x5 do not change the range of these similar calibration parameters during both episodes for the different optimization techniques shows the robustness of the calibration efficiencies of these methods furthermore the applied calibration methods show reasonable abilities to simulate runoff with a satisfactory level of accuracy hence multi objective calibrations are of great advantage as it ensures desired outcomes in hydrological applications yapo et al 1998 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 mostafaie et al 2018 additionally table 4 also shows that different parameters can produce a very similar objective function for example parameter x1 varies from 100 25 for sce r to 800 95 for mcmc whereas parameter x3 varies from 1000 52 for sce r to 200 35 for mcmc this is a compensating process leading to the well known phenomena of equifinality ambiguity non uniqueness and identifiability of parameters beven 2006 stated that during hydrological simulations acceptable good fits are regularly located beyond the pareto optima regions this may be linked to the different parameterisation processes of hydrological systems as observed in the hydrological model poissant et al 2017 therefore the uncertainties associated with the hydrological model s parameterisation processes do not permit a solitary or explicit mathematical solution to parameters identiﬁcation problem beck 1987 beven 2006 this is uncertainty in flow forecast however the issue of equifinality can be reduced by improving the parameterisation schemes of the model as well as the model structures and parameter values therefore equifinality is this context is seen as finding multiple practical hypotheses about how the system works beven 2002 4 2 convergence of model parameters the assessment of the model parameters convergence shows the number of iterations needed for the model parameters to converge towards a good optimized solution to evaluate these convergences the parameters are transformed into real space and analysed based on the trade off between computational period and simulation accuracy according to madsen 2000 2003 the parameter space limits are based on the model s physical and mathematical constraints physical features of the system and simulation trials as an illustration the convergence for model parameters generated from the de optimization method is presented in fig 6 the result shows that x4 converges faster than the rest of the parameters x4 converges at about 30 iterations while the slowest converging parameter is x1 which do not converge at 200 iterations this means that it takes longer for every individual in the x1 population to be identical in order to reach an optimized solution hence the computation time is prolonged the results for other optimization methods are presented in the supplementary file 4 3 flow characteristics in an attempt to further understand the hydrological properties of the basin as simulated by individual optimization methods the statistics of the base flow and high flow spells is computed the base flow separation method follows ladson et al 2013 4 3 1 baseflow in table 5 the base flow is generated for both calibration and validation periods for the two phases for calibration period sce r de mals and pso clearly overestimate the mean daily base flow by 0 06 mm day while loms and mcmc underestimate it by 0 07 mm day the overestimation by sce r de pso mals and the underestimation by loms and mcmc is seen to persist for the median daily base flow and mean base flow volume for the validation period sce r de pso and mals continue to overestimate the base flow parameters while loms and mcmc continue with the underestimation 4 3 2 high flow spells the number of high flow spell events is underestimated by sce r de pso mals while loms and mcmc overestimate it for both calibration and validation period table 6 however the highest overestimation is seen loms 112 during calibration and in mcmc 52 during validation the same trend is repeated for the spell event frequency loms and mcmc underestimate the maximum duration of high flow spell days during calibration by 2 days while sce r de pso and mals overestimate it by 13 days during validation all optimization methods underestimate this event by at least 11 days the average annual maximum flows and flood skewness the ratio of average annual maximum to mean daily flow is overestimated by all methods during calibration and validation periods the highest overestimation in flood skewness is by loms during the calibration period 12 43 and mcmc during the validation period 11 23 all calibration techniques fairly predict the correct average day of the year on which maximum flows occur during the calibration period with a degree of 2 days however loms and mcmc overestimate it by 5 days during the validation period generally multi objective calibration is seen to have reliable applications to multi variable measurements and multi response approaches to various hydrological processes e g the low and peak flows madsen 2003 mostafaie et al 2018 4 4 performance metrics the summary of the numerical performance metrics for each of the optimization technique implemented is shown in fig 7 the performance metric is for the entire calibration and validation period the performance evaluation shows that mcmc has the highest values of mean absolute error 0 28 and mean square error 0 40 while loms and mcmc record a low volumetric efficiency of 0 56 fig 7 this means that these two optimization techniques mismatch the fractional volume of water delivered per unit time however all other techniques perform better in the fraction of water delivered when evaluated against different performance metrics it is evident that several parameters returned equally good model outputs mostafaie et al 2018 4 5 joint time frequency signal the wavelet spectra plot of the runoff variance across different time scales for the first simulation phase 1974 2013 shows slight differences in the results of the optimization techniques fig 8 the wavelet coefficients estimates are only reliable in the areas within the cone of influence i e the solid black lines which represent the 95 confidence level for the observation obs there is 3 4 years periodicity of high frequency power from 1974 to 1992 however this periodicity is only significant between 1979 1992 and 2005 2008 the highest wavelet power of between 11 and 12 years is captured by all techniques this high periodicity is assumed to be caused by high rainfall variability as well as the impact of human activities in the runoff in the basin nicholson 2001 umar and ankidawa 2016 adeyeri et al 2018 furthermore the significant power between 1989 and 1997 in the obs is underestimated by de pso mals and loms methods these phenomena are captured by different optimization techniques likewise the span of significant powers varies from one method to the other for example mals underestimated the span of powers while mcmc overestimated it a dominant episode of significant power between 6 and 7 years is observed between 1990 and 2000 this is accurately replicated by the sce r while other techniques apart from mcmc underestimated it furthermore the wavelet phases blue arrows are accurately captured by all techniques arrows pointing up down show a lead lag of 90 from the first time series to the second time series if the time series move together there is a zero phase difference if the arrows are pointing left right it means the time series are anti phase in phase i e negatively positively correlated in general the magnitude of the wavelet coefficient is accurately represented by all optimization techniques 4 6 implications for the kyb and the lake chad the kyb is a sub basin of the larger lake chad basin it represents 35 of the lake chad basin its rivers contribute significantly to the lake chad therefore the hydrology and ecosystem of the kyb particularly influence the drying or recovery of the lake chad over the past decades the kyb had witnessed episodes of drought and rainfall recovery thompson and polet 2000 adeyeri et al 2019b this had led to the modification of the hydrological regimes and systems since these systems are complex there is a need for an accurate representation of the basin s hydrological features on the representation of base flow this maintains the water quality river s biodiversity productivity and aquatic species migration by influencing the surface channel and the hyporheic zones malcolm et al 2004 thus an accurate representation of the baseflow is important for making relevant decisions for sustainable biodiversity management environmental policies river restoration as well as functional aquatic ecosystem preservation hitchman et al 2018 in the same vein the high flow could potentially maintain the food chain balance by reviving the wetlands in the basin adeyeri et al 2019a this will also replenish lake chad on the other hand excess water from continuous high flow spell could cause flooding consequently affecting properties farm produce and farmlands hence the water resource will be greatly stressed while the socio economic activity will be hampered according to cook et al 2015 the warming climate could aggravate the stress on freshwater resources hence to accurately manage the freshwater resources a proper representation of the hydrological system is essential especially in the face of changing climate 5 summary and conclusion different multi objective and multi optimization techniques have been evaluated in this study for the gr5j hydrological model applied to the case of the komadugu yobe basin kyb the calibration process involved the use of six evolutionary optimization methods sce r de pso mals loms and mcmc and three combined objective functions i e minimizing rmse maximizing both nse and kge the robustness of the calibration approaches was validated by considering two episodes 1974 2013 and 1980 2011 for the analysis the applied calibration methods showed reasonable abilities to simulate runoff with a satisfactory level of accuracy the results of the flow statistics were not universally consistent as some optimization methods overestimate while others continually underestimate the flow representation for example mcmc underestimated the maximum duration of high flow spell by 2 days while mals overestimated it by 13 days for the particular case of kyb we found that the de and the sce r methods performed best the multi objective computational assessment for each optimization methods to reach the optimal pareto solutions showed that mals exhibits the highest number of iterations while the pso had the highest number of simulations for both calibration periods the lowest iterations and simulations were exhibited by the sce r approach in all cases comparing the computational period and the performance metric of sce r indicates the trade off balance between computational period and simulation accuracy based on these evaluations it is concluded that the combination of multi objective functions and multi optimization techniques for optimal pareto sets for gr5j model parameters over the kyb do not only improve the stability of the model parameters during calibration but also improve the optimization ability of the calibration algorithms towards more accurate and robust representation of the river runoff in the basin furthermore the auto calibration method is more efficient as it circumvents the interference of anthropogenic factors as observed in manual calibrations madsen 2000 wu et al 2017 future work should incorporate more methodologies to ascertaining the different sources of uncertainty in model parameters model structure and input dataset as well as error structure and probabilities especially during calibration declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the

and a reduction in water storage opportunities due to either an increase in rainfall intensity or a decrease in rainfall frequency collins et al 2013 the increase in temperature is also likely to increase potential evaporation in some areas moratiel et al 2010 which implies a higher pressure on water resources therefore several management practices capable of supplying water demand without negatively impacting groundwater have been proposed and implemented rockström and falkenmark 2015 harb et al 2016 kim et al 2017 most of these carried out at regional scales involve the building of reservoirs and the development of farm dams and ring tanks at smaller scales poff and olden 2017 however these surface works also lead to significant water losses for instance in australia lost water in these structures can reach up to 40 of their storage capacity every year exceeding several thousand gl yr 1 which diminishes the water use efficiency and represents considerable economic losses craig et al 2005 among the alternative water harvesting methods managed aquifer recharge mar has gained importance it allows replenishing or maintaining groundwater levels in times of surface water surplus while providing a storage of water that can be used to sustain ecological functioning and irrigation needs during droughts rawluk et al 2013 without leading to higher water losses by evapotranspiration dillon and arshad 2016 this method balances and recovers groundwater resources by enhanced infiltration through in channel modifications floodwater spreading systems or injection wells and enables cyclical water management by storing surplus surface water in aquifers during wet years which can be pumped for use in dry years rawluk et al 2013 bouwer 2002 however some disadvantages of mar have also been reported this includes a limit on the recharge capacity depending on aquifer characteristics such as storage and transmission the high costs of implementation and operation especially using injection systems requiring high energy consumption and the potential of losses due to mixing when brackish aquifers are used dillon et al 2009 additionally before a mar project can be implemented studies are needed to assess its feasibility ringleb et al 2016 in particular the selection of suitable sites for the location of a project is not a trivial task because it requires the combination and prioritisation of different criteria the most common technique for the site suitability assessment is a multicriteria decision analysis mcda which can be easily combined with the use of geographical information systems qgis development team 2009 malczewski and riner 2016 the different techniques applied in the mcda seek to assign weights and combine different gis criteria based on the study goal sallwey et al 2018 several studies highlight the usefulness of mcda in context of data scarcity giove et al 2009 paquette and lowry 2012 paul et al 2016 rousseau et al 2017 while modeling algorithms and its performance depend on the quantity and quality of the datasets used mcda techniques integrate different data sources with the researchers judgement in the decision making process giove et al 2009 which has been proven effective in different fields gamper et al 2006 russo et al 2014 paul et al 2016 since the mcda requires the selection and assignment of weights of defined criteria some subjectivity is introduced in the decision making process buchanan et al 1998 among the different mdca alternatives the analytical hierarchy process ahp has been widely applied since it allows for a consistency check in the mcda which leads to a bias reduction in the analysis mu and pereyra rojas 2017 for that reason the use of ahp has increasingly been used in mar site suitability studies sallwey et al 2018 different new mcda techniques have been developed in the last decade rezaei 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 some of which have been proven better than ahp for particular cases kolios et al 2016 jozaghi et al 2018 while other studies demonstrate opposite results feizizadeh et al 2014 dožić and kalić 2015 thus in the end the goals of the different mcda projects determine the usefulness or performance of the methods used guarini et al 2018 in this regard ahp seems to perform well when dealing with simple problems asadabadi et al 2019 and much of the criticism concerning ahp has been caused by a misunderstanding of its functioning and applicability whitaker 2007 wang et al 2009 the main advantages of ahp over other techniques are its simplicity and its flexibility and intuitive appeal to users which makes it one of the most popular mcda techniques giove et al 2009 additionally a set of tools to perform ahp have been developed including online applications allowing work in multi user projects to obtain a consensus between participants goepel 2018 ahp has also proven useful compared to other approaches based on the criteria weighting process and for that reason has been coupled to other mcda techniques which have shown better results in the rating of alternatives mokhtar et al 2015 berdie et al 2017 given these reasons the simple criteria structure of site suitability for mar projects and the focus on mar site suitability which depends on the criteria weighting rather than on a selection of alternatives ahp was used in this particular study even though the magnitude of available water for a mar project can be integrated into the mcda this would generally lead to a loss of temporal information and therefore to a loss of the potential operation frequency accordingly we propose first to perform the site selection and later by refining the mar suitable areas an assessment of water availability the project was therefore split into two complementary steps based on the information sources used vectors rasters and time series in addition the location of areas for mar projects from site suitability maps have been vaguely defined where most studies finish with the creation of suitability maps ghayoumian et al 2007 chowdhury et al 2009 mahmoud 2014 also different alternatives for validation have been proposed some of them limited to the consistency of the mcda technique applied kazakis 2018 in this study we propose to refine the area of interest aoi for mar projects by coupling the site suitability and sensitivity analysis thus areas with high suitability and low sensitivity in relation to the different scenarios may be selected for validation the evaluation of local natural recharge is proposed as an additional technique to evaluate the suitability results therefore the main objectives of this study are to develop a site suitability map and to define a potential aoi for mar projects in an example catchment in australia using a mcda based on an ahp technique coupling the results of the suitability and the sensitivity analysis and validating the defined aoi through hydrograph analysis additionally estimates of water volumes available for recharge and their corresponding frequencies were also assessed in a subsequent complementary step 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in the namoi catchment located in new south wales nsw australia which covers an area of approximately 42 000 km2 fig 1 this catchment was selected due to the high level of agricultural and irrigation development a significant area in the catchment is used for agriculture with cotton being the most important irrigated crop it is suggested that water withdrawals for irrigation have changed gaining sections of the namoi river into losing sections kelly et al 2013 groundwater abstractions have also led to a decrease in groundwater levels in areas away from the river which have dropped up to 30 m between 1978 and 2008 kelly et al 2014 this offers the opportunity to study the feasibility of mar projects to reduce groundwater decline and potentially increase water resources for irrigation as well as providing environmental services the catchment is characterised by a wide floodplain in the west and highland areas in the east and south the mean annual rainfall in the catchment is 800 mm ranging from less than 500 mm to the west of the catchment to over 1000 mm eastward while potential evapotranspiration averages 1300 mm y 1 mccallum et al 2010 the surface has been carved out by the namoi river and its tributaries which have developed a continuous setting of cainozoic fluvial and alluvial sediments to the east of the catchment hydrogeologic units develop in paleozoic fractured rocks fig 2 the fluvial filling sediments have been traditionally divided into three main formations that have been characterised as different aquifer units with spatially variable interconnectivity williams et al 1969 kelly et al 2013 of which the uppermost formation is referred to as the narrabri formation this formation dates from the pleistocene has a general thickness of 30 40 m ranging from 10 to 70 m and consists mainly of clay dominated sediments with minor channels of sand and gravel within it an unconfined aquifer can be found which is connected with the namoi river in some reaches kelly et al 2014 the shallow aquifer in the region according to this conceptual model is one of the main recharge sources to the underlying highly productive aquifers corresponding to the gunnedah and the cubbaroo formations mainly conformed by sand and gravel sediments however this traditional conceptualization of the alluvial aquifer has been contested in different studies kelly et al 2014 acworth et al 2015 kelly et al 2017 because it fails to explain the hydrogeochemical results obtained in the catchment these studies have found the alluvial aquifer being a distributive fluvial system with different degrees of interconnectivity based on the sediment composition which is recharged by floodwaters and river leakage but also by the great artesian basin gab in different areas iverach et al 2017 another dominant feature in the catchment is the presence of an upper clay layer of approximately 10 m thickness characterised by low hydraulic connectivity which can be found across almost all the alluvial deposits timms et al 2011 this must be considered when studying the surface groundwater interaction in the catchment and the potential for the development of a mar project using surface spreading methods which requires a high infiltration capacity of the sediments 2 2 data and preprocessing steps data sets used in this study are the australian smoothed digital elevation model dem s gallant et al 2011 the australian groundwater explorer the australian hydrological geospatial fabric v 2 1 geofabric the australian land use and management alum for nsw the atlas of australian soils and the water nsw gauging stations a slope raster was obtained at a 30 m resolution from the dem s dataset drainage paths and major river channels were selected from the geofabric product to generate drainage density and distance to river maps for all grid points in the catchment surface hydrogeological units and aquifer hydraulic conductivity yield and salinity maps were directly obtained from the geofabric groundwater dataset bureau of meteorology 2012 a raster of groundwater levels was obtained from the monitoring bores included in the groundwater explorer http www bom gov au water groundwater by averaging the groundwater levels filtering out bores with mean groundwater levels greater than 35 m depth and with less than 10 observations in time and interpolating kriging the level of the remaining bores a map of soil hydraulic conductivity classes was obtained from the australian soil atlas http www asris csiro au themes atlas html a map of distances to agricultural areas distance to users was generated from the alum land use maps abares 2016 additionally daily gauging station data from the water nsw website https realtimedata waternsw com au and rainfall time series data from the silo website https legacy longpaddock qld gov au silo were also used all criteria maps were rasterized converted to the same coordinate system gcs wgs84 and clipped to the extension of the namoi basin 2 3 map reclassification and rating since mcda requires all data to be standardised and converted to the same schema sallwey et al 2018 all maps were reclassified and ranked as shown in table 1 based on a review of commonly used classes the data distribution and parameter ranges in this study in channel modifications and spreading methods were originally considered as potential techniques for the mar project therefore the criteria were selected and treated accordingly sites with low slopes have less runoff and are more suitable to promote infiltration therefore lower slopes were ranked higher since floods are considered as the source of water for the project and their occurrence takes place in the neighborhood of streams a closer distance to rivers is indicative of higher suitability however very small distances were also penalized ranked third in order to avoid the flow from the recharge project back to the stream from a water table mound caused by the project sophocleous 2002 long distances from the river were ranked lower because they imply higher costs for the project due to the need for hydraulic infrastructure to transport the water drainage density evaluated as the ratio between the length of the drainage path and the area that it covers km km 2 has been inversely related to the permeability because a denser underlying lithology causes higher runoff which leads to the development of a well defined drainage network ghayoumian et al 2007 raviraj et al 2017 thus drainage density was inversely ranked in equally separated classes hydrogeologic units were reclassified and ranked such that a range of different lithologies from the alluvial channel and floodplain sediments to intrusive igneous very strong sedimentary and metamorphic lithologies could be observed these were classified as having very high alluvial sediments to very low suitability hard rocks for the mar location aquifer hydraulic conductivity ks and yield were reclassified and ranked favouring higher conductivity and recovery yield rates aquifer salinities were classified and ranked based on a salinity classification for irrigation water developed by the victorian government http agriculture vic gov au groundwater depths were ranked using two criteria on the one hand very shallow depths constrain the potential for the project because the recharge in those areas can lead to groundwater discharge and water logging kazakis 2018 in addition some interaction between soil and sediment particles with the infiltrating solution which partly depends on the vadose zone depth is required to reduce the potential harm of groundwater pollution rahman et al 2012 on the other hand elevated groundwater depths based on darcy s law imply longer times for water transport and a higher residence time of ponded water which increases evaporation losses therefore intermediate depths were ranked higher in this study higher soil ks was ranked higher because as it was pointed out by arshad et al 2014 infiltration rates are one of the key properties of the physical medium that influences the economic feasibility of a mar project in a catchment since the purpose of the project is to increase the available groundwater for irrigation purposes smaller distances to irrigation fields distance to users were ranked higher 2 4 decision criteria and site suitability map the site suitability map to locate a project was based on a multi criteria decision analysis mcda using analytic hierarchy process ahp and pairwise comparisons the ahp technique is one of the most commonly used mcda tools which applies an eigenvalue approach to the pairwise comparisons vaidya and kumar 2006 reducing the subjectivity associated with the definition of weights kazakis 2018 the pairwise comparisons were carried out using the saaty s pairwise comparison scale between criteria pairs saaty 2012 which were treated independently the scale ranges between 1 where both criteria are equally important and 9 where one criterium is far more important than the other different pairwise comparisons were carried out to obtain a consolidated decision matrix through the geometric mean of individual matrices according to eq 1 1 c i j e x p 1 n k 1 n l n a i j k where cij is the consolidated decision matrix being i and j the rows and columns of the matrices k is each participant n the total number of participants and aij k corresponds to the decision matrix of each participant the ahp technique was evaluated through a consistency ratio cr which corresponds to the ratio between the consistency index of the pairwise comparison matrix ci and the consistency index of a random like matrix known as random index ri where values smaller than 0 1 are considered acceptable to continue the decision making analysis mu and pereyra rojas 2017 the consistency index is estimated by eq 2 2 c i λ m a x n n 1 where n is the number of compared elements n number of criteria and λmax is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix all ahp analysis was carried out using the online ahp os software https bpmsg com ahp online system goepel 2018 a sensitivity analysis was also carried out using 7 alternative weighting schemes table 2 for the criteria groups defined in table 1 mainly to find areas relatively insensitive to the weighting schemas in the first six scenarios the weights were alternately applied to the weightings obtained from the ahp technique such that one group was excluded from the analysis and the others split the weights into one and two thirds in the last scheme all criteria were equally weighted the final map of site suitability was obtained using eq 3 3 s i i 1 n w i r i where si stands for suitability index ranging from 0 to 5 being 5 the most suitable locations w and r correspond to the weights and rating of each criterion i respectively the site suitability map was subsequently reclassified into 6 classes which accounts for extremely low very low low moderate high and very high suitabilities the different schemas from the sensitivity analysis were also used to create suitability maps in order to compare the different criteria weighting the pre processing reclassification and rating of all criteria layers and the obtaining of the suitability maps were done using the qgis software qgis development team 2009 2 5 area of interest aoi and validation the selection of an aoi was carried out based on the areas that indicated a high and very high suitability in the map generated additionally low sensitivity to the weighting schemes was also considered for the selection of the aoi the validation of the area selected was based on an assessment of the natural recharge in the aoi in order to evaluate the natural recharge the master recession curve mrc was calculated for different monitoring wells contained in the australian groundwater explorer dataset from the hydrograph data bores related to the uppermost aquifer were selected additionally bores whose hydrographs indicated a strong intraseasonal fluctuation were neglected since it was assumed that those were caused by the pumping of irrigation water in the area or a high connection to lower aquifers that are used for extraction from the mrc the water table fluctuation method was used to derive recharge from the different hydrographs through eq 4 assuming a limited connection between the different aquifers in the aoi 4 r δ h δ t s y where r is recharge in a specific time interval t δh is the change in groundwater height and sy corresponds to the specific yield of the aquifer scanlon and healy 2002 since the namoi river plays an important role in the hydrological and hydrogeological response of the catchment especially in the alluvial aquifers recharge was assumed to be a response to rainfall a losing river system and floods taking place episodically in the floodplain adjacent to the main stream channel lamontagne et al 2015 studying the groundwater geochemistry in the catchment described two groundwater systems in the alluvial sediments a shallow one that contains mostly water infiltrated from the river and a deeper one that contains a mixture of young river recharge and old groundwater gab additionally iverach et al 2017 found the gab recharge into the alluvial aquifer system as being spatially variable since this study concentrates in the shallow aquifer in an aoi defined and since the gab discharge into the namoi alluvium was not distinguishable at most water level monitoring locations and in particular in the smaller focus area west of mollee weir to the west of narrabri this input was not taken into account even though the specific yield is a property that changes spatially in the aquifers depending on the composition of the sediments its estimation is difficult therefore a constant value of 0 05 was used in this study based on schlumberger water services australia reported value schlumberger water services australia 2012 however specific yield values between 0 01 and 0 1 are also expected in the alluvial aquifer higher values may be found in the main trunk channel associated with a higher composition of sand and gravel particles while adjacent areas of the floodplain where the composition of clay and silt particles increases lead to lower specific yield values 2 6 water availability the available water for the mar project was calculated constrained to the aoi it was calculated considering floods as the main source of water for the project from the set of hydrological stations in the catchment a gauge located in highly suitable areas was selected its rating curve was evaluated taking the inflection of the curve as the discharge point at which the stream breaks out of the channel and spreads to the adjacent floodplain a flood frequency curve was also carried out to evaluate the periodicity of such events and to quantify the available water that might be used for recharge purposes kuczera and franks 2016 a schema of the methodology is presented in fig 3 3 results 3 1 criteria maps the criteria maps are shown in fig 4 most of the maps are governed by the geomorphology of the catchment the slope gradient is one of the main factors creating the landscape and is associated with some hydrogeologic properties in this case slope hydrogeologic units and groundwater ks indicate similar patterns as it can be seen the most prohibitive criteria based on the area covered by very low suitability ranks are those that relate to the distance to rivers and users and also the aquifer yield which is mainly constrained by the alluvial deposits in the basin this is in contrast to the slope map which shows that most areas in the catchment have low slopes favorable for mar projects overall these maps highlight the importance of stream channels in the catchment development these carved in the overlying lithologies due to slope gradients build up erosional and depositional environments which finally lead to the generation of alluvial aquifers and soils at these locations surrounding the river channels most irrigated agriculture takes places 3 2 ahp analysis the comparisons between the different criteria layers generate a consolidated decision matrix which can be found in table a1 appendix section since the pairwise comparison matrix led to a consistency ratio cr of 0 013 it was assumed as consistent and we continued with further stages of the decision making process subsequently the decision hierarchy for the evaluated criteria was calculated table 3 as it can be seen slope aquifer salinity and hydrogeologic unit were ranked as the three most important criteria used several studies ghayoumian et al 2007 rahman et al 2012 valverde et al 2016 combine a boolean logic with mcda resulting in a first stage in which slope is selected as a criterium to mask suitability areas this demonstrates the importance of this criterium especially for surface spreading and in channel modification mar methodologies additionally we gave a high importance to the groundwater quality aquifer salinity since it would preclude the groundwater use for irrigation purposes which would make the mar project useless the hydrogeologic unit is also highly important since it depicts the medium where the infiltrated water is intended to be stored on the contrary the soil ks and the aquifer ks and yield were considered to have lower importance since these reduce the mar potential for groundwater recharge but would not make it non viable from the beginning such as the highly ranked criteria 3 3 site suitability and sensitivity analysis the suitability map obtained from the ahp is presented in fig 5 highly suitable areas for the location of the project are mainly observed close to the stream channels in the alluvial sediments the sensitivity analysis gave similar results in terms of site suitability maps using the different weighting schemes from table 2 except for the schemes 4 and 6 fig 6 which share a higher relative weighting 0 66 for the underground criteria including soil ks and groundwater depth therefore the weighting schemes prioritising surface or aquifer criteria change the site suitability map results to a lesser extent this constrains the suitable and highly suitable areas mostly to the alluvial deposits and whose highly suitable areas can be found in middle sections of the catchment an assessment of the areas covered by the different suitability classes is presented in table 4 for the sensitivity analysis scheme 3 which assigns a higher relative weighting to the aquifer properties has the evenest distribution between classes lower standard deviation while scheme 7 which uses an even weighting for all criteria is the most conservative approach for the site suitability map generation with a high deviation and the highest kurtosis the scheme resulting from the ahp indicates a high deviation between classes being mostly concentrated between areas of low and moderate suitability 3 4 aoi selection and assessment of suitability based on the locations that indicate high and very high suitability using the ahp and with highest agreement across the eight maps of the sensitivity analysis presented a low sensitivity to the weighting schemas used an area of interest aoi between narrabri and wee waa municipalities was drawn for the location of a mar project from this aoi a gauging station with more than 30 years of daily records was selected fig 7 the selection of the aoi also corresponds to an area where cotton irrigation agriculture is highly developed which spreads to the west of the catchment in addition the overall groundwater gradient of the shallow aquifer follows the slope of the terrain and the stream flow direction heading toward the west mccallum et al 2009 several farm dams can be observed in the aoi which store water for irrigation purposes several monitoring wells 20 are located in the aoi which present different hydrographic behaviour wells located near the namoi river in the surrounding paleochannels abandoned stream channels wray 2009 welsh et al 2014 show rapid peaks of groundwater level increase in the hydrograph which tend to smoothen in wells located farther away fig 8 these peaks correspond to recharge events kelly et al 2013 and are followed by clear recession behaviour additionally the aoi selected and all associated monitoring wells are located in areas that according to iverach et al 2017 lack of a gab contribution to recharge or where this is small and therefore the water fluctuation methodology used for recharge estimation was assumed correct since recharge is a response to natural processes rainfall streamflow it showed to be highly variable in time fig 9 additionally recharge estimates were also spatially variable fig 10 following the trend in the hydrographs high recharge values were estimated in monitoring wells located in the paleochannel surrounding the namoi river mean recharge estimates range from around 100 to over 700 mm y 1 the highest recharge corresponds to a monitoring well located in the western area of the aoi close to the namoi river where floods tend to inundate the surrounding area when compared to mean annual rainfall values obtained from the silo rainfall dataset annual recharge estimates in the different monitoring bores range from 2 3 to 21 4 of accumulated rainfall not shown with the lower percentages located in the eastern part of the aoi since a high spatial variability may be observed in the relatively small area that comprises the aoi recharge estimates obtained from the water fluctuation method must be interpreted as a local property instead of a regional value delin et al 2007 being highly affected by the underground sediments which are locally variable especially in the alluvium in the vicinity of the main stream channel kelly et al 2014 a correlation between recharge estimates and rainfall was carried out fig 11 left in addition a correlation between mean annual discharge from the selected gauging station and the annual recharge estimates for each bore was also carried out fig 11 right in general the mean annual river discharge leads to higher correlations with annual recharge estimates than the disaggregated rainfall the correlations between discharge and recharge are mostly in the 0 7 0 8 interval which implies a strong very strong relationship between variables in contrast correlation coefficients between rainfall and recharge estimates are mainly in the 0 4 0 7 interval indicating a moderate strong relationship between variables the high recharge estimates in the aoi which are higher in the vicinity of the namoi river indicate locations where the natural recharge can be used for a mar project since recharge events in the study area are strongly dependent on the streamflow spreading methods can be implemented in the palaeochannel surrounding the namoi river but also in channel modifications can be developed to increase the recharge from the namoi river 3 5 water availability from gauging data the hydrograph analysis of the selected gauging station is in fig 12 it presents the rating and flood frequency curves of the namoi river at mollee additionally a logarithmic regression was fitted to the flood frequency data dashed line from the hydrograph analysis a discharge value of approximately 500 m3 s 1 leads to an inflection in the rating curve which was assumed to be the discharge that leads to a flow that exceeds the channel storage capacity and therefore leads to floods over the surrounding floodplain then assuming that the mar project will capture at least one flood event within a return period of 5 years to replenish the groundwater storage this would correspond to a daily mean discharge of 883 m3 s 1 subtracting the discharge threshold obtained from the rating curve to this discharge at a 5 years return period leads to 383 m3 s 1 exceeding the stream channel capacity and causing flooding in the surrounding areas which implies a volume of over 33 g l per day that might be allocated for recharge purposes this volume constitutes around 8 of the keepit dam capacity the major dam in the catchment however return period were estimated using the annual maximum series while actually flood waves might take several days in traveling and receding fuentes et al 2019 this implies that floods usually take longer than a single day and therefore greater available water volumes for recharge are expected from such events for instance the flood occurred in november 2011 in the molle gauging station took around six days in receding with discharges over 800 m3 s 1 5 consecutive days over 1000 m3 s 1 which implied a volume of over 240 g l exceeding the channel more than half the storage capacity of the keepit dam which might be used to enhance recharge 4 discussion there are many studies coupling mcda and gis to evaluate the site suitability for mar projects rahman et al 2012 russo et al 2014 kazakis 2018 sallwey et al 2018 however several lack sensitivity analysis or validation of results ghayoumian et al 2007 chowdhury et al 2009 rahman et al 2012 owusu et al 2017 in this study the sensitivity analysis not only showed the effect of changing the criteria weights on the site suitability but it also allowed the selection of suitable areas which were less sensitive to the weighting decision in this study the weight assigned to the permeability of the soils criterium was ranked the lowest in opposition to arshad et al 2014 this is explained by the fact that the current study assessed mainly the physical suitability of mar projects rather than its economic feasibility since the permeability of the soil interface can be either enhanced or bypassed by using different artificial recharge techniques bouwer 2002 it becomes less significant than other criteria from a physical perspective validation is one of the most variable aspects in site suitability for mar projects for instance saidi et al 2017 suggest that there is no direct method to verify mar suitable sites and therefore indirect methods must be applied some studies ghayoumian et al 2007 mahmoud 2014 have used the presence of ongoing mar projects to validate their results kazakis 2018 assumed the consistency of the ahp technique and a subsequent sensitivity analysis to be enough for validation while russo et al 2014 used a numerical model to validate their results in the present study the natural recharge estimated through the water table fluctuation method in different monitoring wells was used to validate the aoi delineated since the preferred methods of recharge imply either spreading alternatives or in channel modifications one of the difficulties of estimating recharge is its spatio temporal variability which is frequently neglected manna et al 2019 it is also difficult to get recharge estimates due to the limitations of the different methodologies available for its quantification knowing this difficulty scanlon et al 2002 proposed the use of combined alternatives for a recharge estimation which makes the estimation harder there are several advantages and disadvantages in relation to the water table fluctuation methodology while it allows an estimate of groundwater recharge in time it depends on other properties such as the specific yield healy and cook 2002 which was assumed constant in this study additionally the connectivity between aquifers was neglected based on the hydrograph behavior however lamontagne et al 2015 and iverach et al 2017 studies present enough evidence to validate this approach used the temporal frequency of the recorded water levels tended to vary in the dataset during some of the time intervals sampling happened at low frequency such as quarterly which might affect the recharge estimates nevertheless since the hydrograph data is publicly available and has long time series it constitutes a valuable data source for local recharge estimations different studies have estimated recharge in the namoi catchment with quite variable results depending on the methodologies and study locations crosbie et al 2010 identified a recharge of 58 mm y 1 in the lower namoi area using the water table fluctuation mccallum et al 2010 by using the waves model estimated 14 mm y 1 of recharge but this was only valid for the specific date and location studied and assuming recharge was equivalent to drainage below 4 m depth abbs and littleboy 1998 used the perfect cropping model to evaluate recharge in the liverpool plains upper namoi catchment and estimated between 28 and 80 mm y 1 in agricultural black earth soils weaver et al 2013 using a chloride mass balance found deep drainage estimates from a few mm to around 400 mm between the 2010 2011 cotton growing season at three sites around namoi wee waa and merah north all located in the lower namoi cuthbert et al 2016 by studying an ephemeral stream tributary of maules creek in the upper namoi estimated from 30 to 80 mm y 1 of indirect recharge by using the water table fluctuation method timms et al 2012 studying two sites located in floodplains of the lower namoi modelled deep drainage using apsim and estimated drainage values between 3 3 and 9 5 mm y 1 all these studies prove that groundwater recharge in a catchment is spatially variable coincidentally in the selected aoi kelly et al 2009 evaluated the namoi river between the mollee close to narrabri and the gunidgera near wee waa weirs using continuous electrical imaging for mapping recharge and found potential recharge pathways in this reach of the namoi river the same study describes that the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers increases to the west beyond the aoi selected in this study and that in the range of longitudes that coincide with the current aoi is where most of the recharge occurs due to the presence of sand and gravels in the upper 10 m of sediments underlying the river which is also supported by some cross sectional profiles in lamontagne et al 2015 fig 13 these characteristics help to explain the variability and the high recharge estimates in the aoi which are also reported in williams et al 1969 for the gunidgera and mollee weir locations lamontagne et al 2015 studying the river infiltration in a reach of the namoi river between the molle and yarral weirs both included in the aoi found that the river behaved as a losing system most of the time except during floods in which the river led to bank recharge discharge cycles using hydrogeochemical analysis the study estimated infiltration rates ranging from 0 6 to 5 m y 1 iverach et al 2017 studying the groundwater mixing process in the lower namoi alluvium also found significant recharge during floods especially in monitoring wells near the river which present a high connectivity with the surface this study estimated high recharge values which are nevertheless within the range of recharge values found in the aforementioned literature these estimates are justified based on the locations where they were obtained which correspond to the surroundings of the namoi river in relatively high conductive sediments therefore these values may be used as a way to validate the results of the suitability map a previous study of the potential for a mar project in the catchment was carried out by woolley et al 1994 this identified potential sites for a mar trial located in some abandoned gravel pits near merah north in the lower namoi catchment the recharge in the area is described as small except when overbank flooding occurs the study also suggested potential trial sites in doreen lane located 9 km to the north of merah north but without specifying how to transport the water for the trial project two other sites were defined in the upper namoi catchment close to quirindi through the use of a weir and in the watermark area most of the areas mentioned were classified as having high suitabilities in the current study but were not as insensitive as the aoi selected woolley et al 1994 also estimated a monthly availability of 30 g l of water for a mar project however their study suggests to take such estimate with extreme caution and that it would coincide with floods since weirs increase the opportunity for river infiltration and the hydraulic head it is clear that these present a high potential for inducing recharge in the river kelly et al 2013 especially if these are located in highly conductive reaches hydrograph data gives clue of such unintentional benefit in the mollee weir however induced recharge estimates in this location have not been carried out these structures might be one of the ways to conceive the development of a mar project in the catchment taking advantage of the high conductivity of underlying sediments nevertheless groundwater monitoring bores are still too sparse and spaced to identify the higher conductive locations in the paleochannels surrounding the namoi river therefore a higher spatial resolution to find optimal recharge locations by geophysical surveys and detailed lithological coring in the region is still required for the emplacement of a mar project that may operate under spreading or in channel modification techniques there are several studies that discuss the role of floods in groundwater recharge doble et al 2013 in another australian catchment found that floods contributed a 4 of the total recharge being 17 of the riparian recharge kelly et al 2013 discussed the peaks in namoi groundwater hydrographs as depicting flood recharge regarding the river system brownbill et al 2011 described the studied reach of the namoi river as a connected losing system which is recharging groundwater since during floods the water levels in the stream channels also rise these lead to a higher hydraulic gradient which implies higher recharge also explaining the dependence of recharge on the river discharge although available water estimates from floods can be calculated that does not necessarily mean that such volumes can be used for irrigation regulations and entitlements are strong constraints on the potential use of available water even in surplus periods such as during floods since mar has got a relatively slow acceptance dillon et al 2018 regulations regarding its applicability are still a limiting factor however increased recharge into the groundwater can have additional benefits in relation to overall groundwater sustainability several mar projects that use spreading or in channel modification systems are in operation however these are considerably less popular than bank filtration sprenger et al 2017 which is mainly used as a water treatment system maeng 2010 spreading methods to enhance recharge have historically been used and are currently the second most common technique to implement mar in europe with 77 active sites in 2013 sprenger et al 2017 however such projects have also been implemented successfully in other continents for instance the development of pilot projects for mar under spreading methods has been implemented since the 1960 s in arizona united states dillon et al 2018 and are envisaged in the present as important ways to recharge depleted aquifers in the central valley of california by on farm recharge flooding kocis and dahlke 2017 in japan a spreading basin operating since 2009 in alluvial fans has been reported as contributing to the sustainable management of the local aquifer hida 2009 regarding in channel modification projects sprenger et al 2017 only mention one active project in europe while dillon et al 2018 describes that it has been applied extensively in india but also in china even though the site suitability map generated indicates potential areas for a mar project implementation and even though a validation of one of the potential sites was carried out the numerical modeling of different artificial recharge alternatives should be carried out to assess the impact of such project on the surroundings additionally no water quality assessment has been considered in this study which is also required before the implementation of a pilot project therefore further studies addressing these issues and analysing other mcda alternatives and their corresponding uncertainties will be matter for future investigations finally the modeling of the groundwater response to the mar project located in the selected aoi might also be a subject for future research 5 conclusions the combined use of mcda and gis is a valuable tool for the selection of suitable sites for mar projects these can allow a consistency analysis and represent useful alternatives that can shed light on territorial planning through the use of publicly available data in low local data environments this resulted finally in the generation of a site suitability map additionally sensitivity analysis allows an assessment of criteria weighting and the selection of aois to locate potential mar projects at a catchment scale however the selected mcda does not allow for a quantification of the uncertainties in the weighting process and strongly relies on the user s judgment to prioritise different criteria having restricted applicability for more automatised tasks the validation process used estimates the natural groundwater recharge to highlight its spatial variability but also showed that natural recharge was strongly dependent on the river streamflow patterns this analysis also confirms how floods and streamflow are a significant source of recharge in the catchment moreover recharge estimates in the selected aoi are high yet higher estimates can be associated to the paleochannel surrounding the namoi river among the different techniques for mar projects weirs might be built in conductive reaches of the stream network to enhance groundwater recharge this study provides potential locations and spatio temporal estimates of locally available water for mar which might be derived from floods by using spread or in channel modification methods however the practical use of this water for mar and irrigation would be limited by local regulations and water entitlements even though this study finds potential sites for a mar project geophysical surveys or detailed lithological coring might further constrain the selection of optimal sites based on the conductive properties of the sediments author contributions original idea i f data preprocessing and coding i f supervision r w v draft writing i f draft edition r w v funding this

8391,study region this study was conducted in the namoi catchment australia study focus managed aquifer recharge mar site suitability has been widely studied through multicriteria decision analysis mcda however the selection of areas for mar project implementation can be a vague process with different validation approaches the aim of this study was to create a site suitability map for mar projects and conduct a sensitivity analysis for the selection of an area of interest aoi by combining highly suitable and low sensitive areas ten hydrologic and hydrogeologic criteria were chosen for the selection of sites for the mar project all criteria were reclassified and used in a mcda that combined analytic hierarchy processes ahp and pairwise comparisons to construct a site suitability map validation of the map and the aoi selected was performed using hydrograph data based on the aoi map water availability and frequency were analysed using gauging station data new hydrological insights for the region the selected aoi represents high spatio temporal variability in natural recharge rates highly dependent on the namoi river streamflow moreover all recharge rates in the aoi are high particularly in the paleochannel surrounding the current namoi river the selected aoi coincides with an area of thick coarse sediments underlying the riverbed and demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed methodology keywords managed aquifer recharge mcda site suitability water availability groundwater recharge 1 introduction several studies have highlighted the depletion of global groundwater resources due to unsustainable exploitation rates gleeson et al 2012 rodell et al 2009 döll et al 2014 moreover many countries are now clearly affected by climate change with increasing temperatures and a reduction in water storage opportunities due to either an increase in rainfall intensity or a decrease in rainfall frequency collins et al 2013 the increase in temperature is also likely to increase potential evaporation in some areas moratiel et al 2010 which implies a higher pressure on water resources therefore several management practices capable of supplying water demand without negatively impacting groundwater have been proposed and implemented rockström and falkenmark 2015 harb et al 2016 kim et al 2017 most of these carried out at regional scales involve the building of reservoirs and the development of farm dams and ring tanks at smaller scales poff and olden 2017 however these surface works also lead to significant water losses for instance in australia lost water in these structures can reach up to 40 of their storage capacity every year exceeding several thousand gl yr 1 which diminishes the water use efficiency and represents considerable economic losses craig et al 2005 among the alternative water harvesting methods managed aquifer recharge mar has gained importance it allows replenishing or maintaining groundwater levels in times of surface water surplus while providing a storage of water that can be used to sustain ecological functioning and irrigation needs during droughts rawluk et al 2013 without leading to higher water losses by evapotranspiration dillon and arshad 2016 this method balances and recovers groundwater resources by enhanced infiltration through in channel modifications floodwater spreading systems or injection wells and enables cyclical water management by storing surplus surface water in aquifers during wet years which can be pumped for use in dry years rawluk et al 2013 bouwer 2002 however some disadvantages of mar have also been reported this includes a limit on the recharge capacity depending on aquifer characteristics such as storage and transmission the high costs of implementation and operation especially using injection systems requiring high energy consumption and the potential of losses due to mixing when brackish aquifers are used dillon et al 2009 additionally before a mar project can be implemented studies are needed to assess its feasibility ringleb et al 2016 in particular the selection of suitable sites for the location of a project is not a trivial task because it requires the combination and prioritisation of different criteria the most common technique for the site suitability assessment is a multicriteria decision analysis mcda which can be easily combined with the use of geographical information systems qgis development team 2009 malczewski and riner 2016 the different techniques applied in the mcda seek to assign weights and combine different gis criteria based on the study goal sallwey et al 2018 several studies highlight the usefulness of mcda in context of data scarcity giove et al 2009 paquette and lowry 2012 paul et al 2016 rousseau et al 2017 while modeling algorithms and its performance depend on the quantity and quality of the datasets used mcda techniques integrate different data sources with the researchers judgement in the decision making process giove et al 2009 which has been proven effective in different fields gamper et al 2006 russo et al 2014 paul et al 2016 since the mcda requires the selection and assignment of weights of defined criteria some subjectivity is introduced in the decision making process buchanan et al 1998 among the different mdca alternatives the analytical hierarchy process ahp has been widely applied since it allows for a consistency check in the mcda which leads to a bias reduction in the analysis mu and pereyra rojas 2017 for that reason the use of ahp has increasingly been used in mar site suitability studies sallwey et al 2018 different new mcda techniques have been developed in the last decade rezaei 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 some of which have been proven better than ahp for particular cases kolios et al 2016 jozaghi et al 2018 while other studies demonstrate opposite results feizizadeh et al 2014 dožić and kalić 2015 thus in the end the goals of the different mcda projects determine the usefulness or performance of the methods used guarini et al 2018 in this regard ahp seems to perform well when dealing with simple problems asadabadi et al 2019 and much of the criticism concerning ahp has been caused by a misunderstanding of its functioning and applicability whitaker 2007 wang et al 2009 the main advantages of ahp over other techniques are its simplicity and its flexibility and intuitive appeal to users which makes it one of the most popular mcda techniques giove et al 2009 additionally a set of tools to perform ahp have been developed including online applications allowing work in multi user projects to obtain a consensus between participants goepel 2018 ahp has also proven useful compared to other approaches based on the criteria weighting process and for that reason has been coupled to other mcda techniques which have shown better results in the rating of alternatives mokhtar et al 2015 berdie et al 2017 given these reasons the simple criteria structure of site suitability for mar projects and the focus on mar site suitability which depends on the criteria weighting rather than on a selection of alternatives ahp was used in this particular study even though the magnitude of available water for a mar project can be integrated into the mcda this would generally lead to a loss of temporal information and therefore to a loss of the potential operation frequency accordingly we propose first to perform the site selection and later by refining the mar suitable areas an assessment of water availability the project was therefore split into two complementary steps based on the information sources used vectors rasters and time series in addition the location of areas for mar projects from site suitability maps have been vaguely defined where most studies finish with the creation of suitability maps ghayoumian et al 2007 chowdhury et al 2009 mahmoud 2014 also different alternatives for validation have been proposed some of them limited to the consistency of the mcda technique applied kazakis 2018 in this study we propose to refine the area of interest aoi for mar projects by coupling the site suitability and sensitivity analysis thus areas with high suitability and low sensitivity in relation to the different scenarios may be selected for validation the evaluation of local natural recharge is proposed as an additional technique to evaluate the suitability results therefore the main objectives of this study are to develop a site suitability map and to define a potential aoi for mar projects in an example catchment in australia using a mcda based on an ahp technique coupling the results of the suitability and the sensitivity analysis and validating the defined aoi through hydrograph analysis additionally estimates of water volumes available for recharge and their corresponding frequencies were also assessed in a subsequent complementary step 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in the namoi catchment located in new south wales nsw australia which covers an area of approximately 42 000 km2 fig 1 this catchment was selected due to the high level of agricultural and irrigation development a significant area in the catchment is used for agriculture with cotton being the most important irrigated crop it is suggested that water withdrawals for irrigation have changed gaining sections of the namoi river into losing sections kelly et al 2013 groundwater abstractions have also led to a decrease in groundwater levels in areas away from the river which have dropped up to 30 m between 1978 and 2008 kelly et al 2014 this offers the opportunity to study the feasibility of mar projects to reduce groundwater decline and potentially increase water resources for irrigation as well as providing environmental services the catchment is characterised by a wide floodplain in the west and highland areas in the east and south the mean annual rainfall in the catchment is 800 mm ranging from less than 500 mm to the west of the catchment to over 1000 mm eastward while potential evapotranspiration averages 1300 mm y 1 mccallum et al 2010 the surface has been carved out by the namoi river and its tributaries which have developed a continuous setting of cainozoic fluvial and alluvial sediments to the east of the catchment hydrogeologic units develop in paleozoic fractured rocks fig 2 the fluvial filling sediments have been traditionally divided into three main formations that have been characterised as different aquifer units with spatially variable interconnectivity williams et al 1969 kelly et al 2013 of which the uppermost formation is referred to as the narrabri formation this formation dates from the pleistocene has a general thickness of 30 40 m ranging from 10 to 70 m and consists mainly of clay dominated sediments with minor channels of sand and gravel within it an unconfined aquifer can be found which is connected with the namoi river in some reaches kelly et al 2014 the shallow aquifer in the region according to this conceptual model is one of the main recharge sources to the underlying highly productive aquifers corresponding to the gunnedah and the cubbaroo formations mainly conformed by sand and gravel sediments however this traditional conceptualization of the alluvial aquifer has been contested in different studies kelly et al 2014 acworth et al 2015 kelly et al 2017 because it fails to explain the hydrogeochemical results obtained in the catchment these studies have found the alluvial aquifer being a distributive fluvial system with different degrees of interconnectivity based on the sediment composition which is recharged by floodwaters and river leakage but also by the great artesian basin gab in different areas iverach et al 2017 another dominant feature in the catchment is the presence of an upper clay layer of approximately 10 m thickness characterised by low hydraulic connectivity which can be found across almost all the alluvial deposits timms et al 2011 this must be considered when studying the surface groundwater interaction in the catchment and the potential for the development of a mar project using surface spreading methods which requires a high infiltration capacity of the sediments 2 2 data and preprocessing steps data sets used in this study are the australian smoothed digital elevation model dem s gallant et al 2011 the australian groundwater explorer the australian hydrological geospatial fabric v 2 1 geofabric the australian land use and management alum for nsw the atlas of australian soils and the water nsw gauging stations a slope raster was obtained at a 30 m resolution from the dem s dataset drainage paths and major river channels were selected from the geofabric product to generate drainage density and distance to river maps for all grid points in the catchment surface hydrogeological units and aquifer hydraulic conductivity yield and salinity maps were directly obtained from the geofabric groundwater dataset bureau of meteorology 2012 a raster of groundwater levels was obtained from the monitoring bores included in the groundwater explorer http www bom gov au water groundwater by averaging the groundwater levels filtering out bores with mean groundwater levels greater than 35 m depth and with less than 10 observations in time and interpolating kriging the level of the remaining bores a map of soil hydraulic conductivity classes was obtained from the australian soil atlas http www asris csiro au themes atlas html a map of distances to agricultural areas distance to users was generated from the alum land use maps abares 2016 additionally daily gauging station data from the water nsw website https realtimedata waternsw com au and rainfall time series data from the silo website https legacy longpaddock qld gov au silo were also used all criteria maps were rasterized converted to the same coordinate system gcs wgs84 and clipped to the extension of the namoi basin 2 3 map reclassification and rating since mcda requires all data to be standardised and converted to the same schema sallwey et al 2018 all maps were reclassified and ranked as shown in table 1 based on a review of commonly used classes the data distribution and parameter ranges in this study in channel modifications and spreading methods were originally considered as potential techniques for the mar project therefore the criteria were selected and treated accordingly sites with low slopes have less runoff and are more suitable to promote infiltration therefore lower slopes were ranked higher since floods are considered as the source of water for the project and their occurrence takes place in the neighborhood of streams a closer distance to rivers is indicative of higher suitability however very small distances were also penalized ranked third in order to avoid the flow from the recharge project back to the stream from a water table mound caused by the project sophocleous 2002 long distances from the river were ranked lower because they imply higher costs for the project due to the need for hydraulic infrastructure to transport the water drainage density evaluated as the ratio between the length of the drainage path and the area that it covers km km 2 has been inversely related to the permeability because a denser underlying lithology causes higher runoff which leads to the development of a well defined drainage network ghayoumian et al 2007 raviraj et al 2017 thus drainage density was inversely ranked in equally separated classes hydrogeologic units were reclassified and ranked such that a range of different lithologies from the alluvial channel and floodplain sediments to intrusive igneous very strong sedimentary and metamorphic lithologies could be observed these were classified as having very high alluvial sediments to very low suitability hard rocks for the mar location aquifer hydraulic conductivity ks and yield were reclassified and ranked favouring higher conductivity and recovery yield rates aquifer salinities were classified and ranked based on a salinity classification for irrigation water developed by the victorian government http agriculture vic gov au groundwater depths were ranked using two criteria on the one hand very shallow depths constrain the potential for the project because the recharge in those areas can lead to groundwater discharge and water logging kazakis 2018 in addition some interaction between soil and sediment particles with the infiltrating solution which partly depends on the vadose zone depth is required to reduce the potential harm of groundwater pollution rahman et al 2012 on the other hand elevated groundwater depths based on darcy s law imply longer times for water transport and a higher residence time of ponded water which increases evaporation losses therefore intermediate depths were ranked higher in this study higher soil ks was ranked higher because as it was pointed out by arshad et al 2014 infiltration rates are one of the key properties of the physical medium that influences the economic feasibility of a mar project in a catchment since the purpose of the project is to increase the available groundwater for irrigation purposes smaller distances to irrigation fields distance to users were ranked higher 2 4 decision criteria and site suitability map the site suitability map to locate a project was based on a multi criteria decision analysis mcda using analytic hierarchy process ahp and pairwise comparisons the ahp technique is one of the most commonly used mcda tools which applies an eigenvalue approach to the pairwise comparisons vaidya and kumar 2006 reducing the subjectivity associated with the definition of weights kazakis 2018 the pairwise comparisons were carried out using the saaty s pairwise comparison scale between criteria pairs saaty 2012 which were treated independently the scale ranges between 1 where both criteria are equally important and 9 where one criterium is far more important than the other different pairwise comparisons were carried out to obtain a consolidated decision matrix through the geometric mean of individual matrices according to eq 1 1 c i j e x p 1 n k 1 n l n a i j k where cij is the consolidated decision matrix being i and j the rows and columns of the matrices k is each participant n the total number of participants and aij k corresponds to the decision matrix of each participant the ahp technique was evaluated through a consistency ratio cr which corresponds to the ratio between the consistency index of the pairwise comparison matrix ci and the consistency index of a random like matrix known as random index ri where values smaller than 0 1 are considered acceptable to continue the decision making analysis mu and pereyra rojas 2017 the consistency index is estimated by eq 2 2 c i λ m a x n n 1 where n is the number of compared elements n number of criteria and λmax is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix all ahp analysis was carried out using the online ahp os software https bpmsg com ahp online system goepel 2018 a sensitivity analysis was also carried out using 7 alternative weighting schemes table 2 for the criteria groups defined in table 1 mainly to find areas relatively insensitive to the weighting schemas in the first six scenarios the weights were alternately applied to the weightings obtained from the ahp technique such that one group was excluded from the analysis and the others split the weights into one and two thirds in the last scheme all criteria were equally weighted the final map of site suitability was obtained using eq 3 3 s i i 1 n w i r i where si stands for suitability index ranging from 0 to 5 being 5 the most suitable locations w and r correspond to the weights and rating of each criterion i respectively the site suitability map was subsequently reclassified into 6 classes which accounts for extremely low very low low moderate high and very high suitabilities the different schemas from the sensitivity analysis were also used to create suitability maps in order to compare the different criteria weighting the pre processing reclassification and rating of all criteria layers and the obtaining of the suitability maps were done using the qgis software qgis development team 2009 2 5 area of interest aoi and validation the selection of an aoi was carried out based on the areas that indicated a high and very high suitability in the map generated additionally low sensitivity to the weighting schemes was also considered for the selection of the aoi the validation of the area selected was based on an assessment of the natural recharge in the aoi in order to evaluate the natural recharge the master recession curve mrc was calculated for different monitoring wells contained in the australian groundwater explorer dataset from the hydrograph data bores related to the uppermost aquifer were selected additionally bores whose hydrographs indicated a strong intraseasonal fluctuation were neglected since it was assumed that those were caused by the pumping of irrigation water in the area or a high connection to lower aquifers that are used for extraction from the mrc the water table fluctuation method was used to derive recharge from the different hydrographs through eq 4 assuming a limited connection between the different aquifers in the aoi 4 r δ h δ t s y where r is recharge in a specific time interval t δh is the change in groundwater height and sy corresponds to the specific yield of the aquifer scanlon and healy 2002 since the namoi river plays an important role in the hydrological and hydrogeological response of the catchment especially in the alluvial aquifers recharge was assumed to be a response to rainfall a losing river system and floods taking place episodically in the floodplain adjacent to the main stream channel lamontagne et al 2015 studying the groundwater geochemistry in the catchment described two groundwater systems in the alluvial sediments a shallow one that contains mostly water infiltrated from the river and a deeper one that contains a mixture of young river recharge and old groundwater gab additionally iverach et al 2017 found the gab recharge into the alluvial aquifer system as being spatially variable since this study concentrates in the shallow aquifer in an aoi defined and since the gab discharge into the namoi alluvium was not distinguishable at most water level monitoring locations and in particular in the smaller focus area west of mollee weir to the west of narrabri this input was not taken into account even though the specific yield is a property that changes spatially in the aquifers depending on the composition of the sediments its estimation is difficult therefore a constant value of 0 05 was used in this study based on schlumberger water services australia reported value schlumberger water services australia 2012 however specific yield values between 0 01 and 0 1 are also expected in the alluvial aquifer higher values may be found in the main trunk channel associated with a higher composition of sand and gravel particles while adjacent areas of the floodplain where the composition of clay and silt particles increases lead to lower specific yield values 2 6 water availability the available water for the mar project was calculated constrained to the aoi it was calculated considering floods as the main source of water for the project from the set of hydrological stations in the catchment a gauge located in highly suitable areas was selected its rating curve was evaluated taking the inflection of the curve as the discharge point at which the stream breaks out of the channel and spreads to the adjacent floodplain a flood frequency curve was also carried out to evaluate the periodicity of such events and to quantify the available water that might be used for recharge purposes kuczera and franks 2016 a schema of the methodology is presented in fig 3 3 results 3 1 criteria maps the criteria maps are shown in fig 4 most of the maps are governed by the geomorphology of the catchment the slope gradient is one of the main factors creating the landscape and is associated with some hydrogeologic properties in this case slope hydrogeologic units and groundwater ks indicate similar patterns as it can be seen the most prohibitive criteria based on the area covered by very low suitability ranks are those that relate to the distance to rivers and users and also the aquifer yield which is mainly constrained by the alluvial deposits in the basin this is in contrast to the slope map which shows that most areas in the catchment have low slopes favorable for mar projects overall these maps highlight the importance of stream channels in the catchment development these carved in the overlying lithologies due to slope gradients build up erosional and depositional environments which finally lead to the generation of alluvial aquifers and soils at these locations surrounding the river channels most irrigated agriculture takes places 3 2 ahp analysis the comparisons between the different criteria layers generate a consolidated decision matrix which can be found in table a1 appendix section since the pairwise comparison matrix led to a consistency ratio cr of 0 013 it was assumed as consistent and we continued with further stages of the decision making process subsequently the decision hierarchy for the evaluated criteria was calculated table 3 as it can be seen slope aquifer salinity and hydrogeologic unit were ranked as the three most important criteria used several studies ghayoumian et al 2007 rahman et al 2012 valverde et al 2016 combine a boolean logic with mcda resulting in a first stage in which slope is selected as a criterium to mask suitability areas this demonstrates the importance of this criterium especially for surface spreading and in channel modification mar methodologies additionally we gave a high importance to the groundwater quality aquifer salinity since it would preclude the groundwater use for irrigation purposes which would make the mar project useless the hydrogeologic unit is also highly important since it depicts the medium where the infiltrated water is intended to be stored on the contrary the soil ks and the aquifer ks and yield were considered to have lower importance since these reduce the mar potential for groundwater recharge but would not make it non viable from the beginning such as the highly ranked criteria 3 3 site suitability and sensitivity analysis the suitability map obtained from the ahp is presented in fig 5 highly suitable areas for the location of the project are mainly observed close to the stream channels in the alluvial sediments the sensitivity analysis gave similar results in terms of site suitability maps using the different weighting schemes from table 2 except for the schemes 4 and 6 fig 6 which share a higher relative weighting 0 66 for the underground criteria including soil ks and groundwater depth therefore the weighting schemes prioritising surface or aquifer criteria change the site suitability map results to a lesser extent this constrains the suitable and highly suitable areas mostly to the alluvial deposits and whose highly suitable areas can be found in middle sections of the catchment an assessment of the areas covered by the different suitability classes is presented in table 4 for the sensitivity analysis scheme 3 which assigns a higher relative weighting to the aquifer properties has the evenest distribution between classes lower standard deviation while scheme 7 which uses an even weighting for all criteria is the most conservative approach for the site suitability map generation with a high deviation and the highest kurtosis the scheme resulting from the ahp indicates a high deviation between classes being mostly concentrated between areas of low and moderate suitability 3 4 aoi selection and assessment of suitability based on the locations that indicate high and very high suitability using the ahp and with highest agreement across the eight maps of the sensitivity analysis presented a low sensitivity to the weighting schemas used an area of interest aoi between narrabri and wee waa municipalities was drawn for the location of a mar project from this aoi a gauging station with more than 30 years of daily records was selected fig 7 the selection of the aoi also corresponds to an area where cotton irrigation agriculture is highly developed which spreads to the west of the catchment in addition the overall groundwater gradient of the shallow aquifer follows the slope of the terrain and the stream flow direction heading toward the west mccallum et al 2009 several farm dams can be observed in the aoi which store water for irrigation purposes several monitoring wells 20 are located in the aoi which present different hydrographic behaviour wells located near the namoi river in the surrounding paleochannels abandoned stream channels wray 2009 welsh et al 2014 show rapid peaks of groundwater level increase in the hydrograph which tend to smoothen in wells located farther away fig 8 these peaks correspond to recharge events kelly et al 2013 and are followed by clear recession behaviour additionally the aoi selected and all associated monitoring wells are located in areas that according to iverach et al 2017 lack of a gab contribution to recharge or where this is small and therefore the water fluctuation methodology used for recharge estimation was assumed correct since recharge is a response to natural processes rainfall streamflow it showed to be highly variable in time fig 9 additionally recharge estimates were also spatially variable fig 10 following the trend in the hydrographs high recharge values were estimated in monitoring wells located in the paleochannel surrounding the namoi river mean recharge estimates range from around 100 to over 700 mm y 1 the highest recharge corresponds to a monitoring well located in the western area of the aoi close to the namoi river where floods tend to inundate the surrounding area when compared to mean annual rainfall values obtained from the silo rainfall dataset annual recharge estimates in the different monitoring bores range from 2 3 to 21 4 of accumulated rainfall not shown with the lower percentages located in the eastern part of the aoi since a high spatial variability may be observed in the relatively small area that comprises the aoi recharge estimates obtained from the water fluctuation method must be interpreted as a local property instead of a regional value delin et al 2007 being highly affected by the underground sediments which are locally variable especially in the alluvium in the vicinity of the main stream channel kelly et al 2014 a correlation between recharge estimates and rainfall was carried out fig 11 left in addition a correlation between mean annual discharge from the selected gauging station and the annual recharge estimates for each bore was also carried out fig 11 right in general the mean annual river discharge leads to higher correlations with annual recharge estimates than the disaggregated rainfall the correlations between discharge and recharge are mostly in the 0 7 0 8 interval which implies a strong very strong relationship between variables in contrast correlation coefficients between rainfall and recharge estimates are mainly in the 0 4 0 7 interval indicating a moderate strong relationship between variables the high recharge estimates in the aoi which are higher in the vicinity of the namoi river indicate locations where the natural recharge can be used for a mar project since recharge events in the study area are strongly dependent on the streamflow spreading methods can be implemented in the palaeochannel surrounding the namoi river but also in channel modifications can be developed to increase the recharge from the namoi river 3 5 water availability from gauging data the hydrograph analysis of the selected gauging station is in fig 12 it presents the rating and flood frequency curves of the namoi river at mollee additionally a logarithmic regression was fitted to the flood frequency data dashed line from the hydrograph analysis a discharge value of approximately 500 m3 s 1 leads to an inflection in the rating curve which was assumed to be the discharge that leads to a flow that exceeds the channel storage capacity and therefore leads to floods over the surrounding floodplain then assuming that the mar project will capture at least one flood event within a return period of 5 years to replenish the groundwater storage this would correspond to a daily mean discharge of 883 m3 s 1 subtracting the discharge threshold obtained from the rating curve to this discharge at a 5 years return period leads to 383 m3 s 1 exceeding the stream channel capacity and causing flooding in the surrounding areas which implies a volume of over 33 g l per day that might be allocated for recharge purposes this volume constitutes around 8 of the keepit dam capacity the major dam in the catchment however return period were estimated using the annual maximum series while actually flood waves might take several days in traveling and receding fuentes et al 2019 this implies that floods usually take longer than a single day and therefore greater available water volumes for recharge are expected from such events for instance the flood occurred in november 2011 in the molle gauging station took around six days in receding with discharges over 800 m3 s 1 5 consecutive days over 1000 m3 s 1 which implied a volume of over 240 g l exceeding the channel more than half the storage capacity of the keepit dam which might be used to enhance recharge 4 discussion there are many studies coupling mcda and gis to evaluate the site suitability for mar projects rahman et al 2012 russo et al 2014 kazakis 2018 sallwey et al 2018 however several lack sensitivity analysis or validation of results ghayoumian et al 2007 chowdhury et al 2009 rahman et al 2012 owusu et al 2017 in this study the sensitivity analysis not only showed the effect of changing the criteria weights on the site suitability but it also allowed the selection of suitable areas which were less sensitive to the weighting decision in this study the weight assigned to the permeability of the soils criterium was ranked the lowest in opposition to arshad et al 2014 this is explained by the fact that the current study assessed mainly the physical suitability of mar projects rather than its economic feasibility since the permeability of the soil interface can be either enhanced or bypassed by using different artificial recharge techniques bouwer 2002 it becomes less significant than other criteria from a physical perspective validation is one of the most variable aspects in site suitability for mar projects for instance saidi et al 2017 suggest that there is no direct method to verify mar suitable sites and therefore indirect methods must be applied some studies ghayoumian et al 2007 mahmoud 2014 have used the presence of ongoing mar projects to validate their results kazakis 2018 assumed the consistency of the ahp technique and a subsequent sensitivity analysis to be enough for validation while russo et al 2014 used a numerical model to validate their results in the present study the natural recharge estimated through the water table fluctuation method in different monitoring wells was used to validate the aoi delineated since the preferred methods of recharge imply either spreading alternatives or in channel modifications one of the difficulties of estimating recharge is its spatio temporal variability which is frequently neglected manna et al 2019 it is also difficult to get recharge estimates due to the limitations of the different methodologies available for its quantification knowing this difficulty scanlon et al 2002 proposed the use of combined alternatives for a recharge estimation which makes the estimation harder there are several advantages and disadvantages in relation to the water table fluctuation methodology while it allows an estimate of groundwater recharge in time it depends on other properties such as the specific yield healy and cook 2002 which was assumed constant in this study additionally the connectivity between aquifers was neglected based on the hydrograph behavior however lamontagne et al 2015 and iverach et al 2017 studies present enough evidence to validate this approach used the temporal frequency of the recorded water levels tended to vary in the dataset during some of the time intervals sampling happened at low frequency such as quarterly which might affect the recharge estimates nevertheless since the hydrograph data is publicly available and has long time series it constitutes a valuable data source for local recharge estimations different studies have estimated recharge in the namoi catchment with quite variable results depending on the methodologies and study locations crosbie et al 2010 identified a recharge of 58 mm y 1 in the lower namoi area using the water table fluctuation mccallum et al 2010 by using the waves model estimated 14 mm y 1 of recharge but this was only valid for the specific date and location studied and assuming recharge was equivalent to drainage below 4 m depth abbs and littleboy 1998 used the perfect cropping model to evaluate recharge in the liverpool plains upper namoi catchment and estimated between 28 and 80 mm y 1 in agricultural black earth soils weaver et al 2013 using a chloride mass balance found deep drainage estimates from a few mm to around 400 mm between the 2010 2011 cotton growing season at three sites around namoi wee waa and merah north all located in the lower namoi cuthbert et al 2016 by studying an ephemeral stream tributary of maules creek in the upper namoi estimated from 30 to 80 mm y 1 of indirect recharge by using the water table fluctuation method timms et al 2012 studying two sites located in floodplains of the lower namoi modelled deep drainage using apsim and estimated drainage values between 3 3 and 9 5 mm y 1 all these studies prove that groundwater recharge in a catchment is spatially variable coincidentally in the selected aoi kelly et al 2009 evaluated the namoi river between the mollee close to narrabri and the gunidgera near wee waa weirs using continuous electrical imaging for mapping recharge and found potential recharge pathways in this reach of the namoi river the same study describes that the hydraulic connectivity between aquifers increases to the west beyond the aoi selected in this study and that in the range of longitudes that coincide with the current aoi is where most of the recharge occurs due to the presence of sand and gravels in the upper 10 m of sediments underlying the river which is also supported by some cross sectional profiles in lamontagne et al 2015 fig 13 these characteristics help to explain the variability and the high recharge estimates in the aoi which are also reported in williams et al 1969 for the gunidgera and mollee weir locations lamontagne et al 2015 studying the river infiltration in a reach of the namoi river between the molle and yarral weirs both included in the aoi found that the river behaved as a losing system most of the time except during floods in which the river led to bank recharge discharge cycles using hydrogeochemical analysis the study estimated infiltration rates ranging from 0 6 to 5 m y 1 iverach et al 2017 studying the groundwater mixing process in the lower namoi alluvium also found significant recharge during floods especially in monitoring wells near the river which present a high connectivity with the surface this study estimated high recharge values which are nevertheless within the range of recharge values found in the aforementioned literature these estimates are justified based on the locations where they were obtained which correspond to the surroundings of the namoi river in relatively high conductive sediments therefore these values may be used as a way to validate the results of the suitability map a previous study of the potential for a mar project in the catchment was carried out by woolley et al 1994 this identified potential sites for a mar trial located in some abandoned gravel pits near merah north in the lower namoi catchment the recharge in the area is described as small except when overbank flooding occurs the study also suggested potential trial sites in doreen lane located 9 km to the north of merah north but without specifying how to transport the water for the trial project two other sites were defined in the upper namoi catchment close to quirindi through the use of a weir and in the watermark area most of the areas mentioned were classified as having high suitabilities in the current study but were not as insensitive as the aoi selected woolley et al 1994 also estimated a monthly availability of 30 g l of water for a mar project however their study suggests to take such estimate with extreme caution and that it would coincide with floods since weirs increase the opportunity for river infiltration and the hydraulic head it is clear that these present a high potential for inducing recharge in the river kelly et al 2013 especially if these are located in highly conductive reaches hydrograph data gives clue of such unintentional benefit in the mollee weir however induced recharge estimates in this location have not been carried out these structures might be one of the ways to conceive the development of a mar project in the catchment taking advantage of the high conductivity of underlying sediments nevertheless groundwater monitoring bores are still too sparse and spaced to identify the higher conductive locations in the paleochannels surrounding the namoi river therefore a higher spatial resolution to find optimal recharge locations by geophysical surveys and detailed lithological coring in the region is still required for the emplacement of a mar project that may operate under spreading or in channel modification techniques there are several studies that discuss the role of floods in groundwater recharge doble et al 2013 in another australian catchment found that floods contributed a 4 of the total recharge being 17 of the riparian recharge kelly et al 2013 discussed the peaks in namoi groundwater hydrographs as depicting flood recharge regarding the river system brownbill et al 2011 described the studied reach of the namoi river as a connected losing system which is recharging groundwater since during floods the water levels in the stream channels also rise these lead to a higher hydraulic gradient which implies higher recharge also explaining the dependence of recharge on the river discharge although available water estimates from floods can be calculated that does not necessarily mean that such volumes can be used for irrigation regulations and entitlements are strong constraints on the potential use of available water even in surplus periods such as during floods since mar has got a relatively slow acceptance dillon et al 2018 regulations regarding its applicability are still a limiting factor however increased recharge into the groundwater can have additional benefits in relation to overall groundwater sustainability several mar projects that use spreading or in channel modification systems are in operation however these are considerably less popular than bank filtration sprenger et al 2017 which is mainly used as a water treatment system maeng 2010 spreading methods to enhance recharge have historically been used and are currently the second most common technique to implement mar in europe with 77 active sites in 2013 sprenger et al 2017 however such projects have also been implemented successfully in other continents for instance the development of pilot projects for mar under spreading methods has been implemented since the 1960 s in arizona united states dillon et al 2018 and are envisaged in the present as important ways to recharge depleted aquifers in the central valley of california by on farm recharge flooding kocis and dahlke 2017 in japan a spreading basin operating since 2009 in alluvial fans has been reported as contributing to the sustainable management of the local aquifer hida 2009 regarding in channel modification projects sprenger et al 2017 only mention one active project in europe while dillon et al 2018 describes that it has been applied extensively in india but also in china even though the site suitability map generated indicates potential areas for a mar project implementation and even though a validation of one of the potential sites was carried out the numerical modeling of different artificial recharge alternatives should be carried out to assess the impact of such project on the surroundings additionally no water quality assessment has been considered in this study which is also required before the implementation of a pilot project therefore further studies addressing these issues and analysing other mcda alternatives and their corresponding uncertainties will be matter for future investigations finally the modeling of the groundwater response to the mar project located in the selected aoi might also be a subject for future research 5 conclusions the combined use of mcda and gis is a valuable tool for the selection of suitable sites for mar projects these can allow a consistency analysis and represent useful alternatives that can shed light on territorial planning through the use of publicly available data in low local data environments this resulted finally in the generation of a site suitability map additionally sensitivity analysis allows an assessment of criteria weighting and the selection of aois to locate potential mar projects at a catchment scale however the selected mcda does not allow for a quantification of the uncertainties in the weighting process and strongly relies on the user s judgment to prioritise different criteria having restricted applicability for more automatised tasks the validation process used estimates the natural groundwater recharge to highlight its spatial variability but also showed that natural recharge was strongly dependent on the river streamflow patterns this analysis also confirms how floods and streamflow are a significant source of recharge in the catchment moreover recharge estimates in the selected aoi are high yet higher estimates can be associated to the paleochannel surrounding the namoi river among the different techniques for mar projects weirs might be built in conductive reaches of the stream network to enhance groundwater recharge this study provides potential locations and spatio temporal estimates of locally available water for mar which might be derived from floods by using spread or in channel modification methods however the practical use of this water for mar and irrigation would be limited by local regulations and water entitlements even though this study finds potential sites for a mar project geophysical surveys or detailed lithological coring might further constrain the selection of optimal sites based on the conductive properties of the sediments author contributions original idea i f data preprocessing and coding i f supervision r w v draft writing i f draft edition r w v funding this

8392,study region the kabompo river basin krb in zambia is one of the 13 basins found in the zambezi river basin in southern african region study focus global climate model gcms projections have spatial resolution of up to several hundred kilometres which may not be adequate for capturing local details mostly needed for impact assessment at local and regional scale downscaling techniques developed to improve the detail include regional climate modelling and statistical techniques linking climate information at gcm resolution with that at local scale this paper deals with evaluation and assessment of the impact of climate change on water balance for the krb in order to evaluate climate change impact six bias corrected and downscaled gcm outputs were acquired and used as inputs for hydrological modelling with the swat model to determine the impact under two future climate scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that the future catchment water balance for krb under rcp4 5 will have insignificant variation from the current catchment water balance as annual statistics show that rainfall will reduce by 1 while water yield and runoff will increase by 5 and 6 respectively meanwhile under rcp8 5 annual statistics show that rainfall will increase by 19 while water yield and runoff will increase by 40 and 65 respectively and resulting in a significant increase in catchment water balance keywords catchment water balance simulations water resources global climate models krb 1 introduction global climate models gcm have often been used to simulate the present and future climates and many scientists in the world have carried out studies of climate zhang et al 2006 unfccc 2001 gcms generate projections of possible future changes over different periods with varying time scales which have no exact previous historical climates liu et al 2012 simulations of the present day climate by gcms are used to build confidence in the simulation of future climate by the models however such opportunities are much more limited in climate prediction than in weather prediction randall and wood 2012 these gcm projections may have spatial resolution of up to several hundred kilometres which may not be adequate to be used for capturing the local detail needed for impact assessment at local and regional scale ipcc 2013 murphy and ro 2006 jones et al 2004 methods to improve this detail also known as downscaling have been developed and include dynamical downscaling i e regional climate modelling and statistical techniques linking climate information at gcm resolution with that at local level or point location randall and wood 2012 jones et al 2004 evaluation and assessment of the impact of climate change on water resources in the krb was performed for the purposes of developing adaptation and mitigation strategies in order to evaluate climate change impacts six downscaled and bias corrected gcms were acquired and used in modelling climate change under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios therefore this paper is focussed on evaluating climate change impacts on catchment water balance more specifically rainfall water yield and runoff variables for different time scales in the kabompo river basin krb 1 1 study area the krb is within the zambezi river basin zrb located between 14o 15 07 29 s 23o 08 27 44 e and 17o 36 17 21 s 25o 48 28 39 e it is one of the 13 basins in the zrb which has deep well drained kalahari sands covering the entire region beilfuss 2012 the basin has wooded savannahs as the predominant landuse and has mean annual precipitation map of 1200 mm fig 1 indicates the location of the study area in the zrb of southern africa 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of gcms the research utilised six gcms obtained from the nasa earth exchange nex global daily downscaled projections thrasher et al 2015 the nex gddp dataset is composed of downscaled and bias corrected global climate scenarios produced from the general circulation model gcm runs performed through the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 furthermore the selection of the six models was also based on how good they are in the study region have different climate sensitivities and hence provide a wide range of outcomes they have been extensively used across the globe and have capabilities of producing reliable results burger et al 2013 abatzoglou and brown 2012 utilising a couple of gcms has advantages of reducing uncertainties in climate change projections sung and chung 2018 abatzoglou and brown 2012 table 1 shows the summary of gcms used in the study 2 1 1 prediction of changes in hydrology and water resources using gcms gcms are one of the most widely used tools for modelling current and future climate scenarios for prediction river et al 2016 liu et al 2012 wilby and harris 2006 nevertheless the scientific community have reached a consensus that gcm outputs should not be used directly as an input in hydrological models that are mostly used on spatial scales smaller than those of gcms farzan et al 2013 in order to predict changes in hydrology and water resources gcm outputs on a global scale require downscaling into the inputs of the hydrological model on a regional or local scale river et al 2016 farzan et al 2013 this is done to improve the accuracy of the results with reference to specific region or local scale in view of the aforementioned spatial downscaling and bias correction of gcm outputs are a requirement prior to their use in regional impact studies farzan et al 2013 downscaling gcm outputs is widely performed through dynamic and statistical methods the six gcms under analysis in this study were statistically downscaled and bias corrected for hydrological modelling at a regional scale 2 2 gcms data source the six gcms in table 1 were composed of downscaled global climate scenarios produced from the general circulation model gcm runs performed through the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 the gcm runs were conducted over two 2 representative concentration pathways rcps namely rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 meinshausen et al 2010 the cmip5 gcm runs were produced to support the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 the datasets were chosen because they provide a set of global high resolution bias corrected climate change projections that can be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are sensitive to finer scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography on climate conditions thrasher et al 2015 furthermore availability of daily simulation for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 representative concentration pathways scenarios was considered in selection process of gcms the rcp4 5 is a middle pathway scenario that correlates well with the recently released guidelines of lower greenhouse emission by the international community it is therefore a good case sensitive scenario in light of the new guidelines rcp 8 5 is a high emission scenario which provides the possible highest impact on climate change it is for the above mentioned reasons that rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were selected to provide a possible complete range of impact khan et al 2018 2 3 the gcms projections the six gcms were obtained from 21 cmip5 gcms with 42 climate projections under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the period 2006 2100 and the climate of the recent past experiment that was conducted from 1950 to 2005 for each model every climate projection was downscaled to a spatial resolution of 0 25deg x 0 25deg about 25 km x 25 km thrasher et al 2015 the projections for climate change were based on six gcms and the two rcps baseline experiment for the period of 1975 2005 the baseline was found to be reasonably accurate in replicating the main climate effects in the krb the analysis of rainfall water yield and runoff changes in the entire river basin was done at different time scales and an ensemble of six gcms was used because of the huge benefits of depending on the many model outputs liu et al 2012 river et al 2016 daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were generated with swat weather generator based on statistical information swat model was used to simulate rainfall water yield and runoff for kabompo river basin krb which was delineated with an area of 72 078 km2 and sub divided into 102 sub basins with 255 hydrological response units hru swat was then used to simulate three climate scenarios as follows a baseline period with 31 years 1975 2005 and stochastically completed climate data rcp4 5 2020 2050 period with gcms climate change projections to modify baseline data and rcp8 5 2020 2050 period with gcms climate change projections to modify baseline data 2 4 hydrological modelling the gcm output were statistically downscaled to the region and used as input data for hydrological modelling statistical downscaling is mostly used as a conduit for linking gcm outputs with hydrological models due to insignificant computing resources required and can incorporate observations into method it is worth noting that there is uncertainty in modelling impact of climate change on water resources which starts with socio economic story lines future climate scenarios and actual impact modelling murphy and ro 2006 hydrological models therefore provide the means for relating climate changes to water resources by simulating the hydrological processes in river basins the most widely used hydrological model in simulating climate change effect is the soil and water assessment tool swat wang et al 2012 arnold et al 2009 swat is a continuous watershed scale model that simulates major components of the hydrological processes on a daily time step neitsch et al 2005 neitsch et al 2005 the swat model was firstly calibrated with 15 years 1982 1997 monthly flow data and validated with 8 years 1998 2005 monthly flow data the model reached the objective function for nash sutcliff ns of 0 73 at calibration and 0 64 at validation while the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 73 at calibration and 0 70 at validation the model was further subjected to uncertainty analysis with sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 where the p factor was determined to be 0 75 during calibration and 0 73 during validation while the r factor was determined to be 0 75 during calibration and 0 55 during validation and was therefore a very good result to be used for simulation of the gcm outputs in this study land use and land cover were kept constant during swat simulations for future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 therefore climate change was the only factor influencing catchment water balance 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of climate change on catchment water balance the results from six gcm projections that were simulated by swat model showed variations in increased and decreased water balance components in all the months under review for the kabompo basin the variation in water balance components were also in all the seasons except for june july and august jja season where no rainfall was simulated however the increases in rainfall water yield and runoff were larger under rcp8 5 than the rcp4 5 scenarios the highest rainfall increases were simulated by access1 0 under rcp8 5 when compared with the remaining five 5 gcms whilst the same gcm also simulated the lowest rainfall under rcp4 5 amongst the six gcms this could be as a result of different responses of various gcms to the same climate scenarios and therefore creates fundamental uncertainties in climate change projections li and jin 2017 stone et al 2003 the models have various baseline climates when compared and have different sensitivities to changes in emission scenarios carolina et al 2003 the impact model swat was therefore analysed for sensitivity to the two rcps representing the climate change at two various spatial scales that are physically related hydrological model results are summarised for baseline period 1975 2005 rcp4 5 2020 2050 and rcp8 5 2020 2050 future climate scenarios the rainfall water yield and runoff are investigated at monthly seasonal and annual time scales water yield wyld is the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin to contribute to stream flow stone et al 2003 it is calculated by eq no 1 as follows 1 wyld qsurf qgw qlat qloss runoff is the surface runoff simulated by swat model using the soil conservation service scs curve number method mohammad 2016 peak runoff indicates the erosive power of a storm and is many times used in the prediction of loss of sediments rostamian 2010 peak runoff rate is calculated in swat model using the modified rational method chow et al 1988 the six gcm projections were simulated with swat model their mean was calculated and the results are shown in fig 2 as ensemble simulations the swat simulated ensemble and the mean for baseline rainfall and water yield in fig 2 shows minor variations and that the highest rainfall of 200 250 mm occurs in january and december with p ispl cm5a lr simulating the highest rainfall in january exceeding the other five the simulations also show that rainfall for february march and april occurs in a decreasing order before finally ending in may where there is insignificant rainfall fig 2 further shows no simulation for rainfall in june and july but insignificant rainfall is simulated in august and september while for october november and december rainfall is simulated in an increasing order the water yield is a direct response to the rainfall in the basin and swat model simulates the highest water yield in january and december with 55 60 mm from the ensemble gcms the water yield decreases as rainfall reduces but maintains above 15 mm in may to september when there is either no rainfall or negligible the water yield rises again from october to december due to rainfall increase in general the swat simulated rainfall and water yield based on six gcms shows a consensus with insignificant uncertainties the ensemble runoff simulations and their calculated mean were also plotted with ensemble rainfall to further compare between the individual gcms and analyse the impact and uncertainty and the results are shown on fig 3 the swat simulated ensemble and the mean for baseline runoff in fig 3 shows minor variations in the rain season indicating uncertainty and differences in model skill the ensemble runoff is slightly high in january february march november and december when rainfall is also high and tend to decrease with decreasing rainfall occurring in april september and october the model simulates no runoff from may to end of august as must be the case since rainfall is also absent the stream flow is composed of just base flow mainly coming from the water yield runoff also rises from september to december as a direct response to rainfall the runoff simulated from cnrm cm5 output gives the highest runoff of 29 mm in january while ispl cm5a lr output gave the lowest runoff of 12 mm in the same period in order to understand the baseline period better generally swat simulated water yield based on six gcms shows a consensus with insignificant uncertainties and variabilities further comparisons were made between monthly rainfalls actual evapotranspiration et of the swat simulated gcm outputs and the results are shown in fig 4 the swat simulated ensemble and the mean for evapotranspiration et in fig 4 shows no variations and that et ranged from 87 74 mm for january to april which is also the rain season and temperatures are generally low however from april to june there is a sharp decrease due to the transitional period that ends spring season with rainfall in april and begins winter season cold season in june with the lowest temperatures recorded in the year et further decreases to zero or insignificant between june to september before rising gently to 81 mm in december this may be attributed to the rise in temperature the june july and august jja season is characterised with low temperatures as it is the winter season and temperatures begin to rise in september in general the swat simulated et based on six gcms shows a consensus with insignificant uncertainties 3 2 comparisons of gcms ensemble means and observed data the gcm ensemble means were used to compare with observed data for the same historical period for validation the focus was rainfall and temperature data obtained from zambia meteorological department zmd which was observed from five 5 weather stations in the krb for the baseline period 1975 2005 temperature was also plotted on the same graph to show the temporal variability across the basin fig 5 indicates the graphical comparisons of gcm ensemble mean and observed climate variables fig 5 shows a good match between gcm ensemble means for baseline period and observed rainfall for the same period except for october and november where there is a notable mismatch the baseline temperature is slightly over estimated when compared to the observed temperature for maximum minimum and average temperatures this could be attributed to inherent gcm uncertainties and the sparsely located ground weather stations however the baseline was still found to be suitable for determination of change factor for future temperatures because the regime is the same and the differences show some uncertainties coming from the wide coverage of ground observed weather stations and the inherent uncertainties in gcms fig 6 shows the location of the ground weather stations for observed stations the rainfall ensemble mean was further subjected to a trend analysis to determine its suitability for hydrological impact studies a correlation efficiency was determined between the observed and the ensemble mean rainfall data sets the results on fig 7 indicate a correlation efficiency of 96 which confirmed the reliability of the ensemble mean for use in hydrological impact studies the graph in fig 7 shows good correlation efficiency at 96 and therefore gives confidence to use the ensemble mean as a baseline for climate change analysis 3 3 seasonal catchment water balance for baseline ensemble mean the seasons for the krb are defined to be december january and february djf march april and may mam june july and august jja and september october and november son seasonal changes in catchment water balance are useful for planning of agricultural production tourism environmental flow concessions water supply industrial development and hydropower generation the baseline seasonal changes of the catchment water balance were plotted to show variability and fig 8 shows the results fig 8 shows the highest seasonal rainfall of 620 mm and the highest runoff of 58 mm recorded in djf while the highest water yield of 256 mm was recorded in son the season of son receives the second largest rainfall followed by mam and lastly jja when no rain is recorded djf shows the second highest water yield followed by mam and the lowest is recorded in jja son and mam shows the 18 mm and 16 mm runoff respectively while jja has no rainfall and runoff but has considerable water yield this is the baseline flow regime analysed for a period of 31 years 1975 2005 3 4 future changes in catchment water balance under rcp4 5 the gcm ensemble were analysed under the rcp4 5 2020 2050 to detect the change signal and quantify the magnitude of change with respect to catchment water balance components the study focussed on rainfall and water yield with runoff runoff was separated to show its contribution in water yield and its relationship with rainfall different temporal scales were considered under rcp4 5 climate scenario including annual monthly and seasonal across the basin this was done to understand the occurences of the changes with their magnitude 3 4 1 monthly changes fig 9 shows the individual gcm monthly changes in water balance as simulated by swat fig 9 a and f shows a decrease of rainfall in all the months except for january where there is an moderate increase and may which has the highest increase among all gcms in figure a and april in figure f while water yield of both figures show a decrease for all the months the highest decrease in rainfall of more than 50 is shown in may under fig 9 e and the highest runoff of more than 100 is shown in april under the same figure fig 9 d predicts moderate increase in rainfall and water yield in all months except may october and december while fig 9 e c and b indicate moderate decreases and increases of rainfall and water yield the results of gcm ensemble show uncertainty because various gcms responded differently to external forcing formulation of models and the process of downscaling one of the most widely used change factor methodology in climate change impact studies cfm trzaska and schnarr 2014 hamududu 2012 anandhi et al 2011 chen et al 2011 was used to obtain an overview of the change for the entire basin by analysing gcm ensemble mean under rcp4 5 and the baseline ensemble mean the results of the change under rcp4 5 are indicated on fig 10 the gcm ensemble mean in fig 10 indicate a slight increase in monthly rainfall for december january february and march while october and november show a significant decrease the water yield and runoff when compared with a baseline ensemble also show a slight increase the results clearly show that monthly rainfall water yield and runoff has increased in december january february and march while rainfall decreased by 19 and 4 in october and november respectively the highest rainfall increase of 3 is predicted in january followed by 2 in february and december the highest monthly water yield is predicted to be 10 and 8 in march and january respectively and the highest and lowest runoff is predicted to be 13 in december and 50 in october respectively there is a slight increase in water yield between april and september 3 4 2 seasonal changes there are significant variations in water balance components based on seasons which have also affected the catchment water balance fig 11 shows the seasonal changes in rainfall water yield and runoff fig 11 shows that rainfall in djf will increase by 2 across the basin while water yield will increase by 7 and runoff by 11 rainfall and water yield will increase in mam by 1 and 6 respectively while runoff increases by 5 in jja no rainfall and runoff is predicted while water yield is predicted to increase by 2 the son season shows a rainfall decrease of 8 while runoff also decreases by 5 and water yield will slightly increase by 1 this decrease may lead to seasonal drought requiring major interventions in general the figure shows insignificant changes in rainfall while keeping runoff with considerable changes 3 4 3 annual changes the annual changes under rcp4 5 for the next period of 2020 2050 predict that rainfall will decrease by 1 while water yield and runoff will increase by 5 and 6 respectively table 2 show the results of the changes in ensemble mean the results under rcp4 5 predict that runoff in djf will have a considerable increase of 11 while the changes in the rest of the seasons in rainfall and other hydrological variables are generally insignificant throughout the period the annual rainfall show insignificant reduction of 1 and a small increase of 5 in water yield while runoff increased by 6 the annual water balance components show that the rcp4 5 and baseline periods will have insignificant variations 3 4 4 future changes in catchment water balance under rcp8 5 the gcm ensemble was further analysed under the rcp8 5 2020 2050 to detect the change signal and quantify the magnitude of change with respect to water balance components the swat simulations were considered under monthly seasonal and annual time scales across the basin in order to analyse the variability of changes with their magnitude 3 4 5 monthly changes fig 12 shows the monthly changes in water balance for individual gcms as simulated by swat fig 12 a shows the p access1 0 with the highest increase in rainfall water yield and runoff in january february march november and december when compared with the other five gcms the increase in rainfall ranges from 3 to 180 while water yield and runoff it ranges from 83 to 534 and 153 1628 respectively the results show huge differences with the remaining five gcms fig 12 b indicates p cnrm cm5 with a decrease in rainfall water yield and runoff for january and march while showing a moderate increase in the water balance components in february november december and april the largest runoff increase of 416 is predicted in october and the remaining months of may june july august and september have insignificant rainfall water yield with no runoff predictions fig 12 c shows p ipsl cm5a lr with moderate increase in the water balance for january february march and december while october and november shows a decrease the increase in rainfall and runoff ranges from 8 to 50 and 12 80 respectively while water yield ranges from 4 to 31 while predicting the largest decrease in rainfall and runoff in october at 39 and 99 respectively there is a water yield increase of 10 from may to september but without rainfall and runoff perhaps due to a contribution of base flow fig 12 d shows p miroc5 with a similar trend to 3 11 c where there is a moderate increase in water balance for the same months while april and october have a decrease there is also a slight increase in water yield between may to august fig 12 e shows p mpi esm mr with march september october and november to have a decrease of 3 36 in rainfall while january february and april show an increase in rainfall water yield and runoff the figure also shows an increase in water yield and runoff for march november and december while also showing a notable decrease in water yield from may to september fig 12 f shows p mri cgcm3 with a considerable decrease of rainfall in april december november and february in the order of 25 16 13 and 7 the figure also shows that january march september and october have also an increase in rainfall water yield and runoff while may to august have a decrease in water yield and no rainfall and runoff is predicted there are considerable differences in gcm results which can be attributed to uncertainty emanating from external forcing downscaling and modelling processes the results from gcm p access1 0 show significant increase in catchment water balance and far above the remaining five gcms for the future period there are also wide variations in the five gcms and this could be due to uncertainties aforementioned there is therefore no consensus in the six gcm results shown in fig 12 in order to obtain an overview of the change for the entire basin further analysis was performed between the gcm ensemble mean under rcp8 5 and the baseline ensemble mean the results of the change under rcp8 5 are indicated on fig 13 the results in fig 13 clearly show that monthly water balance will significantly increase in november december january february and march rainfall and runoff will increase in the ranges of 9 39 and 31 232 respectively rainfall is expected to decrease in in october september may and april in the range of 1 13 the highest rainfall increase is 39 predicted in february followed by 31 in december and january followed by 27 predicted in march and lastly 9 predicted in november the highest monthly water yield and runoff is predicted to be 106 and 232 in february respectively the lowest decrease in runoff is predicted in april with 27 while may june july august and september are predicted with no runoff but 23 26 increase in water yield 3 4 6 seasonal changes the seasonal water balance varies from season to season the djf season is predicted to have the highest water balance followed by mam then son and lastly jja in that order fig 14 shows the seasonal variability of water balance fig 14 shows a significant increase of runoff in djf at 211 while predicting 174 rise in mam and 105 in son with no runoff in jja the figure also shows 98 increase in water yield for djf followed by 58 in mam 23 in jja and lastly 14 in son the increase in rainfall is predicted to be 36 in djf followed 20 in mam and lastly 5 in son the jja season is predicted with no rain as is the case with the current basin scenario 3 4 7 annual changes the annual changes under rcp8 5 2020 2050 show that the annual water balance will increase in general rainfall will increase by 19 27 and water yield and runoff will increase by 40 and 65 respectively table 3 shows the annual changes the results under rcp8 5 predict a general increase in annual water balance annual rainfall and runoff will increase by 19 and 65 respectively while annual water yield will increase by 40 the general rise in annual water balance may culminate into excessive water availability and high storage of groundwater 3 4 8 analysis of future catchment water balance further analysis was performed to compare catchment water balance under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the results were plotted and shown in fig 15 the comparison of seasonal water balance in fig 15 shows no consensus of the two future climate scenarios the water balance analysed under rcp8 5 is clearly much more than that of the rcp4 5 the seasonal rainfall change under rcp8 5 range from 5 35 while rcp4 5 does not show any significant seasonal changes except for 8 decrease in son the figure also shows that the catchment water balance under rcp4 5 will have insignificant variations with the baseline catchment water balance another analysis was performed to compare and contrast the annual catchment water balance and the results are shown in table 4 table 4 shows that the annual changes in water balance under rcp4 5 are insignificant and therefore unlikely to alter the current water balance the changes under rcp8 5 are significant and most likely will increase the catchment water balance to unprecedented levels nevertheless the scenario under rcp8 5 characterised with high uncertainty due to non consensus of the swat simulated gcm projections results therefore in general the future is predicted with two scenarios which can be summarised as the future catchment water balance without changes from the current status but with increased water demand and the future water balance with significant increase above the current status with excessive surplus 4 conclusion the impact of climate change on catchment water balance based on gcms is different and depends on temporal resolution and the climate scenarios the monthly changes under rcp4 5 indicate a slight increase in monthly rainfall for december january february and march while october and november show a significant decrease the water yield and runoff when compared with a baseline also show a slight increase the results clearly show that monthly rainfall water yield and runoff has increased in december january february and march while rainfall decreased by 19 and 4 in october and november respectively the highest rainfall increase of 3 is predicted in january followed by 2 in february and december the highest monthly water yield is predicted to be 10 and 8 in march and january respectively and the highest and lowest runoff is predicted to be 13 in december and 50 in october respectively there is a slight increase in water yield between april and september the overall changes in monthly water balance are not significant under this scenario the monthly changes under rcp8 5 show that monthly water balance will significantly increase in november december january february and march rainfall and runoff will increase in the ranges of 9 39 and 31 232 respectively rainfall is expected to decrease in in october september may and april in the range of 1 13 the highest rainfall increase is 39 predicted in february followed by 31 in december and january followed by 27 predicted in march and lastly 9 predicted in november the highest monthly water yield and runoff is predicted to be 106 and 232 in february respectively the lowest decrease in runoff is predicted in april with 27 while may june july august and september are predicted with no runoff but 23 26 increase in water yield the seasonal changes under rcp4 5 predicts 11 seasonal runoff increase in djf while the changes in the rest of the seasons in rainfall and water yield is generally insignificant throughout the period the annual rainfall will reduce by 1 while water yield and runoff will increase by 5 and 6 respectively the individual gcm results show insignificant uncertainties and a good consensus the catchment water balance under this scenario will not deviate considerably from the baseline and therefore the major concern would be to enhance management of water resources because of the demand which is likely to double by the end of the 31 year period for municipal water supply environmental industrial agricultural energy sector and mining sector the evaluated impact under this scenario gives a status quo of water resources with the baseline period the seasonal changes under rcp8 5 scenario predicts significant increases in water balance that has a strong likelihood of increasing catchment water balance the seasonal increases of runoff at 211 rainfall at 35 may indicate occurrence of excessive catchment water balance the comparison of seasonal water balance under the two rcps shows no consensus of the future climate scenarios the water balance analysed under rcp8 5 is clearly much more than that of the rcp4 5 the seasonal rainfall change under rcp8 5 range from 5 35 while rcp4 5 does not show any significant seasonal changes except for 8 decrease in son the catchment water balance under rcp4 5 will have insignificant variations with the baseline catchment water balance annual statistics under rcp8 5 show a significant increase of 65 40 and 19 in runoff water yield and rainfall respectively while under rcp4 5 there is an annual reduction in rainfall of 1 and an increase in runoff and water yield of 6 and 5 respectively generally rcp8 5 climate scenario shows high uncertainties of gcms simulations than rcp4 5 climate scenario in the krb the variability of individual gcms is also wide and shows no good consensus under rcp8 5 as compared with rcp4 5 results the six gcms have demonstrated a rare skill in modelling climate change for krb there is significant increase under rcp8 5 in catchment water balance at monthly seasonal and annual time scales the prediction may call for preparedness in disaster mitigation and adaptation review of policies review of designs of hydraulic structures flood mapping and awareness campaign meanwhile under rcp4 5 the evaluated catchment water balance at monthly seasonal and annual time scales may also call for integrated water resources management of available water resources against a growing water demand in the krb further research will be required for evaluation of the impact of climate change on streamflow water quality flood mapping of flood prone areas and rainfall intensity in order to

8392,study region the kabompo river basin krb in zambia is one of the 13 basins found in the zambezi river basin in southern african region study focus global climate model gcms projections have spatial resolution of up to several hundred kilometres which may not be adequate for capturing local details mostly needed for impact assessment at local and regional scale downscaling techniques developed to improve the detail include regional climate modelling and statistical techniques linking climate information at gcm resolution with that at local scale this paper deals with evaluation and assessment of the impact of climate change on water balance for the krb in order to evaluate climate change impact six bias corrected and downscaled gcm outputs were acquired and used as inputs for hydrological modelling with the swat model to determine the impact under two future climate scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that the future catchment water balance for krb under rcp4 5 will have insignificant variation from the current catchment water balance as annual statistics show that rainfall will reduce by 1 while water yield and runoff will increase by 5 and 6 respectively meanwhile under rcp8 5 annual statistics show that rainfall will increase by 19 while water yield and runoff will increase by 40 and 65 respectively and resulting in a significant increase in catchment water balance keywords catchment water balance simulations water resources global climate models krb 1 introduction global climate models gcm have often been used to simulate the present and future climates and many scientists in the world have carried out studies of climate zhang et al 2006 unfccc 2001 gcms generate projections of possible future changes over different periods with varying time scales which have no exact previous historical climates liu et al 2012 simulations of the present day climate by gcms are used to build confidence in the simulation of future climate by the models however such opportunities are much more limited in climate prediction than in weather prediction randall and wood 2012 these gcm projections may have spatial resolution of up to several hundred kilometres which may not be adequate to be used for capturing the local detail needed for impact assessment at local and regional scale ipcc 2013 murphy and ro 2006 jones et al 2004 methods to improve this detail also known as downscaling have been developed and include dynamical downscaling i e regional climate modelling and statistical techniques linking climate information at gcm resolution with that at local level or point location randall and wood 2012 jones et al 2004 evaluation and assessment of the impact of climate change on water resources in the krb was performed for the purposes of developing adaptation and mitigation strategies in order to evaluate climate change impacts six downscaled and bias corrected gcms were acquired and used in modelling climate change under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios therefore this paper is focussed on evaluating climate change impacts on catchment water balance more specifically rainfall water yield and runoff variables for different time scales in the kabompo river basin krb 1 1 study area the krb is within the zambezi river basin zrb located between 14o 15 07 29 s 23o 08 27 44 e and 17o 36 17 21 s 25o 48 28 39 e it is one of the 13 basins in the zrb which has deep well drained kalahari sands covering the entire region beilfuss 2012 the basin has wooded savannahs as the predominant landuse and has mean annual precipitation map of 1200 mm fig 1 indicates the location of the study area in the zrb of southern africa 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of gcms the research utilised six gcms obtained from the nasa earth exchange nex global daily downscaled projections thrasher et al 2015 the nex gddp dataset is composed of downscaled and bias corrected global climate scenarios produced from the general circulation model gcm runs performed through the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 furthermore the selection of the six models was also based on how good they are in the study region have different climate sensitivities and hence provide a wide range of outcomes they have been extensively used across the globe and have capabilities of producing reliable results burger et al 2013 abatzoglou and brown 2012 utilising a couple of gcms has advantages of reducing uncertainties in climate change projections sung and chung 2018 abatzoglou and brown 2012 table 1 shows the summary of gcms used in the study 2 1 1 prediction of changes in hydrology and water resources using gcms gcms are one of the most widely used tools for modelling current and future climate scenarios for prediction river et al 2016 liu et al 2012 wilby and harris 2006 nevertheless the scientific community have reached a consensus that gcm outputs should not be used directly as an input in hydrological models that are mostly used on spatial scales smaller than those of gcms farzan et al 2013 in order to predict changes in hydrology and water resources gcm outputs on a global scale require downscaling into the inputs of the hydrological model on a regional or local scale river et al 2016 farzan et al 2013 this is done to improve the accuracy of the results with reference to specific region or local scale in view of the aforementioned spatial downscaling and bias correction of gcm outputs are a requirement prior to their use in regional impact studies farzan et al 2013 downscaling gcm outputs is widely performed through dynamic and statistical methods the six gcms under analysis in this study were statistically downscaled and bias corrected for hydrological modelling at a regional scale 2 2 gcms data source the six gcms in table 1 were composed of downscaled global climate scenarios produced from the general circulation model gcm runs performed through the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 the gcm runs were conducted over two 2 representative concentration pathways rcps namely rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 meinshausen et al 2010 the cmip5 gcm runs were produced to support the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 the datasets were chosen because they provide a set of global high resolution bias corrected climate change projections that can be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are sensitive to finer scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography on climate conditions thrasher et al 2015 furthermore availability of daily simulation for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 representative concentration pathways scenarios was considered in selection process of gcms the rcp4 5 is a middle pathway scenario that correlates well with the recently released guidelines of lower greenhouse emission by the international community it is therefore a good case sensitive scenario in light of the new guidelines rcp 8 5 is a high emission scenario which provides the possible highest impact on climate change it is for the above mentioned reasons that rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were selected to provide a possible complete range of impact khan et al 2018 2 3 the gcms projections the six gcms were obtained from 21 cmip5 gcms with 42 climate projections under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the period 2006 2100 and the climate of the recent past experiment that was conducted from 1950 to 2005 for each model every climate projection was downscaled to a spatial resolution of 0 25deg x 0 25deg about 25 km x 25 km thrasher et al 2015 the projections for climate change were based on six gcms and the two rcps baseline experiment for the period of 1975 2005 the baseline was found to be reasonably accurate in replicating the main climate effects in the krb the analysis of rainfall water yield and runoff changes in the entire river basin was done at different time scales and an ensemble of six gcms was used because of the huge benefits of depending on the many model outputs liu et al 2012 river et al 2016 daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were generated with swat weather generator based on statistical information swat model was used to simulate rainfall water yield and runoff for kabompo river basin krb which was delineated with an area of 72 078 km2 and sub divided into 102 sub basins with 255 hydrological response units hru swat was then used to simulate three climate scenarios as follows a baseline period with 31 years 1975 2005 and stochastically completed climate data rcp4 5 2020 2050 period with gcms climate change projections to modify baseline data and rcp8 5 2020 2050 period with gcms climate change projections to modify baseline data 2 4 hydrological modelling the gcm output were statistically downscaled to the region and used as input data for hydrological modelling statistical downscaling is mostly used as a conduit for linking gcm outputs with hydrological models due to insignificant computing resources required and can incorporate observations into method it is worth noting that there is uncertainty in modelling impact of climate change on water resources which starts with socio economic story lines future climate scenarios and actual impact modelling murphy and ro 2006 hydrological models therefore provide the means for relating climate changes to water resources by simulating the hydrological processes in river basins the most widely used hydrological model in simulating climate change effect is the soil and water assessment tool swat wang et al 2012 arnold et al 2009 swat is a continuous watershed scale model that simulates major components of the hydrological processes on a daily time step neitsch et al 2005 neitsch et al 2005 the swat model was firstly calibrated with 15 years 1982 1997 monthly flow data and validated with 8 years 1998 2005 monthly flow data the model reached the objective function for nash sutcliff ns of 0 73 at calibration and 0 64 at validation while the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 73 at calibration and 0 70 at validation the model was further subjected to uncertainty analysis with sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 where the p factor was determined to be 0 75 during calibration and 0 73 during validation while the r factor was determined to be 0 75 during calibration and 0 55 during validation and was therefore a very good result to be used for simulation of the gcm outputs in this study land use and land cover were kept constant during swat simulations for future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 therefore climate change was the only factor influencing catchment water balance 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of climate change on catchment water balance the results from six gcm projections that were simulated by swat model showed variations in increased and decreased water balance components in all the months under review for the kabompo basin the variation in water balance components were also in all the seasons except for june july and august jja season where no rainfall was simulated however the increases in rainfall water yield and runoff were larger under rcp8 5 than the rcp4 5 scenarios the highest rainfall increases were simulated by access1 0 under rcp8 5 when compared with the remaining five 5 gcms whilst the same gcm also simulated the lowest rainfall under rcp4 5 amongst the six gcms this could be as a result of different responses of various gcms to the same climate scenarios and therefore creates fundamental uncertainties in climate change projections li and jin 2017 stone et al 2003 the models have various baseline climates when compared and have different sensitivities to changes in emission scenarios carolina et al 2003 the impact model swat was therefore analysed for sensitivity to the two rcps representing the climate change at two various spatial scales that are physically related hydrological model results are summarised for baseline period 1975 2005 rcp4 5 2020 2050 and rcp8 5 2020 2050 future climate scenarios the rainfall water yield and runoff are investigated at monthly seasonal and annual time scales water yield wyld is the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin to contribute to stream flow stone et al 2003 it is calculated by eq no 1 as follows 1 wyld qsurf qgw qlat qloss runoff is the surface runoff simulated by swat model using the soil conservation service scs curve number method mohammad 2016 peak runoff indicates the erosive power of a storm and is many times used in the prediction of loss of sediments rostamian 2010 peak runoff rate is calculated in swat model using the modified rational method chow et al 1988 the six gcm projections were simulated with swat model their mean was calculated and the results are shown in fig 2 as ensemble simulations the swat simulated ensemble and the mean for baseline rainfall and water yield in fig 2 shows minor variations and that the highest rainfall of 200 250 mm occurs in january and december with p ispl cm5a lr simulating the highest rainfall in january exceeding the other five the simulations also show that rainfall for february march and april occurs in a decreasing order before finally ending in may where there is insignificant rainfall fig 2 further shows no simulation for rainfall in june and july but insignificant rainfall is simulated in august and september while for october november and december rainfall is simulated in an increasing order the water yield is a direct response to the rainfall in the basin and swat model simulates the highest water yield in january and december with 55 60 mm from the ensemble gcms the water yield decreases as rainfall reduces but maintains above 15 mm in may to september when there is either no rainfall or negligible the water yield rises again from october to december due to rainfall increase in general the swat simulated rainfall and water yield based on six gcms shows a consensus with insignificant uncertainties the ensemble runoff simulations and their calculated mean were also plotted with ensemble rainfall to further compare between the individual gcms and analyse the impact and uncertainty and the results are shown on fig 3 the swat simulated ensemble and the mean for baseline runoff in fig 3 shows minor variations in the rain season indicating uncertainty and differences in model skill the ensemble runoff is slightly high in january february march november and december when rainfall is also high and tend to decrease with decreasing rainfall occurring in april september and october the model simulates no runoff from may to end of august as must be the case since rainfall is also absent the stream flow is composed of just base flow mainly coming from the water yield runoff also rises from september to december as a direct response to rainfall the runoff simulated from cnrm cm5 output gives the highest runoff of 29 mm in january while ispl cm5a lr output gave the lowest runoff of 12 mm in the same period in order to understand the baseline period better generally swat simulated water yield based on six gcms shows a consensus with insignificant uncertainties and variabilities further comparisons were made between monthly rainfalls actual evapotranspiration et of the swat simulated gcm outputs and the results are shown in fig 4 the swat simulated ensemble and the mean for evapotranspiration et in fig 4 shows no variations and that et ranged from 87 74 mm for january to april which is also the rain season and temperatures are generally low however from april to june there is a sharp decrease due to the transitional period that ends spring season with rainfall in april and begins winter season cold season in june with the lowest temperatures recorded in the year et further decreases to zero or insignificant between june to september before rising gently to 81 mm in december this may be attributed to the rise in temperature the june july and august jja season is characterised with low temperatures as it is the winter season and temperatures begin to rise in september in general the swat simulated et based on six gcms shows a consensus with insignificant uncertainties 3 2 comparisons of gcms ensemble means and observed data the gcm ensemble means were used to compare with observed data for the same historical period for validation the focus was rainfall and temperature data obtained from zambia meteorological department zmd which was observed from five 5 weather stations in the krb for the baseline period 1975 2005 temperature was also plotted on the same graph to show the temporal variability across the basin fig 5 indicates the graphical comparisons of gcm ensemble mean and observed climate variables fig 5 shows a good match between gcm ensemble means for baseline period and observed rainfall for the same period except for october and november where there is a notable mismatch the baseline temperature is slightly over estimated when compared to the observed temperature for maximum minimum and average temperatures this could be attributed to inherent gcm uncertainties and the sparsely located ground weather stations however the baseline was still found to be suitable for determination of change factor for future temperatures because the regime is the same and the differences show some uncertainties coming from the wide coverage of ground observed weather stations and the inherent uncertainties in gcms fig 6 shows the location of the ground weather stations for observed stations the rainfall ensemble mean was further subjected to a trend analysis to determine its suitability for hydrological impact studies a correlation efficiency was determined between the observed and the ensemble mean rainfall data sets the results on fig 7 indicate a correlation efficiency of 96 which confirmed the reliability of the ensemble mean for use in hydrological impact studies the graph in fig 7 shows good correlation efficiency at 96 and therefore gives confidence to use the ensemble mean as a baseline for climate change analysis 3 3 seasonal catchment water balance for baseline ensemble mean the seasons for the krb are defined to be december january and february djf march april and may mam june july and august jja and september october and november son seasonal changes in catchment water balance are useful for planning of agricultural production tourism environmental flow concessions water supply industrial development and hydropower generation the baseline seasonal changes of the catchment water balance were plotted to show variability and fig 8 shows the results fig 8 shows the highest seasonal rainfall of 620 mm and the highest runoff of 58 mm recorded in djf while the highest water yield of 256 mm was recorded in son the season of son receives the second largest rainfall followed by mam and lastly jja when no rain is recorded djf shows the second highest water yield followed by mam and the lowest is recorded in jja son and mam shows the 18 mm and 16 mm runoff respectively while jja has no rainfall and runoff but has considerable water yield this is the baseline flow regime analysed for a period of 31 years 1975 2005 3 4 future changes in catchment water balance under rcp4 5 the gcm ensemble were analysed under the rcp4 5 2020 2050 to detect the change signal and quantify the magnitude of change with respect to catchment water balance components the study focussed on rainfall and water yield with runoff runoff was separated to show its contribution in water yield and its relationship with rainfall different temporal scales were considered under rcp4 5 climate scenario including annual monthly and seasonal across the basin this was done to understand the occurences of the changes with their magnitude 3 4 1 monthly changes fig 9 shows the individual gcm monthly changes in water balance as simulated by swat fig 9 a and f shows a decrease of rainfall in all the months except for january where there is an moderate increase and may which has the highest increase among all gcms in figure a and april in figure f while water yield of both figures show a decrease for all the months the highest decrease in rainfall of more than 50 is shown in may under fig 9 e and the highest runoff of more than 100 is shown in april under the same figure fig 9 d predicts moderate increase in rainfall and water yield in all months except may october and december while fig 9 e c and b indicate moderate decreases and increases of rainfall and water yield the results of gcm ensemble show uncertainty because various gcms responded differently to external forcing formulation of models and the process of downscaling one of the most widely used change factor methodology in climate change impact studies cfm trzaska and schnarr 2014 hamududu 2012 anandhi et al 2011 chen et al 2011 was used to obtain an overview of the change for the entire basin by analysing gcm ensemble mean under rcp4 5 and the baseline ensemble mean the results of the change under rcp4 5 are indicated on fig 10 the gcm ensemble mean in fig 10 indicate a slight increase in monthly rainfall for december january february and march while october and november show a significant decrease the water yield and runoff when compared with a baseline ensemble also show a slight increase the results clearly show that monthly rainfall water yield and runoff has increased in december january february and march while rainfall decreased by 19 and 4 in october and november respectively the highest rainfall increase of 3 is predicted in january followed by 2 in february and december the highest monthly water yield is predicted to be 10 and 8 in march and january respectively and the highest and lowest runoff is predicted to be 13 in december and 50 in october respectively there is a slight increase in water yield between april and september 3 4 2 seasonal changes there are significant variations in water balance components based on seasons which have also affected the catchment water balance fig 11 shows the seasonal changes in rainfall water yield and runoff fig 11 shows that rainfall in djf will increase by 2 across the basin while water yield will increase by 7 and runoff by 11 rainfall and water yield will increase in mam by 1 and 6 respectively while runoff increases by 5 in jja no rainfall and runoff is predicted while water yield is predicted to increase by 2 the son season shows a rainfall decrease of 8 while runoff also decreases by 5 and water yield will slightly increase by 1 this decrease may lead to seasonal drought requiring major interventions in general the figure shows insignificant changes in rainfall while keeping runoff with considerable changes 3 4 3 annual changes the annual changes under rcp4 5 for the next period of 2020 2050 predict that rainfall will decrease by 1 while water yield and runoff will increase by 5 and 6 respectively table 2 show the results of the changes in ensemble mean the results under rcp4 5 predict that runoff in djf will have a considerable increase of 11 while the changes in the rest of the seasons in rainfall and other hydrological variables are generally insignificant throughout the period the annual rainfall show insignificant reduction of 1 and a small increase of 5 in water yield while runoff increased by 6 the annual water balance components show that the rcp4 5 and baseline periods will have insignificant variations 3 4 4 future changes in catchment water balance under rcp8 5 the gcm ensemble was further analysed under the rcp8 5 2020 2050 to detect the change signal and quantify the magnitude of change with respect to water balance components the swat simulations were considered under monthly seasonal and annual time scales across the basin in order to analyse the variability of changes with their magnitude 3 4 5 monthly changes fig 12 shows the monthly changes in water balance for individual gcms as simulated by swat fig 12 a shows the p access1 0 with the highest increase in rainfall water yield and runoff in january february march november and december when compared with the other five gcms the increase in rainfall ranges from 3 to 180 while water yield and runoff it ranges from 83 to 534 and 153 1628 respectively the results show huge differences with the remaining five gcms fig 12 b indicates p cnrm cm5 with a decrease in rainfall water yield and runoff for january and march while showing a moderate increase in the water balance components in february november december and april the largest runoff increase of 416 is predicted in october and the remaining months of may june july august and september have insignificant rainfall water yield with no runoff predictions fig 12 c shows p ipsl cm5a lr with moderate increase in the water balance for january february march and december while october and november shows a decrease the increase in rainfall and runoff ranges from 8 to 50 and 12 80 respectively while water yield ranges from 4 to 31 while predicting the largest decrease in rainfall and runoff in october at 39 and 99 respectively there is a water yield increase of 10 from may to september but without rainfall and runoff perhaps due to a contribution of base flow fig 12 d shows p miroc5 with a similar trend to 3 11 c where there is a moderate increase in water balance for the same months while april and october have a decrease there is also a slight increase in water yield between may to august fig 12 e shows p mpi esm mr with march september october and november to have a decrease of 3 36 in rainfall while january february and april show an increase in rainfall water yield and runoff the figure also shows an increase in water yield and runoff for march november and december while also showing a notable decrease in water yield from may to september fig 12 f shows p mri cgcm3 with a considerable decrease of rainfall in april december november and february in the order of 25 16 13 and 7 the figure also shows that january march september and october have also an increase in rainfall water yield and runoff while may to august have a decrease in water yield and no rainfall and runoff is predicted there are considerable differences in gcm results which can be attributed to uncertainty emanating from external forcing downscaling and modelling processes the results from gcm p access1 0 show significant increase in catchment water balance and far above the remaining five gcms for the future period there are also wide variations in the five gcms and this could be due to uncertainties aforementioned there is therefore no consensus in the six gcm results shown in fig 12 in order to obtain an overview of the change for the entire basin further analysis was performed between the gcm ensemble mean under rcp8 5 and the baseline ensemble mean the results of the change under rcp8 5 are indicated on fig 13 the results in fig 13 clearly show that monthly water balance will significantly increase in november december january february and march rainfall and runoff will increase in the ranges of 9 39 and 31 232 respectively rainfall is expected to decrease in in october september may and april in the range of 1 13 the highest rainfall increase is 39 predicted in february followed by 31 in december and january followed by 27 predicted in march and lastly 9 predicted in november the highest monthly water yield and runoff is predicted to be 106 and 232 in february respectively the lowest decrease in runoff is predicted in april with 27 while may june july august and september are predicted with no runoff but 23 26 increase in water yield 3 4 6 seasonal changes the seasonal water balance varies from season to season the djf season is predicted to have the highest water balance followed by mam then son and lastly jja in that order fig 14 shows the seasonal variability of water balance fig 14 shows a significant increase of runoff in djf at 211 while predicting 174 rise in mam and 105 in son with no runoff in jja the figure also shows 98 increase in water yield for djf followed by 58 in mam 23 in jja and lastly 14 in son the increase in rainfall is predicted to be 36 in djf followed 20 in mam and lastly 5 in son the jja season is predicted with no rain as is the case with the current basin scenario 3 4 7 annual changes the annual changes under rcp8 5 2020 2050 show that the annual water balance will increase in general rainfall will increase by 19 27 and water yield and runoff will increase by 40 and 65 respectively table 3 shows the annual changes the results under rcp8 5 predict a general increase in annual water balance annual rainfall and runoff will increase by 19 and 65 respectively while annual water yield will increase by 40 the general rise in annual water balance may culminate into excessive water availability and high storage of groundwater 3 4 8 analysis of future catchment water balance further analysis was performed to compare catchment water balance under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the results were plotted and shown in fig 15 the comparison of seasonal water balance in fig 15 shows no consensus of the two future climate scenarios the water balance analysed under rcp8 5 is clearly much more than that of the rcp4 5 the seasonal rainfall change under rcp8 5 range from 5 35 while rcp4 5 does not show any significant seasonal changes except for 8 decrease in son the figure also shows that the catchment water balance under rcp4 5 will have insignificant variations with the baseline catchment water balance another analysis was performed to compare and contrast the annual catchment water balance and the results are shown in table 4 table 4 shows that the annual changes in water balance under rcp4 5 are insignificant and therefore unlikely to alter the current water balance the changes under rcp8 5 are significant and most likely will increase the catchment water balance to unprecedented levels nevertheless the scenario under rcp8 5 characterised with high uncertainty due to non consensus of the swat simulated gcm projections results therefore in general the future is predicted with two scenarios which can be summarised as the future catchment water balance without changes from the current status but with increased water demand and the future water balance with significant increase above the current status with excessive surplus 4 conclusion the impact of climate change on catchment water balance based on gcms is different and depends on temporal resolution and the climate scenarios the monthly changes under rcp4 5 indicate a slight increase in monthly rainfall for december january february and march while october and november show a significant decrease the water yield and runoff when compared with a baseline also show a slight increase the results clearly show that monthly rainfall water yield and runoff has increased in december january february and march while rainfall decreased by 19 and 4 in october and november respectively the highest rainfall increase of 3 is predicted in january followed by 2 in february and december the highest monthly water yield is predicted to be 10 and 8 in march and january respectively and the highest and lowest runoff is predicted to be 13 in december and 50 in october respectively there is a slight increase in water yield between april and september the overall changes in monthly water balance are not significant under this scenario the monthly changes under rcp8 5 show that monthly water balance will significantly increase in november december january february and march rainfall and runoff will increase in the ranges of 9 39 and 31 232 respectively rainfall is expected to decrease in in october september may and april in the range of 1 13 the highest rainfall increase is 39 predicted in february followed by 31 in december and january followed by 27 predicted in march and lastly 9 predicted in november the highest monthly water yield and runoff is predicted to be 106 and 232 in february respectively the lowest decrease in runoff is predicted in april with 27 while may june july august and september are predicted with no runoff but 23 26 increase in water yield the seasonal changes under rcp4 5 predicts 11 seasonal runoff increase in djf while the changes in the rest of the seasons in rainfall and water yield is generally insignificant throughout the period the annual rainfall will reduce by 1 while water yield and runoff will increase by 5 and 6 respectively the individual gcm results show insignificant uncertainties and a good consensus the catchment water balance under this scenario will not deviate considerably from the baseline and therefore the major concern would be to enhance management of water resources because of the demand which is likely to double by the end of the 31 year period for municipal water supply environmental industrial agricultural energy sector and mining sector the evaluated impact under this scenario gives a status quo of water resources with the baseline period the seasonal changes under rcp8 5 scenario predicts significant increases in water balance that has a strong likelihood of increasing catchment water balance the seasonal increases of runoff at 211 rainfall at 35 may indicate occurrence of excessive catchment water balance the comparison of seasonal water balance under the two rcps shows no consensus of the future climate scenarios the water balance analysed under rcp8 5 is clearly much more than that of the rcp4 5 the seasonal rainfall change under rcp8 5 range from 5 35 while rcp4 5 does not show any significant seasonal changes except for 8 decrease in son the catchment water balance under rcp4 5 will have insignificant variations with the baseline catchment water balance annual statistics under rcp8 5 show a significant increase of 65 40 and 19 in runoff water yield and rainfall respectively while under rcp4 5 there is an annual reduction in rainfall of 1 and an increase in runoff and water yield of 6 and 5 respectively generally rcp8 5 climate scenario shows high uncertainties of gcms simulations than rcp4 5 climate scenario in the krb the variability of individual gcms is also wide and shows no good consensus under rcp8 5 as compared with rcp4 5 results the six gcms have demonstrated a rare skill in modelling climate change for krb there is significant increase under rcp8 5 in catchment water balance at monthly seasonal and annual time scales the prediction may call for preparedness in disaster mitigation and adaptation review of policies review of designs of hydraulic structures flood mapping and awareness campaign meanwhile under rcp4 5 the evaluated catchment water balance at monthly seasonal and annual time scales may also call for integrated water resources management of available water resources against a growing water demand in the krb further research will be required for evaluation of the impact of climate change on streamflow water quality flood mapping of flood prone areas and rainfall intensity in order to

although rainfall amounts and rates were similar between simulations and natural rainfall differences in interception value may still exist between simulated and natural conditions due to the formation size distribution and movement of water droplets emitted from simulation systems vs natural rainfall water droplets throughfall and interception significantly correlated with lai and height

significant part of their livelihood gheysari et al 2017 the main limitation of maize growth in iran is drought khalili et al 2011 and maize yield can be diminished as a consequence of insufficient water supply to meet crop water demand crop canopies impact the terrestrial hydrological cycle by modifying the distribution of water applied during irrigation or rainfall this water is partitioned into three components as it passes through the crop canopy throughfall pt stemflow ps and rainfall interception i pt is water that passes directly or indirectly through the plant canopy to the soil surface ps is water that flows from the leaves to the stem and then down the stem to the soil surface therefore the actual magnitude of rainfall or sprinkler irrigation that reaches the soil surface pt ps is net rainfall pnet i is the portion of rain or sprinkler irrigation that is stored on plant surfaces or evaporated during transit through the canopy understanding canopy water partitioning is vital to agricultural operations as it is directly tied to plant growth regulation via for example effective and low cost fertilizer application myers et al 1970 moreover canopy water partitioning can play a role in the deposition of pollutants on crops huber and gillespie 1992 in the liberation and dispersal of fungal inoculums fitt et al 1989 and in soil erosion bui and box 1992 these processes clearly influence irrigation management seginer 1967 mcnaughton 1981 steiner et al 1983 because of the non uniform infiltration caused by redistribution of rainfall and irrigation water under crop

been no research on this topic to date in iran hence the aims of this study were to 1 quantify canopy water partitioning of maize in arid regions of iran over a two year study period 2 evaluate the effect of maize canopy structure on pt ps and i and 3 develop an analytical rainfall partitioning model based on controlled rainfall simulations e g fan et al 2008 and evaluate it against natural i e uncontrolled rainfall conditions our final objective is to our knowledge unique to most previous maize studies as their application of rainfall partitioning models have not used controlled rain experiments rather they use field data from intense irrigation rates or from natural storms 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and measurement of plant characteristics the study plots were situated in the city of varamin located about 35 km southwest of tehran capital of iran in the tehran province of iran 51 38 e 35 17ʹ n 910 m fig 1 a this study occurred from may to september in 2015 and 2016 the experimental site is in an arid climate zone with a mean annual temperature of 18 1 c annual precipitation of 165 mm and a mean annual pan evaporation of approximately 1950 mm the de martonne climate classification categorized the study site as an arid climate type de martonne aridity index 5 9 soils in the experimental site are loam 0 30 cm depth and silt loam 30 60 cm depth the maize variety was cv ksc704 a widely used variety in arid iran tabatabaei et al 2015 and was seeded in wide rows with a row spacing of 60 cm and plant spacing of 30 cm fig 1b plant height and leaf area index lai for each plant were measured after each simulated and natural rainfall event accupar lp 80 ceptometer was used for estimating the lai during the experimental period plant height ranged 53 244 cm and the lai ranged 0 62 4 18 there were 27 rainfall events 17 and 10 storms in 2015 and 2016 respectively maize was planted in late march and were not harvested in either year 2 2 rainfall simulation the simulator included two spray nozzles fig 1c a regulator valve was deployed in a sub pipe that connects a nozzle group and the main pipe in the main pipe a regulated pressure valve was deployed to control the system pressure which could be read by a pressure gauge deployed on the main pipe the main pipe was connected to a pump which was placed in a tank with a 20 m3 water capacity the area controlled by this rainfall simulator measured 2 5 m in length and 2 m in width the distance between nuzzles was 3 m the height of this simulator was adjustable and it was maintained approximately 50 cm above the crop canopy throughout the experiment the rainfall simulator was programmed to produce rainfall intensities from 1 to 11 mm h 1 values which equal the range of intensities reported by past meteorological data in this region during 1 2 h according to the standard irrigation period in this region with water there were 43 simulation events 26 and 17 in 2015 and 2016 respectively 2 3 rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements measurements of pt and ps were done using the same site plants and gauges for simulated and natural rainfall events pg pg magnitude was measured with two rain gauges that were 9 cm in diameter and 22 cm in height and was placed in an adjacent open field as close as possible about 8 m to the experimental field water in the rain gauge was measured manually using a graduated cylinder to an accuracy of 1 mm pt was measured using 15 rectangular plexiglass collectors 50 cm long by 20 cm wide by 20 cm depth randomly installed parallel to the rows under maize canopy distance from the maize stalks and the edge of the gauges between rows was random to overcome the great spatial variability of pt under maize canopy zheng et al 2019 10 of the pt collectors were relocated every five rainfall events the other remained fixed in their positions during study period for each rainfall event 15 plants were selected for ps measurement in this study 15 manual rain gauges were used to collect and measure the volume of the ps collected from 15 representative plants the ps collector was made from the flexible yet resistant material from a baby bottle nipple and adjusted to small changes in the stem diameter the ps depth was derived using the following equation zheng et al 2018 1 ps vs a where ps is the stemflow depth mm vs is the stemflow volume l and a is the average ground area occupied by a maize plant 60 cm 30 cm ps gauges were shielded from other sources of rain by fastening a prismatic plastic container that faced downward and had an opening to allow the passage of the ps tubing observed maize canopy i mm for each event was derived from the water balance 2 i pg pt ps 2 4 model description and evaluation the most commonly applied analytical model of rainfall partitioning is the revised gash analytical model rgam gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 muzylo et al 2009 the rgam requires the following parameters be determined canopy saturation point p g canopy storage capacity s free throughfall coefficient p mean of the ratio of evaporation e rate to the mean of rainfall intensity r during saturated canopy conditions e r stem saturation point p g stem storage capacity st and stem partitioning coefficient pt p g is given by the following equation 3 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r where r mm h 1 is the mean rainfall rate falling on a saturated canopy and can be obtained from the measured rainfall intensities e c is the mean evaporation rate from a saturated canopy scaled in proportion to canopy cover c and was determined via gash 1979 method 4 e a r where a is the slope of a linear regression of i mm vs pg mm in saturated canopy in this study s was defined as the minimum amount of pg retained in the canopy and was estimated using the mean method klaassen et al 1998 which is commonly used by other scientists see review by friesen et al 2015 and sc is the s per unit area of canopy cover c was computed as 1 p gash et al 1995 a slope of pt against pg for storms lower than p g is equal p p g is calculated with the following equation 5 p g s t p t where st and pt are estimates of the negative intercept and slope respectively of the linear regression of ps mm against pg mm gash and morton 1978 finally i in rgam are calculated using the following equation valente et al 1997 6 j

is the number of events that saturate the stem storage capacity stc is the stem storage capacity per unit area of canopy cover and ptc is the incident pg reaching the stems as maize canopy is dynamic throughout a growing season rgam parameters with growth stage were calculated table 1 hence we parameterized the rgam using 43 simulated rainfall events ssss to evaluate the performance of the rgam

kolmogorov smirnov test for relationships between pt ps and relating storm size and intensity lai and plant height aston 1979 curve was used 11 y a 1 e x b where a is the maximum percent of pt or ps b is the pt or ps response rate after the amount of variable i e rain magnitude rain intensity lai and plant height at which pt or ps starts for relationships between i and above mentioned variables the following equation was used 12 y a x b c where c is the mean from high magnitude events in addition to the use of aston relationships we used single variable regressions between rainfall partitioning and above mentioned variables the unpaired t test at the 95 confidence interval p 0 05 was employed to compare the rainwater partitioning all statistical analyses were performed in spss ver 24 and r ver 3 0 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of natural and simulated rainfall total rainfall for all 27 natural and 43 simulated events was 125 9 mm and 200 5 mm respectively measured event characteristics were similar across natural and simulated rainfall storm magnitude ranged 1 1 10 2 mm natural storms and 1 3 10 8 mm simulated storms and averaged 4 7 mm for both event duration varied from 0 1 to 3 4 h for natural rainfall and 1 0 1 9 h for simulated rainfall despite these differences in duration the intensity of natural and simulated events were similar ranging 0 3 11 5 mm h 1 and 1 2 10 6 mm h 1 respectively with an average of 3 7 mm h 1 for both these real and simulated rainfall conditions are representative of what is typically experienced across the study area irimo islamic republic of iran meteorological organization 2017 3 2 rainwater partitioning under natural and simulated conditions the respective cumulative percentages from natural rain storms were 58 1 22 0 and 19

rainfall partitioning response to rainfall amount fig 2 and intensity fig 3 was similar between natural and simulated rainfalls relative pt and ps positively increased with storm size figs 2a b and intensity for pt fig 3a to a maximum value which is a commonly reported trend often attributed to the saturation of canopy flow pathways crockford and richardson 2000 saturation of canopy flow pathways has also been linked to observations of relative i diminishing with increasing storm size and intensity until reaching a steady minimum value as was observed in this study figs 2c 3c although rainfall amounts and rates were similar between simulations and natural rainfall see previous section differences may still exist between simulated and natural conditions due to the formation size distribution and movement of water droplets emitted from simulation systems vs natural rainfall water droplets dunkerley 2008 overall despite possible differences in rainfall droplet properties between simulations and natural events rainfall partitioning was generally similar across conditions for this study figs 2 3 3 3 rainwater partitioning in relation to maize canopy structure rainwater partitioning under both conditions remained relatively steady when lai of the maize canopy in this study was 2 5 yielding relative pt ps and i that were approximately 65 70 20 25 and 10 15 respectively fig 4 above an lai threshold around 2 5 3 1 partitioning of rainwater correlated strongly with lai in different directions depending on the partition fig 4 inverse relationships were observed for relative pt when lai 2 5 fig 4a yet relative i directly correlated with lai 2 7 3 1 fig 4c the effect of increasing lai on diminishing relative pt and increasing relative i was greater for natural rainfall than for the simulated events fig 4a c perhaps lai above the observed threshold point 2 5 reaches a tipping point in canopy surface area capable of holding water and likely increasing relative i and decreasing relative pt ps varied markedly at higher lais 2 5 but did not produce any significant trends with lai fig 4b although we did not find a significant relationship between ps and lai positive relationships have been reported for banana plants cattan et al 2007 and sorghum bui and box 1992 rainwater partitioning under both conditions also varied in response to plant height fig 5 relative i and pt stayed relatively constant when maize height was 180 cm resulting in relative pt ps and i of approximately 75 15 and 10 fig 5 at plant heights 180 cm relative pt and i correlated robustly with plant height in opposite directions fig 5a c for natural rainfall this height threshold was less apparent figs 5a c previous work on maize has reported a threshold plant height where after relative i increased and pt decreased sun et al 2017 this may be explained by the increased length of interaction between the rainwater and canopy surfaces resulting in greater retention and evaporation after flowering maize leaf arrangement changes i e leaf angle increases and the upper half of leaves bend toward the soil surface simultaneously necrosis may result in the death of lower leaves of plants which likely influence the proportion of water dripping from leaves brant et al 2017 ps also varied markedly at higher plant height 180 cm during simulated rainfall treatment fig 5b a finding previously observed parkin and codling 1990 3 4 modelling of maize rainfall partitioning rgam parameters varied with growth stage table 1 canopy p g and stem p g saturation points across the entire season were found to be 1 90 and 2 96 mm respectively canopy storage capacity s was 0 85 mm and stem storage capacity st was 0 13 mm the direct throughfall coefficient p and stemflow partitioning coefficient pt were estimated to be 0 61 and 0 39 respectively the mean of the ratio of evaporation e rate to the mean of rainfall intensity r during saturated canopy conditions e r was found to be 0 17 and e value was 0 62 mm fitted rgam data relying on simulated rainfall corresponded well with observed data fig 6 and regressions between predicted and observed i was strongly significant across the entire season p values 0 039 on a per storm analysis the difference between fitted rgam model and measured values ranged from 0 004 mm model underestimate for the tasseling stage to 0 64 mm model overestimate for the maturity stage for the natural rainfall conditions fig 6 on rain storms size analysis for natural rainfall the difference between fitted rgam and measured values averaged 0 12 mm model underestimate 0 19 mm model overestimate 0 04 mm model overestimate 0 38 mm model overestimate and 0 10 mm model overestimate for the seedling jointing tasseling maturity and overall stages respectively fig 6 rgam performance for the tasseling stages was better than other stage table 2 according to the ce and ia evaluation model metrics the overall performance of the model fit was good for the tasseling stage ce 0 56 ia 0 86 and entire season ce 0 08 ia 0 63 table 2 also the nmpe of fitted model for the corresponding stages were found to be 4 95 and 14 90 respectively table 2 4 conclusion rainfall or irrigation interception by crops and residues has often been overlooked in hydrologic modelling however our results confirm that interception by maize canopy can significantly reduce total water input to the surface and redistribute significant portions of rainwater to their stem bases 22 0 of cumulative rainfall became stemflow maize canopy structure lai and plant height also differentially interacted with rainfall conditions to influence rainwater interception and redistribution to the surface very few rainfall partitioning studies train analytical models using observations of throughfall and stemflow from controlled simulated rainfall experiments like done in this study our simulated rainfall experiments resulted in models that accurately predicted maize canopy rainfall partitioning under natural conditions regionally this is the first quantitative study of rainfall partitioning for maize fields in iran on which future research may rely for assessing the environmental impacts of semiarid agriculture such as chemical leaching and agricultural management irrigation planning the meteorological conditions examined in this study were limited to rain amount and intensity however other variables are known to influence patterns of throughfall and stemflow and merit future investigation including wind conditions and

and bruijnzeel 2001b li et al 2003 wang et al 2006 liu et al 2015 zheng et al 2018a b zheng et al 2019 these ranges of pt ps and i are large and vary across region however to our knowledge there has been no research on this topic to date in iran hence the aims of this study were to 1 quantify canopy water partitioning of maize in arid regions of iran over a two year study period 2 evaluate the effect of maize canopy structure on pt ps and i and 3 develop an analytical rainfall partitioning model based on controlled rainfall simulations e g fan et al 2008 and evaluate it against natural i e uncontrolled rainfall conditions our final objective is to our knowledge unique to most previous maize studies as their application of rainfall partitioning models have not used controlled rain experiments rather they use field data from intense irrigation rates or from natural storms 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and measurement of plant characteristics the study plots were situated in the city of varamin located about 35 km southwest of tehran capital of iran in the tehran province of iran 51 38 e 35 17ʹ n 910 m fig 1 a this study occurred from may to september in 2015 and 2016 the experimental site is in an arid climate zone with a mean annual temperature of 18 1 c annual precipitation of 165 mm and a mean annual pan evaporation of approximately 1950 mm the de martonne climate classification categorized the study site as an arid climate type de martonne aridity index 5 9 soils in the experimental site are loam 0 30 cm depth and silt loam 30 60 cm depth the maize variety was cv ksc704 a widely used variety in arid iran tabatabaei et al 2015 and was seeded in wide rows with a row spacing of 60 cm and plant spacing of 30 cm fig 1b plant height and leaf area index lai for each plant were measured after each simulated and natural rainfall event accupar lp 80 ceptometer was used for estimating the lai during the experimental period plant height ranged 53 244 cm and the lai ranged 0 62 4 18 there were 27 rainfall events 17 and 10 storms in 2015 and 2016 respectively maize was planted in late march and were not harvested in either year 2 2 rainfall simulation the simulator included two spray nozzles fig 1c a regulator valve was deployed in a sub pipe that connects a nozzle group and the main pipe in the main pipe a regulated pressure valve was deployed to control the system pressure which could be read by a pressure gauge deployed on the main pipe the main pipe was connected to a pump which was placed in a tank with a 20 m3 water capacity the area controlled by this rainfall simulator measured 2 5 m in length and 2 m in width the distance between nuzzles was 3 m the height of this simulator was adjustable and it was maintained approximately 50 cm above the crop canopy throughout the experiment the rainfall simulator was programmed to produce rainfall intensities from 1 to 11 mm h 1 values which equal the range of intensities reported by past meteorological data in this region during 1 2 h according to the standard irrigation period in this region with water there were 43 simulation events 26 and 17 in 2015 and 2016 respectively 2 3 rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements measurements of pt and ps were done using the same site plants and gauges for simulated and natural rainfall events pg pg magnitude was measured with two rain gauges that were 9 cm in diameter and 22 cm in height and was placed in an adjacent open field as close as possible about 8 m to the experimental field water in the rain gauge was measured manually using a graduated cylinder to an accuracy of 1 mm pt was measured using 15 rectangular plexiglass collectors 50 cm long by 20 cm wide by 20 cm depth randomly installed parallel to the rows under maize canopy distance from the maize stalks and the edge of the gauges between rows was random to overcome the great spatial variability of pt under maize canopy zheng et al 2019 10 of the pt collectors were relocated every five rainfall events the other remained fixed in their positions during study period for each rainfall event 15 plants were selected for ps measurement in this study 15 manual rain gauges were used to collect and measure the volume of the ps collected from 15 representative plants the ps collector was made from the flexible yet resistant material from a baby bottle nipple and adjusted to small changes in the stem diameter the ps depth was derived using the following equation zheng et al 2018 1 ps vs a where ps is the stemflow depth mm vs is the stemflow volume l and a is the average ground area occupied by a maize plant 60 cm 30 cm ps gauges were shielded from other sources of rain by fastening a prismatic plastic container that faced downward and had an opening to allow the passage of the ps tubing observed maize canopy i mm for each event was derived from the water balance 2 i pg pt ps 2 4 model description and evaluation the most commonly applied analytical model of rainfall partitioning is the revised gash analytical model rgam gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 muzylo et al 2009 the rgam requires the following parameters be determined canopy saturation point p g canopy storage capacity s free throughfall coefficient p mean of the ratio of evaporation e rate to the mean of rainfall intensity r during saturated canopy conditions e r stem saturation point p g stem storage capacity st and stem partitioning coefficient pt p g is given by the following equation 3 p g r e c s c ln 1 e c r where r mm h 1 is the mean rainfall rate falling on a saturated canopy and can be obtained from the measured rainfall intensities e c is the mean evaporation rate from a saturated canopy scaled in proportion to canopy cover c and was determined via gash 1979 method 4 e a r where a is the slope of a linear regression of i mm vs pg mm in saturated canopy in this study s was defined as the minimum amount of pg retained in the canopy and was estimated using the mean method klaassen et al 1998 which is commonly used by other scientists see review by friesen et al 2015 and sc is the s per unit area of canopy cover c was computed as 1 p gash et al 1995 a slope of pt against pg for storms lower than p g is equal p p g is calculated with the following equation 5 p g s t p t where st and pt are estimates of the negative intercept and slope respectively of the linear regression of ps mm against pg mm gash and morton 1978 finally i in rgam are calculated using the following equation valente et al 1997 6 j

is the number of events that saturate the stem storage capacity stc is the stem storage capacity per unit area of canopy cover and ptc is the incident pg reaching the stems as maize canopy is dynamic throughout a growing season rgam parameters with growth stage were calculated table 1 hence we parameterized the rgam using 43 simulated rainfall events ssss to evaluate the performance of the rgam

kolmogorov smirnov test for relationships between pt ps and relating storm size and intensity lai and plant height aston 1979 curve was used 11 y a 1 e x b where a is the maximum percent of pt or ps b is the pt or ps response rate after the amount of variable i e rain magnitude rain intensity lai and plant height at which pt or ps starts for relationships between i and above mentioned variables the following equation was used 12 y a x b c where c is the mean from high magnitude events in addition to the use of aston relationships we used single variable regressions between rainfall partitioning and above mentioned variables the unpaired t test at the 95 confidence interval p 0 05 was employed to compare the rainwater partitioning all statistical analyses were performed in spss ver 24 and r ver 3 0 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of natural and simulated rainfall total rainfall for all 27 natural and 43 simulated events was 125 9 mm and 200 5 mm respectively measured event characteristics were similar across natural and simulated rainfall storm magnitude ranged 1 1 10 2 mm natural storms and 1 3 10 8 mm simulated storms and averaged 4 7 mm for both event duration varied from 0 1 to 3 4 h for natural rainfall and 1 0 1 9 h for simulated rainfall despite these differences in duration the intensity of natural and simulated events were similar ranging 0 3 11 5 mm h 1 and 1 2 10 6 mm h 1 respectively with an average of 3 7 mm h 1 for both these real and simulated rainfall conditions are representative of what is typically experienced across the study area irimo islamic republic of iran meteorological organization 2017 3 2 rainwater partitioning under natural and simulated conditions the respective cumulative percentages from natural rain storms were 58 1 22 0 and 19

rainfall partitioning response to rainfall amount fig 2 and intensity fig 3 was similar between natural and simulated rainfalls relative pt and ps positively increased with storm size figs 2a b and intensity for pt fig 3a to a maximum value which is a commonly reported trend often attributed to the saturation of canopy flow pathways crockford and richardson 2000 saturation of canopy flow pathways has also been linked to observations of relative i diminishing with increasing storm size and intensity until reaching a steady minimum value as was observed in this study figs 2c 3c although rainfall amounts and rates were similar between simulations and natural rainfall see previous section differences may still exist between simulated and natural conditions due to the formation size distribution and movement of water droplets emitted from simulation systems vs natural rainfall water droplets dunkerley 2008 overall despite possible differences in rainfall droplet properties between simulations and natural events rainfall partitioning was generally similar across conditions for this study figs 2 3 3 3 rainwater partitioning in relation to maize canopy structure rainwater partitioning under both conditions remained relatively steady when lai of the maize canopy in this study was 2 5 yielding relative pt ps and i that were approximately 65 70 20 25 and 10 15 respectively fig 4 above an lai threshold around 2 5 3 1 partitioning of rainwater correlated strongly with lai in different directions depending on the partition fig 4 inverse relationships were observed for relative pt when lai 2 5 fig 4a yet relative i directly correlated with lai 2 7 3 1 fig 4c the effect of increasing lai on diminishing relative pt and increasing relative i was greater for natural rainfall than for the simulated events fig 4a c perhaps lai above the observed threshold point 2 5 reaches a tipping point in canopy surface area capable of holding water and likely increasing relative i and decreasing relative pt ps varied markedly at higher lais 2 5 but did not produce any significant trends with lai fig 4b although we did not find a significant relationship between ps and lai positive relationships have been reported for banana plants cattan et al 2007 and sorghum bui and box 1992 rainwater partitioning under both conditions also varied in response to plant height fig 5 relative i and pt stayed relatively constant when maize height was 180 cm resulting in relative pt ps and i of approximately 75 15 and 10 fig 5 at plant heights 180 cm relative pt and i correlated robustly with plant height in opposite directions fig 5a c for natural rainfall this height threshold was less apparent figs 5a c previous work on maize has reported a threshold plant height where after relative i increased and pt decreased sun et al 2017 this may be explained by the increased length of interaction between the rainwater and canopy surfaces resulting in greater retention and evaporation after flowering maize leaf arrangement changes i e leaf angle increases and the upper half of leaves bend toward the soil surface simultaneously necrosis may result in the death of lower leaves of plants which likely influence the proportion of water dripping from leaves brant et al 2017 ps also varied markedly at higher plant height 180 cm during simulated rainfall treatment fig 5b a finding previously observed parkin and codling 1990 3 4 modelling of maize rainfall partitioning rgam parameters varied with growth stage table 1 canopy p g and stem p g saturation points across the entire season were found to be 1 90 and 2 96 mm respectively canopy storage capacity s was 0 85 mm and stem storage capacity st was 0 13 mm the direct throughfall coefficient p and stemflow partitioning coefficient pt were estimated to be 0 61 and 0 39 respectively the mean of the ratio of evaporation e rate to the mean of rainfall intensity r during saturated canopy conditions e r was found to be 0 17 and e value was 0 62 mm fitted rgam data relying on simulated rainfall corresponded well with observed data fig 6 and regressions between predicted and observed i was strongly significant across the entire season p values 0 039 on a per storm analysis the difference between fitted rgam model and measured values ranged from 0 004 mm model underestimate for the tasseling stage to 0 64 mm model overestimate for the maturity stage for the natural rainfall conditions fig 6 on rain storms size analysis for natural rainfall the difference between fitted rgam and measured values averaged 0 12 mm model underestimate 0 19 mm model overestimate 0 04 mm model overestimate 0 38 mm model overestimate and 0 10 mm model overestimate for the seedling jointing tasseling maturity and overall stages respectively fig 6 rgam performance for the tasseling stages was better than other stage table 2 according to the ce and ia evaluation model metrics the overall performance of the model fit was good for the tasseling stage ce 0 56 ia 0 86 and entire season ce 0 08 ia 0 63 table 2 also the nmpe of fitted model for the corresponding stages were found to be 4 95 and 14 90 respectively table 2 4 conclusion rainfall or irrigation interception by crops and residues has often been overlooked in hydrologic modelling however our results confirm that interception by maize canopy can significantly reduce total water input to the surface and redistribute significant portions of rainwater to their stem bases 22 0 of cumulative rainfall became stemflow maize canopy structure lai and plant height also differentially interacted with rainfall conditions to influence rainwater interception and redistribution to the surface very few rainfall partitioning studies train analytical models using observations of throughfall and stemflow from controlled simulated rainfall experiments like done in this study our simulated rainfall experiments resulted in models that accurately predicted maize canopy rainfall partitioning under natural conditions regionally this is the first quantitative study of rainfall partitioning for maize fields in iran on which future research may rely for assessing the environmental impacts of semiarid agriculture such as chemical leaching and agricultural management irrigation planning the meteorological conditions examined in this study were limited to rain amount and intensity however other variables are known to influence patterns of throughfall and stemflow and merit future investigation including wind conditions and

seasonal and monthly periods were assessed new hydrological insights for the region the results show that future annual water yield could change by 46 48 44 and 35 under the regional sub regional local and ensemble mean of the climate scenarios respectively seasonal water yield from the ensemble mean of the future climate scenario was projected to decrease between 2 16 mm with a mean decrease of 33 39 during the december february season there was no directional effect of spatial resolution on water yield the future period could be impacted by both drought and flood we recommend that re afforestation should be encouraged to improve infiltration and reduce deforestation which was 2 27 per annum in the assessed period to prevent flood causing runoffs while irrigation technology will help to improve resilience to drought keywords climate change invest model land use land cover change pra river basin regional climate models sdsm dc water yield 1 introduction sustainability of water resources has become a global debate in this era of climate change globally accessible freshwater resources are less than 1 of the global water stock and its uneven spatial and temporal distribution along with overexploitation of water resources for human activities which often causes water scarcity savenije 2000 hoekstra and mekonnen 2011 anthropogenic degradation of watersheds is one of the main direct causes of freshwater scarcity murphy and kapelle 2014 water sustainability depends on ecosystem structure and function in a watershed and a current challenge due to unplanned use resulting from population and economic growth changes in land use and global dynamics it is further threatened by climate change at the global regional and local scale enanga et al 2011 boon and ahenkan 2012 bangash et al 2013 niang et al 2014 ipcc 2014 world bank group 2016 the negative consequences associated with this situation are amplified during the dry season when water resources can usually be insufficient to meet both human and riverine ecosystem needs jujnovsky et al 2010 about 48 of the world s population in 2025 is projected to live in basins that are water stressed bangash et al 2013 a rising world population is forecast to be 9 7 billion people by 2050 and sub saharan africa which is projected to double by that period could subsequently cause major changes in lifestyle especially in terms of spending and food choices un desa 2019 water will be a major resource required to increase food production approximately 70 to meet global food needs in 2050 steduto et al 2012 a potential constraint to food production is the threat of water scarcity steduto et al 2012 davis et al 2015 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 projected 10 30 reduction in water availability by 2050 over some dry regions at mid latitudes and in the dry tropics this is particularly concerning as some of these locations are currently water stressed in ethiopia climate change accounted for 70 changes in water resources in comparison with land use change abera et al 2019 floods and droughts are the notable extreme impacts of climate change evidenced mostly in sub saharan africa causing significant economic losses due to the low resilience capacity of the region resulting from high poverty and political instability unep 2002 bo et al 2004 fao 2009 davis et al 2015 research conducted by the water footprint network 2018 showed that ghana annually faces blue water amount of surface or ground water used for the production of a good or service scarcity during the dry seasons november february studies show that climate change is expected to further worsen this situation as it may result in erratic rainfall in the tropics which would alter the trend of runoff and river flows milly et al 2005 ipcc 2007 lópez moreno et al 2011 the trend of change in water availability is inconsistent in ghana under different climate models kasei 2009 obuobie et al 2012 nutsukpo et al 2013 amisigo et al 2015 the pra river basin the leading tuber crop production zone of ghana and a major producer of cocoa an economic crop in ghana has been found to be water stressed and projected to undergo water scarcity 681 m3 per capita per year and absolute scarcity 306 m3 per capita per year in 2020 and 2050 respectively obuobie et al 2012 these findings as well as regional and global projections of climate change could negatively impact on food security and the economy of ghana this situation would be critical for the inhabitants of ghana s pra river basin who depend majorly on agriculture for their livelihood and are already facing challenges due to unsustainable management of its watersheds because of intensified human activities wrc 2012 murphy and kapelle 2014 duncan et al 2019 amisigo et al 2015 projected both positive and negative change in runoff in the pra river basin for the period 2011 2050 whereas obuobie et al 2012 projected only negative change for streamflow in the same basin from 2006 2065 according to awotwi et al 2019 settlement and mining land use classes showed a strong positive correlation with water yield while cropland showed a weak correlation therefore land use expansion into forest reduces the service of vegetation in regulating the amount of water yield the pra river basin is one of the most extensively and intensively used river basins in ghana in terms of settlements agriculture logging and mining particularly because of its valuable tree species mineral ore deposits and suitable environment for farming therefore the wide variations in water availability due to climate and anthropogenic activities may have severe local impacts and hence further assessment with high resolution models and a combination of varied resolutions models is needed moreover quantifying the distribution of water resources at the basin level under both climate and land use change scenarios can help identify vulnerable locations for adequate adaptation planning and implementation the current challenges in such assessment are the high data requirement pre processing of data and time and training efforts required by traditional hydrological models in achieving the desired goals with broader spatial representation of results to support decision making process vogl et al 2016 luke and hack 2018 furthermore models that can support hydrological ecosystem service hes decisions should be conceptualized to account for changes in land use at the parcel level guswa et al 2014 which is not adequately represented in traditional hydrological models adopting the integrated valuation of ecosystem service and trade offs invest model with its minimal application efforts and data requirements makes it suitable and capable of serving areas with scarce data like sub saharan africa and the pra river basin in particular volk 2014 ibrahim et al 2015 komi et al 2017 the spatially explicit nature and quick scenario generation of large geographical areas using invest could facilitate the decision making process protect degrading water resources by highlighting hotspots that would require urgent land management interventions and improve monitoring of hydrological ecosystem services in the long term at reduced cost dimobe et al 2015 vogl et al 2016 luke and hack 2018 sharp et al 2018 these strengths make the tool attractive to use as opposed to some of the complex hydrological models such as swat soil and water assessment tool fiesta fog interception for the enhancement of streamflow in tropical areas and aries artificial intelligence for ecosystem services according to ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 invest was among the most commonly used tools implemented for spatial modelling of hes the aim of this study was to therefore assess the variations in the impacts of future regional and local climate simulations and land use change on water yields using a hydrological ecosystem service tool in order to inform water resources management policies in the pra river basin of ghana the following questions were investigated what was the change in annual water yield based on 1986 2002 and 2018 lulc what is the expected degree of change in annual water yield under regional and local climate scale scenarios for the future period 2020 2049 what could be the future variations in seasonal water yield in the basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the pra river basin has the highest density of settlements with over 1300 towns in ghana and covers an area of 23 330 70 km2 between latitudes 4 58ꞌ n and 7 11ꞌ n and longitudes 0 25ꞌ w and 2 13ꞌ w wrc 2012 the pra river basin is underlain majorly by soil with moderately high runoff potential ross et al 2018 and lies at an elevation range between 10 m and 848 m fig 1 a this makes the low areas of the basin vulnerable to water disasters during extremes rainfall events the mean annual values of rainfall minimum and maximum temperatures for the period 1981 2010 were 1446 mm 21 74 c and 31 6 c respectively bessah et al 2018 2019 the climatic conditions in the basin promote rapid vegetative growth and are conducive for farming fig 1b especially during the rainy seasons furthermore both large and small scale mining activities take place in the basin thereby creating some intense land use change dynamics this has resulted in land use competition between farmers and miners especially cocoa farmers and small scale illegal miners locally known as galamsey dickson and benneh 1995 coniwas 2011 kusimi et al 2015 moreover water demand for activities in the basin is critical since a population from about 1300 towns in 41 districts in ghana depends on the basin for their water supply that is an estimated population of 5 9 million people in the basin based on a growth rate of 2 2 according to the 2000 census wrc 2012 kusimi et al 2015 findings from the ipcc fifth assessment report s 43 global circulation models gcms projected temperature to increase in the range of 1 2 c 5 1 c and rainfall to decrease in the range of 0 88 1 66 in the 21st century in the pra river basin ipcc 2014 bessah et al 2018 2019 however gcms at coarse spatial resolution does not provide some of the vital components of the regional and local climate which contribute maximally to the changes observed at a basin level wilby and wigley 1997 wilby et al 2014 this implies that higher spatial resolution climate models either single or combined are needed to assess the changes in climate and its impact on water resources to guide the planning of appropriate adaptation measures for the basin s inhabitants 2 2 hydrological ecosystem service modelling using invest the hes modelled in this study was water yield which falls under the provisional category of hes the invest seasonal water yield model provides guidance regarding the contribution of land parcels to the generation of both baseflow and quick flow the baseflow is defined as the generation of streamflow with watershed residence times of months to years while quick flow represents the generation of streamflow with watershed residence times of hours to days sharp et al 2018 the model computes spatial indices that quantify the relative contribution of a parcel of land to the generation of both baseflow and quick flow the first approach of the model emphasises the land use and land cover lulc of a site since the focus is on net generation from the pixel or parcel of land while the second approach represents the actual streamflow generated by a pixel since actual streamflow cannot be less than zero this approach unlike the first result in indices that are greater than or equal to zero the current version of invest seasonal water yield model used in this study does not estimate quantitative baseflow but only the relative contributions per pixels this is a limitation that developers are working on to address in a separate tool in the next version of the invest model sharp et al 2018 it is worth stating that the water yield from the invest model provides averages and not the extremes and neglects the interactions between groundwater surface and deep in its estimations the model was set up by pre processing the datasets into the same pixel size in a gis environment before using them in the invest model a combination of raster vector and csv data are required with specific naming guidelines for data files the data used as inputs to the model are presented in table s1 in the supplementary material all raster datasets were resampled to a 30 m spatial resolution in arcgis 10 3 the resampling was done to maintain consistency with the resolution of the lulc and dem furthermore raster input datasets of invest model are required to have the same spatial resolution lulc maps of 1986 2002 and 2018 generated from landsat images for the study area were used fig s1 in the supplementary material the random forest algorithm for supervised classification was employed in r software in combination with qgis for the lulc maps generation and change detection analysis the invest model was not tested for readjustment due to the lack of observed water yield records in the study area from the land use analysis forest and open vegetation were reported to approximately decrease by 20 and 3 between 1986 and 2002 while from 2002 2018 there was an approximate decrease of 36 and 1 respectively settlement and arable bare lands increased in both periods 1986 2002 and 2002 2018 water bodies including all open water such as lakes rivers and temporarily stored surface water increased by about 300 in the first period and decreased by 75 in the second period figure s1 the west african drought in 1983 was a major reason for the reduced water quantity in the 1986 lulc greene et al 2009 after the drought the basin recorded an increasing trend in rainfall amount which contributed to the increase in water bodies between 1986 and 2002 bessah et al 2019 on the other hand galamsey caused the deline in water bodies in the second interval through water diversion to galamsey sites and degradation of water quality to a mud like water body awotwi et al 2019 the results further showed a continuous decline in natural vegetation at the expense of land use for agriculture and settlement the biophysical table containing the curve number cn was estimated from the washington state department of transportation wsdot highway runoff manual wsdot 2014 and hydrologic soil cover complexes prepared by natural resources conservation service and agricultural research service nrcs 2017 the monthly crop factor or plant evapotranspiration coefficient kc was sourced from sharp et al 2018 both adopted curve number and crop factor are presented in table 1 2 3 climate input data observed climate records from 1981 2010 were acquired from the ghana meteorological agency and the simulated future climate scenarios were for the period 2020 2049 the regional climate scenario was obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex the mean output of the second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 by the canadian centre for climate modeling and analysis cccma cccma canesm2 and the mid resolution model of institut pierre simon laplace ipsl ipsl cm5a mr at 44 km spatial resolution covering africa were used the sub regional climate scenario was obtained from the weather research and forecasting wrf model the mean output of the general fluid dynamics laboratory s earth system model gfdl esm2m and the hadley centre s global environment model hadgem2 es at 12 km covering west africa were used see table s2 in the supplementary material the local climate scenario was simulated from a statistical downscaling model sdsm dc at 0 002 km spatial resolution the ensemble mean of the five models was computed and hereinafter referred to as ensemble mean and or ensemble different climate models at varying spatial resolution were used because they have different capacity in mimicking local climate furthermore it was done to determine the hydrological response to climate simulations from varying spatial resolution and enhance future projections via the ensembling of the different climate models in this study the performance of the models in simulating the observed rainfall and temperature were evaluated and those with unacceptable time series based metrics results nash sutcliffe efficiency root mean square error and coefficient of determination were bias corrected details about these climate models and their bias correction methods variance scaling method was used for temperature while linear scaling plus double quantile mapping were used for rainfall are provided in bessah et al

under the ipcc s rcp 4 5 emission scenario vuuren et al 2011 ipcc 2014 rain events were the lowest in january for both the observed and the future period from the climate models whereas the highest rain events varied in months amongst the models table 2 the month of june had the highest rain event for the observed sdsm and cordex rca4 while may was the highest for wrf model the penman monteith evapotranspiration method in instat v3 36 was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration eto tables s3 s9 in supplementary material average insolation incident on a horizontal surface mj m 2 day relative humidity at 2 m above sea level wind speed at 10 m above the surface of the earth m s records from 1983 2010 1981 1982 were missing data were acquired from nasa power database nasa power 2018 to calculate eto with observed mean temperature for the historical period wind speed was converted to 2 m above earth surface with a factor of 1 33 due to the lack of observed insolation relative humidity rh and wind speed data a five year record 2012 2017 of the acquired three parameters from nasa power database were replicated six times to cover 30 years and used with the mean temperature of the models from 2020 2049 to estimate the future eto we assumed insolation rh and wind speed for the future period to follow the same cycle every 5 years for a 30 year period as no modelled records of future variations in these variables were available this was because the available data after 2010 for a convenient replication was from 2012 2017 secondly it was done to control the errors or uncertainties in using unverified remotely sensed climate data to bias correct model simulations all maps of monthly precipitation records presented in tables of the supplementary material and reference evapotranspiration were created using ordinary kriging interpolation in arcgis 10 3 this approach minimises interpolation errors during predictions by the use of semi variogram models isaaks

practical and c sill 2 4 data analysis and presentation water yield responses to lulc change were assessed with observed climate data based on lulc maps of 1986 2002 and 2018 while the impact of climate change was assessed under the regional sub regional and local climate scale simulations using lulc map of 2018 the impact of both lulc and climate change was determined between the observed and future yield using climate models to determine the lulc change impact on water yield the lulc of 1986 2002 and 2018 were simulated in combination with the mean climate of the historical period from 1981 to 2010 and pixel based variation in yield determined for comparison of land use management impact for the second part of the analyses on the impact of climate change on water yield historical observed climate 1981 2010 and future climate simulations cordex rca4 wrf and sdsm from 2020 2049 were simulated in combination with the lulc of 2018 and the output compared the difference in yield under climate change was calculated by pixel subtraction of historical yield from the three future simulations outputs 3 results 3 1 water yield from the observed climate period under different lulc the mean annual water yield for the observed climate period 1981 2010 for the years 1986 2002 and 2018 were very similar in the range of 0 336 mm 0 334 mm and 0 336 mm respectively fig 2 a this implies that mean annual yield in a land parcel or pixel was directly proportional to climate conditions especially rainfall however the expansion of arable bare lands and settlement from 1986 2018 showed that wide locations of the basin under these two classes had water yield between 100 mm 200 mm per year the yield was highest in the settlement land use class and least under forest settlement yielded water between 200 mm 240 mm averagely while that of forest was less than 40 mm and open vegetation was between 41 160 mm fig 2a mean annual water yield for each land class over the three lulc periods was not different in depth mm this could be due to the fact that yield was assessed under the same climatic condition the spatial distribution of water yield was according to the locations of land use classes in the assessed years the 2 mm water yield difference between 2002 and the other two years 1986 and 2018 had the same monthly mean water yield values was due to the monthly variations in january march may june and july at 0 04 0 53 0 21 0 43 and 0 15 mm respectively details presented in figure s2 s4 in the supplementary material the difference determined from the highest mean values under land use change was due to the extreme spatial changes in water yield between 287 45 mm and 288 9 mm fig 2b land use change between 1986 and 2002 showed more distribution of decreased yield in the pra main sub basin in the range of 200 288 mm and a concentrated increase of yield in the north of the same sub basin at an average of 145 mm fig 2b generally pra main and offin sub basins showed the highest distribution of increase 140 mm and decrease 200 mm in the first interval 1986 2002 of land use change birim sub basin also experienced an increase in yield at the east end which could have contributed to the flooding of the birim river during this period fig 2b in the second interval 2002 2018 offin sub basin showed the highest decrease in water yield however the northern part of the pra river basin and a small portion of the south showed an increase in water yield fig 2b the land use change between 1986 and 2018 spatially showed a smaller decrease in water yield distribution compared to 1986 2002 and 2002 2018 change furthermore there was a dominant increased distribution in the north and east end of the basin fig 2b although invest model was limited in accounting for baseflow lulc change significantly influenced the distribution of water yield extreme increase and decrease across the basin 3 2 future changes in annual water yield water yield was projected to decrease by 46 48 and 35 under the regional sub regional and ensemble mean climate conditions respectively and to increase by 44 under the local climate conditions fig 3 a the widest coverage of yield for the regional sub regional and ensemble mean conditions was at an average of 80 mm whereas that of the local was about 180 mm fig 3a the regional climate condition showed a general decreasing pattern of water yield from the north towards the south east of the pra river basin the ensemble of the climate models showed a yield that unified the extreme spatial increase and decrease across the basin the regional and sub regional climate scenarios generally showed only a decreasing change in yield over the basin while the ensemble showed that some locations are expected not to experience any change in water yield that is 0 mm change in yield fig 3b spatially regional and sub regional climate scenarios showed a decrease in the range of 7 218 mm and 13 179 mm respectively fig 3b in contrast the sub regional simulation showed an even distribution of significant decrease across the basin in the range of 70 150 mm while the regional on the other hand showed a less decrease in the northern part of the basin especially in the offin sub basin in the range of 20 70 mm fig 3b the local climate scenario showed a decrease in water yield in few locations majorly in the pra main sub basin and the highest increase in yield in the birim sub basin at the east end of the basin fig 3b the change in water yield under the local climate ranged between 18 mm and 232 mm therefore the 44 increase in yield under the local climate scenario does not cover the whole basin although the majority of the places especially the birim and offin sub basins would benefit from such increase in yield 3 3 variations in seasonal yield of water the ensemble mean of the climate models projected mean water yield to decrease across the four seasons in the year mean seasonal water yield was 2 16 12 and 9 mm less in the future period of december february djf march may mam june august jja and september november son seasons respectively fig 4 a and 4b djf in future had wide coverage of low yield except for the eastern part which was an average of 5 mm fig 4b despite the mean decrease in yield in future for djf the spatial distribution generally showed an increase in most part of the basin especially in the birim sub basin in the range of 1 5 mm fig 4c in mam the highest mean of water yield with the widest coverage from the central to the west was about 30 mm and 15 mm in the historical and future period respectively fig 4a and 4b the highest seasonal decrease spatially was in mam this will affect the major cropping season that is mostly from march to july similar spatial variations were observed in jja and son seasons spatially the decrease in water yield in jja and son was in the north of pra main sub basin and south of birim sub basin respectively at a mean value of about 10 mm fig 4c generally son showed a minimal change between 3 mm and 0 mm this could limit water availability for dry season cropping mostly practised in the basin for the production of vegetables details of monthly water yield under the future climate scenarios are presented in the supplementary material figs s5 s8 therefore climate change would impact water yield in all season in the basin with more of a decrease in mam and increase in djf spatially fig 4c 4 discussion land use change influenced water yield in the assessed periods specifically in determining the location and volume of yield while climate determined its depth the difference in mean annual water yield under land use change was negligible about 2 mm and does not reveal details of the impact this could be due to the fact that water yield is based on pixels and not necessary a flow as in other traditional hydrological models the difference in yield at pixel scale showed that land use change had a significant impact on water yield while some locations experienced an increased above 250 mm others experienced a decrease beyond the same value the spatial trend of change in land use also determined which location of the basin could need either flood or drought intervention measures for instance the difference between 1986 and 2002 showed more of flood possibility in the offin sub basin which changed to the possibility of a drought situation due to the general distribution of decreased yield between 2002 and 2018 this can be attributed to the changes in lulc in the sub basin between the assessed years although forest declined in the first interval and most of the reserves were recovered in the second interval the conversion to open vegetation in the first interval could contribute to higher water yield in 2002 fig s1 in supplementary material the conversion from 2002 to 2018 showed an increasing arable bare lands and settlement taking over open water areas in the earlier lulc map fig s1 therefore water yield would negatively be impacted in the second interval fig 2b under the same climatic condition invest was capable of determining an amount of yield available per location under the different land use scenarios the maximum change in annual water yield was a decrease of about 83 and an increase of about 86 based on the mean yield of the assessed years under land use change across the basin awotwi et al 2019 also reported a marginal decrease in surface water yield of approximately 3 34 mm as a result of lulc changes between 1986 and 2000 simulated using the swat model in the study area their findings relate with the results of this study showing a mean annual yield change of 2 mm between 1986 and 2002 the changes would be largely due to the difference in the model conceptualization and the variation in type of datasets used for example awotwi et al 2019 used maximum likelihood algorithm for lulc classification while this study employed random forest algorithm furthermore awotwi et al 2019 reported a spatial distribution change in water yield between 1986 and 2016 in the range from 13 mm to 69 mm and a baseflow between 79 mm and 73 mm in the study area the spatial distribution of this study between a similar period 1986 and 2018 showed an extreme change in water yield between 279 mm and 289 mm although the different concept of water yield modelling in swat and invest does not warrant exact value comparison luke and hack 2018 the variations help to understand some of the processes that could have led to the results for instance the current version of invest model is limited in the estimation of baseflow that is no quantitative estimation which could increase the amount of water yield sharp et al 2018 therefore based on the findings in this study the invest tool was capable of demonstrating the magnitude and distribution of land use change impact on mean annual water yield in the pra river basin which are relevant for research and decision making especially in deciding on specific locations that call for immediate land use and management intervention in addressing climate change impact on water resources at the basin scale the projected change in mean annual water yield at 46 48 35 and 44 by regional sub regional ensemble mean and local climate conditions respectively relate extreme positive and negative projected changes with the findings of amisigo et al 2015 in the pra river basin according to amisigo et al 2015 annual runoff in the study area could change by 12 2 34 4 25 9 and 60 9 under the global wet ncar ccsm3 0 a2 global dry csiro mk3 0 a2 ghana dry ipsl cm4 b1 and wet ncar pcm1 a1b scenarios respectively from 2011 2050 in reference to 1950 2000 while the a2 scenario represents more of a divided world the b1 scenario is characterised by a more ecologically friendly world that emphasis on global economic solutions and social and environmental stability fenech et al 2007 the a1b scenario is also of an integrated world with a balanced emphasis on all energy sources the rcp4 5 used for climate simulations in this study is close in description to emission scenario b1 and a1b vuuren et al 2011 used by amisigo et al 2015 a pearson correlation factor of r 0 735 was found between surface runoff and water yield for the study area awotwi et al 2019 therefore projected changes negative under regional and sub regional climate scenarios and positive under local climate scenario in water yield in this study under climate change for the future period 2020 2049 relate with the changed pattern of ghana dry and ghana wet scenarios reported by amisigo et al 2015 for the period 2011 2050 the correlation between rainfall and runoff changes has been found to be at r 0 49 for west africa roudier et al 2014 relatively climate change more specifically the changes in rainfall patterns could contribute to approximately 50 of changes in the amount of surface water generation water yield runoff etc according to bessah et al 2019 change in rainfall was projected by the sub regional and local climate scenarios to increase by 10 93 and 13 43 whereas the regional and ensemble mean climate scenarios projected a decrease of 22 08 and 1 77 respectively paradoxically the sub regional climate scenario projected an increase in rainfall by 10 93 resulting in a decreased water yield by 48 in future another paradox was the degree of change in water yield which was higher in the sub regional than the regional climate conditions despite the opposite projection in change of rainfall as the local at 0 002 km tends towards positive the sub regional at 12 km condition was higher in the negative than the regional at 44 km this implies that the spatial resolution of climate model and their projected change in rainfall could not be used in determining the pattern of change of water yield in the pra river basin therefore water yield is not directly proportional to rainfall trend in the basin in this study although it has the highest contribution to water yield queensland government 2011 the seasonal changes in future for the ensemble is expected to have a negative impact on crop production prolonged dry spells and drought experienced by farmers in the past has resulted in crop failure and increased the vulnerability of the basin to food insecurity bessah 2019 unpublished moreover the decrease in yield by the regional sub regional and ensemble mean arouses concerns for the availability of water to run the proposed hydro dam sustainably on the pra river basin kabo bah et al 2016 nevertheless the local climate scenario could increase water yield during all season in the basin this could create the situation of increased surface water leading to an opportunity for irrigation crop production during the dry or lean prolonged dry spells in a rainy season seasons on the other hand it could cause flood disaster especially on farms situated on low lands and close to rivers flooding on farms has been a regular occurrence in some communities within the pra river basin located close to the three main rivers pra birim and offin road access to the farms are impossible during such situation and both harvested and maturing crops are usually destroyed as often frequently observed in the northern part of ghana armah et al 2010 akwei 2017 the spatial distribution is a guide to locations that could be in need of either flood adaptation or drought resilience interventions in all seasons in the future period 5 conclusion using the invest model to assess the hydrological ecosystem services of water yield in the pra river basin produced results within ranges of other tools and in situ data collected in a comparable period it was shown that changes in land use from 1986 2018 had minimal influence on the overall mean annual water yield in the basin although the spatial variation was significant at extreme decreased and increased yield at some specific locations however climate showed a significant influence on mean water yield at varying degrees according to the spatial resolution of the climate models but with no particular pattern of change apart from the local climate projecting an increase in water yield all other conditions projected yield to decrease in the coming decades we recommend that high resolution climate models capable of capturing the local climate such as sdsm reported in previous studies in the basin be compared in climate change impact studies in other sensitive locations like the savannah zones of ghana it will help to ascertain the future possible ways to aid in site specific adaptation planning and policy formulation improved satellite and in situ surveillance systems agronomical assistance and enforcement of environmental law e g the implementation of the integrated water resources management policy and riparian buffer policy could help reduce the impacts of land use change on water yield in the offin and pra main sub basins irrigation farming should be encouraged and farmers empowered with knowledge and equipment support for adoption in order to enhance their adaptation to the projected extreme climate events flood and drought since the basin contribute significantly to the production of tree crops like cocoa and tuber crops with valuable economic gains to the nation author contribution all

of 44 km 12 km and 0 002 km respectively to drive the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs model at three time periods of land use land cover lulc changes in historical water yield simulated for 1986 2002 2018 lulc using the mean climatic parameters from 1981 2010 and future scenario simulated for 2018 lulc using the mean climatic parameters from 2020 2049 for annual seasonal and monthly periods were assessed new hydrological insights for the region the results show that future annual water yield could change by 46 48 44 and 35 under the regional sub regional local and ensemble mean of the climate scenarios respectively seasonal water yield from the ensemble mean of the future climate scenario was projected to decrease between 2 16 mm with a mean decrease of 33 39 during the december february season there was no directional effect of spatial resolution on water yield the future period could be impacted by both drought and flood we recommend that re afforestation should be encouraged to improve infiltration and reduce deforestation which was 2 27 per annum in the assessed period to prevent flood causing runoffs while irrigation technology will help to improve resilience to drought keywords climate change invest model land use land cover change pra river basin regional climate models sdsm dc water yield 1 introduction sustainability of water resources has become a global debate in this era of climate change globally accessible freshwater resources are less than 1 of the global water stock and its uneven spatial and temporal distribution along with overexploitation of water resources for human activities which often causes water scarcity savenije 2000 hoekstra and mekonnen 2011 anthropogenic degradation of watersheds is one of the main direct causes of freshwater scarcity murphy and kapelle 2014 water sustainability depends on ecosystem structure and function in a watershed and a current challenge due to unplanned use resulting from population and economic growth changes in land use and global dynamics it is further threatened by climate change at the global regional and local scale enanga et al 2011 boon and ahenkan 2012 bangash et al 2013 niang et al 2014 ipcc 2014 world bank group 2016 the negative consequences associated with this situation are amplified during the dry season when water resources can usually be insufficient to meet both human and riverine ecosystem needs jujnovsky et al 2010 about 48 of the world s population in 2025 is projected to live in basins that are water stressed bangash et al 2013 a rising world population is forecast to be 9 7 billion people by 2050 and sub saharan africa which is projected to double by that period could subsequently cause major changes in lifestyle especially in terms of spending and food choices un desa 2019 water will be a major resource required to increase food production approximately 70 to meet global food needs in 2050 steduto et al 2012 a potential constraint to food production is the threat of water scarcity steduto et al 2012 davis et al 2015 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 projected 10 30 reduction in water availability by 2050 over some dry regions at mid latitudes and in the dry tropics this is particularly concerning as some of these locations are currently water stressed in ethiopia climate change accounted for 70 changes in water resources in comparison with land use change abera et al 2019 floods and droughts are the notable extreme impacts of climate change evidenced mostly in sub saharan africa causing significant economic losses due to the low resilience capacity of the region resulting from high poverty and political instability unep 2002 bo et al 2004 fao 2009 davis et al 2015 research conducted by the water footprint network 2018 showed that ghana annually faces blue water amount of surface or ground water used for the production of a good or service scarcity during the dry seasons november february studies show that climate change is expected to further worsen this situation as it may result in erratic rainfall in the tropics which would alter the trend of runoff and river flows milly et al 2005 ipcc 2007 lópez moreno et al 2011 the trend of change in water availability is inconsistent in ghana under different climate models kasei 2009 obuobie et al 2012 nutsukpo et al 2013 amisigo et al 2015 the pra river basin the leading tuber crop production zone of ghana and a major producer of cocoa an economic crop in ghana has been found to be water stressed and projected to undergo water scarcity 681 m3 per capita per year and absolute scarcity 306 m3 per capita per year in 2020 and 2050 respectively obuobie et al 2012 these findings as well as regional and global projections of climate change could negatively impact on food security and the economy of ghana this situation would be critical for the inhabitants of ghana s pra river basin who depend majorly on agriculture for their livelihood and are already facing challenges due to unsustainable management of its watersheds because of intensified human activities wrc 2012 murphy and kapelle 2014 duncan et al 2019 amisigo et al 2015 projected both positive and negative change in runoff in the pra river basin for the period 2011 2050 whereas obuobie et al 2012 projected only negative change for streamflow in the same basin from 2006 2065 according to awotwi et al 2019 settlement and mining land use classes showed a strong positive correlation with water yield while cropland showed a weak correlation therefore land use expansion into forest reduces the service of vegetation in regulating the amount of water yield the pra river basin is one of the most extensively and intensively used river basins in ghana in terms of settlements agriculture logging and mining particularly because of its valuable tree species mineral ore deposits and suitable environment for farming therefore the wide variations in water availability due to climate and anthropogenic activities may have severe local impacts and hence further assessment with high resolution models and a combination of varied resolutions models is needed moreover quantifying the distribution of water resources at the basin level under both climate and land use change scenarios can help identify vulnerable locations for adequate adaptation planning and implementation the current challenges in such assessment are the high data requirement pre processing of data and time and training efforts required by traditional hydrological models in achieving the desired goals with broader spatial representation of results to support decision making process vogl et al 2016 luke and hack 2018 furthermore models that can support hydrological ecosystem service hes decisions should be conceptualized to account for changes in land use at the parcel level guswa et al 2014 which is not adequately represented in traditional hydrological models adopting the integrated valuation of ecosystem service and trade offs invest model with its minimal application efforts and data requirements makes it suitable and capable of serving areas with scarce data like sub saharan africa and the pra river basin in particular volk 2014 ibrahim et al 2015 komi et al 2017 the spatially explicit nature and quick scenario generation of large geographical areas using invest could facilitate the decision making process protect degrading water resources by highlighting hotspots that would require urgent land management interventions and improve monitoring of hydrological ecosystem services in the long term at reduced cost dimobe et al 2015 vogl et al 2016 luke and hack 2018 sharp et al 2018 these strengths make the tool attractive to use as opposed to some of the complex hydrological models such as swat soil and water assessment tool fiesta fog interception for the enhancement of streamflow in tropical areas and aries artificial intelligence for ecosystem services according to ochoa and urbina cardona 2017 invest was among the most commonly used tools implemented for spatial modelling of hes the aim of this study was to therefore assess the variations in the impacts of future regional and local climate simulations and land use change on water yields using a hydrological ecosystem service tool in order to inform water resources management policies in the pra river basin of ghana the following questions were investigated what was the change in annual water yield based on 1986 2002 and 2018 lulc what is the expected degree of change in annual water yield under regional and local climate scale scenarios for the future period 2020 2049 what could be the future variations in seasonal water yield in the basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the pra river basin has the highest density of settlements with over 1300 towns in ghana and covers an area of 23 330 70 km2 between latitudes 4 58ꞌ n and 7 11ꞌ n and longitudes 0 25ꞌ w and 2 13ꞌ w wrc 2012 the pra river basin is underlain majorly by soil with moderately high runoff potential ross et al 2018 and lies at an elevation range between 10 m and 848 m fig 1 a this makes the low areas of the basin vulnerable to water disasters during extremes rainfall events the mean annual values of rainfall minimum and maximum temperatures for the period 1981 2010 were 1446 mm 21 74 c and 31 6 c respectively bessah et al 2018 2019 the climatic conditions in the basin promote rapid vegetative growth and are conducive for farming fig 1b especially during the rainy seasons furthermore both large and small scale mining activities take place in the basin thereby creating some intense land use change dynamics this has resulted in land use competition between farmers and miners especially cocoa farmers and small scale illegal miners locally known as galamsey dickson and benneh 1995 coniwas 2011 kusimi et al 2015 moreover water demand for activities in the basin is critical since a population from about 1300 towns in 41 districts in ghana depends on the basin for their water supply that is an estimated population of 5 9 million people in the basin based on a growth rate of 2 2 according to the 2000 census wrc 2012 kusimi et al 2015 findings from the ipcc fifth assessment report s 43 global circulation models gcms projected temperature to increase in the range of 1 2 c 5 1 c and rainfall to decrease in the range of 0 88 1 66 in the 21st century in the pra river basin ipcc 2014 bessah et al 2018 2019 however gcms at coarse spatial resolution does not provide some of the vital components of the regional and local climate which contribute maximally to the changes observed at a basin level wilby and wigley 1997 wilby et al 2014 this implies that higher spatial resolution climate models either single or combined are needed to assess the changes in climate and its impact on water resources to guide the planning of appropriate adaptation measures for the basin s inhabitants 2 2 hydrological ecosystem service modelling using invest the hes modelled in this study was water yield which falls under the provisional category of hes the invest seasonal water yield model provides guidance regarding the contribution of land parcels to the generation of both baseflow and quick flow the baseflow is defined as the generation of streamflow with watershed residence times of months to years while quick flow represents the generation of streamflow with watershed residence times of hours to days sharp et al 2018 the model computes spatial indices that quantify the relative contribution of a parcel of land to the generation of both baseflow and quick flow the first approach of the model emphasises the land use and land cover lulc of a site since the focus is on net generation from the pixel or parcel of land while the second approach represents the actual streamflow generated by a pixel since actual streamflow cannot be less than zero this approach unlike the first result in indices that are greater than or equal to zero the current version of invest seasonal water yield model used in this study does not estimate quantitative baseflow but only the relative contributions per pixels this is a limitation that developers are working on to address in a separate tool in the next version of the invest model sharp et al 2018 it is worth stating that the water yield from the invest model provides averages and not the extremes and neglects the interactions between groundwater surface and deep in its estimations the model was set up by pre processing the datasets into the same pixel size in a gis environment before using them in the invest model a combination of raster vector and csv data are required with specific naming guidelines for data files the data used as inputs to the model are presented in table s1 in the supplementary material all raster datasets were resampled to a 30 m spatial resolution in arcgis 10 3 the resampling was done to maintain consistency with the resolution of the lulc and dem furthermore raster input datasets of invest model are required to have the same spatial resolution lulc maps of 1986 2002 and 2018 generated from landsat images for the study area were used fig s1 in the supplementary material the random forest algorithm for supervised classification was employed in r software in combination with qgis for the lulc maps generation and change detection analysis the invest model was not tested for readjustment due to the lack of observed water yield records in the study area from the land use analysis forest and open vegetation were reported to approximately decrease by 20 and 3 between 1986 and 2002 while from 2002 2018 there was an approximate decrease of 36 and 1 respectively settlement and arable bare lands increased in both periods 1986 2002 and 2002 2018 water bodies including all open water such as lakes rivers and temporarily stored surface water increased by about 300 in the first period and decreased by 75 in the second period figure s1 the west african drought in 1983 was a major reason for the reduced

in table 1 2 3 climate input data observed climate records from 1981 2010 were acquired from the ghana meteorological agency and the simulated future climate scenarios were for the period 2020 2049 the regional climate scenario was obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex the mean output of the second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 by the canadian centre for climate modeling and analysis cccma cccma canesm2 and the mid resolution model of institut pierre simon laplace ipsl ipsl cm5a mr at 44 km spatial resolution covering africa were used the sub regional climate scenario was obtained from the weather research and forecasting wrf model the mean output of the general fluid dynamics laboratory s earth system model gfdl esm2m and the hadley centre s global environment model hadgem2 es at 12 km covering west africa were used see table s2 in the supplementary material the local climate scenario was simulated from a statistical downscaling model sdsm dc at 0 002 km spatial resolution the ensemble mean of the five models was computed and hereinafter referred to as ensemble mean and or ensemble different climate models at varying spatial resolution were used because they have different capacity in mimicking local climate furthermore it was done to determine the hydrological response to climate simulations from varying spatial resolution and enhance future projections via the ensembling of the different climate models in this study the performance of the models in simulating the observed rainfall and temperature were evaluated and those with unacceptable time series based metrics results nash sutcliffe efficiency root mean square error and coefficient of determination were bias corrected details about these climate models and their bias correction methods variance scaling method was used for temperature while linear scaling plus double quantile mapping were used for rainfall are provided in bessah et al

under the ipcc s rcp 4 5 emission scenario vuuren et al 2011 ipcc 2014 rain events were the lowest in january for both the observed and the future period from the climate models whereas the highest

the models from 2020 2049 to estimate the future eto we assumed insolation rh and wind speed for the future period to follow the same cycle every 5 years for a 30 year period as no modelled records of future variations in these variables were available this was because the available data after 2010 for a convenient replication was from 2012 2017 secondly it was done to control the errors or

practical and c sill 2 4 data analysis and presentation water yield responses to lulc change were assessed with observed climate data based on lulc maps of 1986 2002 and 2018 while the impact of climate change was assessed under the regional sub regional and local climate scale simulations using lulc map of 2018 the impact of both lulc and climate change was determined between the observed and future yield using climate models to determine the lulc change impact on water yield the lulc of 1986 2002 and 2018 were simulated in combination with the mean climate of the historical period from 1981 to 2010 and pixel based variation in yield determined for comparison of land use management impact for the second part of the analyses on the impact of climate change on water yield historical observed climate 1981 2010 and future climate simulations cordex rca4 wrf and sdsm from 2020 2049 were simulated in combination with the lulc of 2018 and the output compared the difference in yield under climate change was calculated by pixel subtraction of historical yield from the three future simulations outputs 3 results 3 1 water yield from the observed climate period under different lulc the mean annual water yield for the observed climate period 1981 2010 for the years 1986 2002 and 2018 were very similar in the range of 0 336 mm 0 334 mm and 0 336 mm respectively fig 2 a this implies that mean annual yield in a land parcel or pixel was directly proportional to climate conditions especially rainfall however the expansion of arable bare lands and settlement from 1986 2018 showed that wide locations of the basin under these two classes had water yield between 100 mm 200 mm per year the yield was highest in the settlement land use class and least under forest settlement yielded water between 200 mm 240 mm averagely while that of forest was less than 40 mm and open vegetation was between 41 160 mm fig 2a mean annual water yield for each land class over the three lulc periods was not different in depth mm this could be due to the fact that yield was assessed under the same climatic condition the spatial distribution of water yield was according to the locations of land use classes in the assessed years the 2 mm water yield difference between 2002 and the other two years 1986 and 2018 had the same monthly mean water yield values was due to the monthly variations in january march may june and july at 0 04 0 53 0 21 0 43 and 0 15 mm respectively details presented in figure s2 s4 in the supplementary material the difference determined from the highest mean values under land use change was due to the extreme spatial changes in water yield between 287 45 mm and 288 9 mm fig 2b land use change between 1986 and 2002 showed more distribution of decreased yield in the pra main sub basin in the range of 200 288 mm and a concentrated increase of yield in the north of the same sub basin at an average of 145 mm fig 2b generally pra main and offin sub basins showed the highest distribution of increase 140 mm and decrease 200 mm in the first interval 1986 2002 of land use change birim sub basin also experienced an increase in yield at the east end which could have contributed to the flooding of the birim river during this period fig 2b in the second interval 2002 2018 offin sub basin showed the highest decrease in water yield however the northern part of the pra river basin and a small portion of the south showed an increase in water yield fig 2b the land use change between 1986 and 2018 spatially showed a smaller decrease in water yield distribution compared to 1986 2002 and 2002 2018 change furthermore there was a dominant increased distribution in the north and east end of the basin fig 2b although invest model was limited in accounting for baseflow lulc change significantly influenced the distribution of water yield extreme increase and decrease across the basin 3 2 future changes in annual water yield water yield was projected to decrease by 46 48 and 35 under the regional sub regional and ensemble mean climate conditions respectively and to increase by 44 under the local climate conditions fig 3 a the widest coverage of yield for the regional sub regional and ensemble mean conditions was at an average of 80 mm whereas that of the local was about 180 mm fig 3a the regional climate condition showed a general decreasing pattern of water yield from the north towards the south east of the pra river basin the ensemble of the climate models showed a yield that unified the extreme spatial increase and decrease across the basin the regional and sub regional climate scenarios generally showed only a decreasing change in yield over the basin while the ensemble showed that some locations are expected not to experience any change in water yield that is 0 mm change in yield fig 3b spatially regional and sub regional climate scenarios showed a decrease in the range of 7 218 mm and 13 179 mm respectively fig 3b in contrast the sub regional simulation showed an even distribution of significant decrease across the basin in the range of 70 150 mm while the regional on the other hand showed a less decrease in the northern part of the basin especially in the offin sub basin in the range of 20 70 mm fig 3b the local climate scenario showed a decrease in water yield in few locations majorly in the pra main sub basin and the highest increase in yield in the birim sub basin at the east end of the basin fig 3b the change in water yield under the local climate ranged between 18 mm and 232 mm therefore the 44 increase in yield under the local climate scenario does not cover the whole basin although the majority of the places especially the birim and offin sub basins would benefit from such increase in yield 3 3 variations in seasonal yield of water the ensemble mean of the climate models projected mean water yield to decrease across the four seasons in the year mean seasonal water yield was 2 16 12 and 9 mm less in the future period of december february djf march may mam june august jja and september november son seasons respectively fig 4 a and 4b djf in future had wide coverage of low yield except for the eastern part which was an average of 5 mm fig 4b despite the mean decrease in yield in future for djf the spatial distribution generally showed an increase in most part of the basin especially in the birim sub basin in the range of 1 5 mm fig 4c in mam the highest mean of water yield with the widest coverage from the central to the west was about 30 mm and 15 mm in the historical and future period respectively fig 4a and 4b the highest seasonal decrease spatially was in mam this will affect the major cropping season that is mostly from march to july similar spatial variations were observed in jja and son seasons spatially the decrease in water yield in jja and son was in the north of pra main sub basin and south of birim sub basin respectively at a mean value of about 10 mm fig 4c generally son showed a minimal change between 3 mm and 0 mm this could limit water availability for dry season cropping mostly practised in the basin for the production of vegetables details of monthly water yield under the future climate scenarios are presented in the supplementary material figs s5 s8 therefore climate change would impact water yield in all season in the basin with more of a decrease in mam and increase in djf spatially fig 4c 4 discussion land use change influenced water yield in the assessed periods specifically in determining the location and volume of yield while climate determined its depth the difference in mean annual water yield under land use change was negligible about 2 mm and does not reveal details of the impact this could be due to the fact that water yield is based on pixels and not necessary a flow as in other traditional hydrological models the difference in yield at pixel scale showed that land use change had a significant impact on water yield while some locations experienced an increased above 250 mm others experienced a decrease beyond the same value the spatial trend of change in land use also determined which location of the basin could need either flood or drought intervention measures for instance the difference between 1986 and 2002 showed more of flood possibility in the offin sub basin which changed to the possibility of a drought situation due to the general distribution of decreased yield between 2002 and 2018 this can be attributed to the changes in lulc in the sub basin between the assessed years although forest declined in the first interval and most of the reserves were recovered in the second interval the conversion to open vegetation in the first interval could contribute to higher water yield in 2002 fig s1 in supplementary material the conversion from 2002 to 2018 showed an increasing arable bare lands and settlement taking over open water areas in the earlier lulc map fig s1 therefore water yield would negatively be impacted in the second interval fig 2b under the same climatic condition invest was capable of determining an amount of yield available per location under the different land use scenarios the maximum change in annual water yield was a decrease of about 83 and an increase of about 86 based on the mean yield of the assessed years under land use change across the basin awotwi et al 2019 also reported a marginal decrease in surface water yield of approximately 3 34 mm as a result of lulc changes between 1986 and 2000 simulated using the swat model in the study area their findings relate with the results of this study showing a mean annual yield change of 2 mm between 1986 and 2002 the changes would be largely due to the difference in the model conceptualization and the variation in type of datasets used for example awotwi et al 2019 used maximum likelihood algorithm for lulc classification while this study employed random forest algorithm furthermore awotwi et al 2019 reported a spatial distribution change in water yield between 1986 and 2016 in the range from 13 mm to 69 mm and a baseflow between 79 mm and 73 mm in the study area the spatial distribution of this study between a similar period 1986 and 2018 showed an extreme change in water yield between 279 mm and 289 mm although the different concept of water yield modelling in swat and invest does not warrant exact value comparison luke and hack 2018 the variations help to understand some of the processes that could have led to the results for instance the current version of invest model is limited in the estimation of baseflow that is no quantitative estimation which could increase the amount of water yield sharp et al 2018 therefore based on the findings in this study the invest tool was capable of demonstrating the magnitude and distribution of land use change impact on mean annual water yield in the pra river basin which are relevant for research and decision making especially in deciding on specific locations that call for immediate land use and management intervention in addressing climate change impact on water resources at the basin scale the projected change in mean annual water yield at 46 48 35 and 44 by regional sub regional ensemble mean and local climate conditions respectively relate extreme positive and negative projected changes with the findings of amisigo et al 2015 in the pra river basin according to amisigo et al 2015 annual runoff in the study area could change by 12 2 34 4 25 9 and 60 9 under the global wet ncar ccsm3 0 a2 global dry csiro mk3 0 a2 ghana dry ipsl cm4 b1 and wet ncar pcm1 a1b scenarios respectively from 2011 2050 in reference to 1950 2000 while the a2 scenario represents more of a divided world the b1 scenario is characterised by a more ecologically friendly world that emphasis on global economic solutions and social and environmental stability fenech et al 2007 the a1b scenario is also of an integrated world with a balanced emphasis on all energy sources the rcp4 5 used for climate simulations in this study is close in description to emission scenario b1 and a1b vuuren et al 2011 used by amisigo et al 2015 a pearson correlation factor of r 0 735 was found between surface runoff and water yield for the study area awotwi et al 2019 therefore projected changes negative under regional and sub regional climate scenarios and positive under local climate scenario in water yield in this study under climate change for the future period 2020 2049 relate with the changed pattern of ghana dry and ghana wet scenarios reported by amisigo et al 2015 for the period 2011 2050 the correlation between rainfall and runoff changes has been found to be at r 0 49 for west africa roudier et al 2014 relatively climate change more specifically the changes in rainfall patterns could contribute to approximately 50 of changes in the amount of surface water generation water yield runoff etc according to bessah et al 2019 change in rainfall was projected by the sub regional and local climate scenarios to increase by 10 93 and 13 43 whereas the regional and ensemble mean climate scenarios projected a decrease of 22 08 and 1 77 respectively paradoxically the sub regional climate scenario projected an increase in rainfall by 10 93 resulting in a decreased water yield by 48 in future another paradox was the degree of change in water yield which was higher in the sub regional than the regional climate conditions despite the opposite projection in change of rainfall as the local at 0 002 km tends towards positive the sub regional at 12 km condition was higher in the negative than the regional at 44 km this implies that the spatial resolution of climate model and their projected change in rainfall could not be used in determining the pattern of change of water yield in the pra river basin therefore water yield is not directly proportional to rainfall trend in the basin in this study although it has the highest contribution to water yield queensland government 2011 the seasonal changes in future for the ensemble is expected to have a negative impact on crop production prolonged dry spells and drought experienced by farmers in the past has resulted in crop failure and increased the vulnerability of the basin to food insecurity bessah 2019 unpublished moreover the decrease in yield by the regional sub regional and ensemble mean arouses concerns for the availability of water to run the proposed hydro dam sustainably on the pra river basin kabo bah et al 2016 nevertheless the local climate scenario could increase water yield during all season in the basin this could create the situation of increased surface water leading to an opportunity for irrigation crop production during the dry or lean prolonged dry spells in a rainy season seasons on the other hand it could cause flood disaster especially on farms situated on low lands and close to rivers flooding on farms has been a regular occurrence in some communities within the pra river basin located close to the three main rivers pra birim and offin road access to the farms are impossible during such situation and both harvested and maturing crops are usually destroyed as often frequently observed in the northern part of ghana armah et al 2010 akwei 2017 the spatial distribution is a guide to locations that could be in need of either flood adaptation or drought resilience interventions in all seasons in the future period 5 conclusion using the invest model to assess the hydrological ecosystem services of water yield in the pra river basin produced results within ranges of other tools and in situ data collected in a comparable period it was shown that changes in land use from 1986 2018 had minimal influence on the overall mean annual water yield in the basin although the spatial variation was significant at extreme decreased and increased yield at some specific locations however climate showed a significant influence on mean water yield at varying degrees according to the spatial resolution of the climate models but with no particular pattern of change apart from the local climate projecting an increase in water yield all other conditions projected yield to decrease in the coming decades we recommend that high resolution climate models capable of capturing the local climate such as sdsm reported in previous studies in the basin be compared in climate change impact studies in other sensitive locations like the savannah zones of ghana it will help to ascertain the future possible ways to aid in site specific adaptation planning and policy formulation improved satellite and in situ surveillance systems agronomical assistance and enforcement of environmental law e g the implementation of the integrated water resources management policy and riparian buffer policy could help reduce the impacts of land use change on water yield in the offin and pra main sub basins irrigation farming should be encouraged and farmers empowered with knowledge and equipment support for adoption in order to enhance their adaptation to the projected extreme climate events flood and drought since the basin contribute significantly to the production of tree crops like cocoa and tuber crops with valuable economic gains to the nation author contribution all
