agricultural sources and domestic wastes 1 when these heavy metals enter the food chain they can severely harm living organisms including humans cr and pb are common carcinogenic heavy metals contributing to water pollution due to rapid industrialization exposure to these two metals especially pb has serious health impacts even at trace levels 2 thus many researchers have investigated new efficient techniques for their removal 3 5 typical techniques for water remediation include ion exchange filtration coagulation adsorption precipitation and oxidation processes 6 adsorption is considered among the most heartening methods owed to its flexibility lucidity and high competency in industrial applications 7 the exemplary adsorbent has to a stable and indissoluble matrice that offers huge binding sites nanomaterials have attracted research attention in this regard because of their large specific surface areas and huge active groups many carbon nanomaterials including graphene were used to fabricate various novel hybrid materails to wastewater treatment 8 graphene is composed of thin flat layers of hexagonal carbon lattice its oxidized form referred to as graphene oxide go is a good candidate for creating various hybrid materials go has highly active surface functional groups including hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl and epoxy that interact with polarized pollutant species it has been used as an effective adsorbent for removing pb ii co ii cu ii ni ii cd ii cr iii and zn ii 8 10 however recovery of go from aqueous solutions is difficult due to its high dispersibility 11 to address this issue researchers have been modified or prepared hybrid go composites for water treatment recently amino silanes 12 diethylenetriamine deta 13 mn doped tio2 14 and lanthanum 15 were used to modify go to increase its adsorption capacity for heavy metal removal and recovery efficiency for example go was combined with iron oxide as fe3o4 to allow the collection of nano sized adsorbent particles using a magnet 16 17 in another study a magnetic cyclic dextrin was attached to the go surface for removing heavy metals 18 go modified by magnetic metal oxides was found to be not only more efficient for adsorptive removal of heavy metals but also easily recovered from aqueous solutions in this study used magnetic gadolinium oxide gd2o3 to modify go gd is a lanthanide rare earth element commonly used as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging because of its electron transport and magnetic properties 19 20 because of its magnetic properties using gd2o3 to modify go can allow easy recycling of the adsorbent under a strong applied magnetic field taking that results into account herein ggo as a practical adsorbent in addition to its magnetic properties gd2o3 has good chemical durability and properties similar to those of fe iii and al iii which have been used for arsenic removal 7 21 24 in this study prepared ggo feasibility and surface interaction mechanism was found inorder to removal of heavy metals pb ii and cr iii by studying various influence factors including the ph adsorbent dosage initial metal concentration co existing ions effect kinetics thermodyanamics and iostherms also studied the fasibility of material for real applicability by applying to real groundwater samples the adsorptive removal of both metal ions was within the standards of the us environmental protection agency usepa the results found co existing ion carbonate significantly decreases the removal performance for cr while k and mg2 are influenced for pb removal moreover ggo can be reused up to three cycles with more than 75 removal capacity for both metal ions inaddition the obtained maximum adsorption capacity of ggo for both metal ions are comparable with various reported adsorbent materials this study may provide a conclusion that the synthesized material ggo not only facile for phase separation but also stable that can use for many cycles with minium removal capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of ggo information about the materials and characterization instrument can be found in supplementary materials go was synthesized using hummers method 25 from graphite for producing the ggo composite as shown in fig 1 go 1 g was dispersed in water and then gd no3 3 solution 5 g in 20 ml demineralized water was added dropwise the solution was aggressively stirred and its ph was adjusted to 10 using a 5 m naoh solution after 15 min of stirring the mixture was heated to 353 k maintained for 1 h cooled centrifuged and dried in a freeze drier fdb 7003 korea to obtain ggo 2 2 adsorption experiments pb ii and cr iii 1000 mg l stock solutions were prepared from pb no3 2 and cr no3 3 9h2o batch studies were performed using the desired amount of diluted metal ion solution 0 100 mg l and 0 5 g l ggo in 50 ml falcon at ph 4 0 and 298 k after equilibration for 180 min collect the sample solution using a 0 45 μm membrane syringe filter and measured the filtrate metal concentration by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the ph effect studies were conducted at different ph values 2 0 10 0 adjusted using 0 1 mol l hcl and naoh solutions while other parameters were kept the same the metal uptake capacity qe mg g of ggo was calculated using 1 q e m g g c o c e v m where v l is the total volume of solution co and ce are the initial and equilibrium metal concentrations respectively and m g is the weight of ggo the removal rate is used to compare material efficiency and practical data through 2 r e m o v a l r a t e c o c e c o 100 the re usability or recyclibility of ggo was carried out using 0 1 m hno3 as desorbing agent for desorption of metal loaded at ph 4 0 0 5 g l ggo and 298 k for 180 min was used in batch studies all studies were conducted in triplicates and take the average mean of value to minimize the discrepancies origin 8 0 was used to fit the kinetic and equilibrium data to the models using linear regression analysis 2 3 material regeneration and application to surface water samples herein the material was tested in at least five cycles of reuse the stability of adsorbent through the cycles was characterized by the metal uptake capacity qe mg g defined in eq 1 and measured in batch testing under the conditions of ph 4 0 0 5 g l adsorbent and 298 k the surface waster collected from gyeonggi do republic of korea was selected as the actual water sample for this study the details were reported at supplementary first the water was analyzed in terms of ph cations k ca2 na and mg2 anions no3 hco3 2 so4 2 and po4 3 arsenic total arsenic ast including as iii and as v iron total iron fet including fe ii and fe iii and cd ii concentrations but there is not observed cr iii and pb ii in that real surface water the elements were analyzed with icp oes and their concentrations are shown in table s1 the adsorption conditions were set to the optimal ones identified in batch studies ph 4 0 0 5 g l ggo and 298 k and maintianing 5 mg l both metal ion concentration through spiking of desired amount of pb ii and cr iii solution with the collected real surface water 2 4 diffusion layer modeling 2 pka dlm the visual minteq 3 0 software was used to apply the diffuse layer model dlm for the estimation of the surface charge effects and mechanism of ggo for model prediction the surface charge density ns of ggo was measured from the surface area 68 8 m2 g and pka values obtained from acid base titration data that gave ns 1 2 10 5 mol g 2 5 column studies aided by the electromagnetic field effective separation of the powdery ggo composite was tested using high gradient magnetic separation hgms by mounting a ferromagnetic material and inducing a high magnetic gradient around it hgms can change the flow of magnetic fluids and increase the separation efficiency of magnetic materials here the electromagnet jl magnet korea was wounded with coils and designed for insertion into a glass column length 180 mm diameter 18 mm before run it the glass column was filled with steel wool fine grade aisi 434 stainless steel wool to induce a strong magnetic field with a high gradient the above metal spiked real surface water used for this column studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 ggo characterization the structure and functional groups of an adsorbent influence its properties the ft ir spectrum of ggo is shown in fig 2 a the peak at 591 cm 1 is indicating to gdo vibration at gd2o3 the broadband observed at approximately 3411 cm 1 is ascribed to oh bond vibration of the carboxylic function of go or h2o adsorbed on the surface of ggo and go the strong band at 1626 cm 1 is ascribed to co stretching bond of the carboxylic function in addition oco and cc vibrations were observed in ggo at 1377 and 1515 cm 1 respectively the ft ir spectrum confirmed that the prepared ggo was oxygen rich containing functions that facilitate to efficient remediation of heavy metal contaminated water to investigate the texture and crystalline nature of ggo xrd pattern fig 2b was used in this study the diffraction peaks at 2θ 28 0 and 32 6 represent the 2 2 2 and 4 0 0 lattice planes of gd2o3 jcpds 43 1015 respectively confirming that the synthesized ggo contained cubic gd2o3 nanoparticles 26 the diffraction peak at 10 associated with 0 0 2 plane is a typical feature for go thus the xrd pattern proves the crystalline nature and presence of gd2o3 on go the average crystalline size of ggo was found to be 200 nm as measured by the scherrer equation 27 the magnetic properties of ggo were conducted using a magnetic property measurement system mpms and the results are shown in fig 2c d it is fact the magnetization of the material varies with the particle dimension that depends on the temperature of the precursor hence the mpms studies were conducted at different magnetic field values t range 80 000 80 000 oe at 5 k and 300 k fig 2c and d a plot at 300 k ascribed that the ggo is paramagnetic that caused to the seven unpaired electrons in the 4f orbital of gd2o3 27 28 however the plot at 5 k exhibited 0 0081 emu g of maximum magnetization indicating the ggo is superparamagnetic gd2o3 is known to exhibit ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetic below 293 k 29 30 hence the prepared material exhibited paramagnetic at 300 k and superparamagnetic at 5 k that is enough to facilitate the ggo phase separation by an external magnetic field indeed the samples were separated within 2 min under hgms in this study xps was used to investigate the chemical compositions of ggo in fig 2e in addition to c 1s and o 1s peaks attributable to go observed broad peaks at 141 27 and 1185 54 ev that correspond to gd 4d and gd 3d from gd2o3 the deconvolution xps of carbon and oxygen are shown in fig 2f g the o 1s peak represents nearly equal binding energies at approximately 531 5 0 2 ev for varying take off angles associated with gd o 31 these data show that gd2o3 was successfully introduced onto the graphene surface brunauer emmett teller bet surface analysis table s2 found to be 68 8 m2 g of a surface area for ggo the pore volume of 0 22 cm3 g and an average pore diameter of 17 15 nm for the as prepared ggo thus the prepared crystalline ggo possesses a mesoporous surface the bet surface area of ggo was higher than those of go iron oxide doped go and graphite indicating its lower aggregation tendency especially compared to iron oxide doped go hence ggo can provide higher adsorptive efficacy and easier separation than iron oxide doped go fig 3 shows the images for sem edx and tem analyses the sem image reveals a cloud like morphology these flocs are composed of small particles that roughen the surface and increase the specific surface area fig 3a fig 3b indicates the elemental composition of ggo obtained in the yellow circle of fig 3a the main elements are carbon and oxygen which are considered to mainly come from graphene the surface also contains 24 02 gd plus a small amount of na that may come from naoh used for ph adjustment in the tem image fig 3c the ggo appear nearly transparent with several small sphered gd2o3 uniformaly loaded on go sheet it is also observed that the sphere shaped gd2o3 particles emboded on go interlayer with little aggregation due to magnetic property of gd2o3 that will be expected 22 32 3 2 effect of experiemntal conditions on ggo adsorption efficiency ph is one of the important factor to understand the efficacy of adsorbent for water treatment here tested the effect of ph 2 0 10 0 on the adsorptive uptake of both metal ions 10 mg l by ggo 0 5 g l fig 4 a fig 4a shows the uptake of both metal ions slowly increased and was reached over 97 for ph 4 0 and this may be due to the competition between h and metal ions deceased as increased ph 4 0 for adsorbent surface sites and it ws high at lower ph 4 0 that leads to lower adsorption however when ph 8 0 the pb ii ions precipitate as hydroxides pb oh while cr iii exists as cr oh 2 and cr oh 2 even above ph 4 0 indicated as in fig 4a thus ph 4 0 was selected as the optimal condition for further studies moreover the adsorption process was not influenced surface charge it was clearly understanding form phzpc of adsorbent is 8 1 even at ph 4 0 phzpc 8 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was found this results indicates the adsorption process was mainly due to surface complexation rather than electrostatic interaction 32 fig 4b shows a rapid increase in adsorptive removal when the initial dosage is increased from 0 1 to 0 5 g l at higher adsorbent doses 0 5 g l the removal rate curve was plateau with an average value of 96 4 for both metal ions however a higher adsorbent dosage decreased the adsorption capacity per specific area of adsorbent due to the decreased available surface area of the aggregated adsorbent since there are invariably other ions in actual water samples groundwater surface water or industrial effluents it is need to evaluate the effect of coexisting ions and the ionic strength on the adsorptive removal of target pollutants in practical applications moreover heavy metal contaminants can easily change their chemical forms by interacting with other anions or cations fig 4c d describes the effect of various cations and anions on the uptake of pb ii and cr iii most of the investigated ions including na mg2 no3 po4 2 and so4 2 show no significant effect on both metal ions removal nevertheless co3 2 significantly suppresses the adsorptive removal of cr iii which might be due to the inner sphere surface complexation between the metal and ggo 33 since carbonate is the main anion in water the application of ggo for adsorption might be difficult in carbonate rich groundwater the rate of adsorption of pb ii decreases slightly in the presence of k and ca2 although the effect is weak since the pb ii removal rate remains higher than 85 thus as prepared ggo can be potentially applied for the adsorptive removal of cr iii and pb ii from environmental water samples 3 3 adsorption kinetics instead of actual physical models of the sorption kinetics here employed pseudo first order pfo eq 3 pseudo second order pso eq 4 and elovich eq 5 equations were applied to the kinetic data to understand its kinetics mechanism 3 q t q e 1 e k p f o t 4 q t k p s o q e 2 t 1 k p s o q e t 5 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t here qe mg g and qt mg g are the uptake capacities at equilibrium and at time t min and kpfo and kpso are the kinetic rate constants for pfo and pso models respectively α and β are the elovich kinetic parameters the kinetic models fitting results are shown in fig 4e f and the calculated parameters are reported in table s3 from fig 4e f and table s3 the pso model is more suitable for describing the kinetic data than the other two models based on the correlation coefficients r2 0 970 that are very close to 1 for both metal ions furthermore there is a close concurrence at the experimentally measured qe exp and qe of the pso model these results suggest that the removal of pb ii and cr iii by the ggo is rate limited by pso kinetics the overall kinetic results suggest that the rate limiting step necessitate valence forces through the sharing or exchange of electrons between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 3 4 adsorption isotherms isotherms can describe the interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate which are the most important parameters in designing the adsorption process to identify these interactions three different isotherm models were applied to the adsorption equilibrium data the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm equations are provided in eqs 6 7 and 8 respectively fig s1 shows the linear fitting using each isotherm model each model makes specific assumptions about the interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate the langmuir model tells the monolayer adsorption of metal ion on the outer surface of the ggo after which no further adsorption occurs therefore this model represents the metal ions distribution at the solid and liquid phases equilibrium the linear form of the langmuir equation is 6 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where kl is the langmuir isotherm constant and qm is the maximum capacity of the langmuir equation and a considerable factor compared with other materials also the freundlich model assumes a heterogeneous adsorption mechanism and it can be described the linear eq 7 7 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where n is the adsorption intensity and kf is the freundlich isotherm constant physically kf provides an approximation of the adsorption capacity while 1 n describes the adsorption strength the range of n 1 suggests suitable adsorption conditions the langmuir and freundlich models do not consider thermodynamic factors that are dependent on temperature in contrast temkin model is described by a thermodynamic isotherm equation 8 q e r t b ln k t r t b ln c e where b is the temkin isotherm constant and kt is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant r 8 314 j mol k is the universal gas constant and the experimental temperature for each isotherm is applied individually the calculated isotherm parameters are reported in table 1 the langmuir adsorption model achieves a high r2 0 99 for cr iii indicating good description of the experimental data the predicted maximum adsorption capacity of ggo for cr iii is 17 97 mg g and it increases with increasing temperature on the other hand pb ii adsorption isotherm data could be well explained by either langmuir and freundlich isotherm models both with r2 0 98 thus the exact isothermal interactions between ggo and pb ii is difficult to establish from these results both langmuir and freundlich models demonstrate that the adsorption occurs in monolayers and the adsorption dimensionless constants n and kl achieved a favorable limit hence both monolayer homogeneous and multilayer heterogeneous adsorption are possible however increases the adsorption capacity with system temperature increases the maximum uptake capacity of ggo for pb ii is 83 04 mg g according to the langmuir equation also compares the present maximum adsorption capacity of ggo with other reported similar materials table 2 for cr iii and pb ii removal this results found that the maximum adsorption capacity of ggo for both cr iii and pb ii was comparable near or more the agreement with literature values further supports the reliability and feasibility of ggo for removing cr iii and pb ii from contaminated water 3 5 thermodynamic analysis the thermodynamic study was conducted to investigate the influence of temperature enthalpy and gibbs free energy on the adsorption performance these thermodynamic parameters were evaluated using 9 δ g r t l n k d 10 δ g δ h t δ s where kd is the distribution constant defined as 11 k d c a d c e here δg kj mol indicates the change of gibbs free energy r indicates universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t k is the temperature δs j mol k is the change in entropy and δh kj mol is the change in enthalpy the thermodynamic parameters obtained from eqs 9 11 are shown in table s4 and fig s2 from table s4 when the temperature increases δg of adsorption decreases slightly the fact that δh 0 for both metal ions suggests that the adsorption process is endothermic cr iii shows a high δh value of 201 6 kj mol implying that its adsorption involves chemical complexation while the very low δh value for pb ii approximately 7 16 kj mol means that its adsorption proceeds through physical electrostatic interactions this trend was also observed in the isotherm data where cr iii follows only the langmuir isotherm and pb ii follows both langmuir and freundlich isotherms positive values of δs were obtained for cr iii and pb ii suggesting increasing of randomness at the solid solution interface that leads to good affinity to adsorption of cr iii and pb ii with ggo 3 6 application to field samples the adsorption efficiency of ggo in surface wastewater for cr iii and pb ii removal is shown in fig 4g cr iii was completely removed with approximately 100 efficiency at all initial concentrations 2 5 20 mg l while the remediation rate of pb ii suppressed to 70 from 95 as the initial concentration increased this can be attributed to the interference of co existing ions in the surface wastewater table s1 as confirmed by the results in fig 4d nevertheless the adsorption removal rates of pb ii remained higher than 70 suggesting potential applicability in wastewater treatment 3 7 re usability in batch studies fig 4h indicates the the re usability of ggo was carried out using 0 1 m hno3 as a desorbing agent the synthetic water contain 20 mg l at ph 4 0 was used for both metal ion loading on ggo the obtained results concluded that the adsorption capacity decreased as increasing number of adsorption and desorption cycles however as prepared ggo can be re used for more than 3 cycles with an average adsorption removal capacity of 13 mg g for cr iii and 15 mg g for pb ii it is aslo abserved the adsorption capacity of cr iii is less than that pb ii which contrast in the case of real water system this is due to co existing ions k and mg2 effect in real water that are significantly effect in pb ii removal fig 4d where in the case of cr iii those ions are negible effect except co3 2 which is not available in real water thus this results indicate that the adsorbent can sucesfully re use up to 3 cycles with out loss of its efficacy less than 13 mg g for both metal ions 3 8 adsorption mechanism the xps data of ggo after metal ion adsorption are shown in fig 5 a c the convoluted c 1s spectrum of pristine ggo displayed three sub peaks at 284 07 cc 287 93 co and 285 22 ev co fig 4f these peaks were shifted to 284 19 287 97 and 285 48 ev after loading cr iii and to 284 23 288 09 and 285 52 ev after loading pb ii respectively fig 5b however there was only a small change in the shape of the c 1s peak indicating that the dominant c skeleton structure was stable moreover after cr iii and pb ii adsorbed at ggo surface the peaks of gd 4d and gd 3d shifted to 142 50 and 1186 70 ev respectively 41 the convoluted o 1s peaks can be split into three peaks at 530 02 co 532 16 co and 530 08 ev gdo fig 4g which were shifted to 532 72 532 12 and 531 23 ev for cr iii adsorption and to 529 89 532 36 and 530 92 ev for pb ii adsorption respectively fig 5c these results indicate that the oxygen in rich functional groups are likely intricatein the metal ions uptaking process by ggo taking into the account of the ph dependence isotherms kinetic and thermodynamic parameters conclude that the cr iii uptake process on ggo consists of complexation at the surface functional groups while pb ii becomes adsorbed through both electrostatic and surface complexation on the other hand the co existing ion results indicate that the adsorption was carried out through ion exchange along with surface complexation and electrostatic interaction further the inner sphere diffusion complexation mechanism was confirmed fig 5d e because the adsorption data of both pb ii and cr iii under ph variation were well fitted with the 2 pka dlm based on all the results proposed the plausible adsorption mechanism schematically represented in fig 6 which features surface complexation along with ion exchange and electrostatic interaction 3 9 column studies under electromagnetic field the magnetic properties of ggo imply that it may benefit from magnetic separation the separation operation employed a vessel tubes and pumps the schematic set up of column studies under electromagnetic field was shown in fig s3 the two initial solutions containing cr iii and pb ii were prepared at ph 4 0 with collected real surface water the cycle of separation was repeated at least five times using the same adsorbent amount and flow velocity 60 ml min for both metal ions fig 6b plots the removal and recovery rate for each metal ion in the first cycle less than 0 1 mg l of cr iii was flow out which is below than the drinking water standard usepa however the removal rate declined dramatically in subsequent cycles in the third cycle the removal of cr iii was under 40 and in the fourth cycle pb ii removal reached a low level these data show that the adsorption capacity and reusability are almost at the maximum under hgms since the goal of magnetic separation and reusing of the adsorbent material the recovery rate is shown on the right axis fig 7 the material recovery was more than 90 in the first batch and decreased slightly near to 60 and 80 in the fifth batch of cr iii and pb ii adsorption process respectively particle aggregation occurs in the following cycles and the resultant large particles have a lower magnetic property that may cause difficulty in the recovery of the adsorbent thus particle aggregation and the reduction of magnetic strength are caused for the low recovery rate of adsorbent on magnetic separation 4 conclusions this study described a facile method for synthesizing gadolinium oxide doped graphene oxide ggo for potential adsorptive removal of cr iii and pb ii from water the prepared ggo was well characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques characterization results revealed that the prepared compound was highly crystalline with a particle size of approximately 200 nm and the specific surface area of 68 9 m2 g is higher than those of graphite go and fe3o4 go it was found that the adsorption is affected by ph adsorbent dosage equilibration time and temperature and concluded the optimum conditions are ph 4 0 0 5 g l ggo and 180 min equilibrium time for maximum adsorption of both metal ions the kinectis and isotherm model fitting studies concluded that the adsorption process was monolyer rate limiting kinetics on homogeneous surface of ggo for cr iii in contrast the isotherms for pb ii followed both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models indicating that pb ii adsorption follows both chemical and physical sorption which is further confirmed by a higher change in enthalpy the maximum adsorption capacities of pb ii and cr iii are 83 04 and 17 97 mg g respectively which are comparable to the other materials reported table 2 this study also concluded that the doping of gd2o3 to go could enhance the adsorption capacity as prepared ggo can be re used for more than 3 cycles with an average adsorption removal capacity of 13 mg g for cr iii and 15 mg g for pb ii further the deconvoluted xps spectrum and overall batch studies conclude that the adsorption of both metal ions mainly occurs through surface complexation in addition to ion exchange and electrostatic interaction finally when used in actual groundwater samples ggo has an ability to reduce the pb ii and cr iii contents to within the maximum contaminant level in the us epa standards therefore the prepared ggo may be a promising adsorbent for remediating heavy metal pollution in groundwater or other aquatic systems this promising hybrid adsorbent should be further investigated for both academic research and application purposes author contributions l p lingamdinne j r koduru and y y chang conceived and designed the

dispersibility 11 to address this issue researchers have been modified or prepared hybrid go composites for water treatment recently amino silanes 12 diethylenetriamine deta 13 mn doped tio2 14 and lanthanum 15 were used to modify go to increase its adsorption capacity for heavy metal removal and recovery efficiency for example go was combined with iron oxide as fe3o4 to allow the collection of nano sized adsorbent particles using a magnet 16 17 in another study a magnetic cyclic dextrin was attached to the go surface for removing heavy metals 18 go modified by magnetic metal oxides was

gd2o3 to modify go can allow easy recycling of the adsorbent under a strong applied magnetic field taking that results into account herein ggo as a practical adsorbent in addition to its magnetic

for pb removal moreover ggo can be reused up to three cycles with more than 75 removal capacity for both metal ions inaddition the obtained maximum adsorption capacity of ggo for both metal ions are comparable with various reported adsorbent materials this study may provide a conclusion that the synthesized material ggo not only facile for phase separation but also stable that can use for many cycles with minium removal capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of ggo information about the materials and characterization instrument can be found in supplementary materials go was synthesized using hummers method 25 from graphite for producing the ggo composite as shown in fig 1 go 1 g was dispersed in water and then gd no3 3 solution 5 g in 20 ml demineralized water was added

the total volume of solution co and ce are the initial and equilibrium metal concentrations respectively and m g is the weight of ggo the removal rate is used to compare material efficiency and

with the collected real surface water 2 4 diffusion layer modeling 2 pka dlm the visual minteq 3 0 software was used to apply the diffuse layer model dlm for the estimation of the surface charge effects and mechanism of ggo for model prediction the surface charge density ns of ggo was measured from the surface area 68 8 m2 g and pka values obtained from acid base titration data that gave ns 1 2 10 5 mol g 2 5 column studies aided by the electromagnetic field effective separation of the powdery ggo composite was tested using high gradient magnetic separation hgms by mounting a ferromagnetic material and inducing a high magnetic gradient around it hgms can change the flow of magnetic fluids and increase the separation efficiency of magnetic materials here the electromagnet jl magnet korea was wounded with coils and designed for insertion into a glass column length 180 mm diameter 18 mm before run it the glass column was filled with steel wool fine grade aisi 434 stainless steel wool to induce a strong magnetic field with a high gradient the above metal spiked real surface water used for this column studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 ggo characterization the structure and functional groups of an adsorbent influence its properties the ft ir spectrum of ggo is shown in fig 2 a the peak at 591 cm 1 is indicating to gdo vibration at gd2o3 the broadband observed at approximately 3411 cm 1 is ascribed to oh bond vibration of the carboxylic function of go or h2o adsorbed on the surface of ggo and go the strong band at 1626 cm 1 is ascribed to co stretching bond of the carboxylic function in addition oco and cc vibrations were observed in ggo at 1377 and 1515 cm 1 respectively the ft ir spectrum confirmed that the prepared ggo was oxygen rich containing functions that facilitate to efficient remediation of heavy metal contaminated water to investigate the texture and crystalline nature of ggo xrd pattern fig 2b was used in this study the diffraction peaks at 2θ 28 0 and 32 6 represent the 2 2 2 and 4 0 0 lattice planes of gd2o3 jcpds 43 1015 respectively confirming that the synthesized ggo contained cubic gd2o3 nanoparticles 26 the diffraction peak at 10 associated with 0 0 2 plane is a typical feature for go thus the xrd pattern proves the crystalline nature and presence of gd2o3 on go the average crystalline size of ggo was found to be 200 nm as measured by the scherrer equation 27 the magnetic properties of ggo were conducted using a magnetic property measurement system mpms and the results are shown in fig 2c d it is fact the magnetization of the material varies with the particle dimension that depends on the temperature of the precursor hence the mpms studies were conducted at different magnetic field values t range 80 000 80 000 oe at 5 k and 300 k fig 2c and d a plot at 300 k ascribed that the ggo is paramagnetic that caused to the seven unpaired electrons in the 4f orbital of gd2o3 27 28 however the plot at 5 k exhibited 0 0081 emu g of maximum magnetization indicating the ggo is superparamagnetic gd2o3 is known to exhibit ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetic below 293 k 29 30 hence the prepared material exhibited paramagnetic at 300 k and superparamagnetic at 5 k that is enough to facilitate the ggo phase separation by an external magnetic field indeed the samples were separated within 2 min under hgms in this study xps was used to investigate the chemical compositions of ggo in fig 2e in addition to c 1s and o 1s peaks attributable to go observed broad peaks at 141 27 and 1185 54 ev that correspond to gd 4d and gd 3d from gd2o3 the deconvolution xps of carbon and oxygen are shown in fig 2f g the o 1s peak represents nearly equal binding energies at approximately 531 5 0 2 ev for varying take off angles associated with gd o 31 these data show that gd2o3 was successfully introduced onto the graphene surface brunauer emmett teller bet surface analysis table s2 found to be 68 8 m2 g of a surface area for ggo the pore volume of 0 22 cm3 g and an average pore diameter of 17 15 nm for the as prepared ggo thus the prepared crystalline ggo possesses a mesoporous surface the bet surface area of ggo was higher than those of go iron oxide doped go and graphite indicating its lower aggregation tendency especially compared to iron oxide doped go hence ggo can provide higher adsorptive efficacy and easier separation than iron oxide doped go fig 3 shows the images for sem edx and tem analyses the sem image reveals a cloud like morphology these flocs are composed of small particles that roughen the surface and increase the specific surface area fig 3a fig 3b indicates the elemental composition of ggo obtained in the yellow circle of fig 3a the main elements are carbon and oxygen which are considered to mainly come from graphene the surface also contains 24 02 gd plus a small amount of na that may come from naoh used for ph adjustment in the tem image fig 3c the ggo appear nearly transparent with several small sphered gd2o3 uniformaly loaded on go sheet it is also observed that the sphere shaped gd2o3 particles emboded on go interlayer with little aggregation due to magnetic property of gd2o3 that will be expected 22 32 3 2 effect of experiemntal conditions on ggo adsorption efficiency ph is one of the important factor to understand the efficacy of adsorbent for water treatment here tested the effect of ph 2 0 10 0 on the adsorptive uptake of both metal ions 10 mg l by ggo 0 5 g l fig 4 a fig 4a shows the uptake of both metal ions slowly increased and was reached over 97 for ph 4 0 and this may be due to the competition between h and metal ions deceased as increased ph 4 0 for adsorbent surface sites and it ws high at lower ph 4 0 that leads to lower adsorption however when ph 8 0 the pb ii ions precipitate as hydroxides pb oh while cr iii exists as cr oh 2 and cr oh 2 even above ph 4 0 indicated as in fig 4a thus ph 4 0 was selected as the optimal condition for further studies moreover the adsorption process was not influenced surface charge it was clearly understanding form phzpc of adsorbent is 8 1 even at ph 4 0 phzpc 8 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was found this results indicates the adsorption process was mainly due to surface complexation rather than electrostatic interaction 32 fig 4b shows a rapid increase in adsorptive removal when the initial dosage is increased from 0 1 to 0 5 g l at higher adsorbent doses 0 5 g l the removal rate curve was plateau with an average value of 96 4 for both metal ions however a higher adsorbent dosage decreased the adsorption capacity per specific area of adsorbent due to the decreased available surface area of the aggregated adsorbent since there are invariably other ions in actual water samples groundwater surface water or industrial effluents it is need to evaluate the effect of coexisting ions and the ionic strength on the adsorptive removal of target pollutants in practical applications moreover heavy metal contaminants can easily change their chemical forms by interacting with other anions or cations fig 4c d describes the effect of various cations and anions on the uptake of pb ii and cr iii most of the investigated ions including na mg2 no3 po4 2 and so4 2 show no significant effect on both metal ions removal nevertheless co3 2 significantly suppresses the adsorptive removal of cr iii which might be due to the inner sphere surface complexation between the metal and ggo 33 since carbonate is the main anion in water the application of ggo for adsorption might be difficult in carbonate rich groundwater the rate of adsorption of pb ii decreases slightly in the presence of k and ca2 although the effect is weak since the pb ii removal rate remains higher than 85 thus as prepared ggo can be potentially applied for the adsorptive removal of cr iii and pb ii from environmental water samples 3 3 adsorption kinetics instead of actual physical models of the sorption kinetics here employed pseudo first order pfo eq 3 pseudo second order pso eq 4 and elovich eq 5 equations were applied to the kinetic data to understand its kinetics mechanism 3 q t q e 1 e k p f o t 4 q t k p s o q e 2 t 1 k p s o q e t 5 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t here qe mg g and qt mg g are the uptake capacities at equilibrium and at time t min and kpfo and kpso are the kinetic rate constants for pfo and pso models respectively α and β are the elovich kinetic parameters the kinetic models fitting results are shown in fig 4e f and the calculated parameters are reported in table s3 from fig 4e f and table s3 the pso model is more suitable for describing the kinetic data than the other two models based on the correlation coefficients r2 0 970 that are very close to 1 for both metal ions furthermore there is a close concurrence at the experimentally measured qe exp and qe of the pso model these results suggest that the removal of pb ii and cr iii by the ggo is rate limited by pso kinetics the overall kinetic results suggest that the rate limiting step necessitate valence forces through the sharing or exchange of electrons between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 3 4 adsorption isotherms isotherms can describe the interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate which are the most important parameters in designing the adsorption process to identify these interactions three different isotherm models were applied to the adsorption equilibrium data the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm equations are provided in eqs 6 7 and 8 respectively fig s1 shows the linear fitting using each isotherm model each model makes specific assumptions about the interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate the langmuir model tells the monolayer adsorption of metal ion on the outer surface of the ggo after which no further adsorption occurs therefore this model represents the metal ions distribution at the solid and liquid phases equilibrium the linear form of the langmuir equation is 6 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where kl is the langmuir isotherm constant and qm is the maximum capacity of the langmuir equation and a considerable factor compared with other materials also the freundlich model assumes a heterogeneous adsorption mechanism and it can be described the linear eq 7 7 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where n is the adsorption intensity and kf is the freundlich isotherm constant physically kf provides an approximation of the adsorption capacity while 1 n describes the adsorption strength the range of n 1 suggests suitable adsorption conditions the langmuir and freundlich models do not consider thermodynamic factors that are dependent on temperature in contrast temkin model is described by a thermodynamic isotherm equation 8 q e r t b ln k t r t b ln c e where b is the temkin isotherm constant and kt is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant r 8 314 j mol k is the universal gas constant and the experimental temperature for each isotherm is applied individually the calculated isotherm parameters are reported in table 1 the langmuir adsorption model achieves a high r2 0 99 for cr iii indicating good description of the experimental data the predicted maximum adsorption capacity of ggo for cr iii is 17 97 mg g and it increases with increasing temperature on the other hand pb ii adsorption isotherm data could be well explained by either langmuir and freundlich isotherm models both with r2 0 98 thus the exact isothermal interactions between ggo and pb ii is difficult to establish from these results both langmuir and freundlich models demonstrate that the adsorption occurs in monolayers and the adsorption dimensionless constants n and kl achieved a favorable limit hence both monolayer homogeneous and multilayer heterogeneous adsorption are possible however increases the adsorption capacity with system temperature increases the maximum uptake capacity of ggo for pb ii is 83 04 mg g according to the langmuir equation also compares the present maximum adsorption capacity of ggo with other reported similar materials table 2 for cr iii and pb ii removal this results found that the maximum adsorption capacity of ggo for both cr iii and pb ii was comparable near or more the agreement with literature values further supports the reliability and feasibility of ggo for removing cr iii and pb ii from contaminated water 3 5 thermodynamic analysis the thermodynamic study was conducted to investigate the influence of temperature enthalpy and gibbs free energy on the adsorption performance these thermodynamic parameters were evaluated using 9 δ g r t l n k d 10 δ g δ h t δ s where kd is the distribution constant defined as 11 k d c a d c e here δg kj mol indicates the change of gibbs free energy r indicates universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t k is the temperature δs j mol k is the change in entropy and δh kj mol is the change in enthalpy the thermodynamic parameters obtained from eqs 9 11 are shown in table s4 and fig s2 from table s4 when the temperature increases δg of adsorption decreases slightly the fact that δh 0 for both metal ions suggests that the adsorption process is endothermic cr iii shows a high δh value of 201 6 kj mol implying that its adsorption involves chemical complexation while the very low δh value for pb ii approximately 7 16 kj mol means that its adsorption proceeds through physical electrostatic interactions this trend was also observed in the isotherm data where cr iii follows only the langmuir isotherm and pb ii follows both langmuir and freundlich isotherms positive values of δs were obtained for cr iii and pb ii suggesting increasing of randomness at the solid solution interface that leads to good affinity to adsorption of cr iii and pb ii with ggo 3 6 application to field samples the adsorption efficiency of ggo in surface wastewater for cr iii and pb ii removal is shown in fig 4g cr iii was completely removed with approximately 100 efficiency at all initial concentrations 2 5 20 mg l while the remediation rate of pb ii suppressed to 70 from 95 as the initial concentration increased this can be attributed to the interference of co existing ions in the surface wastewater table s1 as confirmed by the results in fig 4d nevertheless the adsorption removal rates of pb ii remained higher than 70 suggesting potential applicability in wastewater treatment 3 7 re usability in batch studies fig 4h indicates the the re usability of ggo was carried out using 0 1 m hno3 as a desorbing agent the synthetic water contain 20 mg l at ph 4 0 was used for both metal ion loading on ggo the obtained results concluded that the adsorption capacity decreased as increasing number of adsorption and desorption cycles however as prepared ggo can be re used for more than 3 cycles with an average adsorption removal capacity of 13 mg g for cr iii and 15 mg g for pb ii it is aslo abserved the adsorption capacity of cr iii is less than that pb ii which contrast in the case of real water system this is due to co existing ions k and mg2 effect in real water that are significantly effect in pb ii removal fig 4d where in the case of cr iii those ions are negible effect except co3 2 which is not available in real water thus this results indicate that the adsorbent can sucesfully re use up to 3 cycles with out loss of its efficacy less than 13 mg g for both metal ions 3 8 adsorption mechanism the xps data of ggo after metal ion adsorption are shown in fig 5 a c the convoluted c 1s spectrum of pristine ggo displayed three sub peaks at 284 07 cc 287 93 co and 285 22 ev co fig 4f these peaks were shifted to 284 19 287 97 and 285 48 ev after loading cr iii and to 284 23 288 09 and 285 52 ev after loading pb ii respectively fig 5b however there was only a small change in the shape of the c 1s peak indicating that the dominant c skeleton structure was stable moreover after cr iii and pb ii adsorbed at ggo surface the peaks of gd 4d and gd 3d shifted to 142 50 and 1186 70 ev respectively 41 the convoluted o 1s peaks can be split into three peaks at 530 02 co 532 16 co and 530 08 ev gdo fig 4g which were shifted to 532 72 532 12 and 531 23 ev for cr iii adsorption and to 529 89 532 36 and 530 92 ev for pb ii adsorption respectively fig 5c these results indicate that the oxygen in rich functional groups are likely intricatein the metal ions uptaking process by ggo taking into the account of the ph dependence isotherms kinetic and thermodynamic parameters conclude that the cr iii uptake process on ggo consists of complexation at the surface functional groups while pb ii becomes adsorbed through both electrostatic and surface complexation on the other hand the co existing ion results indicate that the adsorption was carried out through ion exchange along with surface complexation and electrostatic interaction further the inner sphere diffusion complexation mechanism was confirmed fig 5d e because the adsorption data of both pb ii and cr iii under ph variation were well fitted with the 2 pka dlm based on all the results proposed the plausible adsorption mechanism schematically represented in fig 6 which features surface complexation along with ion exchange and electrostatic interaction 3 9 column studies under electromagnetic field the magnetic properties of ggo imply that it may benefit from magnetic separation the separation operation employed a vessel tubes and pumps the schematic set up of column studies under electromagnetic field was shown in fig s3 the two initial solutions containing cr iii and pb ii were prepared at ph 4 0 with collected real surface water the cycle of separation was repeated at least five times using the same adsorbent amount and flow velocity 60 ml min for both metal ions fig 6b plots the removal and recovery rate for each metal ion in the first cycle less than 0 1 mg l of cr iii was flow out which is below than the drinking water standard usepa however the removal rate declined dramatically in subsequent cycles in the third cycle the removal of cr iii was under 40 and in the fourth cycle pb ii removal reached a low level these data show that the adsorption capacity and reusability are almost at the maximum under hgms since the goal of magnetic separation and reusing of the adsorbent material the recovery rate is shown on the right axis fig 7 the material recovery was more than 90 in the first batch and decreased slightly near to 60 and 80 in the fifth batch of cr iii and pb ii adsorption process respectively particle aggregation occurs in the following cycles and the resultant large particles have a lower magnetic property that may cause difficulty in the recovery of the adsorbent thus particle aggregation and the reduction of magnetic strength are caused for the low recovery rate of adsorbent on magnetic separation 4 conclusions this study described a facile method for synthesizing gadolinium oxide doped graphene oxide ggo for potential adsorptive removal of cr iii and pb ii from water the prepared ggo was well characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques characterization results revealed that the prepared compound was highly crystalline with a particle size of approximately 200 nm and the specific surface area of 68 9 m2 g is higher than those of graphite go and fe3o4 go it was found that the adsorption is affected by ph adsorbent dosage equilibration time and temperature and concluded the optimum conditions are ph 4 0 0 5 g l ggo and 180 min equilibrium time for maximum adsorption of both metal ions the kinectis and isotherm model fitting studies concluded that the adsorption process was monolyer rate limiting kinetics on homogeneous surface of ggo for cr iii in contrast the isotherms for pb ii followed both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models indicating that pb ii adsorption follows both chemical and physical sorption which is further confirmed by a higher change in enthalpy the maximum adsorption capacities of pb ii and cr iii are 83 04 and 17 97 mg g respectively which are comparable to the other materials reported table 2 this study also concluded that the doping of gd2o3 to go could enhance the adsorption capacity as prepared ggo can be re used for more than 3 cycles with an average adsorption removal capacity of 13 mg g for cr iii and 15 mg g for pb ii further the deconvoluted xps spectrum and overall batch studies conclude that the adsorption of both metal ions mainly occurs through surface complexation in addition to ion exchange and electrostatic interaction finally when used in actual groundwater samples ggo has an ability to reduce the pb ii and cr iii contents to within the maximum contaminant level in the us epa standards therefore the prepared ggo may be a promising adsorbent for remediating heavy metal pollution in groundwater or other aquatic systems this promising hybrid adsorbent should be further investigated for both academic research and application purposes author contributions l p lingamdinne j r koduru and y y chang conceived and designed the

13581,in this work copper oxide nanorods cu2o nrs were directly prepared from copper sheet as substrate the as grown cu2o nrs were modified through surface carbon layer deposition via a single step thermal treatment method the carbon modified cu2o nrs has been characterized by scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersion x ray spectroscopy edx x ray diffraction xrd thermogravimetric analysis tga x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps furrier transform infrared ft ir and raman spectroscopy the results showed that cu2o nrs were formed on the surface of the metal sheet as non aligned rods with a diameter of 100 130 nm and 1 5 2 5 μm length the produced reactive species oh in the photocatalytic experiments was detected and quantified by coumarin as a probe furthermore the inactivation of e coli bacteria was explored as a model for antimicrobial performance tannic acid was used as a model of nom the carbon modified cu2o nrs showed an enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance for nom at the end of photocatalytic experiments 99 of tannic acid and 93 of cod removal were obtained also complete inactivation of e coli bacteria is achieved the results indicated that cu2o nrs in a modified form could be used for five cycles of photocatalytic degradation keywords cu2o nanorods disinfection dissolved organic matter solar radiation photocatalyst 1 introduction disinfection is the final ultimate stage of drinking water treatment and production it commonly influences the quality of the final water product generally chlorine chloramines and chlorine dioxide are used in water treatment to inactivate microorganisms free chlorination is the common disinfectant technique practiced in egypt and other parts of the world the main drawback of this approach is the consequent formation of inorganic and organic disinfection byproducts dbb s 1 alternative methods including ozonation and ultraviolet radiation have also been employed in the disinfection of water worldwide however these latter methods have disadvantages in that they require expensive chemicals and or costly equipment to trigger the disinfection process nanoparticles have been used as disinfectants silver magnesium oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles are efficient for disinfectants and removing organic pollutants 2 3 the disinfection capabilities of the nanoparticles depend mainly on the direct interaction and collisions between microorganism cell membranes and nanoparticles 4 applying this technology to drinking water disinfection requires nano filters to ultimately remove the nanoparticles after disinfection as they may constitute toxins if their levels in the final water product are high this may increase the expense of the method natural organic matter nom is present in the soil water and sediments nom in water is derived from the breakdown of plants and is also associated with bacteria algae and aquatic plants natural sources of drinking water generally contain nom as a result of water soil interactions within the hydrologic cycle the biosphere and geosphere 5 nom is considered a mixture of complex heterogeneous organic compounds such as the humic substances humic acid fulvic acid humans and tannic acid polysaccharides amino sugars proteins peptides lipids and minor hydrophilic acids etc 5 dissolved humic materials represent more than 90 of dissolved organic carbon in drinking water 6 the portion of nom that passes through a 0 45 μm filter is the dissolved component and is considered as the dissolved natural organic matter dnom dnom is the most challenging form of nom to manage concerning drinking water treatment 7 dnom raises problems in the production of drinking water as dnom is a cause of taste odor and coloration of raw drinking water 8 and is considered as a source of carbon nutrients and energy for bacteria dnom reacts with chlorine chloramine and chlorine oxide which used for water disinfection to produce halogenated disinfection byproducts organic dbb s such as trichloroethanes chloroacetic acid chloroacetonitriles haloketones chloroaldehydes and chlorofuranones which are carcinogenic compounds even in trace quantities 9 dnom also promotes biological growths in the water distribution system 10 many technologies have been adapted to eliminate dnom from drinking water 11 dnom has been removed from water by coagulation electrochemical methods membranes adsorption ion exchange bio filtration 12 13 uv chlorine oxidation 14 and advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation process systems include o3 h2o2 o3 uv uv h2o2 tio2 uv h2o2 catalyst fenton photo fenton processes and ultrasound 15 16 generally advanced oxidation processes produce oxygen radicals oh or o2 that attack the dnom at the rich electron sites leading to breakdown and mineralization to form carbon dioxide and water the oh radical is one of the most powerful known oxidants the reaction rates of the oh radicals with nom compounds are usually several orders of magnitude higher than those achieved using molecular ozone under the same conditions the oxidation potentials of oh are 2 86 ev higher than for ozone which is 2 42 ev 17 the reaction rate constants between oh and organic species are in the range of 108 1010 m 1 s 1 18 oh radicals are highly nonselective oxidants enabling a very large number of reactants the reactions of oh radicals with nom proceeds in three different ways i by the addition of oh to double bonds ii by h atom abstraction which yields carbon centered radicals and iii by the oh gaining an electron from an organic substituent to date few investigations have been conducted to assess the efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection powered by solar energy 19 22 numerous photocatalysts have been used to generate oh radicals for the deactivation of microorganism and water disinfection 23 titanium and graphene ag and agi doped with bi and many semiconductors have been applied to disinfect water 24 25 cu2o is a low cost and non toxic semiconductor material with a narrow band gap that can be prepared in many forms and used as a visible light driven photo catalyst it is may be prepared in such forms as conventional and hierarchical nanocubes 26 nanoparticle composite materials with graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 27 ag 28 graphene 29 and cu2o core shells 26 recently cu2o nrs were synthesized for use in the visible light driven photo catalysis of co2 reduction and drinking water disinfection 30 also cu2o in nanowires form decorated with silver nanoparticles was used for inactivation of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus from drinking water 31 previously photocatalysts were used in a powder form in water treatment processes however the extraction of the powder photocatalysts from the water after treatment is a considerable challenge as the powders tend to aggregate in water these challenges could be avoided by immobilization of photocatalyst over suitable supports 32 the most important properties of a suitable support are to be chemically inert to present a high specific surface area and to be transparent to visible and uv radiation also to overcome such limitations cu2o nrs were prepared as a thin film over copper sheets it is well known that film type photocatalysts have the characteristic of being easily separated from the water after the treatment processes as the film photocatalysts showed none of the aggregation effects of the suspended powder alternatives 31 moreover to avoid photo corrosion of cu2o nrs the film is covered with a thin layer of carbon the presence of a carbon layer over the cu2o nanoparticles will i enhance the photocatalytic activity six times higher than pure cu2o 33 34 ii protect cu2o from corrosion and iii protect water from the release of cu nanoparticles 30 therefore cu2o nrs have been chosen for disinfection and organic material removal processes due to i the systematic studies for simultaneous removal of dnom and disinfection water are scarce ii cu2o nrs being have a feasibility and simplicity for preparation and iii their separation and recycling at the end of the disinfection and dnom removal processes seemed practically feasible no needs for nano filtration or centrifugation the main objectives of the present work are i preparation of photocatalyst cu2o nrs in the form of a thin film over copper sheets ii detection and quantification the hydroxyl radicals produced under solar radiation in drinking water iii assesment the effectiveness of the removal of dnom by the oxidation radicals tannic acid was chosen as a model of dnom and iv determine whether or not the disinfection process inactivates a pathogen in the drinking water e coli was chosen as a model bacterium 2 experimental and method 2 1 preparation of the photocatalyst all chemicals used in this study including the 99 99 purity copper sheet were purchased from the supplier sigma aldrich the chemicals are analytical reagents and did not require further purification deionized water was used for the preparation of all aqueous solutions for the preparation of the cu2o nrs first copper hydroxide nanotubes were prepared on the surface of the copper sheet 33 34 the copper hydroxide was converted to copper oxide nanorods and then decorated with a carbon layer 30 details of the schematic preparation processes of cu2o nrs are shown in fig 1 copper sheet of 2 mm in thickness and 1 1 10 cm2 in the area was cleaned first in hydrochloric acid 37 and then ultrasonically in acetone and ethanol for 5 min sequentially the cleaned cu sheet was then immersed in 80 ml of the aqueous solution containing 2 5 m naoh and 0 125 m nh4 2s2o8 for 20 min importantly the temperature of the solution was maintained at about 3 c during the reaction to prevent the grown cu oh 2 nanorods from agglomeration through this procedure cu sheet turns to a light blue color the cu sheet was removed from the solution and rinsed with deionized water before drying in air subsequently cu sheet covered with cu oh 2 nanorods were immersed into an 10 glucose aqueous solution for about 12 h then dried under ambient conditions finally cu sheet covered with the hydroxide nanorods glucose was heated at 500 c in n2 atmosphere to form cu2o nrs covered with a carbon layer 2 2 characterization of the prepared photocatalyst the prepared photocatalyst was examined by scanning electron microscope sem and electron dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx using goel jsm 840 a scanning electron microscope x ray diffraction xrd was performed using a shimadzu x ray diffractometer xrd 6100 lab infrared spectroscopy ft ir and raman measurements were made via a thermo nicolet nexus 670 ft ir and raman x plora horiba respectively the chemical states of the cu element on the copper sheet surface were investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses using an escalab250 system with al kα x ray diffuse reflectance spectrum was obtained using shimadzu uv 3600 uv vis spectrophotometer and recorded in the uv vis range from 200 nm to 800 nm the output spectrum shows relation between the intensity of light reflected versus the wavelength barium sulfate baso4 was used as a standard for baseline correction 2 3 determination of reactive species produced from the cu2o nrs photocatalyst under solar radiation 2 3 1 detection and quantification of oh radicals the formation rate of oh at the photo illuminated sample water interface was detected by photoluminescence pl technique using coumarin cou as a probe molecule cou readily reacts with oh to produce a highly fluorescent product 7 hydroxy coumarin 7hc the method relies on the pl signal at 456 nm of 7hc generated at the catalyst water interface experimental procedures were as follows at a temperature of 20 c 1 1 10 cm2 of catalyst sample was immersed in 50 ml of 10 3 m cou aqueous solution in a closed glass container with a diameter of about 1 5 cm the solution was given enough time to reach an adsorption desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and 7hc in water before solar irradiation additional experimental results indicate that absorbed cou and 7hc on photocatalysts was less than 5 direct sunlight was used as a light source the average light intensity striking the surface of the reaction solution was about 7 8 kw m2 at an air temperature of 39 c according to atmospheric data collected at al ain airport by the abu dhabi national center of meteorology and seismology it is necessary to avoid heating the sample during photocatalytic disinfection and dnoms removal because of the sensitivity to temperature of the solubility of oxygen in water 35 thus all photocatalytic experiments for disinfection and dnoms removal were carried out in a thermostat controlled water bath at 20 c similar experiment conditions were maintained for the removal of dnom and inactivation of e coli bacteria pl spectra of generated 7hc were measured by cary 50 agilent fluorescence spectrophotometer the excitation wavelength was 332 nm the scanning speed was 1200 nm min and the pmt voltage was 700v the width of the excitation and emission slit were both set at 5 nm after direct exposure to solar radiation for a defined time interval 60 min the reaction solution was collected then filtered followed by measurement of the pl intensity at 456 nm to quantitatively determine the concentration of photo generated 7hc or oh the pl intensities of standard solutions composed of varying concentrations of 7hc in a 10 3 m cou aqueous solution were measured the concentration of the experimentally produced 7hc or oh in solution was determined by comparison of its pl intensity with those of the standard 7hc solutions furthermore the oh had a short lifetime usually 10 9 s and high reactivity influencing its detection efficiency 36 to capture all oh produced during photocatalysis the concentration 10 3 m of cou was much higher than that of produced oh 37 generally the photo generated oh has two forms one is free oh in solution and the other is surface bound oh on the sample surface 35 the above pl method mainly detect the free oh in solution 2 3 2 detection and quantification of reactive reducing species superoxide anions o2 nitro blue tetrazolium ntb was used to detect the production of o2 radicals via measurement of the absorbance by uv vis spectrophotometer at 260 nm 37 the method is similar to that used above for the photocatalytic determination of oh radicals the produced o2 radicals were quantitatively analyzed by detecting the decrease of nbt concentration with a varian carry eclips 50 uv vis spectrophotometer 2 4 photocatalytic removal of dnom under solar radiation the photocatalytic dnom removal experiment was carried out using the methods described in the previous section the experiments were performed during clear sunny weather in april 2018 9 am to 4 pm at the united arab emirates university campus to avoid the effect of temperature the experiment was performed in a thermostat controlled water bath the photocatalytic removal of dnom assisted by solar radiation was carried using tannic acid as a model for dnom in drinking water a 60 ppm concentration of tannic acid was placed in a sealed glass container with the photocatalyst copper sheet area 1 1 10 cm2 the sample was kept in dark for 10 h before the commencement of the photocatalytic experiment samples were collected at defined intervals of time and were analyzed for tannic acid concentration using a varian carry e clips 50 uv vis spectrophotometer to confirm the removal and mineralization of dnom total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod were carried out toc was carried out for samples before and at the end of photocatalytic experiment using shimadzu toc vchs the samples were acidified with phosphoric acid before analyses to avoid the interference of inorganic carbon as carbonate and bicarbonate chemical oxygen demand cod measurements were carried out by k2cr2o7 back titration 38 using ferrion as indicator and ammonium ferrous sulphate as standard solution the experiment was carried out as the photocatalytic degradation experiment the concentration of tannic acid used in the cod experiment is 100 ppm 3 ml scarfing samples were collected at different time interval and analyzed for cod 2 5 bacterial deactivation experiment a bacterial suspension of e coli was prepared as follows sixty ml of a prepared e coli suspension with 8720 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 1 was used for the deactivation experiment under sunlight irradiation the 60 ml e coli suspension was mixed with cu2o nrs on the 1 1 10 cm2 copper sheet in a sealed glass container the glass container containing the bacteria suspension and the photocatalyst was kept in a thermostat controlled water bath to maintain a 20 c temperature within the sample and exposed to direct solar radiation samples were collected at regular intervals from the irradiated suspension the collected samples from each time interval were divided into two portions the first portion was analyzed for e coli content the second portion was filtered using a 0 4 μ filter the filtrate was analyzed for k and cu contents using icp varian 710 the standard plated counting method was used for the e coli assay aliquots of 100 μl were spread in triplicate on luria bertani agar tryptone 10 g l nacl 10 g l yeast extract 5 g l and 10 g l sigma aldrich when very low concentrations of e coli were expected to be found in samples 500 μl aliquots were plated to attain a detection limit of 2 cfu ml 1 colonies were counted after 24 h incubation at 37 c at the beginning of each experiment a control sample was kept in the dark at room temperature and plated in triplicate again at the end of the experiment re growth of e coli was determined for all experiments by leaving the last samples after 8 h at room temperature for 48 h followed by plating using the method described above all experiments were performed in triplicate for reproducibility of experimental data the obtained results were within the average error limit of 5 2 6 recycling and reusability the durability and stability of the prepared cu2o nrs were studied by both quantification of the quantity of hydroxyl radical produced and tannic acid degradation percentage at the end of five cycles in separate experiment at the end of each cycle the cu2o nrs photocatalyst is washed with deionized water and dried at 80 c for 2 h the quantity of 7 hydroxyl qumarin formed by direct sunlight irradiation of 50 ml of 0 001 m qumarin with cu2o nrs on 1 1 10 cm copper sheet for five hours was measured also tannic acid concentration was measured at the end of each cycle of photocatalytic experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of photocatalyst when copper sheet was immersed in the alkaline oxidant mixture a blue solid film of cu oh 2 gradually grew on the sheet surface in a process represented by the following equation 1 cu 4naoh nh4 s2o8 cu oh 2 2na2so4 2nh3 2h2o previous study has shown that the cu oh 2 produced has a nanotube form 33 thus the produced cu oh 2 was immersed in a glucose solution for 12 h to form a layer of glucose covering the cu oh 2 after heating in a tube furnace at 500 c for 2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere the cu oh 2 decorated glucose was condensed to cu2o nrs coated with a carbon sheet 30 fig 2 a shows the sem of the produced cu2o nrs on the copper sheet after heating it is clear that the cu2o formed in non parallel rods with a diameter of 100 130 nm and length 1 5 2 5 μm the distribution of cu2o on the surface of the copper sheet is inhomogeneous density the edx analysis fig 2b shows the elemental analysis of the cu2o nrs produced they are composed of copper oxygen and carbon from the carbon layer xrd and ir analyses show the formed phases of cu2o nrs and characteristic peaks of the carbon layer xrd analysis shows the phases of the cu2o nrs fig 2c fig 2c shows the diffraction peaks with miller indices 110 200 220 and 311 this confirms the formation of a pure phase of cu2o nrs 39 40 fig 2d shows the ft ir analysis of cu2o nrs recording the functional groups on the surface ir analysis shows the c c characteristic peaks of the carbon layer at 1401 and 1639 cm 1 41 raman spectra were the best way to confirm the formation of the carbon graphitized carbon and graphene layer over the cu2o nrs with raman techniques the percentage of organic part carbon graphitized carbon and graphene and their characteristic bands could be confirmed raman spectra of cu2o nrs samples are presented in fig 2e the high intensity band of the graphene layer the specific band g band at 1579 cm 1 originated from the in plane vibration of ordered sp2 bonded carbon atoms in aromatic conjugated also a very low intensity band appeared at 1340 cm 1 this band is originated from the out plane vibration of sp3 carbon present in the form of defects also peaks at 500 and 622 cm 1 were assigned for cu2o 42 43 finally the oxidation state and bond energies can be detected from xps analysis the oxidation state of copper was explored through the cu 2p core level from xps as shown in fig 2f the characteristic peaks of cu and cu were detected at 939 and 958 ev respectively 27 44 in addition according to tg results the figure did not give here for a sake of brevity the protecting carbon layer of cu2o nrs is completely decomposed before 600 c in the oxygen atmosphere the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra studies is important for determination of absorption wavelength and determination of the energy band gab of the prepared cu2o nrs as shown in fig 2g fig 2h shows the tauc plot calculated from diffuse reflectance spectra the band gap energies were calculated using the results obtained from the drs spectra applying tauc plot method 45 the band gap was calculated considering that cu2o nrs is direct band gab semiconductors and using eq 2 2 α h ν 1 n a h ν e g where α is the absorptivity coefficient and hν is the energy of the applied incident light in electron volt n depends on the nature of transition for direct allowed transition the value for n is 1 2 a is proportionality 46 the value of eg is estimated from plot of αhν 1 n vs hν as shown in fig 2h and found to be 2 8 ev 3 2 formation of reactive species during sunlight irradiation of photocatalyst when cu2o is exposed to visible light photons with sufficient energy hv eg the photon energy is absorbed and electrons are released from the valence band into the conduction band this movement of electrons leaves a hole in the valence band under aerobic conditions the conduction band electrons are trapped by oxygen molecules to form super oxide anions o2 on the other hand the photon generated hole in the absence of a reducing species converts the surface adsorbed water or hydroxide ions into hydroxyl radicals the following equations show the reactions of h and e with water leading to the generation of hydroxyl radicals 3 cu2o hv e h 4 o2 e o2 5 o2 o2 2h h2o2 o2 6 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 7 oh h oh 8 h2o h oh h it has been shown that oh and o2 are the most important reactive radicals and are the key species in a mineralizing various organic compound and deactivating microorganisms it is well known that hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anions o2 are key species in mineralizing various organic compounds and microorganism deactivation in photocatalytic water treatment systems a linear relation has been found between both inactivation efficiencies of microorganisms in water and the removal of dnom on the one hand and the quantity of hydroxyl radical formation on the other 47 48 herein the formation of active species in water under solar radiation using cu2o nrs as the photocatalyst will be tested and quantified in water samples the hydroxyl radicals were quantified based on a modified method described in 49 the concentration of oh radicals were calculated by assuming that 6 of total oh radicals were captured as 7 hydroxy coumarin 7hc 50 the stoichiometry ratio is for one mole of oh radicals to be consumed in the production of one mole of 7 hydroxy coumarin according to the following reaction in eq 9 9 eq 10 was used for calculation of the quantity of the produced hydroxyl radicals 51 10 x a 6 b where x is the total oh radical concentration in μm produced during photocatalysis a is the produced 7 hydroxy coumarin concentration and b is the produced 7 hydroxy in the dark calibration curve fig 3 was constructed and used for the quantitative determination of the produced hydroxyl radical from photocatalytic experiments using cu2o nrs coumarin in μm produced during the light control experiment the concentration of 7 hydroxy coumarin was calculated using a standard curve of known concentrations fig 3b this pl calibration curve was obtained by plotting the pl intensities measured at 456 nm collected from fig 3a as a function of the standard concentration of 7 hydroxy coumarin the produced hydroxyl at different time intervals for this photocatalytic experiment is shown in fig 4 it shows the increases of pl intensity of 7 hydroxy coumarin at 460 nm with time it is clear that more hydroxyl radicals were produced leading to the formation of 7 hydroxy coumarin the quantity of the formed 7 hydroxyl radicals in the 0 001 m cou using cu2o nrs under direct solar radiation was calculated from the standard calibration curve fig 3 for the control samples kept in dark no emission peak was found at 460 nm the quantity of the produced hydroxyl at different time intervals for this photocatalytic experiment is shown in fig 4b it is calculated according to eq 10 it is clear that the quantity of hydroxyl radical produced at different time intervals in 0 001 coumarin solution increased with time the formation of superoxide anion radicals was tested and quantitatively analyzed by detecting the decrease in the concentration of ntb at a wavelength of 260 nm nbt k 5 88 104 m1 s 1 51 no change in the shape and absorbance of the uv vis spectra of nbt collected at different time intervals was observed for simplicity and brevity this curve is not presented a minimal decrease of nbt absorption was noticed at the end of the experiment this indicated that no o 2 radicals were present in the solution however from a thermodynamic point of view o2 radicals are expected to be present because the conduction band potential of cu2o is more negative 0 53 ev than the oxidation reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev 52 it is believed that any formed o2 reacted immediately with water leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals according to the reaction shown in eqs 4 and 5 the obtained results indicate that oh is the main reactive species which causes degradation of dnom and inactivation of microorganisms in these photocatalytic experiments 3 3 removal of dnoms tannic acid mainly derived from plants is considered to be a dnom in water and will be used as a model for dnoms in drinking water in our experiments fig 5 a show the uv spectra of tannic acid at different time intervals during the disinfection experiment and its normalized curve fig 5b it is clear that the concentration of tannic acid decreases with time about 99 removal of tannic acid was achieved after 5 h of solar irradiation while there was no change of the tannic concentration of the samples which had been kept in darkness the reactions occurring on the solid liquid interface surfaces were described by langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model as in eq 11 53 54 11 r0 d c d t k r k c e q 1 k c e q this model could be applied for photocatalytic degradation for organic compounds in water where r0 is the rate of disappearance of the organic substances kr is the rate limiting step at maximum coverage under the given experimental condition k is the reactant adsorption constant and ceq is the equilibrium bulk solute concentration in the case when kceq 1 the equation is transformed into zero order limiting step rate expression 12 12 c c0 k in the case when kceq 1 eq 10 is transformed to first order limiting step expression lnct c0 kt so the degradation of tannic acid was kinetically modeled using the zero and first order rate equations fig 5 c d the degradation data for tannic acid shows the best fit to the first order rate equation with r2 0 98 and the degradation rate constant of 0 83 m h the degradation of tannic acid is affected by hydroxyl radicals oh generated in the drinking water by cu2o nrs exposed to direct solar radiation the values toc and cod analyses confirm the removal and mineralization of organic material from water 3 32 the obtained results showed that the toc values decreased from 31 ppm to 2 1 ppm at the end of photocatalytic experiments the results of cod reduction are showed in fig 5e the percentage reduction of cod values shows the same trend as uv vis spectroscopic fig 5a the results obtained showed that the mineralization is slow at the beginning of photocatalytic degradation of tannic acid also 93 percent mineralization was achieved at the end of photocatalytic experiments 3 4 inactivation of bacteria e coli for the investigation of e coli inactivation 50 ml of e coli suspension 7820 cfu was placed in a sealed glass container with 1 1 10 cm2 cu2o nrs sheet and exposed to direct solar radiation samples were collected at regular time intervals and analyzed for e coli content fig 6 a shows the e coli content plotted against time for these experiments it is clear that the e coli concentration decreases with increasing time and complete inactivation was attained after 8 h inactivation increases with increasing hydroxyl radical concentration in the suspension similar results have been found for e coli inactivation using titanium oxide photocatalyst and uv radiation 55 56 in our experiments first order kinetics was found to be the best fit for the inactivation rate data fig 6b with a rate constant of 0 845 cfu h it also confirms that oh radicals serve as the main oxidant and are capable of inactivating microorganisms including viruses bacteria spores and protozoa 57 these hydroxyl radicals can cause cellular damage through lipid and protein oxidation reactions 55 it is believed that the generated reactive oh radical makes the oxidative damage to the e coli cellular components 58 59 the schematic diagram of the antibacterial mechanism is shown in fig 7 the inactivation of e coli could also be confirmed by tracking k ion concentration in the bacteria suspension during photocatalytic inactivation processes 59 during inactivation k leaks from the cell membrane and its concentration is considered to be an indicator of bacterial inactivation 60 fig 8 a shows the concentration of k ion of the solution at different inactivation intervals it is clear that the k concentration in solution increases with time this could be explained as follows the diffusion of k from cytoplasm indicates damage to the cell membrane the cell membrane of microorganisms is cell walls composed of an outer membrane and a peptide glycine organic component in addition to a na and k pump used in atp production during the inactivation process the na k pump ceases to function due to the collapse of the cell membrane damage damaging the production of atp in the cell 60 similar results have been obtained for the inactivation of e coli with red phosphorus photocatalyst under visible light 59 the copper ion concentration was continuously measured during the bacterial inactivation processes this was conducted to assess the stability of the prepared cu2o nrs against photochemical corrosion and to monitor the safety of the treated drinking water fig 8b shows the change in copper ion concentration during the inactivation process from this figure it is clear that the copper ion concentration increases at the early stage of e coli inactivation this may be attributed to the partial dissolution of those parts of cu2o nrs sheet which were not completely covered by the carbon layer 61 a parallel set of photocatalytic bacterial deactivation experiments was performed under conditions of darkness to confirm that the inactivation of e coli during solar radiation exposure was due to attack by hydroxyl radicals rather than factors such as i adhesion on the catalyst surface 62 or ii attack by copper metal either from the surface or from trace cu ion in solution 63 no change of e coli bacteria counts was observed in the experiments conducted in darkness this confirms that the inactivation of bacteria is mainly due to attack by hydroxyl radicals the e coli inactivation and dnom removal are summarized and shown schematically in fig 9 3 5 ionic concentrations in the deactivated drinking water samples the main drawback of the current technology for drinking water disinfection is the generation of anions in the water especially the inorganic dbb s bromate bro3 iodate io3 chlorate clo2 and chlorite clo one of the e coli inactivation experiments on drinking water was followed by an analysis of a range of anions using ion chromatography ic 90 dionex at the end of the photocatalytic experiment the analysis results are given in table 1 it is clear that there was a slight change in the concentration of nitrate and bicarbonate as a result of the photocatalysis process no inorganic dbb s were detected in the analysis in addition ph changed as a result of the inactivation process even though the disinfection experiments had been performed in closed containers the slight change of ph and bicarbonate may be attributed to the mineralization of leaking organic matter leached from the e coli bacteria during the deactivation processes 64 3 6 recycling and reusability the durability and stability of the prepared cu2o nrs were studied this was carried out by measuring the efficiency of producing hydroxyl radical and degradation of tannic acid the results of recycling are showed in fig 10 a b it is clear that the efficiency for producing hydroxyl radical is stable also 97 of degradation was obtained after five cycles this results shows that prepared photocatalyst catalyst could be used for five cycles with good stability so far commonly used heterogeneous photocatalysis for disinfection and dnom have been investigated mostly in laboratories however cu2onrs could be used in small scale by people who do not have access to drinking water services living in rural areas as it is simple safe do not need electrical source and no maintenance is required it could be used by placing cupper sheet covered with cu2onrs in transparent vessel to direct solar radiation for a period of time 65 it can also be applied on the smaller scale near storage tanks at homes where the water may have been infected within the distribution network before arriving at the consumers taps 66 additionally cu2o nrs in comparison with the popular photocatalysts such as tio2 zno bismuth carbon mos2 g c3n4 based photocatalysts black phosphorus and metal organic frameworks if they are used either in single form or as part of heterojunction shows superior properties as it is easier to scale up for real application good stability inexpensive visible light active and high efficiency for disinfection and removal of dnom 67 68 4 conclusions this study introduces a novel safe and cheap method for drinking water disinfection using solar radiation the method employs copper metal a cheap and abundant resource for the preparation of a photocatalyst cu2o nrs the method takes advantage of a clean renewable sustainable and cheap source of energy solar radiation for the generation of hydroxyl radical active species the presence of the reactive oh species in photocatalyst disinfected waters was confirmed and quantified the waters were also assayed for the formation of any inorganic dbb s during e coli inactivation the prepared photocatalyst can be used effectively to remove dnom which is the precursor of organic dbb s found in the traditional disinfection methods the prepared photocatalyst can be used for pathogen inactivation e coli was used as a tested pathogen in this study the prepared cu2o nrs photocatalyst can be reused for five cycles of e coli inactivation and dnom removal finally it should be noted that this method has been tested so far on only one bacterial species e coli and one nom compound tannic acid in non continuous flow further trials in continuous flow are needed to be conducted additionally the potential to remove other dnom s such as humic acid needs to be explored furthermore systematic studies on the formation of organic dbb s are needed technical improvements in covering the cu2o nrs with a carbon layer will reduce or prevent the release of copper ions into drinking water during the treatment process

13581,in this work copper oxide nanorods cu2o nrs were directly prepared from copper sheet as substrate the as grown cu2o nrs were modified through surface carbon layer deposition via a single step thermal treatment method the carbon modified cu2o nrs has been characterized by scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersion x ray spectroscopy edx x ray diffraction xrd thermogravimetric

cu2o nrs in a modified form could be used for five cycles of photocatalytic degradation keywords cu2o nanorods disinfection dissolved organic matter solar radiation photocatalyst 1 introduction disinfection is the final ultimate stage of drinking water treatment and production it commonly influences the quality of the final water product generally chlorine chloramines and chlorine dioxide are used in water treatment to inactivate microorganisms free chlorination is the common disinfectant technique practiced in egypt and other parts of the world the main drawback of this approach is the consequent formation of inorganic and organic disinfection byproducts dbb s 1 alternative methods including ozonation and ultraviolet radiation have also been employed in the disinfection of water worldwide however these latter methods have disadvantages in that they require expensive chemicals and or costly equipment to trigger the disinfection process nanoparticles have been used as disinfectants silver magnesium oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles are efficient for disinfectants and removing organic pollutants 2 3 the disinfection capabilities of the nanoparticles depend mainly on the direct interaction and collisions between microorganism cell membranes and nanoparticles 4 applying this technology to drinking water disinfection requires nano filters to ultimately remove the nanoparticles after disinfection as they may constitute toxins if their levels in the final water product are high this may increase the expense of the method natural organic matter nom is present in the soil water and sediments nom in water is derived from the breakdown of plants and is also associated with bacteria algae and aquatic plants natural sources of drinking water generally contain nom as a result of water soil interactions within the hydrologic cycle the biosphere and geosphere 5 nom is considered a mixture of complex heterogeneous organic compounds such as the humic substances humic acid fulvic acid humans and tannic acid polysaccharides amino sugars proteins peptides lipids and minor hydrophilic acids etc 5 dissolved humic materials represent more than 90 of dissolved organic carbon in drinking water 6 the portion of nom that passes through a 0 45 μm filter is the dissolved component and is considered as the dissolved natural organic matter dnom dnom is the most challenging form of nom to manage concerning drinking water treatment 7 dnom raises problems in the production of drinking water as dnom is a cause of taste odor and coloration of raw drinking water 8 and is considered as a source of carbon nutrients and energy for bacteria dnom reacts with chlorine chloramine and chlorine oxide which used for water disinfection to produce halogenated disinfection byproducts organic dbb s such as trichloroethanes chloroacetic acid chloroacetonitriles haloketones chloroaldehydes and chlorofuranones which are carcinogenic compounds even in trace quantities 9 dnom also promotes biological growths in the water distribution system 10 many technologies have been adapted to eliminate dnom from drinking water 11 dnom has been removed from water by coagulation electrochemical methods membranes adsorption ion exchange bio filtration 12 13 uv chlorine oxidation 14 and advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation process systems include o3 h2o2 o3 uv uv h2o2 tio2 uv h2o2 catalyst fenton photo fenton processes and ultrasound 15 16 generally advanced oxidation processes produce oxygen radicals oh or o2 that attack the dnom at the rich electron sites leading to breakdown and mineralization to form carbon dioxide and water the oh radical is one of the most powerful known oxidants the reaction rates of the oh radicals with nom compounds are usually several orders of magnitude higher than those achieved using molecular ozone under the same conditions the oxidation potentials of oh are 2 86 ev higher than for ozone which is 2 42 ev 17 the reaction rate constants between oh and organic species are in the range of 108 1010 m 1 s 1 18 oh radicals are highly nonselective oxidants enabling a very large number of reactants the reactions of oh radicals with nom proceeds in three different ways i by the addition of oh to double bonds ii by h atom abstraction which yields carbon centered radicals and iii by the oh gaining an electron from an organic substituent to date few investigations have been conducted to assess the efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection powered by solar energy 19 22 numerous photocatalysts have been used to generate oh radicals for the deactivation of microorganism and water disinfection 23 titanium and graphene ag and agi doped with bi and many semiconductors have been applied to disinfect water 24 25 cu2o is a low cost and non toxic semiconductor material with a narrow band gap that can be prepared in many forms and used as a visible light driven photo catalyst it is may be prepared in such forms as conventional and hierarchical nanocubes 26 nanoparticle composite materials with graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 27 ag 28 graphene 29 and cu2o core shells 26 recently cu2o nrs were synthesized for use in the visible light driven photo catalysis of co2 reduction and drinking water disinfection 30 also cu2o in nanowires form decorated with silver nanoparticles was used for inactivation of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus from drinking water 31 previously photocatalysts were used in a powder form in water treatment processes however the extraction of the powder photocatalysts from the water after treatment is a considerable challenge as the powders tend to aggregate in water these challenges could be avoided by immobilization of photocatalyst over suitable supports 32 the most important properties of a suitable support are to be chemically inert to present a high specific surface area and to be transparent to visible and uv radiation also to overcome such limitations cu2o nrs were prepared as a thin film over copper sheets it is well known that film type photocatalysts have the characteristic of being easily separated from the water after the treatment processes as the film photocatalysts showed none of the aggregation effects of the suspended powder alternatives 31 moreover to avoid photo corrosion of cu2o nrs the film is covered with a thin layer of carbon the presence of a carbon layer over the cu2o nanoparticles will i enhance the photocatalytic activity six times higher than pure cu2o 33 34 ii protect cu2o from corrosion and iii protect water from the release of cu nanoparticles 30 therefore cu2o nrs have been chosen for disinfection and organic material removal processes due to i the systematic studies for simultaneous removal of dnom and disinfection water are scarce ii cu2o nrs being have a feasibility and simplicity for preparation and iii their separation and recycling at the end of the disinfection and dnom removal processes seemed practically feasible no needs for nano filtration or centrifugation the main objectives of the present work are i preparation of photocatalyst cu2o nrs in the form of a thin film over copper sheets ii detection and quantification the hydroxyl radicals produced under solar radiation in drinking water iii assesment the effectiveness of the removal of dnom by the oxidation radicals tannic acid was chosen as a model of dnom and iv determine whether or not the disinfection process inactivates a pathogen in the drinking water e coli was chosen as a model bacterium 2 experimental and method 2 1 preparation of the photocatalyst all chemicals used in this study including the 99 99 purity copper sheet were purchased from the supplier sigma aldrich the chemicals are analytical reagents and did not require further purification deionized water was used for the preparation of all aqueous solutions for the preparation of the cu2o nrs first copper hydroxide nanotubes were prepared on the surface of the copper sheet 33 34 the copper hydroxide was converted to copper oxide nanorods and then decorated with a carbon layer 30 details of the schematic preparation processes of cu2o nrs are shown in fig 1 copper sheet of 2 mm in thickness and 1 1 10 cm2 in the area was cleaned first in hydrochloric acid 37 and then ultrasonically in acetone and ethanol for 5 min sequentially the cleaned cu sheet was then immersed in 80 ml of the aqueous solution containing 2 5 m naoh and 0 125 m nh4 2s2o8 for 20 min importantly the temperature of the solution was maintained at about 3 c during the reaction to prevent the grown cu oh 2 nanorods from agglomeration through this procedure cu sheet turns to a light blue color the cu sheet was removed from the solution and rinsed with deionized water before drying in air subsequently cu sheet covered with cu oh 2 nanorods were immersed into an 10 glucose aqueous solution for about 12 h then dried under ambient conditions finally cu sheet covered with the hydroxide nanorods glucose was heated at 500 c in n2 atmosphere to form cu2o nrs covered with a carbon layer 2 2 characterization of the prepared photocatalyst the prepared photocatalyst was examined by scanning electron microscope sem and electron dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx using goel jsm 840 a scanning electron microscope x ray diffraction xrd was performed using a shimadzu x ray diffractometer xrd 6100 lab infrared spectroscopy ft ir and raman measurements were made via a thermo nicolet nexus 670 ft ir and raman x plora horiba respectively the chemical states of the cu element on the copper sheet surface were investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses using an escalab250 system with al kα x ray diffuse reflectance spectrum was obtained using shimadzu uv 3600 uv vis spectrophotometer and recorded in the uv vis range from 200 nm to 800 nm the output spectrum shows relation between the intensity of light reflected versus the wavelength barium sulfate baso4 was used as a standard for baseline correction 2 3 determination of reactive species produced from the cu2o nrs photocatalyst under solar radiation 2 3 1 detection and quantification of oh radicals the formation rate of oh at the photo illuminated sample water interface was detected by photoluminescence pl technique using coumarin cou as a probe molecule cou readily reacts with oh to produce a highly fluorescent product 7 hydroxy coumarin 7hc the method relies on the pl signal at 456 nm of 7hc generated at the catalyst water interface experimental procedures were as follows at a temperature of 20 c 1 1 10 cm2 of catalyst sample was immersed in 50 ml of 10 3 m cou aqueous solution in a closed glass container with a diameter of about 1 5 cm the solution was given enough time to reach an adsorption desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and 7hc in water before solar irradiation additional experimental results indicate that absorbed cou and 7hc on photocatalysts was less than 5 direct sunlight was used as a light source the average light intensity striking the surface of the reaction solution was about 7 8 kw m2 at an air temperature of 39 c according to atmospheric data collected at al ain airport by the abu dhabi national center of meteorology and seismology it is necessary to avoid heating the sample during photocatalytic disinfection and dnoms removal because of the sensitivity to temperature of the solubility of oxygen in water 35 thus all photocatalytic experiments for disinfection and dnoms removal were carried out in a thermostat controlled water bath at 20 c similar experiment conditions were maintained for the removal of dnom and inactivation of e coli bacteria pl spectra of generated 7hc were measured by cary 50 agilent fluorescence spectrophotometer the excitation wavelength was 332 nm the scanning speed was 1200 nm min and the pmt voltage was 700v the width of the excitation and emission slit were both set at 5 nm after direct exposure to solar radiation for a defined time interval 60 min the reaction solution was collected then filtered followed by measurement of the pl intensity at 456 nm to quantitatively determine the concentration of photo generated 7hc or oh the pl intensities of standard solutions composed of varying concentrations of 7hc in a 10 3 m cou aqueous solution were measured the concentration of the experimentally produced 7hc or oh in solution was determined by comparison of its pl intensity with those of the standard 7hc solutions furthermore the oh had a short lifetime usually 10 9 s and high reactivity influencing its detection efficiency 36 to capture all oh produced during photocatalysis the concentration 10 3 m of cou was much higher than that of produced oh 37 generally the photo generated oh has two forms one is free oh in solution and the other is surface bound oh on the sample surface 35 the above pl method mainly detect the free oh in solution 2 3 2 detection and quantification of reactive reducing species superoxide anions o2 nitro blue tetrazolium ntb was used to detect the production of o2 radicals via measurement of the absorbance by uv vis spectrophotometer at 260 nm 37 the method is similar to that used above for the photocatalytic determination of oh radicals the produced o2 radicals were quantitatively analyzed by detecting the decrease of nbt concentration with a varian carry eclips 50 uv vis spectrophotometer 2 4 photocatalytic removal of dnom under solar radiation the photocatalytic dnom removal experiment was carried out using the methods described in the previous section the experiments were performed during clear sunny weather in april 2018 9 am to 4 pm at the united arab emirates university campus to avoid the effect of temperature the experiment was performed in a thermostat controlled water bath the photocatalytic removal of dnom assisted by solar radiation was carried using tannic acid as a model for dnom in drinking water a 60 ppm concentration of tannic acid was placed in a sealed glass container with the photocatalyst copper sheet area 1 1 10 cm2 the sample was kept in dark for 10 h before the commencement of the photocatalytic experiment samples were collected at defined intervals of time and were analyzed for tannic acid concentration using a varian carry e clips 50 uv vis spectrophotometer to confirm the removal and mineralization of dnom total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod were carried out toc was carried out for samples before and at the end of photocatalytic experiment using shimadzu toc vchs the samples were acidified with phosphoric acid before analyses to avoid the interference of inorganic carbon as carbonate and bicarbonate chemical oxygen demand cod measurements were carried out by k2cr2o7 back titration 38 using ferrion as indicator and ammonium ferrous sulphate as standard solution the experiment was carried out as the photocatalytic degradation experiment the concentration of tannic acid used in the cod experiment is 100 ppm 3 ml scarfing samples were collected at different time interval and analyzed for cod 2 5 bacterial deactivation experiment a bacterial suspension of e coli was prepared as follows sixty ml of a prepared e coli suspension with 8720 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 1 was used for the deactivation experiment under sunlight irradiation the 60 ml e coli suspension was mixed with cu2o nrs on the 1 1 10 cm2 copper sheet in a sealed glass container the glass container containing the bacteria suspension and the photocatalyst was kept in a thermostat controlled water bath to maintain a 20 c temperature within the sample and exposed to direct solar radiation samples were collected at regular intervals from the irradiated suspension the collected samples from each time interval were divided into two portions the first portion was analyzed for e coli content the second portion was filtered using a 0 4 μ filter the filtrate was analyzed for k and cu contents using icp varian 710 the standard plated counting method was used for the e coli assay aliquots of 100 μl were spread in triplicate on luria bertani agar tryptone 10 g l nacl 10 g l yeast extract 5 g l and 10 g l sigma aldrich when very low concentrations of e coli were expected to be found in samples 500 μl aliquots were plated to attain a detection limit of 2 cfu ml 1 colonies were counted after 24 h incubation at 37 c at the beginning of each experiment a control sample was kept in the dark at room temperature and plated in triplicate again at the end of the experiment re growth of e coli was determined for all experiments by leaving the last samples after 8 h at room temperature for 48 h followed by plating using the method described above all experiments were performed in triplicate for reproducibility of experimental data the obtained results were within the average error limit of 5 2 6 recycling and reusability the durability and stability of the prepared cu2o nrs were studied by both quantification of the quantity of hydroxyl radical produced and tannic acid degradation percentage at the end of five cycles in separate experiment at the end of each cycle the cu2o nrs photocatalyst is washed with deionized water and dried at 80 c for 2 h the quantity of 7 hydroxyl qumarin formed by direct sunlight irradiation of 50 ml of 0 001 m qumarin with cu2o nrs on 1 1 10 cm copper sheet for five hours was measured also tannic acid concentration was measured at the end of each cycle of photocatalytic experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of photocatalyst when copper sheet was immersed in the alkaline oxidant mixture a blue solid film of cu oh 2 gradually grew on the sheet surface in a process represented by the following equation 1 cu 4naoh nh4 s2o8 cu oh 2 2na2so4 2nh3 2h2o previous study has shown that the cu oh 2 produced has a nanotube form 33 thus the produced cu oh 2 was immersed in a glucose solution for 12 h to form a layer of glucose covering the cu oh 2 after heating in a tube furnace at 500 c for 2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere the cu oh 2 decorated glucose was condensed to cu2o nrs coated with a carbon sheet 30 fig 2 a shows the sem of the produced cu2o nrs on the copper sheet after heating it is clear that the cu2o formed in non parallel rods with a diameter of 100 130 nm and length 1 5 2 5 μm the distribution of cu2o on the surface of the copper sheet is inhomogeneous density the edx analysis fig 2b shows the elemental analysis of the cu2o nrs produced they are composed of copper oxygen and carbon from the carbon layer xrd and ir analyses show the formed phases of cu2o nrs and characteristic peaks of the carbon layer xrd analysis shows the phases of the cu2o nrs fig 2c fig 2c shows the diffraction peaks with miller indices 110 200 220 and 311 this confirms the formation of a pure phase of cu2o nrs 39 40 fig 2d shows the ft ir analysis of cu2o nrs recording the functional groups on the surface ir analysis shows the c c characteristic peaks of the carbon layer at 1401 and 1639 cm 1 41 raman spectra were the best way to confirm the formation of the carbon graphitized carbon and graphene layer over the cu2o nrs with raman techniques the percentage of organic part carbon graphitized carbon and graphene and their characteristic bands could be confirmed raman spectra of cu2o nrs samples are presented in fig 2e the high intensity band of the graphene layer the specific band g band at 1579 cm 1 originated from the in plane vibration of ordered sp2 bonded carbon atoms in aromatic conjugated also a very low intensity band appeared at 1340 cm 1 this band is originated from the out plane vibration of sp3 carbon present in the form of defects also peaks at 500 and 622 cm 1 were assigned for cu2o 42 43 finally the oxidation state and bond energies can be detected from xps analysis the oxidation state of copper was explored through the cu 2p core level from xps as shown in fig 2f the characteristic peaks of cu and cu were detected at 939 and 958 ev respectively 27 44 in addition according to tg results the figure did not give here for a sake of brevity the protecting carbon layer of cu2o nrs is completely decomposed before 600 c in the oxygen atmosphere the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra studies is important for determination of absorption wavelength and determination of the energy band gab of the prepared cu2o nrs as shown in fig 2g fig 2h shows the tauc plot calculated from diffuse reflectance spectra the band gap energies were calculated using the results obtained from the drs spectra applying tauc plot method 45 the band gap was calculated considering that cu2o nrs is direct band gab semiconductors and using eq 2 2 α h ν 1 n a h ν e g where α is the absorptivity coefficient and hν is the energy of the applied incident light in electron volt n depends on the nature of transition for direct allowed transition the value for n is 1 2 a is proportionality 46 the value of eg is estimated from plot of αhν 1 n vs hν as shown in fig 2h and found to be 2 8 ev 3 2 formation of reactive species during sunlight irradiation of photocatalyst when cu2o is exposed to visible light photons with sufficient energy hv eg the photon energy is absorbed and electrons are released from the valence band into the conduction band this movement of electrons leaves a hole in the valence band under aerobic conditions the conduction band electrons are trapped by oxygen molecules to form super oxide anions o2 on the other hand the photon generated hole in the absence of a reducing species converts the surface adsorbed water or hydroxide ions into hydroxyl radicals the following equations show the reactions of h and e with water leading to the generation of hydroxyl radicals 3 cu2o hv e h 4 o2 e o2 5 o2 o2 2h h2o2 o2 6 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 7 oh h oh 8 h2o h oh h it has been shown that oh and o2 are the most important reactive radicals and are the key species in a mineralizing various organic compound and deactivating microorganisms it is well known that hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anions o2 are key species in mineralizing various organic compounds and microorganism deactivation in photocatalytic water treatment systems a linear relation has been found between both inactivation efficiencies of microorganisms in water and the removal of dnom on the one hand and the quantity of hydroxyl radical formation on the other 47 48 herein the formation of active species in water under solar radiation using cu2o nrs as the photocatalyst will be tested and quantified in water samples the hydroxyl radicals were quantified based on a modified method described in 49 the concentration of oh radicals were calculated by assuming that 6 of total oh radicals were captured as 7 hydroxy coumarin 7hc 50 the stoichiometry ratio is for one mole of oh radicals to be consumed in the production of one mole of 7 hydroxy coumarin according to the following reaction in eq 9 9 eq 10 was used for calculation of the quantity of the produced hydroxyl radicals 51 10 x a 6 b where x is the total oh radical concentration in μm produced during photocatalysis a is the produced 7 hydroxy coumarin concentration and b is the produced 7 hydroxy in the dark calibration curve fig 3 was constructed and used for the quantitative determination of the produced hydroxyl radical from photocatalytic experiments using cu2o nrs coumarin in μm produced during the light control experiment the concentration of 7 hydroxy coumarin was calculated using a standard curve of known concentrations fig 3b this pl calibration curve was obtained by plotting the pl intensities measured at 456 nm collected from fig 3a as a function of the standard concentration of 7 hydroxy coumarin the produced hydroxyl at different time intervals for this photocatalytic experiment is shown in fig 4 it shows the increases of pl intensity of 7 hydroxy coumarin at 460 nm with time it is clear that more hydroxyl radicals were produced leading to the formation of 7 hydroxy coumarin the quantity of the formed 7 hydroxyl radicals in the 0 001 m cou using cu2o nrs under direct solar radiation was calculated from the standard calibration curve fig 3 for the control samples kept in dark no emission peak was found at 460 nm the quantity of the produced hydroxyl at different time intervals for this photocatalytic experiment is shown in fig 4b it is calculated according to eq 10 it is clear that the quantity of hydroxyl radical produced at different time intervals in 0 001 coumarin solution increased with time the formation of superoxide anion radicals was tested and quantitatively analyzed by detecting the decrease in the concentration of ntb at a wavelength of 260 nm nbt k 5 88 104 m1 s 1 51 no change in the shape and absorbance of the uv vis spectra of nbt collected at different time intervals was observed for simplicity and brevity this curve is not presented a minimal decrease of nbt absorption was noticed at the end of the experiment this indicated that no o 2 radicals were present in the solution however from a thermodynamic point of view o2 radicals are expected to be present because the conduction band potential of cu2o is more negative 0 53 ev than the oxidation reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev 52 it is believed that any formed o2 reacted immediately with water leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals according to the reaction shown in eqs 4 and 5 the obtained results indicate that oh is the main reactive species which causes degradation of dnom and inactivation of microorganisms in these photocatalytic experiments 3 3 removal of dnoms tannic acid mainly derived from plants is considered to be a dnom in water and will be used as a model for dnoms in drinking water in our experiments fig 5 a show the uv spectra of tannic acid at different time intervals during the disinfection experiment and its normalized curve fig 5b it is clear that the concentration of tannic acid decreases with time about 99 removal of tannic acid was achieved after 5 h of solar irradiation while there was no change of the tannic concentration of the samples which had been kept in darkness the reactions occurring on the solid liquid interface surfaces were described by langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model as in eq 11 53 54 11 r0 d c d t k r k c e q 1 k c e q this model could be applied for photocatalytic degradation for organic compounds in water where r0 is the rate of disappearance of the organic substances kr is the rate limiting step at maximum coverage under the given experimental condition k is the reactant adsorption constant and ceq is the equilibrium bulk solute concentration in the case when kceq 1 the equation is transformed into zero order limiting step rate expression 12 12 c c0 k in the case when kceq 1 eq 10 is transformed to first order limiting step expression lnct c0 kt so the degradation of tannic acid was kinetically modeled using the zero and first order rate equations fig 5 c d the degradation data for tannic acid shows the best fit to the first order rate equation with r2 0 98 and the degradation rate constant of 0 83 m h the degradation of tannic acid is affected by hydroxyl radicals oh generated in the drinking water by cu2o nrs exposed to direct solar radiation the values toc and cod analyses confirm the removal and mineralization of organic material from water 3 32 the obtained results showed that the toc values decreased from 31 ppm to 2 1 ppm at the end of photocatalytic experiments the results of cod reduction are showed in fig 5e the percentage reduction of cod values shows the same trend as uv vis spectroscopic fig 5a the results obtained showed that the mineralization is slow at the beginning of photocatalytic degradation of tannic acid also 93 percent mineralization was achieved at the end of photocatalytic experiments 3 4 inactivation of bacteria e coli for the investigation of e coli inactivation 50 ml of e coli suspension 7820 cfu was placed in a sealed glass container with 1 1 10 cm2 cu2o nrs sheet and exposed to direct solar radiation samples were collected at regular time intervals and analyzed for e coli content fig 6 a shows the e coli content plotted against time for these experiments it is clear that the e coli concentration decreases with increasing time and complete inactivation was attained after 8 h inactivation increases with increasing hydroxyl radical concentration in the suspension similar results have been found for e coli inactivation using titanium oxide photocatalyst and uv radiation 55 56 in our experiments first order kinetics was found to be the best fit for the inactivation rate data fig 6b with a rate constant of 0 845 cfu h it also confirms that oh radicals serve as the main oxidant and are capable of inactivating microorganisms including viruses bacteria spores and protozoa 57 these hydroxyl radicals can cause cellular damage through lipid and protein oxidation reactions 55 it is believed that the generated reactive oh radical makes the oxidative damage to the e coli cellular components 58 59 the schematic diagram of the antibacterial mechanism is shown in fig 7 the inactivation of e coli could also be confirmed by tracking k ion concentration in the bacteria suspension during photocatalytic inactivation processes 59 during inactivation k leaks from the cell membrane and its concentration is considered to be an indicator of bacterial inactivation 60 fig 8 a shows the concentration of k ion of the solution at different inactivation intervals it is clear that the k concentration in solution increases with time this could be explained as follows the diffusion of k from cytoplasm indicates damage to the cell membrane the cell membrane of microorganisms is cell walls composed of an outer membrane and a peptide glycine organic component in addition to a na and k pump used in atp production during the inactivation process the na k pump ceases to function due to the collapse of the cell membrane damage damaging the production of atp in the cell 60 similar results have been obtained for the inactivation of e coli with red phosphorus photocatalyst under visible light 59 the copper ion concentration was continuously measured during the bacterial inactivation processes this was conducted to assess the stability of the prepared cu2o nrs against photochemical corrosion and to monitor the safety of the treated drinking water fig 8b shows the change in copper ion concentration during the inactivation process from this figure it is clear that the copper ion concentration increases at the early stage of e coli inactivation this may be attributed to the partial dissolution of those parts of cu2o nrs sheet which were not completely covered by the carbon layer 61 a parallel set of photocatalytic bacterial deactivation experiments was performed under conditions of darkness to confirm that the inactivation of e coli during solar radiation exposure was due to attack by hydroxyl radicals rather than factors such as i adhesion on the catalyst surface 62 or ii attack by copper metal either from the surface or from trace cu ion in solution 63 no change of e coli bacteria counts was observed in the experiments conducted in darkness this confirms that the inactivation of bacteria is mainly due to attack by hydroxyl radicals the e coli inactivation and dnom removal are summarized and shown schematically in fig 9 3 5 ionic concentrations in the deactivated drinking water samples the main drawback of the current technology for drinking water disinfection is the generation of anions in the water especially the inorganic dbb s bromate bro3 iodate io3 chlorate clo2 and chlorite clo one of the e coli inactivation experiments on drinking water was followed by an analysis of a range of anions using ion chromatography ic 90 dionex at the end of the photocatalytic experiment the analysis results are given in table 1 it is clear that there was a slight change in the concentration of nitrate and bicarbonate as a result of the photocatalysis process no inorganic dbb s were detected in the analysis in addition ph changed as a result of the inactivation process even though the disinfection experiments had been performed in closed containers the slight change of ph and bicarbonate may be attributed to the mineralization of leaking organic matter leached from the e coli bacteria during the deactivation processes 64 3 6 recycling and reusability the durability and stability of the prepared cu2o nrs were studied this was carried out by measuring the efficiency of producing hydroxyl radical and degradation of tannic acid the results of recycling are showed in fig 10 a b it is clear that the efficiency for producing hydroxyl radical is stable also 97 of degradation was obtained after five cycles this results shows that prepared photocatalyst catalyst could be used for five cycles with good stability so far commonly used heterogeneous photocatalysis for disinfection and dnom have been investigated mostly in laboratories however cu2onrs could be used in small scale by people who do not have access to drinking water services living in rural areas as it is simple safe do not need electrical source and no maintenance is required it could be used by placing cupper sheet covered with cu2onrs in transparent vessel to direct solar radiation for a period of time 65 it can also be applied on the smaller scale near storage tanks at homes where the water may have been infected within the distribution network before arriving at the consumers taps 66 additionally cu2o nrs in comparison with the popular photocatalysts such as tio2 zno bismuth carbon mos2 g c3n4 based photocatalysts black phosphorus and metal organic frameworks if they are used either in single form or as part of heterojunction shows superior properties as it is easier to scale up for real application good stability inexpensive visible light active and high efficiency for disinfection and removal of dnom 67 68 4 conclusions this study introduces a novel safe and cheap method for drinking water disinfection using solar radiation the method employs copper metal a cheap and abundant resource for the preparation of a photocatalyst cu2o nrs the method takes advantage of a clean renewable sustainable and cheap source of energy solar radiation for the generation of hydroxyl radical active species the presence of the reactive oh species in photocatalyst disinfected waters was confirmed and quantified the waters were also assayed for the formation of any inorganic dbb s during e coli inactivation the prepared photocatalyst can be used effectively to remove dnom which is the precursor of organic dbb s found in the traditional disinfection methods the prepared photocatalyst can be used for pathogen inactivation e coli was used as a tested pathogen in this study the prepared cu2o nrs photocatalyst can be reused for five cycles of e coli inactivation and dnom removal finally it should be noted that this method has been tested so far on only one bacterial species e coli and one nom compound tannic acid in non continuous flow further trials in continuous flow are needed to be conducted additionally the potential to remove other dnom s such as humic acid needs to be explored furthermore systematic studies on the formation of organic dbb s are needed technical improvements in covering the cu2o nrs with a carbon layer will reduce or prevent the release of copper ions into drinking water during the treatment process

comammox nitrite oxidizing bacteria anoxic chemolithoautotrophic biofilm 1 introduction water is one of the vital substances on the earth s surface for the survival of the living organism the demand for pure water is increasing with the growth in the global human population and urbanization various natural water bodies like rivers streams coastal zones and estuaries are the most productive part of the ecosystems due to various anthropogenic activities the volume of the wastewater is increasing proportionally 1 wastewater effluent contains pathogens inorganic compounds organic material and macroscopic pollutants an increase in the nutrients leads to the growth of bacteria and algae which increases the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the aquatic ecosystem this leads to decrease in the water clarity in water bodies causing threats to biodiversity habitat loss food chain disruption and eutrophication 2 eutrophication affects the zooplanktons and the entire food web the nitrogen is present in different forms as ammonia nitrites and nitrates into the water bodies presence of varying oxides of nitrogen and ammonia lead to the change in the ph and dissolved oxygen for aquatic life 2 3 ammonia is one of the major pollutants in freshwater which contributes to water pollution it is highly toxic in nature that is colourless alkaline gas and readily soluble in water 4 unionized ammonia is harmful to the organisms in the marine world 3 accumulation of the nitrogen content in the water bodies lead to nutrient pollution affecting the aquatic ecosystem nitrogen pollutants in the form of ammonia and nitrates pose various health risks if it is present in the drinking water it causes suffocation irritation of throat and eyes so it is necessary to reduce and remove the ammonia content in water 5 ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n is used in measuring the quantity of ammonia ions present in water or waste solvents 2 ammonia is found naturally in environment blended in air soil and water ammonia is the second most manufactured chemical in quantity next to sulphuric acid in the world there are two major sources of ammoniacal waste in water bodies 1 anthropogenic activities which includes a municipal effluent discharge b agricultural runoff containing fertilizers c industries like pharmaceuticals plastics explosives textiles pesticides dyes and other chemical industries 2 natural sources which includes a nitrogen fixation b acid rain c excretion of ammonia waste from animals 6 3 7 10 ammonia is highly soluble and reactive gas even at very low level ammonia is toxic to aquatic animals as per epa united states environmental protection agency 2013 recommendation 1 9 mg l tan causes chronic toxicity and 17 mg l tan causes acute toxicity not only aquatic ammonia also affects terrestrial plants and animals including human being ammonia from wastewater is removed by the physical chemical and biological methods physio chemical technologies for nitrogen removal from wastewaters include various techniques like ion exchange reverse osmosis breakpoint chlorination and dechlorination using granular activated carbon 5 the most traditional and cost effective way of ammonia removal is by the microbial method traditional microbial method involves using microbes for nitrification and denitrification process nitrifying bacteria example like nitrosomonas and nitrobacter helps in the conversion of ammonia to nitrous and nitric oxides denitrifying bacteria like proteobacteria and paracoccus denitrificans convert the nitrogen oxides to dinitrogen anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox and complete ammonia oxidation comammox are newly discovered processes of ammonia removal in anammox process microbes convert ammonia directly to nitrogen in the presence of nitrous oxide it is a cost effective and environmentally friendly process comammox is a two step process involving chemolithoautotrophic bacteria it includes nitrification of ammonia to nitrate and nitrite 11 nitrospira species are most common bacteria involved in comammox process this review explains the anammox and comammox processes and detailed on bacteria involved in these processes these processes can help in developing technology for faster reduction of ammonia from wastewaters by cost effective methods the main objective of this review article is to provide a comprehensive view on

the nitrogen cycle e the coupling of anammox and comammox and its impact in faster ammonia reduction in wastewaters this review will be useful for understanding various processes involved in ammonia reduction and development of novel technology by combining the anammox and comammox process for efficient ammonia reduction from wastewater 2 habitat and abundance of anammox and comammox 2 1 habitat and abundance of anammox the bacteria involved in anaerobic ammonia oxidation are ubiquitous in the environment these bacteria belong to the phylum planctomycetes 12 15 there are 19 anammox species identified till now belonging to 5 genera table 1 among these only ten could be enriched these bacteria grow in a ph range of 6 8 8 5 neither in an acidic or basic environment anammox bacteria are abundant in both marine and freshwater ecosystems these are also observed in reactors used for wastewater treatment and paddy fields in recent studies it was observed that these bacteria could be enriched faster in groundwater than the demineralized water anammox bacteria are chemolithoautotrophic which can utilize metals and trace elements present in the ground water they are slow growing autotrophic bacteria whose doubling time varies from 11 to 22 days anammox bacteria from marine water and freshwater grow at different temperature range in marine waters these bacteria grow at a temperature range of 15 c 25 c and in freshwater these bacteria show maximum activation at 37 c usually ranging from 27 c 37 c 13 five anammox genera listed that have been discovered so far table 1 since anammox are un culturable techniques like qpcr and fish are used in the quantification and abundance measurement of anammox bacteria 12 16 studies show that anammox population varies in the sediment samples from different places and it get affected by the pollution abundance data obtained by qpcr of anammox specific gene hzo and 16 s rdna range from 1 19 104 to 5 9 106 copies g of sediment 17 18 there may be more than one copy of hzo gene in bacteria cell hence the abundance calculated based on hzo gene may not be accurate but this has wider coverage for all the species of anammox scalindua jettenia brocadia anammoxoglobus bacterial species are abundant in the yellow river delta and kuenenia east china 19 while all five known species namely brocadia kuenenia scalindua jettenia and anammoxoglobus spices are reported from east china 20 co occurrence of anammox with methane oxidizing bacteria has been reported from the paddy fields due to water logging anoxic condition develops in paddy fields suitable for anammox bacteria 21 not only from mesophilic habitat anammox are also reported from the thermophilic environment like oil fields in china 22 23 2 2 structure of anammox bacteria anammox bacteria possess a unique characteristic in their structure and biology the cytoplasm in anammox bacteria is composed of three compartments that are separated by a single bilayer membrane the three bound compartmental cells from inside outwards are anammoxosome riboplasm and paryphoplasm 25 anammoxosome is a specialized organelle composed of a single bilayer membrane in anammox bacteria providing a place for metabolism 12 28 a proton motive force established over the anammoxosome membrane during an anammox reaction help in atp production in the riboplasm 29 anammoxosome membrane prevents the bacteria from the proton diffusion and transitional toxicity naturally occurring ladderane lipids are present in the bacterial membranes with an organic molecule containing two or more fused cyclobutane rings 12 28 as anammox could not be cultured as pure isolate the information about genome were obtained in bits and fragments recently the genome of candidatus jettina is constructed from the metagenomic study of anammox granules genome is 3 9 mbp long containing 3970 putative protein coding genes involved in autotrophic carbon fixation and anammox metabolism genes for 16 s 23 s rrna and 45 trna have also been identified high diversity in nitrite reductase genes have been reported among anammox for example some anammox bacteria contain cytochrome cd type nitrite reductase nirs other have copper containing nirk some anammox lack both nirs and nirk and use hydroxylamine dependent anammox mechanism using un known nitrite reductase 30 31 anammox bacteria are enriched in bioreactors like sequencing batch reactor 32 34 fluidized bed 35 fixed bed membrane reactor 36 fixed film reactors 37 38 up flow anaerobic sludge bed 39 33 rotating biological contactor 40 granular sludge based reactor 41 107 42 moving bed biofilm reactor 43 and integrated fixed biofilm activated sludge reactor 44 29 granular sludge based reactor showed that the mixing of the reactor content was facile and the volumetric loading rate of the reactor is higher with the slow growth of the anammox bacteria biomass retention is efficient which causes the natural growth of biofilm 42 anammox bacteria grow as consortia along with other microbes in granular form in the microscopic observation the anammox bacterial growth is seen in the middle of the granules and the smaller fraction of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob growth on the outer shell of the granules 45 these granules are bright red carmine calamine to pale red or black in color anammox bacteria can be observed as red colour growth which is due to the high content of cytochrome and the colour fades away to black with the reduction of heme c 29 anammox bacteria are slow growers for every 11 20 days the cells double in situ conditions reduce the doubling time and these microbes can thrive at deficient substrate concentration anammox are obligate anaerobes and oxygen sensitive their metabolism is reversibly inhibited if the oxygen is above 2μm these are also chemolithoautotrophic which are capable of oxidizing ammonia to nitrogen gas using nitrate as an electron acceptor 46 these bacteria require a period of 90 200 days for enrichment in a limiting condition when provided with a feed of ammonia nitrite nitrate and bicarbonate 28 the anammox bacteria isolated and identified from

nitrification reactor of municipal wastewater treatment plant 61 physiological data including ammonia oxidation kinetics 66 metabolic versatility 11 and comparative genomic analysis 59 revealed that comammox organisms functionally outcompete other canonical nitrifiers under highly oligotrophic condition 57 the anammox and the comammox process is differentiated table 4 2 4 structure of comammox bacteria the pure cultures of comammox bacteria like nitrospira inopinata ca n uzonensis observed under the scanning electron microscope are found to be slightly curved or spiral shaped and few were round shaped in size with 0 2 0 7 μm in width and 0 7 2 μm in length 59 66 these cells are enclosed by a multi layered envelope composed of a cytoplasmic membrane and an outer membrane the membrane is composed of storage compounds like glycogen and polyphosphate as deposits nitrospira inopinata is enriched in autotrophic nutrient media which is rich in ammonia content they are usually chemolithoautotrophic 67 these microbes grow well in aggregates as biofilms or in a suspended growth system these biofilms produce a network of the extracellular polymeric surface which is composed of 50 90 of total organic matter 66 comammox bacteria are enriched in rotating biological contractors 68 sequencing batch reactor 55 and moving bed biofilm reactor 56 the comammox bacteria isolated and

anaerobic condition includes denitrification and anammox processes anammox is a single step process involved in the conversion of ammonia to nitrogen in the presence of nitrite 28 hydrazine synthase hzs hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo are the enzymes involved in the energy metabolism of the anammox process 24 gene encoding hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo is isolated from several cultures belonging to the anammox enriched bacteria it belongs to the octaheme cytochrome c hydroxylamine oxidoreductase protein family it plays a vital part in the anammox biochemical

conversion of ammonia to nitrite anammox bacteria exclusively synthesize hydrazine which acts as principal reductant in nature the electron obtained in the hydrazine oxidation is transferred to the cytochrome bc1 complex it carries the electrons towards nitrite reduction and hydrazine synthesis a proton motive force is created when the protons are translocated across a membrane system which is coupled by the electron transfer 28 ca kuenenia stuttgartiennia is an anammox bacteria has a remarkable property of generating its own electron acceptor and donor by converting nitrate into nitrite and ammonia 73 anammox process has been studied broadly from lab scale to industrial scale the anammox method is widely used in sewage treatment plants and conventional wastewater treatment plants in conservative wastewater treatment systems for the removal of nitrogen a lot of energy is utilised to create an aerobic condition for bacterial nitrification a less energy intensive substitute method involving anaerobic ammonia oxidation can be used 74 77 the list of species involved in anammox process are listed table 5 3 2 enzymes and the mechanism involved in the chemical reaction of comammox in 1890 winogradsky discovered that nitrification includes two successive steps by two distinct groups of bacteria like ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria phylogenetically the chemolithoautotrophic aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are not closely related 58 kinetic theory of the optimal design of the metabolic pathway explains that there has been maximum production of atp with the division of labour of microorganisms reducing the pathway length increases the growth yield the higher growth yield of the bacteria would be beneficial for cultivation of bacteria in clonal clusters in the form of biofilms recently discovered process of complete ammonia oxidation shows that single organism is capable of performing both the reactions of converting ammonia to nitrite and nitrate due to the unique metabolic functionality and diverse presence these bacteria are used in biological engineering design and process 56 79 energy yield for complete nitrification is 349 kj mole the same as that of two step process of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate oxidation 275 kj mole and 74 kj mole respectively the growth and energy yield are more in using the organisms involved in complete nitrification than the incomplete ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria which could be due to the competition of the complete nitrifiers 11 ammonia oxidation n h 3 a m o a n o 2 g º 275 kj mol nitrite oxidation n o 2 n x r n o 3 g º 74 kj mol nitrospira plays a critical role in nitrification few species of nitrospira and their habitats are listed table 6 80 the comammox species can grow in highly lithotrophic conditions where the nutrient and do supply is very low 61 it is observed that in the drinking water systems comammox outnumbered the aob 59 106 conventional nitrification process by aob and nob is aerobic oxidation and in anoxic anaerobic condition enzymes of nob get deactivated 106 therefore energy intensive aeration is required comammox flourish in low do anoxic condition hence nitrification becomes more efficient comammox enzyme has higher affinity for ammonia compare to aob enzymes therefore it overtakes the nitrification and subsequently dominates the system 60 66 enrichment of nitrospira is conspicuous these are formed in the form of microbial biofilm these are enriched in mineral media rich in ammonia and bicarbonate as the sole source of energy 80 among the species of nitrospira identified till date only candidatus nitrospira inopinata has higher affinity for ammonia compared to other ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea it enables them to perform significant ecological process in natural and engineered environment 81 comammox are considered to be unculturable thermophilic nitrospira members nitrospira inopinata is the first cultured comammox species they are even grown in anoxic denitrification tanks with very little dissolved oxygen content below 0 2 mg o2 l 82 these are present in microcolonies flocs and biofilms biofilms are the clusters of microbial species growing on a surface area producing extracellular polymeric substance eps eps helps in the attachment to the surface and matrix formation biofilms are extensively used in the wastewater treatment and the improvement of nitrogen removal the nitrogen removal is more efficient in the biofilms rather than the activated sludge candidatus nitrospira nitrosoa is enriched in sequencing batch reactors that were operated and sustained in cyclic anoxic or anaerobic and microaerobic conditions in various operational stages 83 85 comammox bacteria can be enhanced by batch scales and chemo statically all the known comammox are the members of the genus nitrospira possess a full genetic complement for both ammonia and nitrite oxidation 61 enzymes involved in the comammox process are a amo ammonia monooxygenase a transmembrane enzyme plays a vital role in the conversion of ammonia to ammonia hydroxide b hzo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase converts ammonia hydroxide to nitrite in the periplasm c nor nitrate oxidoreductase a membrane associated enzyme oxidizes nitrite to nitrate 28 the species and enzymes involved in comammox process are listed table 7 the growth and the phylogenetic classification of the comammox bacterial species are analysed through metagenomic sequencing the metagenomic evidence proved the presence of these enzymes in the comammox species from a pilot scale to wastewater treatment plants these comammox bacteria play a significant role in the ammonia reduction to nitrate 4

various enzymes like narg nirs nirk nor and nos some of the enzymes like nirk nirs involved in anammox process are orthologous to enzymes involved in denitrification process in eq 3 we can see the ortholog of anammox and denitrifying genes in a combined anammox and partial denitrification processed shows a faster and major ammonia reduction than the separate anammox and partial denitrification process 86 87 co existence of microorganisms like thauera candidatus anammoximicrobium and pseudomonas contribute to simultaneous sludge fermentation denitrification and anammox 37 38 candidatus scalindua is an anammox bacterial species it has the nir s gene which is involved in the denitrification process few other uncultured anammox bacterial species also have the presence of nir k gene 88 89 enzymes like ammonia monooxygenase gene and nitrite reductase gene contain microbial species like nitrospira europaea eutropha nitrospira oligotropha and betaproteobacteria help in faster ammonia reduction 78 the current perspectives show the homology of nitrogen cycle and anammox process 90 5 coupling of anammox process with partial nitrification and denitrification processes the conventional method of ammonia reduction includes nitrification and denitrification process in nitrification process the ammonia is oxidized by aob and nob to nitrite and nitrate respectively nitrate is further reduced to nitrogen with the help of denitrifiers the ammonia reduction can be enhanced by coupling of various processes with the anammox process anammox process was first identified in the denitrifying fluidized bed reactor 35 91 anammox and ammonia oxidizing bacterial species coexisted in the environment as well as in wastewater treatment reactors enriched with paddy field wastewater sewage waters and tannery wastewaters 88 in this process anaerobic autotrophs converts ammonia directly to gaseous n2 in presence of no2 without producing toxic intermediate nox the nitrate produced from partial nitrification is used in both anammox and the denitrification process genes involved in both of these processes show partial similarity 92 93 coupling of denitrification process with anammox help in producing carbon source and substrates for the anammox bacteria the partial denitrification engrosses low do while consuming organic carbon which provides anoxic condition for anammox the combined process helps in total nitrogen removal of 84 93 86 partial denitrification process coupled with anammox process helps in lowering the nitrite production reduced oxygen consumption and minimal sludge production 11 the comparison of various methods involved in the coupling of anammox process is explained table 8 6 coupling of anammox and comammox an innovative approach nitrogen cycle

oxidizing bacteria nob anammox amx and comammox cmx bacteria these bacteria utilize common substrates like ammonia nitrite and inorganic carbon 56 97 anammox process has shown a significant reduction of ammonia when there is a selective enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and anammox bacteria anammox enrichment is also done with the anammox pellets which is used as a seed for inoculation metagenomic studies showed that in an anammox rich wastewater treatment plant system there is a growth of complete ammonia oxidizers comammox nitrospira these dominated the aob which were present in anaerobic conditions and it was also found that comammox organisms helped in effective ammonia removal 98 comammox bacteria is homologous to the ammonia oxidizing bacteria in metagenomic studies it was observed that ca n inopinata possess enzymes of ammonia oxidation amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase the hao gene which is one of the vital enzymes is involved in the anammox process 11 in reference to paper 56 the combined growth of anammox and comammox bacteria promoted the growth of biofilms these bacteria possessing genes like amx cmx amoa and hao b are involved in biological nitrogen removal 56 a novel approach of combining the anammox and comammox process in a sludge digestor liquor has been a cost effective process in nitrogen reduction in a sequencing biofilm batch reactor sbbr the combination of the three processes as ammonia oxidizing bacteria chitinophaeae anammox bacteria candidatus kuenemia and comammox bacteria nitrospira helped in the reduction of ammoniacal nitrogen the average efficiency of nitrogen removal was 98 which included 55 of partial nitrification 18 28 of anammox and 26 62 comammox process with comparison to traditional nitrification anammox is efficient as there is no external carbon source and is cost effective 55 the recent studies 56 shows that cmx has better growth yields than the specific growth rates of aob and nob the combination of anammox and comammox species in the biofilm lead to quicker biological nitrogen removal 56 it outcompetes the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria under certain conditions 99 the coupling of comammox partial nitrification with anammox helps significantly in the reduction of aeration external carbon source and sludge formation the presence of the biofilm induces the faster growth of anammox and ammonia reduction 99 the blending of both the anammox and comammox process would be further developed from the laboratory scale to large scale wastewater treatment plants innovation method involved in coupling of two process is cost effective conception and environmentally friendly to the scientific community in ammonia reduction from wastewater nitrogen cycle is one of the biogeochemical cycles which plays a major role in the ecosystem discovery of new processes like anammox and comammox made it clear that nitrogen cycle is more complex than it was thought to maintain ecological balance the excessive nitrogen pollution in water is removed to prevent eutrophication therefore it is necessary to understand the relationship of the various process in nitrogen cycle anammox very effectively converts ammonia directly to gaseous n2 in presence of no2 without producing toxic intermediate nox recent review on coupling of anammox and partial denitrification 98 has given updates of the process 6 1 advantages of coupling of comammox and anammox processes the coupling of comammox with the anammox is explained in the below equation where the nitrite produced from the oxidation of ammonia by comammox is utilised by the anammox bacteria in converting the ammonia to nitrogen low do favours comammox prevalence in reactor therefore the aeration is not required as needed for ammonia removal with canonical aob nob system hence the energy cost for aeration can be minimized 61 the solid retention time srt is higher for comammox as they are prevalent in attached growth and suspended phase 100 growth rate is slower and higher growth yield compared to aob and nob therefore adapted to the environment with low substrate fluxes the sludge formation will be less 60 higher ammonia removal efficiency comammox has higher affinity for ammonia compared to aob therefore influent with low ammonia concentration can also be treated 60 66 emission of greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide n2o nitrous acid hno2 nitrogen dioxide no2 and co2 can be reduced by use of comammox these are obligate intermediates of aerobic ammonia oxidation 96 comammox nitrospira has a competitive advantage over canonical ammonia oxidizers as they completely oxidize ammonia by a single microorganism in comparison to two step oxidations by aob and nob comammox dominates in nutrient depleted environment like ammonia depleted biofilms microbial aggregates drinking water purification system and low nutrient waste water treatment systems 58 the kinetics studies of ammonia oxidation in comammox bacterium nitrosopumilus inopinata showed higher ammonia affinity compared to aob 66 the enriched comammox nitrospira species 11 can use urea as an alternative to ammonia for energy source and biosynthesis enabling comammox organisms to thrive in habitats with low or fluctuating urea concentrations such as fertilized agricultural soils wwtps and many aquatic and terrestrial systems 57 stable nitrite produced by comammox process is utilised by the anammox to reduced ammonia to nitrogen the coupling of anammox with comammox enhances the nitrogen removal process by reduced infrastructure cost and simple operation 7 conclusions ammonia is a major pollutant of environment soil water as well as air several microbial ammonia removal processes have been developed traditional understanding of ammonia removal process includes nitrification and denitrification nitrification is carried jointly by chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitric oxide oxidizing bacteria nob nitrification is followed by denitrification no3 to n2 through many intermediate steps carried out by chemo organo heterotrophic bacteria energetically this is very expensive process and produces several environment polluting gasses like n2o co2 and other nitrogen oxides since the discovery anammox process has attracted many scientists to explore its utility in treating ammonia rich waste water anammox is unique and a single step process where a particular bacterium helps in the conversion of ammonia to nitrogen in anoxic conditions without an external carbon source slow growth instability under variable inflow and availability of no2 are the limitations for use of anammox in water treatment plants combining other nitrite producing processes like canonical nitrification denitrification with anammox seems to be more effective an alternate shortcut can be made by combining comammox and anammox process comammox can do complete nitrification nh3 to no3 in a single organism which is energetically favourable in comparison to canonical nitrifiers further the accumulation of no2 can be avoided as anammox will utilize it for ammonia oxidation coupling of comammox and anammox processes will save the cost of aeration energy for nitrifiers and external carbon source for denitrifiers coupling of anammox process with comammox can help in overcoming the problems like influent composition more flexible conditions single reactor process effluent composition less toxic no n2o no2 this mechanism also helps in the faster enrichment of the microbes involved in the ammonia reduction from wastewater an eco friendly efficient and economical process can be developed by combining comammox and anammox processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare

for pure water is increasing with the growth in the global human population and urbanization various natural water bodies like rivers streams coastal zones and estuaries are the most productive part of the ecosystems due to various anthropogenic activities the volume of the wastewater is increasing proportionally 1 wastewater effluent contains pathogens inorganic compounds organic material and macroscopic pollutants an increase in the nutrients leads to the growth of bacteria and algae which increases the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the aquatic ecosystem this leads to decrease in the water clarity in water bodies causing threats to biodiversity habitat loss food chain disruption and eutrophication 2 eutrophication affects the zooplanktons and the entire food web the nitrogen is present in different forms as ammonia nitrites and nitrates into the water bodies presence of varying oxides of nitrogen and ammonia lead to the change in the ph and dissolved oxygen for aquatic life 2 3 ammonia is one of the major pollutants in freshwater which contributes to water pollution it is highly toxic in nature that is colourless alkaline gas and readily soluble in water 4 unionized ammonia is harmful to the organisms in the marine world 3 accumulation of the nitrogen content in the water bodies lead to nutrient pollution affecting the aquatic ecosystem nitrogen pollutants in the form of ammonia and nitrates pose various health risks if it is present in the drinking water it causes suffocation irritation of throat and eyes so it is necessary to reduce and remove the ammonia content in water 5 ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n is used in measuring the quantity of ammonia ions present in water or waste solvents 2 ammonia is found naturally in environment blended in air soil and water ammonia is the second most manufactured chemical in quantity next to sulphuric acid in the world there are two major sources of ammoniacal waste in water bodies 1 anthropogenic activities which includes a municipal effluent discharge b agricultural runoff containing fertilizers c industries like pharmaceuticals plastics explosives textiles pesticides dyes and other chemical industries 2 natural sources which includes a nitrogen fixation b acid rain c excretion of ammonia waste from animals 6 3 7 10 ammonia is highly soluble and reactive gas even at very low level ammonia is toxic to

and abundance of anammox the bacteria involved in anaerobic ammonia oxidation are ubiquitous in the environment these bacteria belong to the phylum planctomycetes 12 15 there are 19 anammox species identified till now belonging to 5 genera table 1 among these only ten could be enriched these bacteria grow in a ph range of 6 8 8 5 neither in an acidic or basic environment anammox bacteria are abundant in both marine and freshwater ecosystems these are also observed in reactors used for wastewater treatment and paddy fields in recent studies it was observed that these bacteria could be enriched faster in groundwater than the demineralized water anammox bacteria are chemolithoautotrophic which can utilize metals and trace elements present in the ground water they are slow growing autotrophic bacteria whose doubling time varies from 11 to 22 days anammox bacteria from marine water and freshwater grow at different temperature range in marine waters these bacteria grow at a temperature range of 15 c 25 c and in freshwater these bacteria show maximum activation at 37 c usually ranging from 27 c 37 c 13 five anammox genera listed that have been discovered so far table 1 since anammox are un culturable techniques like qpcr and fish are used in the quantification and abundance measurement of anammox bacteria 12 16 studies show that anammox population varies in the sediment samples from different places and it get affected by the pollution abundance data obtained by qpcr of anammox specific gene hzo and 16 s rdna range from 1 19 104 to 5 9 106 copies g of sediment 17 18 there may be more than one copy of hzo gene in bacteria cell hence the abundance calculated based on hzo gene may not be accurate but this has wider coverage for all the species of anammox scalindua jettenia brocadia anammoxoglobus bacterial species are abundant in the yellow river delta and kuenenia east china 19 while all five known species namely brocadia kuenenia scalindua jettenia and anammoxoglobus spices are reported from east china 20 co occurrence of anammox with methane oxidizing bacteria has been reported from the paddy fields due to water logging anoxic condition develops in paddy fields suitable for anammox bacteria 21 not only from mesophilic habitat anammox are also reported from the thermophilic environment like oil fields in china 22 23 2 2 structure of anammox bacteria anammox bacteria possess a unique characteristic in their structure and biology the cytoplasm in anammox bacteria is composed of three compartments that are separated by a single bilayer membrane the three bound compartmental cells from inside outwards are anammoxosome riboplasm and paryphoplasm 25 anammoxosome is a specialized organelle composed of a single bilayer membrane in anammox bacteria providing a place for metabolism 12 28 a proton motive force established over the anammoxosome membrane during an anammox reaction help in atp production in the riboplasm 29 anammoxosome membrane prevents the bacteria from the proton diffusion and transitional toxicity naturally occurring ladderane lipids are present in the bacterial membranes with an organic molecule containing two or more fused cyclobutane rings 12 28 as anammox could not be cultured as pure isolate the information about genome were obtained in bits and fragments recently the genome of candidatus jettina is constructed from the metagenomic study of anammox granules genome is 3 9 mbp long containing 3970 putative protein coding genes involved in autotrophic carbon fixation and anammox metabolism genes for 16 s 23 s rrna and 45 trna have also been identified high diversity in nitrite reductase genes have been reported among anammox for example some anammox bacteria contain cytochrome cd type nitrite reductase nirs other have copper containing nirk some anammox lack both nirs and nirk and use hydroxylamine dependent anammox mechanism using un known nitrite reductase 30 31 anammox bacteria are enriched in bioreactors like sequencing batch reactor 32 34 fluidized bed 35 fixed bed membrane reactor 36 fixed film reactors 37 38 up flow anaerobic sludge bed 39 33 rotating biological contactor 40 granular sludge based reactor 41 107 42 moving bed biofilm reactor 43 and integrated fixed biofilm activated sludge reactor 44 29 granular sludge based reactor showed that the mixing of the reactor content was facile and the volumetric loading rate of the reactor is higher with the slow growth of the anammox bacteria biomass retention is efficient which causes the natural growth of biofilm 42 anammox bacteria grow as consortia along with other microbes in granular form in the microscopic observation the anammox bacterial growth is seen in the middle of the granules and the smaller fraction of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob growth on the outer shell of the granules 45 these granules are bright red carmine calamine to pale red or black in color anammox bacteria can be observed as red colour growth which is due to the high content of cytochrome and the colour fades away to black with the reduction of heme c 29 anammox bacteria are slow growers for every 11 20 days the cells double in situ conditions reduce the doubling time and these microbes can thrive at deficient substrate concentration anammox are obligate anaerobes and oxygen sensitive their metabolism is reversibly inhibited if the oxygen is above 2μm these are also chemolithoautotrophic which are capable of oxidizing ammonia to nitrogen gas using nitrate as an electron acceptor 46 these bacteria require a period of 90 200 days for enrichment in a limiting condition when provided with a feed of ammonia nitrite nitrate and bicarbonate 28 the anammox bacteria isolated and identified from different habitats are listed table 2 2 3 habitat and abundance of comammox comammox is a process involved in the complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate by a single organism it has higher growth

like rice paddy fields and forest soils they are grown in freshwater habitats brackish lake sediments engineered systems like wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment systems 57 comammox organisms coexist with aoa aob and nob division of labour between aob and nob is challenged by complete ammonia oxidizers like nitrospira comammox are oligotrophic organisms which can grow in low nutrient conditions and convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate in drinking water treatment plants comammox outnumbered aob and helped in ammonia oxidation 59 the comammox microbes have more efficient carbon fixation pathway compared to aob and hence require less organic carbon 60 these are dominant ammonia oxidizers in the mainstream nitrification reactor with low dissolved oxygen 61

comammox bacteria varied from 1 0 108 copies ng 1 to 1 75 108 copies ng 1 are abundant in aoa amoa gene and aob amoa genes mostly found in the sewage discharged areas of the bioreactor plant 65 they grow in low dissolved oxygen conditions or partially oxic conditions 61 to prevent the growth of the phototrophic microorganisms they are grown in dark conditions 62 the pure cultures of comammox bacteria that are isolated and identified so far are 1 candidatus nitrospira inopinata 2 candidatus nitrospira nitrosoa 3 candidatus nitrospira nitrificans these bacteria can grow in extreme conditions from 22 c 56 c at a ph ranging from 6 to 8 5 11 comammox nitrospira has been identified in many engineered systems it was also found to be dominating the ammonia oxidizing community in a nitrification reactor of municipal wastewater treatment plant 61 physiological data including ammonia oxidation kinetics 66 metabolic versatility 11 and comparative genomic analysis 59 revealed that comammox organisms functionally outcompete other canonical nitrifiers under highly oligotrophic condition 57 the anammox and the comammox process is differentiated table 4 2 4 structure of comammox bacteria the pure cultures of comammox bacteria like nitrospira inopinata ca n uzonensis observed under the scanning electron microscope are found to be slightly curved or spiral shaped and few were round shaped in size with 0 2 0 7 μm in width and 0 7 2 μm in length 59 66 these cells are enclosed by a multi layered envelope composed of a cytoplasmic membrane and an outer membrane the membrane is composed of storage compounds like glycogen and polyphosphate as deposits nitrospira inopinata is enriched in autotrophic nutrient media which is rich in ammonia content they are usually chemolithoautotrophic 67 these microbes grow well in aggregates as biofilms or in a suspended growth system these biofilms produce a network of the extracellular polymeric surface which is composed of 50 90 of total organic matter 66 comammox bacteria are enriched in rotating biological contractors 68 sequencing batch reactor 55 and moving bed biofilm reactor 56 the comammox bacteria isolated and identified from different habitats are listed table 3 3 chemical reactions of anammox and comammox 3 1 enzymes and the mechanism involved in the chemical reaction of anammox nitrogen removal by in anaerobic condition includes denitrification and anammox processes anammox is a single step process involved in the conversion of ammonia to nitrogen in the presence of nitrite 28 hydrazine synthase hzs hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo are the enzymes involved in the energy metabolism of the anammox process 24 gene encoding hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo is isolated from several cultures belonging to the anammox enriched bacteria it belongs to the octaheme cytochrome c hydroxylamine oxidoreductase protein family it plays a vital part in the anammox biochemical process 22 23 fig 1 explains the different processes and the enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation the anammox pathway includes the following reactions 28 1 reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide n o 2

conversion of ammonia to nitrite anammox bacteria exclusively synthesize hydrazine which acts as principal reductant in nature the electron obtained in the hydrazine oxidation is transferred to the cytochrome bc1 complex it carries the electrons towards nitrite reduction and hydrazine synthesis a proton motive force is created when the protons are translocated across a membrane system which is coupled by the electron transfer 28 ca kuenenia stuttgartiennia is an anammox bacteria has a remarkable property of generating its own electron acceptor and donor by converting nitrate into nitrite and ammonia 73 anammox process has been studied broadly from lab scale to industrial scale the anammox method is widely used in sewage treatment plants and conventional wastewater treatment plants in conservative wastewater treatment systems for the removal of nitrogen a lot of energy is utilised to create an aerobic condition for bacterial nitrification a less energy intensive substitute method involving anaerobic ammonia oxidation can be used 74 77 the list of species involved in anammox process are listed table 5 3 2 enzymes and the mechanism involved in the chemical reaction of comammox in 1890 winogradsky discovered that nitrification includes two successive steps by two distinct groups of bacteria like ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria phylogenetically the chemolithoautotrophic aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are not closely related 58 kinetic theory of the optimal design of the metabolic pathway explains that there has been maximum production of atp with the division of labour of microorganisms reducing the pathway length increases the growth yield the higher growth yield of the bacteria would be beneficial for cultivation of bacteria in clonal clusters in the form of biofilms recently discovered process of complete ammonia oxidation shows that single organism is capable of performing both the reactions of converting ammonia to nitrite and nitrate due to the unique metabolic functionality and diverse presence these bacteria are used in biological engineering design and process 56 79 energy yield for complete nitrification is 349 kj mole the same as that of two step process of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate oxidation 275 kj mole and 74 kj mole respectively the growth and energy yield are more in using the organisms involved in complete nitrification than the incomplete ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria which could be due to the competition of the complete nitrifiers 11 ammonia

table 6 80 the comammox species can grow in highly lithotrophic conditions where the nutrient and do supply is very low 61 it is observed that in the drinking water systems comammox outnumbered the aob 59 106 conventional nitrification process by aob and nob is aerobic oxidation and in anoxic anaerobic condition enzymes of nob get deactivated 106 therefore energy intensive aeration is required comammox flourish in low do anoxic condition hence nitrification becomes more efficient comammox enzyme has higher affinity for ammonia compare to aob enzymes therefore it overtakes the nitrification and subsequently dominates the system 60 66 enrichment of nitrospira is conspicuous these are formed in the form of microbial biofilm these are enriched in mineral media rich in ammonia and bicarbonate as the sole source of energy 80 among the species of nitrospira identified till date only candidatus nitrospira inopinata has higher affinity for ammonia compared to other ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea it enables them to perform significant ecological process in natural and engineered environment 81 comammox are considered to be unculturable thermophilic nitrospira members nitrospira inopinata is the first cultured comammox species they are even grown in anoxic denitrification tanks with very little dissolved oxygen content below 0 2 mg o2 l 82 these are present in microcolonies flocs and biofilms biofilms are the clusters of microbial species growing on a surface area producing extracellular polymeric substance eps eps helps in the attachment to the surface and matrix formation biofilms are extensively used in the wastewater treatment and the improvement of nitrogen removal the nitrogen removal is more efficient in the biofilms rather than the activated sludge candidatus nitrospira nitrosoa is enriched in sequencing batch reactors that were operated and sustained in cyclic anoxic or anaerobic and microaerobic conditions in various operational stages 83 85 comammox bacteria can be enhanced by batch scales and chemo statically all the known comammox are the members of the genus nitrospira possess a full genetic complement for both ammonia and nitrite oxidation 61 enzymes involved in the comammox process are a amo ammonia monooxygenase a transmembrane enzyme plays a vital role in the conversion of ammonia to ammonia hydroxide b hzo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase converts ammonia hydroxide to nitrite in the periplasm c nor nitrate oxidoreductase a membrane associated enzyme oxidizes nitrite to nitrate 28 the species and enzymes involved in comammox process are listed table 7 the growth and the phylogenetic classification of the comammox bacterial species are analysed through metagenomic sequencing the metagenomic evidence proved the presence of these enzymes in the comammox species from a pilot scale to wastewater treatment plants these comammox bacteria play a significant role in the ammonia reduction to nitrate 4

various enzymes like narg nirs nirk nor and nos some of the enzymes like nirk nirs involved in anammox process are orthologous to enzymes involved in denitrification process in eq 3 we can see the ortholog of anammox and denitrifying genes in a combined anammox and partial denitrification processed shows a faster and major ammonia reduction than the separate anammox and partial denitrification process 86 87 co existence of microorganisms like thauera candidatus anammoximicrobium and pseudomonas contribute to simultaneous sludge fermentation denitrification and anammox 37 38 candidatus scalindua is an anammox bacterial species it has the nir s gene which is involved in the denitrification process few other uncultured anammox bacterial species also have the presence of nir k gene 88 89 enzymes like ammonia monooxygenase gene and nitrite reductase gene contain microbial species like nitrospira europaea eutropha nitrospira oligotropha and betaproteobacteria help in faster ammonia reduction 78 the current perspectives show the homology of nitrogen cycle and anammox process 90 5 coupling of anammox process with partial nitrification and denitrification processes the conventional method of ammonia reduction includes nitrification and denitrification process in nitrification process the ammonia is oxidized by aob and nob to nitrite and nitrate respectively nitrate is further reduced to nitrogen with the help of denitrifiers the ammonia reduction can be enhanced by coupling of various processes with the anammox process anammox process was first identified in the denitrifying fluidized bed reactor 35 91 anammox and ammonia oxidizing bacterial species coexisted in the environment as well as in wastewater treatment reactors enriched with paddy field wastewater sewage waters and tannery wastewaters 88 in this process anaerobic autotrophs converts ammonia directly to gaseous n2 in presence of no2 without producing toxic intermediate nox the nitrate produced from partial nitrification is used in both anammox and the denitrification process genes involved in both of these processes show partial similarity 92 93 coupling of denitrification process with anammox help in producing carbon source and substrates for the anammox bacteria the partial denitrification engrosses low do while consuming organic carbon which provides anoxic condition for anammox the combined process helps in total nitrogen removal of 84 93 86 partial denitrification process coupled with anammox process helps in lowering the nitrite production reduced oxygen consumption and minimal sludge production 11 the comparison of various methods involved in the coupling of anammox process is explained table 8 6 coupling of anammox and comammox an innovative approach nitrogen cycle

oxidizing bacteria nob anammox amx and comammox cmx bacteria these bacteria utilize common substrates like ammonia nitrite and inorganic carbon 56 97 anammox process has shown a significant reduction of ammonia when there is a selective enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and anammox bacteria anammox enrichment is also done with the anammox pellets which is used as a seed for inoculation metagenomic studies showed that in an anammox rich wastewater treatment plant system there is a growth of complete ammonia oxidizers comammox nitrospira these dominated the aob which were present in anaerobic conditions and it was also found that comammox organisms helped in effective ammonia removal 98 comammox bacteria is homologous to the ammonia oxidizing bacteria in metagenomic studies it was observed that ca n inopinata possess enzymes of ammonia oxidation amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase the hao gene which is one of the vital enzymes is involved in the anammox process 11 in reference to paper 56 the combined growth of anammox and comammox bacteria promoted the growth of biofilms these bacteria possessing genes like amx cmx amoa and hao b are involved in biological nitrogen removal 56 a novel approach of combining the anammox and comammox process in a sludge digestor liquor has been a cost effective process in nitrogen reduction in a sequencing biofilm batch reactor sbbr the combination of the three processes as ammonia oxidizing bacteria chitinophaeae anammox bacteria candidatus kuenemia and comammox bacteria nitrospira helped in the reduction of ammoniacal nitrogen the average efficiency of nitrogen removal was 98 which included 55 of partial nitrification 18 28 of anammox and 26 62 comammox process with comparison to traditional nitrification anammox is efficient as there is no external carbon source and is cost effective 55 the recent studies 56 shows that cmx has better growth yields than the specific growth rates of aob and nob the combination of anammox and comammox species in the biofilm lead to quicker biological nitrogen removal 56 it outcompetes the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria under certain conditions 99 the coupling of comammox partial nitrification with anammox helps significantly in the reduction of aeration external carbon source and sludge formation the presence of the biofilm induces the faster growth of anammox and ammonia reduction 99 the blending of both the anammox and comammox process would be further developed from the laboratory scale to large scale wastewater treatment plants innovation method involved in coupling of two process is cost effective conception and environmentally friendly to the scientific community in ammonia reduction from wastewater nitrogen cycle is one of the biogeochemical cycles which plays a major role in the ecosystem discovery of new processes like anammox and comammox made it clear that nitrogen cycle is more complex than it was thought to maintain ecological balance the excessive nitrogen pollution in water is removed to prevent eutrophication therefore it is necessary to understand the relationship of the various process in nitrogen cycle anammox very effectively converts ammonia directly to gaseous n2 in presence of no2 without producing toxic intermediate nox recent review on coupling of anammox and partial denitrification 98 has given updates of the process 6 1 advantages of coupling of comammox and anammox processes the coupling of comammox with the anammox is explained in the below equation where the nitrite produced from the oxidation of ammonia by comammox is utilised by the anammox bacteria in converting the ammonia to nitrogen low do favours comammox prevalence in reactor therefore the aeration is not required as needed for ammonia removal with canonical aob nob system hence the energy cost for aeration can be minimized 61 the solid retention time srt is higher for comammox as they are prevalent in attached growth and suspended phase 100 growth rate is slower and higher growth yield compared to aob and nob therefore adapted to the environment with low substrate fluxes the sludge formation will be less 60 higher ammonia removal efficiency comammox has higher affinity for ammonia compared to aob therefore influent with low ammonia concentration can also be treated 60 66 emission of greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide n2o nitrous acid hno2 nitrogen dioxide no2 and co2 can be reduced by use of comammox these are obligate intermediates of aerobic ammonia oxidation 96 comammox nitrospira has a competitive advantage over canonical ammonia oxidizers as they completely oxidize ammonia by a single microorganism in comparison to two step oxidations by aob and nob comammox dominates in nutrient depleted environment like ammonia depleted biofilms microbial aggregates drinking water purification system and low nutrient waste water treatment systems 58 the kinetics studies of ammonia oxidation in comammox bacterium nitrosopumilus inopinata showed higher ammonia affinity compared to aob 66 the enriched comammox nitrospira species 11 can use urea as an alternative to ammonia for energy source and biosynthesis enabling comammox organisms to thrive in habitats with low or fluctuating urea concentrations such as fertilized agricultural soils wwtps and many aquatic and terrestrial systems 57 stable nitrite produced by comammox process is utilised by the anammox to reduced ammonia to nitrogen the coupling of anammox with comammox enhances the nitrogen removal process by reduced infrastructure cost and simple operation 7 conclusions ammonia is a major pollutant of environment soil water as well as air several microbial ammonia removal processes have been developed traditional understanding of ammonia removal process includes nitrification and denitrification nitrification is carried jointly by chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitric oxide oxidizing bacteria nob nitrification is followed by denitrification no3 to n2 through many intermediate steps carried out by chemo organo heterotrophic bacteria energetically this is very expensive process and produces several environment polluting gasses like n2o co2 and other nitrogen oxides since the discovery anammox process has attracted many scientists to explore its utility in treating ammonia rich waste water anammox is unique and a single step process where a particular bacterium helps in the conversion of ammonia to nitrogen in anoxic conditions without an external carbon source slow growth instability under variable inflow and availability of no2 are the limitations for use of anammox in water treatment plants combining other nitrite producing processes like canonical nitrification denitrification with anammox seems to be more effective an alternate shortcut can be made by combining comammox and anammox process comammox can do complete nitrification nh3 to no3 in a single organism which is energetically favourable in comparison to canonical nitrifiers further the accumulation of no2 can be avoided as anammox will utilize it for ammonia oxidation coupling of comammox and anammox processes will save the cost of aeration energy for nitrifiers and external carbon source for denitrifiers coupling of anammox process with comammox can help in overcoming the problems like influent composition more flexible conditions single reactor process effluent composition less toxic no n2o no2 this mechanism also helps in the faster enrichment of the microbes involved in the ammonia reduction from wastewater an eco friendly efficient and economical process can be developed by combining comammox and anammox processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13583,fluoride can be removed from potable water by induced crystallization of fluorapatite fap however the properties of the original crystal seed using calcite as a continuous source of ca2 are not well defined this paper describes the effect of calcite surface regulation by phosphate groups on the form of fap that serves as the original crystal seed for the induced crystallization defluoridation the results show that when dissociated from phosphate groups h promotes ca2 dissolution from the surface of calcite although the kinetics of calcium dissolution by phosphate acid and phosphate salt are different the results of molecular dynamic md simulations show that phosphate has a strong binding effect on the surface of calcite which suits the subsequent fap coating the sodium ions na supplied by sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 inhibit the recrystallization of calcium carbonate caco3 and promote the continuous release of ca2 from calcite the ca2 ions then promote the nucleation and growth of fap on the surface of the calcite scanning electron microscope sem images indicate that rose petal shaped fap forms on the surface of calcite with a coating time of 6 24 h which provides growth sites for induced crystallization defluorination the fluorapatite coated calcite fcc with a coating time of 6 h and an fap coverage of the calcite surface of 82 86 was selected as the seed crystal the fixed bed induced crystallization reactor was run for 700 bed volumes bv with this seed crystal and successfully removed 84 3 99 8 of the fluoride keywords fluoride removal fluorapatite coated calcite seed crystal calcium source induced crystallization 1 introduction fluorine is one of the most essential trace elements for the human body and is indispensable for growth and metabolism however excessive ingestion of fluoride can cause health problems such as dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis 1 fluorosis primarily caused by long term excessive intake of fluoride from drinking water has become a major threat to human health in many countries including china india pakistan turkey iraq afghanistan mexico and thailand 1 3 the guideline values for fluoride suggested by the world health organization who and china are 1 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l respectively 4 therefore treating groundwater with a high fluoride content and reducing the fluoride concentration to a level suitable for human drinking and health is of paramount importance there are many treatment methods for fluoride removal including adsorption ion exchangers precipitation membrane electrocoagulation and electro dialysis 5 among these adsorption and precipitation are commonly adopted because of their high defluoridation capacities of late induced crystallization a technique based on the precipitation of fluorapatite fap ca5 po4 3f using a seed crystal i e phosphate rock pr has received attention and is considered an efficient and environmentally friendly method for removing fluoride from drinking water the singular advantages of this technology are that the seed crystal pr can be used repeatedly for defluoridation by induced crystallization and the spent pr can be recycled in the phosphorus fertilizer industry as a stable phosphate resource 6 7 natural pr contains both fap and calcite which makes it a perfect seed crystal option for fluoride removal fluidized bed crystallization technology with natural pr as a seed crystal can achieve a constant fluoride effluent of 0 4 0 9 mg l 8 unfortunately phosphorus is a non renewable resource and it is estimated that global rock phosphate reserves about 70 million tonnes worldwide reported in 2018 could be depleted in 50 years 9 11 thus it is necessary to seek an alternative crystal seed material for defluoridation to replace natural pr given that the induced crystallization process mainly occurs on the surface of apatite the main component of pr it seems feasible to establish an interface microenvironment to reduce the consumption of fap and overcome the defect that the enclosed p inside the pr particles cannot be effectively utilized our previous investigation into fluoride removal by induced crystallization using fap calcite as seed crystals showed that neither fap nor calcite individually yielded a satisfactory fluoride removal rate but using fap coupled with calcite showed a high removal rate of 94 7 7 kanno et al showed that calcite could provide ideal catalytic activity because of the strong interaction of phosphate po4 3 with calcite surfaces in hydrogen chloride hcl and sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 solutions calcite is also a readily available relatively inexpensive source of calcium ions ca2 for hydroxyapatite synthesis in the presence of externally added po4 3 12 therefore fluorapatite coated calcite fcc which can be generated by coating granular calcite with reactive micrometer sized fap may be a feasible strategy to achieve defluoridation by fluorapatite induced crystallization in this study we investigated the mechanism of calcite surface regulation by different phosphate species and evaluated the defluoridation efficiency with induced crystallization we studied the influence of the phosphate group state the cover ratio of fap on calcite and the coating time on the synthesis of fcc molecular dynamics md simulation was used to calculate the interaction energy between phosphate and the calcite surface scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectronic spectroscopy xps were employed to characterize the raw calcite and fcc the surface regulation mechanism of calcite for defluoridation by fap induced crystallization was demonstrated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw calcite with a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm used in this research was obtained from hezhou guangxi province the characteristics of the calcite are shown in fig 1 this raw material was composed of calcite with a small amount of calcium oxide the calcite particles were rinsed with deionized water di water followed by drying at 110 c for 12 h all the reagents used were produced by tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china reagents were analytical reagent grade used without further purification with the exception of sodium fluoride naf which was guaranteed reagent grade naf and sodium chloride nacl were dissolved in di water to prepare a 0 5 mm fluoride solution with 0 01 m nacl as a background electrolyte the dissolution of ca2 from calcite was investigated using solutions containing 1 5 mm hcl sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate nah2po4 2h2o potassium dihydrate phosphate kh2po4 and hydrogen phosphate h3po4 and one nah2po4 h3po4 mixed solution contained 1 2 mm nah2po4 2h2o and 0 3 mm h3po4 2 2 synthesis of fcc the reaction device shown in fig 2 was constructed of plexiglass with an effective height of 1 0 m and an inner diameter of 5 0 cm the raw calcite particles were placed in the reactor to a height of 30 cm fluoride containing raw water and the desired concentration of the nah2po4 solution were pumped to the top of the reactor at certain flow rates i e raw water 6 0 l h by peristaltic pumps the coating times were between 1 and 24 h at a constant temperature of 35 c after which the coated particles were removed and washed and dried under ambient temperature 2 3 md simulation the force module and visualizer module of material studio software were applied and the assigned compass force field canonical ensemble nvt that is with a certain number of particles n volume v temperature t and force field were used to simulate the md of the system

c 17 30 å α β 90 and γ 120 13 the 10 4 plane was chosen in the simulation because it is the most stable surface of calcite and has the lowest surface energy the subsurface atoms of calcite are fixed and the surface atoms are fully relaxed the calculation step was 1 fs with a total calculation time of 500 ps and the statistical average was used to calculate the relevant parameters when the system reached equilibrium the binding energy ebin between the calcite surface and the phosphoric acid sodium dihydrogen phosphate molecule was calculated by the following formula 14 1 e b i n e t o t a l e

and flowed out from the bottom peristaltic pumps were used to deliver the raw water and the phosphorus solutions to the reactor at certain flow rates the concentrations of fluoride phosphate and calcium as well as the ph and the alkalinity of the effluent were determined at regular intervals 2 5 characterization the effluent water sample was filtered through 0 45 μm organic microporous filter

dissolution of calcite under hcl h3po4 and several phosphate salts is shown in fig 3 a corresponding kinetic fitting diagrams of ca2 dissolution are shown in fig s1 in the supporting information according to the amount of dissolved ca2 calcite had the strongest dissolution when exposed to the hcl solution followed by the h3po4 solution although the acid dissociation constants pka of hcl and h3po4 were 8 0 and 2 1 respectively the actual proton consumption of h3po4 was similar to that of hcl under the same molar concentration conditions the initial ph values of nah2po4 kh2po4 and a mixed system of nah2po4 and h3po4 in aqueous solution were 5 0 5 0 and 3 6 respectively i e all acidic although the mechanisms of the dissolution of calcite under acid neutral and alkaline conditions were different the dissolution of ca2 can be achieved in a wide ph range as reported in a previous study 15 monoacidic hcl and triacidic h3po4 have similar ability with respect to the dissolution of ca2 from calcite surfaces interestingly the concentration of ca2 dissolved from calcite exposed to nah2po4 was slightly higher than that from calcite exposed to kh2po4 according to the report by lu et al 16 the recrystallization of caco3 occurs when calcite is exposed to an aqueous solution the presence of na may inhibit this process with a negative effect on crystallization and thus enhance the continuous dissolution of ca2 our previous study suggested that a stable and continuous supply of ca2 is a critical factor in stable fluoride removal in the process of defluorination by induced crystallization using fap as seed crystals 17 in this study we found the ca2 supply requirement was met by the addition of moderate quantities of acid the final ph of both solution systems that included h3po4 was less than 7 0 as shown in fig 3b suggesting that a consistent and stable acid solution was maintained in both of them the dissolution of caco3 by acidic waters was controlled by the chemical reaction of h with the caco3 surface 18 which means h in water will react with the surface of caco3 until the solution becomes neutral however the final ph of both solution systems that included h3po4 was less than 7 0 we assumed that it is possible that there is an obstacle or factor that blocks the dissolution of ca2 from the surface of calcite the measured phosphate concentrations in the nah2po4 and kh2po4 systems were approximately 40 mg l while those of the h3po4 nah2po4 and h3po4 systems were 70 90 mg l fig 3c despite the fact that the concentrations of phosphate ions added to all systems were the same 1 5 mm or 145 5 mg l therefore it is suggested that some phosphate was adsorbed or in a precipitated state in the nah2po4 kh2po4 h3po4 nah2po4 and h3po4 systems considering that calcite particles have a relatively large surface area it is not surprising that the fresh calcium phosphate complex was not only dispersed in solution but was also adsorbed on the calcite surface furthermore these adsorbed fresh colloids maybe inhibit the etching of ca2 as a result there is an optimum ratio of ca and p for inducing crystallization defluoridation as we previously reported 7 8 3 2 md simulation the binding processes of h3po4 and nah2po4 on the 10 4 surface of calcite by md simulation are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively initially h3po4 molecules maintained a certain distance from the surface of calcite at 500 ps the molecules were close to the crystal surface of calcite indicating that there was a strong interaction between them this was also observed in the nah2po4 system the binding energies of h3po4 and nah2po4 with the calcite 104 plane are listed in table 1 it can be seen from the table that the binding energies ebin were all negative which means the binding between phosphate ions and the calcite surface was an exothermic process 13 the absolute value of the binding energy between h3po4 and the calcite surface was similar to that between nah2po4 and the calcite surface in fact h3po4 can dissolve a great amount of ca2 from the calcite lattice fig 3a which greatly weakens the binding between the h3po4 molecules and the calcite surface consequently this md result is not consistent with the analysis mentioned above chen et al found that the oxygen atoms of phosphate molecules were coordinated with the edge calcium atoms on the calcite surface while the hydrogen atoms of the phosphate molecules were coordinated with the lattice oxygen atoms on the calcite surface 19 suggesting that the ca o bond and ho bond were the optimal binding sites and that there was a strong electrostatic interaction between phosphate ions and the calcite crystal surface phosphate ions compete for the active sites on the crystal surface of calcite thus inhibiting the dissolution of ca2 from the surface this is why the amount of ca2 dissolved in the potassium and sodium phosphate systems was lower than that in the hcl system and even the amount of ca2 dissolved in the ternary acid h3po4 system did not exceed that in the hcl system fig 3 nevertheless the bonding of the phosphate ion and the calcite surface promoted the subsequent fap coating 3 3 morphology of the calcite facet under acidic conditions the surface morphological characteristics of the calcite exposed to hcl h3po4 and the phosphate buffer solutions were demonstrated by sem images fig 6 the pore property and surface areas of the calcite in different systems were characterized by the n2 adsorption desorption method see fig 7 and table 2 as shown in fig 6 the different surface morphologies of calcite under several solution conditions were obvious there were numerous cone tips on the surface of the calcite when it was exposed to the hcl solution and this sample also had the largest bet surface area table 2 compton s study showed that the dissolution morphology of the etch pits generated on calcite surfaces was a regular rhombus under 0 25 2 0 mm hcl solutions 15 this morphology was similar to that in our study except with a different cone tip density this could be due to different experiment conditions compton s study was done under flowing conditions while ours were done under static conditions the effect of kh2po4 was similar to that of h3po4 while the cone tip densities of both systems were significantly lower than that of the hcl system it can be seen from the eds results in fig 6 that a small amount of anions phosphate or chloride appeared in the crystal structure of the calcite surface in the h3po4 and hcl systems the impact of anionic additives such as phosphate and chloride upon the crystal morphology involves lattice matching where the anionic moieties replace lattice anions at the crystal surface thus facets grow more slowly and become more dominant in the resulting morphology 20 during the dissolution of calcite a flat polished miscut surface in calcite may break up into a nanoscale hill and valley structure in a near saturated solution and lower its total surface free energy in spite of having a large surface area thus surface energy driven recrystallization would occur modifying the surface morphology of calcite 21 tang et al showed that anion types and cu2 concentrations dramatically affect the dissolution morphology of calcite 22 however in our study the effect of anion was not obvious it can be inferred that cations have a greater influence on the dissolution of the calcite surface compared with the h3po4 system the nah2po4 system resulted in decreases in the cone tip density in their study offeddu et al also showed that the presence of na obviously reduced the cone tip density and changed the surface morphology of calcite 23 this can be attributed to the participation of na as discussed above na and ca2 have similar radii 0 095 nm and 0 099 nm respectively which enables the substitution of na for ca2 thus changing the morphology and size of the crystal on the calcite surface during the recrystallization of calcite the nascent calcite crystals exhibited a lower surface free energy than the raw calcite mineral which provided an induction potential for the growth of fap in the nah2po4 h3po4 mixed system the nascent calcite crystals on the calcite surface acted as seed crystals for fap formation and the continuity of calcite dissolution yielded a sufficient source ca2 as well as a suitable ph for the fap induced crystallization resulting in a stable fluoride removal process giannimaras and koutsoukos found that during the crystallization of calcite high amounts of inorganic phosphate ions adsorbed on calcite crystals occupying cationic sites 24 chen et al found through md simulations that the phosphonate molecules can energetically interact well with the crystal face of calcite on the stepped edge and the corner 19 therefore as compared with the raw calcite the surface of acid treated calcite had more active sites as nucleation sites which was more conducive to the subsequent crystallization and growth of fap 3 4 coating of fap on calcite the sem images and eds of calcite surfaces obtained under different coating times are shown in fig 8 the fap morphology on the calcite surface varied with the coating time when the coating time was extended from 1 h to 24 h the morphology of newly form fap evolved from amorphous to bayberry and then to rose petal shaped when the reaction time reached 6 h consistent with our previous study 7 the study conducted by zhu et al on the preparation of fap showed that sheet shaped fap could be formed after one week of aging 25 therefore it can be inferred that the difference in fap morphology under different coating times is due to the influence of aging time and 6 h may be a critical aging time the longer the coating time the stronger the pitting corrosion of the calcite surface fig 8 fap that formed on the surface of the calcite provided growth sites for induced crystallization defluorination and ca2 that continuously dissolved from the calcite surface provided a continuous calcium source for subsequent defluorination fig s2 shows that the percentage of surface coverage of fap coating on the calcite increased with the coating time the newly formed fap covered more than 73 of the calcite surface at a coating time of more than 4 h as the coating time increased to 24 h the calcite surface was completely covered by fap in order to achieve the induced crystallization of fluoride and calcium dissolution at the same time an appropriate coating proportion is required considering the crystalline morphology and coating proportion calcite with a coating time of 6 h was selected as the seed material for subsequent defluorination processes because high temperature can enhance the crystallinity of precipitation phases a portion of the material coated on calcite was collected and heated at 500 c for 3 h and then cooled to room temperature 26 fig 9 a shows that the main component in the material coated on the calcite and the heated sample as detected by xrd was fap suggesting that no amorphous calcium phosphate formed therefore the fluoride removal pathway of amorphous calcium phosphate formation and then of fluoride adsorption is blocked the xrd results of material with coating times of 1 24 h also showed that there were no other new phases formed except fap fig s3 the ftir results in fig 9b agree with our previous study 8 confirming that the main component in the material coated on the calcite was fap the xps results in fig 10 show that the newly formed material had f1s p2p and ca2p peaks at 684 5 133 2 and 347 2 ev respectively the main peak positions of fap 27 3 5 process control routine the fcc with a coating time of 6 h was used as the seed material the dosing molar ratio of p f was 3 1 no calcium was added to the reactor it can be seen from fig 11 that the fluoride ion concentration was reduced from 9 5 mg l to less than 1 5 mg l the corresponding fluoride removal rate range was 84 3 99 8 with increased time the ca2 concentration of the effluent gradually decreased corresponding to the decreasing dissolution of ca2 from the fcc it should be noted that the ca2 concentration in fig 11e is significantly higher than that in fig 3a this could be because the calcite dissolution experiment was done under static conditions while the fcc experiment was completed under flowing conditions the dissolution rate of the calcite was dependent on the flow rate i e at a slower flow rate the dissolution rate would decrease due to the back reaction being promoted through an increase in ca2 and hco3 and a decrease in h 15 the formation of fap shells on the surface of the calcite hindered the continuous dissolution of ca2 resulting in an increase in the effluent fluoride to nearly 1 5 mg l between bed volumes of 550 and 700 the regulated surface of the calcite during exposure to a phosphate system can provide active sites for induced crystallization however the continuity of calcite dissolution is inhibited by the excessive binding strength under fap formation as a result the continuous and stable supply of ca2 is inhibited and the fluoride removal efficiency decreases 4 conclusion ca2 is released from calcite in a phosphoric acid and phosphate solution the dissolution occurs predominantly at dislocations emerging on the crystal surface in the initial phase of calcite surface regulation coating treatment the introduction of na may promote the dissolution of ca2 from the calcite the results of md simulations show that phosphate has a strong binding effect on the calcite surface which may also promote subsequent fap coating moreover the nascent calcite crystals that formed on the calcite surface in the system show a lower surface free energy than the raw calcite mineral which provides an inducing effect for the growth of fap sem images indicate that rose petal shaped fap forms on the surface of the calcite with coating times of 6 24 h which provides growth sites for induced crystallization defluorination at the same time the dissolution of ca2 from the calcite surface provides a continuous ca2 supply source for subsequent defluorination fcc with a coating time 6 h was used as the seed crystal for subsequent column experiments the removal rate of fluoride ions in the fixed bed induced crystallization

13583,fluoride can be removed from potable water by induced crystallization of fluorapatite fap however the properties of the original crystal seed using calcite as a continuous source of ca2 are not well defined this paper describes the effect of calcite surface regulation by phosphate groups on the form of fap that serves as the original crystal seed for the induced crystallization defluoridation the results show that when dissociated from phosphate groups h promotes ca2 dissolution from the surface of calcite although the kinetics of calcium dissolution by phosphate acid and phosphate salt are different the results of molecular dynamic md simulations show that phosphate has a strong binding effect on the surface of calcite which suits the subsequent fap coating the sodium ions na supplied by sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 inhibit the recrystallization of calcium carbonate caco3 and promote the continuous release of ca2 from calcite the ca2 ions then promote the nucleation and growth of fap on the surface of the calcite scanning electron microscope sem images indicate that rose petal shaped fap forms on the surface of calcite with a coating time of 6 24 h which provides growth sites for induced crystallization defluorination the fluorapatite coated calcite fcc with a coating time of 6 h and an fap coverage of the calcite surface of 82 86 was selected as the seed crystal the fixed bed induced crystallization reactor was run for 700 bed volumes bv with this seed crystal and successfully removed 84 3 99 8 of the fluoride keywords fluoride removal fluorapatite coated calcite seed crystal calcium source induced crystallization 1 introduction fluorine is one of the most essential trace elements for the human body and is indispensable for growth and metabolism however excessive ingestion of fluoride can cause health problems such as dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis 1 fluorosis primarily caused by long term excessive intake of fluoride from drinking water has become a major threat to human health in many countries including china india pakistan turkey iraq afghanistan mexico and thailand 1 3 the guideline values for fluoride suggested by the world health organization who and china are 1 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l respectively 4 therefore treating groundwater with a high fluoride content and reducing the fluoride concentration to a level suitable for human drinking and health is of paramount importance there are many treatment methods for fluoride removal including adsorption ion exchangers precipitation membrane electrocoagulation and electro dialysis 5 among these adsorption and precipitation are commonly adopted because of their high defluoridation capacities of late induced crystallization a technique based on the precipitation of fluorapatite fap ca5 po4 3f using a seed crystal i e phosphate rock pr has received attention and is considered an efficient and environmentally friendly method for removing fluoride from drinking water the singular advantages of this technology are that the seed crystal pr can be used repeatedly for defluoridation by induced crystallization and the spent pr can be recycled in the phosphorus fertilizer industry as a stable phosphate resource 6 7 natural pr contains both fap and calcite which makes it a perfect seed crystal option for fluoride removal fluidized bed crystallization technology with natural pr as a seed crystal can achieve a constant fluoride effluent of 0 4 0 9 mg l 8 unfortunately phosphorus is a non renewable resource and it is estimated that global rock phosphate reserves about 70 million tonnes worldwide reported in 2018 could be depleted in 50 years 9 11 thus it is necessary to seek an alternative crystal seed material for defluoridation to replace natural pr given that the induced crystallization process mainly occurs on the surface of apatite the main component of pr it seems feasible to establish an interface microenvironment to reduce the consumption of fap and overcome the defect that the enclosed p inside the pr particles cannot be effectively utilized our previous investigation into fluoride removal by induced crystallization using fap calcite as seed crystals showed that neither fap nor calcite individually yielded a satisfactory fluoride removal rate but using fap coupled with calcite showed a high removal rate of 94 7 7 kanno et al showed that calcite could provide ideal catalytic activity because of the strong interaction of phosphate po4 3 with calcite surfaces in hydrogen chloride hcl and sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 solutions calcite is also a readily available relatively inexpensive source of calcium ions ca2 for hydroxyapatite synthesis in the presence of externally added po4 3 12 therefore fluorapatite coated calcite fcc which can be generated by coating granular calcite with reactive micrometer sized fap may be a feasible strategy to achieve defluoridation by fluorapatite induced crystallization in this study we investigated the mechanism of calcite surface regulation by different phosphate species and evaluated the defluoridation efficiency with induced crystallization we studied the influence of the phosphate group state the cover ratio of fap on calcite and the coating time on the synthesis of fcc molecular dynamics md simulation was used to calculate the interaction energy between phosphate and the calcite surface scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectronic spectroscopy xps were employed to characterize the raw calcite and fcc the surface regulation mechanism of calcite for defluoridation by fap induced crystallization was demonstrated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw calcite with a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm used in this research was obtained from hezhou guangxi province the characteristics of the calcite are shown in fig 1 this raw material was composed of calcite with a small amount of calcium oxide the calcite particles were rinsed with deionized water di water followed by drying at 110 c for 12 h all the reagents used were produced by tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china reagents were analytical reagent grade used without further purification with the exception of sodium fluoride naf which was guaranteed reagent grade naf and sodium chloride nacl were dissolved in di water to prepare a 0 5 mm fluoride solution with 0 01 m nacl as a background electrolyte the dissolution of ca2 from calcite was investigated using solutions containing 1 5 mm hcl sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate nah2po4 2h2o potassium dihydrate phosphate kh2po4 and hydrogen phosphate h3po4 and one nah2po4 h3po4 mixed solution contained 1 2 mm nah2po4 2h2o and 0 3 mm h3po4 2 2 synthesis of fcc the reaction device shown in fig 2 was constructed of plexiglass with an effective height of 1 0 m and an inner diameter of 5 0 cm the raw calcite particles were placed in the reactor to a height of 30 cm fluoride containing raw water and the desired concentration of the nah2po4 solution were pumped to the top of the reactor at certain flow rates i e raw water 6 0 l h by peristaltic pumps the coating times were between 1 and 24 h at a constant temperature of 35 c after which the coated particles were removed and washed and dried under ambient temperature 2 3 md simulation the force module and visualizer module of material studio software were applied and the assigned compass force field canonical ensemble nvt that is with a certain number of particles n volume v temperature t and force field were used to simulate the md of the system composed of calcite and phosphoric acid molecules or disodium hydrogen phosphate molecules calcite crystallizes in a trigonal system with r3c symmetry and the main unit cell parameters are a b 5 05 å c 17 30 å α β 90 and γ 120 13 the 10 4 plane was chosen in the simulation because it is the most stable surface of calcite and has the lowest surface energy the subsurface atoms of calcite are fixed and the surface atoms are fully relaxed the calculation step was 1 fs with a total calculation time of 500 ps and the statistical average was used to calculate the relevant parameters when the system reached equilibrium the binding energy ebin between the calcite surface and the phosphoric acid sodium dihydrogen phosphate molecule was calculated by the following formula 14 1 e b i n e t o t a l e

water molecule 2 4 fluoride removal experiments the synthesized fcc particles were placed in the fixed bed to a height of 30 cm the fluoride containing raw water was fed into the reactor from the top and flowed out from the bottom peristaltic pumps were used to deliver the raw water and the phosphorus solutions to the reactor at certain flow rates the concentrations of fluoride phosphate and calcium as well as the ph and the alkalinity of the effluent were determined at regular intervals 2 5 characterization the effluent water sample was filtered through 0 45 μm organic microporous filter membranes and then the concentration of ca2 was measured by the flame atomic absorption method icp 1100 thermo usa the fluoride concentration in the effluent water was measured using an ion selective

dissolution of calcite under hcl h3po4 and several phosphate salts is shown in fig 3 a corresponding kinetic fitting diagrams of ca2 dissolution are shown in fig s1 in the supporting information according to the amount of dissolved ca2 calcite had the strongest dissolution when exposed to the hcl solution followed by the h3po4 solution although the acid dissociation constants pka of hcl and h3po4 were 8 0 and 2 1 respectively the actual proton consumption of h3po4 was similar to that of hcl under the same molar concentration conditions the initial ph values of nah2po4 kh2po4 and a mixed system of nah2po4 and h3po4 in aqueous solution were 5 0 5 0 and 3 6 respectively i e all acidic although the mechanisms of the dissolution of calcite under acid neutral and alkaline conditions were different the dissolution of ca2 can be achieved in a wide ph range as reported in a previous study 15 monoacidic hcl and triacidic h3po4 have similar ability with respect to the dissolution of ca2 from calcite surfaces interestingly the concentration of ca2 dissolved from calcite exposed to nah2po4 was slightly higher than that from calcite exposed to kh2po4 according to the report by lu et al 16 the recrystallization of caco3 occurs when calcite is exposed to an aqueous solution the presence of na may inhibit this process with a negative effect on crystallization and thus enhance the continuous dissolution of ca2 our previous study suggested that a stable and continuous supply of ca2 is a critical factor in stable fluoride removal in the process of defluorination by induced crystallization using fap as seed crystals 17 in this study we found the ca2 supply requirement was met by the addition of moderate quantities of acid the final ph of both solution systems that included h3po4 was less than 7 0 as shown in fig 3b suggesting that a consistent and stable acid solution was maintained in both of them the dissolution of caco3 by acidic waters was controlled by the chemical reaction of h with the caco3 surface 18 which means h in water will react with the surface of caco3 until the solution becomes neutral however the final ph of both solution systems that included h3po4 was less than 7 0 we assumed that it is possible that there is an obstacle or factor that blocks the dissolution of ca2 from the surface of calcite the measured phosphate concentrations in the nah2po4 and kh2po4 systems were approximately 40 mg l while those of the h3po4 nah2po4 and h3po4 systems were 70 90 mg l fig 3c despite the fact that the concentrations of phosphate ions added to all systems were the same 1 5 mm or 145 5 mg l therefore it is suggested that some phosphate was adsorbed or in a precipitated state in the nah2po4 kh2po4 h3po4 nah2po4 and h3po4 systems considering that calcite particles have a relatively large surface area it is not surprising that the fresh calcium phosphate complex was not only dispersed in solution but was also adsorbed on the calcite surface furthermore these adsorbed fresh colloids maybe inhibit the etching of ca2 as a result there is an optimum ratio of ca and p for inducing crystallization defluoridation as we previously reported 7 8 3 2 md simulation the binding processes of h3po4 and nah2po4 on the 10 4 surface of calcite by md simulation are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively initially h3po4 molecules maintained a certain distance from the surface of calcite at 500 ps the molecules were close to the crystal surface of calcite indicating that there was a strong interaction between them this was also observed in the nah2po4 system the binding energies of h3po4 and nah2po4 with the calcite 104 plane are listed in table 1 it can be seen from the table that the binding energies ebin were all negative which means the binding between phosphate ions and the calcite surface was an exothermic process 13 the absolute value of the binding energy between h3po4 and the calcite surface was similar to that between nah2po4 and the calcite surface in fact h3po4 can dissolve a great amount of ca2 from the calcite lattice fig 3a which greatly weakens the binding between the h3po4 molecules and the calcite surface consequently this md result is not consistent with the analysis mentioned above chen et al found that the oxygen atoms of phosphate molecules were coordinated with the edge calcium atoms on the calcite surface while the hydrogen atoms of the phosphate molecules were coordinated with the lattice oxygen atoms on the calcite surface 19 suggesting that the ca o bond and ho bond were the optimal binding sites and that there was a strong electrostatic interaction between phosphate ions and the calcite crystal surface phosphate ions compete for the active sites on the crystal surface of calcite thus inhibiting the dissolution of ca2 from the surface this is why the amount of ca2 dissolved in the potassium and sodium phosphate systems was lower than that in the hcl system and even the amount of ca2 dissolved in the ternary acid h3po4 system did not exceed that in the hcl system fig 3 nevertheless the bonding of the phosphate ion and the calcite surface promoted the subsequent fap coating 3 3 morphology of the calcite facet under acidic conditions the surface morphological characteristics of the calcite exposed to hcl h3po4 and the phosphate buffer solutions were demonstrated by sem images fig 6 the pore property and surface areas of the calcite in different systems were characterized by the n2 adsorption desorption method see fig 7 and table 2 as shown in fig 6 the different surface morphologies of calcite under several solution conditions were obvious there were numerous cone tips on the surface of the calcite when it was exposed to the hcl solution and this sample also had the largest bet surface area table 2 compton s study showed that the dissolution morphology of the etch pits generated on calcite surfaces was a regular rhombus under 0 25 2 0 mm hcl

dosing molar ratio of p f was 3 1 no calcium was added to the reactor it can be seen from fig 11 that the fluoride ion concentration was reduced from 9 5 mg l to less than 1 5 mg l the corresponding fluoride removal rate range was 84 3 99 8 with increased time the ca2 concentration of the effluent gradually decreased corresponding to the decreasing dissolution of ca2 from the fcc it should be

transformation in the early 1970s 1 the textile industry is a significant contributor to malaysia s economy and is regarded as the backbone of one of the active developing industries in the country one of the best known traditional textile industries in malaysia including the southeast asia region indonesia thailand is the batik industry 2 4 batik production is expanding and has been commercialised and the industry contributes to positive economic growth in malaysia 3 more than 1 000 batik factories are located mainly throughout kelantan and terengganu on the east coast of malaysia where the industry becomes a significant source of occupation and income generation for the local people nevertheless behind the positive successful and growing progress of textile industries in malaysia it also acts as a double edged sword the ruinous is that the development of textile industries leaves a large footprint to the environment the significant pollution sources are due to the discharge of a large volume of water 500 l per day depending on size of textile produced containing synthetic waste dyes colour residues catalytic chemicals wax sodium silicate as fixing agents excess

health therefore the design of a textile effluent treatment plant should consider different organic pollutants as the pollution profile in each step may vary as recommended by several researchers and industrial players the ideal effluent treatment process should include an initial step of chemical treatment followed by biological treatment to remove organic matter 5 physical treatment should be implemented as the finishing step for the treatment plant e g adsorption membrane separation or other oxidation treatment processes using the method that can offer the lowest cost for a complete treatment the costs may include both capital expenditure capex and operational expenditure opex such as unit operation machine energy usage intensive labour maintenance disposal cost for high sludge generation and other expenses although the investment for wastewater treatment cannot be avoided in order to comply with the environmental regulatory discharge limits there are still rooms to minimise the costs as a reference the process flow diagram in figure s1 is one of the typical schematic designs of textile industries in malaysia that practice treatment systems in their production plants 5 chemical biological and physical methods are conventional treatment methods in an integrated wastewater treatment plant chemical treatment often demand a huge budget allocation due to a large amount of chemicals used even though they are excellent in decolourising wastewater besides the accumulation of concentrated sludge after coagulation and flocculation is a drawback of this conventional treatment biological treatment requires a large aerobic tank area due to long hydraulic retention time as the bacteria have a slow growth rate furthermore more sludge is produced in this step this method indirectly causes secondary pollution and creates a disposal problem at the polishing step the textile effluent is treated in an activated carbon column filter before the treated wastewater is discharged into water bodies thus among the treatment methods available physical chemical and biological physical treatment is the most effective approach as the finishing step in an effluent treatment plant the finishing step is essential and recommended as the treatment produces high quality treated effluent with free minimal contaminants and decolours the discharged water membrane filtration ion exchange and adsorption are among the most extensively used physical treatment methods 9 the limitations of membrane filtration include a short lifetime of a membrane before fouling occurs high working pressure and a costly membrane system 9 besides ion exchange is ineffective in removing several types of dyes e g reactive dyes the main drawback in adsorption is the adsorbent itself in terms of sludge disposal and regeneration factor 10 therefore by comparing these techniques the method with minimum limitations has been considered i e adsorption and further investigated according to the documented studies adsorption has been proven efficient in eliminating pollutants only if the adsorbent has a high removal rate adsorption capacity and sustainability 11 12 therefore this study aims to evaluate an alternative way of treating batik industrial effluent using a novel approach of zwitterionic adsorbent coating zwitad modifies the conventional adsorption concept powder pallet granule form of adsorbent which then transformed into a coating layer using a more straightforward synthesis procedure and flexible application the treatment is designed as a simple method to produce an acceptable effluent before discharging into water bodies instead of using activated carbon column which is more costing and complex the treated batik industrial effluent must comply with standard b of the regulations stipulated by the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 from the department of environment doe malaysia moreover in developing a batik industrial treatment system the economic aspect should be considered as most of the batik manufacturers built a small scale workshop factory and cannot afford expensive and complicated treatment this new innovative solution aims to simultaneously increase dye removal performance and reduce the energetic footprint by minimising operating costs and secondary waste generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 batik effluent samples the effluent samples were provided by a local batik manufacturer ipoh malaysia sampling bottles were rinsed with the samples prior to sample collection the samples were manually collected in a 30 l plastic container and preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c in accordance with the standard method the batik effluent was collected from four main discharged points as shown in fig 1 at i ii iii and iv in batik processing i e soaking boiling and two rinsing steps the samples were dark bluish with a high content of organic compounds the physicochemical characteristics of the wastewater were studied in terms of ph value cod and colour american dye manufacturers institute admi unit the scale used to measure the colour removal of wastewater as an indicator of water quality the main characteristics of the wastewater are presented in table 1 discussion section the batik wastewater exceeded the limit stated in the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 for a specific trade of the textile industry in malaysia therefore the direct discharge of batik effluent from this industry into water bodies is prohibited and the effluent needs to be treated accordingly the physicochemical parameters such as cod ph and colour were analysed based on the standard methods for examining batik effluent before and after the treatment the method for determination of cod in wastewater samples using cod digestion reagent vial 20 1500 mg l cod hr tests was based on the addition of 2 ml of batik sample to the vial which was heated in dbr200 reactor for 2 h at 150 c after cooling for 2 h the vial was inserted into the dr 6000 spectrophotometer model hach usa and the cod reading was measured the colour measurement was followed a standard method 2120 f using 1 inch sample cell and it was filled in with 10 ml of batik wastewater the admi of sample was determined using spectrophotometer 2 2 reagent and materials bentonite is a type of mineral clay were manufactured by sigma aldrich and used as received without further modification poly epichlorohydrin dimethyleamine epi dma used as cationic polyelectrolyte 50 wt in h2o and acrylic polymer emulsion ape as a binder were bought from nha scientific resource cyberjaya malaysia all reagent used were analytical grade and distilled water was used to prepare the sample coating dilution and solution preparation cotton thread cloth was purchased from local textile retailer parit buntar malaysia the solution ph was adjusted using analytical grade hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh solution both from r m chemical pdn malaysia 2 3 preparation of zwitad adsorbent coating a complete preparation method of zwitad on a small scale can be referred to previous studies 13 14 briefly zwitad is an adsorbent coating in a flat sheet layer compounded with a binder from acrylic polymer emulsion ape base bentonite as an additive distilled water as a carrier and epichlorohydrin dimethyl amine epidma as a surfactant in this study these components were mixed based on the formulated ratio and up scaled by 50 times the solution was stirred using a homogeniser ultra turrax t50 ika at 2 000 rpm for complete dissolution the zwitad solution was then transferred into a stainless steel container in a coating rig system for the coating process fig 2 the coating rig was designed based on an automation system to coat paint the zwitad solution onto the cotton cloth as a substrate support for large scale production representing the industrial application once the controller button was pushed and adjusted to 60 rpm the raw cotton cloth was automatically moved and immersed in the coating solution the sample was kept moving until one batch 1 m of the coated cotton was in the drying oven at this point the rig stopped for 10 min to allow the sample to dry completely in the oven with the temperature set at 80 c the coating process continued for the next batch until there was no more zwitad solution in the container the dried coated adsorbent was then rinsed using tap water to remove the residue uncoated coating or dust the samples were dried again in the oven at 80 c overnight and the final product named the zwitad strip is ready for treatment 2 4 batch adsorption experiment for adsorption experiment the batik effluent from releasing point ii after boiling the fabric with soda ash and point iii rinsed fabric with raw water was mixed at a ratio of 1 9 the mixed batik effluent was used for further analysis for the adsorbent the zwitad strip was cut to the dimensions of 20 cm 5 cm the amount of solid dried adsorbent coated onto the cotton cloth was 0 3 0 5 g which is equivalent to 1 strip 20cm 5cm as the zwitad is in a flat sheet form the strip was placed in the interior part of a 250 ml glass beaker the mixed batik effluent 200 ml was added into the glass beaker and gently stirred with a magnetic bar 350 rpm using a stirrer multi hotplate stirrer model wisd adsorption was performed at its original ph each experiment was repeated three times for reproducibility and accuracy the batik effluent was analysed using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer by monitoring the absorbance changes at the wavelength of maximum absorbance λmax the colour removal efficiency was obtained using eq 1 1 c o l o u r r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y a b s 0 a b s a b s o 100 where abs0 mg l is the initial absorbance value of batik effluent and abs mg l is the batik effluent concentration at time t min 2 5 reusability study the reusability study of zwitad was undertake chemical regeneration using 1 m of sodium hydroxide naoh solution the adsorbed zwitad was rinsed slightly with distilled water to clean the surface before undergo next cycle of adsorption after that the adsorption was performed similar as batch experiment in section 2 3 2 6 sample and adsorbent coating analysis the reduction in the colour intensity of batik effluent was analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu corporation kyoto japan the cod of batik effluent was measured using the reactor digestion method and analysed by hach dr 6000 hach usa the morphology of the zwitad strip was assessed using a scanning electron microscope crest system m sdn bhd quanta feg 450 with 100 and 2 500 magnification using an accelerating voltage of 20 kv an elemental composition analysis from energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was used to identify the elements inside zwitad a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscope ftir nicolet is10 was employed to detect the changes in the functional group of the amphoteric adsorbent surface before and after adsorption in the 4 000 400 cm 1 wavelength region and 4 cm 1 of spectral resolution the photographic images were captured for visual observation the isoelectric point of adsorbent coating used for the adsorption experiment was determined by using solid to liquid ratio of 1 1000 in the present study the samples strip with 0 2 g mass was added to 200 ml of distilled water with varying ph 2 12 and stirred for 24 h the δph ph final ph initial of the solution was plotted against initial ph of the solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis results and performance studied of batik wastewater the major consecutive steps involved in batik production and the generated waste are presented in the schematic diagram shown in fig 2 the process starts with hand drawing followed by drying at atmospheric temperature the fabric is moved to a silicate container and immersed for less than 30 min to fix the colour on the fabric the procedure is continued by rinsing the fabric using raw water to soften the fabric at this point the wastewater is first generated with a high concentration of silicate residues at point ii wastewater is generated from a boiling pan where the fabric is boiled with soda ash this step is one of the important procedures in removing wax painted on the fabric at the beginning of the process the effluent contains a high concentration of silicate and wax the fabric is again rinsed with raw water twice to remove excess wax point iii and subsequently the fabric is scented where the effluent is generated at point iv the procedure ends with the drying of the fabric at ambient temperature the batik manufacturing stages are almost identical among operators especially in painting boiling and rinsing of the fabric 15 19 therefore the effluent samples in this study were collected at points ii and iii the effluent at point ii was chosen due to the high concentration of colour and the rinsing water at point iii was used as a dilution solution for point ii effluent without make used of other sources of clean raw water both effluent was mixed with a 1 9 ratio prior to adsorption using zwitad strip the volume of raw water used to rinse the fabric iii is about 9 10 times higher than effluent in sample ii therefore it was estimated that the 1 9 is an appropriate ratio to dilute the wastewater sample the uv vis absorption spectra of mixed batik wastewater showed an absorption peak at 437 nm as shown in fig 3 the peak appeared in a visible region 437 nm indicating the existence of chromophores responsible for imparting colour to the batik effluent 18 the values of cod concentration ph and colour for each sample before the treatment are shown in table 1 the effluent of each step has different contents of cod colour and ph with significantly high values for all the parameters involved the cod values are 2 205 and 412 mg l at the releasing points ii and iii respectively and the mixed point recorded the cod value of 496 mg l as compared to another batik manufacturer the cod values were differs according to the volume and types of synthetic dyes used in textiles colouring the cod were ranging from 30 13 600 ppm starting from soaking boiling to rinsing steps as well as their ph 11 13 8 a higher admi value 16 900 at releasing point ii is due to the release of un coated dye from the fabric during boiling process the mixed points ii and iii recorded the value of 9 800 admi thus a thoroughgoing treatment is still required before discharging each sample was compared to standard b of the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 after the first treatment using a single strip of zwitad the cod concentration reduced to approximately 67 9 and complied with the allowable discharge limit 159 mg l however for the first stage of adsorption the colour was not effectively removed as the remaining colour had 250 admi the second stage of adsorption was carried out to obtain a value below the allowable discharge limit especially for colour reduction in the second treatment the cod concentration admi and ph passed the standard limit where the values were reduced to 147 mg l of cod 128 admi and ph 7 34 table 2 the images of zwitad strips were taken before and after adsorption the original zwitad strips were white but turned greenish after the batik effluent adsorbed onto the strips fig 4 a the dye pigments from batik wastewater were evenly distributed onto the zwitad surface and imparted the greenish colour the image of mixed batik effluent at points ii and iii is exhibited in fig 4 b producing a clear solution after the treatment the decolourisation of batik effluent was analysed using the uv vis spectra as shown in fig 5 the reduction in the adsorption peak λmax at 437 nm was observed for every 1 h adsorption interval initially the absorbance value was 0 954 and decreased to 0 474 0 291 0 204 0 142 0 104 and 0 082 each hour for 6 h of contact time fig 6 shows the cod concentration according to the respective ph series and their percentage removal after the zwitad treatment before adjusting the ph the mixed batik effluent from points ii and iii was originally at ph 10 9 as can be seen the percentage removal decreased from 65 to 21 as the ph increased from 3 to 9 and increased significantly to 69 1 toward ph 11 the cod concentration showed the highest reduction at ph 5 134 mg l followed by ph 11 157 mg l the lowest reduction was observed at ph 9 with 229 mg l the isoelectric point of zwitad is 8 2 fig 7 at this ph the difference between the initial and the final h or oh is zero this is the point at which they exhibited amphoteric characteristic of the materials 20 the zwitad surface is positively charged when the ph of the solution is 8 2 which favours the anionic species of dyes while at higher ph 8 2 the negatively charged adsorbent surface favours cationic species therefore from the results obtained the zwitad could function in both acidic ph 3 and alkaline ph 11 conditions probably because the dye content in batik effluent consists of cationic and anionic species the amphoteric functionality of zwitad is proven by its ability to remove batik dyes at various ph values thus the findings suggest that zwitad could reduce the cod concentration at any ph from acidic to alkaline condition this feature is advantageous for zwitad as the condition of wastewater effluent differs from one industry to another furthermore the cod values are below 250 mg l for each ph studied and complied with standard b of the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 for the textile industry the result is consistent with earlier literature of yabo et al 2016 where the dye pollutants cationic and anionic were fairly stable in a relatively wide ph range of 4 8 21 similar findings were also observed in other studies 22 23 fig 8 exhibits the performance of zwitad for mixing and static conditions in batik effluent treatment a significant difference could be seen for both conditions in the presence of mixing effect the adsorption contact time was sped up and the percentage removal was higher than the static condition within 1 h of adsorption the mixing mode achieved 50 removal compared to only 6 in the static mode in 24 h the zwitad recorded 91 4 and 83 removal for mixing and static conditions respectively nevertheless even in a static condition and longer contact time zwitad could still functioned well to adsorb the pollutants in the solution this attribute can be as an added advantage if the effluent is placed in a simpler container or storage tank without a mixing facility to treat wastewater mixing effect is vital in adsorption in the presence of agitation the kinetic of dye molecules enables the bulk liquid to be adsorbed to the adsorbent boundary layer due to enhanced turbulence in the solution thus confirming that the external diffusion played a significant role on the adsorption kinetic of the solution 24 previous studied proved that the rate of removal increased with the increased in agitation rate 25 3 2 characterizations of zwitad scanning electron microscopy sem was performed to investigate the surface morphology of zwitad with low and high magnification of 100 fig 9 a and 2 500 fig 9b respectively the dried adsorbent coated onto a weaving linkage pattern with loosely spiral cellulose fibre of cotton cloth can be observed clearly from the images at 2 500 magnification the single thread is visibly coated with the adsorbent and covered the cotton cloth fig 9c strong coating between the adsorbent and substrate is an important factor to prevent leaching and peeling off of the material in addition zwitad strip is a non porous materials seem there have no obvious pore exhibited from the sem image it can be inferred from bet surface area and porosity result as shown in table 3 however with this non porous structure zwitad still can contribute to positive adsorption performance through other types of interaction mechanism further discussion in surface area section after adsorption process the morphology of zwitad showed no noticeable changes compared to the morphology before treatment fig 9 similar finding were observed from other coating studied that used cotton fabric as adsorbent support or substrate their characterization through sem capture was clearly observed that the spherical particles of adsorbent were closely attached to a cotton fiber and demonstrate that the coating was not peeled off from the cotton fiber by ultrasound 14 26 29 the elemental chemical composition of zwitad was analysed using edx spectroscopy the graph presents the detected elements in the pristine zwitad strip and zwitad after batik effluent adsorption fig 10 a and b strong bands of metal elements such as silicon si aluminium al titanium ti calcium ca and magnesium mg could be observed in each graph this finding establishes the existence of ape and bentonite in zwitad and indicates proper blending of adsorbent coating additionally non metal elements chlorine carbon and oxygen were also detected in the graphs besides the presence of chlorine cl element is from the epidma surfactant as can be referred from its molecular structure 30 however cl was eliminated after adsorption this might be due to the adsorption of pollutants onto the zwitad strip and the dyes have recovered the surfaces from the batik effluent eventually cl could not be traced while edx analysis was performed 14 31 3 3 ftir analysis of zwitad the infrared spectra of the functional groups and structural components of the samples were investigated using ftir spectroscopy the prepared pristine zwitad and zwitad after treatment were compared and presented in fig 11 a strong and sharp absorption band at 1 000 1 050 cm 1 is due to the si o si stretching vibration for both samples before and after adsorption with different peak intensities 8 32 there are also several peaks between 750 and 950 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching bands of fe oh mg oh and al oh derived from layered aluminosilicate of bentonite and several components in ape binder 33 broad and medium intensity bending vibrations are present between 1 420 and 1 480 cm 1 suggesting the intercalation of epidma inside the bentonite interlayer 34 the absorption band at 1700 cm 1 indicates the co stretching of carbonyl carboxyl and acetyl groups this band appeared at the line spectrum of zwitad before the treatment and the peak has higher intensity after batik effluent adsorption extra peaks that appeared at 2 900 3 100 cm 1 are attributed to the vibration of nh stretching from the amine group and asymmetric and symmetric stretch of hch which might originate from the dyes used in batik production adsorbed onto the zwitad strip in general after the adsorption of batik effluent onto adsorbent coating the spectrum of the zwitad showing reduction in their band intensity where the functional groups either shifted in frequency or disappeared in some cases these spectral changes specify the possible association or connection of various functional groups from zwitad surface during the adsorption process the similar trend of shifting or disappearing of bonding can be found in previous studies 35 36 the surface area of adsorbent is one of the important factors affecting its adsorption behaviour and performance in the present study the surface properties of zwitad were analysed based on the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm using brunauer emmett teller bet method and their corresponding properties are summarised in table 3 the bet surface area total pore volume and external surface area of zwitad are 2 7482 m2 g 0 0018 cm3 g and 4 6439 m2 g respectively the average pore size of zwitad recorded diameter of 26 0318 nm corresponding to a mesoporous adsorbent a material with a porous structure would significantly increase the effective surface area and available active sites contributing to positive adsorption performance 37 referring to the classification of iupac pore dimensions adsorbent pores are classified into micropore with a diameter less than 2 nm mesopore with a diameter between 2 and 50 nm and macropore with a diameter more than 50 nm 38 the surface area of zwitad is comparable with other adsorbents prepared by previous researchers 39 the surface areas of chitosan and modified chitosan are 0 29 and 1 32 m2 g respectively the porosity of the zwitad strip 20 cm 5 cm was calculated yielding the porosity of 2 614 therefore it can be inferred that although the surface area average pore size and porosity give relatively minimum results these properties are still useful for zwitad as an adsorbent to adsorb pollutants coupled with the charged interaction or existing surface bonding 3 4 adsorption mechanism of zwitad adsorption is a surface occurrence where an adsorbent entraps dye molecules through either or both physical and chemical interactions this process depends strongly on the types of adsorbate auxochrome or chromophore and surface chemistry of adsorbents particle size surface area temperature ph contact time 40 in addition multiple adsorption interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate would also involve electrostatic interaction 34 41 chemical surface complexation 42 43 chemisorption 44 45 pore filling 46 47 ion exchange diffusion 48 49 hydrogen bonding interaction 11 50 lewis acid lewis base interaction 43 51 van der waals forces 52 53 hydrophobic reaction 54 55 and π π stacking interaction 41 56 57 the possible surface interaction between the zwitad strip and pollutants from batik effluent can be ascribed to electrostatic attraction surface area chemical bonding and other developed bonds such as hydrogen bonding fig 12 the batik effluent which is a mixture of various dyes will interact with the functional groups on the surfaces of zwitad the protonated amine nh3 which is basically from cationic dyes and the sulfonyl groups so3 from anionic dyes would be the main charges in the effluent solution adsorption occurs by electrostatic interaction once the positively charged dyes are attracted to the negatively charged groups of zwitad si oˉ ca oˉ ti oˉ and al oˉ these functional groups are originally from bentonite clay and ape with the major components of alumina silica calcium and titanium refer to the edx results similar interaction can be found from other studied through negatively charged dye anions r so3 and the positively charged adsorbent sites nh3 from functionalized montmorillonite 50 58 the zwitterionic surface charge of the zwitad initiate the electrostatic interactions and play a primary role in the adsorption mechanism of ionic batik waste together with the other interactions that are responsible for the adsorption besides a number of hydroxyl groups oh from the zwitad surface create an interaction between the nh3 groups of dyes eventually creating strong hydrogen bonding besides the positive ions at the zwitad surface are from the intercalation of epidma molecules onto bentonite and ape besides since the surface area of zwitad is low it outcome is insignificant on the adsorption mechanism regardless of a low surface area value the zwitad adsorption capacity still high 59 another important factor that also plays a vital role in adsorption is the ph of the dye solution the charges of solution can alter the surface charge of the adsorbent consequently affecting the dye sorption efficiency the degree of ionisation would also affect the solubility of dyes and the dissociation of surface functional groups on the active sites of the adsorbent in an acidic medium the adsorbent surface is protonated due to the availability of a large number of h ions which attract available anions from the medium if the effluent exists as an anionic dye it contains mostly the sulfonated group so3na charged in an aqueous medium therefore electrostatic attraction will occur between the protonated zwitad surface and anionic dye hence higher removal of anionic dye could be observed in an acidic medium meanwhile the removal efficiency of anionic dye will decrease when the ph of the anionic solution is in the alkaline range this is due to the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic dye and deprotonated adsorbent surface in addition the availability of oh ions in an alkaline medium also competes with the anionic dye resulting in lower removal efficiency of anionic dyes the other observation based on adsorption mechanism can be referred in few related studied 60 62 3 5 proposed application of zwitad at an industrial level at an industrial level the application of zwitad is proposed in a simple yet practical operation normally an activated carbon column facility is installed at the finishing part of a certain wastewater treatment plant to further polish the treated effluent and decolourised the discharged water positive performance is offered with this advanced and sophisticated treatment but there are still drawbacks in the process an activated carbon column requires higher equipment and facility costs as it is the most energy intensive process to operate the system pressurised pumps electricity the costs also cover the installation of the column costly adsorbent production piping system arrangement and complex maintenance procedures such as cleaning and replacement of the equipment and adsorbent therefore a simple approach of treatment for the finishing step is proposed by replacing the activated carbon column with a functional industrial storage tank fig 13 it is suggested that zwitad is laminated or slotted in the interior part of the storage tank and while in operation the rotator is turned on for better adsorption performance the storage tank can be designed as a batch or continuous system with feasible operation 3 6 specification of batik effluent based on environmental quality regulations additional analyses including bod 5 day test suspended solids oil and grease and heavy metal detection were also conducted table 4 these analyses aimed to identify the percentage reduction and compare the concentration of each element with the standard specification from the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 the bod 5 fluoride and oil and grease in batik effluent exceeded the standard specification and required treatment before discharging after the treatment with zwitad significant changes could be observed in the concentration reduction especially for oil and grease 99 1 followed by fluoride 88 23 and bod 5 50 7 other detected elements were manganese and zinc with very minimum concentrations of 0 04 and 0 2 mg l respectively the suspended solids could be reduced by approximately 78 72 after the treatment therefore by considering these promising results zwitad proved its capability in adsorbing various pollutants as compared to other study different batik manufacturer will produce different chemical properties of batik effluents payam et al 2016 evaluated and treated the real batik wastewater through sequential process of acidification magnesium oxide and palm shell based activated carbon the detected heavy metals were pb fe cu zn al mg ca cr and si while there was no mn detected in the sample of wastewater after undergone those three treatment the cod concentration was reduced to 50 mg l and the concentration of heavy metals decrease below the standard a or b 8 in another study researchers were focused on the treatment of chromium sulphide total ammonia phenol and total oil fat the wastewater was treated using aspergillus sp 3 with a percentage reduction of concentration 89 09 83 05 56 36 48 48 95 09 respectively 63 3 7 reusability study the reusability or regeneration of adsorbent is a crucial factor to be considered in adsorption process especially in economic aspect and to be used in pilot scales 21 64 65 the zwitad undertaken chemical regeneration where it involved desorption using 1 m of sodium hydroxide naoh solution the regeneration of batik effluent was shown in figure s2 maximum 3 consecutives cycles of adsorption and desorption of batik wastewater achieved at the original ph the percentage removal was based on the reduction in absorbance value of batik effluent through uv vis spectrophotometer analysis the adsorption desorption of samples decreasing from 96 97 to 80 50 and finally at 21 91 removal decreasing in adsorption ability due to the presence of remaining adsorbed batik wastewater which was strongly attached on the zwitad active site while the other half might be through physical adsorption 64 the naoh solution was selected as solvent in order to change the solution ph so that it can easily attracted the dyes out from zwitad 66 different alkaline desorption agent such as ammonia solution na4oh also appropriate for desorbing dye contaminated adsorbents 67 the value of ph plays a significant role on the protonation and de protonation of functional groups of zwitad which affect the adsorption desorption behaviour 68 moreover in this study the ionic charged interaction was the main affecting factor for the adsorption to occur between zwitad and pollutants zwitad with a positive surface charge have high adsorption capability for batik wastewater therefore alkaline solution is considered as a proper eluents for desorbing dye molecules from adsorbents the high ph solutions weakened the electrostatic interactions between dye molecules and adsorption sites on the adsorbents and cause desorption of the dyes molecules from the adsorbents this result is due to the higher affinity of pollutants molecules to cationic parts of desorption agents na than to the positively functional group of zwitad furthermore the increase in number of the negatively charged functional groups on the zwitad may result in electrostatic repulsion and desorption of anionic dye molecule 67 in other word once zwitad was immersed in alkaline solution naoh dissociate into na and oh oh then attached to adsorbent and replaced the anionic dye the positive charged of zwitad become de protonation so that the electrostatic repulsion could play a dominant role in desorption process at the same time na attached to desorbed batik pollutants the equation below explained in brief about the mechanism involved in desorption of batik pollutants from zwitad zwitad batik wastewater zwitad batik wastewater adsorption zwitad batik na oh zwitad oh batik na desorption other literature applied naoh as solvent for their desorption especially on anionic dyes was also reported in 69 therefore the zwitad is a good potential as reusable adsorbent of ionic charged pollutants from wastewater 4 conclusion the physical treatment using zwitterionic adsorbent coating was successfully applied for the decolourisation of batik effluent the double stage of adsorption treatment using zwitad able to reduce the colour reading from 496 to 147 mg l ph value 10 90 to 7 34 and cod from 9800 to 128 admi the results indicated that the removal of colour ph and cod for the mixture of waste from boiling and rinsing discharged points met the acceptable limit of standard b the mechanism of batik adsorption can be ascribed through electrostatic interaction ph factor surface area of zwitad and chemical interaction as the adsorbent is in coating form the adsorbent can be easily separated from tank vessel without applying extra processing such as centrifugation filtration or magnetic field which are very common in other treatment techniques the implementation of zwitad is a promising and applicable treatment method for batik effluent less sludge generated efficient performance and lower treatment costs are the benefits for

13584,a novel adsorbent based coating with zwitterionic functionality zwitad was employed to treat the heavily polluted hand drawn batik industrial effluent the adsorbent was prepared as a coating and supported onto a cotton cloth by applying a simple preparation method based on the combined use of clay based adsorbent polymer based binder and cationic polyelectrolyte batik effluent which is known to have high chemical oxygen demand cod 412 2205 mg l and colour intensity 500 16900 admi has undertaken treatment process using zwitad the results showed a significant reduction of cod 147 mg l colour 128 admi and ph 7 34 which complied with the standard discharge limit for industrial effluent regulations the finding proved that zwitad is applicable to reduce the cod and colour intensity and stabilise the ph of water this new innovative treatment has simultaneously improved the effluent conditions and minimised operational costs and minimum secondary waste is generated the proposed application of zwitad at an industrial scale has also been introduced as a functional industrial storage tank with a feasible and practical operation keywords hand drawn batik effluent zwitterionic adsorbent coating colour removal cod admi industrial application 1 introduction the textile industry in malaysia is a mature industry since the country started the export oriented industrial transformation in the early 1970s 1 the textile industry is a significant contributor to malaysia s economy and is regarded as the backbone of one of the active developing industries in the country one of the best known traditional textile industries in malaysia including the southeast asia region indonesia thailand is the batik industry 2 4 batik production is expanding and has been commercialised and the industry contributes to positive economic growth in malaysia 3 more than 1 000 batik factories are located mainly throughout kelantan and terengganu on the east coast of malaysia where the industry becomes a significant source of occupation and income generation for the local people nevertheless behind the positive successful and growing progress of textile industries in malaysia it also acts as a double edged sword the ruinous is that the development of textile industries leaves a large footprint to the environment the significant pollution sources are due to the discharge of a large volume of water 500 l per day depending on size of textile produced containing synthetic waste dyes colour residues catalytic chemicals wax sodium silicate as fixing agents excess nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter sodium potassium magnesium calcium copper lead nickel and zinc 5 8 three major consecutive steps are involved in batik production soaking boiling and rinsing fig 1 each step produces contaminants and leads to the complexity of wastewater resulting in higher ph ph 11 13 chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss and colour intensity 3 4 8 the arising problem threatens the whole system including the biota flora and fauna the environment and the worst assuredly towards human health therefore the design of a textile effluent treatment plant should consider different organic pollutants as the pollution profile in each step may vary as recommended by several researchers and industrial players the ideal effluent treatment process should include an initial step of chemical treatment followed by biological treatment to remove organic matter 5 physical treatment should be implemented as the finishing step for the treatment plant e g adsorption membrane separation or other oxidation treatment processes using the method that can offer the lowest cost for a complete treatment the costs may include both capital expenditure capex and operational expenditure opex such as unit operation machine energy usage intensive labour maintenance disposal cost for high sludge generation and other expenses although the investment for wastewater treatment cannot be avoided in order to comply with the environmental regulatory discharge limits there are still rooms to minimise the costs as a reference the process flow diagram in figure s1 is one of the typical schematic designs of textile industries in malaysia that practice treatment systems in their production plants 5 chemical biological and physical methods are conventional treatment methods in an integrated wastewater treatment plant chemical treatment often demand a huge budget allocation due to a large amount of chemicals used even though they are excellent in decolourising wastewater besides the accumulation of concentrated sludge after coagulation and flocculation is a drawback of this conventional treatment biological treatment requires a large aerobic tank area due to long hydraulic retention time as the bacteria have a slow growth rate furthermore more sludge is produced in this step this method indirectly causes secondary pollution and creates a disposal problem at the polishing step the textile effluent is treated in an activated carbon column filter before the treated wastewater is discharged into water bodies thus among the treatment methods available physical chemical and biological physical treatment is the most effective approach as the finishing step in an effluent treatment plant the finishing step is essential and recommended as the treatment produces high quality treated effluent with free minimal contaminants and decolours the discharged water membrane filtration ion exchange and adsorption are among the most extensively used physical treatment methods 9 the limitations of membrane filtration include a short lifetime of a membrane before fouling occurs high working pressure and a costly membrane system 9 besides ion exchange is ineffective in removing several types of dyes e g reactive dyes the main drawback in adsorption is the adsorbent itself in terms of sludge disposal and regeneration factor 10 therefore by comparing these techniques the method with minimum limitations has been considered i e adsorption and further investigated according to the documented studies adsorption has been proven efficient in eliminating pollutants only if the adsorbent has a high removal rate adsorption capacity and sustainability 11 12 therefore this study aims to evaluate an alternative way of treating batik industrial effluent using a novel approach of zwitterionic adsorbent coating zwitad modifies the conventional adsorption concept powder pallet granule form of adsorbent which then transformed into a coating layer using a more straightforward synthesis procedure and flexible application the treatment is designed as a simple method to produce an acceptable effluent before discharging into water bodies instead of using activated carbon column which is more costing and complex the treated batik industrial effluent must comply with standard b of the regulations stipulated by the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 from the department of environment doe malaysia moreover in developing a batik industrial treatment system the economic aspect should be considered as most of the batik manufacturers built a small scale workshop factory and cannot afford expensive and complicated treatment this new innovative solution aims to simultaneously increase dye removal performance and reduce the energetic footprint by minimising operating costs and secondary waste generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 batik effluent samples the effluent samples were provided by a local batik manufacturer ipoh malaysia sampling bottles were rinsed with the samples prior to sample collection the samples were manually collected in a 30 l plastic container and preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c in accordance with the standard method the batik effluent was collected from four main discharged points as shown in fig 1 at i ii iii and iv in batik processing i e soaking boiling and two rinsing steps the samples were dark bluish with a high content of organic compounds the physicochemical characteristics of the wastewater were studied in terms of ph value cod and colour american dye manufacturers institute admi unit the scale used to measure the colour removal of wastewater as an indicator of water quality the main characteristics of the wastewater are presented in table 1 discussion section the batik wastewater exceeded the limit stated in the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 for a specific trade of the textile industry in malaysia therefore the direct discharge of batik effluent from this industry into water bodies is prohibited and the effluent needs to be treated accordingly the physicochemical parameters such as cod ph and colour were analysed based on the standard methods for examining batik effluent before and after the treatment the method for determination of cod in wastewater samples using cod digestion reagent vial 20 1500 mg l cod hr tests was based on the addition of 2 ml of batik sample to the vial which was heated in dbr200 reactor for 2 h at 150 c after cooling for 2 h the vial was inserted into the dr 6000 spectrophotometer model hach usa and the cod reading was measured the colour measurement was followed a standard method 2120 f using 1 inch sample cell and it was filled in with 10 ml of batik wastewater the admi of sample was determined using spectrophotometer 2 2 reagent and materials bentonite is a type of mineral clay were manufactured by sigma aldrich and used as received without further modification poly epichlorohydrin dimethyleamine epi dma used as cationic polyelectrolyte 50 wt in h2o and acrylic polymer emulsion ape as a binder were bought from nha scientific resource cyberjaya malaysia all reagent used were analytical grade and distilled water was used to prepare the sample coating dilution and solution preparation cotton thread cloth was purchased from local textile retailer parit buntar malaysia the solution ph was adjusted using analytical grade hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh solution both from r m chemical pdn malaysia 2 3 preparation of zwitad adsorbent coating a complete preparation method of zwitad on a small scale can be referred to previous studies 13 14 briefly zwitad is an adsorbent coating in a flat sheet layer compounded with a binder from acrylic polymer emulsion ape base bentonite as an additive distilled water as a carrier and epichlorohydrin dimethyl amine epidma as a surfactant in this study these components were mixed based on the formulated ratio and up scaled by 50 times the solution was stirred using a homogeniser ultra turrax t50 ika at 2 000 rpm for complete dissolution the zwitad solution was then transferred into a stainless steel container in a coating rig system for the coating process fig 2 the coating rig was designed based on an automation system to coat paint the zwitad solution onto the cotton cloth as a substrate support for large scale production representing the industrial application once the controller button was pushed and adjusted to 60 rpm the raw cotton cloth was automatically moved and immersed in the coating solution the sample was kept moving until one batch 1 m of the coated cotton was in the drying oven at this point the rig stopped for 10 min to allow the sample to dry completely in the oven with the temperature set at 80 c the coating process continued for the next batch until there was no more zwitad solution in the container the dried coated adsorbent was then rinsed using tap water to remove the residue uncoated coating or dust the samples were dried again in the oven at 80 c overnight and the final product named the zwitad strip is ready for treatment 2 4 batch adsorption experiment for adsorption experiment the batik effluent from releasing point ii after boiling the fabric with soda ash and point iii rinsed fabric with raw water was mixed at a ratio of 1 9 the mixed batik effluent was used for further analysis for the adsorbent the zwitad strip was cut to the dimensions of 20 cm 5 cm the amount of solid dried adsorbent coated onto the cotton cloth was 0 3 0 5 g which is equivalent to 1 strip 20cm 5cm as the zwitad is in a flat sheet form the strip was placed in the interior part of a 250 ml glass beaker the mixed batik effluent 200 ml was added into the glass beaker and gently stirred with a magnetic bar 350 rpm using a stirrer multi hotplate stirrer model wisd adsorption was performed at its original ph each experiment was repeated three times for reproducibility and accuracy the batik effluent was analysed using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer by monitoring the absorbance changes at the wavelength of maximum absorbance λmax the colour removal efficiency was obtained using eq 1 1 c o l o u r r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y a b s 0 a b s a b s o 100 where abs0 mg l is the initial absorbance value of batik effluent and abs mg l is the batik effluent concentration at time t min 2 5 reusability study the reusability study of zwitad was undertake chemical regeneration using 1 m of sodium hydroxide naoh solution the adsorbed zwitad was rinsed slightly with distilled water to clean the surface before undergo next cycle of adsorption after that the adsorption was performed similar as batch experiment in section 2 3 2 6 sample and adsorbent coating analysis the reduction in the colour intensity of batik effluent was analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu corporation kyoto japan the cod of batik effluent was measured using the reactor digestion method and analysed by hach dr 6000 hach usa the morphology of the zwitad strip was assessed using a scanning electron microscope crest system m sdn bhd quanta feg 450 with 100 and 2 500 magnification using an accelerating voltage of 20 kv an elemental composition analysis from energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was used to identify the elements inside zwitad a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscope ftir nicolet is10 was employed to detect the changes in the functional group of the amphoteric adsorbent surface before and after adsorption in the 4 000 400 cm 1 wavelength region and 4 cm 1 of spectral resolution the photographic images were captured for visual observation the isoelectric point of adsorbent coating used for the adsorption experiment was determined by using solid to liquid ratio of 1 1000 in the present study the samples strip with 0 2 g mass was added to 200 ml of distilled water with varying ph 2 12 and stirred for 24 h the δph ph final ph initial of the solution was plotted against initial ph of the solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis results and performance studied of batik wastewater the major consecutive steps involved in batik production and the generated waste are presented in the schematic diagram shown in fig 2 the process starts with hand drawing followed by drying at atmospheric temperature the fabric is moved to a silicate container and immersed for less than 30 min to fix the colour on the fabric the procedure is continued by rinsing the fabric using raw water to soften the fabric at this point the wastewater is first generated with a high concentration of silicate residues at point ii wastewater is generated from a boiling pan where the fabric is boiled with soda ash this step is one of the important procedures in removing wax painted on the fabric at the beginning of the process the effluent contains a high concentration of silicate and wax the fabric is again rinsed with raw water twice to remove excess wax point iii and subsequently the fabric is scented where the effluent is generated at point iv the procedure ends with the drying of the fabric at ambient temperature the batik manufacturing stages are almost identical among operators especially in painting boiling and rinsing of the fabric 15 19 therefore the effluent samples in this study were collected at points ii and iii the effluent at point ii was chosen due to the high concentration of colour and the rinsing water at point iii was used as a dilution solution for point ii effluent without make used of other sources of clean raw water both effluent was mixed with a 1 9 ratio prior to adsorption using zwitad strip the volume of raw water used to rinse the fabric iii is about 9 10 times higher than effluent in sample ii therefore it was estimated that the 1 9 is an appropriate ratio to dilute the wastewater sample the uv vis absorption spectra of mixed batik wastewater showed an absorption peak at 437 nm as shown in fig 3 the peak appeared in a visible region 437 nm indicating the existence of chromophores responsible for imparting colour to the batik effluent 18 the values of cod concentration ph and colour for each sample before the treatment are shown in table 1 the effluent of each step has different contents of cod colour and ph with significantly high values for all the parameters involved the cod values are 2 205 and 412 mg l at the releasing points ii and iii respectively and the mixed point recorded the cod value of 496 mg l as compared to another batik manufacturer the cod values were differs according to the volume and types of synthetic dyes used in textiles colouring the cod were ranging from 30 13 600 ppm starting from soaking boiling to rinsing steps as well as their ph 11 13 8 a higher admi value 16 900 at releasing point ii is due to the release of un coated dye from the fabric during boiling process the mixed points ii and iii recorded the value of 9 800 admi thus a thoroughgoing treatment is still required before discharging each sample was compared to standard b of the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 after the first treatment using a single strip of zwitad the cod concentration reduced to approximately 67 9 and complied with the allowable discharge limit 159 mg l however for the first stage of adsorption the colour was not effectively removed as the remaining colour had 250 admi the second stage of adsorption was carried out to obtain a value below the allowable discharge limit especially for colour reduction in the second treatment the cod concentration admi and ph passed the standard limit where the values were reduced to 147 mg l of cod 128 admi and ph 7 34 table 2 the images of zwitad strips were taken before and after adsorption the original zwitad strips were white but turned greenish after the batik effluent adsorbed onto the strips fig 4 a the dye pigments from batik wastewater were evenly distributed onto the zwitad surface and imparted the greenish colour the image of mixed batik effluent at points ii and iii is exhibited in fig 4 b producing a clear solution after the treatment the decolourisation of batik effluent was analysed using the uv vis spectra as shown in fig 5 the reduction in the adsorption peak λmax at 437 nm was observed for every 1 h adsorption interval initially the absorbance value was 0 954 and decreased to 0 474 0 291 0 204 0 142 0 104 and 0 082 each hour for 6 h of contact time fig 6 shows the cod concentration according to the respective ph series and their percentage removal after the zwitad treatment before adjusting the ph the mixed batik effluent from points ii and iii was originally at ph 10 9 as can be seen the percentage removal decreased from 65 to 21 as the ph increased from 3 to 9 and increased significantly to 69 1 toward ph 11 the cod concentration showed the highest reduction at ph 5 134 mg l followed by ph 11 157 mg l the lowest reduction was observed at ph 9 with 229 mg l the isoelectric point of zwitad is 8 2 fig 7 at this ph the difference between the initial and the final h or oh is zero this is the point at which they exhibited amphoteric characteristic of the materials 20 the zwitad surface is positively charged when the ph of the solution is 8 2 which favours the anionic species of dyes while at higher ph 8 2 the negatively charged adsorbent surface favours cationic species therefore from the results obtained the zwitad could function in both acidic ph 3 and alkaline ph 11 conditions probably because the dye content in batik effluent consists of cationic and anionic species the amphoteric functionality of zwitad is proven by its ability to remove batik dyes at various ph values thus the findings suggest that zwitad could reduce the cod concentration at any ph from acidic to alkaline condition this feature is advantageous for zwitad as the condition of wastewater effluent differs from one industry to another furthermore the cod values are below 250 mg l for each ph studied and complied with standard b of the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 for the textile industry the result is consistent with earlier literature of yabo et al 2016 where the dye pollutants cationic and anionic were fairly stable in a relatively wide ph range of 4 8 21 similar findings were also observed in other studies 22 23 fig 8 exhibits the performance of zwitad for mixing and static conditions in batik effluent treatment a significant difference could be seen for both conditions in the presence of mixing effect the adsorption contact time was sped up and the percentage removal was higher than the static condition within 1 h of adsorption the mixing mode achieved 50 removal compared to only 6 in the static mode in 24 h the zwitad recorded 91 4 and 83 removal for mixing and static conditions respectively nevertheless even in a static condition and longer contact time zwitad could still functioned well to adsorb the pollutants in the solution this attribute can be as an added advantage if the effluent is placed in a simpler container or storage tank without a mixing facility to treat wastewater mixing effect is vital in adsorption in the presence of agitation the kinetic of dye molecules enables the bulk liquid to be adsorbed to the adsorbent boundary layer due to enhanced turbulence in the solution thus confirming that the external diffusion played a significant role on the adsorption kinetic of the solution 24 previous studied proved that the rate of removal increased with the increased in agitation rate 25 3 2 characterizations of zwitad scanning electron microscopy sem was performed to investigate the surface morphology of zwitad with low and high magnification of 100 fig 9 a and 2 500 fig 9b respectively the dried adsorbent coated onto a weaving linkage pattern with loosely spiral cellulose fibre of cotton cloth can be observed clearly from the images at 2 500 magnification the single thread is visibly coated with the adsorbent and covered the cotton cloth fig 9c strong coating between the adsorbent and substrate is an important factor to prevent leaching and peeling off of the material in addition zwitad strip is a non porous materials seem there have no obvious pore exhibited from the sem image it can be inferred from bet surface area and porosity result as shown in table 3 however with this non porous structure zwitad still can contribute to positive adsorption performance through other types of interaction mechanism further discussion in surface area section after adsorption process the morphology of zwitad showed no noticeable changes compared to the morphology before treatment fig 9 similar finding were observed from other coating studied that used cotton fabric as adsorbent support or substrate their characterization through sem capture was clearly observed that the spherical particles of adsorbent were closely attached to a cotton fiber and demonstrate that the coating was not peeled off from the cotton fiber by ultrasound 14 26 29 the elemental chemical composition of zwitad was analysed using edx spectroscopy the graph presents the detected elements in the pristine zwitad strip and zwitad after batik effluent adsorption fig 10 a and b strong bands of metal elements such as silicon si aluminium al titanium ti calcium ca and magnesium mg could be observed in each graph this finding establishes the existence of ape and bentonite in zwitad and indicates proper blending of adsorbent coating additionally non metal elements chlorine carbon and oxygen were also detected in the graphs besides the presence of chlorine cl element is from the epidma surfactant as can be referred from its molecular structure 30 however cl was eliminated after adsorption this might be due to the adsorption of pollutants onto the zwitad strip and the dyes have recovered the surfaces from the batik effluent eventually cl could not be traced while edx analysis was performed 14 31 3 3 ftir analysis of zwitad the infrared spectra of the functional groups and structural components of the samples were investigated using ftir spectroscopy the prepared pristine zwitad and zwitad after treatment were compared and presented in fig 11 a strong and sharp absorption band at 1 000 1 050 cm 1 is due to the si o si stretching vibration for both samples before and after adsorption with different peak intensities 8 32 there are also several peaks between 750 and 950 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching bands of fe oh mg oh and al oh derived from layered aluminosilicate of bentonite and several components in ape binder 33 broad and medium intensity bending vibrations are present between 1 420 and 1 480 cm 1 suggesting the intercalation of epidma inside the bentonite interlayer 34 the absorption band at 1700 cm 1 indicates the co stretching of carbonyl carboxyl and acetyl groups this band appeared at the line spectrum of zwitad before the treatment and the peak has higher intensity after batik effluent adsorption extra peaks that appeared at 2 900 3 100 cm 1 are attributed to the vibration of nh stretching from the amine group and asymmetric and symmetric stretch of hch which might originate from the dyes used in batik production adsorbed onto the zwitad strip in general after the adsorption of batik effluent onto adsorbent coating the spectrum of the zwitad showing reduction in their band intensity where the functional groups either shifted in frequency or disappeared in some cases these spectral changes specify the possible association or connection of various functional groups from zwitad surface during the adsorption process the similar trend of shifting or disappearing of bonding can be found in previous studies 35 36 the surface area of adsorbent is one of the important factors affecting its adsorption behaviour and performance in the present study the surface properties of zwitad were analysed based on the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm using brunauer emmett teller bet method and their corresponding properties are summarised in table 3 the bet surface area total pore volume and external surface area of zwitad are 2 7482 m2 g 0 0018 cm3 g and 4 6439 m2 g respectively the average pore size of zwitad recorded diameter of 26 0318 nm corresponding to a mesoporous adsorbent a material with a porous structure would significantly increase the effective surface area and available active sites contributing to positive adsorption performance 37 referring to the classification of iupac pore dimensions adsorbent pores are classified into micropore with a diameter less than 2 nm mesopore with a diameter between 2 and 50 nm and macropore with a diameter more than 50 nm 38 the surface area of zwitad is comparable with other adsorbents prepared by previous researchers 39 the surface areas of chitosan and modified chitosan are 0 29 and 1 32 m2 g respectively the porosity of the zwitad strip 20 cm 5 cm was calculated yielding the porosity of 2 614 therefore it can be inferred that although the surface area average pore size and porosity give relatively minimum results these properties are still useful for zwitad as an adsorbent to adsorb pollutants coupled with the charged interaction or existing surface bonding 3 4 adsorption mechanism of zwitad adsorption is a surface occurrence where an adsorbent entraps dye molecules through either or both physical and chemical interactions this process depends strongly on the types of adsorbate auxochrome or chromophore and surface chemistry of adsorbents particle size surface area temperature ph contact time 40 in addition multiple adsorption interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate would also involve electrostatic interaction 34 41 chemical surface complexation 42 43 chemisorption 44 45 pore filling 46 47 ion exchange diffusion 48 49 hydrogen bonding interaction 11 50 lewis acid lewis base interaction 43 51 van der waals forces 52 53 hydrophobic reaction 54 55 and π π stacking interaction 41 56 57 the possible surface interaction between the zwitad strip and pollutants from batik effluent can be ascribed to electrostatic attraction surface area chemical bonding and other developed bonds such as hydrogen bonding fig 12 the batik effluent which is a mixture of various dyes will interact with the functional groups on the surfaces of zwitad the protonated amine nh3 which is basically from cationic dyes and the sulfonyl groups so3 from anionic dyes would be the main charges in the effluent solution adsorption occurs by electrostatic interaction once the positively charged dyes are attracted to the negatively charged groups of zwitad si oˉ ca oˉ ti oˉ and al oˉ these functional groups are originally from bentonite clay and ape with the major components of alumina silica calcium and titanium refer to the edx results similar interaction can be found from other studied through negatively charged dye anions r so3 and the positively charged adsorbent sites nh3 from functionalized montmorillonite 50 58 the zwitterionic surface charge of the zwitad initiate the electrostatic interactions and play a primary role in the adsorption mechanism of ionic batik waste together with the other interactions that are responsible for the adsorption besides a number of hydroxyl groups oh from the zwitad surface create an interaction between the nh3 groups of dyes eventually creating strong hydrogen bonding besides the positive ions at the zwitad surface are from the intercalation of epidma molecules onto bentonite and ape besides since the surface area of zwitad is low it outcome is insignificant on the adsorption mechanism regardless of a low surface area value the zwitad adsorption capacity still high 59 another important factor that also plays a vital role in adsorption is the ph of the dye solution the charges of solution can alter the surface charge of the adsorbent consequently affecting the dye sorption efficiency the degree of ionisation would also affect the solubility of dyes and the dissociation of surface functional groups on the active sites of the adsorbent in an acidic medium the adsorbent surface is protonated due to the availability of a large number of h ions which attract available anions from the medium if the effluent exists as an anionic dye it contains mostly the sulfonated group so3na charged in an aqueous medium therefore electrostatic attraction will occur between the protonated zwitad surface and anionic dye hence higher removal of anionic dye could be observed in an acidic medium meanwhile the removal efficiency of anionic dye will decrease when the ph of the anionic solution is in the alkaline range this is due to the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic dye and deprotonated adsorbent surface in addition the availability of oh ions in an alkaline medium also competes with the anionic dye resulting in lower removal efficiency of anionic dyes the other observation based on adsorption mechanism can be referred in few related studied 60 62 3 5 proposed application of zwitad at an industrial level at an industrial level the application of zwitad is proposed in a simple yet practical operation normally an activated carbon column facility is installed at the finishing part of a certain wastewater treatment plant to further polish the treated effluent and decolourised the discharged water positive performance is offered with this advanced and sophisticated treatment but there are still drawbacks in the process an activated carbon column requires higher equipment and facility costs as it is the most energy intensive process to operate the system pressurised pumps electricity the costs also cover the installation of the column costly adsorbent production piping system arrangement and complex maintenance procedures such as cleaning and replacement of the equipment and adsorbent therefore a simple approach of treatment for the finishing step is proposed by replacing the activated carbon column with a functional industrial storage tank fig 13 it is suggested that zwitad is laminated or slotted in the interior part of the storage tank and while in operation the rotator is turned on for better adsorption performance the storage tank can be designed as a batch or continuous system with feasible operation 3 6 specification of batik effluent based on environmental quality regulations additional analyses including bod 5 day test suspended solids oil and grease and heavy metal detection were also conducted table 4 these analyses aimed to identify the percentage reduction and compare the concentration of each element with the standard specification from the environmental quality industrial effluent regulation 2009 the bod 5 fluoride and oil and grease in batik effluent exceeded the standard specification and required treatment before discharging after the treatment with zwitad significant changes could be observed in the concentration reduction especially for oil and grease 99 1 followed by fluoride 88 23 and bod 5 50 7 other detected elements were manganese and zinc with very minimum concentrations of 0 04 and 0 2 mg l respectively the suspended solids could be reduced by approximately 78 72 after the treatment therefore by considering these promising results zwitad proved its capability in adsorbing various pollutants as compared to other study different batik manufacturer will produce different chemical properties of batik effluents payam et al 2016 evaluated and treated the real batik wastewater through sequential process of acidification magnesium oxide and palm shell based activated carbon the detected heavy metals were pb fe cu zn al mg ca cr and si while there was no mn detected in the sample of wastewater after undergone those three treatment the cod concentration was reduced to 50 mg l and the concentration of heavy metals decrease below the standard a or b 8 in another study researchers were focused on the treatment of chromium sulphide total ammonia phenol and total oil fat the wastewater was treated using aspergillus sp 3 with a percentage reduction of concentration 89 09 83 05 56 36 48 48 95 09 respectively 63 3 7 reusability study the reusability or regeneration of adsorbent is a crucial factor to be considered in adsorption process especially in economic aspect and to be used in pilot scales 21 64 65 the zwitad undertaken chemical regeneration where it involved desorption using 1 m of sodium hydroxide naoh solution the regeneration of batik effluent was shown in figure s2 maximum 3 consecutives cycles of adsorption and desorption of batik wastewater achieved at the original ph the percentage removal was based on the reduction in absorbance value of batik effluent through uv vis spectrophotometer analysis the adsorption desorption of samples decreasing from 96 97 to 80 50 and finally at 21 91 removal decreasing in adsorption ability due to the presence of remaining adsorbed batik wastewater which was strongly attached on the zwitad active site while the other half might be through physical adsorption 64 the naoh solution was selected as solvent in order to change the solution ph so that it can easily attracted the dyes out from zwitad 66 different alkaline desorption agent such as ammonia solution na4oh also appropriate for desorbing dye contaminated adsorbents 67 the value of ph plays a significant role on the protonation and de protonation of functional groups of zwitad which affect the adsorption desorption behaviour 68 moreover in this study the ionic charged interaction was the main affecting factor for the adsorption to occur between zwitad and pollutants zwitad with a positive surface charge have high adsorption capability for batik wastewater therefore alkaline solution is considered as a proper eluents for desorbing dye molecules from adsorbents the high ph solutions weakened the electrostatic interactions between dye molecules and adsorption sites on the adsorbents and cause desorption of the dyes molecules from the adsorbents this result is due to the higher affinity of pollutants molecules to cationic parts of desorption agents na than to the positively functional group of zwitad furthermore the increase in number of the negatively charged functional groups on the zwitad may result in electrostatic repulsion and desorption of anionic dye molecule 67 in other word once zwitad was immersed in alkaline solution naoh dissociate into na and oh oh then attached to adsorbent and replaced the anionic dye the positive charged of zwitad become de protonation so that the electrostatic repulsion could play a dominant role in desorption process at the same time na attached to desorbed batik pollutants the equation below explained in brief about the mechanism involved in desorption of batik pollutants from zwitad zwitad batik wastewater zwitad batik wastewater adsorption zwitad batik na oh zwitad oh batik na desorption other literature applied naoh as solvent for their desorption especially on anionic dyes was also reported in 69 therefore the zwitad is a good potential as reusable adsorbent of ionic charged pollutants from wastewater 4 conclusion the physical treatment using zwitterionic adsorbent coating was successfully applied for the decolourisation of batik effluent the double stage of adsorption treatment using zwitad able to reduce the colour reading from 496 to 147 mg l ph value 10 90 to 7 34 and cod from 9800 to 128 admi the results indicated that the removal of colour ph and cod for the mixture of waste from boiling and rinsing discharged points met the acceptable limit of standard b the mechanism of batik adsorption can be ascribed through electrostatic interaction ph factor surface area of zwitad and chemical interaction as the adsorbent is in coating form the adsorbent can be easily separated from tank vessel without applying extra processing such as centrifugation filtration or magnetic field which are very common in other treatment techniques the implementation of zwitad is a promising and applicable treatment method for batik effluent less sludge generated efficient performance and lower treatment costs are the benefits for
