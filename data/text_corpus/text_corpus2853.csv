coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the minerals and metals present in alkaline ionized water were analyzed by using icp oes model varian 725 es 2 4 experimental 2 4 1 construction of batch ionizer a batch ionizer device was designed and developed in house for production of alkaline ionized water the device consists of two hdpe tanks of 20 l capacity that were interconnected with slots for incorporation of a flat sheet membrane and electrodes these slots were fitted with nylon pipes supported with rubber o rings and tightened with ss clamps to build a complete leak proof system the ionizer was designed flexible for manual replacement of any flat sheet membrane the positive and negative terminals of a dc adapter were connected to the electrodes using silicone sealant glue and immersed in each of the hdpe tanks the tanks were filled with water in equal proportions wherein the metal plates function as anode and cathode upon power supply the tank with cathode is cathode chamber where as the one with anode is anode chamber the membrane was incorporated between the tanks to prevent the intermixing of water from one tank to the other pvc taps were provided at the bottom of the tanks for collection of water 2 4 2 experimental procedure the membrane was incorporated between anode and cathode chambers along with supporting spacers by adjusting the ss clamp the anode and cathode chambers were filled simultaneously with ground water and nanofiltration potable water respectively to avoid mixing due to hydrostatic pressure difference between the two chambers before starting the experiment tds and ph of drinking water present in the cathode chamber ranges from 50 150 mg l and 6 5 7 respectively where as that in the anode chamber ranges from 250 300 mg l and 7 8 respectively the power supply to the electrodes was switched on and the water samples from both the chambers were measured for ph and tds at regular intervals of time electrolysis of water causes an increase in water ph in cathode chamber and decrease in ph in anode chamber the power supply is ceased until ph becomes constant or 10 fig 1 shows the overall process flow diagram for production of alkaline water from a ground surface water resource 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 corrosion rate the corrosion rate of the electrode was measured by using weight loss analysis method given by eq 1 1 c r w l k a t e where cr is the corrosion rate in mils per year mpy wl is the weight loss of the electrode g k is the k factor as per the units of area considered is the alloy density g cm3 a is the exposed area cm2 and te is the time of exposure h 2 5 2 dpph scavenging method dpph is 1 1 diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl a stable free radical widely used to determine the antioxidant capacity by spectrophotometric method the antioxidant activity of alkaline ionized water samples was measured by dpph radical scavenging method wherein the samples of varying concentrations were prepared in methanol 26 l ascorbic acid was used as standard about 3 5 ml of dpph 0 06 mm in methanol was added to each of the sample solutions 0 1 ml and thoroughly mixed the absorbance measurements

dpph as the blank reference all experiments were performed in triplet at room temperature absorbance was converted to the dpph radical scavenging rate according to the eq 2 2 d p p h r a d i c a l s c a v e n g i n g r a t e a c o n t r o l a s a m p l e a c o n t r o l 100 where acontrol and asample were the absorbance of control and sample respectively 2 5 3 working mechanism of alkaline ionizer the device works on the principle of water electrolysis the anode chamber and cathode chamber were filled with mineral enriched ground water and potable water purified by nanofiltration simultaneously upon switching on the power supply to the ionizer device electric potential difference occurs across the electrodes where in oxidation and reduction reactions occur at anode and cathode respectively as shown below the oxidation reactions that occur near anode generate h ion and oh ions the oh ions loose electrons to positively charged anode to produce o2 which leads to increase of h ion concentration in the anode chamber thus the water ph in anode chamber gradually decreases the mechanism for generation of alkaline and acidic water is shown in fig 2 the reduction reactions near the cathode generate h ions and oh ions the h ions take up the electrons from negatively charged cathode to produce h2 and active hydrogen that results in accumulation of oh ions in the cathode chamber these ions cause alkalinity to the reduced water in cathode chamber the h2 and active hydrogen evolved near the cathode partially dissolve in alkaline water oxidation at anode 4h2o 4e 4oh 4h 4e 4oh o2 2h2o 4e 2h2o o2 4h 4e overall reaction reduction at cathode 2h2o 2e 2oh 2h 2e 2h 2e h2 2h 2e 2h active hydrogen 2h2o 2e h2 2oh overall reaction under the influence of electric potential difference across the electrodes the cationic minerals present in the anode chamber move towards the cathode selectively through cation selective membrane thus the reduced alkaline water in cathode chamber is enriched with essential minerals which further enhance the production of hydroxyl ions and hydrogen in alkaline water increasing the ph of alkaline water even more 2 6 membrane synthesis membrane plays a vital role in development of water ionizer for production of alkaline water membrane acts as a diaphragm to separate anode and cathode chamber and helps to avoid direct intermixing of fluid levels in both the chambers moreover the selective permeability of membrane allows transfer of cationic minerals from anode chamber to cathode chamber facilitating the enrichment of essential minerals such sodium calcium magnesium potassium and iron in alkaline water this phenomenon increases the electrolysis process efficiency membrane is also essential to curb the mix up of gases released near the electrodes for suppose mix up of chlorine gas released near the anode into alkaline water in cathode chamber which otherwise would impart oxidizing nature to the water and make it unfit for drinking in the present investigation polymer based ultrafiltration membranes and cation exchange membranes were indigenously synthesized and characterized for application in water electrolysis pes pes pva peg based ultrafiltration membranes and spes pvc blend cation exchange membranes were synthesized for this purpose commercial cmi 7000 cation exchange membrane and polyurethane foam barriers were also used to enable comparative studies on electrolysis performance 2 6 1 pes membrane synthesis polyethersulfone offers high durability and mechanical strength to prepare the membrane 23 w v of polyethersulfone pes was mixed with 3 propionic acid in dimethyl formamide dmf solvent the resultant polymer solution is allowed to de aerate such that the polymer solution is bubble free the pes polymer solution is cast on a nonwoven polyester fabric support using an automatic casting machine to achieve the desired thickness the casted membrane is immediately immersed in an ice cold water bath for phase inversion thus obtained membrane is ultraporous in nature with a mwco of 5 kda 2 6 2 pes pva peg membrane synthesis ultraporous pes pva peg blend membrane was synthesized by phase inversion technique a solvent mixture was prepared by dissolving 1 33 w w ethanol in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp polymers measuring 13 75 pes 12 9 pva 4 52 peg were gradually added for dissolution in the nmp solvent mixture by continuous stirring and heating at 60 c for 5 h thus obtained homogenous polymer solution was casted on a glass plate using an automatic casting machine the glass plate along with the casted polymer solution was immediately transferred to a water immersion bath for phase inversion the water molecules replace the solvent molecules to form an ultraporous membrane the pva blending imparts high hydrophilic properties and mechanical strength to the membrane whereas peg blending enhances the anti fouling properties of the membrane addition of volatile ethanol solvent increases the porosity and pore size of the membrane 2 6 3 spes pvc ion exchange membrane synthesis nonporous dense ion exchange membrane is synthesized by blending pes and polyvinyl chloride pvc initially pes was sulfonated by dissolution of 15 pes in concentrated sulphuric acid the sulfonated polymer was precipitated in a cold water bath and water washed to attain neutral ph the obtained sulfonated polyethersulfone spes polymer was dried and 15 spes was dissolved in nmp similarly 12 pvc was also dissolved in nmp spes pvc blend was prepared by mixing equal proportions of both the polymer solutions to attain a homogenous bubble free solution the blend solution was then poured into a petri dish and kept at 40 50 c to attain dense membrane by solvent evaporation the blending technique imparts mechanic strength to the membrane and controls the extent of membrane swelling 3 results discussion the basic design and principle of alkaline ionizer were explored in the present study to produce potable alkaline ionized water various electrode materials and membrane techniques were investigated in the process of development of the proposed low cost ionizer as they prominently affect the quality of water and economics of electrolysis in the present study the performance of the ionizer was evaluated for anti corrosive properties of the electrodes and mineral enrichment capability of membrane to achieve maximum alkalinity all the experiments were conducted at least for three times and the average of the resulting value was reported the maximum error value was observed to be 0 02 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 pes membrane characterization 3 1 1 1 sem of pes membrane figs 3 and 4 show the sem images of surface and cross section of the membrane the surface is uniform and porous with no agglomerations that indicate proper miscibility of polymer in the solvent the cross sectional sem image also shows even distribution of polymer on the non woven

cs vibration peaks appeared at 1488 cm 1 27 the ch stretching peaks of benzene ring were observed at 2909 cm 1 the peaks in range of 3000 to 3600 cm 1 attribute to hydroxyl group stretching 28 the coc bond characteristic peaks were visible at 1050 cm 1 the aromatic cc bending characteristic peaks appeared at 1633 cm 1 3 1 1 3 xrd of pes membrane the xrd of pes membrane seen in fig 6 exhibits that the membrane is neither crystalline nor amorphous the membrane is found to be semi crystalline and found aptly suitable for the purpose of study 3 1 2 pes pva peg membrane characterization 3 1 2 1 sem of pes pva peg membrane figs 7 and 8 represent the sem images of surface and cross sectional morphologies of pes pva peg membrane the sem image of pes pva peg membrane shows highly porous surface compared to pes membrane probably due to the use of highly volatile ethanol solvent for its synthesis the cross sectional morphology depicts uniform distribution of polymer blend layer on the support fabric 3 1 2 2 ftir of pes pva peg membrane fig 9 shows the ftir image of pes pva peg membrane the coc groups of peg were observed at 1122 cm 1 the ch group appears at 2844 cm 1 29 the oh hydroxyl

in fig 10 depicts two wide peaks that indicate the semi crystalline nature of the membrane though the membrane is more crystalline in nature compared to the pes membrane 3 1 3 spes pvc ion exchange membrane characterization 3 1 3 1 sem of spes pvc ion exchange membrane sem image of the spes pvc blend membrane is shown in fig 11 reveals that the surface of the membrane is rough small sized lumps are observed on the surface morphology of the dense membrane due to insufficient miscibility of polyvinylchloride with sulfonated polyethersulfone 3 1 3 2 ftir of spes pvc ion exchange membrane fig 12 shows ftir graph of spes pvc membrane the peaks at 1577 cm 1 and 1484 cm 1 acknowledge the vibration of aromatic ring skeleton the peak at 1011 cm 1 shows the increase of degree of sulfonation which reveals the presence of aromatic so3h symmetric stretching vibration 31 the ftir spectroscopy also shows another distinct peak at 3420 cm 1 which is associated with the stretching of the hydroxyls of sulfonic acid groups 32 33 these results confirm the insertion of sulfonic acid groups onto the polymer backbone the c cl stretching region is observed in the range from 600 700 cm 1 cc stretching in the range of 900 1200 cm 1 and pvc numerous ch modes in 1250 2970 cm 1 range 34 ch bond stretching is observed at 2922 cm 1 ch2 groups deformation at 1309 cm 1 and ccl bond stretching at 871 cm 1 both spectra were very similar to that for pure pvc but revealed characteristic peaks for the polymer bands at 3447 cm 1 corresponding to the angular deformation of oh groups at 2922 cm 1 due to ccc and hch angular deformation 35 3 1 3 3 xrd of spes pvc ion exchange membrane the xrd patterns of plain and sulfonated membranes were shown in fig 13 which consistently follow bragg s law correlation of nλ 2dsinθ in which λ is wavelength n is an integer d represents planar spacing and θ is the angle spes and pvc blend membrane exhibited flat xrd patterns that indicate amorphous nature of the dense polymeric blend membrane 3 2 selection of electrodes electrode material plays a vital role in electrolysis most of capital investment in construction of ionizer is incurred for electrode material use of durable and safe electrode materials is highly crucial for sustainable operation and maintenance of an ionizer stainless steel is one of the most predominantly used low cost electrode materials but its use for alkaline electrolysis is very limited in the present study firstly washers made of ss316 l and ss304 materials were used as electrodes for ionizer batch operations of electrolysis were conducted in the ionizer for 23 h and the observations reveal that the ph of water in cathode chamber of ionizer increased from 7 to 9 5 where as orp varied from 200 mv to 150 mv at the same time the color of anode was observed to be brownish imparting some of its color to the water present in anode chamber the color change of the electrode was associated with weight loss of the electrode and may be attributed to anode corrosion due to oxidation reactions as shown in fig 14 a and b the corrosion rate for ss316 l and ss304 electrodes calculated by weight loss method was estimated to be 3189531 895 14 mpy and 23 275 62 mpy respectively to overcome anode corrosion ss316 l electrode was subjected to surface modification by using a thermo chemical technique named plasma nitridation that transforms the metallic surface into compound layers with high wear resistance due to the diffusion of ionic nitrogen 36 as shown in fig 14 c the experimental observations of electrolysis with nitrided ss316 l electrode as anode also exhibited corrosion where in the compound layers of modified surface were shredded out and the electrode was corroded as shown in fig 14 d further cost effective graphite material was used as anode in the ionizer and the electrolysis performance was studied despite the good electrical conducting properties the surface of graphite anode decomposed as shown in fig 15 though graphite electrode shows little deterioration compared to plasma nitrided ss316 l anode higher rate of increase in alkalinity were observed with the later one compared to that of graphite although the electrode materials ss304 ss316 l graphite have shown good electrolysis performance the durability of anode and sustainability of the device developed were uncertain titanium material is extensively used as anode in several applications due to good electrochemical properties high corrosion resistance and high thermal stability moreover titanium material can also perform superiorly even in acidic environments organic solvents and over voltage conditions titanium anode was also proven to be a better alternative for graphite electrode 37 thus titanium electrode though a little more cost intensive compared to afore mentioned materials was chosen for use as anode in electrolysis for production of alkaline reduced water fig 16 shows the comparative electrolysis performance of titanium anodes with other anode materials where as ss316 l was commonly used as cathode in all the experimental trials unlike anode usage of ss316 l as cathode material did not result in corrosion alteration of the electrode use of titanium as anode and ss316 l as cathode in electrolysis for production of alkaline ionized water resulted in high rate of increase in alkalinity moreover no weight loss or color change of the electrode was observed the electrode performance did not alter much even after its continuous usage for more than six months 3 3 selection of membrane electrolysis process occurs whenever a direct current is supplied to cathode and anode placed in an electrolytic medium a membrane is often not required for the process to occur though its application may have several added advantages membrane acts as a diaphragm when placed between anode and cathode chambers by prevention of free bulk water and electrode gas mixing while allowing selective permeation of ions between the two chambers thus membrane plays a crucial role in maintaining and enhancing the product water quality in electrode chambers in the present study several membranes of flat sheet configuration were synthesized to suite the design of the water ionizer device a porous polyurethane foam sponge in house synthesized pes based high flux ultraporous membranes pes and pes pva peg spes pvc blend cation exchange membrane and a commercial cation exchange membrane cmi 7000 were used in the study to evaluate the performance of water ionizer all the valuation studies were conducted using the in house designed ionizer as mentioned in section 2 construction of batch ionizer that uses a 36 v dc adapter ss316 l electrode as cathode and titanium electrode as anode the surface area of electrode and membrane used were 15 32 cm2 and 38 5 cm2 respectively the ionizer is operated till the water in cathode chamber has attained maximum alkalinity with constant ph profile the variations in total dissolved solids tds ph and orp were recorded with operating time to evaluate the membrane performance in the ionizer the electrolysis performance using different type of membranes of ionizer to attain a ph around 9 was shown in table 2 it was observed that the performance of pes ultrafiltration membrane was better compared to spes pvc and commercial cmi 7000 ion exchange membranes till attainment of 9 ph in cathode chamber where in the fluxes were recorded as 1 4 1 17 and 1 42 l h 1 respectively the observations reveal that the performance of ionizer with pes and cmi 7000 membranes results in better flux and orp compared to other membranes though use of pes pva peg membrane resulted in better orp 250 mv and maximum ph 9 97 the flux attained was observed to be low 1 33 l h 1 to understand water mixing and ion exchange between fluids present in electrode chambers of the ionizer the electrolysis performance was observed without the use of any membrane the variations in tds profile of the water in anode and cathode tanks were observed over a period of operating time as shown in fig 17 the observations reveal that without the use of membrane tds of alkaline water increased rapidly from 75 to 272 mg l within one hour of electrolysis operation whereas with use of a membrane separating the electrode tanks the tds profile was observed as nearly constant though the electrolysis performance is merely the same with or without the use of membrane the quality of water in cathode tank degrades due to intermixing of hardness causing salts gases or microbes from anode tank thus obtained alkaline water may not be suitable for drinking purpose incorporation of membrane between the electrode tanks however leads to slight elevation in tds of alkaline water upto 20 mg l due to enrichment of cationic minerals in comparison to the performance of ionizer without any membrane the performance of foam sponge was better with a flux of 1 22 l h electrolysis without membrane lead to higher increase of ph till 9 84 but on the other hand tds of water in the cathode tank has increased from 90 to 300 mg l from very initial readings this is an indication for intermixing of water in both anode and cathode chambers the resultant water was alkaline but may not be suitable for drinking purpose as the salts contributing to hardness and gases from anode chamber easily seep into cathode chamber with incorporation of membrane into the electrolyser no increase in tds of water 20 mg l was seen in both the electrode chambers fig 17 shows the tds levels in both cathode and anode without use of membrane and with use of pes membrane for production of alkaline ionized water a comparative performance of ionizer with use of different membranes is well understood from fig 18 the graph shows increase in ph of water in cathode chamber with operating time pes membrane was observed to be a better barrier for increase in ph of water from 8 to 9 where as cem 7000 exhibited better performance for higher ph range of 9 5 10 owing to the high cost of the imported ion exchange membranes pes membrane may be considered as the ideal membrane for development of an indigenous cost effective ionizer nevertheless it is also necessary to check the water quality for elemental analysis to ensure its compatibility for potable application 3 3 1 elemental analysis of water ground surface water and filtered water were used as feed to the anode chamber of the electrolyser the metal ions present in ground surface waters in the form of metal salts enter the electrolyser the electrolyzed water may contain metal mineral ions due to electrode corrosion or electrode reactions similarly in ionizers metal ions may leach out into the product water as a result of electrolytic reactions and corrosion near the electrodes presence of ionic components of macro elements such as ca na k mg p are essential minerals with health benefits required for human body presence of ca is essential for bone health k and mg are necessary for proper functioning of nervous system and muscle contractions na levels maintain the fluid balance in human body one the other side micro elements such as of fe mn cu se mo cr are essential parts of enzymatic structures they activate antioxidant enzymes and are essential for formation of erythrocyte cells glucose balance etc 38 minerals for the most part exist in water in the represented ionic forms such as ca na k mg cu cu2 fe2 fe3 se2 p3 mn2 ni2 cr3 cr6 pb2 ti3 ti4 al3 cd2 it is noted that except for se and p major part of the ions exist as cations in water and have potential to migrate into cathode chamber containing alkaline ionized water from anode chamber during electrolysis though the consumption of minerals is useful for human body excessive intake may cause harmful effects a list of desirable limits who standard for mineral content in drinking water is provided in table 3a in the present investigation ground water with tds 200 300 mg l was used as feed water in the anode chamber and nanofiltration processed filtered water with tds of 50 100 mg l was used as feed water in the cathode chamber of the ionizer the analysis was carried out using icp oes technique to estimate the presence of elemental ions table 3a shows the elemental analysis of the alkaline ionized water and acidic water produced by the ionizer using ss316 l electrode as both cathode and anode using cmi 7000 membrane till attainment of maximum ph table 3b shows the results for alkaline ionized water produced by the ionizer with titanium anode and ss316 l cathode using different membranes until attainment of maximum ph all the values are provided in mg l initially anode chamber was filled with tap water and cathode chamber was filled with nanofiltration water after operation of ionizer to attain maximum ph in cathode chamber the elemental analysis of alkaline reduced water and acidic water was performed table 3a shows enrichment of macro minerals such as na ca mg k in the alkaline ionized water obtained from cathode chamber the membrane is permeable to the cationic minerals wherein the enrichment of minerals depends upon the initial quantity of minerals present in the ground water taken in anode tank the higher the mineral content in source water the higher the mineral enrichment obtained in alkaline reduced water the only criterion in selection of ground tap water was to see that the water was uncontaminated with toxic metal ions such as arsenic nickel chromium lead cadmium etc which may potentially pass into alkaline reduced water otherwise similarly electrode corrosion also introduces traces of new metal ions into the anode chamber from table 3a it was evident that the use of corrodible ss316 l anode introduced small amounts ionic components into the anode chamber the concentration of fe se mn ni cr pb al content increased in acidic water compared to the concentrations in initial water fed to the anode tank the increase may be attributed to ss316 l anode corrosion the potential risk involved in use of ss316 l as anode was that some of the elements accumulated in the anode chamber from the anode may transfer through the membrane into alkaline ionized water present in cathode chamber and is harmful upon consumption table 3a also shows an increase of trace amounts of cr pb and al in the alkaline water that were not initially present in the feed water thus the use of ss316 l as anode is highly redundant as to avoid addition of harmful elements into either of the ionizer chambers based on the conclusion drawn from section 3 2 titanium electrode was chosen as anode for further studies titanium grade 2 is almost pure titanium with traces of iron carbon nitrogen and hydrogen unlike ss material titanium grade 2 does not possess any harmful metal components such as nickel chromium or aluminum table 3b represents the elemental analysis of the alkaline reduced water obtained by using titanium electrode as anode and ss316 l as cathode it is also essential to assess the performance of different membranes to observe their role in ionic transfer between electrode chambers the experiments were performed with pes peg pes pva ultrafiltration membranes and spes pvc cmi 7000 cation exchange membranes table 3b indicates the enrichment of essential macro minerals such as ca na k mg and fe in alkaline ionized water the potential drive between the electrodes drives the positively charged cations present in tap water from anode chamber towards cathode the cation exchange membranes possess strong negatively charged sulfonated groups attached to the polymeric back bone that offer affinity for permeation of cations from anode chamber to cathode chamber ultrafiltration membranes synthesized from pes also consist of sulfonated groups where as pva and peg polymers hold hydroxyl groups on to the polymeric structure that are negatively charged attract the cations and allow their permeation from anode to cathode chamber however presence of cationic minerals in excess amounts is also not desirable elemental analysis shows the ionic content well within the desirable levels using the above mentioned membranes though non corroding electrode was chosen as anode there still exists a possibility for presence of non desirable cations in anode chamber feed water the observations show that cmi 7000 membrane was more permeable to cations followed by pes membrane cost effectiveness and high flux as priorities pes ultrafiltration membrane may be preferred over the cation exchange membrane 3 4 antioxidant activity of alkaline ionized water antioxidants are the molecules that inhibit the oxidation process and damage the free radicals present in living organisms the presence of antioxidants in alkaline ionized water makes the water healthy for consumption boosts the immune system and destroys free radicals dpph is a stable free radical that readily accepts free electrons from antioxidants to test the anti oxidative reactivity of alkaline ionized water dpph scavenging activity by alkaline ionized water was measured by uv spectrophotometric technique anti oxidant activity was also measured in terms of orp negative orp of alkaline ionized water is a sign of its anti oxidative nature that indicates the presence of free electrons in water that are available to contribute electron to an unpaired electron of the free radical this phenomenon reduces the free radical reactivity in human body and leads to termination of disease causing chain reactions of free radicals the alkaline ionized water samples of varying ph obtained by using pes membrane aided ionizer with ti and ss316 l electrodes were considered for the study from fig 19 the dpph radical scavenging activity was found to range from 7 38 to 48 56 with increasing ph of alkaline ionized water from 7 5 to 9 82 similarly the orp of the corresponding samples varied from 34 to 250 mv the presence of scavenging activity and negative orp levels reveal the anti oxidative nature of alkaline ionized water increase in ph resulted in better scavenging activity and negative orp due to increase in antioxidant hydroxyl ion concentration in alkaline ionized water 3 5 cost estimation 3 5 1 capital cost the list of equipment and capital costs required to build the in house batch ionizer is provided in table 4 in which the unit price for storage cans taps electrodes adapters couplers and membrane were included the assembling and service facility cost components along with 10 overheads were also included the capital cost of the alkaline water ionizer accounts to inr 1138 i e 16 21 us as per the indian market prices 3 5 2 operating cost the operating cost for production of alkaline water ionizer includes costs for consumption of electricity water consumption and filtration costs of feed water as shown in table 5 the operating cost incurred for production of one liter of alkaline ionized water accounts to inr0 655 i e us 0 009 4 conclusions in the present investigation the concept of production of alkaline ionized water by electrolysis without chemical additives was established a cost effective indigenous batch device of 20 l capacity was constructed with widely available components use of titanium anode for electrolysis was found to be non corrosive compared to ss304 ss316 l plasma nitrided ss316 l and graphite electrodes the use of pes based ultrafiltration membrane was found to aid faster electrolysis cost effective and durable that produces mineral and antioxidant enriched alkaline ionized water compared to the ionizer performance with cation exchange membranes or with no membranes the elemental analysis of alkaline water shows enrichment of cationic minerals such as ca na mg and k where as many other elements were found to be within the desirable limit of drinking water the water tests on dpph radical scavenging activity indicate the presence of antioxidant activity where as orp was found to vary from 115 mv to 250 mv for ph variation of alkaline ionized water from 8 5 to 9 8 the capital cost of the indigenous ionizer accounted for just 18 74 us and the operating cost for production of 9 5 ph alkaline ionized water was only 0 011 us per liter the two compartment ionizer device

though sodium bicarbonate dosed water is alkaline in nature with potential health benefits its regular intake was found to cause metabolic alkalosis gastrointestinal distress and sometimes even edema due to excess sodium 4 on the other hand alkaline ionized water is natural chemical free and was not found to cause any side effects even upon daily consumption use of ion exchange membranes or resins

coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the minerals and metals present in alkaline ionized water were analyzed by using icp oes model varian 725 es 2 4 experimental 2 4 1 construction of batch ionizer a batch ionizer device was designed and developed in house for production of alkaline ionized water the device consists of two hdpe tanks of 20 l capacity that were interconnected with slots for incorporation of a flat sheet membrane and electrodes these slots were fitted with nylon pipes supported with rubber o rings and tightened with ss clamps to build a complete leak proof system the ionizer was designed flexible for manual replacement of any flat sheet membrane the positive and negative terminals of a dc adapter were connected to the electrodes using silicone sealant glue and immersed in each of the hdpe tanks the tanks were filled with water in equal proportions wherein the metal plates function as anode and cathode upon power supply the tank with cathode is cathode chamber where as the one with anode is anode chamber the membrane was incorporated between the tanks to prevent the intermixing of water from one tank to the other pvc taps were provided at the bottom of the tanks for collection of water 2 4 2 experimental procedure the membrane was incorporated between anode and cathode chambers along with supporting spacers by adjusting the ss clamp the anode and cathode chambers were filled simultaneously with ground water and nanofiltration potable water respectively to avoid mixing due to hydrostatic pressure difference between the two chambers before starting the experiment tds and ph of drinking water present in the cathode chamber ranges from 50 150 mg l and 6 5 7 respectively where as that in the anode chamber ranges from 250 300 mg l and 7 8 respectively the power supply to the electrodes was switched on and the water samples from both the chambers were measured for ph and tds at regular intervals of time electrolysis of water causes an increase in water ph in cathode chamber and decrease in ph in anode chamber the power supply is ceased until ph becomes constant or 10 fig 1 shows the overall process flow diagram for production of alkaline water from a ground surface water resource 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 corrosion rate the corrosion rate of the electrode was measured by using weight loss analysis method given by eq 1 1 c r w l k a t e where cr is the corrosion rate in mils per year mpy wl is the weight loss of the electrode g k is the k factor as per the units of area considered is the alloy density g cm3 a is the exposed area cm2 and te is the time of exposure h 2 5 2 dpph scavenging method dpph is 1 1 diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl a stable free radical widely used to determine the antioxidant capacity by spectrophotometric method the antioxidant activity of alkaline ionized water samples was measured by dpph radical scavenging method wherein the samples of varying concentrations were prepared in methanol 26 l ascorbic acid was used as standard about 3 5 ml of dpph 0 06 mm in methanol was added to each of the sample solutions 0 1 ml and thoroughly mixed the absorbance measurements were performed using a uv vis double beam spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer shelton ct at 515 nm the decrease in the absorbance was recorded given 30 min incubation against methanol without dpph as the blank reference all experiments were performed in triplet at room temperature absorbance was converted to the dpph radical scavenging rate according to the eq 2 2 d p p h r a d i c a l s c a v e n g i n g r a t e a c o n t r o l a s a m p l e a c o n t r o l 100 where acontrol and asample were the absorbance of control and sample respectively 2 5 3 working mechanism of alkaline ionizer the device works on the principle of water electrolysis the anode chamber and cathode chamber were filled with mineral enriched ground water and potable water purified by nanofiltration simultaneously upon switching on the power supply to the ionizer device electric potential difference occurs across the electrodes where in oxidation and reduction reactions occur at anode and cathode respectively as shown below the oxidation reactions that occur near anode generate h ion and oh ions the oh ions loose electrons to positively charged anode to produce o2 which leads to increase of h ion concentration in the anode chamber thus the water ph in anode chamber gradually decreases the mechanism for generation of alkaline and acidic water is shown in fig 2 the reduction reactions near the cathode generate h ions and oh ions the h ions take up the electrons from negatively charged cathode to produce h2 and active hydrogen that results in accumulation of oh ions in the cathode chamber these ions cause alkalinity to the reduced water in cathode chamber the h2 and active hydrogen evolved near the cathode partially dissolve in alkaline water oxidation at anode 4h2o 4e 4oh 4h 4e 4oh o2 2h2o 4e 2h2o o2 4h 4e overall reaction reduction at cathode 2h2o 2e 2oh 2h 2e 2h 2e h2 2h 2e 2h active hydrogen 2h2o 2e h2 2oh overall reaction under the influence of electric potential difference across the electrodes the cationic minerals present in the anode chamber move towards the cathode selectively through cation selective membrane thus the reduced alkaline water in cathode chamber is enriched with essential minerals which further enhance the production of hydroxyl ions and hydrogen in alkaline water increasing the ph of alkaline water even more 2 6 membrane synthesis membrane plays a vital role in development of water ionizer for production of alkaline water membrane acts as a diaphragm to separate anode and cathode chamber and helps to avoid direct intermixing of fluid levels in both the chambers moreover the selective permeability of membrane allows transfer of cationic minerals from anode chamber to cathode chamber facilitating the enrichment of essential minerals such sodium calcium magnesium potassium and iron in alkaline water this phenomenon increases the electrolysis process efficiency membrane is also essential to curb the mix up of gases released near the electrodes for suppose mix up of chlorine gas released near the anode into alkaline water in cathode chamber which otherwise would impart oxidizing nature to the water and make it unfit for drinking in the present investigation polymer based ultrafiltration membranes and cation exchange membranes were indigenously synthesized and characterized for application in water electrolysis pes pes pva peg based ultrafiltration membranes and spes pvc blend cation exchange membranes were synthesized for this purpose commercial cmi 7000 cation exchange membrane and polyurethane foam barriers were also used to enable comparative studies on electrolysis performance 2 6 1 pes membrane synthesis polyethersulfone offers high durability and mechanical strength to prepare the membrane 23 w v of polyethersulfone pes was mixed with 3 propionic acid in dimethyl formamide dmf solvent the resultant polymer solution is allowed to de aerate such that the polymer solution is bubble free the pes polymer solution is cast on a nonwoven polyester fabric support using an automatic casting machine to achieve the desired thickness the casted membrane is immediately immersed in an ice cold water bath for phase inversion thus obtained membrane is ultraporous in nature with a mwco of 5 kda 2 6 2 pes pva peg membrane synthesis ultraporous pes pva peg blend membrane was synthesized by phase inversion technique a solvent mixture was prepared by dissolving 1 33 w w ethanol in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp polymers measuring 13 75 pes 12 9 pva 4 52 peg were gradually added for dissolution in the nmp solvent mixture by continuous stirring and heating at 60 c for 5 h thus obtained homogenous polymer solution was casted on a glass plate using an automatic casting machine the glass plate along with the casted polymer solution was immediately transferred to a water immersion bath for phase inversion the water molecules replace the solvent molecules to form an ultraporous membrane the pva blending imparts high hydrophilic properties and mechanical strength to the membrane whereas peg blending enhances the anti fouling properties of the membrane addition of volatile ethanol solvent increases the porosity and pore size of the membrane 2 6 3 spes pvc ion exchange membrane synthesis nonporous dense ion exchange membrane is synthesized by blending pes and polyvinyl chloride pvc initially pes was sulfonated by dissolution of 15 pes in concentrated sulphuric acid the sulfonated polymer was precipitated in a cold water bath and water washed to attain neutral ph the obtained sulfonated polyethersulfone spes polymer was dried and 15 spes was dissolved in nmp similarly 12 pvc was also dissolved in nmp spes pvc blend was prepared by mixing equal proportions of both the polymer solutions to attain a homogenous bubble free solution the blend solution was then poured into a petri dish and kept at 40 50 c to attain dense membrane by solvent evaporation the blending technique imparts mechanic strength to the membrane and controls the extent of membrane swelling 3 results discussion the basic design and principle of alkaline ionizer were explored in the present study to produce potable alkaline ionized water various electrode materials and membrane techniques were investigated in the process of development of the proposed low cost ionizer as they prominently affect the quality of water and economics of electrolysis in the present study the performance of the ionizer was evaluated for anti corrosive properties of the electrodes and mineral enrichment capability of membrane to achieve maximum alkalinity all the experiments were conducted at least for three times and the average of the resulting value was reported the maximum error value was observed to be 0 02 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 pes membrane characterization 3 1 1 1 sem of pes membrane figs 3 and 4 show the sem images of surface and cross section of the membrane the surface is uniform and porous with no agglomerations that indicate proper miscibility of polymer in the solvent the cross sectional sem image also shows even distribution of polymer on the non woven

cs vibration peaks appeared at 1488 cm 1 27 the ch stretching peaks of benzene ring were observed at 2909 cm 1 the peaks in range of 3000 to 3600 cm 1 attribute to hydroxyl group stretching 28 the coc bond characteristic peaks were visible at 1050 cm 1 the aromatic cc bending characteristic peaks appeared at 1633 cm 1 3 1 1 3 xrd of pes membrane the xrd of pes membrane seen in fig 6 exhibits that the membrane is neither crystalline nor amorphous the membrane is found to be semi crystalline and found aptly suitable for the purpose of study 3 1 2 pes pva peg membrane characterization 3 1 2 1 sem of pes pva peg membrane figs 7 and 8 represent the sem images of surface and cross sectional morphologies of pes pva peg membrane the sem image of pes pva peg membrane shows highly porous surface compared to pes membrane probably due to the use of highly volatile ethanol solvent for its synthesis the cross sectional morphology depicts uniform distribution of polymer blend layer on the support fabric 3 1 2 2 ftir of pes pva peg membrane fig 9 shows the ftir image of pes pva peg membrane the coc groups of peg were observed at 1122 cm 1 the ch group appears at 2844 cm 1 29 the oh hydroxyl

in fig 10 depicts two wide peaks that indicate the semi crystalline nature of the membrane though the membrane is more crystalline in nature compared to the pes membrane 3 1 3 spes pvc ion exchange membrane characterization 3 1 3 1 sem of spes pvc ion exchange membrane sem image of the spes pvc blend membrane is shown in fig 11 reveals that the surface of the membrane is rough small sized lumps are observed on the surface morphology of the dense membrane due to insufficient miscibility of polyvinylchloride with sulfonated polyethersulfone 3 1 3 2 ftir of spes pvc ion exchange membrane fig 12 shows ftir graph of spes pvc membrane the peaks at 1577 cm 1 and 1484 cm 1 acknowledge the vibration of aromatic ring skeleton the peak at 1011 cm 1 shows the increase of degree of sulfonation which reveals the presence of aromatic so3h symmetric stretching vibration 31 the ftir spectroscopy also shows another distinct peak at 3420 cm 1 which is associated with the stretching of the hydroxyls of sulfonic acid groups 32 33 these results confirm the insertion of sulfonic acid groups onto the polymer backbone the c cl stretching region is observed in the range from 600 700 cm 1 cc stretching in the range of 900 1200 cm 1 and pvc numerous ch modes in 1250 2970 cm 1 range 34 ch bond stretching is observed at 2922 cm 1 ch2 groups deformation at 1309 cm 1 and ccl bond stretching at 871 cm 1 both spectra were very similar to that for pure pvc but revealed characteristic peaks for the polymer bands at 3447 cm 1 corresponding to the angular deformation of oh groups at 2922 cm 1 due to ccc and hch angular deformation 35 3 1 3 3 xrd of spes pvc ion exchange membrane the xrd patterns of plain and sulfonated membranes were shown in fig 13 which consistently follow bragg s law correlation of nλ 2dsinθ in which λ is wavelength n is an integer d represents planar spacing and θ is the angle spes and pvc blend membrane exhibited flat xrd patterns that indicate amorphous nature of the dense polymeric blend membrane 3 2 selection of electrodes electrode material plays a vital role in electrolysis most of capital investment in construction of ionizer is incurred for electrode material use of durable and safe electrode materials is highly crucial for sustainable operation and maintenance of an ionizer stainless steel is one of the most predominantly used low cost electrode materials but its use for alkaline electrolysis is very limited in the present study firstly washers made of ss316 l and ss304 materials were used as electrodes for ionizer batch operations of electrolysis were conducted in the ionizer for 23 h and the observations reveal that the ph of water in cathode chamber of ionizer increased from 7 to 9 5 where as orp varied from 200 mv to 150 mv at the same time the color of anode was observed to be brownish imparting some of its color to the water present in anode chamber the color change of the electrode was associated with weight loss of the electrode and may be attributed to anode corrosion due to oxidation reactions as shown in fig 14 a and b the corrosion rate for ss316 l and ss304 electrodes calculated by weight loss method was estimated to be 3189531 895 14 mpy and 23 275 62 mpy respectively to overcome anode corrosion ss316 l electrode was subjected to surface modification by using a thermo chemical technique named plasma nitridation that transforms the metallic surface into compound layers with high wear resistance due to the diffusion of ionic nitrogen 36 as shown in fig 14 c the experimental observations of electrolysis with nitrided ss316 l electrode as anode also exhibited corrosion where in the compound layers of modified surface were shredded out and the electrode was corroded as shown in fig 14 d further cost effective graphite material was used as anode in the ionizer and the electrolysis performance was studied despite the good electrical conducting properties the surface of graphite anode decomposed as shown in fig 15 though graphite electrode shows little deterioration compared to plasma nitrided ss316 l anode higher rate of increase in alkalinity were observed with the later one compared to that of graphite although the electrode materials ss304 ss316 l graphite have shown good electrolysis performance the durability of anode and sustainability of the device developed were uncertain titanium material is extensively used as anode in several applications due to good electrochemical properties high corrosion resistance and high thermal stability moreover titanium material can also perform superiorly even in acidic environments organic solvents and over voltage conditions titanium anode was also proven to be a better alternative for graphite electrode 37 thus titanium electrode though a little more cost intensive compared to afore mentioned materials was chosen for use as anode in electrolysis for production of alkaline reduced water fig 16 shows the comparative electrolysis performance of titanium anodes with other anode materials where as ss316 l was commonly used as cathode in all the experimental trials unlike anode usage of ss316 l as cathode material did not result in corrosion alteration of the electrode use of titanium as anode and ss316 l as cathode in electrolysis for production of alkaline ionized water resulted in high rate of increase in alkalinity moreover no weight loss or color change of the electrode was observed the electrode performance did not alter much even after its continuous usage for more than six months 3 3 selection of membrane electrolysis process occurs whenever a direct current is supplied to cathode and anode placed in an electrolytic medium a membrane is often not required for the process to occur though its application may have several added advantages membrane acts as a diaphragm when placed between anode and cathode chambers by prevention of free bulk water and electrode gas mixing while allowing selective permeation of ions between the two chambers thus membrane plays a crucial role in maintaining and enhancing the product water quality in electrode chambers in the present study several membranes of flat sheet configuration were synthesized to suite the design of the water ionizer device a porous polyurethane foam sponge in house synthesized pes based high flux ultraporous membranes pes and pes pva peg spes pvc blend cation exchange membrane and a commercial cation exchange membrane cmi 7000 were used in the study to evaluate the performance of water ionizer all the valuation studies were conducted using the in house designed ionizer as mentioned in section 2 construction of batch ionizer that uses a 36 v dc adapter ss316 l electrode as cathode and titanium electrode as anode the surface area of electrode and membrane used were 15 32 cm2 and 38 5 cm2 respectively the ionizer is operated till the water in cathode chamber has attained maximum alkalinity with constant ph profile the variations in total dissolved solids tds ph and orp were recorded with operating time to evaluate the membrane performance in the ionizer the electrolysis performance using different type of membranes of ionizer to attain a ph around 9 was shown in table 2 it was observed that the performance of pes ultrafiltration membrane was better compared to spes pvc and commercial cmi 7000 ion exchange membranes till attainment of 9 ph in cathode chamber where in the fluxes were recorded as 1 4 1 17 and 1 42 l h 1 respectively the observations reveal that the performance of ionizer with pes and cmi 7000 membranes results in better flux and orp compared to other membranes though use of pes pva peg membrane resulted in better orp 250 mv and maximum ph 9 97 the flux attained was observed to be low 1 33 l h 1 to understand water mixing and ion exchange between fluids present in electrode chambers of the ionizer the electrolysis performance was observed without the use of any membrane the variations in tds profile of the water in anode and cathode tanks were observed over a period of operating time as shown in fig 17 the observations reveal that without the use of membrane tds of alkaline water increased rapidly from 75 to 272 mg l within one hour of electrolysis operation whereas with use of a membrane separating the electrode tanks the tds profile was observed as nearly constant though the electrolysis performance is merely the same with or without the use of membrane the quality of water in cathode tank degrades due to intermixing of hardness causing salts gases or microbes from anode tank thus obtained alkaline water may not be suitable for drinking purpose incorporation of membrane between the electrode tanks however leads to slight elevation in tds of alkaline water upto 20 mg l due to enrichment of cationic minerals in comparison to the performance of ionizer without any membrane the performance of foam sponge was better with a flux of 1 22 l h electrolysis without membrane lead to higher increase of ph till 9 84 but on the other hand tds of water in the cathode tank has increased from 90 to 300 mg l from very initial readings this is an indication for intermixing of water in both anode and cathode chambers the resultant water was alkaline but may not be suitable for drinking purpose as the salts contributing to hardness and gases from anode chamber easily seep into cathode chamber with incorporation of membrane into the electrolyser no increase in tds of water 20 mg l was seen in both the electrode chambers fig 17 shows the tds levels in both cathode and anode without use of membrane and with use of pes membrane for production of alkaline ionized water a comparative performance of ionizer with use of different membranes is well understood from fig 18 the graph shows increase in ph of water in cathode chamber with operating time pes membrane was observed to be a better barrier for increase in ph of water from 8 to 9 where as cem 7000 exhibited better performance for higher ph range of 9 5 10 owing to the high cost of the imported ion exchange membranes pes membrane may be considered as the ideal membrane for development of an indigenous cost effective ionizer nevertheless it is also necessary to check the water quality for elemental analysis to ensure its compatibility for potable application 3 3 1 elemental analysis of water ground surface water and filtered water were used as feed to the anode chamber of the electrolyser the metal ions present in ground surface waters in the form of metal salts enter the electrolyser the electrolyzed water may contain metal mineral ions due to electrode corrosion or electrode reactions similarly in ionizers metal ions may leach out into the product water as a result of electrolytic reactions and corrosion near the electrodes presence of ionic components of macro elements such as ca na k mg p are essential minerals with health benefits required for human body presence of ca is essential for bone health k and mg are necessary for proper functioning of nervous system and muscle contractions na levels maintain the fluid balance in human body one the other side micro elements such as of fe mn cu se mo cr are essential parts of enzymatic structures they activate antioxidant enzymes and are essential for formation of erythrocyte cells glucose balance etc 38 minerals for the most part exist in water in the represented ionic forms such as ca na k mg cu cu2 fe2 fe3 se2 p3 mn2 ni2 cr3 cr6 pb2 ti3 ti4 al3 cd2 it is noted that except for se and p major part of the ions exist as cations in water and have potential to migrate into cathode chamber containing alkaline ionized water from anode chamber during electrolysis though the consumption of minerals is useful for human body excessive intake may cause harmful effects a list of desirable limits who standard for mineral content in drinking water is provided in table 3a in the present investigation ground water with tds 200 300 mg l was used as feed water in the anode chamber and nanofiltration processed filtered water with tds of 50 100 mg l was used as feed water in the cathode chamber of the ionizer the analysis was carried out using icp oes technique to estimate the presence of elemental ions table 3a shows the elemental analysis of the alkaline ionized water and acidic water produced by the ionizer using ss316 l electrode as both cathode and anode using cmi 7000 membrane till attainment of maximum ph table 3b shows the results for alkaline ionized water produced by the ionizer with titanium anode and ss316 l cathode using different membranes until attainment of maximum ph all the values are provided in mg l initially anode chamber was filled with tap water and cathode chamber was filled with nanofiltration water after operation of ionizer to attain maximum ph in cathode chamber the elemental analysis of alkaline reduced water and acidic water was performed table 3a shows enrichment of macro minerals such as na ca mg k in the alkaline ionized water obtained from cathode chamber the membrane is permeable to the cationic minerals wherein the enrichment of minerals depends upon the initial quantity of minerals present in the ground water taken in anode tank the higher the mineral content in source water the higher the mineral enrichment obtained in alkaline reduced water the only criterion in selection of ground tap water was to see that the water was uncontaminated with toxic metal ions such as arsenic nickel chromium lead cadmium etc which may potentially pass into alkaline reduced water otherwise similarly electrode corrosion also introduces traces of new metal ions into the anode chamber from table 3a it was evident that the use of corrodible ss316 l anode introduced small amounts ionic components into the anode chamber the concentration of fe se mn ni cr pb al content increased in acidic water compared to the concentrations in initial water fed to the anode tank the increase may be attributed to ss316 l anode corrosion the potential risk involved in use of ss316 l as anode was that some of the elements accumulated in the anode chamber from the anode may transfer through the membrane into alkaline ionized water present in cathode chamber and is harmful upon consumption table 3a also shows an increase of trace amounts of cr pb and al in the alkaline water that were not initially present in the feed water thus the use of ss316 l as anode is highly redundant as to avoid addition of harmful elements into either of the ionizer chambers based on the conclusion drawn from section 3 2 titanium electrode was chosen as anode for further studies titanium grade 2 is almost pure titanium with traces of iron carbon nitrogen and hydrogen unlike ss material titanium grade 2 does not possess any harmful metal components such as nickel chromium or aluminum table 3b represents the elemental analysis of the alkaline reduced water obtained by using titanium electrode as anode and ss316 l as cathode it is also essential to assess the performance of different membranes to observe their role in ionic transfer between electrode chambers the experiments were performed with pes peg pes pva ultrafiltration membranes and spes pvc cmi 7000 cation exchange membranes table 3b indicates the enrichment of essential macro minerals such as ca na k mg and fe in alkaline ionized water the potential drive between the electrodes drives the positively charged cations present in tap water from anode chamber towards cathode the cation exchange membranes possess strong negatively charged sulfonated groups attached to the polymeric back bone that offer affinity for permeation of cations from anode chamber to cathode chamber ultrafiltration membranes synthesized from pes also consist of sulfonated groups where as pva and peg polymers hold hydroxyl groups on to the polymeric structure that are negatively charged attract the cations and allow their permeation from anode to cathode chamber however presence of cationic minerals in excess amounts is also not desirable elemental analysis shows the ionic content well within the desirable levels using the above mentioned membranes though non corroding electrode was chosen as anode there still exists a possibility for presence of non desirable cations in anode chamber feed water the observations show that cmi 7000 membrane was more permeable to cations followed by pes membrane cost effectiveness and high flux as priorities pes ultrafiltration membrane may be preferred over the cation exchange membrane 3 4 antioxidant activity of alkaline ionized water antioxidants are the molecules that inhibit the oxidation process and damage the free radicals present in living organisms the presence of antioxidants in alkaline ionized water makes the water healthy for consumption boosts the immune system and destroys free radicals dpph is a stable free radical that readily accepts free electrons from antioxidants to test the anti oxidative reactivity of alkaline ionized water dpph scavenging activity by alkaline ionized water was measured by uv spectrophotometric technique anti oxidant activity was also measured in terms of orp negative orp of alkaline ionized water is a sign of its anti oxidative nature that indicates the presence of free electrons in water that are available to contribute electron to an unpaired electron of the free radical this phenomenon reduces the free radical reactivity in human body and leads to termination of disease causing chain reactions of free radicals the alkaline ionized water samples of varying ph obtained by using pes membrane aided ionizer with ti and ss316 l electrodes were considered for the study from fig 19 the dpph radical scavenging activity was found to range from 7 38 to 48 56 with increasing ph of alkaline ionized water from 7 5 to 9 82 similarly the orp of the corresponding samples varied from 34 to 250 mv the presence of scavenging activity and negative orp levels reveal the anti oxidative nature of alkaline ionized water increase in ph resulted in better scavenging activity and negative orp due to increase in antioxidant hydroxyl ion concentration in alkaline ionized water 3 5 cost estimation 3 5 1 capital cost the list of equipment and capital costs required to build the in house batch ionizer is provided in table 4 in which the unit price for storage cans taps electrodes adapters couplers and membrane were included the assembling and service facility cost components along with 10 overheads were also included the capital cost of the alkaline water ionizer accounts to inr 1138 i e 16 21 us as per the indian market prices 3 5 2 operating cost the operating cost for production of alkaline water ionizer includes costs for consumption of electricity water consumption and filtration costs of feed water as shown in table 5 the operating cost incurred for production of one liter of alkaline ionized water accounts to inr0 655 i e us 0 009 4 conclusions in the present investigation the concept of production of alkaline ionized water by electrolysis without chemical additives was established a cost effective indigenous batch device of 20 l capacity was constructed with widely available components use of titanium anode for electrolysis was found to be non corrosive compared to ss304 ss316 l plasma nitrided ss316 l and graphite electrodes the use of pes based ultrafiltration membrane was found to aid faster electrolysis

14266,acidic low concentration copper containing wastewater is technically a type of refractory wastewater in this study a tio2 photocatalyst was used to photo deposit cu ii from a cu containing dilution to produce a usable cu 0 tio2 composite byproduct which could be used as a catalyst for a reverse water gas shift reaction rwgs reaction a photocatalyst for a cr vi photo reduction and a crystal nucleus for chemical plating the photo deposition process of cu ii with tio2 500 under uv light was found to be divided into three stages an initial stage for acceleration through sensitization a middle stage for a constant rate and a final stage for deceleration through the slow mass transfer of the diluted cu ii after treating the wastewater to the discharge standard only cu 0 was observed on the tio2 surface which can be employed as a valuable byproduct the rwgs reaction can be effectively catalyzed by the cu 0 tio2 500 with a 26 78 co2 conversion and 100 co selectivity at a temperature of under 600 c the photocatalytic performance of tio2 500 is enhanced with the deposited cu shortening the time required to photo reduce the cr vi pollutants ni cu nanoparticles are also prepared from the sensitization effect of the deposited cu forming a bimetallic site as a possible catalyst this study demonstrated a promising economic process for environmental protection and waste recycling keywords cu containing wastewater three stage photoreduction recycling byproduct cu 0 tio2 catalyst 1 introduction acidic copper containing wastewater is a heavy metal pollutant which originates from various industries including chemical electroplating non ferrous metal smelting electronic materials paper and other industries 1 4 however the discharge of cu containing wastewater must obey a severe standard namely a 0 5 mg l allowable emission concentration of copper according to china s wastewater discharge standard gb8978 1996 the removal of cu from wastewater for environmental protection is therefore urgently needed 5 7 in acidic copper containing wastewater cu ii mostly exists in a free or complex form with inorganic ligands such as no3 cl so4 2 and h2o 8 9 many technologies including adsorption 10 11 ion exchange 12 14 membrane separation 15 16 and chemical precipitation 1 17 have been developed to achieve this severe standard however such traditional methods are usually imperfect owing to the possible need for secondary treatment of collected cu which has a relatively high cost and energy consumption the direct conversion of abandoned cu in wastewater into a useful product without further treatment is an attractive solution when considering environmental protection and the promotion of its commercial value the photo deposition process has been recently applied to the treatment of copper containing wastewater particularly at a low cu concentration owing to its low cost and being environmentally benign 9 18 19 to remove cu ii copper ions can be effectively reduced by photo generated electrons with a strong reducibility and captured onto the photocatalyst surface 20 tio2 is a common uv light driven photocatalyst that has typically been adopted for this cu ii photo deposition process however there are two problems pertaining to the application of this process the mechanism of cu ii photoreduction by tio2 is unclear as the form of the photo deposited cu species is unknown and there remains the question of whether it is possible to utilize the cu tio2 byproduct for additional economic benefit for the first problem cu 0 and cu ⅰ have both been considered as possible reducing products the existence of cu 0 on tio2 was theoretically analyzed by reiche 21 and confirmed through x ray absorption fine structure xafs spectroscopy 22 23 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 24 25 x ray diffraction xrd 19 and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum uv vis drs 26 however some evidence also indicates the existence of cu i on tio2 after photo deposition through electron paramagnetic resonance epr characterization 27 and in situ ftir spectroscopy of co adsorption 28 it has also been reported that when all cu ii in a solution has been reduced to cu2o the generated cu2o will be further reduced to cu 0 29 the co existence of cu 0 and cu2o after photo deposition has also been observed 30 31 this controversy has caused confusion in understanding the cu ii reduction mechanism with tio2 the second problem is directly related to the economic value of the photoreduction process for wastewater treatment the photo deposited cu obtained must be recovered properly through secondary treatment for recovery and environmental protection however current research into the photo deposition process has mainly focused on the development of a new photocatalyst 19 32 and an evaluation of its photoreduction efficiency 9 18 24 the chemical sludge produced from photo deposition has typically been ignored and rarely reused directly this chemical sludge containing the treated metal after photo deposition can be properly applied in other fields 33 34 therefore if this cu deposited composite byproduct cu tio2 can be directly converted into a usable product without extra cost for secondary treatment it would be economically and technically attractive in promoting the actual application of the photoreduction process in this study the photo deposition process of cu ii under acidic conditions ph 3 with uv light irradiation was investigated the mechanism and kinetic aspect of the cu ii photo deposition process applied to tio2 were deeply explored the various potential application fields of the cu tio2 byproduct obtained were considered based on an understanding of the cu ii photo deposition mechanism for bettering the application value of the photo reduction process 2 experimental 2 1 materials butyl titanate isopropanol ch3 2choh and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab were used

total of 0 4 g of ctab was added to the solution containing 10 ml of butyl titanate and 40 ml of ch3 2choh and the solution was then magnetically stirred for 30 min to dissolve the added ctab next 20 ml of a ch3 2choh solution containing 10 water was dropped into the above solution and stirred continuously for 4 h after the addition was completed the mixture obtained was separated through centrifugation and then dried at 70 for 24 h after washing five times with ultrapure water finally the solid obtained namely tio2 x where x 300 400 500 600 and 700 was calcined at 300 400 500 600 and

100 mg l was prepared using cuso4 5h2o and ultrapure water and the ph value was adjusted to 3 using hno3 the photodegradation experiments were carried out in a photoreactor aulight lab500e4 china with a 50 ml quartz tube and a 500 w mercury lamp under magnetic stirring a 0 06 g tio2 photocatalyst 20 ml cuso4 solution and 1 ml scavenger including hcooh ch3oh c2h5oh ch2oh 2 and c3h7oh were added to the tube for photodegradation the cu concentration of the solution during the photoreaction was monitored using an icp oes thermo scientific icap7400 usa 2 5 utilization of cu 0 tio2 a reverse water gas shift reaction rwgs was carried out in a continuous flow fixed bed reactor a total of 0 1 g of cu 0 tio2 obtained from a cu ii photoreduction or fresh tio2 500 was placed in a quartz tube reactor with a 4 mm diameter the reaction temperature ranged between 300 c and 600 c and the feeding space velocity of the co2 h2 mixture was 36 000 ml h 1 g 1 the tail gas was analyzed using gas

in a 50 ml vessel by adding 0 06 g of cu 0 tio2 into a 20 ml plating solution with a ph of 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 tio2 500 photo deposition process for cu ii removal the photocatalyst used for this study tio2 was home made and screened out based on its adsorption and photoreduction performance for cu ii removal the optimal version tio2 500 possessed an anatase crystal form fig s1 and the narrowest band gap of 3 04 ev fig s2 the photoreduction of cu ii can be completed within 6 min with a removal efficiency of 98 51 using the as prepared tio2 500 fig s3 a thus tio2 500 was determined to be the main objective for successive studies on the mechanics and byproduct utilization usually organic contaminants are involved in acidic cu containing wastewater treatment and are treated as cod inevitably the existence of these impurities will seriously affect the photoreduction fortunately a hole scavenger is necessary in the photoreduction process of cu ii and these organic contaminants can play such a role thus the influence of different typical organics as scavengers in the photoreduction process of cu ii with tio2 500 was investigated as shown in fig 1 a the 30 min dark adsorption of cu ii with tio2 500 was guaranteed to result in an adsorption equilibrium although the real adsorption amount of cu ii can be neglected table s1 with different organic scavenges the complete removal of aqueous cu ii with a final concentration of lower than 0 5 mg l can be achieved using tio2 500 under uv light irradiation however the photo deposition speed used to achieve the cu ii removal differs with hcooh and ch2oh 2 as a hole scavenger cu ii in wastewater can be lowered to 0 48 and 0 41 mg l within 5 min using photo deposition with tio2 500 respectively however when replacing a scavenger with ch3oh c2h5oh and c3h7oh the time consumed to reach the wastewater discharge standard increases to 6 7 and 9 min respectively in addition the effects of light type fig s3 b photoreaction atmosphere fig s3 c and the addition of common cations such as na ca2 and mg2 fig s3 d on the photoreaction process were also explored as shown in fig s3 b cu2 removal efficiency is highest 94 40 under uv light from fig s3 c tio2 500 has the highest cu2 removal efficiency 95 04 under nitrogen protection as shown in fig s3 d the addition of cations reduces the removal efficiency of cu2 and na has the greatest impact on the photo deposition process based on the entire photo deposition process shown in fig 1 a three stages can be applied an initial stage for acceleration a middle stage for a constant rate and a final stage for a deceleration regardless of which scavenger is employed the control step of photo deposition is the diffusion of cu2 and adsorption plays an important role in this process 35 due to the existence of adsorption the current researchs 24 36 on photo deposition of cu2 were consistent with the first order kinetic model and no obvious initial stage was found this is because a large amount of cu2 is present on the surface of the photocatalyst due to adsorption and those cu2 is rapidly reduced to cu0 after the light is turned on which makes the initial stage difficult to be observed the kinetics in these studies are not intrinsic photo deposition of cu2 kinetics due to the effects of adsorption the adsorption of cu2 by tio2 500 used in this paper is negligible so this process demonstrates the true photo deposition of cu2 the initial stage may be explained as the formation phase of cu nuclei deposited on a photocatalyst surface owing to the photoreduction of cu ii these deposited cu nuclei can evoke the schottky effect promoting the separation of a photo generated hole and electron pairs and increasing the quantum efficiency of the photocatalyst with an increase in the amount of deposited cu the photoreduction capacity of photocatalyst should be improved and an acceleration effect appears however the different time consumed for this copper sensitized stage depends on the capacity of the different hole scavengers for capturing photo generated holes the stronger the reducibility is the faster the initial acceleration stage after the initial stage sufficient cu deposits onto the tio2 surface and the speed of generation and consumption of the photo generated carriers reaches a state of equilibrium therefore the middle stage with a constant photoreaction rate is formed a linear decrease in the cu ii concentration can be observed owing to the constant surface photoreaction rate as shown in fig 1 b the correlated kinetic constant of the middle stage with different scavengers through a linear fitting of the cu ii concentration over time were all close to 4 600 mg l min except for formic acid 6 511 mg l min confirming their similar degradation speed the reason why formic acid as hole scavenger has a different kinetic constant is that formic acid directly consumes photogenerated holes while other hole scavengers consume hydroxyl radicals oh 20 in the third stage the reaction rate was controlled through the mass transfer of cu ii ions owing to the extremely dilute solution thus a deceleration stage of cu ii removal is formed 3 2 characterizations of the catalyst before and after photo deposition however the above speculation of the cu ii removal process through a photoreduction should be further investigated for confirmation the existence of cu species on fresh tio2 500 and tio2 500 after a 9 min photoreduction in 20 mg l cu ii with c3h7oh as the scavenger was thus characterized because this process is the slowest providing the greatest information the xrd results in fig 2 confirm that the crystal form of tio2 500 both before and after photoreduction is anatase without any detectable change the diffraction peaks at 25 58 37 80 and 48 05 were assigned to the 101 004 and 200 crystal planes of anatase respectively no observable peaks ascribed to the cu species were detected suggesting the amorphous or high dispersion of cu on the tio2 surface the sem analysis of tio2 500 before and after the photo reaction in fig 3 a and b also exhibited a similar blocky morphonology of the tio2 samples without a significant change the results of the n2 adsorption desorption table s2 showed that the bet surface area of fresh tio2 500 was 42 82 m2 g with mainly mesopores with a diameter of approximately 15 nm fig s4 b after photoreaction the bet surface area of used tio2 500 was 25 60 m2 g table s2 with a diameter of approximately 10 nm fig s4 d the decrease in the bet surface area and pore size is due to copper deposited on the surface of tio2 500 the hrtem results shown in fig 3 c and d reaffirmed that only the crystal plane attributed to anatase tio2 including 101 004 and 200 of a fresh photocatalyst and 101 103 and 105 of a used photocatalyst can be observed the existence of the cu species was still not determined however employing an sem mapping analysis to determine the possible components on the used tio2 sample surface the existence of cu species was ascertained as shown in fig 4 a scattered distribution of cu element was exhibited although its density was significantly sparser than that of ti and o the ratio of ti and o was roughly 1 2 according to the ratio of titania but the cu distribution was significantly less indicating its high dispersion and low content however despite the existence of a cu species on tio2 after photoreduction was ascertained its formation needs to be determined the cu xps analysis shown in fig 5 indicates this problem no signals ascribed to the cu species were found through the xps results of fresh tio2 500 fig 5 a however for the used sample two remarkable peaks at 931 8 ev and 951 5 ev appeared which belong to cu2p3 2 and cu2p1 2 fig 5 b respectively these peaks should be assigned to the peak shift of cu 0 owing to the absence of a satellite peak of cu2p which should be observed if cu2o and cuo are present 37 38 compared with previous studies 39 the shift of the peak value of approximately 1 ev should be attributed to the low energy of cu2p caused by the high dispersion status of cu 0 on tio2 40 41 to further prove that the formation of the photo reduced cu ii was cu 0 the cu lmm xaes spectrum was determined as shown in fig 5 c and d only a peak of ti2s at 565 ev in the fresh sample was observed as indicated in fig 5 c however for the used sample a small signal at 568 0 ev ascribed to cu 0 was detected although it was partially overlapped by the ti2s peak which was totally different from that of cu2o at 569 4 ev and that of cuo at 568 5 ev 42 to exclude the interference of ti2s and further confirm the existence of cu 0 after photoreduction a uv vis drs analysis was conducted as shown in fig 6 a compared to the spectrum of fresh tio2 500 the spectrum of the used sample exhibits a slope peak at 575 nm which was caused by localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of the metallic cu 26 43 44 the adsorption edge increased from 418 9 nm in fresh tio2 500 to 444 4 nm in the used sample indicating a band to band transition of the anatase and a d d transition of the cu 0 45 the relatively strong adsorption of the used sample in the visible light spectrum compared with the fresh sample should be ascribed to an increasing visible light harvesting ability resulting from the lspr of the metallic cu converting the data into αһʋ 2 and һʋ according to the kubelka munk formula 46 47 the band gap of the fresh tio2 500 was 2 96 ev whereas that of the used tio2 500 was 2 79 ev as indicated in fig 6 b therefore the change in absorption edge band gap and absorbance of the catalyst before and after the photo reaction all confirmed the deposition of cu 0 onto tio2 pl testing of tio2 500 before and after photoreduction was carried out as shown in fig 7 the fluorescence intensity of tio2 500 after the photo reaction was significantly reduced indicating a reduction in the recombination rate of the electron hole pairs this reduction should be ascribed to the formation of a heterojunction constructed using tio2 and deposited cu 0 such a junction formed schottky barrier and improved charge transport efficiency generate a sensitization effect and enhance the photocatalytic performance in addition the fluorescence at 400 nm ascribed to the excited tio2 and at 469 nm ascribed to the oxygen vacancies 48 was detected thus the existence of the deposited cu after photo reduction using tio2 was determined to be cu 0 and resulted in an intensification of the photocatalytic performance for the successive photocatalysis processes the following reaction 49 is assumed to usually occur in the photo deposition process of cu ii with tio2 under light irradiation 1 cu2 2e cu eθ 0 337 ev 2 2cu2 h2o 2e cu2o 2h eθ 0 203 ev here cu ii can be reduced using anatase to form cu 0 or cu i according to these equations because the cb of anatase was 0 3 ev and the vb was 2 9 ev 20 however owing to the acidic condition ph 3 and low concentration approximately 0 315 mmol l the standard electrode potential 298 15 k of cu ii cu changed to 0 234 ev according to the nernst equation which was greater than cu ii cu2o 0 173 ev under the same conditions in addition when cu was generated it was unstable and a disproportionation reaction spontaneously occurred to form cu 0 and cu2 according to the following reactions 49 3 cu2 e cu eθ 0 153 ev 4 cu e cu eθ 0 520 ev 5 4 3 2cu cu2 cu e 0 367 ev therefore there is no observable cu i in the solution or on the tio2 during the entire photo deposition process which is in accord with the occurrence during the experiment and the characterization 3 3 process mechanism of photo deposition of cu ii although the light driven deposition of cu ii on tio2 500 was confirmed the occurrence of the three stages during the total photoreduction process should be discussed in detail for further understanding a pre deposited tio2 500 sample was used to mimic the photocatalyst after completing the initial induction stage approximately 0 033 wt of cu 0 according to the cu balance calculation conducted during the previous experiment was photo deposited onto tio2 500 as shown in fig 8 a the pre deposited tio2 500 decreased the 20 mg l cu ii solution to 0 47 mg l in 6 min using c3h7oh as the scavenger whereas the fresh tio2 500 was consumed in 9 min the sensitization stage during the photo deposition process of the pre deposited tio2 500 was eliminated and only a similar middle stage with a constant rate and a decelerate stage could be observed by linearly fitting the cu ii concentration over time during the middle stage it was found that the slopes k of the fresh tio2 500 and pre deposited tio2 500 were 4 413 mg l min and 4 602 mg l min respectively showing that the middle stage with the same constant rate obeyed the zero order dynamic model the occurrence of the cu ii removal rate acceleration during the initial stage is undoubtedly ascribed to the sensitization of the trace amount of cu 0 deposited on the tio2 500 surface which formed a schottky junction with tio2 to promote the separation of the electron hole pairs the pre deposited sample was then analyzed through tem mapping to detect the trace cu element on tio2 500 as shown in fig 8 c a uniformly dispersed signal of cu can be observed although its density is quite low considering the fact that the pre deposited sample was washed adequately and the adsorbed cu species should be cleansed it can be regarded that cu 0 was deposited on the photocatalyst surface forming a schottky junction and sensitizing the tio2 500 to further confirm whether the occurrence of the acceleration stage is independent of the cu ii concentration in a solution an acidic solution was replaced with a 100 mg l cu ii solution with a ph value of 3 after 30 min of adsorption in the dark a photo deposition of cu ii was carried out under uv light using c3h7oh as the scavenger a similar three stage process was found as shown in fig 9 a although the total time consumed was significantly prolongated three stages namely acceleration a constant rate and deceleration were observed the time extension of the initial stage should be ascribed to the high cu ii concentration whereas the kinetics of the cu ii photo deposition process during the three stages was not affected xrd and hrtem analyses of a photo deposited sample from a 100 mg l cu ii solution were conducted to acquire visual evidence of cu deposition as shown in fig 9 b and c because the sample from the 20 mg l solution cannot be observed directly through these two characterization approaches the xrd results in fig 9 b confirmed the existence of metallic cu in the used tio2 500 based on the peaks at 43 30 and 50 43 which were assigned to the 111 and 200 crystal faces of the metallic cu respectively this result also confirms the crystal formation and growth of cu nanoparticles because these peaks are invisible in the xrd results of the samples from the 20 mg l cu ii solution as shown in fig 2 this occurrence is similar to the growth mechanism of the reported pb and cr photo deposition on au nps with tio2 as a photocatalyst 50 it can be deduced that the growth of cu nps should also occur around the formed cu nuclei causing them to enlarge the existence of such large cu nps was also directly reaffirmed through the tem results of the used tio2 500 as fig 9 c shows lattice diffraction fringes of approximately 5 10 nm cu nps on the surface of the used sample from the 100 mg l cu ii solution can be clearly seen which was assigned to the 111 crystal plane of the metallic cu a three stage process of cu ii photoreduction with tio2 500 as a photocatalyst under acidic conditions was proposed and is described in scheme 1 during the initial stage the dissolved cu ii was adsorbed and photo reduced into cu 0 and deposited onto the active site of the tio2 surface forming tiny cu 0 nuclei which are difficult to detect however such tiny nuclei still can construct a schottky junction with tio2 to intensify the photoactivity theoretically when the work function of the metal is greater than the work function of the n type semiconductor their close contact can form schottky junction which can effectively prevent the reverse transfer of photogenerated electrons trapped by metal 51 52 the work function of tio2 and metallic cu are 4 12 ev and 4 97 ev respectively 53 therefore schottky junction can form at the interface between cu0 and tio2 with the increase in the deposited cu the photocatalytic performance of tio2 continued to be enhanced causing an acceleration effect until almost all active sites were covered by the cu 0 nuclei and the photoreaction reached the maximum speed the photo deposition process then entered the second stage with a constant speed owing to the deposited cu 0 nuclei the photo generated electrons by tio2 were enriched on the cu surface attracting the cu ii ions and inducing a successive photoreduction the cu 0 nuclei in this stage grew and formed cu 0 nps this stage was determined based on the intrinsic photoreaction rate and caused a relative steady linear photodegradation speed against the cu ii concentration with a further decrease in the cu ii content in the solution the apparent photoreaction rate slowed owing to the slow diffusion of cu ii ions in extremely diluted solutions most of the cu ii ions were deposited as cu 0 nps and the photoreaction was controlled through the mass transfer of residual aqueous cu ii ions the photoreduction process entered the third deceleration stage and the cu ii concentration remaining in the water met the requested concentration for discharge namely 0 5 mg l 3 4 application of byproducts for wastewater treatment the removal of contaminants and the reuse of resources are both important from an economic perspective however during this process although cu ii is removed from water the cu containing sludge byproduct has not been further utilized as of yet causing possible secondary pollution and increasing the treatment cost it is therefore necessary to determine the usability of the cu deposited tio2 byproduct a copper based catalyst has been widely developed in many fields such as the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons 54 55 hydrogenation 55 57 and dehydrogenation 58 60 the cu 0 tio2 byproduct possessed lots of cu nps deposited on surface with high dispersion and can be applied as a catalyst without a successive pre treatment the loaded cu species exhibit a schottky barrier effect enhancing the photocatalytic performance of the tio2 25 61 62 thus cu 0 tio2 also has potential as a highly efficient photocatalyst based on its sensitization effect in addition cu 0 is usually employed as a seed for chemical plating owing to its autocatalytic activity cu 0 tio2 can be regarded as particles with a sensitized cu seed therefore three possible applications namely an rwgs reaction with cu 0 tio2 as a catalyst cr vi removal of wastewater with cu 0 tio2 as a photocatalyst and nickel electroless plating with cu 0 tio2 as a sensitized seed have been attempted to determine the application potential of a cu 0 tio2 byproduct from the cu ii treatment process three samples fresh tio2 500 and used tio2 500 from 20 and 100 mg l of cu containing wastewater were applied for an rwgs reaction and their cu contents were 0 wt 0 66 wt and 3 33 wt respectively as shown in fig 10 a the catalytic performance of pure tio2 500 for an rwgs reaction can be neglected however the plots in fig 10 b and c confirm that the 0 66 wt and 3 33 wt cu 0 tio2 500 byproducts can both effectively catalyze the conversion of co2 into co with an increase in temperature the co2 conversion catalyzed using 0 66 wt and 3 33 wt cu 0 tio2 500 increased from 0 28 and 0 57 at 300 c to 26 57 and 26 78 at 600 c respectively the co selectivity of both reached 100 within the entire temperature region the turnover frequency tof of the two byproducts were calculated based on the loaded cu mass because the cu content of the 0 66 wt sample was too low to be detected using h2 tpr fig s5 at 600 c a tof value of the 0 66 wt sample reached as high as 29 59 mol gcu h which is much larger than the 5 90 mol gcu h of the sample with 3 33 wt cu content the five fold increase in value of the mass based tof is inverse proportional to the mass increase in the deposited cu this result suggests that the increase in loaded cu content did not increase the amount of the active site because the two co2 conversion plots almost overlapped the effective surface of the cu nps for catalyzation had mostly not increased indirectly indicating that the volume largening of the cu nps and not their quantity occurred at the constant speed of cu ii during the photoreduction process this result confirms that the cu 0 tio2 500 byproduct is an effective catalyst candidate for an rwgs reaction the fresh and used tio2 500 samples were also used as photocatalysts to remove cr vi from water under uv light as shown in fig 10 d the total cr content in the solution was treated from 50 to 1 48 mg l within 120 min by cu 0 tio2 500 with c3h7oh as the scavenger which is lower than the requested value of 1 5 mg l based on the chinese wastewater discharging standard gb 8978 1996 however for the fresh tio2 the total cr content after 120 min was 5 47 mg l and it was difficult to achieve a further decrease to the standard even when the time was extended to more than 160 min 3 59 mg l this result confirms that cu 0 tio2 500 achieved a better photocatalytic performance than the anatase and can be applied as a photocatalyst for waste water treatment the feasibility of using cu 0 tio2 500 as a sensitized seed to initiate electroless nickel plating was confirmed and the sem and sem mapping results of cu 0 tio2 500 and cu 0 tio2 500 after nickel plating are shown in fig 11 compared with cu 0 tio2 500 in fig 11 a the plated sample in fig 11 b exhibited many small spherical nanoparticles deposited on the surface the sem mapping analysis results shown in fig 11 c e exhibit the co existence of ni and cu elements with a uniform dispersion all of which were localized at the site of small spherical nanoparticles the amount of ni was more than that of cu but their distributions almost overlapped this occurrence confirms the sensitization effect of cu in the cu 0 tio2 500 induced ni deposition further ni growth occurred with the cu site as the nuclei formed a spherical shape creating a bimetallic site for possible application as a catalyst this result also confirms the sensitization effect of cu in cu 0 tio2 500 demonstrating its possible application as an autocatalytic seed for chemical plating 4 conclusion in this work the photoreduction process of an acidic aqueous cu ii solution with tio2 as a photocatalyst under uv light irradiation was investigated in detail the cu ii ions in a solution with a low concentration can be effectively removed to meet the lowest wastewater discharging standard and the photo deposited product of cu ii in tio2 was determined to be cu 0 forming a cu 0 tio2 byproduct three stages of the photoreduction process from cu ii to cu 0 were confirmed regardless of what hole scavengers were employed namely an initial acceleration stage owing to the formation of a schottky junction between the tio2 and deposited cu 0 a middle stage with a constant photo deposition rate causing the growth of the cu 0 nuclei and a third deceleration stage controlled by the mass transfer of cu ii ions in the dilution the deposited cu 0 nps of the cu 0 tio2 composite byproduct exhibited an attractive catalyzation performance and sensitization effect owing to a high dispersion the cu 0 tio2 composite byproduct can be used to catalyze an rwgs reaction as a high efficiency catalyst with a 26 78 co2 conversion and 100 co selectivity under a temperature of 600 c photodegrade cr vi wastewater at a faster speed and a higher cr removal rate within the same time as the enhanced photocatalyst and deposit ni as a sensitization seed for the formation of a bimetallic site for possible application as a catalyst this study determined that the existing formation of cu ii after a photoreduction was cu 0 under acidic conditions and demonstrated possible applications of the cu 0 tio2 byproduct which can be further developed as a promising environmental treatment technology resulting in higher economy and efficiency

14266,acidic low concentration copper containing wastewater is technically a type of refractory wastewater in this study a tio2 photocatalyst was used to photo deposit cu ii from a cu containing dilution to produce a usable cu 0 tio2 composite byproduct which could be used as a catalyst for a reverse water gas shift reaction rwgs reaction a photocatalyst for a cr vi photo reduction and a crystal nucleus for chemical plating the photo deposition process of cu ii with tio2 500 under uv light was found to be divided into three stages an initial stage for acceleration through sensitization a middle stage for a constant rate and a final stage for deceleration through the slow mass transfer of the diluted cu ii after treating the wastewater to the discharge standard only cu 0 was observed on the tio2 surface which can be employed as a valuable byproduct the rwgs reaction can be effectively catalyzed by the cu 0 tio2 500 with a 26 78 co2 conversion and 100 co selectivity at a temperature of under 600 c the photocatalytic performance of tio2 500 is enhanced with the deposited cu shortening the time required to photo reduce the cr vi pollutants ni cu nanoparticles are also prepared from the sensitization effect of the deposited cu forming a bimetallic site as a possible catalyst this study demonstrated a promising economic process for environmental protection and waste recycling keywords cu containing wastewater three stage photoreduction recycling byproduct cu 0 tio2 catalyst 1 introduction acidic copper containing wastewater is a heavy metal pollutant which originates from various industries including chemical electroplating non ferrous metal smelting electronic materials paper and other industries 1 4 however the discharge of cu containing wastewater must obey a severe standard namely a 0 5 mg l allowable emission concentration of copper according to china s wastewater discharge standard gb8978 1996 the removal of cu from wastewater for environmental protection is therefore urgently needed 5 7 in acidic copper containing wastewater cu ii mostly exists in a free or complex form with inorganic ligands such as no3 cl so4 2 and h2o 8 9 many technologies including adsorption 10 11 ion exchange 12 14 membrane separation 15 16 and chemical precipitation 1 17 have been developed to achieve this severe standard however such traditional methods are usually imperfect owing to the possible need for secondary treatment of collected cu which has a relatively high cost and energy consumption the direct conversion of abandoned cu in wastewater into a useful product without further treatment is an attractive solution when considering environmental protection and the promotion of its commercial value the photo deposition process has been recently applied to the treatment of copper containing wastewater particularly at a low cu concentration owing to its low cost and being environmentally benign 9 18 19 to remove cu ii copper ions can be effectively reduced by photo generated electrons with a strong reducibility and captured onto the photocatalyst surface 20 tio2 is a common uv light driven photocatalyst that has typically been adopted for this cu ii photo deposition process however there are two problems pertaining to the application of this process the mechanism of cu ii photoreduction by tio2 is unclear as the form of the photo deposited cu species is unknown and there remains the question of whether it is possible to utilize the cu tio2 byproduct for additional economic benefit for the first problem cu 0 and cu ⅰ have both been considered as possible reducing products the existence of cu 0 on tio2 was theoretically analyzed by reiche 21 and confirmed through x ray absorption fine structure xafs spectroscopy 22 23 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 24 25 x ray diffraction xrd 19 and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum uv vis drs 26 however some evidence also indicates the existence of cu i on tio2 after photo deposition through electron paramagnetic resonance epr characterization 27 and in situ ftir spectroscopy of co adsorption 28 it has also been reported that when all cu ii in a solution has been reduced to cu2o the generated cu2o will be further reduced to cu 0 29 the co existence of cu 0 and cu2o after photo deposition has also been observed 30 31 this controversy has caused confusion in understanding the cu ii reduction mechanism with tio2 the second problem is directly related to the economic value of the photoreduction process for wastewater treatment the photo deposited cu obtained must be recovered properly through secondary treatment for recovery and environmental protection however current research into the photo deposition process has mainly focused on the development of a new photocatalyst 19 32 and an evaluation of its photoreduction efficiency 9 18 24 the chemical sludge produced from photo deposition has typically been ignored and rarely reused directly this chemical sludge containing the treated metal after photo deposition can be properly applied in other fields 33 34 therefore if this cu deposited composite byproduct cu tio2 can be directly converted into a usable product without extra cost for secondary treatment it would be economically and technically attractive in promoting the actual application of the photoreduction process in this study the photo deposition process of cu ii under acidic conditions ph 3 with uv light irradiation was investigated the mechanism and kinetic aspect of the cu ii photo deposition process applied to tio2 were deeply explored the various potential application fields of the cu tio2 byproduct obtained were considered based on an understanding of the cu ii photo deposition mechanism for bettering the application value of the photo reduction process 2 experimental 2 1 materials butyl titanate isopropanol ch3 2choh and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab were used

total of 0 4 g of ctab was added to the solution containing 10 ml of butyl titanate and 40 ml of ch3 2choh and the solution was then magnetically stirred for 30 min to dissolve the added ctab next 20 ml of a ch3 2choh solution containing 10 water was dropped into the above solution and stirred continuously for 4 h after the addition was completed the mixture obtained was separated through centrifugation and then dried at 70 for 24 h after washing five times with ultrapure water finally the solid obtained namely tio2 x where x 300 400 500 600 and 700 was calcined at 300 400 500 600 and

100 mg l was prepared using cuso4 5h2o and ultrapure water and the ph value was adjusted to 3 using hno3 the photodegradation experiments were carried out in a photoreactor aulight lab500e4 china with a 50 ml quartz tube and a 500 w mercury lamp under magnetic stirring a 0 06 g tio2 photocatalyst 20 ml cuso4 solution and 1 ml scavenger including hcooh ch3oh c2h5oh ch2oh 2 and c3h7oh were added to the tube for photodegradation the cu concentration of the solution during the photoreaction was monitored using an icp oes thermo scientific icap7400 usa 2 5 utilization of cu 0 tio2 a reverse water gas shift reaction rwgs was carried out in a continuous flow fixed bed reactor a total of 0 1 g of cu 0 tio2 obtained from a cu ii photoreduction or fresh tio2 500 was placed in a quartz tube reactor with a 4 mm diameter the reaction temperature ranged between 300 c and 600 c and the feeding space velocity of the co2 h2 mixture was 36 000 ml h 1 g 1 the tail gas was analyzed using gas

in a 50 ml vessel by adding 0 06 g of cu 0 tio2 into a 20 ml plating solution with a ph of 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 tio2 500 photo deposition process for cu ii removal the photocatalyst used for this study tio2 was home made and screened out based on its adsorption and photoreduction performance for cu ii removal the optimal version tio2 500 possessed an anatase crystal form fig s1 and the narrowest band gap of 3 04 ev fig s2 the photoreduction of cu ii can be completed within 6 min with a removal efficiency of 98 51 using the as prepared tio2 500 fig s3 a thus tio2 500 was determined to be the main objective for successive studies on the mechanics and byproduct utilization usually organic contaminants are involved in acidic cu containing wastewater treatment and are treated as cod inevitably the existence of these impurities will seriously affect the photoreduction fortunately a hole scavenger is necessary in the photoreduction process of cu ii and these organic contaminants can play such a role thus the influence of different typical organics as scavengers in the photoreduction process of cu ii with tio2 500 was investigated as shown in fig 1 a the 30 min dark adsorption of cu ii with tio2 500 was guaranteed to result in an adsorption equilibrium although the real adsorption amount of cu ii can be neglected table s1 with different organic scavenges the complete removal of aqueous cu ii with a final concentration of lower than 0 5 mg l can be achieved using tio2 500 under uv light irradiation however the photo deposition speed used to achieve the cu ii removal differs with hcooh and ch2oh 2 as a hole scavenger cu ii in wastewater can be lowered to 0 48 and 0 41 mg l within 5 min using photo deposition with tio2 500 respectively however when replacing a scavenger with ch3oh c2h5oh and c3h7oh the time consumed to reach the wastewater discharge standard increases to 6 7 and 9 min respectively in addition the effects of light type fig s3 b photoreaction atmosphere fig s3 c and the addition of common cations such as na ca2 and mg2 fig s3 d on the photoreaction process were also explored as shown in fig s3 b cu2 removal efficiency is highest 94 40 under uv light from fig s3 c tio2 500 has the highest cu2 removal efficiency 95 04 under nitrogen protection as shown in fig s3 d the addition of cations reduces the removal efficiency of cu2 and na has the greatest impact on the photo deposition process based on the entire photo deposition process shown in fig 1 a three stages can be applied an initial stage for acceleration a middle stage for a constant rate and a final stage for a deceleration regardless of which scavenger is employed the control step of photo deposition is the diffusion of cu2 and adsorption plays an important role in this process 35 due to the existence of adsorption the current researchs 24 36 on photo deposition of cu2 were consistent with the first order kinetic model and no obvious initial stage was found this is because a large amount of cu2 is present on the surface of the photocatalyst due to adsorption and those cu2 is rapidly reduced to cu0 after the light is turned on which makes the initial stage difficult to be observed the kinetics in these studies are not intrinsic photo deposition of cu2 kinetics due to the effects of adsorption the adsorption of cu2 by tio2 500 used in this paper is negligible so this process demonstrates the true photo deposition of cu2 the initial stage may be explained as the formation phase of cu nuclei deposited on a photocatalyst surface owing to the photoreduction of cu ii these deposited cu nuclei can evoke the schottky effect promoting the separation of a photo generated hole and electron pairs and increasing the quantum efficiency of the photocatalyst with an increase in the amount of deposited cu the photoreduction capacity of photocatalyst should be improved and an acceleration effect appears however the different time consumed for this copper sensitized stage depends on the capacity of the different hole scavengers for capturing photo generated holes the stronger the reducibility is the faster the initial acceleration stage after the initial stage sufficient cu deposits onto the tio2 surface and the speed of generation and consumption of the photo generated carriers reaches a state of equilibrium therefore the middle stage with a constant photoreaction rate is formed a linear decrease in the cu ii concentration can be observed owing to the constant surface photoreaction rate as shown in fig 1 b the correlated kinetic constant of the middle stage with different scavengers through a linear fitting of the cu ii concentration over time were all close to 4 600 mg l min except for formic acid 6 511 mg l min confirming their similar degradation speed the reason why formic acid as hole scavenger has a different kinetic constant is that formic acid directly consumes photogenerated holes while other hole scavengers consume hydroxyl radicals oh 20 in the third stage the reaction rate was controlled through the mass transfer of cu ii ions owing to the extremely dilute solution thus a deceleration stage of cu ii removal is formed 3 2 characterizations of the catalyst before and after photo deposition however the above speculation of the cu ii removal process through a photoreduction should be further investigated for confirmation the existence of cu species on fresh tio2 500 and tio2 500 after a 9 min photoreduction in 20 mg l cu ii with c3h7oh as the scavenger was thus characterized because this process is the slowest providing the greatest information the xrd results in fig 2 confirm that the crystal form of tio2 500 both before and after photoreduction is anatase without any detectable change the diffraction peaks at 25 58 37 80 and 48 05 were assigned to the 101 004 and 200 crystal planes of anatase respectively no observable peaks ascribed to the cu species were detected suggesting the amorphous or high dispersion of cu on the tio2 surface the sem analysis of tio2 500 before and after the photo reaction in fig 3 a and b also exhibited a similar blocky morphonology of the tio2 samples without a significant change the results of the n2 adsorption desorption table s2 showed that the bet surface area of fresh tio2 500 was 42 82 m2 g with mainly mesopores with a diameter of approximately 15 nm fig s4 b after photoreaction the bet surface area of used tio2 500 was 25 60 m2 g table s2 with a diameter of approximately 10 nm fig s4 d the decrease in the bet surface area and pore size is due to copper deposited on the surface of tio2 500 the hrtem results shown in fig 3 c and d reaffirmed that only the crystal plane attributed to anatase tio2 including 101 004 and 200 of a fresh photocatalyst and 101 103 and 105 of a used photocatalyst can be observed the existence of the cu species was still not determined however employing an sem mapping analysis to determine the possible components on the used tio2 sample surface the existence of cu species was ascertained as shown in fig 4 a scattered distribution of cu element was exhibited although its density was significantly sparser than that of ti and o the ratio of ti and o was roughly 1 2 according to the ratio of titania but the cu distribution was significantly less indicating its high dispersion and low content however despite the existence of a cu species on tio2 after photoreduction was ascertained its formation needs to be determined the cu xps analysis shown in fig 5 indicates this problem no signals ascribed to the cu species were found through the xps results of fresh tio2 500 fig 5 a however for the used sample two remarkable peaks at 931 8 ev and 951 5 ev appeared which belong to cu2p3 2 and cu2p1 2 fig 5 b respectively these peaks should be assigned to the peak shift of cu 0 owing to the absence of a satellite peak of cu2p which should be observed if cu2o and cuo are present 37 38 compared with previous studies 39 the shift of the peak value of approximately 1 ev should be attributed to the low energy of cu2p caused by the high dispersion status of cu 0 on tio2 40 41 to further prove that the formation of the photo reduced cu ii was cu 0 the cu lmm xaes spectrum was determined as shown in fig 5 c and d only a peak of ti2s at 565 ev in the fresh sample was observed as indicated in fig 5 c however for the used sample a small signal at 568 0 ev ascribed to cu 0 was detected although it was partially overlapped by the ti2s peak which was totally different from that of cu2o at 569 4 ev and that of cuo at 568 5 ev 42 to exclude the interference of ti2s and further confirm the existence of cu 0 after photoreduction a uv vis drs analysis was conducted as shown in fig 6 a compared to the spectrum of fresh tio2 500 the spectrum of the used sample exhibits a slope peak at 575 nm which was caused by localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of the metallic cu 26 43 44 the adsorption edge increased from 418 9 nm in fresh tio2 500 to 444 4 nm in the used sample indicating a band to band transition of the anatase and a d d transition of the cu 0 45 the relatively strong adsorption of the used sample in the visible light spectrum compared with the fresh sample should be ascribed to an increasing visible light harvesting ability resulting from the lspr of the metallic cu converting the data into αһʋ 2 and һʋ according to the kubelka munk formula 46 47 the band gap of the fresh tio2 500 was 2 96 ev whereas that of the used tio2 500 was 2 79 ev as indicated in fig 6 b therefore the change in absorption edge band gap and absorbance of the catalyst before and after the photo reaction all confirmed the deposition of cu 0 onto tio2 pl testing of tio2 500 before and after photoreduction was carried out as shown in fig 7 the fluorescence intensity of tio2 500 after the photo reaction was significantly reduced indicating a reduction in the recombination rate of the electron hole pairs this reduction should be ascribed to the formation of a heterojunction constructed using tio2 and deposited cu 0 such a junction formed schottky barrier and improved charge transport efficiency generate a sensitization effect and enhance the photocatalytic performance in addition the fluorescence at 400 nm ascribed to the excited tio2 and at 469 nm ascribed to the oxygen vacancies 48 was detected thus the existence of the deposited cu after photo reduction using tio2 was determined to be cu 0 and resulted in an intensification of the photocatalytic performance for the successive photocatalysis processes the following reaction 49 is assumed to usually occur in the photo deposition process of cu ii with tio2 under light irradiation 1 cu2 2e cu eθ 0 337 ev 2 2cu2 h2o 2e cu2o 2h eθ 0 203 ev here cu ii can be reduced using anatase to form cu 0 or cu i according to these equations because the cb of anatase was 0 3 ev and the vb was 2 9 ev 20 however owing to the acidic condition ph 3 and low concentration approximately 0 315 mmol l the standard electrode potential 298 15 k of cu ii cu changed to 0 234 ev according to the nernst equation which was greater than cu ii cu2o 0 173 ev under the same conditions in addition when cu was generated it was unstable and a disproportionation reaction spontaneously occurred to form cu 0 and cu2 according to the following reactions 49 3 cu2 e cu eθ 0 153 ev 4 cu e cu eθ 0 520 ev 5 4 3 2cu cu2 cu e 0 367 ev therefore there is no observable cu i in the solution or on the tio2 during the entire photo deposition process which is in accord with the occurrence during the experiment and the characterization 3 3 process mechanism of photo deposition of cu ii although the light driven deposition of cu ii on tio2 500 was confirmed the occurrence of the three stages during the total photoreduction process should be discussed in detail for further understanding a pre deposited tio2 500 sample was used to mimic the photocatalyst after completing the initial induction stage approximately 0 033 wt of cu 0 according to the cu balance calculation conducted during the previous experiment was photo deposited onto tio2 500 as shown in fig 8 a the pre deposited tio2 500 decreased the 20 mg l cu ii solution to 0 47 mg l in 6 min using c3h7oh as the scavenger whereas the fresh tio2 500 was consumed in 9 min the sensitization stage during the photo deposition process of the pre deposited tio2 500 was eliminated and only a similar middle stage with a constant rate and a decelerate stage could be observed by linearly fitting the cu ii concentration over time during the middle stage it was found that the slopes k of the fresh tio2 500 and pre deposited tio2 500 were 4 413 mg l min and 4 602 mg l min respectively showing that the middle stage with the same constant rate obeyed the zero order dynamic model the occurrence of the cu ii removal rate acceleration during the initial stage is undoubtedly ascribed to the sensitization of the trace amount of cu 0 deposited on the tio2 500 surface which formed a schottky junction with tio2 to promote the separation of the electron hole pairs the pre deposited sample was then analyzed through tem mapping to detect the trace cu element on tio2 500 as shown in fig 8 c a uniformly dispersed signal of cu can be observed although its density is quite low considering the fact that the pre deposited sample was washed adequately and the adsorbed cu species should be cleansed it can be regarded that cu 0 was deposited on the photocatalyst surface forming a schottky junction and sensitizing the tio2 500 to further confirm whether the occurrence of the acceleration stage is independent of the cu ii concentration in a solution an acidic solution was replaced with a 100 mg l cu ii solution with a ph value of 3 after 30 min of adsorption in the dark a photo deposition of cu ii was carried out under uv light using c3h7oh as the scavenger a similar three stage process was found as shown in fig 9 a although the total time consumed was significantly prolongated three stages namely acceleration a constant rate and deceleration were observed the time extension of the initial stage should be ascribed to the high cu ii concentration whereas the kinetics of the cu ii photo deposition process during the three stages was not affected xrd and hrtem analyses of a photo deposited sample from a 100 mg l cu ii solution were conducted to acquire visual evidence of cu deposition as shown in fig 9 b and c because the sample from the 20 mg l solution cannot be observed directly through these two characterization approaches the xrd results in fig 9 b confirmed the existence of metallic cu in the used tio2 500 based on the peaks at 43 30 and 50 43 which were assigned to the 111 and 200 crystal faces of the metallic cu respectively this result also confirms the crystal formation and growth of cu nanoparticles because these peaks are invisible in the xrd results of the samples from the 20 mg l cu ii solution as shown in fig 2 this occurrence is similar to the growth mechanism of the reported pb and cr photo deposition on au nps with tio2 as a photocatalyst 50 it can be deduced that the growth of cu nps should also occur around the formed cu nuclei causing them to enlarge the existence of such large cu nps was also directly reaffirmed through the tem results of the used tio2 500 as fig 9 c shows lattice diffraction fringes of approximately 5 10 nm cu nps on the surface of the used sample from the 100 mg l cu ii solution can be clearly seen which was assigned to the 111 crystal plane of the metallic cu a three stage process of cu ii photoreduction with tio2 500 as a photocatalyst under acidic conditions was proposed and is described in scheme 1 during the initial stage the dissolved cu ii was adsorbed and photo reduced into cu 0 and deposited onto the active site of the tio2 surface forming tiny cu 0 nuclei which are difficult to detect however such tiny nuclei still can construct a schottky junction with tio2 to intensify the photoactivity theoretically when the work function of the metal is greater than the work function of the n type semiconductor their close contact can form schottky junction which can effectively prevent the reverse transfer of photogenerated electrons trapped by metal 51 52 the work function of tio2 and metallic cu are 4 12 ev and 4 97 ev respectively 53 therefore schottky junction can form at the interface between cu0 and tio2 with the increase in the deposited cu the photocatalytic performance of tio2 continued to be enhanced causing an acceleration effect until almost all active sites were covered by the cu 0 nuclei and the photoreaction reached the maximum speed the photo deposition process then entered the second stage with a constant speed owing to the deposited cu 0 nuclei the photo generated electrons by tio2 were enriched on the cu surface attracting the cu ii ions and inducing a successive photoreduction the cu 0 nuclei in this stage grew and formed cu 0 nps this stage was determined based on the intrinsic photoreaction rate and caused a relative steady linear photodegradation speed against the cu ii concentration with a further decrease in the cu ii content in the solution the apparent photoreaction rate slowed owing to the slow diffusion of cu ii ions in extremely diluted solutions most of the cu ii ions were deposited as cu 0 nps and the photoreaction was controlled through the mass transfer of residual aqueous cu ii ions the photoreduction process entered the third deceleration stage and the cu ii concentration remaining in the water met the requested concentration for discharge namely 0 5 mg l 3 4 application of byproducts for wastewater treatment the removal of contaminants and the reuse of resources are both important from an economic perspective however during this process although cu ii is removed from water the cu containing sludge byproduct has not been further utilized as of yet causing possible secondary pollution and increasing the treatment cost it is therefore necessary to determine the usability of the cu deposited tio2 byproduct a copper based catalyst has been widely developed in many fields such as the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons 54 55 hydrogenation 55 57 and dehydrogenation 58 60 the cu 0 tio2 byproduct possessed lots of cu nps deposited on surface with high dispersion and can be applied as a catalyst without a successive pre treatment the loaded cu species exhibit a schottky barrier effect enhancing the photocatalytic performance of the tio2 25 61 62 thus cu 0 tio2 also has potential as a highly efficient photocatalyst based on its sensitization effect in addition cu 0 is usually employed as a seed for chemical plating owing to its autocatalytic activity cu 0 tio2 can be regarded as particles with a sensitized cu seed therefore three possible applications namely an rwgs reaction with cu 0 tio2 as a catalyst cr vi removal of wastewater with cu 0 tio2 as a photocatalyst and nickel electroless plating with cu 0 tio2 as a sensitized seed have been attempted to determine the application potential of a cu 0 tio2 byproduct from the cu ii treatment process three samples fresh tio2 500 and used tio2 500 from 20 and 100 mg l of cu containing wastewater were applied for an rwgs reaction and their cu contents were 0 wt 0 66 wt and 3 33 wt respectively as shown in fig 10 a the catalytic performance of pure tio2 500 for an rwgs reaction can be neglected however the plots in fig 10 b and c confirm that the 0 66 wt and 3 33 wt cu 0 tio2 500 byproducts can both effectively catalyze the conversion of co2 into co with an increase in temperature the co2 conversion catalyzed using 0 66 wt and 3 33 wt cu 0 tio2 500 increased from 0 28 and 0 57 at 300 c to 26 57 and 26 78 at 600 c respectively the co selectivity of both reached 100 within the entire temperature region the turnover frequency tof of the two byproducts were calculated based on the loaded cu mass because the cu content of the 0 66 wt sample was too low to be detected using h2 tpr fig s5 at 600 c a tof value of the 0 66 wt sample reached as high as 29 59 mol gcu h which is much larger than the 5 90 mol gcu h of the sample with 3 33 wt cu content the five fold increase in value of the mass based tof is inverse proportional to the mass increase in the deposited cu this result suggests that the increase in loaded cu content did not increase the amount of the active site because the two co2 conversion plots almost overlapped the effective surface of the cu nps for catalyzation had mostly not increased indirectly indicating that the volume largening of the cu nps and not their quantity occurred at the constant speed of cu ii during the photoreduction process this result confirms that the cu 0 tio2 500 byproduct is an effective catalyst candidate for an rwgs reaction the fresh and used tio2 500 samples were also used as photocatalysts to remove cr vi from water under uv light as shown in fig 10 d the total cr content in the solution was treated from 50 to 1 48 mg l within 120 min by cu 0 tio2 500 with c3h7oh as the scavenger which is lower than the requested value of 1 5 mg l based on the chinese wastewater discharging standard gb 8978 1996 however for the fresh tio2 the total cr content after 120 min was 5 47 mg l and it was difficult to achieve a further decrease to the standard even when the time was extended to more than 160 min 3 59 mg l this result confirms that cu 0 tio2 500 achieved a better photocatalytic performance than the anatase and can be applied as a photocatalyst for waste water treatment the feasibility of using cu 0 tio2 500 as a sensitized seed to initiate electroless nickel plating was confirmed and the sem and sem mapping results of cu 0 tio2 500 and cu 0 tio2 500 after nickel plating are shown in fig 11 compared with cu 0 tio2 500 in fig 11 a the plated sample in fig 11 b exhibited many small spherical nanoparticles deposited on the surface the sem mapping analysis results shown in fig 11 c e exhibit the co existence of ni and cu elements with a uniform dispersion all of which were localized at the site of small spherical nanoparticles the amount of ni was more than that of cu but their distributions almost overlapped this occurrence confirms the sensitization effect of cu in the cu 0 tio2 500 induced ni deposition further ni growth occurred with the cu site as the nuclei formed a spherical shape creating a bimetallic site for possible application as a catalyst this result also confirms the sensitization effect of cu in cu 0 tio2 500 demonstrating its possible application as an autocatalytic seed for chemical plating 4 conclusion in this work the photoreduction process of an acidic aqueous cu ii solution with tio2 as a photocatalyst under uv light irradiation was investigated in detail the cu ii ions in a solution with a low concentration can be effectively removed to meet the lowest wastewater discharging standard and the photo deposited product of cu ii in tio2 was determined to be cu 0 forming a cu 0 tio2 byproduct three stages of the photoreduction process from cu ii to cu 0 were confirmed regardless of what hole scavengers were employed namely an initial acceleration stage owing to the formation of a schottky junction between the tio2 and deposited cu 0 a middle stage with a constant photo deposition rate causing the growth of the cu 0 nuclei and a third deceleration stage controlled by the mass transfer of cu ii ions in the dilution the deposited cu 0 nps of the cu 0 tio2 composite byproduct exhibited an attractive catalyzation performance and sensitization effect owing to a high dispersion the cu 0 tio2 composite byproduct can be used to catalyze an rwgs reaction as a high efficiency catalyst with a 26 78 co2 conversion and 100 co selectivity under a temperature of 600 c photodegrade cr vi wastewater at a faster speed and a higher cr removal rate within the same time as the enhanced photocatalyst and deposit ni as a sensitization seed for the formation of a bimetallic site for possible application as a catalyst this study determined that the existing formation of cu ii after a photoreduction was cu 0 under acidic conditions and demonstrated possible applications of the cu 0 tio2 byproduct which can be further developed as a promising environmental treatment technology resulting in higher economy and efficiency

14267,mercury is one of the most toxic and unnecessary elements for human body in a way that only slight amount of it can cause serious hygienic problems and environmental pollution in the present study magnetized single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts functionalized by polydopamine was employed for elimination of mercury heavy metal ions from aqueous media in order to characterize the physical and chemical properties of the swcnt and to confirm the functionalization steps different analyses including tem sem vsm eds ft ir were utilized in the present paper the effects of experimental parameters such as adsorbent dosage solution ph metallic ion initial concentration process thermodynamics and desorption mechanism on batch system were widely studied in addition mercury adsorption trend in continuous system was investigated by a fixed bed reactor comparison of adsorption process kinetics were done with models of freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich in batch system and consistency with yan and thomas models in continuous system by sigma plot and matlab software packs isotherm studies and adsorption kinetics revealed that mercury ions follow freundlich adsorption isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model moreover thermodynamic studies showed that mercury ion adsorption is an exothermic and spontaneous reaction although thomas model was found to predict more exact results for maximum mercury ion adsorption both thomas and yan models had good fitness with fixed bed reactor data finally adsorption process demonstrated that removal efficiency of the prepared adsorbent was so much higher than raw swcnts keywords mercury adsorption kinetics thermodynamics polydopamine 1 introduction water pollution all around the world has been turned to a global crisis the quality of water sources gets critical day by day according to population growth rapid development of industries agricultural activities and other geometrical and environmental changes 1 continuous release of different contaminations such as heavy metals and organic compounds into the environment caused a serious global issue 2 removal of heavy and toxic metals from water is one of the most important environmental challenges which attracts high attention 3 lead pb cadmium cd and mercury hg among heavy metals are considered as high priority elements based on 2008 105 ec instruction by european union parliament and of european council on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy 4 mercury is a very toxic element that has high toxicity even in low doses 5 mercury is found in the form of elemental hg0 metallic hg ii and organic mehg in the nature all three forms of hg is toxic but metallic hg and organic hg have higher toxicity to living organisms 6 hg is a threat not only to human health but also to microorganisms plants and animals 7 hg has a very high tendency for biological accumulation bioconcentration in living organisms in addition to ability of transmission to higher levels of food pyramid in food chains by biological magnification biomagnification 5 methyl mercury is one of the forms of organic mercury which affects the nervous system in short time exposures and has negative effect on kidneys in long term exposures 8 lately investigations showed that methyl mercury also disturbs the pancreas and glucose metabolism performances 6 based on world health organization who instructions the allowed limit of hg content in water is 0 006 mg l 9 according to the mentioned restrictions hg and cd removal from aqueous solutions is vital for maintaining a healthy society so several methods have been used for elimination of heavy metals from water selecting a specific method is based on financial efficiency and level of heavy metal initial concentration 8 oxidation reduction reverse osmosis biofiltration electrodialysis coagulation and flocculation membrane filtration ion exchange and adsorption are considered as the most popular techniques for removing metal ions 10 11 all of the aforementioned techniques have their own restrictions and advantages where adsorption is considered as a beneficial and efficient method for filtering wastewaters the most significant advantages of adsorption in comparison with other methods are high efficiency low cost and possibility of metal recycling 12 additionally the so called adsorbents can be recycled and reused by desorption process 13 in recent years cnts were used for contamination removal from aqueous solutions due to high specific surface low density porous structure and high interaction with contaminants molecules 14 cnts do not react with most of the elements because of specific chemical structure therefor change in physical and chemical state of its surface is required for adsorption of metallic ions 8 nowadays achieving to an adsorbent including some characteristics such as environmental friendly economical preparation method using non toxic material high adsorption capacity renewability and stability is in superior according to these facts some synthetized adsorbents have been developed for mercury removal such as pd eda cs 15 swcnt sh 16 canps 17 mwcnts fe3o4 18 cmnc 19 and swcnts 20 lack of separation ability from the solutions in these adsorbents after the adsorbing process and development of secondary contaminations are the most significant restrictions of these adsorbents it seems that magnetic separation is the best alternative method to overcome these restrictions however more attempts are needed for expanding the practical applications of these materials in future 21 hence in the present study swcnts were first doped with magnetic particles then functionalized by polydopamine polydopamine is a non toxic biopolymer 22 containing hydroxyl and amine functional groups that are effective in divalent metal ions removal so integrated existing these functional groups and magnetic characteristics make this synthetized adsorbent suitable for mercury removal all in all it can be acknowledged that the purpose of this investigation is hg ion removal from aqueous solutions by swcnts which were functionalized by polydopamine furthermore the effect of experimental parameters such as adsorbent dosage ph metallic ion initial concentration thermodynamics and desorption on batch system were studied precisely on the other hand hg ion adsorption trend in continuous system using fixed bed reactor was evaluated the performance of adsorbing reactor with different variables of reactor height metallic ion initial concentration and input flow rate was investigated kinetics of the process and consistency of adsorption process in both batch and continuous systems were investigated 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and equipments single wall carbon nanotubes more than 95 purity inner diameter of 0 8 1 6 nm external diameter of 1 2 nm 5 30 nm length density of 0 14 g cm3 specific

the samples scanning electron microscopy sem seron model ais 2100 south korea and transmission electron microscopy tem philips model cm 120 netherlands were employed to obtain high resolution micrographs of the samples refrigerat centrifuge hettich model r320 germany was used to separate the adsorbent from the samples peristaltic pump heidolph model 5101 germany was employed to regulate the solution flow rate shaker incubator hach model 205 germany was utilized for adjusting the temperature digital ph meter metrohm model 724 germany equipped with glass electrode was used to measure the ph hotplate magnetic stirrer ika germany and digital balance with precision of 0 001 g gf300 japan were also used 2 2 functionalizing of cnts 0 5 g swcnts was placed in a beaker containing 50 ml deionized water in ultrasonic homogenizer for 30 min the dispersed cnts were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper then cnts were added to 100 ml of 1 5 m naoh solution and stirred vigorously 0 5 g fecl2 4h2o and 1 3 g fecl3 6h2o were dissolved in 25 ml deionized water and deoxygenized after that 0 85 ml concentrated hcl was added to the solution and the resulted solution was added dropwise to the dispersed cnts under ultra sonication afterwards the mixture was separated by a powerful magnet and the obtained nanoparticles were washed 3 times by 200 ml deionized water the prepared nanoparticles were dried at 40 c which leaded to formation of swcnt fe3o4 1 g polydopamine was added to 1 g swcnt fe3o4 dispersed in 500 ml tris buffer 10 mm ph 8 5 and stirred for 24 h at ambient temperature after completion of the reaction obtaining swcnts fe3o4 pda the product was separated by a magnet washed with deionized water and ethanol and dried fig 1 represents the steps of cnts functionalization 2 3 batch adsorption experiments the adsorption of hg ii ion from aqueous solutions in batch system was carried out in a 250 ml beaker containing 100 ml of metal and adsorbent solution stirring at 200 rpm first the stock solution was prepared with 1000 mg l concentration and other required concentrations were made daily as fresh solutions by diluting with deionized water electrical conductivity 0 05 μs m for optimization of adsorption process first a certain amount of adsorbent was examined in constant conditions of ph metal initial concentration and room temperature 25 c after determination of optimum adsorbent amount the adsorption experiment was evaluated in different ph values in the following by changing the metallic ion initial concentration the effect of concentration on adsorption was studied and finally the effect of temperature on experimental condition was inspected in each set of experiments sampling was carried out after 5 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min then the solution containing metallic ion and the adsorbent was filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filter the concentration of hg in the solutions was measured via chromatography method using dithizone solution by uv vis spectrophotometer at 480 nm 23 in every experiment adsorption efficiency was calculated by eq 1 1 r 100 c 0 c e c 0 where c0 ce and r are initial concentration mg l equivalent concentration mg l and adsorption percent by the adsorbent in the metallic ion solution respectively in most of the previous studies the adsorbent efficiency was reported by hg adsorbing percent it is obvious that this term cannot represent a tangible adsorbing capacity because adsorbing percent is a relative parameter which is changing at different adsorbent dosage and metal initial concentration 24 for this purpose in order to attain an actual amount of adsorption capacity hg adsorbed ions per adsorbent dosage was calculated according to eq 2 2 q e v m c 0 c e where qe v m and c0 and ce are adsorption equivalent capacity mg g which shows the adsorbed hg ions per gram metallic solution volume l adsorbent amount g initial concentration and equivalent concentration respectively to study the metallic ion adsorption process in different conditions effective parameters including adsorbent dosage ph temperature and metallic ion concentration were inspected 2 3 1 the effect of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage on the hg removal efficiency was evaluated for 100 200 300 and 400 mg l of adsorbent in this investigation 100 ml of hg ii was separately prepared with 20 mg l metallic ion concentration in ph 7 for 60 min and transferred to a 250 ml flask then 100 400 mg l of the prepared adsorbents were added and the mixture was stirred at 200 rpm for 60 min as equivalent time 2 3 2 effect of ph the process of heavy metals adsorption is highly depended on ph of the solution to evaluate the effect of ph on adsorption process ph was adjusted to 2 4 6 7 and 8 by 0 1 m hcl and naoh solutions these experiments were carried out with 200 mg l adsorbent dosage and 20 mg l metallic ion concentration 2 3 3 effect of metallic ion concentration initial concentration of the pollutant is one of the factors that affects the adsorption efficiency to determine the effect of metallic ion concentration on process efficiency hg metallic ions concentrations of 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l was examined at ph 7 and 200 mg l adsorbent dosage during 60 min of contact time 2 3 4 effects of temperature and adsorption thermodynamics temperature is one of the other important parameters which affects the adsorption process to study the effect of temperature on adsorption hg adsorption process was investigated at 15 25 35 and 45 c temperature adjustment was done by shaker incubator other parameters of metal concentration adsorbent dosage and ph were kept constant as 20 mg l 200 mg l and 7 respectively evaluation of thermodynamic parameters requires the determination of distribution coefficient k which is temperature dependent this was calculated by eq 3 25 3 k d c c e c e v w where v l and w g are solution volume and adsorbent weight respectively other thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy δg0 enthalpy δh0 and entropy δs0 were determined using eqs 4 and 5 26 4 l n k d δs r δh r t 5 δg δh tδs where r is gas universal constant 8 314 j mol k and t is temperature k δh0 j mol and δs0 j mol k were obtained from the slope and y intercept of van hoff diagram by drawing ln kd vs 1 t respectively enthalpy represents the change of internal energy level of the solution during adsorption process that can explain the exothermic δh 0 or endothermic δh 0 nature of the reaction while entropy represents the increase or decrease of disorder in the adsorbing system 2 3 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption equivalent capacity is one of the most important parameters which can be assessed by isotherm studies 27 for this reason different concentrations of hg 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l were prepared other parameters of adsorbent dosage ph temperature stirring speed and time kept constant as 200 mg l 7 25 c 200 rpm and 60 min respectively in this study the consistency of adsorption process experimental data with langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models was studied in langmuir adsorption isotherm it is supposed that the adsorbed material only interacts with limited number of uniform adsorption sites and adsorption is restricted only to monolayer on the surface hence there is identical energy and enthalpy for every ion in a solution during the adsorption process langmuir isotherm is expressed as eq 6 28 6 q e q m b c e 1 b c e where qe is adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g ce is equilibrium concentration of metallic ions mg l qm is the maximum value of adsorption capacity in monolayer adsorption mg g and b is the equilibrium constant that correlates to bond formation energy in adsorption process and represents the adsorption ability l mg freundlich isotherm is an experimental model based on multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces and established according heterogeneous distribution of energy on active sites of adsorbent freundlich model is expressed as eq 7 29 7 q e k f c e 1 n where qe ce kf and 1 n are adsorbed metallic ion mg g equilibrium concentration of metallic ions in the solution mg l capacity constant mg g l mg 1 n which denotes the relative adsorbing capacity of the adsorbent and adsorption intensity constant respectively by changing the degree of heterogeneity n is also changed if 1 n 1 or 1 n 10 it shows the desirable and beneficial adsorption 30 dubinin radushkevich isotherm generally denotes the adsorption mechanism by gaussian energy distribution on a heterogeneous surface gaussian function distribution is exponential function with symmetrical bell shape diagram which is used for normal distribution and named after carl friedrich gauss the mathematician nonlinear form of dubinin radushkevich model is expressed as eq 9 23 8 q e q m exp k e 2 where e r t l n 1 1 c e or e 2 k 1 2 kj mol k is dubinin radushkevich isotherm constant mol kj 2 r is universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is temperature k 2 3 6 kinetic studies the experiment was carried out with 200 mg l adsorbent dosage ph 7 t 25 c and different hg concentrations of 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l kinetic models were used to determine the adsorption rate and possible mechanisms of process 31 pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models are models for adsorption reaction which were employed for determination of adsorption rate in the present study the pseudo first order model assumes that adsorption in the solution changes with time and correlates to changes of saturation concentration and adsorbent adsorption during time 32 this model was expressed by lagrange as eq 9 that is used for adsorption of solutes from a solution 29 9 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t where qe and qt are the adsorbed material during equilibrium time and t time mg g respectively k1 is kinetic rate constant for pseudo first order model 1 min 29 if pseudo first order model is applicable log qe qt vs t must have a linear relation where its slope and y intercept represents k1 and logqe respectively 33 pseudo second order kinetic model expressed the dependence of adsorption rate to adsorption capacity in the solid phase which is independent of adsorbed material 32 this model was suggested by ho in 1995 as eq 10 34 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are adsorbed material at equilibrium and t times mg g respectively while k2 is kinetic rate constant for pseudo second order model g mg min 29 if pseudo second order model is applicable diagram of t qt min g mg vs t min must be linear where its slope and y intercept are qe2 and k2 respectively 31 in this model the amount of initial adsorption rate of hg mg g min is also calculated from eq 11 35 11 h k 2 q e 2 2 2 3 7 adsorption and desorption in batch system in this study 5 stages of adsorption and desorption of hg ii ion were investigated for the prepared adsorbents the adsorbents were washed twice by deionized water after the adsorption process and separated by centrifuge to select an acidic solution with high desorption efficiency 0 1 n of hcl h2so4 and hno3 were prepared and after that the most desirable acidic solution was tested in 0 2 and 0 05 n concentrations too therefore the most efficient acidic solution with the optimum concentration was determined adsorption process was carried out with 20 mg l concentration of hg ii 200 mg l adsorbent dosage ph 7 working volume of 50 ml and equilibrium time of 60 min after every stage the percent of removed hg ii and recovery percent were calculated by eq 12 12 m e t a l r e c o v e r y a m o u n t o f m e t a l i o n s d e s o r b e d a m o u n t o f m e t a l i o n s a d s o r b e d 100 2 4 adsorption in continuous system fixed bed reactor for characterization of adsorption in continuous system a fixed bed column in laboratory scale was prepared experiments were done using a glass fixed bed with 5 mm thickness and 20 cm height to reach the optimum conditions for removing hg ions parameters of solution flow rate adsorbent height and different concentrations of metallic ions were studied adsorption measurements were performed with column heights of 7 14 and 21 mm different flow rates of 1 1 5 and 2 ml min and different metallic ions concentrations of 20 30 and 40 mg l to do so first 0 06 g of the absorbent swcnts fe3o4 pda was poured into the glass column then the prepared adsorbent was fixed using 1 cm height glass wool in the bottom of the column in order to prevent the adsorbent exhaustion in addition to provide fine distribution of solution on the adsorbent surface and keeping the solution flow rate constant in this system the flow rate was adjusted by peristaltic pump using deionized water and then hg ii solution with different concentrations were pump into the column in upflow mode 2 4 1 column data analysis the change of effluent concentration to initial concentration from adsorbent bed vs time diagram represents breakthrough curve 23 breakthrough curves reveal the performance of the fixed bed column breakthrough time and the form of breakthrough curve are very important features for determination of performance and adsorption dynamic response when the concentration of metallic ions in the effluent ceff or ct reached to 0 1 of concentration of initial ions c0 breakthrough time equals to tb also when the concentration of the effluent ions reached to 95 of the initial ions it is referred as column exhaustion time te the breakthrough diagram is turned to s shape which is usually expressed by ct c0 as a function of time 36 the surrounding space in the upper side of the breakthrough curve expresses the total adsorbed metallic ions by the column which is referred as qtotal mg g and calculated by eq 13 37 13 q t o t a l q c o 1000 t 0 t t t o t a l 1 c e f f c o d t where 1 ceff c0 mg l is the surface area of upper space of exhausting concentration change vs time diagram which indicates the adsorbed metallic ion concentration and q ml min is flow rate that can be calculated by eq 14 where veff ml is input flow volume and ttotal min is the total time 14 q v e f f t t o t a l the total amount of transferred metallic ions mg from the column and the percent of metallic ion removal r according to flow volume were calculated by eqs 15 and 16 respectively 15 m t o t a l c o q t e 1000 16 r q t o t a l m t o t a l 100 where qtotal mg g and mtotal g are the total entered metallic ions to the column and the total adsorbed metallic ions respectively in addition adsorption equilibrium capacity qe mg g and metallic ion equilibrium concentration ce mg l can be calculated by eqs 17 and 18 respectively 17 q e q t o t a l m 18 c e m t o t a l q t o t a l v e f f 1000 where m g is adsorbent weight mass transfer zone mtz is a zone of the adsorption column which adsorbed the highest amount of metallic ions and by passing time this zone moves to the end of the column mtz can also be determined using exhaustion time and breakthrough time by eq 19 37 19 m t z l t e t b t e where l cm is height of adsorption column in the present study sigmaplot software and matlab software were employed to analyze the column data 2 4 2 column data modelling up to now several simple mathematical models were developed for expressing and analyzing the column status in laboratory scale in order to predict the industrial applications in this method thomas and yan models were used to characterize the optimum model for prediction of column dynamic behavior 30 thomas model is one of the most popular and useful models for expressing the performance of adsorption process in the column and prediction of breakthrough curve 32 thomas model is presented as eq 20 38 20 c e f f c o 1 1 exp k t q q t m c o v where c0 and ceff mg l are metallic ion concentration in the input and exhaustion flows respectively kth ml mg min is the maximum adsorption capacity which is predicted by thomas model m g is the amount of adsorbent in the column v ml is the volume of the exhausting solution and q ml min is flow intensity the data of thomas model can be obtained by drawing ceff c0 diagram vs time yan model is another practical correlation that could compensate the defects of thomas model including prediction of exhaustion concentration at t 0 and provide a better expression for breakthrough curve this model is expressed by eq 21 39 21 c e f f c o 1 1 q c o t q y m a where qy mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity which is estimated by yan model a is refractive index and t min is time 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical and chemical properties of the functionalized cnts 3 1 1 ft ir spectroscopy characterization of the functionalization groups on the surface of cnts were carried out by ft ir spectroscopy before and after the functionalization fig 2 reveals the ft ir spectra of the raw and functionalized cnts in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 presence of the peak at 3420 cm 1 was attributed to o h stretching vibration 40 the width and asymmetry of this peak represents the powerful hydrogen bonds that can lead to severe water adsorption on the surface of the hydrophilic adsorbent 41 so in the final adsorbent o h peak has a broader peak with respect to raw cnts the peaks at 2854 cm 1 and 2920 cm 1 were assigned to c h bonding 40 the observed peaks in the range of 467 630 cm 1 indicate the presence of fe o bond and confirm the existence of fe3o4 in the synthesized adsorbent 40 the detected peaks at 831 cm 1 42 1290 cm 1 43 1307 cm 1 42 1440 to 1620 cm 1 44 were correlated to aromatic rings of polydopamine moreover the peak of 1380 cm 1 was related to indole type units of the polydopamine structure 42 therefore the presence of 1570 cm 1 peak shows the presence cc bond 40 the peak at 1542 cm 1 was related to hn bond the peak at 1620 cm 1 reveals the existence of co bond 45 additionally the peaks at 1410 cm 1 27 and 1035 cm 1 were assigned to co stretching vibration 21 and finally the peak at 1126 cm 1 was related to c n stretching vibration 46 the intensity of these peaks in the ft ir spectra of swcnts fe3o4 pda synthesized adsorbent were higher than swcnts literature survey confirmed the presence of swcnts fe3o4 pda structure by the mentioned peaks in this study 3 1 2 sem observations in order to evaluate the morphology of the samples sem and tem analyses were employed sem micrographs for swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent at 15 kev are brought in fig 3 as it can be seen in the figure the synthesized adsorbent is apparent as tangled tubes with average size of 200 nm additionally fe3o4 and pda particles are deposited successfully on the surface of swcnts the important point here is the several bright points on the functionalized cnts which represents that cnts were more factionalized on the both ends 47 on the other side functionalized cnts grew larger in comparison with raw cnts and have network structure this means that the surface of functionalized cnts have been increased 48 3 1 3 tem observations tem micrographs were used to evaluate the nanostructure more precisely that are presented in fig 4 and shows swcnts fe3o4 pda structure it is evident that pda and fe3o4 particles are present on the surface of swcnts functionalized magnetic nanoparticles of fe3o4 are located heterogeneously on the surface and inner parts of the swcnts zhao et al 49 reported the functionalization of cnts with pda and by obtaining tem micrographs showed that cnts pda particles had a better distribution with respect to cnts and the diameter of cnts increased after treating by pda 3 1 4 eds and xrd analysis eds analysis is a semi quantative method for determination of present elements in the sample this method is based on interaction of electron source and the sample 50 eds spectra of swcnts fe3o4 pda nano adsorbent is shown in fig 5 as it was expected the nano adsorbent contained fe n o and c elements the surface of cnts contains certain numbers of oxygenated functional groups these groups provide reaction sites and as a holder for formation and growth of magnetic particles cnts are composed of c and o elements and after magnetizing fe is appeared on the surface of cnts 51 the presence of fe and o peaks can confirm the successful distribution of fe3o4 on the cnt surface in addition the existence of n peak approves the presence of pda on the cnts surfaces eds spectroscopy was used to determine the chemical composition of swcnts fe3o4 pda before and after the adsorption process 52 the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of swcnts fe3o4 pda nanocomposite is shown in fig 6 the peak at 43 02 was attributed to swcnt the peaks at 62 90 57 37 53 25 35 59 and 30 09 can be related to the crystalline structure of fe3o4 crystallites 53 the pattern was broadened due to the presence of pda on the surface of the fuctionalized nanoparticles 54 3 1 5 analysis of vibrational sample magnetometer vsm using the vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis the magnetic properties of the adsorbent samples can be evaluated magnetic properties of swcnts fe3o4 pda were tested at room temperature using a vibrating sample magnetometer device hysteresis loops were used to investigate the magnetic properties of the adsorbent 43 fig 7 displays the hysteresis loops and magnetic residual of swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent according to the hysteresis loop pattern the sample had the magnetic behavior of a soft magnetic and super paramagnetic material soft magnetic materials are easily magnetized by applying a low magnetic field and instantly lose their magnetic moment by cutting off the field the magnetic performance of the samples depends on the size of the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles 49 based on the experiments the adsorbent had a good dispersion in aqueous solutions in order to collect the adsorbent from aqueous media an external magnetic field was used the results revealed that magnetized cnts were easily collected from the solution in a few seconds this means that the magnetic properties of the new adsorbent is high enough for the rapid magnetic separation from the aqueous solution 3 2 hg adsorption in batch system 3 2 1 the effect of adsorbent dosage experiments were carried out to examine the effect of adsorbent dosage on hg ion adsorption which are presented in fig 8 as it is evident when the adsorbent dosage increased from 100 to 400 mg l in working volume 100 ml the percentage of hg removal increased while the equilibrium adsorption capacity the amount of metal adsorption per adsorbent unit decreased increase of hg ion removal can be due to more free adsorption sites and higher surface area of the adsorbent 55 56 on the other hand decrease of equilibrium adsorption capacity is due to remained unsaturated adsorption sites swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent was effective in removing hg from aqueous solutions because of ligands containing aromatic ring 57 58 oxidized cnts have more oxygen groups since oxygenated functional groups are high proton donor groups it leads to higher cationic exchange and electrostatic adsorption 59 researchers reported that hybrid nanoparticles of fe3o4 pda not only able to eliminate multiple contaminants hg cu ag methylene blue etc but also have high adsorption capacity moreover they have a great potential for purifying water with complicated components 43 surface area of magnetized adsorbent was slightly lower compared to raw cnts due to presence of magnetic particles on the cnts furthermore in acidic condition there is possibility of iron oxide removal from the adsorbent surface but it is not severe and does not affect the efficiency much 60 61 hence by coating the surface of swcnts fe3o4 with pda in this study the magnetic property was preserved and the efficiency increased since it is easy to separate the magnetized nano adsorbents by applying an external magnetic field it was preferred to use the mentioned nano adsorbent keeping an eye on the results and cost effectiveness of the process the optimum amount of the adsorbent was selected to be 200 mg l 3 2 2 effect of ph the ph of the media is an important factor in batch system adsorption because of its detrimental effects on the adsorbent surface and distribution of metallic ion species 21 ph is one of the controller parameters during adsorption since cation bonding to the surface active groups is strongly depended on surface charge of the particles 62 ph not only affects on the adsorbent surface sites but also have influence on chemical behavior of heavy metals thus ph effect on the hg adsorption trend by swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent in the range of ph 2 8 was investigated the results of this parameter is presented in fig 9 by increasing ph removing percent and equilibrium adsorption of hg increased solution ph affects the adsorption trend differently based on adsorbent type functional groups and surface charge 63 surface charge of nanoparticles at phs higher than 5 6 is negative while it is positive at phs lower than 5 6 64 hg adsorption studies for hg show that functional groups with high electronegativity such as oxygenated groups which are existed on the surface of swcnts can react with hg2 ions hg reaction with oxygenated functional groups is expressed by eq 22 23 and 24 65 22 2r oh hg2 r o hg o r 2h 23 r cooh hg2 r cooh hg 24 2hg2 3oh hg2 hg oh 2 hg oh it can be concluded from the reactions that ion exchange processes are accompanied with h i e two different surface reactions including formation of complex hg compounds and proton exchange occur proton exchange on the adsorbent surface causes reduction of hg adsorption on the other side oh ion plays an important role in consuming the h ion hence adsorption trend increased by increasing the ph however more increase in ph results in very high oh concentrations that causes the hg complex compound to form 65 in the same way hg oh 2 increased by increasing the ph so formation of hg hydroxides increases on the cnt surface at phs higher than 7 hg oh 3 and hg oh 4 complexes form which cannot be adsorbed by cnts because these complexes are water insoluble the reactions are summarized in eq 25 and eq 26 66 25 hg oh 2 oh hg oh 3 26 hg oh 3 oh hg oh 4 the reason for decrease of hg adsorption capacity in acidic phs is that the existed chloride in the solution forms many stable compounds such as hgcl2 hgcl3 and hgcl4 that reduce the hg adsorption 67 according to mentioned discussions ph 7 was selected as optimum for continuing the hg adsorption studies 3 2 3 effect of hg metallic ion concentration fig 10 displays the results of different hg concentrations effect on the removing percent and equilibrium capacity of swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent at optimum conditions based on the figure the highest and lowest hg removing percent were at 10 mg l and 50 mg l of hg ion concentration respectively also it was seen that by increasing the concentration of the hg adsorption capacity increased this may be due to increase of driving force caused by concentration gradient 68 in other hand saturation of active sites in high hg concentrations leading to decreas removal percen 69 moreover it is possible that by increasing the metallic ion concentration driving force creating between the hg ions prevents them from adsorbing by adsorbent 70 3 2 4 effect of temperature and adsorption thermodynamics solution temperature can affect the adsorption equilibrium capacity and adsorption efficiency by increasing the temperature from 15 to 45 c adsorption equilibrium capacity and hg adsorption efficiency reduced our finding revealed that hg removing percent decreased from 81 00 at 15 c to 51 29 at 45 c similarly hg adsorption equilibrium capacity reduced from 94 06 mg g at 15 c to 65 95 mg g at 45 c this reduction of adsorption is because suitable adsorption sites are highly active at low temperatures and by increasing the temperature their activity reduced 71 in order to study the thermodynamics of the hg adsorption by swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent linear diagram of ln kd vs 1 t is shown in fig 11 likewise the thermodynamic factors and correlation coefficients are brought in table 1 gibbs free energy δg was determined to be 7 50 6 93 6 35 and 5 78 kj mol at 15 25 35 and 45 c respectively δh and δs values were calculated as 24 25 kj mol and 0 058 j mol k respectively this trend indicates that low temperatures are beneficial for spontaneous hg adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent negative value of standard enthalpy represents the exothermic nature of the hg adsorption reaction by swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent in other words negative standard enthalpy implies that temperature increase had negative impact on hg adsorption and the adsorption was higher at lower temperatures negative value of this parameter indicates that high temperature during adsorption process causes low efficiency in solid liquid interphase on the other side the obtained negative value for δg represents the possibility of reaction occurrence and spontaneousness of hg adsorption process which decreases by temperature decrease however decrease in δg negative values indicates the high tendency of the reaction at low temperatures adsorption of solid materials is categorized to physical and chemical adsorption but the partition between these two categories is vague nevertheless physisorption is usually non specified and energy difference for physical adsorption is significantly lower than the chemical reactions generally δg of physisorption changes between 0 and 20 kj mol while in chemisorption δg changes in the range of 80 to 400 kj mol 72 based on isotherm models data it was seen that in this process both monolayer adsorption chemisorption and multilayer adsorption physisorption occurred from this point of view it can be assumed that hg adsorption was occurred by both physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms on the surface of swcnts fe3o4 pda low levels of δs standard entropy implies that no significant change took place in the disorder of the system and on contrary the negative value represents the tendency to lower disorder during the adsorption process 73 low disorder can occur due to release of the water molecules in the time of ion exchange reaction between metallic ion and surface of the adsorbent functional groups 23 the results of this study was consistent with saleh et al investigation in 2017 73 siva et al in 2015 74 and sun et al in 2015 40 3 2 5 adsorption isotherm equilibrium data which is known as adsorption isotherm explains how interactions of adsorbed material with adsorbent takes place and provide a deep realization of interaction nature 55 adsorption isotherm shows the essential physicochemical data to evaluate the capability of the process as a unified practice 41 to express the adsorption process several developed isotherm equations including langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich d r isotherms were used to determine the correlation of adsorption trend with isotherm models it is necessary to define the trend of qe vs ce for the solution isotherm studies for hg ion removal and experimental data plus fitness coefficients for adsorption isotherms are displayed in fig 12 and table 2 respectively results revealed that for hg ion r2 0 9987 in freundlich model that had a better consistency with adsorption trend the matching of data with freundlich isotherm confirms the formation of multilayer hg ion coated the external surface of the adsorbent 75 kf in table 2 is a constant which shows the adsorbing capacity of the adsorbent with theoretical value of 36 86 b constant in langmuir model is referred to bond formation energy during adsorption process and displays the capacity of the adsorbent for adsorbing hg ions that its theoretical value is 0 1127 therefore based on this theory freundlich model is more desirable for hg ion adsorption 1 n is an experimental constant which is related to driving force with the theoretical value of 0 53 that indicates the desirable adsorption of hg the maximum adsorption capacity predicted by langmuir model was 249 07 mg g that is approximately higher than values reported in some litratures table 3 3 2 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption is a physicochemical process that includes the mass transfer of adsorbed material from solution phase to adsorbent surface transfer behavior of adsorbed molecules is analyzed by different kinetical models kinetic is one of the key aspects in evaluation of adsorption as a unified process the time required for metallic adsorption can be determined by kinetic evaluation of equilibrium data 73 adsorption kinetic controls the equilibrium time and affects the adsorption mechanism 75 to finalize the investigations on kinetics describing the process the acquired data from this section was fitted into pseudo first order and pseudo second order models and parameters corresponding to these models in addition to their correlation coefficients are presented in table 4 the linear correlation between the parameters is shown in fig 13 pseudo first order equation surveys the occupation of adsorption sites with respect to unoccupied sites it also expresses the adsorption in solid solution systems based on solid adsorption capacity on the other hand pseudo second order equation is used for analyzing the chemical kinetics in liquid solutions 79 it also shows that chemisorption is the limiting step of the surface adsorption in this model adsorption process occurred due to physicochemical interactions between solid and solution phases 31 the most proper model for the experimental data was attained based on r2 correlation coefficient and by comparing the qe values experimental data revealed that r2 in pseudo first order model was very low for hg ions on contrary fitness of experimental data with pseudo second order model was suitable and r2 was higher thus pseudo second order model provided a better logical explanation for experimental data moreover the calculated equilibrium capacity qe cal of pseudo second order equation was closer to the experimental value qe exp this shows that experimental data were fitted accurately to pseudo second order equation and hg ion adsorption followed the pseudo second order model low values of k2 in pseudo second order model is also demonstrates that adsorption process quickly reaches the equilibrium in addition according to results by increasing the metallic ion concentration values of k2 constant shows decreasing trend it is because of fast occupation of active sites in the adsorbent by hg ions that leads to formation of metallic ion monolayer on the adsorbent surface 23 copello et al reported that based on pseudo second order kinetic model metallic ion adsorption on the active sites was at 1 2 stoichiometric ratio 80 table 4 displays that adsorption rate h typically increased by increasing the metal concentration from 10 to 30 mg l and decreased from 30 to 50 mg l of hg ion concentration 35 3 2 7 adsorption and desorption of hg in batch system desorption studies is one of the important factors in evaluation of efficiency and cost of the adsorption system 21 for desorption process solutions with low phs are used 81 the ability of swcnts fe3o4 pda for desorption of hg was inspected by 0 1 m solutions of hcl h2so4 hno3 hcl solution was selected as the most efficient acidic solution with 84 41 desorption efficiency then the experiment was repeated with 0 2 and 0 05 m concentration too according to the experiments the most optimum concentration for desorption was 0 2 m hcl solution with 118 91 efficiency fig 14 shows the adsorption and desorption cycles by 0 2 m hcl solution for 5 replicate experiments results showed that adsorption and desorption cycles were done continuously and hg adsorption after 5 cycles decreased from 118 91 to 64 75 swcnts fe3o4 pda nanocomposites for 3 sequence cycles shows desorption efficiency higher than 90 the highest reduction in desorption efficiency occurred between cycle 3 and 4 that reduced from 94 87 to 72 28 and then had a gradual decrease according to the results swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent not only had high adsorbing ability but also had a great adsorbing potential after 5 recovery cycles thus swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent can be reused that leads to cost effectiveness for adsorption process 3 3 column studies 3 3 1 effect of column height to characterize the effect of column height on the hg ii ion adsorption in continuous system experiments were done using 3 different columns with heights of 7 14 and 21 mm containing 0 06 0 12 and 0 18 g of swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent respectively fig 15 presents the breakthrough curves in different heights of fixed bed with constant input concentration of 30 mg l of hg ion and constant input flow rate of 2 ml min the parameters of breakthrough curves are summarized in table 5 as it can be seen in fig 15 the shape and slope of breakthrough curves is slightly varied for different heights in the figure it is evident that by increasing the column height the slope of breakthrough curve decreased which results in broadening of mtz 37 the slop increased by passing time and reaching the exhaustion time it is clear that by increasing the column height exhaustion time te and the metallic ion concentration in the effluent flow ceff increased 36 by reviewing the data from table 5 it can be concluded that by increasing the column height hg removal efficiency increased and hg adsorption equilibrium decreased by increase of removing efficiency and column height mtz area increased that causes to provide more active sites for adsorption 82 in addition increase of contact time between hg ions and adsorbent surface is one of the other reasons for increase of removing efficiency 23 3 3 2 effect of input flow rate the amount of solution input highly affects the column performance in continuous adsorption system and it is an important parameter for evaluation of adsorbent performance in treating wastewater in pilot or industrial scale 83 the effect of flow rate on the trend of hg ion adsorption in fixed bed column with different flow rates of 1 1 5 and 2 ml min in constant input concentration of 30 mg l and constant column height of 7 mm was examined breakthrough curves in different flow rates are presented in fig 16 and the parameters are brought in table 5 regarding the diagrams it can be understood that generally te and tb declined by increasing the solution flow rate from 1 to 2 ml min simultaneously the slopes of breakthrough curves increased the cause of this behavior is short contact time between hg ions and swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent in high flow rates 84 changes in slope of the breakthrough curve can also explained by mtz mass transfer fundamentals i e in high flow rates mtz increased that results in reduction of column saturation time and increase of breakthrough curve slope 83 by comparing the loading time for different flow rates it can be concluded that in lower flow rates the saturation time is prolonged since in lower flow rates the external mass transfer resistance increased on the adsorbent surface and retention time of adsorbed material increased in the column hence hg ions require longer times for diffusion into adsorbent porosities that results in higher efficiency 82 by comparing the qexp for different flow rates in table 5 it can be explained that by increasing the flow rate of hg solution qexp values reduced because by increasing the input flow rate metallic ions fail to reach the equilibrium so column activity time highly decreases 23 thus according to the results 1 ml min flow rate had the highest qexp and removing efficiency 3 3 3 effect of hg initial concentration in the input flow the effect of initial concentration of metallic ion in the input flow is one the restricting factors and basic parameters the initial concentration of metallic ions in the wastewater is important since in a specific adsorbent mass only a certain amount of metallic ion is adsorbed 83 fixed bed reactor experiments were done at 20 30 and 40 mg l concentrations to evaluate the effect of initial ions on the hg adsorbing trend in the column during these experiments other parameters such as bed height 7 mm and flow rate 2 ml min were kept constant effect of different concentrations of hg ions in the input flow is displayed in fig 17 and the calculated paramours are brought in table 5 according to the figure it can be observed that by increasing the hg ion concentration from 20 to 40 mg l te and tb were shortened and simultaneously breakthrough curve slopes increased furthermore by increasing hg ion concentration saturation time is accelerated 36 this indicates that the change in concentration gradient affects the saturation rate and saturation time 85 difference between metallic ion concentrations in aqueous solutions creates a driving force around the adsorbent this driving force causes the metallic ions to release from solution phase to the adsorbent surface which forms an axial distribution along the column 37 in this way by increasing the hg ion concentration from 20 to 40 mg l a high concentration gradient is created that improves the mtz length as it can be seen in table 5 by increasing hg concentration adsorption capacity increased adsorption capacity increase in high concentrations can be explained by high metallic ion transfer to the adsorbent surface in high concentration gradients that is due to distribution coefficient increase or quick increase in mass transfer coefficient 36 according to the table by increasing the hg ion concentration mtz and ce increased and hg ion removing percent r reduced reduction of hg ion removal by increasing the concentration in influent is due to that in lower concentrations all hg ions join the adsorbent free sites and causes increase in hg ion removal for this reason in high concentrations adsorbent active sites are saturated that reduces the metallic ion removal 82 i e all adsorbents contain limited active sites which is saturated in a certain concentration 83 according to the results the obtained removing percentage and adsorbing capacity of the column by experiments were lower than the ones from batch adsorption studies which can be a result of inadequate contact time between hg ions and the adsorbent in continuous system 3 3 4 modeling of fixed bed reactor successful and suitable design of an adsorbing column requires prediction of concentration change in effluent breakthrough curve which is possible by adsorption process modelling in this study to predict the breakthrough curve for hg adsorption on the swcnts fe3o4 pda surface experimental data obtained from fixed bed column experiments were analyzed using thomas and yan models as it is shown in figs 15 17 experimental breakthrough curves were fitted with thomas and yan models at different conditions and the predicted parameters by these models are listed in table 5 to compare the statistics and fitness of fixed bed column data with yan and thomas models r2 was calculated for both models comparison of r2 values in table 5 indicates that yan model was slightly more consistent with fixed bed experimental data compared to thomas model of course both models can be employed for prediction of hg ion adsorption in fixed bed column after comparing the maximum adsorption capacity for yan and thomas models it can be concluded that the predicted values of maximum adsorption capacity by thomas model qth had lower difference with the experimental value qexp in comparison with yan model that is to say thomas model can predict the maximum adsorption capacity qm better than yan model under these circumstances thomas model assumes that adsorption process follows the adsorption and desorption kinetic of langmuir 38 thomas model is more suitable because in this model slight axial dispersion is obtained in other words driving force is based on pseudo second order reversible reaction and it seems that the adsorption is not restricted by chemical reaction and it is controlled by mass transfer 83 shahbazi et al 37 sankararamakrishnan et al 86 rahmanzadeh et al 87 and foroughi dahr et al 88 reported that thomas model is suggests a good fitness with fixed bed column that approves the results of this investigation 4 conclusions the aim of this investigation was to study the efficiency of magnetized swcnts functionalized by polydopamine swcnts fe3o4 pda for removing hg from aqueous media in batch and continuous systems ft ir eds vsm sem and tem analyses confirmed the functionalization of the cnts it was found that functionalized swcnts by pda swcnts fe3o4 pda is a more suitable adsorbent and has a higher hg adsorption capacity in comparison with raw cnts in aqueous solutions the results of this study showed that the prepared adsorbent is more efficient at basic phs for removing hg in a way that ph 7 was found to be the optimum ph for hg adsorption and all the experiments were carried out at ph 7 since the adsorption process is highly depended on temperature thermodynamic studies revealed that temperature increase have negative impact on hg adsorption and removal of this contaminant is more favorable at low temperatures additionally it was discovered that hg adsorption on the swcnts fe3o4 pda surface is an exothermic and spontaneous reaction by fitting the experimental data and isotherm models it can be shown that hg ion adsorption is fitted by freundlich model with r2 99 87 in addition kinetic studies of hg adsorption on swcnts fe3o4 pda surface shows that pseudo second order equation is properly fitted with experimental data and this model can suitably represents the hg adsorption mechanism adsorption and desorption investigations revealed that hg adsorption declined from 118 91 to 64 75 after 5 cycles of adsorption desorption process thus the adsorbent can be recycled for subsequent uses hg adsorption studies in the continuous system displayed that hg adsorption percent in the fixed bed column of swcnts fe3o4 pda increased by decreasing the flow rate decreasing the metallic ion concentration and increasing the column height thomas model was found to predict a more accurate value for maximum adsorption capacity qm with respect to yan model thus it can be claimed that at optimum conditions magnetic swcnts functionalized by polydopamine can be used as a novel adsorbent for removing hg metallic ions from aqueous solutions with high efficiency funding this research did

14267,mercury is one of the most toxic and unnecessary elements for human body in a way that only slight amount of it can cause serious hygienic problems and environmental pollution in the present study magnetized single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts functionalized by polydopamine was employed for elimination of mercury heavy metal ions from aqueous media in order to characterize the physical and chemical properties of the swcnt and to confirm the functionalization steps different analyses including tem sem vsm eds ft ir were utilized in the present paper the effects of experimental parameters such as adsorbent dosage solution ph metallic ion initial concentration process thermodynamics and desorption mechanism on batch system were widely studied in addition mercury adsorption trend in continuous system was investigated by a fixed bed reactor comparison of adsorption process kinetics were done with models of freundlich langmuir and dubinin radushkevich in batch system and consistency with yan and thomas models in continuous system by sigma plot and matlab software packs isotherm studies and adsorption kinetics revealed that mercury ions follow freundlich adsorption isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model moreover thermodynamic studies showed that mercury ion adsorption is an exothermic and spontaneous reaction although thomas model was found to predict more exact results for maximum mercury ion adsorption both thomas and yan models had good fitness with fixed bed reactor data finally adsorption process demonstrated that removal efficiency of the prepared adsorbent was so much higher than raw swcnts keywords mercury adsorption kinetics thermodynamics polydopamine 1 introduction water pollution all around the world has been turned to a global crisis the quality of water sources gets critical day by day according to population growth rapid development of industries agricultural activities and other geometrical and environmental changes 1 continuous release of different contaminations such as heavy metals and organic compounds into the environment caused a serious global issue 2 removal of heavy and toxic metals from water is one of the most important environmental challenges which attracts high attention 3 lead pb cadmium cd and mercury hg among heavy metals are considered as high priority elements based on 2008 105 ec instruction by european union parliament and of european council on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy 4 mercury is a very toxic element that has high toxicity even in low doses 5 mercury is found in the form of elemental hg0 metallic hg ii and organic mehg in the nature all three forms of hg is toxic but metallic hg and organic hg have higher toxicity to living organisms 6 hg is a threat not only to human health but also to microorganisms plants and animals 7 hg has a very high tendency for biological accumulation bioconcentration in living organisms in addition to ability of transmission to higher levels of food pyramid in food chains by biological magnification biomagnification 5 methyl mercury is one of the forms of organic mercury which affects the nervous system in short time exposures and has negative effect on kidneys in long term exposures 8 lately investigations showed that methyl mercury also disturbs the pancreas and glucose metabolism performances 6 based on world health organization who instructions the allowed limit of hg content in water is 0 006 mg l 9 according to the mentioned restrictions hg and cd removal from aqueous solutions is vital for maintaining a healthy society so several methods have been used for elimination of heavy metals from water selecting a specific method is based on financial efficiency and level of heavy metal initial concentration 8 oxidation reduction reverse osmosis biofiltration electrodialysis coagulation and flocculation membrane filtration ion exchange and adsorption are considered as the most popular techniques for removing metal ions 10 11 all of the aforementioned techniques have their own restrictions and advantages where adsorption is considered as a beneficial and efficient method for filtering wastewaters the most significant advantages of adsorption in comparison with other methods are high efficiency low cost and possibility of metal recycling 12 additionally the so called adsorbents can be recycled and reused by desorption process 13 in recent years cnts were used for contamination removal from aqueous solutions due to high specific surface low density porous structure and high interaction with contaminants molecules 14 cnts do not react with most of the elements because of specific chemical structure therefor change in physical and chemical state of its surface is required for adsorption of metallic ions 8 nowadays achieving to an adsorbent including some characteristics such as environmental friendly economical preparation method using non toxic material high adsorption capacity renewability and stability is in superior according to these facts some synthetized adsorbents have been developed for mercury removal such as pd eda cs 15 swcnt sh 16 canps 17 mwcnts fe3o4 18 cmnc 19 and swcnts 20 lack of separation ability from the solutions in these adsorbents after the adsorbing process and development of secondary contaminations are the most significant restrictions of these adsorbents it seems that magnetic separation is the best alternative method to overcome these restrictions however more attempts are needed for expanding the practical applications of these materials in future 21 hence in the present study swcnts were first doped with magnetic particles then functionalized by polydopamine polydopamine is a non toxic biopolymer 22 containing hydroxyl and amine functional groups that are effective in divalent metal ions removal so integrated existing these functional groups and magnetic characteristics make this synthetized adsorbent suitable for mercury removal all in all it can be acknowledged that the purpose of this investigation is hg ion removal from aqueous solutions by swcnts which were functionalized by polydopamine furthermore the effect of experimental parameters such as adsorbent dosage ph metallic ion initial concentration thermodynamics and desorption on batch system were studied precisely on the other hand hg ion adsorption trend in continuous system using fixed bed reactor was evaluated the performance of adsorbing reactor with different variables of reactor height metallic ion initial concentration and input flow rate was investigated kinetics of the process and consistency of adsorption process in both batch and continuous systems were investigated 2

the ph hotplate magnetic stirrer ika germany and digital balance with precision of 0 001 g gf300 japan were also used 2 2 functionalizing of cnts 0 5 g swcnts was placed in a beaker containing 50 ml deionized water in ultrasonic homogenizer for 30 min the dispersed cnts were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper then cnts were added to 100 ml of 1 5 m naoh solution and stirred vigorously 0 5 g fecl2 4h2o and 1 3 g fecl3 6h2o were dissolved in 25 ml deionized water and deoxygenized after that 0 85 ml concentrated hcl was added to the solution and the resulted solution was added dropwise to the dispersed cnts under ultra sonication afterwards the mixture was separated by a powerful magnet and the obtained nanoparticles were washed 3 times by 200 ml deionized water the prepared nanoparticles were dried at 40 c which leaded to formation of swcnt fe3o4 1 g polydopamine was added to 1 g swcnt fe3o4 dispersed in 500 ml tris buffer 10 mm ph 8 5 and stirred for 24 h at ambient temperature after completion of the reaction obtaining swcnts fe3o4 pda the product was separated by a magnet washed with deionized water and ethanol and dried fig 1 represents the steps of cnts functionalization 2 3 batch adsorption experiments the adsorption of hg ii ion from aqueous solutions in batch system was carried out in a 250 ml beaker containing 100 ml of metal and adsorbent solution stirring at 200 rpm first the stock solution was prepared with 1000 mg l concentration and other required concentrations were made daily as fresh solutions by diluting with deionized water electrical conductivity 0 05 μs m for optimization of adsorption process first a certain amount of adsorbent was examined in constant conditions of ph metal initial concentration and room temperature 25 c after determination of optimum adsorbent amount the adsorption experiment was evaluated in different ph values in the following by changing the metallic ion initial concentration the effect of concentration on adsorption was studied and finally the effect of temperature on experimental condition was inspected in each set of experiments sampling was carried out after 5 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min then the solution containing metallic ion and the adsorbent was filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filter the concentration of hg in the solutions was measured via chromatography method using dithizone solution by uv vis spectrophotometer at 480 nm 23 in every experiment adsorption efficiency was calculated by eq 1 1 r 100 c 0 c e c 0 where c0 ce and r are initial concentration mg l equivalent concentration mg l and adsorption percent by the adsorbent in the metallic ion solution respectively in most of the previous studies the adsorbent efficiency was reported by hg adsorbing percent it is obvious that this term cannot represent a tangible adsorbing capacity because adsorbing percent is a relative parameter which is changing at different adsorbent dosage and metal initial concentration 24 for this purpose in order to attain an actual amount of adsorption capacity hg adsorbed ions per adsorbent dosage was calculated according to eq 2 2 q e v m c 0 c e where qe v m and c0 and ce are adsorption equivalent capacity mg g which shows the adsorbed hg ions per gram metallic solution volume l adsorbent amount g initial concentration and equivalent concentration respectively to study the metallic ion adsorption process in different conditions effective parameters including adsorbent dosage ph temperature and metallic ion concentration were inspected 2 3 1 the effect of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage on the hg removal efficiency was evaluated for 100 200 300 and 400 mg l of adsorbent in this investigation 100 ml of hg ii was separately prepared with 20 mg l metallic ion concentration in ph 7 for 60 min and transferred to a 250 ml flask then 100 400 mg l of the prepared adsorbents were added and the mixture was stirred at 200 rpm for 60 min as equivalent time 2 3 2 effect of ph the process of heavy metals adsorption is highly depended on ph of the solution to evaluate the effect of ph on adsorption process ph was adjusted to 2 4 6 7 and 8 by 0 1 m hcl and naoh solutions these experiments were carried out with 200 mg l adsorbent dosage and 20 mg l metallic ion concentration 2 3 3 effect of metallic ion concentration initial concentration of the pollutant is one of the factors that affects the adsorption efficiency to determine the effect of metallic ion concentration on process efficiency hg metallic ions concentrations of 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l was examined at ph 7 and 200 mg l adsorbent dosage during 60 min of contact time 2 3 4 effects of temperature and adsorption thermodynamics temperature is one of the other important parameters which affects the adsorption process to study the effect of temperature on adsorption hg adsorption process was investigated at 15 25 35 and 45 c temperature adjustment was done by shaker incubator other parameters of metal concentration adsorbent dosage and ph were kept constant as 20 mg l 200 mg l and 7 respectively evaluation of thermodynamic parameters requires the determination of distribution coefficient k which is temperature dependent this was calculated by eq 3 25 3 k d c c e c e v w where v l and w g are solution volume and adsorbent weight respectively other thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy δg0 enthalpy δh0 and entropy δs0 were determined using eqs 4 and 5 26 4 l n k d δs r δh r t 5 δg δh tδs where r is gas universal constant 8 314 j mol k and t is temperature k δh0 j mol and δs0 j mol k were obtained from the slope and y intercept of van hoff diagram by drawing ln kd vs 1 t respectively enthalpy represents the change of internal energy level of the solution during adsorption process that can explain the exothermic δh 0 or endothermic δh 0 nature of the reaction while entropy represents the increase or decrease of disorder in the adsorbing system 2 3 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption equivalent capacity is one of the most important parameters which can be assessed by isotherm studies 27 for this reason different concentrations of hg 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l were prepared other parameters of adsorbent dosage ph temperature stirring speed and time kept constant as 200 mg l 7 25 c 200 rpm and 60 min respectively in this study the consistency of adsorption process experimental data with langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models was studied in langmuir adsorption isotherm it is supposed that the adsorbed material only interacts with limited number of uniform adsorption sites and adsorption is restricted only to monolayer on the surface hence there is identical energy and enthalpy for every ion in a solution during the adsorption process langmuir isotherm is expressed as eq 6 28 6 q e q m b c e 1 b c e where qe is adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg g ce is equilibrium

distribution on a heterogeneous surface gaussian function distribution is exponential function with symmetrical bell shape diagram which is used for normal distribution and named after carl friedrich gauss the mathematician nonlinear form of dubinin radushkevich model is expressed as eq 9 23 8 q e q m exp k e 2 where e r t l n 1 1 c e or e 2 k 1 2 kj mol k is dubinin radushkevich isotherm constant mol kj 2 r is universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is temperature k 2 3 6 kinetic studies the experiment was carried out with 200 mg l adsorbent dosage ph 7 t 25 c and different hg concentrations of 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l kinetic models were used to determine the adsorption rate and possible mechanisms of process 31 pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models are models for adsorption reaction which were employed for determination of adsorption rate in the present study the pseudo first order model assumes that adsorption in the solution changes with time and correlates to changes of saturation concentration and adsorbent adsorption during time 32 this model was expressed by lagrange as eq 9 that is used for adsorption of solutes from a solution 29 9 l o g

first order model is applicable log qe qt vs t must have a linear relation where its slope and y intercept represents k1 and logqe respectively 33 pseudo second order kinetic model expressed the dependence of adsorption rate to adsorption capacity in the solid phase which is independent of adsorbed material 32 this model was suggested by ho in 1995 as eq 10 34 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are adsorbed material at equilibrium and t times mg g respectively while k2 is kinetic rate constant for pseudo second order model g mg min 29 if pseudo second order model is applicable

from eq 11 35 11 h k 2 q e 2 2 2 3 7 adsorption and desorption in batch system in this study 5 stages of adsorption and desorption of hg ii ion were investigated for the prepared adsorbents the adsorbents were washed twice by deionized water after the adsorption process and separated by centrifuge to select an acidic solution with high desorption efficiency 0 1 n of hcl h2so4 and hno3 were prepared and after that the most desirable acidic solution was tested in 0 2 and 0 05 n concentrations too therefore the most efficient acidic solution with the optimum concentration was determined adsorption process was carried out with 20 mg l concentration of hg ii 200 mg l adsorbent dosage ph 7 working volume of 50 ml and equilibrium time of 60 min after every stage the percent of removed hg ii and recovery percent were calculated by eq 12 12 m e t a l r e c o v e r y a m o u n t o f m e t a l i o n s d e s o r b e d a m o u n t o f m e t a l i o n s a d s o r b e d 100 2 4 adsorption in continuous system fixed bed reactor for characterization of adsorption in continuous system a fixed bed column in laboratory scale was prepared experiments were done using a glass fixed bed with 5 mm thickness and 20 cm height to reach the optimum conditions for removing hg ions parameters of solution flow rate adsorbent height and different concentrations of metallic ions were studied adsorption measurements were performed with column heights of 7 14 and 21 mm different flow rates of 1 1 5 and 2 ml min and different metallic ions concentrations of 20 30 and 40 mg l to do so first 0 06 g of the absorbent swcnts fe3o4 pda was poured into the glass column then the prepared adsorbent was fixed using 1 cm height glass wool in the bottom of the column in order to prevent the adsorbent exhaustion in addition to provide fine distribution of solution on the adsorbent surface and keeping the solution flow rate constant in this system the flow rate was adjusted by peristaltic pump using deionized water and then hg ii solution with different concentrations were pump into the column in upflow mode 2 4 1 column data analysis the change of effluent concentration to initial concentration from adsorbent bed vs time diagram represents breakthrough curve 23 breakthrough curves reveal the performance of the fixed bed column breakthrough time and the form of breakthrough curve are very important features for determination of performance and adsorption dynamic response when the concentration of metallic ions in the effluent ceff or ct reached to 0 1 of concentration of initial ions c0 breakthrough time equals to tb also when the concentration of the effluent ions reached to 95 of the initial ions it is referred as column exhaustion time te the breakthrough diagram is turned to s shape which is usually expressed by ct c0 as a function of time 36 the surrounding space in the upper side of the breakthrough curve expresses the total adsorbed metallic ions by the column which is referred as qtotal mg g and calculated by eq 13 37 13 q t o t a l q c o 1000 t 0 t t t o t a l 1 c e f f c o d t where 1 ceff c0 mg l is the surface area of upper space of exhausting concentration change vs time diagram which indicates the adsorbed metallic ion concentration and q ml min is flow rate that can be calculated by eq 14 where veff ml is input flow volume and ttotal min is the total time 14 q v e f f t t o t a l the total amount of transferred metallic ions mg from the column and the percent of metallic ion removal r according to flow volume were calculated by eqs 15 and 16 respectively 15 m t o t a l c o q t e 1000 16 r q t o t a l m t o t a l 100 where qtotal mg g and mtotal g are the total entered metallic ions to the column and the total adsorbed metallic ions respectively in addition adsorption equilibrium capacity qe mg g and metallic ion equilibrium concentration ce mg l can be calculated by eqs 17 and 18 respectively 17 q e q t o t a l m 18 c e m t o t

moves to the end of the column mtz can also be determined using exhaustion time and breakthrough time by eq 19 37 19 m t z l t e t b t e where l cm is height of adsorption column in the present study sigmaplot software and matlab software were employed to analyze the column data 2 4 2 column data modelling up to now several simple mathematical models were developed for expressing and analyzing the column status in laboratory scale in order to predict the industrial applications in this method thomas and yan models were used to characterize the optimum model for prediction of column dynamic behavior 30 thomas model is one of the most popular and useful models for expressing the performance of adsorption process in the column and prediction of breakthrough curve 32 thomas model is presented as eq 20 38 20 c e f f c o 1 1 exp k t q q t m c o v where c0 and ceff mg l are metallic ion concentration in the input and exhaustion flows respectively kth ml mg min is the maximum adsorption capacity which is predicted by thomas model m g is the amount of adsorbent in the column v ml is the volume of the exhausting solution and q ml min is flow intensity the data of thomas model can be obtained by drawing ceff c0 diagram vs time yan model is another practical correlation that could compensate the defects of thomas model including prediction of exhaustion concentration at t 0 and provide a better expression for breakthrough curve this model is expressed by eq 21 39 21 c e f f c o 1 1 q c o t q y m a where qy mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity which is estimated by yan model a is refractive index and t min is time 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical and chemical properties of the functionalized cnts 3 1 1 ft ir spectroscopy characterization of the functionalization groups on the surface of cnts were carried out by ft ir spectroscopy before and after the functionalization fig 2 reveals the ft ir spectra of the raw and functionalized cnts in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 presence of the peak at 3420 cm 1 was attributed to o h stretching vibration 40 the width and asymmetry of this peak represents the powerful hydrogen bonds that can lead to severe water adsorption on the surface of the hydrophilic adsorbent 41 so in the final adsorbent o h peak has a broader peak with respect to raw cnts the peaks at 2854 cm 1 and 2920 cm 1 were assigned to c h bonding 40 the observed peaks in the range of 467 630 cm 1 indicate the presence of fe o bond and confirm the existence of fe3o4 in the synthesized adsorbent 40 the detected peaks at 831 cm 1 42 1290 cm 1 43 1307 cm 1 42 1440 to 1620 cm 1 44 were correlated to aromatic rings of polydopamine moreover the peak of 1380 cm 1 was related to indole type units of the polydopamine structure 42 therefore the presence of 1570 cm 1 peak shows the presence cc bond 40 the peak at 1542 cm 1 was related to hn bond the peak at 1620 cm 1 reveals the existence of co bond 45 additionally the peaks at 1410 cm 1 27 and 1035 cm 1 were assigned to co stretching vibration 21 and finally the peak at 1126 cm 1 was related to c n stretching vibration 46 the intensity of these peaks in the ft ir spectra of swcnts fe3o4 pda synthesized adsorbent were higher than swcnts literature survey confirmed the presence of swcnts fe3o4 pda structure by the mentioned peaks in this study 3 1 2 sem observations in order to evaluate the morphology of the samples sem and tem analyses were employed sem micrographs for swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent at 15 kev are brought in fig 3 as it can be seen in the figure the synthesized adsorbent is apparent as tangled tubes with average size of 200 nm additionally fe3o4 and pda particles are deposited successfully on the surface of swcnts the important point here is the several bright points on the functionalized cnts which represents that cnts were more factionalized on the both ends 47 on the other side functionalized cnts grew larger in comparison with raw cnts and have network structure this means that the surface of functionalized cnts have been increased 48 3 1 3 tem observations tem micrographs were used to evaluate the nanostructure more precisely that are presented in fig 4 and shows swcnts fe3o4 pda structure it is evident that pda and fe3o4 particles are present on the surface of swcnts functionalized magnetic nanoparticles of fe3o4 are located heterogeneously on the surface and inner parts of the swcnts zhao et al 49 reported the functionalization of cnts with pda and by obtaining tem micrographs showed that cnts pda particles had a better distribution with respect to cnts and the diameter of cnts increased after treating by pda 3 1 4 eds and xrd analysis eds analysis is a semi quantative method for determination of present elements in the sample this method is based on interaction of electron source and the sample 50 eds spectra of swcnts fe3o4 pda nano adsorbent is shown in fig 5 as it was expected the nano adsorbent contained fe n o and c elements the surface of cnts contains certain numbers of oxygenated functional groups these groups provide reaction sites and as a holder for formation and growth of magnetic particles cnts are composed of c and o elements and after magnetizing fe is appeared on the surface of cnts 51 the presence of fe and o peaks can confirm the successful distribution of fe3o4 on the cnt surface in addition the existence of n peak approves the presence of pda on the cnts surfaces eds spectroscopy was used to determine the chemical composition of swcnts fe3o4 pda before and after the adsorption process 52 the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of swcnts fe3o4 pda nanocomposite is shown in fig 6 the peak at 43 02 was attributed to swcnt the peaks at 62 90 57 37 53 25 35 59 and 30 09 can be related to the crystalline structure of fe3o4 crystallites 53 the pattern was broadened due to the presence of pda on the surface of the fuctionalized nanoparticles 54 3 1 5 analysis of vibrational sample magnetometer vsm using the vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis the magnetic properties of the adsorbent samples can be evaluated magnetic properties of swcnts fe3o4 pda were tested at room temperature using a vibrating sample magnetometer device hysteresis loops were used to investigate the magnetic properties of the adsorbent 43 fig 7 displays the hysteresis loops and magnetic residual of swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent according to the hysteresis loop pattern the sample had the magnetic behavior of a soft magnetic and super paramagnetic material soft magnetic materials are easily magnetized by applying a low magnetic field and instantly lose their magnetic moment by cutting off the field the magnetic performance of the samples depends on the size of the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles 49 based on the experiments the adsorbent had a good dispersion in aqueous solutions in order to collect the adsorbent from aqueous media an external magnetic field was used the results revealed that magnetized cnts were easily collected from the solution in a few seconds this means that the magnetic properties of the new adsorbent is high enough for the rapid magnetic separation from the aqueous solution 3 2 hg adsorption in batch system 3 2 1 the effect of adsorbent dosage experiments were carried out to examine the effect of adsorbent dosage on hg ion adsorption which are presented in fig 8 as it is evident when the adsorbent dosage increased from 100 to 400 mg l in working volume 100 ml the percentage of hg removal increased while the equilibrium adsorption capacity the amount of metal adsorption per adsorbent unit decreased increase of hg ion removal can be due to more free adsorption sites and higher surface area of the adsorbent 55 56 on the other hand decrease of equilibrium adsorption capacity is due to remained unsaturated adsorption sites swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent was effective in removing hg from aqueous solutions because of ligands containing aromatic ring 57 58 oxidized cnts have more oxygen groups since oxygenated functional groups are high proton donor groups it leads to higher cationic exchange and electrostatic adsorption 59 researchers reported that hybrid nanoparticles of fe3o4 pda not only able to eliminate multiple contaminants hg cu ag methylene blue etc but also have high adsorption capacity moreover they have a great potential for purifying water with complicated components 43 surface area of magnetized adsorbent was slightly lower compared to raw cnts due to presence of magnetic particles on the cnts furthermore in acidic condition there is possibility of iron oxide removal from the adsorbent surface but it is not severe and does not affect the efficiency much 60 61 hence by coating the surface of swcnts fe3o4 with pda in this study the magnetic property was preserved and the efficiency increased since it is easy to separate the magnetized nano adsorbents by applying an external magnetic field it was preferred to use the mentioned nano adsorbent keeping an eye on the results and cost effectiveness of the process the optimum amount of the adsorbent was selected to be 200 mg l 3 2 2 effect of ph the ph of the media is an important factor in batch system adsorption because of its detrimental effects on the adsorbent surface and distribution of metallic ion species 21 ph is one of the controller parameters during adsorption since cation bonding to the surface active groups is strongly depended on surface charge of the particles 62 ph not only affects on the adsorbent surface sites but also have influence on chemical behavior of heavy metals thus ph effect on the hg adsorption trend by swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent in the range of ph 2 8 was investigated the results of this parameter is presented in fig 9 by increasing ph removing percent and equilibrium adsorption of hg increased solution ph affects the adsorption trend differently based on adsorbent type functional groups and surface charge 63 surface charge of nanoparticles at phs higher than 5 6 is negative while it is positive at phs lower than 5 6 64 hg adsorption studies for hg show that functional groups with high electronegativity such as oxygenated groups which are existed on the surface of swcnts can react with hg2 ions hg reaction with oxygenated functional groups is expressed by eq 22 23 and 24 65 22 2r oh hg2 r o hg o r 2h 23 r cooh hg2 r cooh hg 24 2hg2 3oh hg2 hg oh 2 hg oh it can be concluded from the reactions that ion exchange processes are accompanied with h i e two different surface reactions including formation of complex hg compounds and proton exchange occur proton exchange on the adsorbent surface causes reduction of hg adsorption on the other side oh ion plays an important role in consuming the h ion hence adsorption trend increased by increasing the ph however more increase in ph results in very high oh concentrations that causes the hg complex compound to form 65 in the same way hg oh 2 increased by increasing the ph so formation of hg hydroxides increases on the cnt surface at phs higher than 7 hg oh 3 and hg oh 4 complexes form which cannot be adsorbed by cnts because these complexes are water insoluble the reactions are summarized in eq 25 and eq 26 66 25 hg oh 2 oh hg oh 3 26 hg oh 3 oh hg oh 4 the reason for decrease of hg adsorption capacity in acidic phs is that the existed chloride in the solution forms many stable compounds such as hgcl2 hgcl3 and hgcl4 that reduce the hg adsorption 67 according to mentioned discussions ph 7 was selected as optimum for continuing the hg adsorption studies 3 2 3 effect of hg metallic ion concentration fig 10 displays the results of different hg concentrations effect on the removing percent and equilibrium capacity of swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent at optimum conditions based on the figure the highest and lowest hg removing percent were at 10 mg l and 50 mg l of hg ion concentration respectively also it was seen that by increasing the concentration of the hg adsorption capacity increased this may be due to increase of driving force caused by concentration gradient 68 in other hand saturation of active sites in high hg concentrations leading to decreas removal percen 69 moreover it is possible that by increasing the metallic ion concentration driving force creating between the hg ions prevents them from adsorbing by adsorbent 70 3 2 4 effect of temperature and adsorption thermodynamics solution temperature can affect the adsorption equilibrium capacity and adsorption efficiency by increasing the temperature from 15 to 45 c adsorption equilibrium capacity and hg adsorption efficiency reduced our finding revealed that hg removing percent decreased from 81 00 at 15 c to 51 29 at 45 c similarly hg adsorption equilibrium capacity reduced from 94 06 mg g at 15 c to 65 95 mg g at 45 c this reduction of adsorption is because suitable adsorption sites are highly active at low temperatures and by increasing the temperature their activity reduced 71 in order to study the thermodynamics of the hg adsorption by swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent linear diagram of ln kd vs 1 t is shown in fig 11 likewise the thermodynamic factors and correlation coefficients are brought in table 1 gibbs free energy δg was determined to be 7 50 6 93 6 35 and 5 78 kj mol at 15 25 35 and 45 c respectively δh and δs values were calculated as 24 25 kj mol and 0 058 j mol k respectively this trend indicates that low temperatures are beneficial for spontaneous hg adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent negative value of standard enthalpy represents the exothermic nature of the hg adsorption reaction by swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent in other words negative standard enthalpy implies that temperature increase had negative impact on hg adsorption and the adsorption was higher at lower temperatures negative value of this parameter indicates that high temperature during adsorption process causes low efficiency in solid liquid interphase on the other side the obtained negative value for δg represents the possibility of reaction occurrence and spontaneousness of hg adsorption process which decreases by temperature decrease however decrease in δg negative values indicates the high tendency of the reaction at low temperatures adsorption of solid materials is categorized to physical and chemical adsorption but the partition between these two categories is vague nevertheless physisorption is usually non specified and energy difference for physical adsorption is significantly lower than the chemical reactions generally δg of physisorption changes between 0 and 20 kj mol while in chemisorption δg changes in the range of 80 to 400 kj mol 72 based on isotherm models data it was seen that in this process both monolayer adsorption chemisorption and multilayer adsorption physisorption occurred from this point of view it can be assumed that hg adsorption was occurred by both physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms on the surface of swcnts fe3o4 pda low levels of δs standard entropy implies that no significant change took place in the disorder of the system and on contrary the negative value represents the tendency to lower disorder during the adsorption process 73 low disorder can occur due to release of the water molecules in the time of ion exchange reaction between metallic ion and surface of the adsorbent functional groups 23 the results of this study was consistent with saleh et al investigation in 2017 73 siva et al in 2015 74 and sun et al in 2015 40 3 2 5 adsorption isotherm equilibrium data which is known as adsorption isotherm explains how interactions of adsorbed material with adsorbent takes place and provide a deep realization of interaction nature 55 adsorption isotherm shows the essential physicochemical data to evaluate the capability of the process as a unified practice 41 to express the adsorption process several developed isotherm equations including langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich d r isotherms were used to determine the correlation of adsorption trend with isotherm models it is necessary to define the trend of qe vs ce for the solution isotherm studies for hg ion removal and experimental data plus fitness coefficients for adsorption isotherms are displayed in fig 12 and table 2 respectively results revealed that for hg ion r2 0 9987 in freundlich model that had a better consistency with adsorption trend the matching of data with freundlich isotherm confirms the formation of multilayer hg ion coated the external surface of the adsorbent 75 kf in table 2 is a constant which shows the adsorbing capacity of the adsorbent with theoretical value of 36 86 b constant in langmuir model is referred to bond formation energy during adsorption process and displays the capacity of the adsorbent for adsorbing hg ions that its theoretical value is 0 1127 therefore based on this theory freundlich model is more desirable for hg ion adsorption 1 n is an experimental constant which is related to driving force with the theoretical value of 0 53 that indicates the desirable adsorption of hg the maximum adsorption capacity predicted by langmuir model was 249 07 mg g that is approximately higher than values reported in some litratures table 3 3 2 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption is a physicochemical process that includes the mass transfer of adsorbed material from solution phase to adsorbent surface transfer behavior of adsorbed molecules is analyzed by different kinetical models kinetic is one of the key aspects in evaluation of adsorption as a unified process the time required for metallic adsorption can be determined by kinetic evaluation of equilibrium data 73 adsorption kinetic controls the equilibrium time and affects the adsorption mechanism 75 to finalize the investigations on kinetics describing the process the acquired data from this section was fitted into pseudo first order and pseudo second order models and parameters corresponding to these models in addition to their correlation coefficients are presented in table 4 the linear correlation between the parameters is shown in fig 13 pseudo first order equation surveys the occupation of adsorption sites with respect to unoccupied sites it also expresses the adsorption in solid solution systems based on solid adsorption capacity on the other hand pseudo second order equation is used for analyzing the chemical kinetics in liquid solutions 79 it also shows that chemisorption is the limiting step of the surface adsorption in this model adsorption process occurred due to physicochemical interactions between solid and solution phases 31 the most proper model for the experimental data was attained based on r2 correlation coefficient and by comparing the qe values experimental data revealed that r2 in pseudo first order model was very low for hg ions on contrary fitness of experimental data with pseudo second order model was suitable and r2 was higher thus pseudo second order model provided a better logical explanation for experimental data moreover the calculated equilibrium capacity qe cal of pseudo second order equation was closer to the experimental value qe exp this shows that experimental data were fitted accurately to pseudo second order equation and hg ion adsorption followed the pseudo second order model low values of k2 in pseudo second order model is also demonstrates that adsorption process quickly reaches the equilibrium in addition according to results by increasing the metallic ion concentration values of k2 constant shows decreasing trend it is because of fast occupation of active sites in the adsorbent by hg ions that leads to formation of metallic ion monolayer on the adsorbent surface 23 copello et al reported that based on pseudo second order kinetic model metallic ion adsorption on the active sites was at 1 2 stoichiometric ratio 80 table 4 displays that adsorption rate h typically increased by increasing the metal concentration from 10 to 30 mg l and decreased from 30 to 50 mg l of hg ion concentration 35 3 2 7 adsorption and desorption of hg in batch system desorption studies is one of the important factors in evaluation of efficiency and cost of the adsorption system 21 for desorption process solutions with low phs are used 81 the ability of swcnts fe3o4 pda for desorption of hg was inspected by 0 1 m solutions of hcl h2so4 hno3 hcl solution was selected as the most efficient acidic solution with 84 41 desorption efficiency then the experiment was repeated with 0 2 and 0 05 m concentration too according to the experiments the most optimum concentration for desorption was 0 2 m hcl solution with 118 91 efficiency fig 14 shows the adsorption and desorption cycles by 0 2 m hcl solution for 5 replicate experiments results showed that adsorption and desorption cycles were done continuously and hg adsorption after 5 cycles decreased from 118 91 to 64 75 swcnts fe3o4 pda nanocomposites for 3 sequence cycles shows desorption efficiency higher than 90 the highest reduction in desorption efficiency occurred between cycle 3 and 4 that reduced from 94 87 to 72 28 and then had a gradual decrease according to the results swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent not only had high adsorbing ability but also had a great adsorbing potential after 5 recovery cycles thus swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent can be reused that leads to cost effectiveness for adsorption process 3 3 column studies 3 3 1 effect of column height to characterize the effect of column height on the hg ii ion adsorption in continuous system experiments were done using 3 different columns with heights of 7 14 and 21 mm containing 0 06 0 12 and 0 18 g of swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent respectively fig 15 presents the breakthrough curves in different heights of fixed bed with constant input concentration of 30 mg l of hg ion and constant input flow rate of 2 ml min the parameters of breakthrough curves are summarized in table 5 as it can be seen in fig 15 the shape and slope of breakthrough curves is slightly varied for different heights in the figure it is evident that by increasing the column height the slope of breakthrough curve decreased which results in broadening of mtz 37 the slop increased by passing time and reaching the exhaustion time it is clear that by increasing the column height exhaustion time te and the metallic ion concentration in the effluent flow ceff increased 36 by reviewing the data from table 5 it can be concluded that by increasing the column height hg removal efficiency increased and hg adsorption equilibrium decreased by increase of removing efficiency and column height mtz area increased that causes to provide more active sites for adsorption 82 in addition increase of contact time between hg ions and adsorbent surface is one of the other reasons for increase of removing efficiency 23 3 3 2 effect of input flow rate the amount of solution input highly affects the column performance in continuous adsorption system and it is an important parameter for evaluation of adsorbent performance in treating wastewater in pilot or industrial scale 83 the effect of flow rate on the trend of hg ion adsorption in fixed bed column with different flow rates of 1 1 5 and 2 ml min in constant input concentration of 30 mg l and constant column height of 7 mm was examined breakthrough curves in different flow rates are presented in fig 16 and the parameters are brought in table 5 regarding the diagrams it can be understood that generally te and tb declined by increasing the solution flow rate from 1 to 2 ml min simultaneously the slopes of breakthrough curves increased the cause of this behavior is short contact time between hg ions and swcnts fe3o4 pda adsorbent in high flow rates 84 changes in slope of the breakthrough curve can also explained by mtz mass transfer fundamentals i e in high flow rates mtz increased that results in reduction of column saturation time and increase of breakthrough curve slope 83 by comparing the loading time for different flow rates it can be concluded that in lower flow rates the saturation time is prolonged since in lower flow rates the external mass transfer resistance increased on the adsorbent surface and retention time of adsorbed material increased in the column hence hg ions require longer times for diffusion into adsorbent porosities that results in higher efficiency 82 by comparing the qexp for different flow rates in table 5 it can be explained that by increasing the flow rate of hg solution qexp values reduced because by increasing the input flow rate metallic ions fail to reach the equilibrium so column activity time highly decreases 23 thus according to the results 1 ml min flow rate had the highest qexp and removing efficiency 3 3 3 effect of hg initial concentration in the input flow the effect of initial concentration of metallic ion in the input flow is one the restricting factors and basic parameters the initial concentration of metallic ions in the wastewater is important since in a specific adsorbent mass only a certain amount of metallic ion is adsorbed 83 fixed bed reactor experiments were done at 20 30 and 40 mg l concentrations to evaluate the effect of initial ions on the hg adsorbing trend in the column during these experiments other parameters such as bed height 7 mm and flow rate 2 ml min were kept constant effect of different concentrations of hg ions in the input flow is displayed in fig 17 and the calculated paramours are brought in table 5 according to the figure it can be observed that by increasing the hg ion concentration from 20 to 40 mg l te and tb were shortened and simultaneously breakthrough curve slopes increased furthermore by increasing hg ion concentration saturation time is accelerated 36 this indicates that the change in concentration gradient affects the saturation rate and saturation time 85 difference between metallic ion concentrations in aqueous solutions creates a driving force around the adsorbent this driving force causes the metallic ions to release from solution phase to the adsorbent surface which forms an axial distribution along the column 37 in this way by increasing the hg ion concentration from 20 to 40 mg l a high concentration gradient is created that improves the mtz length as it can be seen in table 5 by increasing hg concentration adsorption capacity increased adsorption capacity increase in high concentrations can be explained by high metallic ion transfer to the adsorbent surface in high concentration gradients that is due to distribution coefficient increase or quick increase in mass transfer coefficient 36 according to the table by increasing the hg ion concentration mtz and ce increased and hg ion removing percent r reduced reduction of hg ion removal by increasing the concentration in influent is due to that in lower concentrations all hg ions join the adsorbent free sites and causes increase in hg ion removal for this reason in high concentrations adsorbent active sites are saturated that reduces the metallic ion removal 82 i e all adsorbents contain limited active sites which is saturated in a certain concentration 83 according to the results the obtained removing percentage and adsorbing capacity of the column by experiments were lower than the ones from batch adsorption studies which can be a result of inadequate contact time between hg ions and the adsorbent in continuous system 3 3 4 modeling of fixed bed reactor successful and suitable design of an adsorbing column requires prediction of concentration change in effluent breakthrough curve which is possible by adsorption process modelling in this study to predict the breakthrough curve for hg adsorption on the swcnts fe3o4 pda surface experimental data obtained from fixed bed column experiments were analyzed using thomas and yan models as it is shown in figs 15 17 experimental breakthrough curves were fitted with thomas and yan models at different conditions and the predicted parameters by these models are listed in table 5 to compare the statistics and fitness of fixed bed column data with yan and thomas models r2 was calculated for both models comparison of r2 values in table 5 indicates that yan model was slightly more consistent with fixed bed experimental data compared to thomas model of course both models can be employed for prediction of hg ion adsorption in fixed bed column after comparing the maximum adsorption capacity for yan and thomas models it can be concluded that the predicted values of maximum adsorption capacity by thomas model qth had lower difference with the experimental value qexp in comparison with yan model that is to say thomas model can predict the maximum adsorption capacity qm better than yan model under these circumstances thomas model assumes that adsorption process follows the adsorption and desorption kinetic of langmuir 38 thomas model is more suitable because in this model slight axial dispersion is obtained in other words driving force is based on pseudo second order reversible reaction and it seems that the adsorption is not restricted by chemical reaction and it is controlled by mass transfer 83 shahbazi et al 37 sankararamakrishnan et al 86 rahmanzadeh et al 87 and foroughi dahr et al 88 reported that thomas model is suggests a good fitness with fixed bed column that approves the results of this investigation 4 conclusions the aim of this investigation was to study the efficiency of magnetized swcnts functionalized by polydopamine swcnts fe3o4 pda for removing hg from aqueous media in batch and continuous systems ft ir eds vsm sem and tem analyses confirmed the functionalization of the cnts it was found that functionalized swcnts by pda swcnts fe3o4 pda is a more suitable adsorbent and has a higher hg adsorption capacity in comparison with raw cnts in aqueous solutions the results of this study showed that the prepared adsorbent is more efficient at basic phs for removing hg in a way that ph 7 was found to be the optimum ph for hg adsorption and all the experiments were carried out at ph 7 since the adsorption process is highly depended on temperature thermodynamic studies revealed that temperature increase have negative impact on hg adsorption and removal of this contaminant is more favorable at low temperatures additionally it was discovered that hg adsorption on the swcnts fe3o4 pda surface is an exothermic and spontaneous reaction by fitting the experimental data and isotherm models it can be shown that hg ion adsorption is fitted by freundlich model with r2 99 87 in addition kinetic studies of hg adsorption on swcnts fe3o4 pda surface shows that pseudo second order equation is properly fitted with experimental data and this model can suitably represents the hg adsorption mechanism adsorption and desorption investigations revealed that hg adsorption declined from 118 91 to 64 75 after 5 cycles of adsorption desorption process thus the adsorbent can be recycled for subsequent uses hg adsorption studies in the continuous system displayed that hg adsorption percent in the fixed bed column of swcnts fe3o4 pda increased by decreasing the flow rate decreasing the metallic ion concentration and increasing the column height thomas model was found to predict a more accurate value for maximum adsorption capacity qm with respect to yan model thus it can be claimed that at optimum conditions magnetic swcnts functionalized by polydopamine can be used as a novel adsorbent for removing hg metallic ions from aqueous solutions with high efficiency funding this research did

defect band energy shift z scheme photocatalysis 1 introduction in recent decades the growth of industrials such as textiles plastics pharmaceutics and printing causes the environmental issues especially water pollution the organic pollutants from industrial waste are most toxic and carcinogenic which affect the human health water insufficiency has become the major problem to human because of overgrowth population in worldwide on the other hand lots of people uses the limited water sources that makes the water susceptible to water borne infection purification and reuse of waste water have the major issue to humanity in recent decades several purification methods have been employed for wastewater purification such as coagulation sedimentation flocculation ion exchange molecular sieves reverse osmosis membrane filtration chemical precipitation ozonation chlorination and chemical and electrochemical techniques however these purification methods are not cost effective energy efficient and inadequate for complete degradation of contaminant in wastewater among various purification techniques advanced oxidation process aop has paid much interest in the field of organic pollutant removal from waste water due to its more efficient and cost effectiveness aop is the process in which the organic pollutants removed by oxidize the organic waste by various processes such as ozonation photo fenton reaction ultra sonication and photocatalysis etc aop involves to produce the highly reactive hydroxyl free radicals oh to remove the organic pollutants from waste water by oxidation process among the various aops fenton reaction has gain much interest due to it produces the hydroxyl radicals from chemical oxidants o3 kmno4 h2o2 etc which has higher degradation efficiency and slug free operations the fenton reaction can be accelerated by the light source which is known as photo fenton reaction 1 3 this process does not create the post treatment sludge and not produce the secondary pollution furthermore aop process is not consumed the catalyst during the photocatalytic process and it can be reused by successive method 4 5 in recent years spinel structured binary metal oxide has great interest in the field of organic pollutant removal due to its spinel structure nature excellent chemical and thermal stability the spinel structure has the molecular formula ab2x4 where a and b are the divalent and trivalent cations placed in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of spinel structure besides x is either a chalcogenide or oxide among that spinel structures metal ferrite with formula mfe2o4 m divalent metal cations ni zn co mn and mg have been technological important to utilize the broad visible spectrum absorbed the more amount of visible light low energy gap and magnetic in nature the cubic spinel structured metal ferrites are soft magnetic nature except cofe2o4 which helps to magnetic separation application in photocatalysis process and easy to recycle zinc ferrite znfe2o4 is the class of spinel structured p type semiconductor the franklinite tetrahedral site occupied by zn2 and octahedral site occupied by fe3 ions 6 8 the zinc ferrite has a great attention in the field of photocatalytic dye degradation because of its low cost non toxic environmental friendly and good photochemical stability the znfe2o4 has narrow band gap of 1 9 ev which facilitates to absorb the wide visible light spectrum for photocatalytic organic pollutant removal the presence of fe3 ion in the zinc ferrite readily reacts with chemical oxidant to produce the free hydroxyl radicals which degrades the dye molecules the fe ion contain materials can enhance the photocatalytic activity by reduce the electron hole recombination 3 9 however low band gap energy leads to the fast recombination of photo excited electron hole pairs which limits the practical usage of bare znfe2o4 for photocatalysis process to overcome the drawback coupling of n type semiconductor with p type znfe2o4 to form the type ii p n heterojunction is the most promising route to supress the photo excited charge carrier recombination 10 11 the addition of zno and tio2 with zinc ferrite enhances the photocatalytic dye degradation process by supress the electron hole pairs by making heterojunction 12 14 the metal free polymeric semiconducting carbon nitride has a great important in the field of photocatalytic pollutant removal and energy production the polymeric melon carbon nitride first synthesised by berzelius in the year of 1834 the carbon nitride has five different faces namely α carbon nitride β c3n4 cubic c3n4 pseudo cubic carbon nitride and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 among these graphitic phase carbon nitride is the most stable allotrope form under ambient condition the graphitic carbon nitride contains only carbon and nitrogen in which the pi conjugated poly tri s triazines unit interconnected with ternary amine with no active basicity because of the deficiency of electron confined in the pi conjugated state the nitrogen linked triazine sp2 hybridised carbon and nitrogen to form the 2d layered structured material 15 16 the g c3n4 synthesised by poly condensation of nitrogen rich materials such as cyan amide dicyandiamide urea and melamine the presence of nitrogen in the carbon matrix deals the inimitable electronic structure with the moderate band gap of 2 7 ev which supports to consume the visible light of solar spectrum the nitrogen orbital has higher energy compared to oxygen which own the carbon nitride as a visible light response photocatalyst the covalent triazine unit can able to last at high temperature in presence of pure oxygen which makes the carbon nitride as auspicious photocatalyst with high chemical and physical stability 17 19 nevertheless the photocatalytic efficiency of bare g c3n4 constrained by low quantum efficiency low surface area and rapid recombination of photo induced charge carriers to overcome the disadvantages several strategies have been attempted to improve the efficiency of carbon nitride such as making mesoporous 20 doping 21 and make heterojunction with semiconductors 22 24 the addition of semiconductors such as ag bi2o3 v2o5 sno2 zno quantum dots and mos2 al2o3 was improved the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the g c3n4 under uv and visible light irradiation 25 28 in addition to this some recent novel carbon quantum dot cd supported g c3n4 and cd agcl supported g c3n4 heterojunction catalyst improved the photocatalytic degradation efficiency towards the organic pollutants under visible light irradiation 29 30 unfortunately the highly dispersed nature restricts the real world application of graphitic carbon nitride because of loss of catalyst during the recycling process 31 therefore to develop the heterojunction photocatalyst to active in the visible light region and separation of catalyst without any loss is the key point of the research interestingly to make the heterostructure between magnetic metal ferrites and graphitic carbon nitride is the promising candidate to improve the photocatalytic activity the heterojunction between magnetic materials and carbon nitride can effectively supress the photo excited electron hole pair recombination and helps to recover the catalyst after the photocatalytic reaction by external magnetic field several magnetic metal ferrites such as fe3o4 nife2o4 cofe2o4 cufe2o4 and znfe2o4 coupled with g c3n4 which improves the photocatalytic activity as well as recycling with external magnet without loss of catalyst 32 40 herein we report the simplest cost effective sol gel followed calcination process used to prepare the various amount of znfe2o4 intercalated g c3n4 p n heterojunction the photo fenton like degradation process of p nitrophenol and mixed dyes methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rh b under natural sunlight in presence of chemical oxidant were discussed best of our knowledge no works were related to the various concentration of zinc ferrite coupled g c3n4 for direct sunlight driven z scheme photo fenton phenol reduction and mixed dye degradation process has been reported the direct z scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was formed by the interfacial contact between two light active semiconductors in this solid state direct z scheme photocatalyst the electron hole pair separation occurs through the inter cross sectional electron transfer between the photocatalyst without any electron mediators or redox mediators under the light irradiation both the semiconductors generates the electron hole pairs the electrons on the conduction band of one semiconductor transfer to another semiconductor valance band via inter cross section of the heterojunction without any mediators which eliminated the photon shielding problem caused by the redox mediators and it leads to enhance the higher light absorption ability of the photocatalyst 41 the structural optical morphological and magnetic properties of as prepared catalyst were discussed in detail the nanocomposite shows the highest degradation efficiency compared to bare g c3n4 and pure znfe2o4 due to its synergistic effect and effective separation of photo induced electron hole pairs meanwhile the recycling process displays the stability of the as prepared

the as synthesised nanoparticles was analysed using powder x ray diffraction as shown in fig 1 from the xrd results it was clearly observed that the bare g c3n4 contains two peaks located at 13 41 and 27 69 corresponds to the planes 100 and 002 respectively the diffraction peak at 13 41 with the inter planar spacing d value of 0 659 nm indexed to in plane structural repeated tri s triazine unit the d space value of 0 321 nm suggests that the plane 002 assigned to graphitic interlayers 43 44 the xrd pattern of pure znfe2o4 confirmed that the fcc crystal structure with fd3m space group which is well matched with jcpds card 89 1011 the observed diffraction peaks at 18 20 30 03 35 28 36 88 42 86 53 25 56 79 62 23 and 73 50 indexed to 111 220 311 222 400 422 333 440 and 533 respectively 8 9 the pure phase of the znfe2o4 was confirmed by the absence of secondary phases such as fe2o3 or zno from the x ray diffraction pattern it was concluded that the peak intensity of znfe2o4 was increased while increasing the amount of zn and fe precursors meanwhile the intensity of the g c3n4 gets decreased with increasing the znfe2o4 intensity the result suggested that the incorporation of znfe2o4 reduces the polymerisation of carbon nitride and prove the guest host interaction between metal ions and the carbon nitride matrix 42 besides the peak shift also observed in the carbon nitride from 27 69 to 27 53 with increase the d space value of 0 321 to 0 323 nm which is shown in fig s1 a according to bragg s law the increasing inter planar distance between the planes 002 attributes to the slackened packing of conjugated graphitic system 43 44 in addition to this there is a peak shift has been observed in the znfe2o4 fig s1 b phase to lower 2theta which indicates the crystallinity of zfo affected by the g c3n4 matrixes the average crystallite size of the znfe2o4 and carbon nitride nanoparticles was calculated by debye scherrer s formula by taking the fwhm full width half maximum of plane 311 and 002 respectively the calculated average crystallite size of 22 nm and 5 nm attributed to the pure znfe2o4 and bare g c3n4 respectively the average crystallite size of nife2o4 nanoparticles in the composite reduced to 15 nm for 0 5 zfo g cn and 18 nm for 1 zfo g cn the increasing crystallite size of the 1 zfo g cn samples related to the growth of zfo crystal along 311 plane hence the decreasing the crystallite size of zinc ferrite and increasing the d value of g c3n4 reveals that the nanoparticles may be placed between the interlayer of conjugated aromatic layers 42 44 3 2 morphological studies the field emission scanning electron microscopic fesem images used to analyse the morphological nature of the prepared nanoparticles the fesem images of photocatalytic samples were demonstrated in fig 2 a c the pristine g c3n4 shows the lamellar sheet like structure whereas the pure znfe2o4 displays the highly agglomerated non uniform spherical like particles was appeared which has shown in fig 2a and 2b respectively from the fesem image of 0 5 zfo g cn it was clearly observed that the carbon nitride sheets were covered by the agglomerated magnetic znfe2o4 nanoparticles the weight and atomic percentage of the elements presents in the 0 5 zfo g cn nanocomposite photocatalyst was analysed by eds energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis and it was shown in fig s2 a from the fig s2 b it was detected that the agglomeration of zfo on g cn has been increased for the composite 2zfo g cn photocatalyst the deposited zfo nanoparticles on g cn nanosheets may produce the heterojunction both the xrd pattern and fesem analysis clearly indicates that the zfo nanoparticles produces the heterojunction with g cn nanosheets the heterojunction between zfo and g cn helps to improve the photocatalytic activity and benefits to suppress the excited electron hole recombination to further confirm the interaction between zinc ferrite and carbon nitride nanoparticles the transmission electron microscopy tem was carried out the tem image of the 0 5 zfo g cn nanocomposite was illustrated in fig 2 d the tem image demonstrated the zfo nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of the g cn nanosheets the average particles size of 15 5 nm was uniformly distributed on the surface of the carbon nitride nanosheets was appeared in tem image the crystallite size obtained from the xrd pattern is well coordinates with the measured particle size from tem analysis the interaction between sheet and nanoparticles are very strong which had confirmed by the ultra sonication treatment has been given to the composite for tem sample preparation the fig 2 e represents the high resolution tem image of nanocomposite the smooth and close contact area between g cn nanosheets and zfo nanoparticles were obviously detected from the hrtem image the fringes with the lattice space of 0 254 nm and 0 211 nm resembles the crystallographic plane 311 and 400 of cubic znfe2o4 nanoparticles correspondingly the lattice fringes were not detected for graphitic cn due to ultrathin layered structure 35 the fig 2 f clearly demonstrates the selected area electron diffraction pattern saed of the 0 5 zfo g cn nanocomposite it reflects the polycrystalline nature of the composite material grow with highly oriented planes which was well suited with the xrd diffraction pattern the tem images proposed that the zfo magnetic particles and g cn sheets form the heterojunction which facilitate to enhance the photocatalytic behaviour of the nanocomposite under light radiation and separate the electron hole in the opposite direction in order to produce the reactive species for dye degradation 3 3 optical study it is noteworthy that the utilization of solar spectrum by photocatalyst for oxidation reduction process on dye degradation process therefore the optical property of the nanocatalysts was evaluated by ultra violet diffused reflectance spectroscopy uv drs the diffused reflectance absorption spectra and tauc plot of the as synthesised photocatalysts are shown in the fig 3 and fig s3 respectively the bare g c3n4 shows the absorption edge of 445 nm with the band gap of 2 79 ev where the pure znfe2o4 nanoparticle shows the cut off wavelength of 650 nm with 1 89 ev energy gap and absorption tail extended to the near infrared region nir from the observation of stretched absorption tail in the nir region above 800 nm of pure znfe2o4 significantly improve the solar light utilization in the photocatalysis process the nanocomposites exhibit the strong absorption red shift in the visible light region compared to the g c3n4 the increasing the amount of zinc ferrite reinforce the absorption intensity of the nanocomposites and extend the absorption tail in the visible region the occurrence of absorption tail ascribed the electronic states located within the band gap of the nanocomposites as shown in fig 3 the absorption intensity of the 0 5 zfo g cn is quite higher than another nanocomposite which facilitates to absorb the more light from the solar spectrum from the xrd result it was detected that the increasing the lattice space of the carbon nitride describe the intercalation of zinc ferrite particles in the 002 plane of graphitic carbon nitride the presence of the nanoparticles inside the graphitic structure reflects the presence of shoulder peak in the uv vis absorption spectrum the shoulder peak in the region between 430 nm to 480 nm attributed to the presence of surface defects in the nanocomposites due to the interaction of znfe2o4 and g c3n4 45 the results from the xrd fesem hrtem and uv drs studies were confirmed that the heterojunction has been formed between the g c3n4 and znfe2o4 moreover the heterojunction between the zfo and g cn improved the visible light absorption of the as prepared composites due to the electronic coupling of semiconductors and it could confine the contact barrier 46 this result manifested that the composites could absorb the more light energy and were favourable for enhance the photocatalytic process 3 4 surface chemical compositional and vibrational study the x ray photo electron spectroscope xps study has conducted to empathise the electronic states interaction of elements and surface chemical composition of composite material 0 5 zfo g cn as shown in fig 4 the survey spectrum as displayed in fig 4a clearly elucidate the presence of carbon c nitrogen n zinc zn iron fe and oxygen o elements in the prepared nano photocatalyst the high resolution spectrum demonstrates that the electronic state of the elements present in the catalyst which is shown in fig 4 b f from the fig 4b it was clearly suggested that the two peaks located at the binding energy of 285 27 ev and 288 24 ev indicates the coordination between nitrogen and the carbon atom in the g c3n4 matrix the carbon 1s deconvoluted with another three peaks exposes the presence of interaction between carbon carbon atoms 284 52 ev and interaction between c and o 283 88 ev 287 50 ev the n 1s high resolution xps spectrum consists with three peaks positioned at 398 09 399 25 and 404 59 ev related to the pyridinic n ternary nitrogen in the repeated tri s triazine unit graphitic n sp2 hybridised nitrogen and oxidised nitrogen interaction between the oxygen from the zfo and the n in gcn the deconvoluted zn 2p high resolution spectrum from the fig 4d clearly expresses the presence of zn 2p3 2 and zn 2p1 2 peaks at the binding energy of 1022 16 ev and 1045 29 ev respectively the two peaks appeared in the zn 2p spectrum ascribed the existence of zn2 ion in the tetrahedral site of zinc ferrite the fe 2p high resolution xps spectrum exposes the two distinct peaks related to the fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 were displayed at 711 69 ev and 725 07 ev accordingly indeed the existence of fe3 ion at the octahedral site of the spinel structure confirmed by the xps high resolution spectra of fe 2p in addition with the satellite peak at 719 49 ev which has represented in the fig 4 e the o 1s xps high resolution spectrum deconvoluted with five predominant peaks the peaks with binding energy 529 83 ev and 533 01 ev correspond to the oxygen present in the spinel lattices the interaction between oxygen o2 atoms to zinc zn2 and iron fe3 atoms are associated with the peaks 530 72 ev and 532 23 ev the adsorbed hydroxyl group at the catalyst surface was assigned to the peak of 531 50 ev 47 51 indeed the intercalation of the zinc ferrite nanoparticles in the host matrix of g c3n4 was confirmed by the hrxps spectra of c 1s n 1s and o 1s hence the high resolution xps spectrum of the photocatalyst strongly unveiled that the interaction between heteroatoms produces the heterojunction between the zfo and g cn the heterojunction between the semiconductors leads to enhance the light absorption ability and increase the electron hole transportation to the redox process to understand of the vibrational properties of the chemical compositions present in the catalyst materials were investigated by ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscope the obtained ftir spectrum of the as prepared nanocatalysts was depicted in fig s4 the typical transmittance peak located at 804 cm 1 indicates the heptazine ring out of plane bending vibration of the g c3n4 the peaks located between 1200 1300 cm 1 denotes the c n c stretching vibration of the connected unit and peaks between 1400 1600 cm 1 specifies the stretching vibrational mode of repeated triazine unit the surface adsorbed water molecules peaks are located at the region of 3000 3400 cm 1 the peak present at the wavenumber 533 attributed to the metal oxygen stretching vibrational mode of the zfo nanoparticle both the composite photocatalyst materials consists with the above mentioned ftir peaks which suggests that the strong interaction between the g cn and zfo nanomaterials 38 40 3 5 magnetic properties the magnetic properties of the prepared nanoparticles are of the great interest in the process of recycling after the photocatalytic reaction the magnetic nature of the catalyst helps to recover the nanoparticles by external magnet without any loss the vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis has been conducted on prepared pure zfo and zfo g cn nanoparticles as shown in fig 5 the hysteresis loop of the catalyst obtained from the applied magnetic field swept from 15 koe to 15 koe at room temperature the acquired hysteresis loops of the materials are reflects the nanoaprticles are superpara magnetic nature with negligible coercity the magnetic saturation ms of the nanocomposites are found to be reduced compared to the pure zfo due to the coupling of nonmagnetic g cn the increasing the concentration of zfo on the g cn nanosheets has enlarges the magnetic saturation from the vsm results it could concluded that the prepared nancomposites used for recycling process by separate the particles using the external magnetic field this leads to the effective usage of the photocatalyst in the redox process 9 34 35 3 6 photocatalytic analysis the photo fenton catalytic performances of the as prepared bare and composite materials were investigated by degradation of mb and rh b mixed dye and 4 np in presence of oxidation agent h2o2 as depicted in fig 6 prior to the light irradiation the organic pollutants were ultra sonicated for 15 min with photocatalyst to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium and the values are shown in fig s7 the photolysis process of phenol without the catalyst and oxidation agent shows the stability of the pollutant under the experiment condition the degradation plot c c0 of 4 np against the time was shown in fig 6 a reveals that the composite photocatalyst shows the maximum degradation ability compared to pure znfe2o4 and bare g c3n4 among that 0 5 zf g cn composite degrade the 4 np up to 98 under direct sunlight after 50 min of irradiation compared with 0 5 zf g cn the 1 zf g cn composite shows the lower degradation efficiency which attributed to the higher amount of znfe2o4 loaded on the g c3n4 leads to charge carriers recombination from the fig s5 a one can conclude that the 4 np reduced to 4 ap amino phenol and the reduction of np was monitored by the intensity drop at 400 nm 52 53 the intensity of the 4 ap increases with drop of np peaks and the intensity around 300 nm reduced with increasing the irradiation time and finally disappeared the calculated phenol reduction efficiency of bare g c3n4 pure znfe2o4 0 5 zf g cn and 1 zf g cn samples was about 20 11 98 and 59 respectively the first order kinetic plot for phenol degradation was revealed that the composite of 0 5 zf g cn has the kinetic rate of 0 49935 min 1 which is 17 times higher than the 1 zf g cn 0 02876 min 1 composite the apparent kinetic rate constant of bare g cn and pure zfo was 0 00376 min 1 and 0 000380 min 1 respectively the photocatalysts were also subjected to mixed dye degradation under the same procedure as for phenol degradation it is evident from the fig 6 b both the composite catalysts exhibits the better dye degradation compared to pristine nanoparticles due to the interfacial contact between nanoparticles results the synergistic effect in the mixed dye solution the degradation range of mb is quite higher than rh b under sunlight illumination with the aid of h2o2 the maximum mb degradation attains 100 under the sunlight irradiation within 35 min while rh b degradation reaches 92 after 35 min in presence of h2o2 as expressed in fig s5 b the 0 5 zf g cn composite catalyst displays more efficient than pure nanomaterials and 1 zf g cn composite the decreased efficiency of the 1 zf g cn composite reveals the larger the particles size of znfe2o4 in the composite which was confirmed by the xrd analysis the pseudo first order kinetic for mixed dye removal was plotted by ln c c0 against the time has shown in fig 6 d the calculated rate constant for 0 5 zf g cn composite was 0 14376 min 1 and 0 34943 min 1 for mb and rh b respectively compared to this 1 zf g cn catalyst shows the rate constant 3 times and 9 folds inferior for mb and rh b dye degradation the observed kinetic rate constant for pristine g c3n4 and znfe2o4 was around 0 00608 0 00188 min 1 and 0 00168 0 00363 min 1 for mb and rh b the calculated degradation efficiency of the mb in the mixed dye solution was about 21 10 and 71 for bare g cn zfo and 1 zf g cn accordingly the rh b degradation efficiency of the pure g c3n4 znfe2o4 and 1 zf g cn composite was 15 6 and 44 respectively in addition to this the photocatalytic process was conducted under solar light irradiation in absence of oxidation agent and it was tabulated in table 1 the obtained results clearly demonstrated that the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst shows very low without the h2o2 this result clearly revealed that the as prepared nanophotocatalysts have the insufficient band potential for produce the hydroxyl reactive radicals for photocatalytic degradation process the obtained results clearly demonstrated that the as prepared photocatalyst has photo fenton like degradation behaviour towards organic pollutant removal furthermore the degradation ability of the as synthesised composite photocatalyst was compared to the other heterojunction photocatalyst and the results are tabulated as shown in table 2 in order to investigate the active radicals for degradation process the elemental trapping test has been conducted on rh b with different radical hunters in typical 1 mmol of edta and bq and 3 ml of ipa was added along with the dye solution under the light illumination for radicals trapping from the fig 7 a one can accomplish that the degradation efficiency of the rh b greatly affected by the super oxide bq and hydroxyl radical ipa scavengers the addition of edta does not alter the rh b degradation efficiency the added bq and ipa significantly reduce the degradation efficiency to 39 and 65 respectively the 96 and 94 of dye degradation was attributed to blank and edta samples the above results indicates that the addition of edta improve the degradation ability of the photocatalyst which is very close to the literature reports 54 when visible light was illuminated on the photocatalyst large amount of electron hole pairs were produced and it generates the large amount of superoxide radicals which contribute to the dye degradation process when bq was added to the photocatalyst system the superoxide radicals are captured and hence the degradation efficiency was reduced significantly on the other hand the hydroxyl radicals are scavenged by addition of ipa to the solution system and it leads to the lower degradation efficiency under the visible light irradiation the electron hole pairs are generated at the surface of the photocatalyst the photo excited electron can recombine to the valance band holes through direct recombination and surface recombination when edta was added to the photocatalyst system the holes are trapped by the scavenger at the same time large amount of photo excited electrons are migrated at the surface of the photocatalyst these electrons are produces the superoxide radicals either by react with the surface adsorbed oxygen at the catalyst surface or dissolved oxygen from the water these migrated electrons are generates the large number of superoxide radicals when edta was added into the solution and it could increase the degradation efficiency of the dye solution under visible light irradiation 54 it is obvious from the scavengers experiment clearly demonstrate that the oh and o2 radicals are the main reactive species for degradation process furthermore the possible reaction mechanism for dye degradation process was described from the elemental trapping experiment the conduction band and valance band potential of the as synthesised nanoparticles are estimated using the following formula 24 evb χ ee 0 5 eg ecb evb eg where ecb and evb denote the energy of conduction band and valance band respectively ee represent the free electron energy in hydrogen scale 4 5 ev and χ be the electronegativity value the calculated electronegativity value of g c3n4 and znfe2o4 was 4 7 and 5 8 ev respectively the bandgap energy was 2 79 ev and 1 89 ev corresponds to the pristine g c3n4 and pure znfe2o4 the estimated ecb and evb of pristine g c3n4 and pure znfe2o4 nanoparticles are 1 19 ev 1 60 ev and 0 27 ev 2 16 ev respectively but the uv drs absorption spectra of 0 5 zf g cn composite shows the two absorption peak related to g c3n4 and znfe2o4 the tauc plot of the composite exhibits the band gap of 2 64 ev for g c3n4 and 2 ev for znfe2o4 nanoparticles compared with pure nanoparticles the carbon nitride in composite shows the redshift and zfo shows the blue shift these results suggest that the new conduction energy state create due to the defect while making the heterojunction which is well matched with obtained xrd and uv drs results 10 the new surface defect produced conduction band energy for g cn and zfo nanoparticles was 1 04 ev and 0 16 ev respectively the predicted insight mechanism for photocatalytic degradation process as follow when photon is incident on the surface of the catalyst the electrons at valance state get excited and transferred to conduction state the photo excited electrons are accumulating on the conduction energy level of p type zfo due to the higher negative energy of n type g cn compared to znfe2o4 while the valance band holes are transferred to valance state of the g c3n4 the reduction process takes place at the conduction band of the g cn due to the comparatively high negative energy 1 04 ev than standard reduction potential 0 33 ev on the other hand the oxidation process occurred at the valance band of the znfe2o4 due to the high positive energy 2 16 ev compared with standard oxidation potential 1 99 ev 24 the conduction band of the zfo and valance band of the g cn does not contribute any redox process because the lower potential than standard redox energy the p n heterojunction formation causes the down bend in g c3n4 conduction energy level and up bend at the conduction band of the zfo 10 from the elemental trapping experiment it was found that though holes at valance level of zfo have higher potential energy than standard oxidation energy it does not affect the degradation process in addition to this the holes accumulated at the valance energy level of g cn could not produce the radicals for dye oxidation process but the superoxide o2 and hydroxyl oh radicals only contribute on photocatalytic process however super oxide radicals are the major active species for the dye degradation activity from the above mentioned results the boosted photocatalytic activity of the 0 5 zf g cn composite demonstrated by z scheme degradation mechanism 24 the photo excited electron from the znfe2o4 has trapped by the valance band of the g c3n4 the recombined electrons at the valance energy level of the g cn excite by incident photons the electrons at the conduction band are readily reacts with the atmospheric oxygen and it produces the o2 radicals the oxidation agent reacts with superoxide radicals and it produces the hydroxyl active species the organic pollutants get reduced by react with the hydroxyl radicals the produced photo excited electrons are captured by the electron acceptor for the reduction process and it affects the charge carrier recombination hence the p n heterojunction between the zfo and g cn produces the solid state z scheme process for effective separation of charge carrier and enriched photocatalytic degradation process the proposed possible reaction mechanism for organic pollutant removal as follows znfe2o4 g c3n4 h ν znfe2o4 h e g c3n4 h e o2 e o2 o2 h2o2 oh oh oh dye h2o co2 in photo fenton process iron fe based nanoparticles creates the highly reactive hydroxyl oh radicals for photocatalytic reaction the degradation efficiency of the photo fenton reaction is many times higher than the classical fenton reaction because of the fast conversion of iron3 into iron2 in znfe2o4 nanomaterials in typical photo fenton catalytic process the fe2 react with oxidation agents h2o2 to produce the highly reactive oh radicals and it destroy the organic dye molecule with the release of co2 and h2o the photo fenton reaction and photocatalytic process takes place together in the iron based materials while irradiation of visible light the photo excited electrons and holes transfer to the opposite direction in the photocatalyst the conduction band electron at the znfe2o4 reacts with h2o2 and it produces the hydroxyl radicals on the other hand the fe3 produces the oh radicals which oxidize the dye molecules in addition to the photo fenton reaction the self redox process also takes place in znfe2o4 in which fe induce the oxidation agent h2o2 to generate the oh radicals the self redox and photo fenton reaction as follows 55 56 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh fe3 h2o2 fe2 ooh h fe3 e fe2 h2o2 e oh oh oh dye co2 h2o 3 7 surface area analysis the textural property of the as prepared photocatalysts was inspected by bet brunauer emmett teller analysis was shown in fig 9 the obtained nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm curve for all samples clearly indicates the type iv with h3 hysteresis loop the calculated specific surface area of the bare g c3n4 and pure znfe2o4 nanoparticles was around 15 14 and 24 78 m2 g respectively compared with the pure nanoparticles the as synthesised 0 5 zfo g cn photocatalyst shows higher specific surface area of about 82 67 m2 g the higher specific surface area of the nanocatalyst aids to improve the adsorption ability which supports to the higher degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst under light irradiation the larger specific surface area of the composite photocatalyst not only improves the adsorption ability but also facilitate to enhance the charge carrier separation capability 22 3 8 charge carriers separation test in order to confirm the photo induced charge carrier separation and transport behaviour was studied by photoluminescence analysis and transient photocurrent measurements were carried out and it was depicted in fig 10 the pl spectra of the samples were recorded by exciting the photocatalyst by 400 nm at room temperature as can be seen in the fig 10 a it can be clearly noted that the emission peak of around 450 nm for the pristine g cn photocatalyst shows the high intensity the pl intensity was in the order of g cn 1 zfo g cn 0 5 zfo g cn zfo the photoluminescence intensity reduction of the 0 5 zfo g cn indicates that the composite has much lower charge carrier recombination rate compared to other photocataysts 22 further to confirm the charge separation behaviour of the as prepared photocatalyst was investigated by photocurrent measurements the generation of photocurrent with good reproducibility for the nanocatalysts was experimental through five on off cycles this specifies that the electrode is stable and photocurrent is quite reversible the 0 5 zfo g cn composite photocatalyst shows the higher photocurrent compared to the other nanocatalysts which demonstrate that the high effectual separation of photo induced electrons and holes by the composite photocatalyst 21 the pl and photocurrent results clearly validate that the 0 5 zfo g cn nanocomposite as an efficient photocatalyst towards organic pollutant removal with high light induced charge carrier separation 3 9 reuse and stability test the retrieval and cycle test is the key factor to use the catalyst for practical application the stability of the as prepared catalyst was evaluated by 4 np degradation for 4 successive cycles after the each cycle the photocatalyst was recovered by external magnetic field and washed with de ionized water for several time to remove the surface adsorbed pollutant the cycling stability of the sample was displayed in fig 9 a the 0 5 zf g cn retains 90 of stability even at the 4th cycle further to confirm the stability of the as prepared catalyst the xrd pattern was obtained after 4th cycle it shows that there is no structural changes appeared in the xrd pattern this result clearly shows that the prepared photocatalyst could useful for organic pollutant removal for practical use 4 conclusion in summary the effective photocatalyst for phenol and dye degradation was successfully synthesized by facile sol gel process the prepared composite catalyst shows the defect band below the conduction energy level which is verified by uv drs the p n heterojunction formation effectively reduces the recombination of electron hole during the photocatalysis process the 0 5 zf g cn composite shows the best degradation ability compared with pure and other composite materials the enhanced photocatalytic reaction mainly attributed to synergistic effect of interface between the g cn and zfo nanoparticles the photo fenton like degradation process shows the super oxide are the main active species for redox process and oh radicals also contribute on degradation activity the elemental trapping experiment reveals the z scheme could effectively

defect band energy shift z scheme photocatalysis 1 introduction in recent decades the growth of industrials such as textiles plastics pharmaceutics and printing causes the environmental issues especially water pollution the organic pollutants from industrial waste are most toxic and carcinogenic which affect the human health water insufficiency has become the major problem to human because of overgrowth population in worldwide on the other hand lots of people uses the limited water sources that makes the water susceptible to water borne infection purification and reuse of waste water have the major issue to humanity in recent decades several purification methods have been employed for wastewater purification such as coagulation sedimentation flocculation ion exchange molecular sieves reverse osmosis membrane filtration chemical precipitation ozonation chlorination and chemical and electrochemical techniques however these purification methods are not cost effective energy efficient and inadequate for complete degradation of contaminant in wastewater among various purification techniques advanced oxidation process aop has paid much interest in the field of organic pollutant removal from waste water due to its more efficient and cost effectiveness aop is the process in which the organic pollutants removed by oxidize the organic waste by various processes such as ozonation photo fenton reaction ultra sonication and photocatalysis etc aop involves to produce the highly reactive hydroxyl free radicals oh to remove the organic pollutants from waste water by oxidation process among the various aops fenton reaction has gain much interest due to it produces the hydroxyl radicals from chemical oxidants o3 kmno4 h2o2 etc which has higher degradation efficiency and slug free operations the fenton reaction can be accelerated by the light source which is known as photo fenton reaction 1 3 this process does not create the post treatment sludge and not produce the secondary pollution furthermore aop process is not consumed the catalyst during the photocatalytic process and it can be reused by successive method 4 5 in recent years spinel structured binary metal oxide has great interest in the field of organic pollutant removal due to its spinel structure nature excellent chemical and thermal stability the spinel structure has the molecular formula ab2x4 where a and b are the divalent and trivalent cations placed in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of spinel structure besides x is either a chalcogenide or oxide among that spinel structures metal ferrite with formula mfe2o4 m divalent metal cations ni zn co mn and mg have been technological important to utilize the broad visible spectrum absorbed the more amount of visible light low energy gap and magnetic in nature the cubic spinel structured metal ferrites are soft magnetic nature except cofe2o4 which helps to magnetic separation application in photocatalysis process and easy to recycle zinc ferrite znfe2o4 is the class of spinel structured p type semiconductor the franklinite tetrahedral site occupied by zn2 and octahedral site occupied by fe3 ions 6 8 the zinc ferrite has a great attention in the field of photocatalytic dye degradation because of its low cost non toxic environmental friendly and good photochemical stability the znfe2o4 has narrow band gap of 1 9 ev which facilitates to absorb the wide visible light spectrum for photocatalytic organic pollutant removal the presence of fe3 ion in the zinc ferrite readily reacts with chemical oxidant to produce the free hydroxyl radicals which degrades the dye molecules the fe ion contain materials can enhance the photocatalytic activity by reduce the electron hole recombination 3 9 however low band gap energy leads to the fast recombination of photo excited electron hole pairs which limits the practical usage of bare znfe2o4 for photocatalysis process to overcome the drawback coupling of n type semiconductor with p type znfe2o4 to form the type ii p n heterojunction is the most promising route to supress the photo excited charge carrier recombination 10 11 the addition of zno and tio2 with zinc ferrite enhances the photocatalytic dye degradation process by supress the electron hole pairs by making heterojunction 12 14 the metal free polymeric semiconducting carbon nitride has a great important in the field of photocatalytic pollutant removal and energy production the polymeric melon carbon nitride first synthesised by berzelius in the year of 1834 the carbon nitride has five different faces namely α carbon nitride β c3n4 cubic c3n4 pseudo cubic carbon nitride and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 among these graphitic phase carbon nitride is the most stable allotrope form under ambient condition the graphitic carbon nitride contains only carbon and nitrogen in which the pi conjugated poly tri s triazines unit interconnected with ternary amine with no active basicity because of the deficiency of electron confined in the pi conjugated state the nitrogen linked triazine sp2 hybridised carbon and nitrogen to form the 2d layered structured material 15 16 the g c3n4 synthesised by poly condensation of nitrogen rich materials such as cyan amide dicyandiamide urea and melamine the presence of nitrogen in the carbon matrix deals the inimitable electronic structure with the moderate band gap of 2 7 ev which supports to consume the visible light of solar spectrum the nitrogen orbital has higher energy compared to oxygen which own the carbon nitride as a visible light response photocatalyst the covalent triazine unit can able to last at high temperature in presence of pure oxygen which makes the carbon nitride as auspicious photocatalyst with high chemical and physical stability 17 19 nevertheless the photocatalytic efficiency of bare g c3n4 constrained by low quantum efficiency low surface area and rapid recombination of photo induced charge carriers to overcome the disadvantages several strategies have been attempted to improve the efficiency of carbon nitride such as making mesoporous 20 doping 21 and make heterojunction with semiconductors 22 24 the addition of semiconductors such as ag bi2o3 v2o5 sno2 zno quantum dots and mos2 al2o3 was improved the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the g c3n4 under uv and visible light irradiation 25 28 in addition to this some recent novel carbon quantum dot cd supported g c3n4 and cd agcl supported g c3n4 heterojunction catalyst improved the photocatalytic degradation efficiency towards the organic pollutants under visible light irradiation 29 30 unfortunately the highly dispersed nature restricts the real world application of graphitic carbon nitride because of loss of catalyst during the recycling process 31 therefore to develop the heterojunction photocatalyst to active in the visible light region and separation of catalyst without any loss is the key point of the research interestingly to make the heterostructure between magnetic metal ferrites and graphitic carbon nitride is the promising candidate to improve the photocatalytic activity the heterojunction between magnetic materials and carbon nitride can effectively supress the photo excited electron hole pair recombination and helps to recover the catalyst after the photocatalytic reaction by external magnetic field several magnetic metal ferrites such as fe3o4 nife2o4 cofe2o4 cufe2o4 and znfe2o4 coupled with g c3n4 which improves the photocatalytic activity as well as recycling with external magnet without loss of catalyst 32 40 herein we report the simplest cost effective sol gel followed calcination process used to prepare the various amount of znfe2o4 intercalated g c3n4 p n heterojunction the photo fenton like degradation process of p nitrophenol and mixed dyes methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rh b under natural sunlight in presence of chemical oxidant were discussed best of our knowledge no works were related to the various concentration of zinc ferrite coupled g c3n4 for direct sunlight driven z scheme photo fenton phenol reduction and mixed dye degradation process has been reported the direct z scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was formed by the interfacial contact between two light active semiconductors in this solid state direct z scheme photocatalyst the electron hole pair separation occurs through the inter cross sectional electron transfer between the photocatalyst without any electron mediators or redox mediators under the light irradiation both the semiconductors generates the electron hole pairs the electrons on the conduction band of one semiconductor transfer to another semiconductor valance band via inter cross section of the heterojunction without any mediators which eliminated the photon shielding problem caused by the redox mediators and it leads to enhance the higher light absorption ability of the photocatalyst 41 the structural optical morphological and magnetic properties of as prepared catalyst were discussed in detail the nanocomposite shows the highest degradation efficiency compared to bare g c3n4 and pure znfe2o4 due to its synergistic effect and effective separation of photo induced electron hole pairs meanwhile the recycling process displays the stability of the as prepared

the as synthesised nanoparticles was analysed using powder x ray diffraction as shown in fig 1 from the xrd results it was clearly observed that the bare g c3n4 contains two peaks located at 13 41 and 27 69 corresponds to the planes 100 and 002 respectively the diffraction peak at 13 41 with the inter planar spacing d value of 0 659 nm indexed to in plane structural repeated tri s triazine unit the d space value of 0 321 nm suggests that the plane 002 assigned to graphitic interlayers 43 44 the xrd pattern of pure znfe2o4 confirmed that the fcc crystal structure with fd3m space group which is well matched with jcpds card 89 1011 the observed diffraction peaks at 18 20 30 03 35 28 36 88 42 86 53 25 56 79 62 23 and 73 50 indexed to 111 220 311 222 400 422 333 440 and 533 respectively 8 9 the pure phase of the znfe2o4 was confirmed by the absence of secondary phases such as fe2o3 or zno from the x ray diffraction pattern it was concluded that the peak intensity of znfe2o4 was increased while increasing the amount of zn and fe precursors meanwhile the intensity of the g c3n4 gets decreased with increasing the znfe2o4 intensity the result suggested that the incorporation of znfe2o4 reduces the polymerisation of carbon nitride and prove the guest host interaction between metal ions and the carbon nitride matrix 42 besides the peak shift also observed in the carbon nitride from 27 69 to 27 53 with increase the d space value of 0 321 to 0 323 nm which is shown in fig s1 a according to bragg s law the increasing inter planar distance between the planes 002 attributes to the slackened packing of conjugated graphitic system 43 44 in addition to this there is a peak shift has been observed in the znfe2o4 fig s1 b phase to lower 2theta which indicates the crystallinity of zfo affected by the g c3n4 matrixes the average crystallite size of the znfe2o4 and carbon nitride nanoparticles was calculated by debye scherrer s formula by taking the fwhm full width half maximum of plane 311 and 002 respectively the calculated average crystallite size of 22 nm and 5 nm attributed to the pure znfe2o4 and bare g c3n4 respectively the average crystallite size of nife2o4 nanoparticles in the composite reduced to 15 nm for 0 5 zfo g cn and 18 nm for 1 zfo g cn the increasing crystallite size of the 1 zfo g cn samples related to the growth of zfo crystal along 311 plane hence the decreasing the crystallite size of zinc ferrite and increasing the d value of g c3n4 reveals that the nanoparticles may be placed between the interlayer of conjugated aromatic layers 42 44 3 2 morphological studies the field emission scanning electron microscopic fesem images used to analyse the morphological nature of the prepared nanoparticles the fesem images of photocatalytic samples were demonstrated in fig 2 a c the pristine g c3n4 shows the lamellar sheet like structure whereas the pure znfe2o4 displays the highly agglomerated non uniform spherical like particles was appeared which has shown in fig 2a and 2b respectively from the fesem image of 0 5 zfo g cn it was clearly observed that the carbon nitride sheets were covered by the agglomerated magnetic znfe2o4 nanoparticles the weight and atomic percentage of the elements presents in the 0 5 zfo g cn nanocomposite photocatalyst was analysed by eds energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis and it was shown in fig s2 a from the fig s2 b it was detected that the agglomeration of zfo on g cn has been increased for the composite 2zfo g cn photocatalyst the deposited zfo nanoparticles on g cn nanosheets may produce the heterojunction both the xrd pattern and fesem analysis clearly indicates that the zfo nanoparticles produces the heterojunction with g cn nanosheets the heterojunction between zfo and g cn helps to improve the photocatalytic activity and benefits to suppress the excited electron hole recombination to further confirm the interaction between zinc ferrite and carbon nitride nanoparticles the transmission electron microscopy tem was carried out the tem image of the 0 5 zfo g cn nanocomposite was illustrated in fig 2 d the tem image demonstrated the zfo nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of the g cn nanosheets the average particles size of 15 5 nm was uniformly distributed on the surface of the carbon nitride nanosheets was appeared in tem image the crystallite size obtained from the xrd pattern is well coordinates with the measured particle size from tem analysis the interaction between sheet and nanoparticles are very strong which had confirmed by the ultra sonication treatment has been given to the composite for tem sample preparation the fig 2 e represents the high resolution tem image of nanocomposite the smooth and close contact area between g cn nanosheets and zfo nanoparticles were obviously detected from the hrtem image the fringes with the lattice space of 0 254 nm and 0 211 nm resembles the crystallographic plane 311 and 400 of cubic znfe2o4 nanoparticles correspondingly the lattice fringes were not detected for graphitic cn due to ultrathin layered structure 35 the fig 2 f clearly demonstrates the selected area electron diffraction pattern saed of the 0 5 zfo g cn nanocomposite it reflects the polycrystalline nature of the composite material grow with highly oriented planes which was well suited with the xrd diffraction pattern the tem images proposed that the zfo magnetic particles and g cn sheets form the heterojunction which facilitate to enhance the photocatalytic behaviour of the nanocomposite under light radiation and separate the electron hole in the opposite direction in order to produce the reactive species for dye degradation 3 3 optical study it is noteworthy that the utilization of solar spectrum by photocatalyst for oxidation reduction process on dye degradation process therefore the optical property of the nanocatalysts was evaluated by ultra violet diffused reflectance spectroscopy uv drs the diffused reflectance absorption spectra and tauc plot of the as synthesised photocatalysts are shown in the fig 3 and fig s3 respectively the bare g c3n4 shows the absorption edge of 445 nm with the band gap of 2 79 ev where the pure znfe2o4 nanoparticle shows the cut off wavelength of 650 nm with 1 89 ev energy gap and absorption tail extended to the near infrared region nir from the observation of stretched absorption tail in the nir region above 800 nm of pure znfe2o4 significantly improve the solar light utilization in the photocatalysis process the nanocomposites exhibit the strong absorption red shift in the visible light region compared to the g c3n4 the increasing the amount of zinc ferrite reinforce the absorption intensity of the nanocomposites and extend the absorption tail in the visible region the occurrence of absorption tail ascribed the electronic states located within the band gap of the nanocomposites as shown in fig 3 the absorption intensity of the 0 5 zfo g cn is quite higher than another nanocomposite which facilitates to absorb the more light from the solar spectrum from the xrd result it was detected that the increasing the lattice space of the carbon nitride describe the intercalation of zinc ferrite particles in the 002 plane of graphitic carbon nitride the presence of the nanoparticles inside the graphitic structure reflects the presence of shoulder peak in the uv vis absorption spectrum the shoulder peak in the region between 430 nm to 480 nm attributed to the presence of surface defects in the nanocomposites due to the interaction of znfe2o4 and g c3n4 45 the results from the xrd fesem hrtem and uv drs studies were confirmed that the heterojunction has been formed between the g c3n4 and znfe2o4 moreover the heterojunction between the zfo and g cn improved the visible light absorption of the as prepared composites due to the electronic coupling of semiconductors and it could confine the contact barrier 46 this result manifested that the composites could absorb the more light energy and were favourable for enhance the photocatalytic process 3 4 surface chemical compositional and vibrational study the x ray photo electron spectroscope xps study has conducted to empathise the electronic states interaction of elements and surface chemical composition of composite material 0 5 zfo g cn as shown in fig 4 the survey spectrum as displayed in fig 4a clearly elucidate the presence of carbon c nitrogen n zinc zn iron fe and oxygen o elements in the prepared nano photocatalyst the high resolution spectrum demonstrates that the electronic state of the elements present in the catalyst which is shown in fig 4 b f from the fig 4b it was clearly suggested that the two peaks located at the binding energy of 285 27 ev and 288 24 ev indicates the coordination between nitrogen and the carbon atom in the g c3n4 matrix the carbon 1s deconvoluted with another three peaks exposes the presence of interaction between carbon carbon atoms 284 52 ev and interaction between c and o 283 88 ev 287 50 ev the n 1s high resolution xps spectrum consists with three peaks positioned at 398 09 399 25 and 404 59 ev related to the pyridinic n ternary nitrogen in the repeated tri s triazine unit graphitic n sp2 hybridised nitrogen and oxidised nitrogen interaction between the oxygen from the zfo and the n in gcn the deconvoluted zn 2p high resolution spectrum from the fig 4d clearly expresses the presence of zn 2p3 2 and zn 2p1 2 peaks at the binding energy of 1022 16 ev and 1045 29 ev respectively the two peaks appeared in the zn 2p spectrum ascribed the existence of zn2 ion in the tetrahedral site of zinc ferrite the fe 2p high resolution xps spectrum exposes the two distinct peaks related to the fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 were displayed at 711 69 ev and 725 07 ev accordingly indeed the existence of fe3 ion at the octahedral site of the spinel structure confirmed by the xps high resolution spectra of fe 2p in addition with the satellite peak at 719 49 ev which has represented in the fig 4 e the o 1s xps high resolution spectrum deconvoluted with five predominant peaks the peaks with binding energy 529 83 ev and 533 01 ev correspond to the oxygen present in the spinel lattices the interaction between oxygen o2 atoms to zinc zn2 and iron fe3 atoms are associated with the peaks 530 72 ev and 532 23 ev the adsorbed hydroxyl group at the catalyst surface was assigned to the peak of 531 50 ev 47 51 indeed the intercalation of the zinc ferrite nanoparticles in the host matrix of g c3n4 was confirmed by the hrxps spectra of c 1s n 1s and o 1s hence the high resolution xps spectrum of the photocatalyst strongly unveiled that the interaction between heteroatoms produces the heterojunction between the zfo and g cn the heterojunction between the semiconductors leads to enhance the light absorption ability and increase the electron hole transportation to the redox process to understand of the vibrational properties of the chemical compositions present in the catalyst materials were investigated by ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscope the obtained ftir spectrum of the as prepared nanocatalysts was depicted in fig s4 the typical transmittance peak located at 804 cm 1 indicates the heptazine ring out of plane bending vibration of the g c3n4 the peaks located between 1200 1300 cm 1 denotes the c n c stretching vibration of the connected unit and peaks between 1400 1600 cm 1 specifies the stretching vibrational mode of repeated triazine unit the surface adsorbed water molecules peaks are located at the region of 3000 3400 cm 1 the peak present at the wavenumber 533 attributed to the metal oxygen stretching vibrational mode of the zfo nanoparticle both the composite photocatalyst materials consists with the above mentioned ftir peaks which suggests that the strong interaction between the g cn and zfo nanomaterials 38 40 3 5 magnetic properties the magnetic properties of the prepared nanoparticles are of the great interest in the process of recycling after the photocatalytic reaction the magnetic nature of the catalyst helps to recover the nanoparticles by external magnet without any loss the vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis has been conducted on prepared pure zfo and zfo g cn nanoparticles as shown in fig 5 the hysteresis loop of the catalyst obtained from the applied magnetic field swept from 15 koe to 15 koe at room temperature the acquired hysteresis loops of the materials are reflects the nanoaprticles are superpara magnetic nature with negligible coercity the magnetic saturation ms of the nanocomposites are found to be reduced compared to the pure zfo due to the coupling of nonmagnetic g cn the increasing the concentration of zfo on the g cn nanosheets has enlarges the magnetic saturation from the vsm results it could concluded that the prepared nancomposites used for recycling process by separate the particles using the external magnetic field this leads to the effective usage of the photocatalyst in the redox process 9 34 35 3 6 photocatalytic analysis the photo fenton catalytic performances of the as prepared bare and composite materials were investigated by degradation of mb and rh b mixed dye and 4 np in presence of oxidation agent h2o2 as depicted in fig 6 prior to the light irradiation the organic pollutants were ultra sonicated for 15 min with photocatalyst to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium and the values are shown in fig s7 the photolysis process of phenol without the catalyst and oxidation agent shows the stability of the pollutant under the experiment condition the degradation plot c c0 of 4 np against the time was shown in fig 6 a reveals that the composite photocatalyst shows the maximum degradation ability compared to pure znfe2o4 and bare g c3n4 among that 0 5 zf g cn composite degrade the 4 np up to 98 under direct sunlight after 50 min of irradiation compared with 0 5 zf g cn the 1 zf g cn composite shows the lower degradation efficiency which attributed to the higher amount of znfe2o4 loaded on the g c3n4 leads to charge carriers recombination from the fig s5 a one can conclude that the 4 np reduced to 4 ap amino phenol and the reduction of np was monitored by the intensity drop at 400 nm 52 53 the intensity of the 4 ap increases with drop of np peaks and the intensity around 300 nm reduced with increasing the irradiation time and finally disappeared the calculated phenol reduction efficiency of bare g c3n4 pure znfe2o4 0 5 zf g cn and 1 zf g cn samples was about 20 11 98 and 59 respectively the first order kinetic plot for phenol degradation was revealed that the composite of 0 5 zf g cn has the kinetic rate of 0 49935 min 1 which is 17 times higher than the 1 zf g cn 0 02876 min 1 composite the apparent kinetic rate constant of bare g cn and pure zfo was 0 00376 min 1 and 0 000380 min 1 respectively the photocatalysts were also subjected to mixed dye degradation under the same procedure as for phenol degradation it is evident from the fig 6 b both the composite catalysts exhibits the better dye degradation compared to pristine nanoparticles due to the interfacial contact between nanoparticles results the synergistic effect in the mixed dye solution the degradation range of mb is quite higher than rh b under sunlight illumination with the aid of h2o2 the maximum mb degradation attains 100 under the sunlight irradiation within 35 min while rh b degradation reaches 92 after 35 min in presence of h2o2 as expressed in fig s5 b the 0 5 zf g cn composite catalyst displays more efficient than pure nanomaterials and 1 zf g cn composite the decreased efficiency of the 1 zf g cn composite reveals the larger the particles size of znfe2o4 in the composite which was confirmed by the xrd analysis the pseudo first order kinetic for mixed dye removal was plotted by ln c c0 against the time has shown in fig 6 d the calculated rate constant for 0 5 zf g cn composite was 0 14376 min 1 and 0 34943 min 1 for mb and rh b respectively compared to this 1 zf g cn catalyst shows the rate constant 3 times and 9 folds inferior for mb and rh b dye degradation the observed kinetic rate constant for pristine g c3n4 and znfe2o4 was around 0 00608 0 00188 min 1 and 0 00168 0 00363 min 1 for mb and rh b the calculated degradation efficiency of the mb in the mixed dye solution was about 21 10 and 71 for bare g cn zfo and 1 zf g cn accordingly the rh b degradation efficiency of the pure g c3n4 znfe2o4 and 1 zf g cn composite was 15 6 and 44 respectively in addition to this the photocatalytic process was conducted under solar light irradiation in absence of oxidation agent and it was tabulated in table 1 the obtained results clearly demonstrated that the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst shows very low without the h2o2 this result clearly revealed that the as prepared nanophotocatalysts have the insufficient band potential for produce the hydroxyl reactive radicals for photocatalytic degradation process the obtained results clearly demonstrated that the as prepared photocatalyst has photo fenton like degradation behaviour towards organic pollutant removal furthermore the degradation ability of the as synthesised composite photocatalyst was compared to the other heterojunction photocatalyst and the results are tabulated as shown in table 2 in order to investigate the active radicals for degradation process the elemental trapping test has been conducted on rh b with different radical hunters in typical 1 mmol of edta and bq and 3 ml of ipa was added along with the dye solution under the light illumination for radicals trapping from the fig 7 a one can accomplish that the degradation efficiency of the rh b greatly affected by the super oxide bq and hydroxyl radical ipa scavengers the addition of edta does not alter the rh b degradation efficiency the added bq and ipa significantly reduce the degradation efficiency to 39 and 65 respectively the 96 and 94 of dye degradation was attributed to blank and edta samples the above results indicates that the addition of edta improve the degradation ability of the photocatalyst which is very close to the literature reports 54 when visible light was illuminated on the photocatalyst large amount of electron hole pairs were produced and it generates the large amount of superoxide radicals which contribute to the dye degradation process when bq was added to the photocatalyst system the superoxide radicals are captured and hence the degradation efficiency was reduced significantly on the other hand the hydroxyl radicals are scavenged by addition of ipa to the solution system and it leads to the lower degradation efficiency under the visible light irradiation the electron hole pairs are generated at the surface of the photocatalyst the photo excited electron can recombine to the valance band holes through direct recombination and surface recombination when edta was added to the photocatalyst system the holes are trapped by the scavenger at the same time large amount of photo excited electrons are migrated at the surface of the photocatalyst these electrons are produces the superoxide radicals either by react with the surface adsorbed oxygen at the catalyst surface or dissolved oxygen from the water these migrated electrons are generates the large number of superoxide radicals when edta was added into the solution and it could increase the degradation efficiency of the dye solution under visible light irradiation 54 it is obvious from the scavengers experiment clearly demonstrate that the oh and o2 radicals are the main reactive species for degradation process furthermore the possible reaction mechanism for dye degradation process was described from the elemental trapping experiment the conduction band and valance band potential of the as synthesised nanoparticles are estimated using the following formula 24 evb χ ee 0 5 eg ecb evb eg where ecb and evb denote the energy of conduction band and valance band respectively ee represent the free electron energy in hydrogen scale 4 5 ev and χ be the electronegativity value the calculated electronegativity value of g c3n4 and znfe2o4 was 4 7 and 5 8 ev respectively the bandgap energy was 2 79 ev and 1 89 ev corresponds to the pristine g c3n4 and pure znfe2o4 the estimated ecb and evb of pristine g c3n4 and pure znfe2o4 nanoparticles are 1 19 ev 1 60 ev and 0 27 ev 2 16 ev respectively but the uv drs absorption spectra of 0 5 zf g cn composite shows the two absorption peak related to g c3n4 and znfe2o4 the tauc plot of the composite exhibits the band gap of 2 64 ev for g c3n4 and 2 ev for znfe2o4 nanoparticles compared with pure nanoparticles the carbon nitride in composite shows the redshift and zfo shows the blue shift these results suggest that the new conduction energy state create due to the defect while making the heterojunction which is well matched with obtained xrd and uv drs results 10 the new surface defect produced conduction band energy for g cn and zfo nanoparticles was 1 04 ev and 0 16 ev respectively the predicted insight mechanism for photocatalytic degradation process as follow when photon is incident on the surface of the catalyst the electrons at valance state get excited and transferred to conduction state the photo excited electrons are accumulating on the conduction energy level of p type zfo due to the higher negative energy of n type g cn compared to znfe2o4 while the valance band holes are transferred to valance state of the g c3n4 the reduction process takes place at the conduction band of the g cn due to the comparatively high negative energy 1 04 ev than standard reduction potential 0 33 ev on the other hand the oxidation process occurred at the valance band of the znfe2o4 due to the high positive energy 2 16 ev compared with standard oxidation potential 1 99 ev 24 the conduction band of the zfo and valance band of the g cn does not contribute any redox process because the lower potential than standard redox energy the p n heterojunction formation causes the down bend in g c3n4 conduction energy level and up bend at the conduction band of the zfo 10 from the elemental trapping experiment it was found that though holes at valance level of zfo have higher potential energy than standard oxidation energy it does not affect the degradation process in addition to this the holes accumulated at the valance energy level of g cn could not produce the radicals for dye oxidation process but the superoxide o2 and hydroxyl oh radicals only contribute on photocatalytic process however super oxide radicals are the major active species for the dye degradation activity from the above mentioned results the boosted photocatalytic activity of the 0 5 zf g cn composite demonstrated by z scheme degradation mechanism 24 the photo excited electron from the znfe2o4 has trapped by the valance band of the g c3n4 the recombined electrons at the valance energy level of the g cn excite by incident photons the electrons at the conduction band are readily reacts with the atmospheric oxygen and it produces the o2 radicals the oxidation agent reacts with superoxide radicals and it produces the hydroxyl active species the organic pollutants get reduced by react with the hydroxyl radicals the produced photo excited electrons are captured by the electron acceptor for the reduction process and it affects the charge carrier recombination hence the p n heterojunction between the zfo and g cn produces the solid state z scheme process for effective separation of charge carrier and enriched photocatalytic degradation process the proposed possible reaction mechanism for organic pollutant removal as follows znfe2o4 g c3n4 h ν znfe2o4 h e g c3n4 h e o2 e o2 o2 h2o2 oh oh oh dye h2o co2 in photo fenton process iron fe based nanoparticles creates the highly reactive hydroxyl oh radicals for photocatalytic reaction the degradation efficiency of the photo fenton reaction is many times higher than the classical fenton reaction because of the fast conversion of iron3 into iron2 in znfe2o4 nanomaterials in typical photo fenton catalytic process the fe2 react with oxidation agents h2o2 to produce the highly reactive oh radicals and it destroy the organic dye molecule with the release of co2 and h2o the photo fenton reaction and photocatalytic process takes place together in the iron based materials while irradiation of visible light the photo excited electrons and holes transfer to the opposite direction in the photocatalyst the conduction band electron at the znfe2o4 reacts with h2o2 and it produces the hydroxyl radicals on the other hand the fe3 produces the oh radicals which oxidize the dye molecules in addition to the photo fenton reaction the self redox process also takes place in znfe2o4 in which fe induce the oxidation agent h2o2 to generate the oh radicals the self redox and photo fenton reaction as follows 55 56 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh fe3 h2o2 fe2 ooh h fe3 e fe2 h2o2 e oh oh oh dye co2 h2o 3 7 surface area analysis the textural property of the as prepared photocatalysts was inspected by bet brunauer emmett teller analysis was shown in fig 9 the obtained nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm curve for all samples clearly indicates the type iv with h3 hysteresis loop the calculated specific surface area of the bare g c3n4 and pure znfe2o4 nanoparticles was around 15 14 and 24 78 m2 g respectively compared with the pure nanoparticles the as synthesised 0 5 zfo g cn photocatalyst shows higher specific surface area of about 82 67 m2 g the higher specific surface area of the nanocatalyst aids to improve the adsorption ability which supports to the higher degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst under light irradiation the larger specific surface area of the composite photocatalyst not only improves the adsorption ability but also facilitate to enhance the charge carrier separation capability 22 3 8 charge carriers separation test in order to confirm the photo induced charge carrier separation and transport behaviour was studied by photoluminescence analysis and transient photocurrent measurements were carried out and it was depicted in fig 10 the pl spectra of the samples were recorded by exciting the photocatalyst by 400 nm at room temperature as can be seen in the fig 10 a it can be clearly noted that the emission peak of around 450 nm for the pristine g cn photocatalyst shows the high intensity the pl intensity was in the order of g cn 1 zfo g cn 0 5 zfo g cn zfo the photoluminescence intensity reduction of the 0 5 zfo g cn indicates that the composite has much lower charge carrier recombination rate compared to other photocataysts 22 further to confirm the charge separation behaviour of the as prepared photocatalyst was investigated by photocurrent measurements the generation of photocurrent with good reproducibility for the nanocatalysts was experimental through five on off cycles this specifies that the electrode is stable and photocurrent is quite reversible the 0 5 zfo g cn composite photocatalyst shows the higher photocurrent compared to the other nanocatalysts which demonstrate that the high effectual separation of photo induced electrons and holes by the composite photocatalyst 21 the pl and photocurrent results clearly validate that the 0 5 zfo g cn nanocomposite as an efficient photocatalyst towards organic pollutant removal with high light induced charge carrier separation 3 9 reuse and stability test the retrieval and cycle test is the key factor to use the catalyst for practical application the stability of the as prepared catalyst was evaluated by 4 np degradation for 4 successive cycles after the each cycle the photocatalyst was recovered by external magnetic field and washed with de ionized water for several time to remove the surface adsorbed pollutant the cycling stability of the sample was displayed in fig 9 a the 0 5 zf g cn retains 90 of stability even at the 4th cycle further to confirm the stability of the as prepared catalyst the xrd pattern was obtained after 4th cycle it shows that there is no structural changes appeared in the xrd pattern this result clearly shows that the prepared photocatalyst could useful for organic pollutant removal for practical use 4 conclusion in summary the effective photocatalyst for phenol and dye degradation was successfully synthesized by facile sol gel process the prepared composite catalyst shows the defect band below the conduction energy level which is verified by uv drs the p n heterojunction formation effectively reduces the recombination of electron hole during the photocatalysis process the 0 5 zf g cn composite shows the best degradation ability compared with pure and other composite materials the enhanced photocatalytic reaction mainly attributed to synergistic effect of interface between the g cn and zfo nanoparticles the photo fenton like degradation process shows the super oxide are the main active species for redox process and oh radicals also contribute on degradation activity the elemental trapping experiment reveals the z scheme could effectively degrade the organic pollutant in presence of h2o2 declaration of competing interest author claims there is no conflict of interest on this work acknowledgements one of the authors baskaran palanivel

14269,the main objective of this work is to fabricate and characterize a new type of nanocomposite nanofiber membrane by incorporating photocatalytic nanomaterials titanium dioxide tio2 into a highly porous nanofiber made of uv resistant polyetherimide pei the nanofiber membrane was fabricated via an electrospinning method using a dope solution containing 15 wt pei dissolved in a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide dmf n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp the resultant pei nanofiber membrane was further modified by coating its surface with tio2 0 2 and 0 6 wt using electrospraying method the properties of the tio2 modified pei nanofiber membranes were then analysed using scanning electron microscope sem water contact angle wca goniometer and tensile strength machine results showed that 0 2 wt tio2 modified pei nanofiber displayed better behaviour by reducing wca of unmodified nanofiber from 130 25 to 23 35 and improving water flux by 28 although the wca of membrane was further reduced when a higher tio2 amount 0 6 wt was used the resultant nanofiber suffered from decreased ultimate strength and significant nanoparticles leaching using the best performing 0 2 tio2 modified pei membrane significant removal rate of escherichia coli 99 and humic acid 80 could be achieved along with 85 methylene blue degradation during photocatalytic process the findings of this work provide an insight into the design of advanced nanocomposite nanofiber membrane for photocatalytic process keywords titanium dioxide polyetherimide uv resistant degradation e coli 1 introduction photocatalytic membrane is an emerging technology that is capable of simultaneously separating and degrading organic pollutants present in the aqueous solution under uv irradiation the presence of organic contaminants in water sources such as humic substances can easily react with disinfectant products like chlorine to form harmful disinfection by products dbps e g haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms 1 2 thus removal of humic substances is important in the water treatment process compared to conventional biological treatment processes photocatalytic oxidation is an effective way to deal with organic contaminants present in water sources 3 4 for the conventional membrane technology e g microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf its performance is negatively affected by fouling due to pore blockage adsorption cake layer formation and scaling moreover biofouling caused by microorganisms is another main concern of conventional membrane applications 5 6 the consequences of these problems are a decline in net water flux and reduced membrane life span leading to higher operating and maintenance costs 7 although polymeric membranes are widely used in water wastewater treatment plants to separate unwanted solutes pollutants these kinds of membranes are not suitable to be used as photocatalytic membrane process this is mainly because there exist no catalysts within the membrane matrix furthermore the polymeric materials used to manufacture commercial polymeric membranes are not uv resistant and are very likely to suffer from severe degradation under uv light illumination owing to the breakage of chemical bonds of polymeric materials such as methine c s and c o groups 8 9 in addition to the surface chemistry changes alternation on the membrane microstructure and morphology upon uv light illumination could also take place which reduces membrane separation efficiency many studies have reported that the membranes made of polysulfone psf polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 10 polymethylmethacrylate pmma 11 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 12 polyvinyl chloride pvc 13 polybenzimidazole pbi 14 and polycarbonate pc 15 suffered from severe degradation upon uv light exposure therefore there is a need to consider using uv resistant polymers for the fabrication of photocatalytic membranes 16 one of the uv resistant polymers that could be considered is polyetherimide pei besides being uv resistant pei also shows unique properties such as good thermal stability excellent chemical resistance to a wide range of ph and excellent mechanical strength 17 its positive features are mainly related to its high dissociation energy attributed by cc 145 kcal mol and co 84 kcal mol bond 18 19 more importantly pei is commercially available in the market previously ong et al 20 compared the performance of a pei based hollow fiber membrane with a pvdf based hollow fiber membrane under prolonged direct uv irradiation 60 h their results revealed that the pei based membrane was able to exhibit promising oil rejection 97 with no significant change in its physical morphology examined by fesem the performance of pvdf based membrane meanwhile was negatively affected mainly because of the structural cracks formed after prolonged uv irradiation besides separating pollutants based on sieving mechanism the membrane used in the photocatalytic membrane process would also act as host for the photocatalysts to distribute a literature search revealed that titanium dioxide tio2 is perhaps the most commonly reported photocatalyst owing to its low price and commercial availability 21 26 it acts as semiconductor in water purification due to its high stability nontoxic nature and high oxidizing potential 27 28 it requires energy from uv light to excite electrons to produce hydroxyl radicals which are the key to the photodegradation of organic pollutants in water 18 29 among three meta stable phases of tio2 rutile anatase and brookite rutile is the most stable form of tio2 nevertheless the anatase phase of tio2 is preferred because of its optimal performance under uv irradiation it shows significantly higher photocatalytic activity than rutile for the decomposition of organic compounds 30 31 its longer e h pair life originated from the nature of indirect band gap makes the charge carriers more likely to participate in surface reaction samples 32 many studies have been conducted to incorporate tio2 into the membranes made of various polymeric materials for photocatalytic applications for instance behboudi et al 33 modified pvc membrane with 2 tio2 for humic acid ha and tonic acid degradation safapour et al 34 and ong et al 20 introduced photocatalytic effect to the pvdf membranes using tio2 simone et al 35 in 2017 incorporated tio2 into nanofiber membrane for ha and methylene blue mb degradation but the polymeric material used for nanofiber membrane fabrication was pes such polymeric material is likely to decompose easily after prolonged uv irradiation exposure the main objective of this work is to develop a new type of photocatalytic membrane by introducing tio2 into electrospun nanofiber mat made of uv resistant pei material and to use the developed membrane for simultaneously separation and degradation of organic compounds in this work the photocatalytic activity of photocatalytic membrane will be investigated using mb and ha as models some of the analytical instruments used in this work are a scanning electron microscope sem tensile strength machine contact angle goniometer inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms and uv vis spectrophotometer 2 experimental 2 1 materials polyetherimide pei in pellet form nominal granule size 3 mm n methyl pyrrolidinone nmp dimethylformamide dmf and humic acid ha were provided by sigma aldrich tio2 nanoparticles phase anatase average size 25 nm were supplied by merck kgaa methylene blue mb was obtained from alfa aesar while e coli bacteria atcc 25 922 was obtained from sigma aldrich 2 2 preparation of pei nanofibers in this work three nanofiber mats with different pei concentration i e 10 15 and 20 wt were fabricated using a multi nozzle electrospinner nanospinner ns24 inovenso technology fig s1 shows the electrospinning machine and the nanofiber mat sample made from the machine at first pei with a specific amount was slowly dissolved in mixed solvent with specific dmf nmp ratios 3 7 2 8 or 1 9 by mild stirring in oil bath 60 c for 48 h then the mixture was sonicated for another 40 min to ensure the pei was completely dissolved the resultant solution was then used to fabricate a nanofiber mat with the aid of electrospinner three different flow rates 1 2 1 0 and 0 8 ml h were used to produce nanofiber mats with different layer properties the nanofiber was electrospun with flow rate of 1 2 ml h for 3 h followed by 1 0 ml h for 2 h and lastly 0 8 ml h for 1 h the voltage was varied in the range of 19 7 23 5 kv depending on the solution flow rate other parameters during electrospinning were kept constant these include rotation speed of collector that was fixed at 220 rpm and the electrospinning distance that was set at 130 mm after the electrospinning process the pei nanofiber mat was air dried for 1 day before it was removed from the aluminium foil for further use 2 3 preparation of tio2 pei composite nanofiber a coating solution containing 0 2 or 0 6 wt tio2 dispersed in a mixture of dmf nmp 2 8 was prepared and used to modify surface of the pei nanofibers via electrospinner based on the spraying method the spraying process was carried out for 6 h with a flow rate set at 0 4 ml h and fixed voltage at 18 2 kv other fabrication conditions remained the same as during pei nanofiber fabrication 2 4 characterization of nanofiber membrane the surface morphologies of pei and tio2 pei nanofiber membranes were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol jsm 7600 f operated at 20 kv energy dispersive spectroscope eds was used to analyse the surface chemistry content of the fabricated membranes the membranes were first coated with a thin gold layer to avoid charging during microscopical analysis the hydrophilicity of the prepared nanofibers was further evaluated with respect to a water contact angle wca using optical tensiometer instrument biolin where 5 μl pure water was used as a sessile drop and five different places were randomly chosen on the membrane surface to yield an average result a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer perkinelmer frontier was used to evaluate functional groups after the photocatalytic process mechanical properties of pei and tio2 pei membrane were measured using instron tensile machine tinius olsen h5kt a membrane sample with dimension of 2 cm 3 cm and thickness of 200 μm was used for tensile test with gauge length set at 20 mm using this instrument the force ultimate tensile strength and strain at break of membrane sample was measured to study tio2 stability 1 g of the resultant membrane was cut into small pieces and immersed in 100 ml ultrapure water under vigorous magnetic stirring the solution was continuously stirred for 5 days before it was collected for elemental analysis ti element using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms varian 710 es to determine the possible tio2 leaching from the nanofiber porosity ε was measured by taking into consideration the nanofiber membrane weight in wet ww and dry state wd using the following equation 1 ε w w w d ρ h 2 o w w w d ρ h 2 o w d ρ p e i 100 where ww and wd are the weights g of nanofiber membrane in wet and dry state respectively ρ h 2 o is the density of the pure water 1 g cm3 and ρ p e i is the density of the pei 1 27 g cm3 the nanofiber membrane thickness was measured using a digital micrometre mitutoyo and an average value of at least three measurements was used for the samples the hagen poiseuille model 36 as expressed in eq 2 was used to estimate mean pore size rm of nanofiber 2 r m 8 μ δ x j ε v δ p where δx represent the nanofiber membrane thickness which was measured using digital micrometre mitutoyo μ is viscosity of water at 25 c j is the flux per unit area of the membrane εv is the porosity and δp is the applied pressure 2 5 filtration performance tests a dead end filtration setup composed of a commercial membrane cell 01730 amicon millipore ma as illustrated in fig 1 was used to determine water flux and rejection of ha and e coli of the pei and tio2 pei nanofiber membranes the photography of the filtration setup can be found in fig s2 the effective area of the membrane tested during the filtration process was 28 7 cm2 the operating pressure was set at 0 5 bar and it was controlled using a regulator with a gauge nuovafima the average water flux j l m 2 h 1 was estimated by measuring the permeate produced every 15 min for up to 2 h using the following equation 3 j v a δ t where v is the volume of the collected permeate l at the period of time δt h and a is the effective area of the membrane m2 2 6 photocatalytic membrane tests ha was used to prepare a 50 ppm feed solution by dissolving 50 mg of ha in 1 kg of ultrapure water the feed solution was then poured into a dead end cell before the filtration experiment was started during the filtration process the nanofiber membranes were also exposed to uv light type a 365 nm to initiate the photocatalysis process see fig 1 the simultaneous filtration and photocatalytic process was monitored for up to 180 min 2 ml of solution was taken every 60 min for three hours until the experiment concluded the concentration of ha in the permeate sample was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer ocean optic usb4000 rejection of ha and its degradation during photocatalysis was calculated using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 4 r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c f x 100 where c p is the ha concentration in the permeate and c f is the ha concentration in the feed solution 5 d e g r a d a t i o n r a t e c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration of ha in the feed solution and c t is the concentration of ha in the feed solution after completing uv irradiation process the same experimental setup was used to study the removal efficiency of membrane against e coli but without the effect of uv irradiation first gram negative e coli atcc 25922 bacterium was cultured in a sterile luria bertani lb medium ph 7 5 difco bergen county nj usa and incubated for 12 h at 37 c to allow bacterial growth e coli cells were collected by centrifuging at 5000 g at room temperature 25 c this process took 10 min to complete after that it was dispersed in sterile di water e coli samples were collected every one hour for up to 5 h 1 ml of each sample was collected to estimate the number of live bacteria the numbers of colony forming units cfu were checked by plating of 0 1 ml of sample after a dilution process onto a petri dish containing sterile nutrient agar difco usa the plates were incubated without shaking for 24 h to allow microbial growth the number of colonies was counted manually after incubating the plate for 24 h at 37 c 37 6 c f u m l n u m b e r o f c o l o n i e s d i l u t i o n f a c t o r p l a t e d v o l u m e m l 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of pei nanofiber membranes 3 1 1 effect of pei concentration and solvent composition on nanofiber morphology fig 2 shows the structural morphology of pei nanofiber membranes prepared at different polymer concentrations at a fixed dmf nmp ratio 2 8 as shown only the nanofiber membrane made of 15 wt pei exhibits good structural integrity without forming beads large beads are formed in the nanofiber membrane made of the lowest pei concentration 10 wt this is mainly because of the low viscoelastic force of the solution as a result of low solution viscosity this affects the matching between electrostatic and columbic repulsion making the force not able to stretch the jet 38 although 20 wt pei nanofiber membrane shows better structures compared to 10 wt pei nanofiber membranes some of the fibers are stuck to each other reducing the effective surface area of nanofiber this happened because at high polymeric concentration the increase in the solution viscosity tends to increase viscoelastic force due to increased pei chain entanglement this as a consequence limits the stretching between the forces 38 in order to further investigate the effect of mixed solvent dmf nmp ratio on the morphology of pei nanofiber membrane 15 wt pei three different mixed solvent ratios are considered fig s3 compares the sem micrographs of 15 wt pei nanofiber membrane made of different dmf nmp mixed ratio i e 3 7 2 8 and 1 9 with increasing the content of nmp in the solvent it is found that the diameter of the nanofiber becomes larger see table 1 nmp has higher surface tension 40 79 n m compared to dmf 37 10 n m and would increase the resistance to applied voltage as electrostatic cannot overcome high surface tension 39 hence the stretching of the pei solution jet decreases forming fibres with bigger diameters however demixing of dissolving solvents is recommended to decrease the drying time and increase the stretching this is the reason why dmf is required to add into the solution 40 41 as a matter of fact dmf has a higher electric conductivity compared to nmp with lower vapour pressure 42 43 this kind of surface tension mixture influences fibers morphology forming smoother fibers instead of beaded fibers however the demixing of dmf nmp at 3 7 ratio is not suitable to form uniform fibers as it shows variation in fiber diameters which is caused by delayed solvent demixing 40 3 1 2 effect of tio2 nanoparticle on nanofiber morphology fig 3 compares the morphology of 15 wt pei nanofiber membrane coated with two different tio2 concentrations the nanofiber membrane is fabricated using an optimized mixed solvent ratio dmf nmp ratio of 2 8 as clearly shown the surface of the nanofiber membrane is rougher and denser when more tio2 nanoparticles are used during coating at 0 6 wt tio2 it is found that severe agglomeration is taking place and this significantly affects structural integrity in view of this the nanofiber modified by 0 2 wt tio2 is chosen for further investigation nanoparticles coated membranes were previously developed to overcome the problems of nanoparticles blended membranes rahimpour et al 44 compared the performance of both membranes with respect to photo sensitisation efficiency and found the blending method reduced membrane efficiency due to the entrapment of nanoparticles in random positions in the membrane blocking these nanoparticles from uv irradiation this work confirmed that nanoparticles coated membranes exhibited better flux stability greater hydrophilicity and better antifouling property fig 4 a c shows the cross section morphology of the control pei and the tio2 modified pei nanofiber membrane the detection of ti element on the pei nanofiber surface as shown in fig 4 d confirms the existence of tio2 on the modified nanofiber membrane 3 1 3 effect of tio2 nanoparticle loading on nanofiber mechanical strength and stability study the brittleness of tio2 modified pei nanofiber membrane was studied and the results are presented by true stress true strain curves as shown in fig 5 adding 0 2 wt tio2 onto a nanofiber surface is reported to improve the tensile strength of control pei nanofiber by 39 while further increasing the tio2 loading to 0 6 wt decreases the tensile strength by 48 8 compared to the control pei nanofiber as shown in fig 6 elongation at the break point of 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber is higher than the control pei by 4 while for the 0 6 tio2 pei nanofiber breakage is earlier than the control pei by 5 the best explanation of this phenomenon is upon the addition of 0 6 tio2 the nanofibers become more brittle owing to the poor structural integrity as evidenced from the physical morphology fig 3 the presence of more tio2 in the coating solution during the electrospraying process could carry more mixed solvents in which it would severely dissolve the surface of nanofiber matrix and negatively affect its mechanical properties furthermore it has been previously reported that the agglomeration of tio2 at relatively high nanoparticle contents in the polymer matrix could be responsible for the mechanical property loss 45 46 a leaching test of tio2 from the nanofiber membranes was also carried out and the results with respect to the ti element content in the water sample are presented in table 2 it is found that 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber only suffers from very minimal tio2 leaching in comparison to the 0 6 tio2 pei nanofiber the reason behind this is that at higher tio2 loading most of the nanoparticles are agglomerated on the fiber surface without really integrating with fiber matrix and when external force is applied onto the nanofiber membrane during the filtration process the agglomerated nanoparticles have a higher chance of leaching 3 1 4 effect of tio2 nanoparticle loading on nanofiber porosity table 3 compares the porosity and pore size of the pei nanofiber membrane with and without tio2 modification generally the porosity of the nanofiber membranes is very high 86 93 compared to the asymmetric membranes prepared via phase inversion technique the high porosity is mainly attributed to the surface pore structures that are all inter connected and no dead end pores are exist in the membrane matrix with respect to the membrane pore size it is found that the pore size of control pei is reduced from 0 37 to 0 18 μm upon coating with 0 2 of tio2 the results can be explained by the fact that tio2 coating can play a role in reducing the membrane pore size owing to the deposition of nanoparticles onto the fibers nevertheless the membrane pore size becomes extremely large with increasing the tio2 concentration from 0 2 to 0 6 as discussed previously the presence of more tio2 in the coating solution could carry more organic solvents that could dissolve the nanofiber surface enlarging both the surface pore size and porosity based on the results obtained only the 0 2 tio2 pei membrane will be selected for further evaluation in the following sections its filtration performance will be compared with the control pei membrane tested under the same conditions 3 2 performance of pei nanofiber membranes 3 2 1 water flux and rejection of pei nanofiber membranes fig 7 compares the pure water flux and water contact angle of control pei and 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membranes results show that the tio2 modified pei nanofiber membrane exhibits much higher pure water flux than that of the control pei nanofiber membrane the modified membrane records 28 improvement in water flux owing to the increase in the membrane surface hydrophilicity upon coating with tio2 nanoparticle the resultant membrane shows significantly lower water contact angle average of 23 34 compared to the control pei membrane average of 130 24 the superhydrophilic nature of tio2 with many oh functional groups is the reason for the significant flux improvement the oh functional groups are able to interact easily with water molecules through hydrogen bonding and van der waals force which leads to an increase in water flux 44 fig s4 presents the photographs of the water contact angle on the surface of different pei nanofiber membranes lower water fluxes are obtained for both types of pei membranes when the membranes were used for ha solution filtration as shown in fig 8 compared to their respective pure water flux the flux value is decreased by 7 and 3 in the pei and tio2 pei nanofiber membranes respectively the reduced water flux can be due to the concentration polarization effect resulting from the deposition of ha on the surface of pei nanofiber membranes the flux reduction is not significant in this case as the experiment was carried out only for a short period of time with respect to separation performance the tio2 modified nanofiber membrane shows higher ha rejection 62 than that of the control pei nanofiber membrane 53 the increase in ha rejection can be explained by the fact that the presence of tio2 on the top of the nanofiber membrane reduces the pore size which increases its capability towards higher rejection 3 2 2 photocatalytic performance of pei based nanofiber membranes 3 2 2 1 photocatalytic dye degradation in order to study the photocatalytic behavior of 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane photocatalytic degradation was conducted using mb under uv 365 nm fig 9 shows the dye degradation for the control mb alone without membrane pei and 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane as a function of degradation time under uv light illumination the 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane shows 85 reduction in mb concentration compared to 25 and 16 shown by the pei nanofiber 25 and the control sample respectively as an explanation of the degradation process an anatase tio2 was used to modify pei nanofiber membrane primarily due to its optimal performance under uv irradiation the mechanism of degradation can be explained as follows when tio2 is irradiated by uv light whose energy is higher than the band gap energy valence band of tio2 electrons at the valence band are excited to the conduction band leaving positive charge holes in the valence band these have a potential to oxidize water by forming a hydroxyl radical oh 47 compared to other studies that also utilized polymeric membranes 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane of this work shows better degradation of mb one study that is related to pvc incorporated with 3 tio2 only achieved 83 dye degradation under uv light irradiation while in another study the degradation of mb was only 60 70 using tio2 ceramic membrane 48 3 2 2 2 photocatalytic degradation of humic acid fig 10 compares the degradation of ha using 0 2 tio2 pei nanofibers with and without uv irradiation results show that the tio2 pei nanofiber membrane achieves 71 8 ha degradation under uv light illumination compared to 1 without uv light exposure in addition the photocatalysis based membrane also shows higher rejection 78 7 under uv light illumination compared to without uv light exposure 62 1 fig 11 fig s5 presents the water flux profile of nanofiber membranes over a period of 48 h under uv light illumination generally the nanofiber membranes demonstrate quite stable flux performance for the entire testing period 3 2 3 photocatalysis densification of e coli fig 12 shows the antibacterial performance of 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane against e coli under uv light illumination it is found that the membrane exhibits a significant antibacterial property in which the filtration accompanied with photocatalysis process could achieve up to 99 disinfection after 5 h operation as a comparison the membrane without uv light exposure only shows 53 removal many studies related to the mf membranes and nanoparticles modified membranes can be found in the literature to inhibit the growth of e coli in water for instance rahimpour et al 49 reported that upon addition of 4 tio2 into pvdf spes membrane a great number of the e coli could be killed damodar et al 50 also found that the use of pvdf membrane incorporated with 4 tio2 could eliminate 100 of e coli the degradation of e coli cfu is 83 using the tio2 pei nanofiber membrane under uv light as shown in fig s6 without exposing the membrane to uv light the bacteria are gradually increased with time by almost 36 after 5 h it is well known that the antimicrobial activity of tio2 can be attributed to the production of oh oh is a kind of oxygen species which is very responsive aimlessly assaults polysaccharides membrane proteins and film lipids and these are important factors in maintaining the membrane integrity in bacterial cells 3 3 effect of uv irradiation on the pei membrane property fig 13 compares the ftir spectra of the pei and 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membranes before and after 48 h uv light exposure both membranes were analysed after they were used for ha filtration tests as can be clearly seen there is no significant change on the peak intensity of both membranes indicating pei is resistant towards uv degradation the existence of characteristic peaks at 747 1240 1360 1777 and 2696 cm 1 are corresponding to imide coc cn and co bonding of pei respectively hergenrother et al 17 also reported that pei is highly resistant against uv attacks owing to its co bond which has high dissociation energy 4 conclusions in this work we reported that a nanofiber membrane with good structural integrity could be fabricated using appropriate pei concentration 15 wt and dmf nmp mixed solvent ratio 2 8 these conditions are crucial to produce nanocomposite nanofiber membranes incorporating tio2 nanoparticles 0 2 wt for simultaneous separation and degradation of organic pollutants besides exhibiting higher water flux better mechanical strength and enhanced hydrophilicity the tio2 modified nanofiber membrane also demonstrated higher ha rejection rate as well as greater degradation against organic pollutants ha and mb under uv irradiation in comparison to the control pei membrane it was also found that the 0 2 tio2 pei membrane only suffered from very minimal loss of tio2 the presence of tio2 in the nanofiber structure also played an important role by inhibiting the growth of e coli more importantly the pei nanofiber membrane is found to be a suitable material to host the tio2 owing to its uv resistant properties ensuring its sustainability for water treatment process declaration of competing

14269,the main objective of this work is to fabricate and characterize a new type of nanocomposite nanofiber membrane by incorporating photocatalytic nanomaterials titanium dioxide tio2 into a highly porous nanofiber made of uv resistant polyetherimide pei the nanofiber membrane was fabricated via an electrospinning method using a dope solution containing 15 wt pei dissolved in a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide dmf n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp the resultant pei nanofiber membrane was further modified by coating its surface with tio2 0 2 and 0 6 wt using electrospraying method the properties of the tio2 modified pei nanofiber membranes were then analysed using scanning electron microscope sem water contact angle wca goniometer and tensile strength machine results showed that 0 2 wt tio2 modified pei nanofiber displayed better behaviour by reducing wca of unmodified nanofiber from 130 25 to 23 35 and improving water flux by 28 although the wca of membrane was further reduced when a higher tio2 amount 0 6 wt was used the resultant nanofiber suffered from decreased ultimate strength and significant nanoparticles leaching using the best performing 0 2 tio2 modified pei membrane significant removal rate of escherichia coli 99 and humic acid 80 could be achieved along with 85 methylene blue degradation during photocatalytic process the findings of this work provide an insight into the design of advanced nanocomposite nanofiber membrane for photocatalytic process keywords titanium dioxide polyetherimide uv resistant degradation e coli 1 introduction photocatalytic membrane is an emerging technology that is capable of simultaneously separating and degrading organic pollutants present in the aqueous solution under uv irradiation the presence of organic contaminants in water sources such as humic substances can easily react with disinfectant products like chlorine to form harmful disinfection by products dbps e g haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms 1 2 thus removal of humic substances is important in the water treatment process compared to conventional biological treatment processes photocatalytic oxidation is an effective way to deal with organic contaminants present in water sources 3 4 for the conventional membrane technology e g microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf its performance is negatively affected by fouling due to pore blockage adsorption cake layer formation and scaling moreover biofouling caused by microorganisms is another main concern of conventional membrane applications 5 6 the consequences of these problems are a decline in net water flux and reduced membrane life span leading to higher operating and maintenance costs 7 although polymeric membranes are widely used in water wastewater treatment plants to separate unwanted solutes pollutants these kinds of membranes are not suitable to be used as photocatalytic membrane process this is mainly because there exist no catalysts within the membrane matrix furthermore the polymeric materials used to manufacture commercial polymeric membranes are not uv resistant and are very likely to suffer from severe degradation under uv light illumination owing to the breakage of chemical bonds of polymeric materials such as methine c s and c o groups 8 9 in addition to the surface chemistry changes alternation on the membrane microstructure and morphology upon uv light illumination could also take place which reduces membrane separation efficiency many studies have reported that the membranes made of polysulfone psf polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 10 polymethylmethacrylate pmma 11 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 12 polyvinyl chloride pvc 13 polybenzimidazole pbi 14 and polycarbonate pc 15 suffered from severe degradation upon uv light exposure therefore there is a need to consider using uv resistant polymers for the fabrication of photocatalytic membranes 16 one of the uv resistant polymers that could be considered is polyetherimide pei besides being uv resistant pei also shows unique properties such as good thermal stability excellent chemical resistance to a wide range of ph and excellent mechanical strength 17 its positive features are mainly related to its high dissociation energy attributed by cc 145 kcal mol and co 84 kcal mol bond 18 19 more importantly pei is commercially available in the market previously ong et al 20 compared the performance of a pei based hollow fiber membrane with a pvdf based hollow fiber membrane under prolonged direct uv irradiation 60 h their results revealed that the pei based membrane was able to exhibit promising oil rejection 97 with no significant change in its physical morphology examined by fesem the performance of pvdf based membrane meanwhile was negatively affected mainly because of the structural cracks formed after prolonged uv irradiation besides separating pollutants based on sieving mechanism the membrane used in the photocatalytic membrane process would also act as host for the photocatalysts to distribute a literature search revealed that titanium dioxide tio2 is perhaps the most commonly reported photocatalyst owing to its low price and commercial availability 21 26 it acts as semiconductor in water purification due to its high stability nontoxic nature and high oxidizing potential 27 28 it requires energy from uv light to excite electrons to produce hydroxyl radicals which are the key to the photodegradation of organic pollutants in water 18 29 among three meta stable phases of tio2 rutile anatase and brookite rutile is the most stable form of tio2 nevertheless the anatase phase of tio2 is preferred because of its optimal performance under uv irradiation it shows significantly higher photocatalytic activity than rutile for the decomposition of organic compounds 30 31 its longer e h pair life originated from the nature of indirect band gap makes the charge carriers more likely to participate in surface reaction samples 32 many studies have been conducted to incorporate tio2 into the membranes made of various polymeric materials for photocatalytic applications for instance behboudi et al 33 modified pvc membrane with 2 tio2 for humic acid ha and tonic acid degradation safapour et al 34 and ong et al 20 introduced photocatalytic effect to the pvdf membranes using tio2 simone et al 35 in 2017 incorporated tio2 into nanofiber membrane for ha and methylene blue mb degradation but the polymeric material used for nanofiber membrane fabrication was pes such polymeric material is likely to decompose easily after prolonged uv irradiation exposure the main objective of this work is to develop a new type of photocatalytic membrane by introducing tio2 into electrospun nanofiber mat made of uv resistant pei material and to use the developed membrane for simultaneously separation and degradation of organic compounds in this work the photocatalytic activity of photocatalytic membrane will be investigated using mb and ha as models some of the analytical instruments used in this work are a scanning electron microscope sem tensile strength machine contact angle goniometer inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms and uv vis spectrophotometer 2 experimental 2 1 materials polyetherimide pei in pellet form nominal granule size 3 mm n methyl pyrrolidinone nmp dimethylformamide dmf and humic acid ha were provided by sigma aldrich tio2 nanoparticles phase anatase average size 25 nm were supplied by merck kgaa methylene blue mb was obtained from alfa aesar while e coli bacteria atcc 25 922 was obtained from sigma aldrich 2 2 preparation of pei nanofibers in this work three nanofiber mats with different pei concentration i e 10 15 and 20 wt were fabricated using a multi nozzle electrospinner nanospinner ns24 inovenso technology fig s1 shows the electrospinning machine and the nanofiber mat sample made from the machine at first pei with a specific amount was slowly dissolved in mixed solvent with specific dmf nmp ratios 3 7 2 8 or 1 9 by mild stirring in oil bath 60 c for 48 h then the mixture was sonicated for another 40 min to ensure the pei was completely dissolved the resultant solution was then used to fabricate a nanofiber mat with the aid of electrospinner three different flow rates 1 2 1 0 and 0 8 ml h were used to produce nanofiber mats with different layer properties the nanofiber was electrospun with flow rate of 1 2 ml h for 3 h followed by 1 0 ml h for 2 h and lastly 0 8 ml h for 1 h the voltage was varied in the range of 19 7 23 5 kv depending on the solution flow rate other parameters during electrospinning were kept constant these include rotation speed of collector that was fixed at 220 rpm and the electrospinning distance that was set at 130 mm after the electrospinning process the pei nanofiber mat was air dried for 1 day before it was removed from the aluminium foil for further use 2 3 preparation of tio2 pei composite nanofiber a coating solution containing 0 2 or 0 6 wt tio2 dispersed in a mixture of dmf nmp 2 8 was prepared and used to modify surface of the pei nanofibers via electrospinner based on the spraying method the spraying process was carried out for 6 h with a flow rate set at 0 4 ml h and fixed voltage at 18 2 kv other fabrication conditions remained the same as during pei nanofiber fabrication 2 4 characterization of nanofiber membrane the surface morphologies of pei and tio2 pei nanofiber membranes were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol jsm 7600 f operated at 20 kv energy dispersive spectroscope eds was used to analyse the surface chemistry content of the fabricated membranes the membranes were first coated with a thin gold layer to avoid charging during microscopical analysis the hydrophilicity of the prepared nanofibers was further evaluated with respect to a water contact angle wca using optical tensiometer instrument biolin where 5 μl pure water was used as a sessile drop and five different places were randomly chosen on the membrane surface to yield an average result a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer perkinelmer frontier was used to evaluate functional groups after the photocatalytic process mechanical properties of pei and tio2 pei membrane were measured using instron tensile machine tinius olsen h5kt a membrane sample with dimension of 2 cm 3 cm and thickness of 200 μm was used for tensile test with gauge length set at 20 mm using this instrument the force ultimate tensile strength and strain at break of membrane sample was measured to study tio2 stability 1 g of the resultant membrane was cut into small pieces and immersed in 100 ml ultrapure water under vigorous magnetic stirring the solution was continuously stirred for 5 days before it was collected for elemental analysis ti element using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms varian 710 es to determine the possible tio2 leaching from the nanofiber porosity ε was measured by taking into consideration the nanofiber membrane weight in wet ww and dry state wd using the following equation 1 ε w w w d ρ h 2 o w w w d ρ h 2 o w d ρ p e i 100 where ww and wd are the weights g of nanofiber membrane in wet and dry state respectively ρ h 2 o is the density of the pure water 1 g cm3 and ρ p e i is the density of the pei 1 27 g cm3 the nanofiber membrane thickness was measured using a digital micrometre mitutoyo and an average value of at least three measurements was used for the samples the hagen poiseuille model 36 as expressed in eq 2 was used to estimate mean pore size rm of nanofiber 2 r m 8 μ δ x j ε v δ p where δx represent the nanofiber membrane thickness which was measured using digital micrometre mitutoyo μ is viscosity of water at 25 c j is the flux per unit area of the membrane εv is the porosity and δp is the applied pressure 2 5 filtration performance tests a dead end filtration setup composed of a commercial membrane cell 01730 amicon millipore ma as illustrated in fig 1 was used to determine water flux and rejection of ha and e coli of the pei and tio2 pei nanofiber membranes the photography of the filtration setup can be found in fig s2 the effective area of the membrane tested during the filtration process was 28 7 cm2 the operating pressure was set at 0 5 bar and it was controlled using a regulator with a gauge nuovafima the average water flux j l m 2 h 1 was estimated by measuring the permeate produced every 15 min for up to 2 h using the following equation 3 j v a δ t where v is the volume of the collected permeate l at the period of time δt h and a is the effective area of the membrane m2 2 6 photocatalytic membrane tests ha was used to prepare a 50 ppm feed solution by dissolving 50 mg of ha in 1 kg of ultrapure water the feed solution was then poured into a dead end cell before the filtration experiment was started during the filtration process the nanofiber membranes were also exposed to uv light type a 365 nm to initiate the photocatalysis process see fig 1 the simultaneous filtration and photocatalytic process was monitored for up to 180 min 2 ml of solution was taken every 60 min for three hours until the experiment concluded the concentration of ha in the permeate sample was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer ocean optic usb4000 rejection of ha and its degradation during photocatalysis was calculated using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 4 r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c f x 100 where c p is the ha concentration in the permeate and c f is the ha concentration in the feed solution 5 d e g r a d a t i o n r a t e c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration of ha in the feed solution and c t is the concentration of ha in the feed solution after completing uv irradiation process the same experimental setup was used to study the removal efficiency of membrane against e coli but without the effect of uv irradiation first gram negative e coli atcc 25922 bacterium was cultured in a sterile luria bertani lb medium ph 7 5 difco bergen county nj usa and incubated for 12 h at 37 c to allow bacterial growth e coli cells were collected by centrifuging at 5000 g at room temperature 25 c this process took 10 min to complete after that it was dispersed in sterile di water e coli samples were collected every one hour for up to 5 h 1 ml of each sample was collected to estimate the number of live bacteria the numbers of colony forming units cfu were checked by plating of 0 1 ml of sample after a dilution process onto a petri dish containing sterile nutrient agar difco usa the plates were incubated without shaking for 24 h to allow microbial growth the number of colonies was counted manually after incubating the plate for 24 h at 37 c 37 6 c f u m l n u m b e r o f c o l o n i e s d i l u t i o n f a c t o r p l a t e d v o l u m e m l 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of pei nanofiber membranes 3 1 1 effect of pei concentration and solvent composition on nanofiber morphology fig 2 shows the structural morphology of pei nanofiber membranes prepared at different polymer concentrations at a fixed dmf nmp ratio 2 8 as shown only the nanofiber membrane made of 15 wt pei exhibits good structural integrity without forming beads large beads are formed in the nanofiber membrane made of the lowest pei concentration 10 wt this is mainly because of the low viscoelastic force of the solution as a result of low solution viscosity this affects the matching between electrostatic and columbic repulsion making the force not able to stretch the jet 38 although 20 wt pei nanofiber membrane shows better structures compared to 10 wt pei nanofiber membranes some of the fibers are stuck to each other reducing the effective surface area of nanofiber this happened because at high polymeric concentration the increase in the solution viscosity tends to increase viscoelastic force due to increased pei chain entanglement this as a consequence limits the stretching between the forces 38 in order to further investigate the effect of mixed solvent dmf nmp ratio on the morphology of pei nanofiber membrane 15 wt pei three different mixed solvent ratios are considered fig s3 compares the sem micrographs of 15 wt pei nanofiber membrane made of different dmf nmp mixed ratio i e 3 7 2 8 and 1 9 with increasing the content of nmp in the solvent it is found that the diameter of the nanofiber becomes larger see table 1 nmp has higher surface tension 40 79 n m compared to dmf 37 10 n m and would increase the resistance to applied voltage as electrostatic cannot overcome high surface tension 39 hence the stretching of the pei solution jet decreases forming fibres with bigger diameters however demixing of dissolving solvents is recommended to decrease the drying time and increase the stretching this is the reason why dmf is required to add into the solution 40 41 as a matter of fact dmf has a higher electric conductivity compared to nmp with lower vapour pressure 42 43 this kind of surface tension mixture influences fibers morphology forming smoother fibers instead of beaded fibers however the demixing of dmf nmp at 3 7 ratio is not suitable to form uniform fibers as it shows variation in fiber diameters which is caused by delayed solvent demixing 40 3 1 2 effect of tio2 nanoparticle on nanofiber morphology fig 3 compares the morphology of 15 wt pei nanofiber membrane coated with two different tio2 concentrations the nanofiber membrane is fabricated using an optimized mixed solvent ratio dmf nmp ratio of 2 8 as clearly shown the surface of the nanofiber membrane is rougher and denser when more tio2 nanoparticles are used during coating at 0 6 wt tio2 it is found that severe agglomeration is taking place and this significantly affects structural integrity in view of this the nanofiber modified by 0 2 wt tio2 is chosen for further investigation nanoparticles coated membranes were previously developed to overcome the problems of nanoparticles blended membranes rahimpour et al 44 compared the performance of both membranes with respect to photo sensitisation efficiency and found the blending method reduced membrane efficiency due to the entrapment of nanoparticles in random positions in the membrane blocking these nanoparticles from uv irradiation this work confirmed that nanoparticles coated membranes exhibited better flux stability greater hydrophilicity and better antifouling property fig 4 a c shows the cross section morphology of the control pei and the tio2 modified pei nanofiber membrane the detection of ti element on the pei nanofiber surface as shown in fig 4 d confirms the existence of tio2 on the modified nanofiber membrane 3 1 3 effect of tio2 nanoparticle loading on nanofiber mechanical strength and stability study the brittleness of tio2 modified pei nanofiber membrane was studied and the results are presented by true stress true strain curves as shown in fig 5 adding 0 2 wt tio2 onto a nanofiber surface is reported to improve the tensile strength of control pei nanofiber by 39 while further increasing the tio2 loading to 0 6 wt decreases the tensile strength by 48 8 compared to the control pei nanofiber as shown in fig 6 elongation at the break point of 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber is higher than the control pei by 4 while for the 0 6 tio2 pei nanofiber breakage is earlier than the control pei by 5 the best explanation of this phenomenon is upon the addition of 0 6 tio2 the nanofibers become more brittle owing to the poor structural integrity as evidenced from the physical morphology fig 3 the presence of more tio2 in the coating solution during the electrospraying process could carry more mixed solvents in which it would severely dissolve the surface of nanofiber matrix and negatively affect its mechanical properties furthermore it has been previously reported that the agglomeration of tio2 at relatively high nanoparticle contents in the polymer matrix could be responsible for the mechanical property loss 45 46 a leaching test of tio2 from the nanofiber membranes was also carried out and the results with respect to the ti element content in the water sample are presented in table 2 it is found that 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber only suffers from very minimal tio2 leaching in comparison to the 0 6 tio2 pei nanofiber the reason behind this is that at higher tio2 loading most of the nanoparticles are agglomerated on the fiber surface without really integrating with fiber matrix and when external force is applied onto the nanofiber membrane during the filtration process the agglomerated nanoparticles have a higher chance of leaching 3 1 4 effect of tio2 nanoparticle loading on nanofiber porosity table 3 compares the porosity and pore size of the pei nanofiber membrane with and without tio2 modification generally the porosity of the nanofiber membranes is very high 86 93 compared to the asymmetric membranes prepared via phase inversion technique the high porosity is mainly attributed to the surface pore structures that are all inter connected and no dead end pores are exist in the membrane matrix with respect to the membrane pore size it is found that the pore size of control pei is reduced from 0 37 to 0 18 μm upon coating with 0 2 of tio2 the results can be explained by the fact that tio2 coating can play a role in reducing the membrane pore size owing to the deposition of nanoparticles onto the fibers nevertheless the membrane pore size becomes extremely large with increasing the tio2 concentration from 0 2 to 0 6 as discussed previously the presence of more tio2 in the coating solution could carry more organic solvents that could dissolve the nanofiber surface enlarging both the surface pore size and porosity based on the results obtained only the 0 2 tio2 pei membrane will be selected for further evaluation in the following sections its filtration performance will be compared with the control pei membrane tested under the same conditions 3 2 performance of pei nanofiber membranes 3 2 1 water flux and rejection of pei nanofiber membranes fig 7 compares the pure water flux and water contact angle of control pei and 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membranes results show that the tio2 modified pei nanofiber membrane exhibits much higher pure water flux than that of the control pei nanofiber membrane the modified membrane records 28 improvement in water flux owing to the increase in the membrane surface hydrophilicity upon coating with tio2 nanoparticle the resultant membrane shows significantly lower water contact angle average of 23 34 compared to the control pei membrane average of 130 24 the superhydrophilic nature of tio2 with many oh functional groups is the reason for the significant flux improvement the oh functional groups are able to interact easily with water molecules through hydrogen bonding and van der waals force which leads to an increase in water flux 44 fig s4 presents the photographs of the water contact angle on the surface of different pei nanofiber membranes lower water fluxes are obtained for both types of pei membranes when the membranes were used for ha solution filtration as shown in fig 8 compared to their respective pure water flux the flux value is decreased by 7 and 3 in the pei and tio2 pei nanofiber membranes respectively the reduced water flux can be due to the concentration polarization effect resulting from the deposition of ha on the surface of pei nanofiber membranes the flux reduction is not significant in this case as the experiment was carried out only for a short period of time with respect to separation performance the tio2 modified nanofiber membrane shows higher ha rejection 62 than that of the control pei nanofiber membrane 53 the increase in ha rejection can be explained by the fact that the presence of tio2 on the top of the nanofiber membrane reduces the pore size which increases its capability towards higher rejection 3 2 2 photocatalytic performance of pei based nanofiber membranes 3 2 2 1 photocatalytic dye degradation in order to study the photocatalytic behavior of 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane photocatalytic degradation was conducted using mb under uv 365 nm fig 9 shows the dye degradation for the control mb alone without membrane pei and 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane as a function of degradation time under uv light illumination the 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane shows 85 reduction in mb concentration compared to 25 and 16 shown by the pei nanofiber 25 and the control sample respectively as an explanation of the degradation process an anatase tio2 was used to modify pei nanofiber membrane primarily due to its optimal performance under uv irradiation the mechanism of degradation can be explained as follows when tio2 is irradiated by uv light whose energy is higher than the band gap energy valence band of tio2 electrons at the valence band are excited to the conduction band leaving positive charge holes in the valence band these have a potential to oxidize water by forming a hydroxyl radical oh 47 compared to other studies that also utilized polymeric membranes 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane of this work shows better degradation of mb one study that is related to pvc incorporated with 3 tio2 only achieved 83 dye degradation under uv light irradiation while in another study the degradation of mb was only 60 70 using tio2 ceramic membrane 48 3 2 2 2 photocatalytic degradation of humic acid fig 10 compares the degradation of ha using 0 2 tio2 pei nanofibers with and without uv irradiation results show that the tio2 pei nanofiber membrane achieves 71 8 ha degradation under uv light illumination compared to 1 without uv light exposure in addition the photocatalysis based membrane also shows higher rejection 78 7 under uv light illumination compared to without uv light exposure 62 1 fig 11 fig s5 presents the water flux profile of nanofiber membranes over a period of 48 h under uv light illumination generally the nanofiber membranes demonstrate quite stable flux performance for the entire testing period 3 2 3 photocatalysis densification of e coli fig 12 shows the antibacterial performance of 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membrane against e coli under uv light illumination it is found that the membrane exhibits a significant antibacterial property in which the filtration accompanied with photocatalysis process could achieve up to 99 disinfection after 5 h operation as a comparison the membrane without uv light exposure only shows 53 removal many studies related to the mf membranes and nanoparticles modified membranes can be found in the literature to inhibit the growth of e coli in water for instance rahimpour et al 49 reported that upon addition of 4 tio2 into pvdf spes membrane a great number of the e coli could be killed damodar et al 50 also found that the use of pvdf membrane incorporated with 4 tio2 could eliminate 100 of e coli the degradation of e coli cfu is 83 using the tio2 pei nanofiber membrane under uv light as shown in fig s6 without exposing the membrane to uv light the bacteria are gradually increased with time by almost 36 after 5 h it is well known that the antimicrobial activity of tio2 can be attributed to the production of oh oh is a kind of oxygen species which is very responsive aimlessly assaults polysaccharides membrane proteins and film lipids and these are important factors in maintaining the membrane integrity in bacterial cells 3 3 effect of uv irradiation on the pei membrane property fig 13 compares the ftir spectra of the pei and 0 2 tio2 pei nanofiber membranes before and after 48 h uv light exposure both membranes were analysed after they were used for ha filtration tests as can be clearly seen there is no significant change on the peak intensity of both membranes indicating pei is resistant towards uv degradation the existence of characteristic peaks at 747 1240 1360 1777 and 2696 cm 1 are corresponding to imide coc cn and co bonding of pei respectively hergenrother et al 17 also reported that pei is highly resistant against uv attacks owing to its co bond which has high dissociation energy 4 conclusions in this work we reported that a nanofiber membrane with good structural integrity could be fabricated using appropriate pei concentration 15 wt and dmf nmp mixed solvent ratio 2 8 these conditions are crucial to produce nanocomposite nanofiber membranes incorporating tio2 nanoparticles 0 2 wt for simultaneous separation and degradation of organic pollutants besides exhibiting higher water flux better mechanical strength and enhanced hydrophilicity the tio2 modified nanofiber membrane also demonstrated higher ha rejection rate as well as greater degradation against organic pollutants ha and mb under uv irradiation in comparison to the control pei membrane it was also found that the 0 2 tio2 pei membrane only suffered from very minimal loss of tio2 the presence of tio2 in the nanofiber structure also played an important role by inhibiting the growth of e coli more importantly the pei nanofiber membrane is found to be a suitable material to host the tio2 owing to its uv resistant properties ensuring its sustainability for water treatment process declaration of competing
